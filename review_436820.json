If I was to list off every single detail of what you can do in this game, I'd run out of space in the review box.  So I'll keep it simple.\n\nThe graphics of the game are excellent.  Everything has a great texture, design, and coloration.  Despite the really great quality, it runs at a very optimal level on a less than optimal graphics card.  Very little issue with framerate.\n\nYou can truly explore the realm like no other.  Make spells, play games, play instruments, and even go on adventures outside of the tower that REALLY change things up.  There's at least a hundred interactive objects that all do something different and secrets to be found in every corner of the game.\n\nThe game also allows for a lot of adjustment.

(I was expecting it to be a spellcrafting game similar to Magicmaker, Magicka or Mages of Mystralia. It wasn't.) (It's also occured to me that a lot of spellcrafting games begin with M. Huh.)\n\nA few things to note:\n\n1. It doesn't have a way to scale the world or align height. I play VR seated, so this made me feel quite small. One one hand, it was very fun to be child sized and mess around like a child... on the other hand, it made things quite difficult to reach.\n\n2. There's no real way to easily grab items. I kind of got used to the whole Rec Room style of \"you can grab items from a bit of a distance\", so I was surprised to see it completely absent here (especially when it's magic based! Coulda just called it telekinesis.) This is also slightly annoying as my VR sensors can't actually see my hands when they're close to the floor, so any items which fell off the table I had to just resign to the God of Things That Are On The Floor.\n\n3. Telepath movement is... questionable. Good idea, only moderate execution. I feel like it could have done with a bit of FOV reduction while moving, similar to Sublevel Zero, Vivecraft or Rec Room. I ended up just switching to Teleport movement because I felt a bit uncomfortable after a few minutes moving with Telepath. (And I'm one to use SMOOTH movement in Vivecraft, with FOV reduction, soooo...) And, before you ask, Smooth Movement was an absolute no. I didn't even last five SECONDS with that one.\n\nDespite these minor flaws, I still had fun with it, and it was free so I can't really complain. I especially loved the one spell which just made all objects in the room float and you could use your hands to sort of influence their movement.

There are rats and bats scurrying around, and sometimes, a giant may peer into the tower window, not to mention that moving armor suit.\n\nYou can use the ingredients to create spells of various effects. There are 8 types of spells, such as fireball toss and making things float. My favorite is the \"Conductor\" spell, allowing me to manipulate floating objects to move in the direction i want. I feel like I am Scarlet Witch from Marvel movies when I does that.\n\nThere are also world globes. By playing the music instrument when you pick them up, you open up a portal that leads you to the room in the globe. One of the interesting rooms is a judge room where you are observed by the 'gods'.

Its basically a magical lab simulator. You create potions that have different magical effects, and then you can apply the effect to all of the stuff sitting around in the lab (which is quite a bit). I don't want to get into all of the magics that are available, as figuring them out is part of the \"magic\" of this experience/game. This is a mostly open world in a single room that you can pretty much move around to interact with anything in the room. And there are things on shelves that are out of reach and all sorts of other room decorations. And using magic you can pretty much play with EVERYTHING in the room. Plus, you can actually use magic to escape the room to go to other \"Realms\" or Locations. There are various weapons and tools that are around too, and I had a real \"Blast\" playing with the crossbow, the light sword, and flinging fireballs around. I thought it was neat that they even give you a telescope that actually works within the virtual environment. Altogether, you can probably achieve the main objectives in the game within 10 or 15 minutes. But I have had fun just playing in that room for over an hour. Some of the magical effects are pretty simple in concept, but pretty amazing to see in action. Being in this experience is like llving in a world that is a cross between some of Disney and Pixar's best animated films. I hope they make a more expanded version of this game, but as it is, I really recommend playing with it for a while. Your inner child will really be awakened and full of glee.

Exploring, sledding, building snow castles, drinking hot chocolate, rolling around in the snow until it starts to get dark and your mom calls you from the porch that it's time to come inside for the night. The whole thing is done in beautiful hand-drawn art, and the soundtrack is pure magic.\n\nIn gameplay terms, it's mainly a fairly casual platformer. There is no fear of death or failure at all, which is what makes it casual. Instead it's mostly about collecting and exploring. Very early you discover some winter elves who grant you the power to glide through the air a bit after a jump. At that point you can begin collecting snowflakes. Every snowflake you collect is sort of like +1 exp and permanently adds a very tiny fraction of extra power to your glide, so your ability to magically soar through the air will get better and better as you collect.\n\nThe game has a night/day cycle and you only have until the end of the day to explore before your mom calls you back inside for the evening. So another aspect of the gameplay is creating a path for your sled as you explore. That way, at the start of each new day, you can quickly sled to your last destination without having to take a lot of time to get there.\n\nIt's a very relaxing and adorable little game, and in my opinion an example of a game that knew exactly what feeling/atmosphere it wanted to capture and then just nailed it.\n\nRecommended especially if you'd like to play something festive around the christmas season. =]\n\n(Note that the game is small and initially only runs in windowed mode.

Wir schl\u00fcpfen in die Haut des kleinen Marvins, dem beim Spielen im Schnee ein Handschuh geklaut wird. Wenig sp\u00e4ter treffen wir auf einige Elfen, die uns die F\u00e4higkeit beibringen, durch \"Super-Spr\u00fcnge\" gro\u00dfe H\u00f6henunterschiede \u00fcberwinden zu k\u00f6nnen. Und damit haben wir auch schon alle Voraussetzungen, um uns durch abwechslungsreiche Winterlandschaften auf die Suche nach unserem Handschuh zu machen.\n\nGRAFIK:\nDer Look von Marvin's Mittens ist toll ! Das f\u00e4ngt bei unserem unglaublich liebensw\u00fcrdig designten Protagonisten an und zieht sich auch \u00fcber die stimmungsvollen, sch\u00f6n gezeichneten Winterlandschaften. Und wenn es dann langsam d\u00e4mmert und \u00fcberall Sterne funkeln, d\u00fcrfte es auch dem letzten Spieler etwas w\u00e4rmer ums Herz werden. Ein kleiner Wermutstropfen: Das Spiel unterst\u00fctzt leider keine Full HD-Aufl\u00f6sung.\n\nLEVELGESTALTUNG:\nDie Spielwelt des Platformers ist in mehrere \u00fcberschaubare Areale unterteilt. Die Aufgabe bleibt allerdings immer die gleiche: Wir m\u00fcssen Schneeflocken einsammeln, um unseren \"Super-Sprung\" zu verbessern; K\u00e4mpfe oder andere Formen von Gewalt gibt es nicht. Optional k\u00f6nnen wir au\u00dferdem Tiere dokumentieren, auf die wir w\u00e4hrend unserer Reise sto\u00dfen. Die Areale sind dabei durchaus abwechslungsreich gestaltet, unterm Strich f\u00e4llt das simple Sammeln der wei\u00dfen Flocken, zumindest f\u00fcr meinen Geschmack, aber trotzdem etwas zu monoton aus. Nervig ist au\u00dferdem, dass uns Marvins Mutter jede Viertelstunde, also am Ende eines Tages, zur\u00fcck nach Hause ruft und das Spiel dort gespeichert wird. Trotz Schlitten und Abk\u00fcrzungen kann einen das doch ganz sch\u00f6n aus dem Spielfluss bringen. Ganz wie fr\u00fcher in der Realit\u00e4t eben auch...        \n\nUMFANG:\nDie Spielwelt f\u00e4llt f\u00fcr den Preis durchaus relativ gro\u00df aus. Zwar mangelt es an abwechslungsreichen Aufgaben aber wer sich f\u00fcr das Schneeflocken-Sammeln begeistern kann, ist durchaus 4-5 Stunden besch\u00e4ftigt. Das Spielende l\u00e4sst sich \u00fcbrigens auch erreichen, ohne alle Flocken eingesammelt zu haben.\n\nBALANCE:\nIst Marvin's Mittens ein Spiel f\u00fcr Kinder ? Nun ja, auch. Dementsprechend werden Platformer-Profis keinerlei Probleme mit dem Schwierigkeitsgrad des Spiels haben. Die Steuerung ist eing\u00e4ngig und funktioniert gut, wenn auch nicht absolut pr\u00e4zise. Marvin's Mittens ist kein Spiel, dass frustrieren will. Dementsprechend stimmt die Balance. \n\nATMOSPH\u00c4RE:\nDer negative Punkt zuerst: Wenn wir uns in ein anderes Areal begeben, dauert das Laden des n\u00e4chsten Map-Abschnitts relativ lange. Gerade wenn wir mit unserem Schlitten durch mehrere Areale sausen, nagt dieses Problem etwas an der Atmosph\u00e4re. Doch das ist Meckern auf hohem Niveau, denn Marvin's Mittens hat es geschafft, mich in fr\u00fchere Kindheitstage zur\u00fcckzuversetzen. Der erstklassige Soundtrack, das tolle Artdesign und die eing\u00e4ngige Spielmechanik machen Marvin's Mittens zu einem unaufgeregten und unbeschwerten Winter-Abenteuer !\n\nWEITERES:\nBugs sind bei mir im Spiel nicht aufgetreten.\n\nFAZIT:\n[h1]Trotz repetitiver Spielmechaniken fesselt Marvin's Mittens durch seine beruhigende, winterlich zauberhafte Art ![/h1]\n\nWERTUNG: [h1]71[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1451912676, "timestamp_updated": 1504449599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510638", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20285058": {"recommendationid": "20285058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051527950", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451977106}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 makes me miss being called back home by my mum after a long day of play\n\nI am awestruck by how precious Marvin's Mittens is.

But your angina decay went so slowly you could not be aware at the time.\n\nTime. You had all the time in the world. Time to find any solution to any mind or heartache presented to you. Time to waste. Time to enjoy.\n\nNow you know how precious time is. But even more, you are painfully aware of how precious any pipe-dream solution to get those bits and pieces back are. Because you are still looking for them and your body cells have long since started to decompose more rapidly than they renew, and your hair is thinning and graying like it's a race to the finish line.\n\nToday you live among hipster d0uchebags hating on anything older than an hour of existence, pathetic script kiddies on your lawn leaving snarky internet comments, sold-out parents with their fake smiles and monster mortgage - everyone pretending to enjoy life after their precious childhood were whisked away. And however faint your hope, you still struggle with the idea that somewhere there has to be a key, a door, or even the tiniest of glimpse back to those wonderful years. And you would again, for a brief moment, enjoy a full, red heart behind your dusty, weathered rib cage.\n\nThis game, then, is my gift to you. It's for all the snowmen and snow castles in life that you wanted to build, but never could because of lack of talent or not winning the gene lottery. It's for the sled rides that didn't have a deadline connected with them, only the sheer joy of feeling the wind in your hair as you lost your mittens and scarf, going so fast down the hill your parents would have a heart attack if they saw it. And nothing could rival the biggest, burning smile that stemmed from your soul and materialized in full between your ears.\n\nIt's for your kids, to enjoy something else than generic Zombie Killer Survivalz, Call of Modern Warfare Crapsh|t Ultimate Edition 3, or FIFA Overpaid License Lawyer Edition. It's pure and simple in the most beautiful form. It's for you to take a sneak peak at and play after the kids have gone to bed and you no longer have to pretend to be an adult.

You have the chance to explore a unique and fun area, starting from your house each day. You have a limited time to explore before your mom calls your name to come home so you have to make the most of your exploring each day. You get to explore forests, mountains, caves, and other areas, all set in a beautiful winter landscape. There are no enemies to fight, no weapons to use, and no skills to level up. This is just a relaxing way to spend a few hours looking for your lost mitten. You also have the chance to collect items and see some rare animals. The animals you find can be added to your sketchbook. The snowflakes you collect allow you to jump higher and race your sled faster across the snow. This game will take you back to your childhood when you would go out tobogganing all day and come home with your lips frozen. But boy did you have a fun day.\n\nThe graphics and artwork are incredible as everything was hand drawn. The music is perfect for the winter setting. The game is a nice break from the other more intense games out there. The game also does not take itself to seriously or pretend to be something it is not. It is meant to be a nostalgic trip back to when your big worry would be to maximize your fun before dark and find a lost mitten. Ah to have those days back!

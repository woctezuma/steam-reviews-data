The only difficult things I am having are names with no faces, not like the Pango, yet like Broodman Waine (hope I got his name right), the guards, and VOID characters.  I know they are not all that signifigant, yet just seems a little weird to me to hear a voice without a face in which our protagists are looking at them.  I know it is Early Access, yet something to consider maybe.   \n\nLet's talk about the story, I enjoy a nice story in which our Main Character is looking in on a whole different culture than his, learning their customs and excetra and telling them about his and where he comes from.  May be cliche yet I enjoy it. \n\nI do have one major concern about the future though, that I hope it doesn't repeat like in \"Ace Academy\" (again, spoilers)   which is closure and cliff hangers issues.  I want to see the game finished until the end and see the hero triumpht, like maybe defeating the rival company who reversed engineered our Ace Academy's dad's Gear's core in Ace Academy.  I would love to see a choice in our ending, when you guys get to that, yet PixelFade, you guys have the potential to probably make more episodes cause we have a whole world to know more about, and more corrupt guilds to fight other than VOID, than just going to temples to absorb energy and meeting the elementals.   \n\nKeep doing what you are doing for this a fun game.\n\nAlso Happy New Year.", "timestamp_created": 1514769523, "timestamp_updated": 1514770417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38875278": {"recommendationid": "38875278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115138911", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 749, "last_played": 1514786575}, "language": "english", "review": "Since playing Ace Academy I have been somewhat obsessed with Pixelfade. \n\nSeeing as Crystalline was on offer I just had to pitch in to support the devs. Really good work you guys!

Character pathing would be so awesome if the developers get around to it.\n- The \"Cloaked Brotherhood?\"  I would have been fine with just \"The Brotherhood,\" but omg why?\n- So far being unable to go the love triangle or harem route because I'm an aweful person.\n- For the love of all that is holy, MORE Fanservice please!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1513308842, "timestamp_updated": 1513308842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38296906": {"recommendationid": "38296906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053448432", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513239689}, "language": "english", "review": "It has been a long time since I had this much fun playing a game.

So far this developer is very promising with their VNs and I'm very exited for the rest of this game to be released, as well as looking forward to any future projects they create. Probably the best thing about this developer is that aside from creating amazing stories and characters, they listen and are driven by their playerbase to make their games better. A perfect example of this is ACE Academy, apparently it was only supposed to have 2 romance options but thanks to the community on patreon they added my favorite girl Valerie to the game and made some other charaters romanceable which greatly improved the game in my opinion.\n\nWith all that said, so far this game is incredible and looks to live up to ACE Academy, and I'm pumped to play the rest once it's released", "timestamp_created": 1513219378, "timestamp_updated": 1513219378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38251103": {"recommendationid": "38251103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045612278", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513060055}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, this is a game I was honestly reluctant to pick up, the pictures look a little fan-servicey to me, and I usually avoid stuff with overt fanservice and opt for more darker themes in visual novels than upbeat ones like this.\n\nSaying all that, this visual novel actually completely blew me away, the story all in all is actually pretty good, I wouldn't say the story is what makes this game so great though. It's the characters, they're all brimming with personality and so lovingly made, every second of dialogue, be it during the main plotpoints or during the downtime between is so beautifully written and full of life. The humour is perfectly matched (And quite frankly, hilarious) mixed in with some deeper themes which bring you back down to earth, constantly keeping you hooked. The music is spot on, upbeat and catchy, to melodious and peaceful, complimenting the mood perfectly. The animations are also fantastic for visual novel standards. Of course fanservice is in this game, as shown from the pictures, however, it's not overly over-the-top and 90% of the time can be avoided with your choices, however, saying that, sometime following the fanservice route can end up with some of the funniest scenes in the entire game. [spoiler] \"Hot spring Zack\" (PS, Zack is literally the best character ever.) [/spoiler]\n\nThis game in my opinion, blows so so many visual novels out of the water. Of course, as of right now, this game is early-access, so I would recommend saving every 15mins or so, I encountered quite alot of crashes, and the game is nowhere near in a complete state, the minigames are missing entirely, replaced with placeholders. I would say that none of this detracted from the game for me though, I'm more than happy to have spent money to help support this company during early-access, and will be continuing to follow them with full support. \n\nIf you are a fan of visual novels in anyway, I'd highly, highly recommend this game, it really really does encompass everything a visual novel should be. Just be aware of the early access for now, the game is not finished, and you will be wishing the next episode was out already.

Nice to see a deviation from \"Every girl that has art will be all over you\", and that's very refreshing. The story is very well written, and the characters are as well. It's very fun when you get chances to interact with them. As for some downsides, I only have a few and some of them may be nitpicking. In the start, when your character refers to the swordfighting they learned back home, they use Kendo as their example. And yet, in the cover art,  the character is holding what appears to be a longsword. (Not very functional, given the lack of a crossguard, but i digress) I think HEMA, or Historical European Martial Arts would be a better example to use, as that focuses more on Longsword techniques, as well as grappling, knife fighting, and unarmed combat. The Elementals, I feel, could use... something. I'd like for them to interract with the player a little more. Maybe try to nonverbally teach them a lesson about using their newfound magic abilities, give them a new outlook of the world, or just... something. Going too the temples kinda feels like a fetch quest. Go to temple, find colored lady, get power, leave. I'd like the player to at least DO something with the elemental (Like sitting with the Earth Elemental to admire the beauty of nature, only to ponder more about the balance of the forces both creative and destructive, or something of the sort.

Namely, it's your regular Visual Novel fare, but there are significantly more choices thrown in to add flavour to the narrative, but the majority of these don't change the plot much.  I do like this style where it gives the reader a lot more agency, rather than seeing choices as a gate that blocks off one route and leads to another, the choices give personality to an otherwise linear experience.  From a writing perspective this is a real pain in the arse to do, because they're essentially writing the same scene two or three different ways to enable this relatively small amount of choice, but it really keeps you engaged.  It allows the player to inject their own characterization for the main character, rather than the main character being who the author wants them to be (or worse, the main character not characterized at all).  The developer is promising that these choices will develop relationships with the characters over time, but I'm not sure if that's implemented yet.\n\nCrystalline is also using the Live2D technology, seen in some other VN releases where the sprites are actually animated, rather than just static cardboard cutout looking things.  You can see this in the preview video, and while it looks like a small detail, it really breathes life into the characters, even if it's just some simple poses or eyes blinking.  Seeing a character breathing and appear as if they're speaking really takes advantage of the media and gives you something a book just doesn't.\n\nWhile I've been enjoying Crystalline, it isn't... challenging.  I'm not talking about gameplay difficulty, I'm talking about how the narrative approaches the challenges the characters face, and the difficulty in overcoming them.  The problem is the challenge... isn't there.  The characters seem to breeze through every obstacle.  For example, there's a scene in the game where the main character is hit with spooky evil magic and takes a blast right to the chest.  He falls down, says \"owie\" and 2 minutes later he's back as if nothing has happened to him.  He's not even injured.  There's no adversity or tension if the characters just superhero every challenge.  They never lose.  The whole storyline reads like a walk in the park, with the odd bend in the path or pebble in the way.  This is a little disappointing given how well done the character interaction is.\n\nHaving said this, keep in mind this is still an early access title so the story isn't completed yet: as of this writing there are 3 chapters released.  I'm hoping my complaint will get turned on its head.  Or maybe I'm just being a grumpy old man.\n\nFinally, there are some hiccups with early access: some of the lines aren't voiced or the voiceover doesn't say what's written in the text (maybe a dozen lines total over six hours, like less than 1%), and some of the poses the characters make don't match up to what the text is saying, but these are tiny complaints.", "timestamp_created": 1512113402, "timestamp_updated": 1512114043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37969232": {"recommendationid": "37969232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237500346", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513481086}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't play visual novel genre generally, but this game caught my eye and I have to say for the genre probabaly the best 20$ I've spent.

As of right now, I can safely say this Visual Novel has been the best I've played so far. I've played PixelFade's other VN, ACE Academy (which I highly recommend checking out), and most of the problems I had with that have been improved with this game. After seeing how PixelFade takes criticism and the love they seem to have for their work, I WILL be purchasing and trying out their future releases. The sheer level of improvement is amazing.\n\nHere is my breakdown:\n\nPROS:\n- Hundreds of Choices: Most of the choices in this game are just how the main character reacts to a scene, which alters how the other characters react to the scene, or may slightly alter the path of events later on (like choosing to get drunk with Zack or staying sober (I'm also assuming this one, because I haven't exactly tried the alternative. Drunk Zack is too great)). Needless to say, it gives both the main character depth and keeps it interesting.\n- Voice Acting: I'm a massive fan of the English Voice Acting. Whilst some words are mispronounced, it's generally high quality, with only one or two character's voices really stand out as out of place. Definitely massive props to both Leanna and Zack's voice actors, as both do fantastic performances in Episode 3 especially.\n- Animated Sprites: Something I haven't seen before is moving sprites. Characters move around, blink and their mouth is in perfect sync with the words they are saying. It's truly amazing to see such an amazing step in quality here.\n- High Quality CG's: The actual artwork is just incredible. Miles better than ACE Academy, and the only thing I can fault it on is a lack of it. But when it does pop up, it's fantastic.\n- Decent Story: Whilst I have seen this type of plot done before, it's still nice to see it done in a different style. It's interesting enough to keep your attention, and build a nice connection with the main character and those around him.\n- Believable Characters: Every character has a personality, with a level of depth to them. I've thoroughly enjoyed interacting with them during the course of the game.\n- Comedic: I like to have a good laugh, and some of these scenes are just amazing.\n\nCONS:\n- Early Access: First point is kind of a given, but at the stage of writing this review, the game is unfinished. It kind of kills immersion to see the \"early access - minigame not yet available\" message pop up when combat is meant to initiate. And the end of Episode 3 leaves me wanting more. Once it's done though, this wont be a problem (obviously).\n- Lack of Sprites: I understand animating and drawing sprites is difficult, but not seeing who I am meant to be talking to is immersion breaking. Only the lead characters actually have sprites, so be warned.\n- Limited Routes: I'm going entirely off the Steam Description here, but it looks like Leanna is the only romance route at this point. I hope this changes in the future, as it adds so much more to the game if you can take another heroine route.\n\n-Scores-\nStory: 6\nCharacters: 9\nArt: 10\nMusic: 5\nEnjoyment: 10\n\nOverall: 8/10\n\ntl;dr, buy this game if you are happy with it being not yet finished, and want a fantasy based VN", "timestamp_created": 1512047399, "timestamp_updated": 1512047399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.757774", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37951633": {"recommendationid": "37951633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390082030", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513073884}, "language": "turkish", "review": "G\u00fczel ama ingili\u00e7\u00e7e.", "timestamp_created": 1512046286, "timestamp_updated": 1512046286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37950887": {"recommendationid": "37950887", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982585562", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512761825}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought it for my girlfriend, but ended up playing it myself... alot\n\nworth it", "timestamp_created": 1512043280, "timestamp_updated": 1512043280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37942435": {"recommendationid": "37942435", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059882148", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512014403}, "language": "english", "review": "Have been really enjoying it so far.

You meat a girl named Leanna who is part of like a royal knight thing and you come with her since she might help you to get back home [i] but who the fuck wants go home I WANT TO KNOW FREAKING MAGIC!!! [/i], when you come to her royal knight castle... [i] its more like a high school but what ever [/i] you find out there is mabye a way to get home by finding a old man that worked as a teacher at the high school castle so you start a journey with Leanna and 2 other people to find this wise man, but as you find this wise man your story progress further by finding... \n \t[/spoiler]\n\n+Voice acting that is actually good\nIf you have ever watched a anime in dub and the freaking dub was so freaking bad that you just jumped thru the window since it sounded like a fucking donkey trying fuck duck but he still knows its not gona work then dont worry.\nThe voice acting its not half ass done and just putted in there, its made with good voice actors that knows what they are doing, there are sometimes that i wish that the voice acting was a bit better for some characthers for exampel Amelia but its still better then the rest of the voice acting that i have heard... trust me, you dont want to know what i have been thru.\n\n+Visual is good\nThe pictures that they show with the visual effect is pretty good, when it comes to the spacial events when they show a image they are so amazing to look at. There is a scene that i love so much [spoiler] is when the main characther looks at Leanna (best girl) and there is stars in the backround that is amazingly good drawn. \t[/spoiler] The time and energi just to make those pictures and Visual effects most have taken alot of time to make freaking good job.\nI also love that the characters moves so they are not just still imaiges switching around, so you can tell that they are taking their time to make a good game.\n\n+Characters\nEvery character in the game has some personality and its not some lame ass shit like \"friendship\" my favorite characther so far in the game is Zack, he does not give a single fuck about anything wich is the part i like about him. We also have Kara whos personality is pretty good, she acts pretty all might but she can read what people are thinking so she dosent get into truble.\n\n+OPTIONS!!!\nWhen i found out that there were options in visual novels my mind was blown away. First i thought that your options didnt matter at all but nope, if you choose the right option you can trigger spacial events that sometimes can only happen in that time only!!! There is also alot of options not just a few, around 3 each time and they pop up alot and i mean it. There is also romance in this visual novel wich is pretty good and your choose of options can lead to a realtionship with the characters or they are just think you are weirdo.\n\n+Music is pretty good\nDon't really have alot to say here, the music is pretty good and enjoyable.\n\n+You can play on some events\nThey will add so you can play some kind of mini games in some events, so far you just choose whats gona happen. When it comes out YOU bet that i will play the whole game agine with the mini games\n\n\n[h1] What is bad about this game [/h1]\n\n-I AM THIRSTY FOR NEW CONTENT!!!!\nit takes ages for getting new content to this game SO THIRSTY FOR NEW CONTENT, if you want to have a full visual novel mabye its better to get something else.\n\n-Its 20 \u20ac?!\nif i was not so thirsty for this visual novel i would not bought this at all, in my opinion its not really worth it since its in early access so i would rather wait then buy it now. (its still good tho)\n\nSo do i recommend this game to you?\nTo be honset it all depends on you if you want to be a part of the game while its in developent or not, they have a discord (if you dont know what discord is then dont add me on steam) server were you can talk to them if you have any opinons or so forth.

Despite some very minor stuff here and there, this is a great early release that really interested me in seeing more of this world as well as character interactions.\n\nStory: Though it does alternate between slow and fast pacing, and embraces some tropes, it kicks off pretty well, and in all honestly the good overall voice work does help. The overarching story isn't crazy or anything (at least so far) and I hope it picks up since it still feels like its introducing stuff, but the character interactions work well enough to keep me engaged. It's also fun to see how different dialogue choices play out, though as of right now it doesnt seeeem to make a huge difference to overall plot (though Ill admit I need to go back in to see if I might have been locked out of certain options or not)\n\nCharacters: Characters are pretty enjoyable for the most part, though Ill admit some introductory moments feel a biiit rushed. For example, Zack seemed to go through a bit of a character shift early on, only to lapse back into his old self soon after. Its possibly due to a yet unforeseen development that hes connected to, but as of right now it did feel out of place. Still, I really like seeing all the characters interact and contribute. My favorite character would have to be Amelia, but I have yet to find a character I dislike. \n\nSound: Sound is overall good, some good music though nothing really memorable yet. I do like the little sound effects done for the smaller or mundane acts as well as action moments. Voice acting is for the most part good, though some side characters do sound a bit out of place. Also, there were times that mispronounced words took me out of it for a moment, though it wasnt a big deal.\n\nArt: Characters are drawn well, and the little touches, like the gestures and expressions and lip sync really help add to the quality feel. The backdrops are solid to good, with some very cool or interesting ones mixed in.\n\nI will note that the engine needs a bit of optimization work, as there were some weird pauses and the characters would just pop up as if they were being \"spawned\" and the hilarious, erm, physics acted up.\n\nOverall, I would definetely recommend this to anyone interested in a parallel world VN, and would like to hear good English voice acting along with it.

Yes, the game currently is incomplete but it is still a ton of fun. The story seems simple at first but gets more complex as time goes on. I do not want to say too much about the story in fear of spoiling it but it has kept me wondering what is really going on in Terra and what will happen next. \n\nIn terms of romancing I was quite surprised that there was only one option. After having played their previous VN, Ace Academy, I was expecting multiple romance options but am not disappointed by their choice to have only one. To me, it ties in very well with the story and does not feel forced but rather a casual nudge in her direction as time goes on. Having taken such a liking to her right from the start made me really consider my actions and words when interacting with her, really emphasizing on the \"choices matter\" aspect. \n\nWhile it is set in a fantasy world there are many parallels to the real world it drew me into the story even further. At times I felt fully submersed in the story as if I truly was the main character; so much as to even say or think exactly what he did next. There is humor mixed in throughout and it is perfectly timed. I recall several times where the comedic timing had me laughing, very loudly, out-loud. \n\nAt the end of the day I would certainly recommend giving this VN a try whether you are new to the genre or experienced. It is extremely fun and enjoyable with characters who seem simple on the outside but deep down are very complex.

However, I was bitterly disappointed to find that none of the characters permitted me early access - or indeed, any access at all. Regardless, Crystalline compensates for these obvious shortcomings in other ways. \n\nCrystalline\u2019s extraordinary production values are matched only by its astonishingly deep narrative, which has utterly blown me away. Right from the outset, the VN offers a rich analysis of the contemporary human condition. In a world dominated by facebook and the blogosphere, the mere act of running into a pretty girl on a warm day is indeed no less fantastical than the world of swords and sorcery in which the protagonist finds himself. The VN therefore immediately sets out to ask \u2013 which experiences have been robbed of us by the modern world? \n\nThis fantasy/real world dichotomy is similarly used to bitterly satirise our energy crisis. Energy crystals \u2013 a non-fossil fuel energy source - are similarly the domain of a fantasy world. The eventual exhaustion of our own oil reserves and the bleak, lightless future that shall follow are a grim contrast to the bright world of Crystalline. I am unsure whether the fact that the story may only be read on an electronic device is further commentary in this vein, but it seems likely.\n\nThe pango are patently reminiscent of breasts, but are also saturated with \u201ccute\u201d charm rather than more sultry alluring femininity. Perhaps this is a meta-commentary on the tendency of visual novels to oversexualise the young and cute? One thing I appreciate about Crystalline is that it respects the reader enough to arrive at this obvious conclusion for themself. Continuing in this vein, the pango\u2019s voice actress is superb, and imbues each utterance of \u201cPoi\u201d with a prismatic emotional range that powerfully underscores every scene. \n\nOne narrative decision that initially left me repulsed and confused were the sequences of the corrupt treasurer. Higher tax rates are a natural requirement for any socialist policies, and the immediate knee-jerk reaction to them reeks of the modern neoliberal agenda. Indeed, the treasurer endorsing higher taxes is presented as evil. This tacit endorsement of Randian economics was ininitially worrying. On closer examination, however, this reading does not hold true. The protagonists ultimately engage in a selfless \u2013 and thus socialist \u2013 act, in their \u201crescue\u201d of the town, and these actions are presented in a positive light. Pixelfade therefore presents a balanced and nuanced economic philosophy, which ultimately sides firmly with the people.\n\nFinally, the shadow-mage\u2019s mind-control is reminiscent of deific determinism. If we are watched over by an omnipotent god who is able on whim to control and intercede in our lives, then are we not puppets just as the mayor is? Is religion itself a brand of shadow magic? Certainly the authority and influence of the priesthood have historically held great power over rulers. Perhaps what Pixelfade are really trying to say in this sequence is that the separation of the church and state is necessary for the ideal government. This is an America-centric view that fails to consider the existence of Islamic-Turkey under Erdogan, but I expect these shortcomings will be addressed in the next release.\n\nI was disappointed with the lack of romanceable options for Zack. Although not homosexually inclined myself (I have only kissed one man, and then whilst heavily inebriated), I certainly appreciate the firm feel a man\u2019s buttocks beneath my palm. I accept that the visual novel is only to have one romanceable option, but would urge Pixelfade to reconsider this erroneous and, frankly, heteronormative design philosophy.\n\nUltimately, my feelings may best be summarised with the Joycean utterance \u201cbababadalgharaghtakamminarronnkonnbronntonnerronntuonnthunntrovarrhounawnskawntoohoohoordenenthurnuk.\u201d Well done, Pixelfade.\n\nbut serously wen we gonna git our hnds on dem pangos fya narmean\n", "timestamp_created": 1504362751, "timestamp_updated": 1504362751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511441", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34599914": {"recommendationid": "34599914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095186375", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512564840}, "language": "english", "review": "Normally I'm a Japanese VN purist, but I thoughly enjoy this one.

Yet the faults with her are also apparent.  She fails at being intelligent as she practically believes everything you say,  takes it too literally, and fails to understand many neuances that almost every person in exsistance would get.  this leads me to believe she is just another adolecent dream girl and when she finnally wakes up and experences the world, turn into either a feminist retard, or an old dependent child, incapable to even taking care of her own children.  worst part of the game is the crazy option choices vs the actual diolog you get,  reminds of the lazy way fallout 4 did its diolog options.\n\nThe support cast is by far exponentially greater.  Kara and Amy are some of the most intreaging females in a virtural novel I have seen, sadly they do tend to be troops as well.  as Kara is the sexy orphen rouge, and Amy is the book-smart people-dumb analyst.

So I was highly anticipating their follow up and now that I have it, so far, it shows a lot of promise! It's art style is great as last time, the added animations are highly impressive (though my crap computer doesn't always run them very well, which leads to some amusing results in which hair and... other areas, just move on their own rapidly. Though I'm not blaming the game for that.) And it's story, though reminiscent to other fantasy stories out there, does stand it's own in presentation, humor, and it's cast of characters.\n\nEvery new original character really stands apart from their previous project, which I can appreciate. Everyone is so different an interesting and learning about them so far has been good fun. I'm going to leave it at this, Crystalline IS a great project, you SHOULD check it out and give these guys all of your support. From here on out I'm going to talk about some cons I had, so if all your wanting is a quick opinion: CRYSTALLINE IS GREAT, BUY IT.\n\nBut with as high of expectations I had I do have some concerns. This is more or less just to bring them to light to the production team, tops. There's on ne major and one just a minor technical nitpick. Let's start Major:\n\nI have noticed that so far it doesn't really feel like all your \"relationships\" are very open. I have only played through it once and it's still early in the game life so it's hard to tell, but it feels like there's only one real choice so far: Leanna. I'm really intereted in getting to know both Kara and Amelia but it just feels they're more often than not... left out? Especially as any interest in Amelia you can show feels frowned upon (so far) and Kara shows very clear interest in Zack, which isn't a bad thing. They did the same thing with Mayu and Shou in Ace Academy, but here's the difference; it gave you proper alone time to feel you had a chance and you could make a difference in that sense. So far I feel alone time has been all but deminished, save for with Leanna, so it feels like Kara and Amelia are barely options. However this is only up to episode two and things didn't get interesting in that regard in Ace Academy until episode three. I could also easily be missing something? It was stated the system is more intricate this time, maybe I'm just not noticing it and picking things that only lead to Leanna stuff. If so, someone please let me know and I'll strike this whole note from the review as it's my only real problem as I was expecting an assortment of options here, as far as relationships go, but feel like I've only got one. If I'm right though and people are noticing this slant towards Leanna (which I will admit it's mostly a slant because you're around her the longest, to be fair) I do hope the Pixel Fade team can take note and maybe work on that a bit.\n\nMy only other issue is totally my own, not everyone is going to agree with me, but I do feel I have fair argument in my favor. That being: I don't understand why there's no volume for the voice acting? Don't get me wrong, the teams got a stellar cast and they do great work but when I personally play a Visual Novel I prefer them as Visual... Novels. I like reading them and having my own voices in my head, it's just a preference. This may seem like a whiny note, I know, and I wouldn't have even included it otherwise but... Ace Academy had this option? Right off the bat it had this option, in fact. So you'd think for your \"next gen\" game that simple seeming of an option would be available from the get-go? So yeah this is just a minor thing, and if it never gets added, oh well, it's not a deal breaker. But I would like to at least have the option to enjoy the story my way, when I was allowed to do so in an older project by the same developers.\n\nI know it feels I had more negative things to say than positive, but trust me it's not because I don't like what I see. It's just that with these developers I've experienced the most of what they can do, their previous entry being in my opinion the best VN of all time, I was just mildly disappointed that some things felt more stripped down than built up. So I hope they manage to read this and take what I've said into consideration; making all relationship options feel a bit more obviously viable and the option to have no voice acting if we so choose. In their defense though; it IS early in the game's life, they have plenty of time to iron these things out, all this was just hopefully to bring some very, very, very mnior issues to light. Crystalline is still a wonderful experience and any minor grievance I had is sheerly out of bias for the team's previous work.

like a journey that will be worth throwing your cash at. Like ACE Academy, you can expect a lot of references and comedy in the game.\n\nEDIT: I love Leanna. They definitely put a lot of attention on her and it shows so much in the game. So much of the lovable dialogues (for me) includes her. She's adorably cute and stands out in the game.\n\nI'm kind of expecting to cry in the end though from how the story is going.

Mini games which will be added?\n\nHaving once played and spent many nights of my youth huddled around a table running a D&D campaign I'm reminded of this while playing Crystalline and some animes like Record of Lodoss War or Slayers or even a few J rpgs.\n\nThe story is fun, and the culture and characters are interesting and fairly well rounded. The art style is beautiful and the presentation is top notch. This is a visual novel with one romance path at present. The game itself is simple and has very nice english voice acting.    \n\nThe relationships do feel rather organic and seem to flow naturally, I was pleasantly surprised. However, I find the odd ocassion, which also seems to be the case with other games, even Mass Effect, Dragon Age, and Deus Ex to some degree,\nwhere the choices you make do not always come across as you are expecting them to. To some extent this can be frustrating as there's very little explaination as to how your character might respond, and I admit sometimes I felt some of the choices I could make came right out of left field. For example, you might be presented with three dialogue choices to choose from, and the description of what your character might do or how they might respond can be quite silly or out right vague in one or two cases. However, in most cases it gives you a pretty good idea,but not always.\n\nThe game has a very enjoyable atmosphere  and I have thankfully not encountered any technical issues.The animations have had no slow down and I've yet to encounter any bugs.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone who's wanting a well presented, intereresting, and rather light hearted comedic take on the fantasy rpg visual novel. It has wonderful presentation values, an interesting cast of characters, and an enjoyable story. It's a fun game you can pick up for a few hours and come back to. I'm looking forward to the full release.\n\nPros:\nGreat art style and presentation, and animations that bring the characters to life\nNice music \nDecent voice overs\nUnique and interesting setting with characters that will grow on you \nStable, no technical issues\n\nCons:\nThe mini games aren't currently working in the version I tried\nNot every character you meet has a representation or a visual one, which I feel is a lost opporunity to illustrate or immerse a player into the wonderful world of Crystalline\nMore romance options or character paths open to you would be nice to explore with other characters\nSome dialogue choices are vague.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1501813092, "timestamp_updated": 1501813092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34005796": {"recommendationid": "34005796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029311537", "num_games_owned": 334, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1513825102}, "language": "english", "review": "I decided to back this project after finshing Ace academy. so far i must say im really impressed! its easy to get immersed into the world of Crystalline and its characters.

WHat sets this apart from other VN's is the fact that its both voiced fully (minus the PC) and animated. Yes even the unseen side charcters are voiced. the PC (Player Character) can have a first and last name set. He isnt voiced and yes it is a male protagonist, not meaning in bad way could maybe go for a few more with female prtagonists but thats not the point here. Anyways the characters are well thought it even though sometimes they might get stereotyped with in the COntext of teh VN.

I had got this one after playing Ace Academy which was absolutely awesome and was the first game that actually got me to complete a game that focused on the VN genre rather than gameplay. I'm a little dissapointed that there is only one route because the multiple routes bit really added to the replayability of Ace Academy so I'm hoping the dev team will read this and see that. Replayability is a huge thing and while it isn't commonplace in most VN's because a lot of the time people can't make good characters I found that PixelFade's previous work actually managed a replayability that I almost never see. Normally I never even so much as touch a game once I've beaten it so that should clue you in. I bought this game in early access not only to try out the game but to also support pixelfade in their attempts at making this game, as well as to hopefully spot a few bugs which I did. First off I noticed that if you read too quickly and tend to click enough to go through text the game lags to catch up making me think it doesn't load some text in advance. I noticed this same problem with the last game too, except it was even worse in the last one. Also the stacked tall view at the romance in the game isn't exactly all that in-depth, in-depth is generally both stacked-tall and wide. Also Kara is bae, make her as an option. Same with Amelia.\nAnyways for now until some fixes are done and what not my rating is going to be a solid 8/10\nThe voice acting is perfect though so that gets a lot of points.

In most visual novels you get still frames and occasionally mouth movements and eye blinks as extra features. In Crystalline, you get tilting heads, swaying hair, and complete shifts in their body moments that almost creates an illusion that these characters are in fact breathing entities. In this regards, I have to say, it's pretty cool. The creators have gone that extra mile, so to speak. \n\nStory 2 to 5/5\n\nLet me explain the rating I give towards the story. Since the story is NOT complete I have to give it a rating of 2. In respect to the time and effort of what is available at this moment, I have to say the story is really good and deserves a 5 in my expectations towards its final product. Every character is well developed with depths to their characters. There are also many dialogue choices and options which ensures active participation of readers who partake in this visual novel. I like choices. I like having many choices. There are alot of visual novels that do not deliver as many choices as I have seen so far in Crystalline. \n\nMini-Games Pending/5\n\nThere are a lot of hints of mini-games being developed in Crystalline, but at the moment are not available in its early access. I am very excited to see what they are and as far as I can tell there are already at least the possibility of 5 if not more once it is completed. \n\nHumor 4/5\n\nSo far, there is a lot of humor in the story including moments that makes subtle references towards X-men and Breaking Bad. If you are familiar with those shows, you probably will get a kick out of seeing those jokes. \n\nFinal Thoughts \n\nAs long as the producers finish the story as I believe they will there is no better bang for your buck than by jumping the gun and getting early access. The time and effort that went into the novel so far tells me it is probably going to jump in price by the time it is finished and depending on the final price, justified. There is simply too many details and polishing that has gone into the novel so far to suggest otherwise. \n\nVisual novel lovers will not want to miss out. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1501759929, "timestamp_updated": 1501759929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602009", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33987605": {"recommendationid": "33987605", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993613716", "num_games_owned": 362, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502271998}, "language": "english", "review": "As expected from PixelFade another amazing title sofar, just started but there previous title Ace Academy was stellar the whole way through so I believe I can safely assume the same with this title.\n\nAwesome writing\ngreat voice acting\n\nI cant add more now since I've just started but its looking good.

Young Protagonist finds himself in a fantasy world and tries to find a way home while fighting the powers of darkness along the way! So yeah like i said it's basic and does it's job. It gives the characters a goal to work for thus driving the plot forward.So to sum this up quickly the story is no masterpeace but it works. I don't wanna spend much words here so to sum it up, \nGrade: E\n\nCharacters:\nOur cast of main characters consist of 4 People Leanna, Zack, Amelia and Kara. And sadly and as of this point they are all pretty basic, they are all likable in their own way but none of them stands really out. They are all good characters but it's nothing you haven't seen before in one way or another. They are not copy and paste characters i want to clarify that but i always thought \"hmm somewhere i've seen this before\" as of this moment they don't really set themselves apart from other characters in fictional media ecpecially when it comes to anime. They all lack, how do i put this the right way uniqueness. What they need is to shine to have their moments, they need to set themselves apart from the rest of the world. Again right now they are fine but they need to be more than just another edgy teen, just another mage with awkward behavior, just another sexy thief and just another waifu. \nGrade: C\n\nSo now that thats over i wanna move the subject over to the villains. The villians are, in my opinion the most boring part in this entire story right now. They are just another evil cult tainted by the powers of darkness. Wich again is sad because this entire setting offers much more when it comes to villians that just your evil cult of darkness, or your evil wizard or your evil king. These are all things that work as an antagonistic force because they create a conflict but that conflict sure is boring (again in my opinion). It's a simple black and white conflict they want to rule the world of course thats bad and of course our heros fights against this. But it isn't really an intresting conflict. A good conflict is created by having at least two sides with understandable motives who \"fight\" each other (doesn't has to be a literal fight). Now maybe PixelFade can still pull this off and give their villains a good and maybe even a sympathetic motivation. I sure hope so because as of this point in time: Grade F\n\n\nOh and theres another thing i personally want to point out. It is about certain cameos.\nWarining Spoiler: [spoiler] So first of all in episode one we're greeted by professor exavier, i found this one pretty funny wasn't too much out of place and it was entertaning enough. However the cringiest moment for me personally was the \"Walter Wight\" cameo. Wanna know why? No? Too bad gonna tell you anyway! So the thing is this: PixelFade team (ihope you read this) if you put a 100% serious character into a comedy what is that? How does it feel? Awkward thats at least how i felt when i read this scene. Having a cameo just for the sake of having a cameo isn't the right way it's forced. Why i'm bragging so much about this? Because we've had a pretty well executed cameo in episode one already mentioned Exavier cameo. Another thing that i thought that just felt weird is the fact that Mr. Wight fled. Please don't tell me he's gonna be recurring villian. That would be even more awkward you know what i mean like these strange fanfic crossovers in wich Erza Scarlet starts to make out with Guts from Berserk it just wouldnd't feel right. Instead focus on original villians, focus on your own characters. Phew well that felt good. [/spoiler]\n\n\nThe World:\nWell to be honest there isn't much to say about the world it's a medieval fantasy world wich is powerd by crystals. Again it's the same thing with the characters you've seen this somewhere before even if you can't put your finger on it. However theres an easy way to improve this, the lore. It's as simple as that just exploit the lore a bit more, give us some history about this world. Something that is not absolutely necessary for the plot but something to show how this world works why do people behave this way and not in another way? As of this point: Grade: D\n\n\nAlright so... do i recommend this game? Hell Yes i do! Of course it has it's weaknesses just like any story (just look at a song of ice and fire, the books are in the works for years and even they aren't perfect, though pretty damn colose)\nLike i said earlier even if the cast isn't as great as it could be in my opinion we're only at episode two so theres a lot place for improvment. This can still be a shinig example of a western visual novel and i hope it does.\nBut even if the story would continue this way and there wouldn't be much improvments this VN still gives you a good time.\nIt has a likeable cast, a lot of funny moments and is overall completly fine.\n\nSo my total overall verdict for crystalline as of episode two: Grade: C-", "timestamp_created": 1501706817, "timestamp_updated": 1501706817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33976785": {"recommendationid": "33976785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319957049", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512409732}, "language": "english", "review": "I would like to first state that I have only just finished the second episode of this Visual Novel and I am already hooked.

Everytime I come to a decision in a game I normally think of the most sarcastic and funniest way to handle a situation that I can think of, and when it comes to Crystalline I can fufill that need. \nHowever, I will say that the only characters who have full drawings of them are the main group. Character's family, teachers, and other side characters who only appear for a few in-game days are not drawn. Although everyone that appears is fully voice acted, apart from the main character.\nIt's understandable that not everything is fully drawn out, and other backgrounds are reused as the team at PixelFade created this game in a little under a year, which I find impressive\nThat may sound like I'm giving them a pass on minor things like the reusing of backgrounds, and the slightly odd voice acting in places.

My game time is shorter than most people because I have played the demo before so I was just skipping the first part and jumped to the second chapter. Still, my impression of the game didn't change as it was before. The characters are lovable and it's hard to choose a waifu just like in ACE Academy. I'm really torn between the girls. The story is well written and the mood transitions just fine without feeling awkward. In addition, the background music just complements the mood well. The art is well drawn-- the characters, the background, everything! The pangos are very cute and I would really, really, really love to have one. Voice acting is superb; I can feel that the voice actors are having fun doing their work. Because of that, their characters' conversations sound like how it would sound in real life.\n\nI must admit though, I am quite disappointed because I was anticipating the minigames and I was hoping that even just the first fight minigame gets implemented.

The overall production values and voice acting are considerably improved, though the new Live 2D sprite system does cause some significant slowdowns on my system from time to time, something I don't usually experience with visual novels.\n\nHaving said that, this only leaves me wanting more. There are a number of scenes, particularly battle scenes or events such as festivals and the like, that do not have unique CGs dedicated to them, and this does take away from the experience a bit. I understand that there are minigames planned to mitigate this somewhat, but even then, immersion is key to realize all the scenes to their full potential.

The backgrounds in each location are nicely presented, and add to the tone for each part of the story. The character art is phenomenal, not to mention all the characters constantly do something when they're shown, ranging between facial expressions to other characters to simply breathing, which does add a lot to the interactions as the story progresses. The only complaints I would have now is some repeated use of a single background despite the story changing to different rooms, and an example would be [spoiler]the fight in the Raven Pass at the mayor's mansion[/spoiler], where it still uses the hallway background despite being in another room. Another minor issue is the backgrounds feel too static for the scenes they were trying to portray at some points in the story. The character animations do help though.\n\n- Story/World Building: To be honest, it is not an original premise: MC lives in the real world, MC magically gets teleported to another parallel world, MC tries to find his way back using the [strike]power of friendship[/strike] through magic. Of course, you can always boil down stories to only its major plot points, but so far it isn't as in-depth with its world as I thought it would be. Of course, this is only the second chapter, so we'll see how it goes. Additionally, there are points where there could be more player choice for conversations as the dialogue would just keep rolling, and I wish there could be more side events happening later, like the card game. Yet despite these flaws, it remains interesting: the conflicts so far have been moderately interesting, and moments such as [spoiler]talking with Leanna about Alaina Vale[/spoiler] were bits of world building that I enjoyed: they showed this world existed outside just of our little group, and that there is history here. I do hope there are more conflicts coming up in the future, though; again, only the second chapter as of reviewing this so I don't expect all the plotlines to start immediately.\n\n- Characters: Probably the highlight of this VN so far. The interactions between all of the major characters feel natural, and quite a few times I was laughing at some of the comments between them, especially some of the conversation choices. They have lives that they wouldn't mention as soon as you meet them. I hope that these characters only get more interesting, and overall I never felt disappointed.\n\n- Sound/Voice Acting: Nothing really to say for the voice acting besides great. The voices always seemed to match the scene and what the character felt, and it was believable. Music wise though, it didn't feel bad or phenomenal, but so far nothing memorable.\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\n\nDespite only containing two chapters so far as of writing this review and its occasional flaw, this VN has been entertaining and I'm definitely looking forward to the upcoming chapters. For the flaws it does have, this is still in Early Access so I give the developers the benefit of the doubt for now.

When Crystalline was released, I got it straight away, because I enjoyed Ace academy immensely. \n\nAs you can tell, I have already played through the content that is avaiable so far. There are a lot of things that have improved since Ace Academy, for example the graphics, voice acting and the interface. The story is also more engaging and I have the feeling that it fits more the developers style. Everything feels more coherent. I can honestly say that this game is a lot more polished than it was before and that shows that the dev's still have a lot of potential for improvement.\n\nBut there are, so far, definitely a few points that don't feel fleshed out enough. \n\nBefore you read further, I wish to put this disclaimer: The game is highly enjoyable, there is no doubt about that. It is defintiely worth the money, if they dev's keep it going that is.\n\nNegative aspects:\n\n- The voice acting doesn't always match the text, something I always find annoying\n- The MC feels a little flat; he feels way too generic and has too many convenient traits, like having been practicing Kendo, although he is supposedly from the US\n- The MC is also using Japanese terms, which doesn't fit the character\n- The characters motivation is sadly a little obscure, it feels like a typical DND group that is just staying together, because people are playing together\n- Sometimes the voices don't properly fit with the type of character, e. g. a blacksmith should sound rough, not like a bard\n- The pop-culture humour is very hit or miss. There was a particular reference that I found somewhat enjoyable, but it referenced to a show that wasn't old enough to validate a reminder and not new enough to make it a fun inclusion\n\nI know it sounds like I am too harsh with the game, which is why I really want to point out how much this game improved compared to Ace Academy. The artstyle is mesmerizing, the dialogues are pretty well written and the story and world feels really engaging.

While I do love it so far and I am interested in the story that is available so far there are some definite shortfalls. \n\nFirstly, the story. About a guy who ends up in this fantasy world with magic after falling asleep and has no idea how or why he is there now so he wants to go home. It oozes clich\u00e9, right? But clich\u00e9s happen all the time in stories, they aren't that big a deal if they can do everything else well. \n\nNext, the characters. All the characters are voice acted and while it is pretty well done for the most part, it definitely feels like some of the unimportant characters like the guards you find about town have been left with something to be desired about their acting. While most people are used to the Japanese, Korean, or even zero voice acting you find in most visual novels (me included) the English voice acting may put you off. But seriously, don't throw it aside because you do become adjusted to it, the same way you adjust to that irritating deredere who you thought was nice but won't shut up. Well, maybe not quite the same way but I did begin to enjoy and adjust to the English. \n\nHowever, The one character in the main cast I cannot stand is Amelia. Sure, she has her cute points but that voice is so robotic. I know it was deliberate but I genuinely think it was a bit overboard. Leanna is the first character the main protagonist encounters, kind, blonde and sounds pretty girly but can handle herself in a fight. Zack is the edgy guy with a black long coat, black hair, and his weapon of choice is two pistols. Kara is the barely dressed treasure hunter who the other male character finds attractive. And then you have the cute mascot, the pangos. The little blobs with a face that bounce about. Sounds familiar doesn't it? Yes, just like a dango but they are also voice acted. Now that we have touched on the subject let's move on to...\n\nThe references. Yes, I did feel this deserved its own paragraph. They are so blunt about making references it is stupid and hilarious at the same time. I want to try avoiding spoilers for what little we have of the story so far but it doesn't hurt to know that there are characters called Jesse Pinkmen and Walter Wight. And they work in a trailer. There's even a character called Exavier who moves about in a wheelchair. You can probably guess the title in front of the name. The blunt references were pretty funny but I can see that they would definitely put some people off.\n\nThe music and artwork are decent. Nothing genuinely stood out to me, it was decent but I can't remember any of the tracks while I'm not playing so while it was good and nothing felt out of pace or out of place, there were no amazing tracks. The artwork, on another note was odd. Some of the images definitely felt of higher quality than others and had the definite feel of a game that isn't finished yet. This is early access after all.\n\nThis is something that definitely needs mentioning in its own paragraph too. While this is in early access there is a lot of stuff we know is missing. Artwork may improve (don't hold me to that one) and minigames are completely missing from the game - combat being a massive part of that. This game has (or rather, will have) combat in it. While I haven't experienced it yet I am looking forward to it. This romance system doesn't go very far at the moment because most of the story isn't there yet. So take this review as it is - an overview of a visual novel that *isn't finished yet*, so therefore, the review isn't finished yet.\n\nAll in all, so far: I like most of the characters - decently likeable except for the robotic Amelia (that's just my opinion though). The story is pretty good even though it is incredibly clich\u00e9. The reference guage is about to blow and we haven't got all of the story yet. Music and artwork are good enough - they aren't bad and don't make anything feel bad but we may see improvements. And finally, we can probably look forward to the combat. Maybe. Hopefully. Because remember, this isn't finished yet. Don't go and buy this for the combat despite the fact it isn't even there yet. So, to put the lid on the cakekeep, I'd say so far it is pretty good, but has some problems that are possible to change.

The whole story plot is disappointing and a little predictable, but the characters saved the day. I was somewhat invested in these characters, although the story wasn't perfect, the characters'  personalities, the chemistry and all the comedic moments is what makes this game fun. Sadly, the whole drama, the world settings and the history, they're simply not interesting at all. To be frank, in terms of story-telling, Ace Academy is far more superior. And I'd like to get know more of these characters, they're a bit too cheery for me.\n\nThe music is pretty good, well adapted for each scene, the art is aesthetically appealing, especially the CGs background; I hope the artist is paid well because it is that good. The characters design is a little generic, but only some of them, Zack's and Leanne's designs fell a bit flat, it does co-ordinate their personalities and their role in the story pretty well, but not to the fullest potential. ( I still love my waifu though, Leanne <3) Don't really care for animations. \n\nAnd naturally, the voice acting is excellent, as it was in Ace Academy.

I joined the Discord community for this game and the creators seem to be very interested in the input of their gamers, which I love. Just a random note (: \n\nAnyway. \n\nART: Like- I LOVED the art. It's very fantasy driven it seems, and it really does look like a wonderful fairy tale you'd like to learn more about. Constructive - I'd like to see a tad bit more variation, but if the money isn't there, it's still very fantastical and wonderful. It's just beautiful. \n\nCharacters: Like - VERY well rounded characters. Very real and fun to interact with. I can't wait to see how their art is finished to see how they are in the live 2D form. The characters that are done are very wonderful. Great job. Constructive - I'd like to see how some of the choices the main character chooses affects them long term. Since the game isn't finished yet, I don't think I've seen it. But I'm very excited to see it through. \n\nDialogue and choices: Like - Very real voice acting and dialogue. It's fantastic and very endearing. Like/Constructive: I think some of the humor is wonderful, but I'd love it if it was more pushy. It's inorganic at times because it seems to sell the easy joke, but if it was more clever I think that would work wonders. Constructive: With the choices, I wish there was more even-ness within it. Sometimes it feels pretty level whereas I get to make decent amounts of choices within a reasonable time, but there's moments where I feel like I'm going through dialogue a lot. Either way, it's great, but could benefit from some leveling out. Even small choices makes the player feel more... into the game, versus just reading. \n\n\nI suppose that's all of my notes! I loved the game. I can't wait for it to be finished and refined. I love it. And I want to get the previous game made by this company because I just loved this game and want to experience more of this wonderful and story-driven creativity.

From a future idea to add minigames into the story, countless choices that not only affect your relationship with the characters around you but also give you a number of funny results, and a focus on an intimate relationship with one Character instead of the usual multi-route Visual Novel.\n\nNow I'm not saying multiple routes is bad. Those are good, more replayability. But having a single route does give the team more ground to work with and focus on while moving the story forward and building up the world around it. You can play the first Episode via the Demo and, if you liked it, you can buy the Early Access version and continue in Episode 2.\n\nThe Characters within the game also feel alive and you can easily see character building as time goes on throughout the story. Bit by bit as you progress on your Journey with them, you learn more and more about them along with hints into their more private lives.\n\nNow it is Early Access and there is bound to be a few bugs and issues, or spelling mistakes, here and there. However given Early Access always means the current product is not the finishd product I can let these go. Honestly the only real mistakes I saw was an extra word or the movements of the Character models feeling a little fast. Of course half the time this was because I tabbed out and tabbed back into the game, so that is my fault.\n\nAnd if you like choices, boy oh boy will this game give you choices. Lots and lots of choices. More choices than you have save files. So it certainly builds up the possibility of multiple playthroughs, as you can change up your choices and see how it affects what the other characters think of you. Want to be Tsundere to a Pango? You can! You can be a nice guy or the guy that really just wants some tail. So to speak.\n\nI honestly can't wait to see the future episodes be added to the game over the year and I can't wait to see if the team also adds more to the game besides the episodes and future planned minigames. There IS an example of the minigames within the game right now in Episode 1 where you play a card game of Cheat with the other characters.

If this is a dealbreaker for you, then you should probably stop now, as they key point behind this setup was specifically to just do one relationship and give it a variety of options, which allows for the relationships to be significantly more complicated. So if you like Leanna, great! But it's always going to feel like the narrative is trying to push Leanna and the player-character together. The keyword here is \"reactivity\"!\n\nIn this case I'm mostly trusting the developer's words, since I haven't exactly tried multiple routes so far, but apparently the system is designed with a high degree of reactivity in mind, making it so that seemingly disparate random scenes can and will be used to influence future scenes. I don't actually have proof that this is happening, though there was one point where I was pleasantly surprised to find that a scene that I assumed was just a random one-off event... Actually led to another scene later on.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive thing though, is that they really do keep to the \"relationship simulator\" concept, and so far it's been pretty clear that they even adjust for the possibility that you just want to remain friends with Leanna. It's hard to say if things will remain that way, seeing as the game is still periodically pushing you to advance the relationship, but it still feels pretty natural to me, which seems to be their main goal: Making things feel natural.\n\nThe story itself is pretty standard isekai fare -- Which is to say, protagonist falls into fantasy world with no explanation and needs to find a way home while fighting evil shadow cultists, but let's be real: We're not here for the story, so much as the characters, all of which are overall pretty likeable. Obviously Leanna gets more attention than the rest (what with being the sole love interest), but all of them are enjoyable in their own ways and the free time events with them are still pretty satisfying.\n\nMy biggest complaint would probably be that Live2D does not mesh well with my relatively old computer, causing some pretty major lag during gameplay at times, which is always a pretty dangerous thing to have in a game consisting mostly of reading text.\n\nMy general assessment is that it's a hard sell if you're not interested in Leanna, but it's still worth at least checking out, since there does seem to be an impressive amount of reactivity and the relationship building (both platonic and romantic) is impressively natural, which admittedly is a hard thing to say in games.", "timestamp_created": 1501164912, "timestamp_updated": 1501164912, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717534", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33832627": {"recommendationid": "33832627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055809728", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1513947949}, "language": "english", "review": "PixelFade is back with their second Visual Novel and honestly it's the best Visual Novel currently on steam.

I RECOMMEND THIS GAME\n\nLong Review:\n\nThe first 2 episodes that are current out have been very interesting that is for sure, I gotta say I am impressed, it was way more than what I expected to say the least.\n\nOver a year ago I bought and played the Early Access of Ace Academy by Pixel Fade and I had to say I loved the way the voice acting was in English and actually sounded real. This time round the VA returned just as good as last time, though I am more partial to the Ace Academy Characters for my own reasons of liking (Cough) Gundam (Cough) Mecha games.\n\nBut I also like fantasy too and some of the choices of what you can say is hilarious that even make fun of you for choosing them. The characters overall are rather fun to interact with them and you even see different sides of them and some depth added as the story progresses. But of course you have to choose those options and that can mean that you will not be able to see all of a character unless you choose very carefully.\n\nThe Sound Track is rather nice and does not getting annoying as it can in other VN's which is a big plus in my book since it can be heard to read and listen to what a character is saying while the most annoying track is playing.\n\nI think though the think that stood out the most for me would have to be the way the characters base models are animated, THEY ARE ANIMATED, they have fluid movements, of their arms and when you leave just sit their and look you can see that they blink every now and again not to mention the fact that they BREATH, all characters if you just read the text and then don't click to continue are breathing in and out and whats more it looks rather realistic.\n\nThe Game is still in early access but I have to say I am looking forward to what is in store for us next.\n\nOverall I say buy this game it is worth the full retail price as it were but if you can get it on special good for you.", "timestamp_created": 1501149702, "timestamp_updated": 1501149702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33825541": {"recommendationid": "33825541", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988105353", "num_games_owned": 351, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501141064}, "language": "english", "review": "Crystalline, another visual novel created by our friends at PixelFade Inc. If you don't know, these guys are the same creators of Ace Academy. Since playing Ace Academy, I sincerely enjoyed that game and was excited that PixelFade was releasing another visual novel in a fantasy setting. I became a kickstarter backer and was given access to the demo for this game really early on. This review will be edited as time goes on because this game is in early access as of now.\n\nPROS\n\n- Voice acting: The cast that is presented in this game (so far) has had an impressive showing in the game. They make it feel believable and real. You can truly appreciate the hard work that the cast has put into these characters. Although it is in English, it sets a high standard for visual novels that has English voice acting.\n- Visuals: The visuals in this game are absolutely stunning. The demo that us kickstarter backers got transitioned well into the early access state that it is currently in. Everything was as stunning as I remembered. Being in a fantasy setting, colors and items are important, I feel like the CGI in this game definitely gives a good feeling of being in a fantasy world.\n- Animation: On top of the game having great visuals, we have amazing animation to add to the mix. The characters emote their feelings and actually correspond with the dialogue that is written in the storybox. With the LIVE2D technology, this feature certainly makes the characters feel and look real. Things like nodding their heads and having the girls chest jiggle up and down adds to realism. Long explanation short, boobie physics are great :)\n- Choices/relationship system: I haven't fully explored the game yet, but from the 3+ hours I spent with the demo and the short amount of time I spent on the early access, the choices are still plentiful and have an impact on the story. There hasn't really been anything major yet, but we will see in the future. There is a intricate relationship system being introduced into the game so I'm excited to see how that plays out instead of playing the game again for a different route for a particular girl. \n- Characters: These characters make the game that more interesting. We don't know that much about the main protagonist yet, but the supporting cast around him makes it up by offering fun dialogue and choices for you to read through. I am certain people will grow to love this game for the fun characters they will meet ont heir journey!\n\nThings you may have to worry about\n\n- Episodic: This game comes in episodes. The demo was chapter 1 and now with the game in early access, we have a chapter 2. If you are the type of person who cannot wait for episodic things, I suggest waiting until this game fully comes out.\n- Story: This game is still in development, the story hasn't been fleshed out yet so you will be going in blind. Time will tell how the story will unfold as development continues for this game. \n- Romance: There is only one romantic partner in this game from what I've read in the discussions. PixelFade has decided to focus on the dept of a relationship rather than go for multiple routes. I think it will be interesting to play, but we'll have to wait and see how it progresses.\n- Mini-games: There are mini-games for certain scenarios. The game isn't fully finished yet, so you will have to wait in order to play the game the way it was meant to be played.\n\nOverall thoughts\n\nI really haven't said anything negative yet about this game. I feel like this game will become a gem in the visual novel scene if given the right support and love. Please, check out this game if you're up for a visual novel with romance, comedy, action, and RPG elements thrown in the mix.", "timestamp_created": 1501137550, "timestamp_updated": 1501151393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616224", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33825164": {"recommendationid": "33825164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072297449", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512534429}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome Visual Novel.

I don't regret supporting these guys on patreon, nor their kickstarter for their latest game.  Of the parts I've played, the game has given me nothing but joy.  And EVN to set the standard in my opinion.  \n\nKiller voice cast, I mean there's Amanda Lee, and NateWantsToBattle, Amber Lee Connors, and Natalie Hoover.  All great voice actors and fit their roles well\n\nLive2D: As far as I know, this is the first non Japanese game to use Live2D technology, and it's wonderful.  The animations give the characters so much life, and they feel so much more real.\n\nAs for the story, well it's still developing, but the world is fascinating, and they did a good job pushing the character development along.  Every character feels fresh and unique, and I want to hug all of them (Some for... Larger.. reasons than others)\n\nIf you're interested in trying out a VN, this is a good one to start with in my opinion, it's only the second one I've really played for an extended period of time, and it's incredible.", "timestamp_created": 1501130854, "timestamp_updated": 1501131004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.745688", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}}}

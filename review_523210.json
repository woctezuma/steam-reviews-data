And there only being 13 achievements being mostly straightforward and easy made the game feel a little bit rewarding for the most part.\n\nWhat I won't give the game props on, and my reason for making this review negative is that the game is nothing more than LGBT propaganda. \n\nSure, the character's bisexual; I can deal with that. Maybe all the pressure from naysayers drove them to commit suicide on their birthday and you find out the tragedy, but oh no it cannot be that simple at all. Nah, it's gotta be the great journey of a bisexual transgender person that comes from a \"close-minded\" family that's portrayed harshly because they won't live in the characters fantasy, so they run off to be at an LGBT center where they'll spend their days with likeminded individuals.\n\nHere's what I seriously disrespect about the main character: Their entire basis of what their family/friends will think is all built on assumptions. Not one person has openly bashed them being transgender/bisexual because they only tell one person about it. Yes, it can be scary coming out to everyone, but don't you think it's a little close-minded yourself to assume facts formed from your own opinions instead of actually discovering them directly? What if their family turned out to be understanding, despite what they feel? What if their friends were accepting because they love them for who they are, not what gender they are? This is never discovered because the character takes the extremist approach and assumes everyone will just shun them. I shun them for their own hypocrisy. They'd rather live a lie than be truthful to themselves and others. I thought they were wanting to show pride in who they were, but it's okay to lie to family/friends about who you are.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're into a well-made mystery game with obviously forced LGBT views, by all means play the game. Like I said at the beginning, I liked the games premise, but the story did not stand up to what it could've been.

Through text messages we can start this adventure, and easily find that something's up. The previous owner of this phone, by the name of Sam, seems to be missing, and it's up to you to find what happened, based on his digital actions in the last 2 months prior to his 18th birthday.\nI'd hate to spoil the game, so obviously I won't, but I really want to advise everyone to try this game, as it's impossible to stop, I guarantee you. First, because human curiosity has tremendous power, and also because half-way through the game you know what happened, but you still look for clues to unveil the final actions of this character.\nBrowsing through pictures, messages, and different apps such as dating, calendar, and even web browsing will make you feel a small-time detective. Although you are spying someone else's phone, doesn't feel bad, or good, it's just a race for answers. A development of clues that can be unlocked by thinking, following logic, and remember the most important thing you read or though to be important.\nUsing clues to discover passwords in order to unlock apps and advance onto the story was my favorite thing to do, and I'm sure you will enjoy it as well! But there's more... You can actually interact slightly with some contacts. You won't be making any special decision, but still... Actions are actions!\n\nUncovering Sam's secrets led me to learn a lot about something I wasn't completely aware of, it made me see things with a different perspective. For that, I am thankful.\nSome people have an easy life, others don't.

That said, the premise of the game and the control you have might sour some people, particularly those who get attached to characters and find themselves involved in the story. The game itself is about invading the privacy of someone who has many personal secrets and works to safeguard them, and at least one decision you can make (and will if you want an achievement) feels pretty sketchy.\n\nIf you don't mind the LGBT aspect or the arguable issues with privacy, A Normal Lost Phone is a fun way to pass the time.

Il piccolo team di Accidental Queens, proveniente dalla cittadina di Tourcoing, dopo l'ottima ricezione dell'esperimento, ha deciso di donare al titolo un supporto contenutistico pi\u00f9 informato, chiedendo consiglio e revisioni a varie associazioni addentro a problematiche LGBT+ (OUTrans, Centre LGBT de Touraine  ecc.). La lodevole seriet\u00e0 e integrit\u00e0 di intenti non si trasmette purtroppo nel prodotto finale, che si riduce, perlomeno nella mia esperienza, a importante fondatore di un vero e proprio nuovo filone videoludico, definito (senza troppa fantasia) in quel di RPS \"found phone\". Sebbene solitamente dia molta importanza all'abilit\u00e0 di un titolo di inserirsi in una temperie culturale riuscendo in qualche modo a farsi notare e a lasciare un precedente reinterpretabile, come videogiocatore-consumatore, non posso trascurare il fatto di aver passato la mia serata in compagnia di ANLP chiedendomi della leggerezza con cui alcune scelte di design sono state prese, e che hanno finito per rompere l'incanto di un concept cos\u00ec brillante. Partiamo da una valutazione di intenti: Accidental Queens ha esplicitamente creato una simulazione d'esperienza in cui il giocatore partecipa direttamente allo svolgersi della vicenda, senza avere una figura mediatrice (avatar o quant'altro). Sebbene il concept sia a oggi non pi\u00f9 freschissimo (senza ricadere nel solito 199X o in AC Unity, esempi pi\u00f9 pertinenti sono forse esperimenti con altre interfacce quotidiane, come Her Story o Cibele), \u00e8 l'intermediario proposto, il cuore del gameplay, a essere in qualche modo rivoluzionario: ci affideremo dunque al nostro Weltwissen riguardante il mondo degli smartphone per avere una guida su come procedere nella narrazione, mentre nessuno ci spiegher\u00e0 esplicitamente che per accedere ad una app serve una password, cos\u00ec come che per accedere a internet serve una qualche forma di wifi. Entusiasta di trovarmi nella posizione proposta, ho cercato al principio, sulla scia dell'iniziale input in cui viene specificato il nostro ruolo nella vicenda, di immedisimarmi nello strano ruolo indicatomi. Al primo enigma incontrato (la password dello wifi, appunto), ho raccolto l'indizio del CAP della cittadina pensando di esser chiamato ad agire come davanti un AR game: in poche parole, ho digitato su un motore di ricerca le informazioni di cui avevo bisogno, pensando di dover ricostruire in qualche modo l'equivalente (americano?) di un codice di avviamento postale di una qualche localit\u00e0 minore. Il risultato \u00e8 stato a dir poco punitivo: le prime voci rimandavano a soluzioni del gioco, e alla costatazione che la struttura di ANLP, nonostante sia pensata fin dalle interazioni di base per \"bucare lo schermo\", \u00e8 circolare e autoconclusiva. Poco male, mi sono detto, limitiamo la nostra partecipazione attiva e concentriamoci sul ruolo attribuitoci cos\u00ec come lo interpreta il gioco. Questa seconda consapevolezza non ha aiutato affatto. Il giocatore infatti scompare letteralmente dagli orizzonti di ANLP per l'intera durata dell'esperienza, soltanto per ricomparire timidamente nelle ultime battute nella forma di un consiglio su come far apparire i titoli di coda. L'interfaccia dello smartphone si \u00e8 subito trasfigurata in una zavorra limitante: non avevo pi\u00f9 un dispositivo di qualcun altro in mano, ma stavo semplicemente sfogliando pagine di testo ordinate in dei blocchi di formato chiusi e non comunicanti (leggo che questo aspetto \u00e8 stato notevolmente migliorato in uno pseudo-sequel gi\u00e0 disponibile su questa piattaforma; inoltre, suppongo che l'acquisto della versione android aiuti molto in questo senso). Ancora una volta, non \u00e8 stato questo l'apice del mio disappunto. Se qualcosa ha del contenuto significativo, anche se presentato in maniera maldestra, posso ritenermi soddisfatto. Anche sotto questo aspetto, per\u00f2, ho riscontrato seri problemi. Accidental Queens ha esplicitamente dichiarato che ANLP \u00e8 stato concepito con una struttura progressiva ma dall'ordine interno ai vari blocchi relativamente libero al fine di catturare l'interesse del lettore prima ancora che possa valutare con il proprio bagaglio esperienziale e ideologico le tematiche proposte. Mano a mano che la consapevolezza emerge, aumenta anche il carico informativo proposto, barcamenandosi con ovvia difficolt\u00e0 tra contesto narrativo e intento moraleggiante. Anche qui, sulla carta, l'idea \u00e8 decisamente brillante. Peccato che ANLP continui a essere concentrato troppo su se stesso, dimenticandosi del bagaglio medio di chi si trovi a consumarlo su una piattaforma come Steam. Ora, di titoli dedicati a problematiche LGBT+, anche di notevole successo (vedi Gone Home), ormai cominciano a essercene in discreta quantit\u00e0. ANLP non aiuta quando non nasconde a un primo distratto browsing delle interfacce la dualit\u00e0 degli account del protagonista sulla app di appuntamenti, distruggendo all'istante il bel proposito della simultaneit\u00e0 tra presa di coscienza graduale e livello di contenuto. A proposito di questo, sono sorpreso di come si sia parlato pi\u00f9 di ambiguit\u00e0 di intenti moraleggianti e non di ambiguit\u00e0 tra intenti descrittivi e informativi. Mi spiego: ANLP, se preso informativamente, \u00e8 interessante quanto il browsing di forum scritti da ragazzini di et\u00e0 delle superiori. Consigli medici anche di un certo peso sono sciorinati con una leggerezza sconcertante, e la psicologia da \"pacca sulla spalla\" \u00e8 sempre dietro l'angolo di ogni post. Ma, del resto, ANLP E' composto di forum scritti da ragazzini di et\u00e0 delle superiori (livello descrittivo), In quel senso per\u00f2, la scelta delle tematiche \u00e8 perlomeno discutibile, visto che la maggior parte delle discussioni sono incentrate sugli aspetti esterni, sociali della problematica (che, come appena detto, sono meglio conoscibili tramite altri canali) e non su quelli interni, personali, intimi. Cade cos\u00ec anche la possibilit\u00e0 di empatizzare con il protagonista, che diventa sfondo di un copione anonimo, gi\u00e0 visto. Non mi soffermo per problemi di spazio sulla molto dibattuta problematica etica dell'invio a terzi di materiale sensibile. ANLP, al di l\u00e0 degli aspetti controversi, \u00e8 un prototipo troppo grezzo per essere godibile nel 2018.

No final das contas a maioria das mensagens s\u00e3o conversa fiada e praticamente tudo gira ao redor de um \u00fanico assunto e mist\u00e9rio do jogo. O assunto em s\u00ed embora interessante de ver em um jogo tamb\u00e9m deixa um pouco a desejar- entre sacar e encontrar os desfechos podia ter tocado em tantas coisas mais mas a oportunidade n\u00e3o \u00e9 aproveitada. Mas o final at\u00e9 achei interessante, diferente do que esperaria. D\u00e1 para a imaginar uma cena com 'the end' muito claramente ali\u00e1s.\n\nS\u00f3 \u00e9 uma pena que metade da gra\u00e7a se perde no steam.

(Even though I, myself, am not a big fan of smartphones). The game discusses identity not just [spoiler] gender identity [/spoiler], but also identity in general. The game does have it's flaws though, although some of the flaws depend mostly on the player's taste in games.\n\nThe whole smartphone aspect of it is one that brings it a lot of charm. This makes the game more intimate, and more personal. This personal aspect to the game is to make the protagonist more sympathetic, and the whole point of the phone style. Having to figure out someone's passwords through understanding what they find the most important to themselves, listening to music that they made, and music that they enjoy, seeing the pictures on their phone, their private text messages, etc. these all create a sense of intimacy between the player and the protagonist. The person who has 'found' the missing phone, the one you are controlling is an empty vessel for you to insert yourself into, and the protagonist is out of your control, which can be very rare for a video game, especially a visual novel, where the protagonist's choices are made by you. But in this you can only make the choices that come in the aftermath of all the guts of the game. \n\nA game that makes you experience the aftermath of the events, reminds you that you are not always the important one in the story, that other people have stories. Having to accept that your identity doesn't hinge around being the centre of attention, as it usually does in video games, can really put in perspective your impact on the world. Exploring the identity of the player, you. The identity of the player is more vague than the protagonist, in the end this game forces you to be yourself, instead of the protagonist. That is the main core of this game, being yourself. And the identity of the player is defined by being untouched, and unexplained. Sometimes people can be more interested in someone else's lives than their own, people can care about other people's lives than their own. [spoiler] The concept of gender identity is explored in-depth in this game, and is an essential tool in educating people on transgender and non-binary identities. With the game having the protagonist being a transwoman, who visits an LGBT+ forum, it provides quite an accurate experience that many trans people go through in learning about themselves, especially if they live in a bigoted area, where the internet is the only source of education and socialising that they have access to. Some may say that the forum dialogue is written in a very robotic or cold way, but as someone who has seen these types of forums, they tend to be a lot more educational than you would expect, and educational doesn't always mean boring. As well as educating the player, the game also gives hope to any LGBT+ youth out there who are stuck in a small town, with the protagonist eventually escaping from their town and living amoung more like minded people.[/spoiler]\n\nThere could potentially be more flaws than I will mention, no game is perfect. This game has gotten criticism that it is written a bit too cold or unemotional, but within context, this can be explained, and only a part of the game can be said to be close to that. People have said that this game has bad grammar or a lot of mistakes in the dialogue, but another thing to remember is this game was translated, and a game's value should not be judged by spelling mistakes. A big flaw that I found is that the achievements were completely bugged for me! I had to do a second playthrough to get any of the achievements to work, but they do work after a second playthrough. I am unaware if the achievements are still bugged, because I can't test that, but be reassured that I was able to get them after another playthrough.\n\nOn the whole, this game is really worth getting. For some people it may not be their cup of tea, but it's a cup of tea that is important to drink, a cup of tea that is filled with important education, and great mysterious story, and great music! Even if you aren't a fan of the smartphone layout, I am really not either, this game can still be so enjoyable!

Not even slightly emotionally engaging, although I'm supposed to understand what the protagonist is feeling because I used to have similar issues. Other than that, I personally think that a protagonist was behaving very selfish, but as the game progresses, you are kinda forced to sympathize him, and this forcing is even put into words -- when you have to do a certain action in order to finish the game (it is said that it is \"the right thing to do\"!!).\nWell, I don't think it was a right thing to do, not at all.\nI am so angry about being forced to sympathize an egoistic and cowardly teenager who thinks that he is more special than the others and therefore ignores their feelings that I won't recommend this game to anyone.

Mi\u0119dzy innymi to, \u017ce ucz\u0119szcza\u0142 na spotkania klubu ksi\u0105\u017ckowego i klubu mi\u0142o\u015bnik\u00f3w gier, ale najbardziej spe\u0142nia\u0142 si\u0119 w graniu na harfie oraz komponowaniu muzyki. Mia\u0142 kochaj\u0105c\u0105 rodzin\u0119, sporo znajomych oraz chodzi\u0142 z niejak\u0105 Meliss\u0105. Z kolei Melissa, artystycznie utalentowana dziewczyna o gor\u0105cym temperamencie, cz\u0119sto dawa\u0142a swojej sympatii sygna\u0142y, \u017ce jest zazdrosna o Alice, przyjaci\u00f3\u0142k\u0119 Sama z ko\u0142a gier. Pojawia si\u0119 wi\u0119c pytanie, czy to nowo kie\u0142kuj\u0105ce uczucie sprawi\u0142o, \u017ce sytuacja pary uleg\u0142a znacznemu pogorszeniu tu\u017c pod koniec roku? I kto kogo skrzywdzi\u0142 bardziej? Drugim wa\u017cnym krokiem jest w\u0142\u0105czenie wi-fi. Pod\u0142\u0105czenie telefonu do sieci publicznej wymaga znajomo\u015bci has\u0142a, a je trzeba samodzielnie odkry\u0107. Nie jest to rzecz podana na tacy, ale \u0142atwo si\u0119 na ni\u0105 natkn\u0105\u0107, w odr\u00f3\u017cnieniu od reszty zabezpiecze\u0144. Internet pozwoli graczowi na kolejne do\u015bwiadczenie strz\u0119pk\u00f3w \u017cycia Sama. Najpierw polecam przeczyta\u0107 e-maile, mi\u0119dzy innymi te od Alice i Melissy, a tak\u017ce wiadomo\u015bci powi\u0105zane z za\u0142o\u017ceniem kont na portalu randkowym, oko\u0142o dwa tygodnie po wymianie antypatycznych SMS-\u00f3w z Meliss\u0105. Intryguj\u0105ce jest to, \u017ce Sam mia\u0142 kaprys na uzupe\u0142nienie dw\u00f3ch profili pod nieco r\u00f3\u017cni\u0105cymi si\u0119 od siebie nazwami. Do tego pierwszego znacznie \u0142atwiej si\u0119 dosta\u0107, ale to dost\u0119p do drugiego daje znacz\u0105c\u0105 wskaz\u00f3wk\u0119 i wskazuje kierunek ku rozwik\u0142aniu sekretu ch\u0142opaka. Przede wszystkim jest na nim wi\u0119cej rozm\u00f3w i jedna z nich prowadzi do pewnego forum internetowego, a stamt\u0105d trafia si\u0119 do nast\u0119pnego miejsca ukrytego w telefonie. Gracze mog\u0105 liczy\u0107 na spor\u0105 dawk\u0119 czytania oraz emocji. Samo zako\u0144czenie historii pozostawia pewien niedosyt, natomiast podoba\u0142o mi si\u0119 to, \u017ce nie by\u0142o ono przewidywalne. W kt\u00f3rym\u015b momencie mia\u0142am w g\u0142owie kilka r\u00f3\u017cnych scenariuszy i \u017caden nie by\u0142 bliski temu, co wydarzy\u0142o si\u0119 naprawd\u0119, a za to nale\u017c\u0105 si\u0119 Accidental Queens gratulacje.\n\nA Normal Lost Phone dotyka w du\u017cej mierze [spoiler]odrzucania przez spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwo ludzi zwi\u0105zanych z ruchem LGBT[/spoiler], a przy tym jest niesamowicie klimatycznie napisana i zrealizowana pod k\u0105tem wizualnym. Tw\u00f3rcy podj\u0119li tematy dojrzewania, odkrywania w\u0142asnych pragnie\u0144 i poznawania si\u0119 z lud\u017ami. W tyle nie pozostaj\u0105 codzienne sprawy, tj. relacje z nie do ko\u0144ca rozumiej\u0105cymi w\u0142asne dzieci rodzicami, pierwsze powa\u017cne mi\u0142o\u015bci i przyja\u017anie. Postacie przewijaj\u0105ce si\u0119 na ekranie s\u0105 r\u00f3\u017cnorodne i wydaj\u0105 si\u0119 namacalne, a nie bez polotu czy papierowe.

While it explores a deeply personal story through the unique plot device that is a lost and unlocked smartphone (a bit unbelievable), it basically amounts to a journey of acceptance and how much of that will strike a chord with you will depend on how easily you are able to relate to others by putting yourself in their shoes. While I could certainly empathize with the owner of the phone and his trials and tribulations (unlocked through mail, messages and other applications loaded onto the phone) there was always a degree of uncomfortability to each discovery as my voyeurism got the better of me in the name of narrative game design. Surely, the majority would have simply searched the settings menu or contacts in order to call someone from the owners contacts list and tell them about the discovery of the phone instead of snooping through their personal life?

Find out the truth.\u201d[/h1]\n\nA Normal Lost Phone is a short game with an interesting story, the phone interface is merely a tool for the story to unfold. At first glance, it might look just like any other mystery-based game and appears very predictable. But the more you read and explore, the more you realize that the actual story has nothing to do with what you could have imagined.\n\nAs a very curious person, I had no trouble digging into someone else\u2019s life, I was eager to click on all the app icons and read everything I could about the different characters and their personalities. The little riddles that must be solved in order to unlock new apps and the rest of the story required a little digging, but were easy enough in the end. If you read everything, even what looks like it has no use in the story, you\u2019ll have no problem solving them.\n\nThe story itself is very gripping, I personally never had to deal with the issues the main character, Sam, is confronted with, but the way this sometimes-controversial subject was introduced was really smooth.

You start digging around and looking at its contents. Many elements were thoughtfully designed, such as having to find the WiFi password so you can access more information on the phone. There's not much more I can detail, but you soon start to sleuth around for additional user passwords and piece together what happened. \n\nWith every additional account I unlocked and read (email, online profile etc.) I really started to worry for the previous owner of the phone and wanted to find out what happened.\n\n[h1]Additional thoughts[/h1]\nIt should be evident enough but \"gameplay\" only consists of clicking and reading. Definitely expect this to be a story-centric experience rather than a gameplay heavy one. I won't mention anything about the story - all I can say is let the phone take you along on the ride!\n\nThis game did a good job of immersing the player, and made me reflect on how our phones can reveal so much about ourselves.

It\u2019s short, simple, and easy to follow/understand, however you don\u2019t really get involved with it as much as you do with other games.\n\n[h1] INTRO [/h1]\nIn all honesty, I didn\u2019t care much for this game. The design was simple, the playthrough was easy to follow and quite dull, and the only real reason I think someone would get this game (aside from the fact it has a LGBT+ theme/coming out story) would be because the achievements are stupidly easy to get. By all means, it has some good points with it, like the fact the art is actually neat to look at and apparently the music sounds good (of which I didn\u2019t listen to until I saw others doing so in the Community screenshots). The idea behind it is neat, however there are cons to these pros that I feel outweigh them in design of a game worth enjoying.\n\n[h1] PRO LIST [/h1]\n1. The art is rather decent and looks nice. It happens to blur a lot of faces that otherwise don\u2019t have a focus in the story (neat touch) and you can see that different pictures are colored differently to reflect mood (the pictures of the phone owner feeling \u201ctrapped\u201d are dark compared to pictures of the owner\u2019s true expressions ringing out which are lighter/brighter in color.\n2. The messages in the phone are easy to read and they added a neat feature that allows you to quickly scroll to the top of a conversation with a button press instead of scrolling your mouse wheel. It\u2019s convenient and comes with an achievement!\n3. It\u2019s short, simple, and requires little thought to figure out the \u201cpuzzles\u201d and \u201cchallenges provided.\n\n[h1] CON LIST [/h1]\n\n1. The game and community behind it are LGBT+ based and directed to that niche market, and as such, those who are against or would rather not deal with LGBT+ bullshit often skip over the game or return it after figuring out its origins. \n2. The game is so simple and easy to play (with such little content) that when you sit and read through every text message and complete the game, you only sat there for 1 hour. If you want the achievements (as all it\u2019s really useful for is adding another \u201cperfect game\u201d to your Steam list and returning it for your money back) it takes at most 15 mins. I only have 2 hours on the game because I left halfway through to eat.\n3. This is suppose to be a storytelling game where you, as the person who picked up the phone and looked through it, has to snoop around and picks up clues to figure out the owner. Find the story, follow it, and see it\u2019s conclusion. The Steam Store page for it makes it sound 10x more interesting than it really is. The story is flat, uninteresting, hard to get involved and otherwise placid and deadpan. When i play games, no matter what one, I try to take on the personality of the character I have before me (and God help me when I have to make my own and choose traits/class/race and such). With this, the whole premise is YOU found the phone and MUST look through it. I couldn\u2019t get into that because I wouldn\u2019t do that, so when playing, i tried to adopt a mentality that would make me want to play the game as realistically as I could. So I wiped the memory and left it behind, and got an achievement. \n\n[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1]\nIn all honesty, if you are into a game that is short, simple, unemotional and you don\u2019t want to get attached to characters, then yeah, this game is for you. Achievement hunting is more like buying the dead animal from the butcher rather than hunting it. No challenge, easy, quick, and a helluva lot quicker. The LGBT+ gaming industry is something that could be explored in modest ways. Characters people can get attached to who aren\u2019t heterosexual, but it effects a scene not the story are good places to start (see Dragon Age 2 and Dragon Age: Inquisition for more information on how a game can have LGBT+ elements with the same issues and challenges other identifying genders/sexualities face without it being the focus of the game).\n\nIt\u2019s almost sad I give a game focused on the issue of transgender rights and trans-phobia a \u201cNot Recommended\u201d review, but you don\u2019t pay more for the whitewash on a canvas that will be painted over by something even better in due time.", "timestamp_created": 1506977945, "timestamp_updated": 1506977945, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474658", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35414717": {"recommendationid": "35414717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314312887", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506949422}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is simple, intriquing, and although it's a bit short it's completely worth the experience.", "timestamp_created": 1506949728, "timestamp_updated": 1506949728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35404010": {"recommendationid": "35404010", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013806302", "num_games_owned": 2359, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506916856}, "language": "english", "review": "A short but interesting idea exploring taboo subjects that should not be anymore in 2017. \nThe game use your ability to mine data into puzzles to unlock more data and more story.\nIt starts like a normal lost phone but, while exploring the privacy of the owner, you slowly understand why it was.\nThe last puzzle actually explain everything if you were still unsure, nothing is left open.

The story kept me going, the simulated OS made sense and there are very few reasons for me to criticise it. But there is one. The LGBT aspects of the game removed from the experience. I was quite happy with it until things started with that. When I first saw the fact that Sam was bisexual, I thought, \"That's cool. It's nice to have details like that.\"\n\nLittle did I know, that's the entire reason for the game existing. The excessive homophobia and coincidences with other LGBT people felt excessive and the interpretations I had initially made didn't match up with what was being told to me. It felt like writing a story and someone was ripping out the pages as I wrote it.

I think it ruined a little bit of the experience and the \"unexpected\" factor that every narrative tries to construct. If I'd discover who Sam was without these warning, I think I would've liked the game more.\n\n- The soundtrack is perfect! Many, many times, while I was reading the game's texts, I felt like the songs were following their rhythm, and I felt the ups and downs just like the character would - it's amazing.\n\n- I may have overplayed it. I read absolutely every text, e-mail, everything I found, because I thought they were so important to the plot... But it turns out that I didn't need to!

This really is just a primer. It's not emotionally resonant, and the writing is workmanlike at best.\n\nI don't know who this game is for. It's certainly not for genderqueer people, who can find lots of safe online spaces to hold actual conversations, rather than infodump faux forum posts. And it's not for homophobes, because there's nothing compelling enough to make someone reconsider their assumptions once it becomes clear what's going on. I guess it could be worthwhile for an ignorant potential ally, as none of the information is bad or misguided. But it feels like an edugame, and in the absence of relationships with gender nonconforming people, I'd point these people to books, or real forums, or... I don't know... maybe tumblr? OK, probably not tumblr. But there are a ton of resources out there for the curious. \n\nAnd one day, if people really need to learn about this stuff from video games, I'll be able to point them to one that has more going on under the hood, that is emotionally powerful and not just didactic.

The goal is to form a personal connection with Sam as you discover the truth, something that some can relate to while others can learn from another perspective. However, they do this in such a clunky way I think the message gets loss in a sea of one part \"trying WAY too hard\" and one part \"Way too idealistic.\" \n\nCool concept, art is okay (Some of the people aren't drawn super well but it's not terrible), music got dull kinda quickly for me, but I mostly just wish if they were going to go with this type of topic that they handled it in a different way. A difficult subject should be difficult to navigate through and I know some people were kind of offended by certain aspects of it (Such as the ability to send the wrong photo to Phil. I'll keep it vague to avoid full spoilers here but those who played it already will know what I mean. You either need to give players the option to go 100% terrible wih their actions (Such as an ability to interact with Sam's family after discoveries are made) Or keep it linear with only one correct answer to the puzzles (and thus, no ability to send the wrong one). \n\nI think the happy ending for Sam was  the worst part of it for me and is what i mean when I say it's too idealistic. Yeah in a perfect world someone like Sam would be able to just head out and leave their phone behind but in the real world I really don't think things would turn out so happy for Sam. \n\n\nIf you took Emily is Away (especially the sequel's length) and combined that with this game, I think it would've been a little more successful, with a \"good\" ending and a \"bad\" ending to add a little level of realism and make it feel more like we had a litle control in Sam's life (Since we kinda already do since you can finish a couple drafts he left unfinished). \n\n\nUltimately not being able to interact with any of his contacts was a bumer for me. What's the first thing anyone would o with a lost phone? Try to contact someone in the contacts and be all \"I got your phone, yo.\" \n\nIt's just missing too much for me to want to reccommend it.

It is slow paced and pretty casual with a few simple puzzles to complete in order to progress and access everything (these mainly involve figuring out passwords). Overall, it is nicely made, the controls are simple and it runs smoothly. The game addresses LGBT issues and does this well, for the most part; I liked the protagonist and the story and enjoyed my 80 minutes of playtime. Commendably, \u2018A Normal Lost Phone\u2019 uses its narrative to highlight and explore real obstacles faced by people in the LGBT community whilst also being very informative.\n\nHaving said that, I also there was a lot of scope for this game to be improved. The main character and story were good but minimal and I think it could have been expanded upon to build an even more emotive experience and a better connection to Sam. Also, whilst there is a wealth of great information in the game but this feels a bit forced and actually makes up a significant portion of the game, giving it a vaguely preachy feel which I think could have been overcome with further development of the main character and a better understanding of the back story and supporting characters. I found myself thinking quite regularly that there was room for things to be unpacked and it sometimes felt as if the game was built under very strict time and budgetary constraints (I understand this if it is the case!).\n\nThe game is only a couple of quid; it's a good experience and worth the money, but I'd have preferred to pay more for more game. I guess if my main critique is that there wasn't enough of it then it certainly can't be that bad and I recommend it happily.\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this and would like to see my game reviews (and a bunch of other ramblings) in their natural habitat please visit my [url=www.rachaelbreartonwrites.com]blog[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1501481943, "timestamp_updated": 1511252954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509185", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33911827": {"recommendationid": "33911827", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001608418", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1521493702}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Muito bom Recomendo demais!!!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1501441852, "timestamp_updated": 1501441852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33900272": {"recommendationid": "33900272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042131689", "num_games_owned": 449, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501379334}, "language": "english", "review": "Hands down one of the best games I've ever played.\nThe game is more of a learning experience, an ethical approach into a very complicated and to many people very alien topic.\nThe presentation of said topic is top notch, very creative and thoughtful game design.\nI had a blast with it and obviously finished it in one setting!\n\nIt is wayy too cheap aswell, the game exists more to educate people and less to get money into the devs pockets.\nBuy it!", "timestamp_created": 1501405403, "timestamp_updated": 1501405403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33895680": {"recommendationid": "33895680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201106769", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501384113}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved the music, and I was pleasantly surprised by the story!

Lots of attention was given to the details and kudos are deserved.\n-Also, the overall message is a positive one.\n\nNow for the bad:\n-You'll probably know what's going on pretty quickly, and from that point the story drags because now you're just waiting to get to the end. \n-The puzzles are ridiculously easy. I had the WiFi and first Luv account open before I even got to their in game hints.\n-This is more of a political message than a game. It's more story than interactive piece of art. I don't really mind that, but some might.\n-I actually think the advice you read towards the end is pretty hypocritical. It's, literally, encouraging the same behavior it condemned throughout the rest of the story. \n\nIf you're looking for a traditional game, this isn't for you. If you're looking for a nice, short, lightly interactive story and don't mind the content, which you can see in most of the other reviews (I avoided the spoiler), give it a shot.

I am incredibly cynical though, so I find the whole thing cheesy and unrealistic. I support the game's message, I just think that it's not realistic. For one, who in their right mind would snoop through someone's phone? You either steal it, or try to find out who owns it and give it back. You don't need to snoop through the private messages. \n\nAlso, while the format of the game is a very good idea, the story is bland. Once you know what's really going on, there's still half the game left. And it doesn't make a good impact. A game that did this sort of thing better is Emily is Away. And the second one, too. Both of those games were based around an early 2000s message board. So it's a similar idea. But both games have an impact. The story is heartbreaking. This, this is just bland. You sort of go around and learn about the person. Nothing sad happens. Nothing happy happens. It's just boring.\n\nAnd Sam is a very unrealistic character. He(or she, I don't want to bother confusing myself with the pronouns) doesn't act like a real person. Throughout the whole game, I never thought that I was seeing a real person. I just saw a game. I saw a game with text messages, not a real person's phone. Sam isn't relateable, or interesting. Just simple. When most people aren't simple.\n\n It wasn't immersive, it wasn't emotional, it was just a PSA. That's all it was. It wasn't really a game, as you don't make any choices(not really).\n\nI reccomend that you don't get this game, but that's from my point of view. I can see how many people would enjoy this game.

There are a LOT more details and nuance added about Sam's life, more conversations and more unlockable content (iirc - I played the old version more than a year ago :D) The visual style is still pleasant and functional. I liked the new \"photos\" too :)\n\nThe only thing I didn't particularly care for were the default music tracks, I ended up just turning off the music player for most of my playthrough, but that's just my personal taste. On the other hand I liked Sam's compositions with the harp.\n\nI liked the puzzles, though I had to use the hint guide for some of them :D They tie really nicely into Sam's characterisation.\n\nA little downside of the many added discussions is that gameplay-wise in the original version it was easier to tell which conversation were meaningful, as most of the filler ones were just 1-2 messages as far as I remember. In this new version even some of those are fleshed out, which is a good point for realism, but made it a bit more difficult to piece together which are the important people and conversations.\n\nSpoilers ahead:\n\n[spoiler]In the original web version Sam's decision to run away felt a bit harsh on her parents, as we haven't seen much of her family's queerphobia. I'm glad they added the new details in this version, her decision feels a lot more sound this way.[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]The new forum boards are basically just a big trans 101, which is probably informative for the vast majority of players, but as a trans person it felt somewhat boring, I've read so many similar conversations before :D[/spoiler]\n\nOverall excellent job devs, keep up the good work \ud83d\ude18\n\n[h1]Recommended[/h1]\nif you like puzzle-adventure games with a strong focus on non-linear storytelling (in the vein of Gone Home and Her Story), and if you don't mind the existence of queer people :P\n\n[i]Thanks to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041921427]Kittendumpling[/url] for the game! <3[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1500580648, "timestamp_updated": 1500581858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537768", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33675263": {"recommendationid": "33675263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085734035", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500566553}, "language": "english", "review": "Let's make meaning in a story through making the main character a bi black trans character! nice...\nI feel the premise of this game is great and the way it works.

The mechanics, puzzles, and overall presentation of the game (including its soundtrack) are all smooth and polished. But it's the story that's the focus here. You find a stranger's phone abandoned and, through reading messages and emails, and working out various passwords from wifi to dating apps, piece together the story of the phone's owner. It's ingenious and simple, the progression and puzzles are easy to follow while being engaging, and the plot is intriguing from the start.\n\nWhere this game really shines, though, is in how personal it is. Its focus is on LGBTQ+ issues and experiences, and it really rang true for me. As I found out more and more about the owner of the phone I found myself becoming more and more proud of them and their bravery in discovering and exploring who they are in a homophobic area.\n\nI feel there should be some warnings attached, though. As the game tells you in its opening screen, there are themes of homophobia and transphobia, a bigoted family, and a mention of suicide. It's certainly a bittersweet game that doesn't sugarcoat the sometimes harsh realities of being LGBTQ+. For anyone who (like me) goes into this game worried it's going to be another instance of 'bury your gays', here's a (vague) spoiler: [spoiler] nobody dies, no one is abused or kicked out, and the owner of the phone ends up happier than they were. And we, the player, arguably help them.

You read through the previous owner's chat logs, email, and forum accounts, and step by step uncover a touching and (at times) dramatic story.\n\nSince the story is told via chat, email, or forum post exchange with many different people, the game can present many different perspectives. This approach also gave the developers the opportunity to include some background information which might actually be valuable for real people in a similar situation as the (fictitious) phone owner.\n\nWhile the story is realistic, believable, and touches important topics, it unfortunately was not as engaging for me as it could have been. There are several reasons for that:\n\n1. Snooping around in another person's private life, especially when this person is clearly going through a difficult time, is a pretty crappy thing to do - but the game simply assumes that I would. I would have appreciated if it had given me any justification for such an act. Since it does not, I felt fairly uncomfortable while playing, and this probably kept me from establishing any actual emotional bonds to the characters. After I discovered the address of the previous owner (which happens quite early), I felt that what I was doing was clearly wrong, and not something that a decent person would or should do - yet, the only way to progress in the game was to keep doing it.\n\n2. The conversations and texts in the game feel very realistic, but unfortunately that also makes them rather bland. As with a real found phone, most of the messages aren't actually worth reading, they are matter-of-factly conversations about things like \"I missed class, what did the teacher talk about?\". From the perspective of a player who wants to experience interesting dialogue, I found the writing disappointingly dull, though I recognize that the writers went for realism over style, which I can understand. Nevertheless, there _are_ games that manage to provide both, \"A Normal Lost Phone\" unfortunately just isn't one of them. The story itself also feels very \"typical\", and many of the characters lack nuance. It's a story that I've seen or heard many times by now, and I couldn't find any new elements in it that would have made it feel fresh, but again - the developer's goal clearly _was_ to tell an everyday story without embellishments.\n\n3. The story progresses in a linear fashion. While you can freely explore the apps on the phone, the way how further information is unlocked is completely on rails. Since I also did not have any meaningful choices to make, playing the game was much less engaging for me than it could have been.\n\nThe game includes a few puzzles to solve, mainly these consist of guessing a password based on background information provided. It is fairly easy to find the respective information, though it can be difficult to find the \"correct\" way how to derive the exact passcode from this information.\n\nRegardless of all this criticism, though, the fact remains that this game deals with an important, delicate topic in a very responsible, thoughtful, mature, and even potentially helpful way. And it tells a story which, despite the issues I listed above, I definitely can't rate as \"bad\" either.\n\nIt is very hard for me to rate this game. In fact I would have appreciated an option to post this review without a rating. I think the story may have a strong positive impact on players in a similar situation as the phone owner, or players who don't know much about the topic, but are open-minded enough to explore the associated feelings and educate themselves on the background information that the game provides. Hence the game gets my recommendation, even though it was more of a \"meh\" experience for me personally.\n\nI believe that the complete lack of a justification for the snooping-around required me to distance myself from the game in order to play it, and that distance worked against the emotional bond that the game probably wants to create. But I have a feeling that my reaction in this regard may be unusually strong, and other players may not feel as strongly about invading the privacy of a fictional person, so I did not let this influence my rating.", "timestamp_created": 1499171801, "timestamp_updated": 1499172239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533529", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33218996": {"recommendationid": "33218996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059301518", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499152653}, "language": "english", "review": "The only complaint I have about this game is [spoiler]You can send the draft email after the end-game email and it's the same response no matter what.

The music and general sound design is nice as well, and totally fits as music that you can just have on in the background while learning about the main character, Sam. The art style and colouring of the game and the art is beautiful as well, and so easy on the eyes, I almost want the whole world to look like this game.\nWhile I played it in just over an hour, I imagine if you took time to read through everything carefully it would maybe take an hour and half, maybe two, so based on the logic of an hour of gameplay for every pound (I think that's a thing people do?), it's pretty good value, even if it is short and not at all complicated.\nSpeaking of complicated, the 'puzzles' are fairly easy as if you read carefully enough, they basically tell you what the answer is, except for one that might trip you up a little if you're like me and didn't get it.\nWithout trying to spoil it, the overall message of the game is awesome, and really well written, and as gathered from the credits, they obviously got information and stories from people to help make it seem more authentic. I actually got attached to Sam and their story as well! The little hints or 'easter eggs' as you play through it are nice too, giving you little clues as to what the ending might be, and then you start to realize what they all meant and how they all fit into the story.\nTL;DR - Cute game with nice music, story, mechanics, and easy enough puzzles to not get annoying. Only thing I would say is disappointing is how long it is but then again I didn't expect much from a game less than \u00a32. I'd recommend it if you wanted to kill some time and wanted a nice story to interact with.\nEdit - I also just realized that Sam's username on one of the apps is 'Sam-thing' as in 'something', and his other username is 'sam-thing-else', as in something else.

Ich habe es trotz mehreren Pausen und obwohl ich nur wenige Forenbeitr\u00e4ge \u00fcbersprungen habe, auf ca. zwei Stunden gebracht. Andererseits empfinde ich es als positiv, dass die Geschichte nicht unn\u00f6tig in die L\u00e4nge gezogen wurde und auch f\u00fcr den Preis ist die Spielzeit mehr als angemessen.\n\nWer also packendes Gameplay, mitrei\u00dfende, mysteri\u00f6se Geschichten oder knifflige R\u00e4tsel erwartet, ist mit diesem Spiel leider falsch beraten. \nWer jedoch gerne einmal einen Einblick in das Leben anderer Menschen erhalten m\u00f6chte, sich von pers\u00f6nlichen Schicksalen mitgerissen, aber sich nicht von der relativ gro\u00dfen Menge Text abgeschreckt f\u00fchlt, dem kann ich \"A Normal Lost Phone\" durchaus ans Herz legen.\n\n\nZusammenfassung:\n\n+ interessante Geschichte aus dem Alltag eines jungen Menschen, die es selbst zu erforschen gilt\n+ authentische, menschlich wirkende Charaktere (englische Fassung)\n+ regt zum Nachdenken an und f\u00f6rdert Akzeptanz\n\n+/- das gesamte Spiel spielt sich auf der kargen Benutzeroberfl\u00e4che eines Smartphones ab\n+/- das Gameplay besteht aus viel Lesen und wenigen R\u00e4tseln\n+/- Soundtrack ist in Ordnung\n+/- kurze Spieldauer, welche aber sowohl dem Preis, als auch der Geschichte angemessen ist\n\nKaufempfehlung?

This game is essentially one linear text-based story, which is pretty obvious once you get into it and not particularly interesting. I mean sure, LGBT kid not accepted by their parents has to find a new life for themselves, it's pretty much the prototypical LGBT plot, whether it's books, games, movies or whatever, but you need to add something onto that for the audience to make it interesting, because we've all seen this plot before. In this context, that could have been an element of moral choice, like Replica has.\n\nSpoilers (for this game):\n\nFor example, when you pick up the phone you recieve some messages from Sam's father asking where they are. Clearly, Sam doesn't intend to tell them where they've gone, which I guess will leave the parents forever wondering if Sam got hit by a car or whatever. Clearly, the game thinks the right thing to do is to reset the phone and erase the traces, but hold on a second, it's the player supposed to be the one in control? Wouldn't it be better if there was an option to tell the parents what happened to Sam, or tell them where she is? This can even be the bad ending if you want, and the game can tell me why what I did was wrong, but the point is to have a choice. Even Life is Strange had a choice at the end and it was essentially linear. Hell, you could include other things too, like you could choose to give Phil_Free Sam's new contact details, since the game lets you send a photo to him, and they seemed to be getting along well. Maybe you could contact Sam's cousin (uncle? I forget already) Erik for some help and see if they could take her in? How about that music producer who was employing Sam? She'll be broke now in Covonia. I mean this isn't me being that creative because I've just thought about it for 5 minutes, but the point is this is supposed to be interactive fiction, if I was reading a book, I would find one that was more titilating than this one. Most of the conversations in the SMS tab are dull and repetitive (why so many people wishing you happy birthday that don't contribute anything to the story?) and don't add anything, this project needed a more judicious editor. Not to mention that when we get to the Transgender forum it turns into a straight up lecture, I mean come on! It's okay to include the social message about trans rights but at least integrate it a little better into the story.\n\nThis game wasn't totally without merit obviously, and it looks nice, but I just feel like it jumped on the 'lost phone' bandwagon without really understanding what the point in the concept was. Overall I just feel like I wasted an hour basically, other than the easy achievements.\n\nIn addition, the puzzles about the passcodes were very opaque, the one about Sam's birthday is obvious and all but accessing Sam_thing_else's profile was confusing because how are you supposed to know the significance of the not-book festival before accessing the trans forum?

So a two will suffice.\n [b] Storyline: [/b] ***.5 (I wish I had a half star XD) \u2013 I believe the story is done well, although I will acknowledge some people think that the mysteries were \u2018too easy to figure out\u2019 but personally I had a fun time learning about [spoiler]Sam[/spoiler] and their relationships with others, so I give the story a three and a half.\n[b] Difficulty: [/b] *** - It was around the right difficulty for a game of its type, and finding passwords and such not being too easy or too difficult. The right level to which I can call it a \u2018casual\u2019 game.\n[b] Character Development: [/b] *** - You are gradually led to discover [spoiler]Sam\u2019s[/spoiler] secrets, in which we learn much about them. But what do you expect? I thought that they were a somewhat complex character, and that their relationships matched what I would expect, but I also feel like some people might expect more from the story. \n [b] Gameplay and Controls: [/b] ** - It\u2019s point and click, as you might expect.\n\n[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]\n[b] Marks Overall (judged by the mode of the numbers): [/b] *** - 6/10 (although it hasn\u2019t really stuck with me like some other 6/10\u2019s)\n[b] Who Should Play This Game?: [/b] Honestly, I have no idea. Maybe visual novel enthusiasts might enjoy it, also people that are involved with the LGBTQ+ community or people struggling with that at the moment. And people looking for something different or just general casual gamers. \n\n[u] Thank you for reading!

The entire storyline core is based on that and if you're uncomfortable with said themes, look somewhere else for a narrative driven game.[/i]\n\nThe interactive story unfolding in [i]A Normal Lost Phone[/i] is heavy on LGBT-themes, a polarizing discussion both online and offline. Regardless of my irrelevant opinion on the matter, both sides of the aisle need to understand one another and actually discuss issues before resulting to name calling and blind hatred. We're all humans and we can work together to resolve our issues but this is a very touching matter for a lot of people, either on a personal aspect, a religious one, a principle one and societal one. \n\nFor better or for worse, judging the story of this game is an essential aspect of the review because as far as the actual gameplay elements go, there's very little to do and to say about.\n\nThe game begins with you, the player, finding a lost phone belonging to someone. There's a few apps, including messaging, dating and browser ones which are gonna be the crux of how the story is being [strike]narrated[/strike] read by the player. There are a few progression puzzles involved which should not be too cryptic, if anything a couple are blatantly obvious, which basically are the only parts of the game you will actually play.\n\nNow as I mentioned above and without spoiling the story, the central theme involves a LGBT person. As you 'pry' through their phone you'll uncover their secrets, their fears, their relationship with friends/strangers/family, their hopes and dreams, and for a good while you might empathize with the character. There are few nice reads here and there, there were some nice messages at times and some holier-than-thou preaching at others. Despite the [b]not so subtle[/b] messages the game is trying to promote, there were moments where it made me reflect on the hardships some LGBT people face in their every day life. I want to believe that the developers were actually aiming for that and I have to say they succeeded in achieving that goal for the most part.\n\nNonetheless, the game attempts to also inform/educate non-LGBT people like a tumblr post at certain times. There are better ways to convey a message to people you want to influence, more subtlety does wonders and in my opinion is a huge way to actually find meaning, especially in an interactive medium, but [i]A Normal Lost Phone[/i] does not do subtle things. It just opens up and lets all the messages come in the most direct, albeit honest, way possible and for that I was kinda disappointed. There's no real mystery to unravel, they're no hints for the story and besides the main story, there's not really anything else interesting to learn about even though there a few alluring subplots that could have been developed.\n\nNow do I recommend this game for everyone? Absolutely not. The game might appear to actually trying to push an agenda and you'll be partially correct. The game is also trying to promote tolerance and acceptance for LGBT people and you'll be partially correct. Different people and different opinions will react to this game on a whole different level. From a pure gameplay point of view, the game is incredibly short, ~2 hours, and there's very little to actually do. I did find it extremely fascinating to actually simulating prying into someone else's life through their social media platforms (sort of reminiscent of the game [b]Orwell[/b]) and the story despite being predictable and preachy at times, was for the most part interesting enough. The pricing on this game is also extremely accurate for its length. Finally, I cannot stress enough the fact that this is a very polarizing issue to have present in a narrative driven game and despite some of its nice messages buyer should be aware and beware of what they are getting into.", "timestamp_created": 1494885944, "timestamp_updated": 1495157441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619468", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31777173": {"recommendationid": "31777173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035041717", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494956523}, "language": "german", "review": "Kleines, aber sehr liebevoll gestaltetes Spiel mit einer wirklich ergreifenden Geschichte, die in keinster Weise konstruiert wird, sondern sowohl fantastisch als auch lebensnah.

Geburtstag wie vom Erdboden verschluckt zu sein scheint. Alles was euch einen Hinweis zu seinem Verbleib liefern k\u00f6nnte ist sein Smartphone, das in seiner Heimatstadt zur\u00fcckblieb. So tastet ihr euch langsam in dem Mobiltelefon vor und nutzt alle zur Verf\u00fcgung stehenden Optionen, wie anf\u00e4nglich die Nachrichten in einem Chat, der \u00e4hnlich wie das uns bekannte Whats App aufgebaut ist. Ihr st\u00f6bert die Textnachrichten durch und k\u00f6nnt aus den Dialogen einige erste R\u00fcckschl\u00fcsse und Hinweise herausfiltern. Gleichzeitig sind aus den Zeiten der Nachrichten und dem Kalender mit Eintr\u00e4gen weitere Strukturen sichtbar.\n\nNat\u00fcrlich wird es kaum reichen, durch die Texte den Verbleib von Sam herauszufinden, denn der hat sich genau an seinem 18. Geburtstag dem Smartphone entledigt. Mit den erste Spuren im Textverlauf ist es aber m\u00f6glich, dass Wlan zu aktivieren und somit auf weitere Apps, wie zum Beispiel dem E-Mail Fach Zugriff zu haben. Mithilfe der gesendeten und empfangenen Emails, r\u00fcckt ihr immer weiter zur Wahrheit. Ihr erschlie\u00dft weitere Passw\u00f6rter und landet ferner sogar auf einer Dating-App. Zudem machen immer mehr der bereits gelesenen Texte Sinn und erschlie\u00dfen weitere Verstrickungen.\n\nDie spielerische Note besteht eigentlich nur darin zu kombinieren, Passw\u00f6rter zu erschlie\u00dfen, Dateien zu laden und Texte richtig zu deuten. Dies verlangt nur wenige Handgriffe. Wer zudem eine schnelle Auffassungsgabe hat, kann binnen 2 Stunden hinter Sams Geheimnis und dem aktuellen Verbleib kommen. Nichtsdestotrotz ist A Normal Lost Phone so intelligent verstrickt, dass es euch bis zum Ende im Ungewissen l\u00e4sst oder eure Phantasie in die falsche Richtung lenkt.\n\nDas ungew\u00f6hnliche Spiel ist haupts\u00e4chlich f\u00fcr die mobilen Endger\u00e4te zugeschnitten, was man auf Steam sofort bemerkt. Ihr agiert in einem hoch gekanteten Bild, das ein Smartphone-Display simuliert. Die Aufmachung ist recht simple und die vorhandenen Fotos sind in einem comichaften Stil in das Spiel eingebunden. Ansonsten ist einfach nur viel Text vorhanden, der ohnehin schon keine optische Aufmachung braucht. Der Text kann im \u00dcbrigen auf deutsch oder englisch eingestellt werden.\n\nDer Clou an A Normal Lost Phone ist wohl der Soundtrack, der gleich mit kompletten Musikst\u00fccken \u00e4hnlich wie Life is Strange daherkommt. Zumeist sind es ziemlich melancholische St\u00fccke, die Sam auf seinem Smartphone hat, damit aber wohl auch seine Verfassung widerspiegelt. In der vorhandenen Musikapp d\u00fcrft ihr die Songs nach Belieben ausw\u00e4hlen und abspielen lassen. Gef\u00e4llt euch ein Musikst\u00fcck besonders gut, k\u00f6nnt ihr es so oft h\u00f6ren, wie ihr nur wollt, andere hingegen auch \u00fcberspringen. Zur kompletten Atmosph\u00e4re passt es zwar nur bedingt, die Idee ist aber so gut eingebracht, das es wiederum das Spiel authentisiert.\n\nFazit:\nA Normal Lost Phone ist ein recht kurzes Spiel, was die Spieler aber packt und nicht mehr loslassen wird. Das Geheimnis, was immer weiter offengelegt wird und das Verschwinden von Sam ist so toll inszeniert, dass man jeden einzelnen Chat lie\u00dft und selbst schon Spekulationen betreibt, was vorgefallen sein k\u00f6nnte. Und dennoch schafft es der Titel, einen auf die falsche F\u00e4hrte zu schicken und ferner mit einigen \u00dcberraschungen aufzuwarten, die man so nicht vermutet h\u00e4tte. Wer jedoch den Titel nicht starr auf Steam erleben m\u00f6chte, kann gerne auf die mobile Variante zur\u00fcckgreifen, die optisch sowieso besser passt.", "timestamp_created": 1494098077, "timestamp_updated": 1494098077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31583598": {"recommendationid": "31583598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026044327", "num_games_owned": 460, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494083754}, "language": "english", "review": "Sigh. \n\nIt's a neat little concept for a game.

Y resalto el descubran porque su forma de desbloquear m\u00e1s sobre la historia de Sam es desentramando claves para sus cuentas privadas o hasta para una se\u00f1a de Wifi. Esta mec\u00e1nica me encant\u00f3, me hizo sentir que de verdad estaba viendo un m\u00f3vil de una persona real, aunque en un momento espec\u00edfico me frustr\u00f3 y casi cojo una gu\u00eda de internet. Si... no soy tan listo como para darme cuenta de varias obviedades, pero llegu\u00e9 a solucionar los que podr\u00edamos llamar como \u201cacertijos\u201d del juego de una manera l\u00f3gica y muy natural.\nTodo es totalmente cre\u00edble y mucho de ello tiene que ver el uso del celular. El concepto de las redes sociales, emails, foros,  aplicaciones, etc, est\u00e1n muy bien manejados para dar coherencia a toda esta historia. \nB\u00e1sicamente la historia de A Normal Lost Phone es mostrada en capas que iremos removiendo mientras m\u00e1s continuemos inmiscuy\u00e9ndonos.\nAhora quiero hablarles de dos detalles importantes de este juego que pocas veces he visto mencionar, el apartado gr\u00e1fico y su m\u00fasica.\nComo en un m\u00f3vil aqu\u00ed tenemos una aplicaci\u00f3n para escuchar m\u00fasica mientras nos inmiscuimos en los secretos de Sam. Siendo sincero no s\u00e9 si programaron para que suenen ciertas canciones en momentos espec\u00edficos ya que cada melod\u00eda coordinaba con lo que ve\u00eda y le\u00eda. Adem\u00e1s, al finalizar el juego (de eso hablar\u00e9 despu\u00e9s sin spoilers), me di cuenta de que los mismos secretos de Sam siempre estuvieron en la m\u00fasica, en las dulces, dram\u00e1ticas y bellas canciones que me acompa\u00f1aban mientras me inmiscu\u00eda en su vida.\nAhora que caigo en cuenta, en esta rese\u00f1a estoy entre la delgada l\u00ednea entre un voyeur y un videojugador apasionado. Ejem\u2026 mejor sigo.\nBueno, ahora el apartado gr\u00e1fico. Simplemente es tan colorido y tan juvenil. Todas las formas, el estilo, el color, es como estar viendo un libro de una historia de adolescentes, es tan refrescante ver un estilo as\u00ed. Me recuerda mucho a varios libros de historias y cuentos europeos para j\u00f3venes. \nSI quieren buscar a la persona responsable de este bello apartado gr\u00e1fico busquen a Estelle Charri\u00e9, ya me enamor\u00e9 de su p\u00e1gina de Tumblr.\nmmmm\u2026 hay Kaze, como siempre y\u00e9ndote por las ramas, bueno ten\u00eda que recomendarles a este artista como artista gr\u00e1fico que soy >w<\nBueno, ahora la ceresita del pastel, el final y la conclusi\u00f3n del juego.\nPara los que han terminado esta obra de arte multimedia ya deben saber los conceptos y el contexto que maneja, y siendo sincero lo maneja muy bien. Como me puse a leer y releer varios de los textos iniciales me hizo pensar much\u00edsimas posibilidades sobre a donde se dirigir\u00eda Sam y porque no tiene su celular contigo. \u00a1Dios santo! Me preocup\u00e9 del bienestar de Sam como si de un amigo se tratara\u2026 emmm\u2026 ahora me siento un poco m\u00e1s voyeur que antes TwT\nEjem\u2026 pero bueno, el final que nos deja esta obra es muy cre\u00edble con toda la narrativa y, al igual que un libro, sabemos hasta donde llega el l\u00edmite de nosotros, como lectores, con este m\u00f3vil. Incluso el realismo de las palabras y el mismo sistema de juego dan una experiencia extremadamente emp\u00e1tica.\nEn fin, que puedo decir con este videojuego, simplemente es una maravilla y una experiencia muy peculiar y asombrosa. Esta es una obra que tiene el fin de mostrar que nuestra vida puede estar encerrada en un objeto que llevamos en nuestro bolsillo y tambi\u00e9n que cada persona es su propio mundo con problemas, alegr\u00edas, tristezas, dilemas, sue\u00f1os y\u2026. las ganas de querer ser lo que uno desea y no lo que el mundo desee.\nAs\u00ed que qu\u00e9 esperan, vayan c\u00f3mprenlo, por lo que vi tanto en Steam como en Android est\u00e1 a unos $3. De preferencia c\u00f3mprenlo en su dispositivo m\u00f3vil ya que la experiencia se vuelve mil veces m\u00e1s inmersiva.\nY gente\u2026 si ven un celular en la calle, busquen a su due\u00f1o o intenten localizarlo para devolv\u00e9rselo, tal vez encuentren a alguien como Sam que necesita mucho apoyo.\nBueno, aqu\u00ed se despide DanielKaze, diciendo\u2026 Sam\u2026 vive feliz donde quiera que est\u00e9s.

I also found the concept of unravelling a story through the use of looking through someone's phone to be an interesting one. If this also sounds like you, then go ahead and buy it. Now, onto the real part of the review.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD\n\nI was really not expecting the story to take the turn it did. If you're observant, which I wasn't, you'll see the warning at the bottom about homophobic themes. When reading through everything, I expected the worst. I thought maybe Sam had been kidnapped or had genuinely gone missing. It's not until you start digging that you realise that Sam is actually a trans-woman. Maybe I'm exagurrating but I think the way the game reveals this is perfect and once you figure out what's going on, everything fits together really well. The game does a brilliant job of making you feel like a detective. \n\nI know a lot of people will be turned away from the themes of this game, but fuck 'em. Yeah sure, \"SJW\" themes are somewhat overdone in games these days, but I couldn't care less. This game does a brilliant job of highlighting the problems that trans people, or even just the LGBT community, go through and also the issue of coming out to a family that might not accept you for who you are.\n\nThat said, I have a few issues with the game that stop it from being perfect. The first issue is that the music player doesn't really serve a purpose and is honestly more destracting than anything. Trying to read large walls of text with music getting progressivly louder in the background is really difficult for me. It also served no purpose when it comes to puzzle solving. The second issue is that, while I apretiate it, a lot of the posts on the \"Be You\" forum seemed repetetive and not worth reading. Most of the posts there had nothing to do with the story, and while I do find it interesting to read about the LGBT community, a lot of the stuff there could've easily been compressed down. My thrid issue was the puzzles, some of them are a tad too cryptic. I feel like most people will need a walkthrough. And finally the ending. I'm not a fan of it. Maybe I'm bad for sympathising for Sam's parents... but I do. For all they know, their son/now daughter is completely missing. Possibly dead. But no. Sam just ran away from home without telling anyone. I know they are bigoted scumbags, but I feel like everyone should be treated with respect. Even bigoted scumbags. They have a right to know what happened to their child. In my eyes, Sam should've come out to them. The worst that could've happened would be them disowning her. Which, at the end of the day, is what she supposedly wanted anyway, because she ran away. I'm not sure how I feel about the ending. I'm usually a fan of bad endings, but this ending just makes the main character (Sam) unlikeable. \n\nBut honestly overall, I enjoyed this experience. While it has its shortcomings in polish and storytelling, I feel as though it does a great job of telling a story in an interesting way.

Something buzzes and you reflexively reach for your pocket, but your phone is minding its own business. A gleam of light makes you look down. On the ground by your right foot you can see the lit screen of a fancy new smartphone. It identifies itself as the culprit behind the disturbance by displaying a message: \u201c4 new messages from Dad.\u201d You pick it up, hit accept, and the phone immediately offers up the messages in question. Dad is worried. Mom wants to call the police. The phone\u2019s owner, Sam, seems to be missing.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on with Sam? Some troubles are immediately apparent: a relationship in turmoil, friends revealing unsavoury character aspects, family secrets. Even though the game is short, playing it feels like settling in for the long haul as the player learns the names, relationships, and dates most important for Sam while trawling for a solution to a problem that has long since transcended the simple matter of returning a lost phone. Peeling back each layer by figuring out how to access and interpret all of the phone\u2019s apps reveals Sam\u2019s fleshed-out character nested in a web of complex social networks, acting and reacting like any of us would to events large and small.\n\nWhat interested me most about ANLP is the meta-experience of playing. Statistically, most players will not have personal experience with the issues ANLP seeks to discuss, even though a slightly higher number might have encountered the topics through friends, and most will have engaged with some form of related media coverage. Many players will only have sparse, incomplete, or downright incorrect information on the topics discussed, but I would wager that some would relish a real-world opportunity to dig through the personal life of someone like Sam.

The game goes from a fun personalized experience to an encyclopedia of transness complete with definitions and bolding. I cringed. \n\n2. The random suicide attempt came out of nowhere, was not resolved, and then was immediately forgotten about by all. What a cheap attempt at shock. Make it a plot point or don't, have characters react to it in a major way or don't mention it at all. What you did was the equivalent of an emotional jump scare, smacking us with something really huge and then moving on with everyone unscathed. How shallow is our main character that he goes from \"I caused my ex girlfriend to attempt suicide\" to \"everything's coming up milhouse\" in a few days??? You could make an entire other game about the guilt that causes.\n\n3.

Su historia es muy atrapante te insita a investigar,investigar y seguir investigando\n\n-Sus logros...

Imagine someone picking it up and reading all your private messages, looking at your kinky pictures or secret diary entries. Feeling uncomfortable already? Well, you might better lock your phone with a passcode next time\u2026[/b]\n\nIn [b]A Normal Lost Phone[/b], you are the one finding such an unprotected phone. It seems your ultimate desire is to find out what happened to its owner. Maybe you want to give it back or maybe you just enjoy snooping around in someone else\u2019s private affairs. To do this, you will read the owner\u2019s private messages, crack passwords, find secrets and listen to one of the best soundtracks in video games.\n\nA [b]Normal Lost Phone[/b] is another entry in a series of recently released phone simulators such as Sara Is Missing or Replica. Other than these examples, this game is not about scaring you to death or criticizing data privacy issues in general. This game tells you a story about the 18-year old owner of the phone. Basically, it\u2019s a very well-written coming of age story that doesn\u2019t shy away from tackling difficult and relevant topics such as puberty, homophobia, friendship and love. It is impressive how the developers [b]Accidental Queens[/b] manage to pack so many compelling events in just text messages, photos and forum entries. The discussions feel natural most of the time, presenting the most accurate texts written by parents in video game history. These could have just been written by my own parents (except some political views) which feels quite scary at times. Here comes the time for a disclaimer: Although the game isn\u2019t very long (about two hours) you will spend most of time reading. Not all of it is relevant to finish the game, but most of it is quite entertaining with little side stories here and there. So, players who don\u2019t enjoy reading a lot in games might have some troubles with the game. The game basically simulates a phone interface with several apps such as a calendar, mail app, browser, weather app etc. It feels very much like using a real smartphone, although the software might be a bit outdated. It\u2019s a voyeuristic experience and you will feel awkward from time to time violating someone\u2019s privacy. Be prepared to question your own morals!\n\nNevertheless, [b]A Normal Lost Phone[/b] is a game that leaves you behind with a good feeling and with the urge to dig deeper into it\u2019s themes. The story is compelling enough to drag you into the game (and the phone) but falls a little short towards the end once the big mystery is solved. The riddles are mostly logic and quite easy to solve for attentive readers. Overall, [b]A Normal Lost Phone[/b] can be considered one of the most beautifully designed games on the market. In it\u2019s simplicity, the hand-drawn phone interface mixes very well with the stunning soundtrack that can carry all the right emotions.

There's a lot of reading, and the \"puzzles\" aren't that hard, it just depends on whether or not you were able to notice the clues.\n\nThe ending... I don't know if I can say whether it was satisfying or not, since as I said, it's not really that much of a mystery, but I will say that I only really predicted the ending right before I got to it, or almost as I was getting it, so it's not like you see it coming a mile away.\n\nSo! Good, interesting story (very socially \"charged\", but it didn't really bother me), it felt like it was meant to be a tool to educate a lot of people on the social issue it adresses.

In order to work out the mystery, you need to trawl through their social medias, connecting the dots that open up new clues. I like how subtly some of these dots are integrated, requiring you to really look hard over what you're given. There's also a really captivating, interesting story, as twists and turns are revealed which encourage you to reexamine things in a new context.\n\nAlso, because someone out there would probably yell at me for not bringing this up, yes, this is one of these 'ess-jay-dubya' games that have themes of race and LGBT life as part of the narrative. If that's something that'll turn you off the game, there you go, that's your warning.\n\nTo anyone else though, I really do recommend this game.

Basicamente como o t\u00edtulo j\u00e1 diz, encontramos um celular (n\u00f3s, os jogadores) e nele vamos descobrindo segredos sobre a vida do Protagonista: Sam, cujo perdeu seu celular. Sabemos at\u00e9 mesmo pela p\u00e1gina da Steam que Sam acaba desaparecendo quando completa 18 anos, o motivo? s\u00f3 explorando o celular para descobrir, isso atribuindo a uma trilha sonora fant\u00e1stica j\u00e1 que \u00e9 um celular e tem aplicativos como: Calculadora, Rede Social (diferente), Mensagens e tudo mais. \n\nO enredo \u00e9 este, voc\u00ea tem que explorar o celular perdido e no final contamos com um plot twist sensacional do qual devemos tomar a atitude correta, apagar os dados ou n\u00e3o? o jogo tem apenas um final, poderia ter um final alternativo caso o jogador pudesse optar por n\u00e3o deletar tudo o que viu, assim afetando todo uma base de amigos, fam\u00edlia e tudo mais sobre Sam. Mas \u00e9 isso, temos apenas um final, mas n\u00e3o deixa de ser um final digno e completo e com um roteiro muito bem escrito, contextualizado e totalmente em Portugues do Brasil. \n\nOs Puzzles se comparados ao de Replica s\u00e3o absurdamente faceis, eu como sou um cara que me irrito f\u00e1cil, me peguei vendo o guia para descobrir o mais r\u00e1pido sobre o enredo do jogo, que meus amigos ... \u00e9 a parte principal. Se voc\u00ea gosta de Puzzles, mas logo de cara se pegou louco para saber o que realmente se esconde nas camadas do celular, meu amigo, foque no enredo e esquece seus pequenos Puzzles. O foco do jogo n\u00e3o \u00e9 isso e sim a sua narrativa completamente bem estruturada e bela. \n\nEste jogo \u00e9 um jogo (livro) do qual muitas pessoas tem de levar em considera\u00e7\u00e3o que \u00e9 s\u00f3 leitura e nada mais. Mas \u00e9 uma leitura v\u00e1lida, s\u00f3lida, bem escrita, bonita, triste, bela, tr\u00e1gica. \n\nE o principal, \u00e9 um aprendizado para todo o jogador que vai jogar este pequeno jogo, principalmente nas partes finais quando entramos em uma rede social alternativa, onde encontramos detalhes e mais detalhes sobre o assunto abordado no jogo, \u00e9 uma aula interativa sobre um assunto s\u00e9rio. Mas que assunto s\u00e9rio \u00e9 este voc\u00ea me pergunta, eu n\u00e3o vou te responder, jogue e ver\u00e1.\n\nMas jogue com a mente aberta, jogue para tirar conhecimento deste t\u00edtulo pequeno mas incr\u00edvel e que vale totalmente seu pre\u00e7o full pela sua incr\u00edvel narrativa, pela ajuda das pessoas que contribuiram para abrir a mente de pessoas cujo tem suas mentes completamente fechadas sobre certos temas. \n\nPontos positivos e negativos:\n\n- Enredo bem escrito e que ensina o jogador e que o faz aprender sobre um tema s\u00e9rio. \n- Trilha Sonora sens\u00e1cional, mesmo sendo pequena.\n- Design do Celular muito bonito.\n- Fotos bonitas em formato \"HQ\" \"Cartoon\" \n- Rodando perfeitamente sem qualquer tipo de BUG.\n- Conquistas faceis de conseguir.\n- Puzzles de n\u00edvel m\u00e9dio para f\u00e1cil, voc\u00ea tem um guia na Steam caso queira se focar inteiramente na proposta principal do jogo: Seu enredo fant\u00e1stico.\n- \u00d3timo final, soberbo.\n\nPontos Negativos:\n\n- Poderia ter mais explora\u00e7\u00e3o nos aplicativos, j\u00e1 que s\u00e3o poucos.\n- Poderia ter mais dicas para quem quer seguir direto na hist\u00f3ria. \n- Portugu\u00eas do Brasil com alguns erros, mas que provavelmente v\u00e3o ser corrigidos e nada que atrapalhe o entendimento da narrativa.\n\n\nPontos Neutros:\n\n- O jogo poderia ter 2 finais, o que seria excelente, j\u00e1 que o final \u00e9 uma mistura de felicidade e ao mesmo tempo tristeza por n\u00e3o saber o que aconteceu com o resto do n\u00facleo familiar e amigos. Deletar ou n\u00e3o deletar tudo do celular? poderia ter um final optando por n\u00e3o deletar e assim ter uma consequ\u00eancia muito maior e pesada. \n\n\nA Normal Lost Phone \u00e9 uma experi\u00eancia curta, focada inteiramente no enredo e que abre o jogo da metade para o final e entrega um final s\u00f3lido. Abrindo a mente de jogadores com mente fechadas e dando uma aula sobre um tema que \u00e9 muito importante na sociedade. Um jogo - aula que todos deveriam jogar.\n\nDepois de se descobrir tudo e seus pequenos puzzles, n\u00e3o restam mais o que fazer, \u00e9 s\u00f3 absorver a aula do jogo e pronto, est\u00e1 aqui uma pequena p\u00e9rola dos Indie Games.\n\nAAA Games, vamos aprender um pouco com Indies? \n\nTotalmente recomendado a full price!", "timestamp_created": 1485511093, "timestamp_updated": 1485511093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702406", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29517536": {"recommendationid": "29517536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064397631", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492447114}, "language": "czech", "review": "Koncept A Normal Lost Phone mo\u017en\u00e1 na prvn\u00ed pohled p\u016fsob\u00ed trochu \"\u00fachyln\u011b\", ale ve skute\u010dnosti to tak v\u016fbec nen\u00ed.

I feel like ive wasted my money. The gameplay is dull, at first i thought it would be something interesting, like pony island. But no, I was very disapointed. The puzzles can almost all be solved by looking up a date in your messages (It's almost just memorize the important dates and just use them one by one till one works). The story is being told in an interesting way, however the story itself isn't anything amazing. This could have easily been a book and a bad one as well. \n\nThe story is very straightforward and not worth the praise. I really don't understand all the positive reviews. Yes, the subject is very controversial and controversial stories are hard to write in a way that won't offend any party. But this is just? wat? What is that ending?? Did I just waste 2 hours of my life for that ending? I thought it would be more interesting.\n\nThe main characters are Sam, Alice and Melissa. The most interesting one is Melissa, yet her story felt rushed and I just wanted to know more about her. But thanks to that ending I couldn't.\n\nTo be fair this game has a good thing going for it which is the music. It is genuinely the only thing I enjoyed. It helped me go through this hell with fewer scars.\n\nIf all you want in your game is a good soundtrack, then yes go ahead and buy this. If you want to play a game then don't buy this.

You have found the phone and are investigating the texts and messages on it (presumably for the purposes of returning it). The story details Sam's challenges and struggles, and the level of intimacy is beautifully conveyed through the messages between them and their family/acquaintances. I enjoyed the writing of the characters and relationships, which felt remarkably human (for something that was conveyed purely through text messages). The game feels like it was based on a true story, and if it was, I hope that the people who were challenged by similar problems have been/will be able to resolve them.\n\nThe puzzle elements of the game were fascinating and very enjoyable, but felt a little out of character. Most of the puzzles involve working out the passwords to Sam's private accounts. To me, it felt very intrusive and not something that I'd do if I found someone's lost phone. Most of the puzzles were reasonably straight forward, but there were two which I thought were significantly more obtuse than the other ones. That being said, I managed to complete the game in a bit over an hour.\n\nSome of the messages in the game leant a little too heavy on agenda-pushing. Now while I understand the point of the game was for the sake of understanding Sam's challenges, there was a part of the writing that felt like it was directed not at Sam, but the player. To be fair, the part I am referring to does make sense in context, but it just felt a little offputting that the writer was trying to express their opinion when it wasn't really necessary story-wise.\n\nHowever, the majority of the game is a well-done telling of a story that isn't told often enough.

Y no por falta de oportunidad. Creo que a lo largo de mi vida he perdido dos m\u00f3viles y me han robado un bolso con otro tel\u00e9fono, la cartera, apuntes de la carrera y una c\u00e1mara digital llena de fotos. Es probable que todos esos retazos de vida a medio hilar, sin un contexto que les diera continuidad, ni siquiera hayan provocado inter\u00e9s en quien los hallara. Habr\u00e1 acabado todo en una tienda de segunda mano, o vaya usted a saber, eran tiempos en los que los m\u00f3viles no estaban conectados a Internet.\n\nSin embargo, tras probar A Normal Lost Phone s\u00ed que me lo planteo. No por miedo a mi privacidad, sino porque creo que a medida que recorremos el camino que nos da entendemos que hay un mundo en cada persona, no s\u00f3lo el nuestro propio. Ya no es un tel\u00e9fono, sino la vida de alguien.\n\nEn el juego del colectivo francoespa\u00f1ol Accidental Queens no podr\u00eda partir de una premisa m\u00e1s sencilla: acabamos de encontrar un smartphone perdido, y, qu\u00e9 cosas, est\u00e1 desbloqueado. La \u00fanica mec\u00e1nica que vamos a hallar aqu\u00ed ser\u00e1 la propia interacci\u00f3n con el tel\u00e9fono, cuyo sistema operativo simula el de cualquier otro m\u00f3vil, y una peque\u00f1a interacci\u00f3n inicial que nos pone en marcha: varios mensajes del padre de la persona que lo ha perdido.\n\n\nA partir de aqu\u00ed tenemos libertad absoluta para decidir lo que hacer con \u00e9l. Podemos salirnos del mismo juego y evitar lo que nos propone, borrando todos los datos del terminal. Quiz\u00e1 sea un sepelio digital para proteger la identidad de la persona que lo ha perdido, o una forma de no querer tener que ver con la historia que podemos descubrir, pero hasta ah\u00ed llega nuestra libertad de acci\u00f3n.\n\nEvidentemente, esto es un videojuego y hemos venido a experimentarlo. Y, para qu\u00e9 enga\u00f1arnos, el cebo de los primeros mensajes ya pone a funcionar los resortes de nuestra curiosidad.\n\nR\u00e1pidamente exploraremos los mensajes del terminal e iremos haci\u00e9ndonos una visi\u00f3n general de lo que le ha podido pasar a su poseedor. En este acercamiento a las escenas de vida digitales se parece mucho a Gone Home o Her Story: la trama de A Normal Lost Phone no funcionar\u00eda ni la mitad de bien en otro entorno que no fuera el del videojuego. Sus puzles, por llamarlos de alguna manera, son org\u00e1nicos y no forzados: no podemos acceder con \u00e9l a Internet porque no tenemos la contrase\u00f1a del WiFi, necesitamos saber datos biogr\u00e1ficos de la propia persona para explorar algunas otras aplicaciones\u2026\n\nS\u00f3lo hay un momento en el que nos deja caer una pista de algo que ya de por s\u00ed era bastante evidente, pero el resto del tiempo respeta al jugador y no insulta a su inteligencia con mec\u00e1nicas que no vienen a cuento. S\u00f3lo la interacci\u00f3n con el terminal y sus aplicaciones, nuestra propia curiosidad y lo despierto que sea nuestro intelecto. Como el incentivo aqu\u00ed no es m\u00e1s que desentra\u00f1ar la propia historia detr\u00e1s del tel\u00e9fono, han acertado haciendo que no sea tampoco un reto inmenso, porque la frustraci\u00f3n bien podr\u00eda hacer que el jugador perdiera el inter\u00e9s. Un dise\u00f1o muy equilibrado, natural y elegante.\n\nSin embargo, lo m\u00e1s valioso de A Normal Lost Phone no est\u00e1 en su propia mec\u00e1nica (que es fant\u00e1stica), sino en lo r\u00e1pidamente que muta de simulador de voyeur hacia un videojuego de tipo experiencial, emp\u00e1tico, muy en la l\u00ednea de t\u00edtulos como Depression Quest.\n\nLa historia que va hilando (o m\u00e1s bien, que nosotros tejemos con los retazos que encontremos) es sencilla, pero le sonar\u00e1 a muchas personas de varios colectivos que no suelen estar representados en los videojuegos. No es para nada estridente, y puede apreciarse mucha naturalidad tanto en los di\u00e1logos como en los mensajes, algo que es realmente dif\u00edcil de conseguir.\n\n\nPuede que no lleguemos hasta el final de lo que ha pasado, que nos queden dudas o falten piezas, pero est\u00e1 claro que al \u201cterminar\u201d la partida nos habremos sentido por un momento en el lugar de otra persona. Que pensemos en una situaci\u00f3n en la que para nada se nos habr\u00eda ocurrido pensar (salvo, claro, que sea similar a la nuestra).\n\nLo que consigue A Normal Lost Phone es doble: por un lado que entendamos que cada cacharro perdido, cada m\u00f3vil abandonado, pertenece a una persona que vive y respira, que siente y padece igual que nosotros. Parece una tonter\u00eda, pero es desolador lo r\u00e1pido que tendemos a olvidar el hecho vital de los dem\u00e1s. Y por otro lado, nos traslada una experiencia que quiz\u00e1 no conozcamos, sin dramatismos pero con la crudeza esperable.\n\nDesde luego, si el objetivo de un videojuego es muchas veces sacarnos de nuestro mundo y llevarnos a otro, aqu\u00ed lo consigue. Un mundo no tan lejano, pero tristemente invisible. Espero que me hagan caso cuando les digo que merece la pena vivirlo. El \u00fanico riesgo que correremos ser\u00e1 entender un poquito mejor a los dem\u00e1s.", "timestamp_created": 1485446970, "timestamp_updated": 1485446970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.767882", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29504054": {"recommendationid": "29504054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028100581", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485198355}, "language": "german", "review": "A Normal Lost Phone ist eine spezielle Spielerfahrung, die mehrere Themen geschickt miteinander verbindet.

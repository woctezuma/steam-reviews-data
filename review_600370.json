After a bit of brainstorming, I remembered that I still never tried Paradigm, a highly acclaimed point'n'click adventure.\n\nTo be honest, when I first saw it on Steam, I checked screenshots and videos and was a bit confused of what I saw in there - everything was complete weird, creepy and inadequate. So I thought it was going to be another stupid p'n'c with ridiculous puzzles and humour category \"B\" .\nSo I passed at that time. Then I saw it has a pretty good score and some of my friends recommended this game, so I bought it on sale. \n\nSo, Paradigm. One of the weirdest sh\u0456t I ever played! I was right a bit about its ridiculous puzzles, though you cant complain about such thing in a game like this. On the other hand, every move you make has its own \"reasonable\" explanation in a further playthrough. But puzzles are not the main thing in this game. The real gem here is its characters and its deep stupid and,at the same time, clever humour, with a bunch of different refferences. Another thing to mention, is, of course, highly artistic style-unique illustrations in game and attention to the details, which make this game so adorable and amazing at the same time.     \n\nYou are playing as a...whatever it is. I mean, I don't wanna spoil it for you, you should see it and experience it for yourself. That's the whole point of the game - it has a lot of hidden messages and deep meaning, which everyone should discover and find answers for yourself. The whole atmosphere is so charming and disturbing at the same time, that you eager to stay in that universe as long as possible to solve all these puzzles, to click every item, to listen to all these ridiculous and funny dialogues with a bunch of sarcastic answers and funny responses, which can easily become a golden quotes, somewhere in the future. I really don't want to spoil it for you, it's just mesmerizing and you should experience everything by yourself without any knowledge of what you are going to face further. It's an unique product which you can enjoy only once in a few years, so do your best to enjoy it as much as possible!\n\nThis is a perfect example of what a masterpiece p'n'c game should look like, how the money gathered from the backers should be spent, how your work should be done with all passion and respect to yourself and your customers.       \n\nSo, to sum everything up!\nYou should grab this game if you:\n\n+ Love classic point and click games\n+ Love to enjoy artistic detailed well drawn illustrations\n+ Missed that type of games, full of unique funny characters, bunch of smart dark humor and cool references to other games, movies, TV shows, etc.\n+ Wanna spend a really fun evening or two playing an amazing game\n\nRecommend to avoid if you:\n\n- Expect a really long game. Game can be beated in 3 hours easily, or even less, if you are smart enough :)\n- Love difficult brainstorming puzzles. Puzzles are pretty much easy in here, I was literally stucked only for a 2 times and when I came to the conclusion, it looked pretty much obvious to me and I felt dumb.\n- Don't like weird unusual unexplainable surrealistic stuff, this game is all about that,\n\nEnjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1511874468, "timestamp_updated": 1511874468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652510", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37857306": {"recommendationid": "37857306", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116341065", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500142393}, "language": "english", "review": "I first found out about this game a few years ago maybe? when I came across a video of someone playing the beta version of the game.

It's so... weird. Nothing I ever expected, even after what I already knew about it. Everything's kind of just all over the place and nothing makes sense, which, well, makes kind of sense? considering the whole premise of the game and post-apocalyptic world and all that jazz.

It also mentions tumors, environmental crisis and other things that are considered taboo in the family friendly comedy, and one must be a true knight of black humor (south park grade) to dare fooling around them. But the thing is - just DARING to depict such things does NOT equal good jokes about them. And no, adding butts and balls to all this trivia does not help either. I need a joke in my fart joke, otherwise it\u2019s just a fart.\nHaving one hour spent in the game and then returning it, I felt like it was a really shameful waste of time.

The story and dialogue are hilarious, the characters are eccentric, quirky, and well designed, the artwork and music are extraordinary, and the voice acting is amazing.

The humor is obviously twisted (which I enjoyed, and found quite refreshing), but also finds its way into many tech-pop culture allusions.

There was one puzzle near the end of the game that I found quite awkward and difficult to solve; besides that one hitch, the consistency of the puzzle challenges was well thought out. The atmosphere was great, and was extremely effective at giving you an 80's synth/retro throwback ambience.\n\nOverall, Paradigm is a game that stays faithful to the character of classic adventure games that people like me love, however it manages to bring something completely new to the table with its unique sense of twisted humor, graphics, and refreshing brand of story-telling.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who's looking to have some fun and laugh while they're at it (regardless of genre preference).", "timestamp_created": 1500751748, "timestamp_updated": 1500752646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33643632": {"recommendationid": "33643632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030817501", "num_games_owned": 2153, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500435576}, "language": "english", "review": "Quality point and click adventure.

I'm even thinking of doing another playthrough just to make sure i didn't miss any jokes.\n\nThere are also quite a few mini-games around, some to be discovered and some as part of the main storyline. Like everything else, they ooze with humor. Even the menu does. This is the kind of adventure game that rewards even the most mundane methods of exploration (like talking to every object or trying to pick it up, just to hear what Paradigm will say).\n\nIf I have to critique the game i'd have a hard time, but some of the repeating jokes do get a bit stale (like paradigm's lack of self-esteem) and the ending, while hilarious, raises a lot of unanswered questions.\nI recommend getting this, even if it's full price.

The game is set in some unnamed Eastern European country in the near future after an unknown apocalypse has taken place. The main character is Paradigm. He is a shy, insecure, heavely disfigured mutant who stumbles upon a plot to overtake what is left of the world. The game doesn't take itself very seriously and it's main goal is to entertain. Most of the puzzles are easy while some are more challenging, but they never go overboard like in the Lucasarts adventure where the solution of some puzzles required up to a dozen steps that sometimes defied logic (but were so funny, we didn't care). The amount and general quality of the voice work is above average. Many characters are voiced by Jacob and all of the voice actors provided half a dozen voices, but this wasn't noticable or distracting (well done guys). Some are really good, some are mildly annoying, but overall they do a good job and bring the characters alive. One of the things that impressed and entertained me is that every interaction with every object in the game has unique spoken lines. Not only is there a seperate voice over for each description of an object. But the lines spoken when you talk to an object, try to use it or pick it up are unique for each object. \nOne of the running gags in the game is that Paradigm is so incredibly lonely that when he can't physically pick an object up, he'll use his most sensual voice and drop a pick up line instead. After about a dozen of these pick-up lines you'd think that the developer wouldn't be able to think of any more. But you'd be wrong, there are dozens upon dozens of them in the game. The humour is never ROLF funny or even LOL funny, but the self referential and fourth wall breaking jokes had me smiling all throughout the game. The enormous amount of spoken lines do make it tiresome to play after a while, I recommend playing this games in small doses or just rush through the first time and listen to all descriptions a second time. \nThe graphics are worth a mention as well. While somewhat disturbing at times (but never really gross), they are also sharp, crisp and well drawn. The game also features some mini games with more retro pixelated graphics which are also well done. The mini games are not very challenging and instead go for laughs, much like the rest of the game.\nParadigm is a lovable anti-hero despite his stocky body and large tumors on his head, I couldn't help but symphatise with the guy. Despite the constant sexual innuendo the game manages to never cross the boundaries. Don't go in expecting a game like leisure Suit Larry, it's not a dating simulator. Having said that, there is a mini game where you can actually date three mutant love interest and like the other mini games they are played for laughs. \nThere are also numerous references to classic adventure games and pop culture. All in all a lot of love was put into this game. And there are a lot of funny details to be spotted.\nThe game isn't too long, it should take you about six to eight hours to finish and about double that if you listen to each and every description and play the game again so you can hear the creators comments in every screen. \nIn conclusion this game is highly recommended to people who enjoy games like Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle and similar classics. I can only that this game is the first of many to come from Jacob Janerka, I really enjoyed the visuals, voicework, story and many jokes he put into this game.", "timestamp_created": 1499289271, "timestamp_updated": 1499289271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33217535": {"recommendationid": "33217535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097132757", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496787447}, "language": "english", "review": "I honestly love this game.

With multiple references to Day of the Tentacle, Monkey Island, and more, this game still deliver's its own bizare story that is worth the trip. The art is beautiful (and varied which is refreshingly unexpected) and plays on many pop culture references for added LoL's.\n\nWhile it may seem odd at first, the story in all is quite solid. The puzzles complicated, but not to any unsolvable degree (I was able to complete it without needing to look up a walk through - just decent dedication to problem solving). The characters are fantasic (especially the mutated pharmasutical octopus Steph).\n\nIf there was one complaint I'd make, its that its in a 2 Act Structure opposed to a hopeful 3 Act story. This can leave the player a little disapointed when the ending suddenly appears, but not to any degree you feel cheated. Some people may be turned off by the inuendo and drug-use-based comedy, but past that hurdle is a great adventure that is worth taking.\n\nAll in all I do recomend the game.

You live in a power station in Krusz, a town of five people situated on top of all of the world's radioactive waste. Nice hey?\n\nThe game starts with you wanting to finish your latest EP, but being unable to get your computer working. Consulting JOHN-3000, the ex-TV-dating-show AI that lives with you, you find out that a hacker has corrupted your system and you need to find a floppy disk in order to restore it, and also save the world from ultimate destruction!\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe graphics in Paradigm are mostly very good. While much of the game takes place with rendered / animated characters over still, drawn backgrounds, there are also a number of interludes and other sections with differing graphical styles, providing considerable contrast. But the quality is consistent throughout.\n\nThere are no graphics settings.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nThe background music, where present, went largely unnoticed, but isn't bad by any means. The game also includes some musical tracks to fit the story. Sound effects are appropriate and mostly well made.\n\nThe game is fully voiced, but the quality of voice actors and recordings varies quite a lot, with some sounding very professional, and others that sound like the developer putting on a bad accent and speaking into a microphone. Normalisation, again, is quite variable, though mostly good; there are still a few sections where volume trails off and it can be hard to make out what is being said by some characters.\n\nSubtitles are included, though, so you won't miss anything.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nParadigm plays like a typical modern point-and-click adventure. Using the mouse to control Paradigm, you can interact with a vast array of useful and completely irrelevant or useless items, objects, and beings in Krusz and elsewhere. Left click moves Paradigm and right click opens up the interaction menu, which allows him to look at, talk to, use, or pick up the designated target. Moving the mouse pointer to the top of the screen opens the options menu, for saving and loading games or accessing the map, while moving the pointer to the bottom opens up Paradigm's typical adventure game inventory. It's a simple interface and brings nothing new to the genre, but it works well.\n\nThe largely nonsensical story wouldn't work that well as a short story or novella, but as a comedy adventure game it's great. Paradigm's world is a weird one, indeed. You'll encounter a cast of unique, but insane characters, and find yourself in very unusual situations. There's a constant barrage of puns, jokes, and innuendo, too, with almost every use of the 'pick up' action resulting in Paradigm eliciting some sort of groan-worthy pick-up line. The game breaks the fourth wall on a few occasions, and includes countless references to pop-culture and memes; I'm sure I didn't pick up on all of them, but those I saw gave me a smile or chuckle. The humour probably won't be for everyone, but within a few minutes of play you should be able to work out whether you'll enjoy it or not.\n\nThere are some rather silly mini-game sections, which provide some fun distractions, as well as some short FMV sections, which were well made.\n\nGiven the amount of writing in the game, I wasn't surprised to see a few typos and grammatical errors, but the quality of the text is generally very good.\n\nDespite the general silliness inherent in the game, the puzzles make sense and most savvy adventure game players shouldn't require continual access to a walkthrough. The developer has provided one on the game's website, though, so it's there if you need it.\n\nThe game is relatively short -- I'd estimate it would take most people somewhere between four and six hours depending on their play style. It took me a little longer as I alt-tabbed to make comments for my review. It includes Steam Achievements that are missable; I'm not really fond of these in point-and-click adventures, which inherently have very little replayability. I don't think I'll bother going back and replaying the game just to pick up the achievements I missed.\n\n[h1]PROS AND CONS[/h1]\nPros:\n+ A crazy sense of humour\n+ A generally likeable protagonist\n+ Puzzles make sense\n+ Fully voiced\n+ Good graphics\n+ Achievements and Trading Cards\n\nCons:\n- Some voices aren't the best\n- Relatively short\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\nParadigm is a well-made and enjoyable comedy point-and-click adventure game. Fans of the genre who also appreciate puns, bad jokes, and pop-culture references should definitely pick it up.\n\nSuper Save\n[h1]Save[/h1]\nSave for Later\nPause\nQuit\nRage Quit\n\nNote: I received this game for free for review purposes.

This isn't because it involves some grand journey involving dozens of playable characters, and it's not because it tells an epic story that will be passed down through generations. No, it's because it's completely silly and - more importantly - extremely funny. Most of the comedy adventures that I've played, no matter how good they are, barely raise a smile, but Paradigm had me laughing on a regular basis. Of course, this all depends on your sense of humor, but I'd say if you like your humor less anodyne you'll probably enjoy it.\n\nYou play as Paradigm, a guy with no nose, bulging eyes, and large tumors on his head. But you'll quickly learn that he has a heart of gold, and more importantly a dry and witty view of the world. This isn't particularly a puzzle-heavy game, it's more a case of exploring the bizarre town of Krusz and interacting with its insane inhabitants. Don't get me wrong, there certainly are puzzles, and you'll be combining things from your inventory and interacting with the world plenty of times, but the learning curve is quite gentle, and the developer never lets a puzzle get in the way of a good joke. Literally everything that you can interact with (and there are plenty of interactables on each screen) can be examined, spoken to, used or picked up, usually with comic effect. There aren't any cat moustach puzzles here, it's all pretty logical, but does require some thought towards the end.\n\nThe artwork is excellent, a detailed, hand-painted style that's often intentionally grotesque, and often quite funny with visual jokes scattered around. There's also great attention to detail everywhere, lots of little cool and unexpected things that happen as a result of interactions that show just how much work and passion has gone into this thing. The music is excellent, often sounding like something from Boards of Canada's back catalogue. That's when you're not listening to phat beatsies (and you will). The voice work is also impressive, not a dud performance anywhere. Released in the same week as Thimbleweed Park, you might think Paradigm could get overlooked, but it shouldn't. Frankly, I think I enjoyed this more.

Be warned, I did back this game on Kickstarter and my visage can be found hanging out with some real cool backers. If you feel that this review is thus hopelessly skewed beyond credibility, feel free to rage quit this review, uninstall Steam and delete your Facebook account to emphasize the point. I promise to feel the full wrath of your anger and then remind you I'm a tenured professor so I truly don't care. Oh, and you still owe me that homework assignment. Oh, I also played the game in beta so this review is out so quick based on that beta playthrough.\n\nBack to Paradigm. Paradigm is the least likely hero you are likely to encounter unless you hang with genetically mutated guys with low self esteem issues living in a deteriorating nuclear power plant. Can you keep the plant intact? Can you help Paradigm with a sentient eggplant that owes him rent? Will Paradigm survive his encounter with a guy who clearly is not  a drug dealer? These and other quests await you as you just try to get some sweet mix tapes made. \n\nParadigm is one of the most original adventure games I have ever played. The puzzles range from easy to hard but there is a hint system (that literally is a little voice in your head) and there is always the helpful dog tutorial. Whoever thought up the word \"quirky\" might have had some idea that Paradigm would one day come along. This game is good fun, more than a little crazy and well worth the effort. There are the ever present inside jokes that seem to be so in vogue with modern games but they generally work and if you don't get them, no real harm done.

It's like seeing your friend's new born baby 9 months after watching them have sex, truly emotional stuff. The gameplay is nothing particularly special. You have 4 ways of interacting with nearly every object in a scene, and half the fun in this game comes from using every one of those interactions on the individual objects and characters just to hear Paradigm say something funny. The jokes don't always hit, but when they don't I can quickly click on the object again and hear Paradigm use a pick-up line on a literal crack in a giant metal butt. As you can see I don't have too much time in this game yet, that is mostly because I played the demo so much, which lets you fully explore the first 2 areas of the game; the inside and outside of Paradigm's room, that I went as fast as possible to the new areas. Most of my play time after that has been devoted to interacting with every tiny, unimportant object because I cannot get enough of Paradigm's sexy pickup lines.\n\nAfter two years of waiting for this game to be released, I can safely say this is everything promised to me and I love it.

It does this by subverting your gaming experience at every turn, most notably with the last of your four actions: the'pick up' command. Ordinarily, clicking on an unretreivable object would give you something like \"I can't pick that up\" as a catch-all response; in Paradigm, your character will unabashedly attempt to hit on said object, with a personalised pun, every, single, time. This meticulousness and attention to detail encourages the gamer into exploring every corner of the world, and rewards them with some truly cringeworthy pick-up lines.\n\nThe post-apocalyptic setting, in the ficitious Eastern Europe country 'Krusz', results in an absorbing mash-up of contemporary meme culture with a cold-war-era twist, replete with Python-esque accents and a dollop of fair dinkum aussie humour too. The characters break the 4th wall constantly, often to great effect, and whilst the game doesn't take itself too seriously, the story is compelling and deals with some proper sci-fi in a manner akin to Futurama - poking fun at interesting ideas and then pushing them to strange, hilarious places.\n\nParadigm is genuinely laugh-out-loud funny in places, with absurdist, tongue-in-cheek humour and a large dollop of madness. It's impossible for every single line of dialogue in an adventure game to hit the mark, and some of the more self-effacing humour belies a little insecurity about how the game would be received, but the designer needn't have worried as practically every interaction is rewarding, amusing and inventive. The artwork is truly excellent; a really surreal juxtaposition of colourful and macabre which takes inspiration from vintage tech, 80s pop-culture, and retro point-and-click gaming as well as a variety of other unexpected sources. The voice-acting, sound effects and music are absolutely on-point too, providing the game with a well-rounded and immersive feel. Some aspects of Paradigm's gaming experience are so well-crafted that they're like whole games within the game itself - in truth, I'd rather not reveal what they are, because part of the beauty of them is how they unexpectedly appear within the context of the story. The creativity and know-how required, not only think to envisage, but execute these ideas to such a high standard, is hugely impressive.\n\nWhen you consider that this game was put together by a very small team with little prior experience, the quality of the final result is even more astounding. Aside from a few proof-reading niggles, and the puzzles perhaps proving too easy to solve (which connoisseurs of the genre may turn their nose up at), this is a stellar acheivement, and one which surely establishes Jacob and Jonas as shoe-ins for bigger things within the gaming industry in the future.\n\n*4-HR REVIEW* :\n\nI've now played around 4 hours of Paradigm clicking practically everything I can. A lewd, rude, unhinged and very funny homage to classic LucasArts SCUMM point-and-click games - a tremendous achievement thus far with a frankly brilliant level of detail for an independently-produced game.\n\n*ORIGINAL 'FIRST EVER' REVIEW OF PARADIGM THAT ONLY 10/116 PEOPLE FOUND HELPFUL FOR OBVIOUS REASONS (I just wanted to be 'that guy' & post the first review)* :\n\n*You must wait until this product has been released before writing a review for it.* and then...\n*You need to have used this product for at least 5 minutes before posting a review for it (0 minutes on record).*\n ...spoilsport\n\nFirst!\n\n10/10  would wait expectantly with baited breath again.\n\nSeriously, can't wait to play this, and then review the bejesus out of it.", "timestamp_created": 1491410281, "timestamp_updated": 1492093185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.141071", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

un juego que hace que te enganche desde la primera vez que lo juegas y te deja con ganas de jugar cada vez mas.\nModo Normal:En el modo normal empezaras con el armamento mas minimo y para mejorar esto tendras que lanzarte a la torre, tendras que aplastar a los monstruos para asi conseguir propulsion y poder ir mas alto, en tu camino encontraras princesas y diferentes items como pociones , oro y demas cosas que te ayudaran en tu mision, pero a la vez monstruos se haran mas resistentes y con habilidades especiales, al morir en cada lanzamiento te daran oro , este te servira para mejorar cosas como Efectos de Pociones , Armadura , Espada , Cohetes ,etc.Al hacer esto tendras mas vida , mas ataque y tus habilidades se mejoraran.Una vez que rescates a todas princesas y cumplas todas las misiones del modo normal te daran la llave , que se usa para acceder al techo/tejado ahi estara el jefe que te dara una complicada batalla , si sales victorioso podras acceder al modo superviencia en el pondras tus habilidades con los monstruos mas dificiles y aterradores.\nCosas malas:Al juego se le podrian agregar monstruos con mas habilidades y diferentes dise\u00f1os ya que muchos son versiones mejoradas con cambio de color y mas vida y ataque , algo que se puede hacer un poco repetitivo, pero esto no hace que la experiencia se pierda.\nPuntuacion:9.5", "timestamp_created":

However, despite being on the not-so-great Ouya, it played well and was a ton of fun.  So much so that I bought it again on Steam, even with it being the same game.  That\u2019s not something I believe I\u2019ve done very often when you exclude remasters.\n\nKnightmare Tower is a simple game, one I believe first came out on Android and subsequently migrated to every platform that would have it.  The Steam version of course allows mouse control that I think feels a little more responsive than using a controller.  The game itself has you launching yourself up a tower and attacking/jumping off enemies that pop up from below to keep yourself propelled upward as lava (for some reason) chases you from below. You gain gold and rescue princesses that you use to upgrade yourself to go faster, do more damage, and accomplish more in general.  The end goal is getting to the top and fighting a simply designed yet challenging boss.  \n\nIt sounds very basic, and to some degree it is, but it\u2019s a well-polished experience that is still challenging and felt like a much deeper game than it actually was.  It just makes me wish that Juicy Beast would bring more games to Steam given that they are still actively developing them.  If you think you\u2019d be interested in Knightmare Tower but don\u2019t want to shell out the $4 (or whatever the sale price is), there is a Flash version of the game out there \u2013 assuming Flash hasn\u2019t fully died by the time you read this review.  So you can use that to gauge whether you want a more complete version with all the progress that comes with an installation and saves.  Either way, Knightmare Tower is a definite recommendation from me, and I hope the developer has another game planned for Steam sometime in the near future\u2026 maybe Burrito Bison: Launcha Libre (pls)?\n\nIf you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here:\u00a0http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EndyoGaming#curation", "timestamp_created": 1497626838, "timestamp_updated": 1499837285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32030696": {"recommendationid": "32030696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198241864124", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511558646}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0442\u044f\u0433\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0435\u043c, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u044e\u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c (\u0434\u0430, \u044e\u043c\u043e\u0440 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c) - \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0431\u043e\u0441\u0441 \u0444\u0430\u0439\u0442)\n\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430 \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0451\u043c \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0435 \u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u043a\u0438\u043b\u043b \u0442\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0435\u0440\u044b, \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0443\u0439, 86/100", "timestamp_created": 1496011454, "timestamp_updated": 1501205151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31785337": {"recommendationid": "31785337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049819728", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1515788361}, "language": "english", "review": "Since it's only a thumbs up, thumbs down situation, I've got to go thumbs down.\nKnightmare is not totally a bad game per se, but the thing his, it's not as good as the previous game of the brand.

It's a casual game that does not disappoint. It will consume hours of your spare time. When I got an iPhone, I also bought it on the App Store. \n\nToday, I was playing Knightmare Tower on my tablet and I wondered \"I have a Steam and PS4 controller. They both have gyro. That's one big reason they (the devs) would port this awesome game to the PC.\" The only reason that made me wonder if it had a PC version on Steam is because of how the controls are handled in a mobile device- with a gyroscope. So i decided to check it on Steam since most successful casual games on mobile either come FROM PC or port the mobile game TO PC. To my surprise, this game was originally a web game, and it's available on Steam! So i get this bad boy and rush to my PC to purchas and install this game. Waited for a few seconds and there it is, waiting to be played. I turned on my Steam Controller and pushed the Steam button once the game started up and checked to see if there's an action set on the gyro, but sadly there isn't. At that point I pretty much knew the PC game didn't FULLY support any controller with a gyro, Steam or PS4 controllers. But hey, that's the beauty of Steam, you could configure an action to the gyro. So I tried hooking up the horizontal movement of the left joystick to the always-on gyro, played it a few minutes and admitted defeat. The movement wasn't as smooth and controlled with the mobile versions. I really wanted to get used to it but controlling with a joystick is FAR better than using the gyro. I hope the devs could add full gyro support in the PC version. Otherwise, it's still a great game with or without gyro. \n\nI recommend also getting it on a mobile device (especially a tablet) for extra challenge. The gyro will add a little bit of difficulty especially when fighting the boss.\n\n[TL;DR] \n1. Game controls use joystick instead of gyro (if you've first encountered this game on mobile)\n2. No difference in mobile game (again, except for the controls)\n3. Controllers with gyro not fully supported in this game. (however you can us the gyro as movement through Steam if you want to.)", "timestamp_created": 1483785330, "timestamp_updated": 1483785330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29052770": {"recommendationid": "29052770", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982437383", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483682234}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442\n\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044f \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 - \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u044b\u0448\u044c\u044e \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442", "timestamp_created": 1483681989, "timestamp_updated": 1483681989, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28998589": {"recommendationid": "28998589", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971275585", "num_games_owned": 485, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416989798}, "language": "english", "review": "It's short, it's dumb, but it's still pretty fun.", "timestamp_created": 1483512058, "timestamp_updated": 1483512058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28701579": {"recommendationid": "28701579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042023224", "num_games_owned": 885, "num_reviews": 510, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482819141}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud50c\ub798\uc26c \uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ud6cc\ub96d\ud55c \uce90\uc8fc\uc5bc \uac8c\uc784.\n\n\ub0b4\uac00 \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ucc98\uc74c \ubcf8 \uac8c \uc544\ub9c8 \ucf69\uadf8\ub9ac\uac8c\uc774\ud2b8\uc600\uc744 \uac74\ub370, \uc5b4\ub290\uc0cc\uac00 \uc2a4\ud300\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub8cc\ub85c \ud314\uace0 \uc788\ub354\ub77c. \uad73\uc774 \uc720\ub8cc\ub85c \ud314\ub9cc\ud55c\uac00 \uc2f6\uae34 \ud55c\ub370, \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c \uc26c\uc6b4 \uac83\ub3c4 \uc788\uace0 \ub9c8\uce68 \uc138\uc77c \uae30\uac04\uc774\uae30\ub3c4 \ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11c \ucfe8\ud558\uac8c \uad6c\ub9e4. \ud2b8\ub808\uc774\ub529 \uce74\ub4dc \uc5c6\ub294\uac8c \uc880 \uc544\uc27d\ub2e4.\n\n\uac8c\uc784 \uc790\uccb4\ub294 \uc815\ub9d0 \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub2e4. \ub85c\ucf13\uc744 \ud0c0\uace0 \ud0d1\uc744 \uc624\ub974\ub294 \uae30\uc0ac\uac00 \ub418\uc11c \uc544\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \ucad3\uc544\uc624\ub294 \ubaac\uc2a4\ud130\ub4e4\uc744 \ubc1c\ud310\uc0bc\uc544\uac00\uba70 \ud0d1\uc758 \uc815\uc0c1\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub3c4\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub2e4. \ubb18\ud558\uac8c \uad34\ubb3c\ub4e4 \ubc1f\uc544 \uc370\uc5b4\uc81c\ub07c\ub294 \ud0c0\uaca9\uac10\uacfc \uc190\ub9db\uc774 \ud6cc\ub96d\ud558\ub2e4. \ub85c\ucf13\uc744 \ud0c0\uace0 \ubaac\uc2a4\ud130\ub4e4\uc744 \ubc1f\uc544\uac00\uba70 \ud0d1\uc744 \uc624\ub974\ub294 \uc18d\ub3c4\uac10\ub3c4 \uc544\uc8fc \uc88b\uace0. \uc911\uac04\uc911\uac04 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\ub4e4 \uc5ed\uc2dc \uc131\ub2a5\ub3c4 \uc808\ub95c\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub3c4 \uc88b\uc544 \uc544\uc774\ud15c \uc4f0\ub294 \uc7ac\ubbf8\ub3c4 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud558\ub2e4.\n\n\ucd1d 40+30\uac1c\uc758 \uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ud018\uc2a4\ud2b8\uac00 \uc900\ube44\ub418\uc788\ub2e4. \ud018\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ub294 \uadf8\ub9ac \uc5b4\ub835\uc9c4 \uc54a\uc740 \ud3b8. \uc560\ucd08\uc5d0 \uac8c\uc784 \uc790\uccb4\ub3c4 \uc0b4\uc9dd \uc26c\uc6b4 \ud3b8\uc774\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \ubc88 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ub3c8\uc744 \ubc8c\uace0 \uc7a5\ube44\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ub354 \ub192\uc774 \uc62c\ub77c\uac00\ub2e4\ubcf4\uba74 \uc5b4\ub290\uc0c8 \ud018\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc640 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub294 \uc804\ubd80 \ud074\ub9ac\uc5b4\uac00 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4. \uc11c\ubc14\uc774\ubc8c \ubaa8\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c 10\ub9cc\ubbf8\ud130 \uc62c\ub77c\uac00\ub294\uac8c \uc870\uae08 \ub09c\uad00\uc77c\ud150\ub370, \uc774 \uc5ed\uc2dc\ub3c4 \ud480\uc5c5\uadf8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\uc5d0 \uc6b4\uc774 \uc801\ub2f9\ud788 \ubc1b\uccd0\uc8fc\uba74 \ubabb \uae70 \uac83\ub3c4 \uc5c6\ub2e4.\n\n\uc544\uc8fc \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uce90\uc8fc\uc5bc \uac8c\uc784!

Um diese Prinzessinen zu retten, m\u00fcssen wir mit Hilfe der dort lebenden Monster Etage f\u00fcr Etage erklimmen. Wie machen wir das?

Even though it's more likely a mobile game, it's much fun to play on your pc, too (there is a port though, but the controls are weird as you have to move left and right by tilting your phone). The graphics are nice and high-resolution featuring a cartoony style. The game has an ordinary story, where you are a knight that has to release the princess, however, you have to climb a huge tower with evil creatures and many mini-bosses. So far so good. There is a shop system that provides you upgrades at reasonable prices, but once you are done with the main story which doesn't take too long, sadly, there's no need for you to ever visit the shop again.

I hate games like this, VERY MUCH.   However, this one does it right.  I first encountered this game on my Ouya.  It was the first game I purchased on there cause when I played the demo, I knew right then and there I had to have this game.  Years later, I saw it floating here on Steam and decided that it had to belong in my games collection for the PC.  (Yes, I bought it twice.)  Taking another trip down this game was just as enjoyable as it was the first time I ever played it.\n\nGrinding in this game isn't a chore.... it something that you look forward too.  You spend a good part of your time debating on if you should:  A: Quit the game and take a break (or) B:  Go just one more round, to see if you can get those few extra coins to update your character... which may make or break you rescuing a princess on another round.  If you choose B and then have enough money at the end of your turn, you are then faced wth another series of A / B choices on if you want to go just that 'one more round' and before you know it... you've wasted more time in this game than you wanted to.  :)\n\nMy hats off to the developer for this great game.  I have really enjoyed it not once, but twice.  Game is very well made and greatly polished.  The fact that you can get it on the summer sale on Steam right now almost gives you a feeling that you really got away with some time of crime.  I almost feel guilty for buying it so cheap.

Very colorful game, large scale of different enemies, and boss fight is actually quite challenging. Achieving all achievements shouldn't take more than 6-8 hours, and I'm not pro at this game myself.

game is challenging in a way where you dont want to beat the absloute crap out of your controler and not so challenging that you get bored of it really fast.the challenge is around in the middle and its great fun!\n- The monsters are unique and i really like the art style.\n- people always say oh play it on kongregate for free but on my laptop i can hardly run it it has a tiny screen and i dont like the controls with the mouse on the other hand this game for steam is full screen probably the best game i can run on this laptop and has way better controls.\n- once you have completed the main game you can go onto the survival mode which is an endless challenging bullet hell of fun.\n\ncons\n- as you go up the tower the sprites are just the same just different colours\n-there is only one boss( but its still very challenging\n-only 6 acheivments( you might not care about this but im one of them people who really like to get acheivments)\n\nover all i DO reccomend this gme cause its great fun to play and also reccomend you play this amazing game!\n\n\n\n:)", "timestamp_created": 1465918297, "timestamp_updated": 1465918297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

You \"level up\"/\"gear up\" your knight in the shop with money earned and picked up during gameplay, which helps make the game more compelling.\nHowever, it's pretty simplistic but in a way that suits the game decently.\nSince there's only one type of weapon and all enemy attacks (those who have it) deal the same amount of damage, there is no reason for a more \"complex gearing/leveling system\".\n\nWhich brings me to the pricetag. I only bought it because I was looking at some brief fun but most importantly: I had a 66% off coupon.\nI would NEVER consider a game like this (without trading cards) with a pricetag like this when you're done with it after ~5 hours.\nIt may sound harsh, but the reality is I'm not sure if I'm ever going to play the game again after completing it.\nAtleast the developer put in a \"Start new game\" feature which might help in replay-ability.\n\nWhich again brings me to my next point.. as others have already stated, you're not able to rebind the controls.\nYou'll quickly learn them however, and I only found it frustrating once I broke \"zeh purhfect g4m3\".\nYou're able to pause the game with Esc - However, if you want to resume, you have to press space.\nIf you press esc it restarts, and if you press enter you'll enter the shop (or vice versa - Sue me, I can't remember haha).\n\nOverall the game did its trick - I ultimately had fun with it.\nIf you like casual games, with simplistic gameplay and \"level up system\" this might rock your boat.\nThe graphics and animations, in my opinion, are great.\nThe sound/music is also awesome, however there's a slight audio glitch with the final potion making overlap noises if you stack them.\nThe game doesn't crash or anything, it just sounds weird when the second potion is about to wear out).", "timestamp_created": 1462626477, "timestamp_updated": 1462626477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22822187": {"recommendationid": "22822187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020051626", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462757026}, "language": "english", "review": "A very nice and fun little arcade-style game.

You launch yourself up a tower on top of a rocket and then freefall. The goal is to kill monsters to keep you from falling and they boost you higher up the tower. You will break through ceilings after certain heights reached which will rescue a princess and with that tougher enemies show up to bring more of a challenge. When you rescure a princess she will unlock a bonus for you that may show up when you kill the enemies. Stuff like bombs, health, money, and potions. \n\nAfter each time you end your game you will have money to spend in the store to unlock stuff like health, better damage, and better speed boots for example. When you unlock health and damage it will change the look of your sword and armor. Not much but a cool little feature.\n\nOnce you save the last princess you will need to beat the boss.

That's the whole story but I see no better motivation then that, so anymore would have been meaningless. Anywho, that's about the most sense it will make, since as soon as you enter the tower the only way up is through latching on to a medieval rocket ship and further propelling yourself upwards by slashing enemies. It is a very simple game and the only controls are move and attack. Your only attack is a downwards thrust to attack enemies below you which should not be spammed unless you want to miss the monster and fall. Falling is not the end of the world as the rocket ship will catch you but your momentum will be greatly decreased and with lava rapidly filling up the tower it is something you will want to avoid doing even if it causes you to take a hit. Enemies will also fight back by growing spikes on their back, shooting projectiles at you or fire beams at you.\n\nTaking a hit causes you to lose a heart and starting off you have three. They are regained by random enemy drops and they occurred quite commonly. Common enough that dying by enemies wasn't really much of an issue. Go high enough and you will break through a ceiling which changes the ugly bland background to another color as well as makes enemies tougher and have better attacks. Each ceiling you break will net you a princess that will add something to the game like bombs, rare double health drops and a potion shop. Unfortunately it is impossible to win at first no matter how skilled you are. For one  the top of the tower is locked until you complete every single \u201cquest\u201d which are things like killing a certain amount of enemy without taking damage or just collecting a certain amount of money. Another reason is this game is very much designed for phones so you will have to grind for money to be able to attack harder, move faster and to stand any chance of winning.\n\nThere is no surefire way to gain money, it just drops at random via enemies or you can hit a bubble with a floating black monster inside for massive rewards. You will gain next to nothing at the start though so I suggest immediately upgrading your \u201cLuck\u201d skill for better money pick ups. Another way to gain money is to hit a horn that is unlocked by rescuing a certain princess to summon a harmless enemy that will grant a huge reward if you manage to beat it. They are not difficult, just very damage spongy until you max out your sword to deal more damage. Having an item shop does give you an objective to keep progressing so it doesn't get too repetitive but it doesn't really feel like progress, just a \u201cOh great, now I can kill an enemy without spamming the attack button a dozen times.\u201d. Without the item shop the game would get boring extremely fast so it is up to the reader's preferences to decide if that is a good thing or not.\n\nEnemy variety is pretty decent. Most of the same enemies you meet at the start will still be there by the end but with a slight visual change and capable of taking a lot more damage. One of the selling points is \u201cover 50 different monsters\u201d but in truth most are the same as the last monster but can take a bit more damage and may fire a few more projectiles late game. It's not really a big deal though. Being able to tell an enemy from the other so you immediately know how they will attack is very important and something you will have no problem with no matter how far up the tower you go. There is an end to the tower and if you have not completed all the \u201cquests\u201d you will crash face first into a locked ceiling and lose immediately. Once you half-heartedly do finish all the quests you will be able to fight a surprisingly epic last boss. It is a dumb \u201cmeme\u201d boss but the fight itself is pretty good. Once you beat that boss you will unlock a endless survival mode where you meet tougher enemies and can play until you inevitably die. Survival mode also introduces new quests but there is no real reason to do them unless you are low on cash. Once you get far enough into the tower the enemies get way too bullet spongy to the point of the game no longer being enjoyable.\n\nMusic is alright though a few more tracks would be appreciated it since it felt like I was listening to the same song for the entire game. Graphics are cutesy but you do cut enemies in half and guts come out so it may not be something you would be comfortable letting a child play. The humor is pretty funny from the few cutscenes there are. One small thing I noticed while playing which is neither a good or bad thing is that invincibility frames after getting hit last a very short while so after being hit you will likely get hit again and again unless you move out of the way. In the end of the day this is still a solid little title. I did get a few hours of enjoyment out of it and all the micro-transactions that were likely in it have been removed so once you buy it you get the complete experience.

No real story is fleshed out or explained at great length and quite frankly, it doesn't really need any. This is certainly a game that gets by on its charm alone and it does so with a humble air about it.\n\nControls, consisting of a basic three button input scheme, are responsive and allow the right amount of precision needed to succeed (or showcase multiple failures if you become overly anxious). The perfect setup for the type of game Knightmare Tower is, honestly.\n\nThe game's sense of progression comes in the form of a shop accessible at the end of each attempt to ascend the tower. Using available gold earned from previous tries, you're able to upgrade the knight in a number of areas. It's a welcomed touch that definitely helps with certain challenges, although it is entirely possible to finish the game's \"story\" mode without having fully upgraded each area.\n\nAdditional challenge comes in the form of quests issued as you attempt to reach the top of the tower. Some of these are relatively easy to accomplish with little effort (more so if you factor in the upgrade system) but are otherwise a welcomed distraction. Once you're done with the normal mode, you'll have access to the endless survival mode which also has its own set of quests to complete but also features an upgraded set of monsters to contend with. Like all endless modes, the fun factor available here is only limited to how long you can tolerate it before throwing in the towel.\n\nThe art style is a mix of quirky and cartoon-y, showcasing clean lines and (mostly) vibrant colors in an attempt to remain visually pleasing to the eyes.\n\nThe music, written and performed by Belfast duo HyperDuck SoundWorks, is well suited to the game. It's a synthesized orchestral sound that never becomes overbearing and doesn't feel like an afterthought, which is a considerable plus given that the nature of the game warrants hearing the same piece of music looped repeatedly much of the time.\n\nOverall, there's enough content present in Knightmare Tower to warrant a purchase (especially if you're the type who often buys games on a budget) despite its overall short length.\n\nThe asking price may seem too steep for some (especially those who know the game's origin as a Flash title) but if you're able to get past that potential bias toward it, there's always the possibility of picking it up at a discounted price.", "timestamp_created": 1436770389, "timestamp_updated": 1438901560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626431", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16840947": {"recommendationid": "16840947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112961239", "num_games_owned": 521, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480623946}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun game, right?", "timestamp_created": 1435829948, "timestamp_updated": 1436080087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16834488": {"recommendationid": "16834488", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973085265", "num_games_owned": 419, "num_reviews": 260, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475901177}, "language": "english", "review": "the first game i ever got 100% on for achievements on steam. its an amazingly fun game with a very funny ending.great graphics and good music too.hard to put down once you started playing. well worth the price.", "timestamp_created": 1435789938, "timestamp_updated": 1436111226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16786189": {"recommendationid": "16786189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106444148", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432979952}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't feel like reading? Check out our video review here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf9iAqAgX8I \n\nThe popular flash game now has a full release on Steam. Knightmare Tower is a simple concept that is executed with little flaw. It's a game that boasts accessibility, but can still be challenging to experienced gamers. So brandish your blade and fuel up the rocket, we don't want anyone falling down the tower.\n\nKnightmare starts with a simple story; ten princesses have been kidnapped and need rescuing from a tower. The tower is in control of... let's just call him Boss, and his monsters and minions will do anything to keep you from reaching the damsels.\n\nThe gameplay however is quite unique; You are launched from a rocket and propelled into the air. Monsters approach from beneath to attack you, to which you can perform a downward slash with your sword. Slashing enemies propels you further into the air, with the idea of gaining higher speeds and maintaining momentum. Without hitting enemies you will eventually lose momentum and fall in to the quicly approaching lava, causing your run to end. Monsters can also end your run by attacking you and depleting your health. Forcing you to attack monsters as soon as they appear, as opposed to letting them act first. This adds a madness to runs as there can be tens of monsters chasing you up the tower at once. Bouncing off their heads becomes very satisfying and fun. \n\nKnightmare Tower is a roguetype, meaning its broken into runs and after each run you have the chance to spend your loot on upgrades. Such as: better armor that increase your health bar, a better sword that deals more damage to difficult enemies, and potions that can be found during your runs and improve your character in some way for a short  time. This means many runs are needed before having the necessary equipment to take on the boss. There are also quests that can be completed on each run. You have multiple attempts at the same three quests, adding more challenge for players who want it. After each quest is completed, you are rewarded with gold, and a new quest takes it's place. There are dozens of quests in the game to complete, but none feel out of the reach of experienced players.\n\nReaching certain points in a run, will let you break a ceiling, and pass through to the next section of the tower. Higher sections of the castle have slightly more difficult enemies than the lower sections, but become much easier with upgraded tools. Additionaly each ceiling you brake through rescues another princess; who has a special power attached to her. These powers show up in bubbles during runs. When attacked these powers activate and can have varying effects. Some just deal massive damage to enemies on screen, while others summon mini bosses. This changes up the gameplay and helps it feel fresh, even after a few hours in.\n\nThe main game isn't very long, but you would be leaving a lot behind to stop after rescuing the princesses and defeating the boss. You probably won't have all of the gear upgrades, and a survival mode is unlocked after beating the story, with all new quests. There is easily another couple of hours after the main story of things to complete, and many of the Steam achievments demand more playtime. The replayability of this game adequite, and the games design is fun enough that completing a story is somewhat in the back of the gamer's head anyway. This game is just fun to throw on and play.\n\nKnightmare Tower has tight controls, a fluent artstyle, and an addictive gameplay. For under five dollars this is a no brainer game for anyones library.

All the monsters in the game slowly evolve depending on how far up the tower you go, and their models gradually become more sinister but also more detailed.\n\nThe gameplay is very much reminiscent of Burrito Bison (another game I enjoyed a lot but unfortunately is a flash game and not on Steam at the moment), mainly because it was also made by Juicy Beast. It shares similar game mechanics, where you make your way from a point A to point B while defeating enemies and collecting money. You then use this money to upgrade your equipment and thus can get further in the game, and collect more money and repeat. The main twist on this formula however is that in this game you travel up instead of to the right.\n\nThe amount of content in this game is very surprising, as it is a decent price and does not look like much. However, the wealth of interesting upgrades and unique quests will occupy you for hours. The enemies progressively get harder and more plentiful, the death lava at the bottom of the screen rises faster, and the game generally keeps you on edge and stays challenging. There is even a boss fight included in the game.\n\nYou will feel very satisfied when you finally purchase that last upgrade or get to a floor you've been struggling to get to for a while.

With it now on Steam, I feel like I've practically come full circle.\n\nJuicy Beast Studio primarily develop free flash games, with a few ported to mobile devices. Knightmare Tower represents their first title on Steam. Now, before I continue, let me just link you to a post where Juicy Beast explain the differences between the flash version and the Steam version: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/298400/discussions/0/540744475233237784/#c540744475333677807]here[/url].\n\nMuch like the flash version, this one was relatively short to complete. I managed to complete the main game in...I forget...maybe a few hours? It shouldn't take too long to upgrade everything and challenge the boss. Following that, survival mode proved to be a fun, and slightly harder, distraction. Alas, it did feel a bit too short and I finished the main Steam achievements very quickly. I do wish there was more content added to the game.\n\nOh yes, I forgot to talk about gameplay. Silly me. So, there's this knight that uses rockets to ascend a tower and rescue princesses, in order to defeat the boss beyond the ceiling. As he ascends, enemies come to kill him. The knight basically falls down on these enemies to kill them and increase his speed going upwards. If he goes too slow, the lava consumes him. \nYou also gain gold to buy upgrades for your knight, rocket, and etc.. It's imperative that you finish all the upgrades before fighting the boss, which has bullet curtain segments that feels oddly out of place. You don't need to, however. What you [b][u]DO[/u][/b] need to finish are quests (3 maximum per tower run - more are unlocked once you die as the completed quests are removed from the queue) in order to get the key to challenge the boss.\n\nThe game looked and played exactly how I remembered it from my Kongregate days. Oddly enough, while there's now controller support in this game, there's no more mouse support. I'm not fazed by this, however - I use the keyboard.\n\nKnightmare Tower was very fun and very addicting back in my Kongregate days, and the Steam version made me relive those days all over again.\n\n[h1]When to buy[/h1]\nIf you're uncertain of whether you want to buy this game, you can try the free flash version [url=http://www.kongregate.com/games/JuicyBeast/knightmare-tower]here[/url]. If you'd like to support Juicy Beast and earn some Steam achievements, this game will probably last you about 5 hours and has been discounted 50% in the past (not on Steam). So...your call.\n\nFrom the same developer: Check out their [url=http://www.kongregate.com/accounts/JuicyBeast]Kongregate profile and portfolio[/url] here.\n\nYou may add me on Kongregate if you wish - click [url=http://www.kongregate.com/accounts/J3W3L]here[/url]. No guarantees I'll add you back since I almost never go there anymore.\n\n[h1][b]8.0/10[/b][/h1]\n\n[i]This game was previously demoed on the Who's Gaming Now?!

While it's true that there is a free of charge flash version, the one avaiable on steam has been completely rebuilt on the Unity engine. Now, moving on to the acttual review.\n\nKnightmare Tower is an arcade style game. You play a night going up the tower to save 10 princesses and ultimately deffeat the boss at the top of the tower. Seem's pretty bland, right? It would be, if not for the way you ascend the tower is by hitting your enemies with your sword. You basicly fly around at the top of the screen, slowly falling dow until you hit an enemy or dashing straight at them so that you can get up again. It's the type of arcade game where you're gonna keep failing until you purchase the right upgrades.\n\nSpeaking of upgrades. While ascending the tower, you will keep finding stuff that'll aid you in you journey. Bombs that'll deliver a hit to each enemy curently on the screen, horn that will spawn odd, non hostile creatures you can wack down to go up higher and gain some gold and, well, bags of gold. The last one is obviously used to purchase the previously mentioned upgrades. Those are chategorized as: Equipment, Upgrades and potions. Upgrading your equipment will make your rocket go higher, make you able to withstand more damage or deliver it or just make your movement more fluid. Upgrades are less noticeble, but they still help you a great deal! Potions are another item you can find, and upgrading it in the store will keep adding effects to it like speed or damage boost.\n\nThe game features a variety of different foes. From the harmless demons you use as fodder for your sword, to weird, centipede-like things that you can only hit in the head. Some ill shoot at you, others will blow fire, some others will just use spikes to protect themselves. You've gotta be carefull and time your dashes just right to nog get hit. Also, it's important to note that if you dash and hit no enemys you will fall of the tower. A rocket will quickly get you back up, but you will lose a great deal of your speed, wich will leave you vulnerable to the biggest foe of them all. Lava. Lava will start following you if you don't ascend the tower fast enough. It doesn't mess around. If you fall into it, game over, no matter how much damage you can withsand.\n\nSo you've gone up the tower, saved all the princesses and and defeated the final boss. What now, you might ask. Well now, you unlock a survival mode. The tower is infinite in height and the monsters more fierce than ever! This is where the \"endgame\" begins. If you want to squeeze a bit more out of this game, you'll have a lot of fun trying to get into the leaderboards! Now, the monsters in this tower are always the same, and the only thing that changes is their health, spawn rates and the speed of the lava, as you go up the tower. Make no mistake, though, this get's real hard, real quick! \n\nAs for achievements, the game only has 6 of them, wich will propably turn off anyone who look's to bump up their achievement count, but if you're looking for a challenge, you're gonna find it here. Sure, finishing the game and getting everything there is to get in the shop aren't hard achievements, but getting up to 100.00 meters in survival mode? Good luck.\n\nHonestly, I cannot reccomend this game enough. I am having tons of fun with it, and I bet most of you will too.

Unfortunately, at the time of this writing mouse controls are not part of the game\n- The overall length of the main game is only about 4-5 hours, which  is quite short.

The monsters are split apart in a cartoony colorful way, but they are still split apart. I had no problem let my eight year old watch, but anything younger may be sketchy.\n\nDid I make time to complete it?\n\nThe main game was a blast and well worth the time I spent playing it. The game plays like a premium iPad title and it should be purchased with that in mind. It is to be play in short spurts and enjoyed in a few sessions. I found it held my interest enough to complete it, so as I normally don\u2019t complete games that is a compliment in and of itself.

I played it on Kongregate (along with all the other games from Juicybeast, and I loved them all!), and I had no idea it came to Steam. It was on the Summer Sale when I got aware of it. Of course, I clicked immediately.\n\nI first checked if the game gives anything new compared to the flash version. Although it does, finally I decided I don't care, because this is a game that's developers deserved the money.\n\nI really liked all of the new features, I think the combo is a much better idea than that multiplier-anything in the flash version. The new textures for the potions are great (for example, a feather in the potion for the Levitate effect), too.\n\nI found it harder to defeat the boss (which is hilarious) in this game. A lot, actually. But I say it is good, because when I played the flash game, I mostly ended up with the game being beaten and I'm only 60% or so maxed. Now it is a real challenge.\n\nI didn't think that the game has a story, but now I see it does, and man, I laughed so hard at the ending!\n\nThere are one thing which I badly miss from the game, and that is mouse control. And I also have a suggestion: if you could divide up the monster's healthbars somehow so we know how many hits do they take, well that would be great.\n\nI give it 9/10, could EASILY be 10/10 if it had the 2 features I listed one paragraph above.

It's really minimalistic in its controls, but the way it's executed makes it an intense game of skill with a little bit of luck.\n\nHere's a quick look video if you want to see gameplay with my impressions of it. If you'd rather read, just continue below for generally the same thing.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/agdKUVMg00o\n \nNow before I begin, I'll say you can play this game for free online with pretty much all of the same content. But since it's good to support the devs, you can play it on steam with a better resolution, smoother gameplay, and a controller, which is very much worth it. It also serves as a good demo to see if you'd like the game. Now with that sorted, let's continue this review.\n\nSo what is this game? It's about a knight flying up a tower off a rocket and his enemies' face. Why does he do it? Because he wants a harem of princess like any good chap. \n\nOkay, maybe the concept is silly. I get that. But great feeling of progression this game gives is fantastic. Every time you fly up the tower, you amass gold for when you die (and you will die) for the next round when you upgrade your stuff. You can upgrade your sword, health, rocket, potions, luck, and plenty more to give you an edge to make your way up the tower just a little bit farther. Every so often as you scale higher up the tower, you'll reach a princess who will give you a bonus powerup/enemy that'll make your life easier in the next runs. And you'll keep this system up as you fly farther than ever before, encountering harder and more challenging enemies the higher you go.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it. But while it's so simple, it's a ton of fun with great replayability. It's doesn't even grindy at all since the game has no problem awarding you with gold so you can get that next powerup. There's even achievements and quests that give you side objectives for even more gold. It's really a great system.\n\nIf I had anything to ding this game for, it's just how short it is. You'll probably beat the main quest after 2-3 hours. But it does give you a survival mode, so you'll have something to do after that.\n\nBut all in all, this is a solid $4 game. Worth every penny.

There are 4 main worlds, some challenges, and a couple of minor worlds to explore. The primary goal is to collect \"Explorer Medallions\", which are obtained either by simply finding them or by completing specific tasks, minigames, or collecting enough other collectibles. The aesthetic is charmingly simplistic and evocative of the game's genre-defining predecessors. The loading screen art is adorable. \n\nMore than being an easy game, Poi is incredibly forgiving. There is no lives system or fall damage, death returns you to the previous checkpoint minus some coins, none of the timed sections actually pressure you all that much, and if worse comes to worse you can usually just dig in random locations for a while to get health back. I really appreciate this about the game. It's very relaxed, the exploration is the primary focus, and you rarely ever get frustrated. 100% completing the game (not counting NewGame+) will only take about 10 hours.\n\nThe controls feel a bit floaty, it isn't always clear which surfaces you'll stick to versus sliding off of, and some enemies are annoyingly tricky to jump on, but overall it's a pretty fluid gameplay experience. If I had to choose my least favorite thing about the game, it would be that the boss fights are uninteresting, with one boss seemingly cut from the game or never finished.\n\nOverall, while it isn't going to win any awards for originality, I found it mellow yet satisfying.

The controls are extremely frusterating and clunky. The as far as I have seen, they do little to develope the story, which isn't really there. It has moments, but it turned me away before it could get better. Maybe it is just me though. If you like mario 64 esque games, then you might be interested in this game. 5/10\n\nOverview:\nPoi seems like a cute little adventure game where you are tasked through levels to find these adventure medalians. The game starts off talking about how you and your twin love to adventure, but it never really expands on that, it seems like your twin is the there so you have the option to play as a girl/boy. The game starts in this valley where you meet this old man who tasks you with finding these adventure medalians, and once you get it you return it to his ship where he tells you his story about how he was an adventurer etc. That is really all your given, not really a purpose other than to explore, which is fine, but it is a little barebones. My main issue with the story is how unexplained it is, it gave me very little reason to want to explore to find the medalians.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is pretty basic, and reminds me of some 3D mario games, such as mario 64. However the controls are really clunky and frusterating to use. You need to stomp on enemies in the levels, but I find that it is inpercise and you are constantly landing right next to them, only to take damage. However the climbing and movement otherwise is very nice and clean. This game in general is kind of a call back to 90's platforming, however with a little twist on it. \n\nFinal thoughts:\nFor $15 I would not suggest buying this game for the full price, unless you really know that you like this game. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves 90's 3d playforming games, in a cute atmosphere where the only thing you need to do is explore and collect medalians.", "timestamp_created": 1513915397, "timestamp_updated": 1513915397, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551724", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38425443": {"recommendationid": "38425443", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279382610", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513832066}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Es un buen juego pero no tiene nada de reto, es demasiado sencillo, tenganlo en cuenta si lo quieren comprar.", "timestamp_created": 1513666562, "timestamp_updated": 1513925710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38386499": {"recommendationid": "38386499", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972402149", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513454144}, "language": "english", "review": "The art direction may be a bit generic, and there are only four full-sized levels before the final obstacle course, but this game is full of heart, and the devs did a good job giving you plenty of stuff to do.

In one way it's a cool thing as you can approach it your way.

Searching the levels to find hidden stuff is a treat, and the worlds themselves are big enough to feel like a proper place without being so big that they're frustrating to traverse from one end to the other. \n\nUnfortunately the enemy design is either dull or aggravating or both, and the sound and music are similarly mediocre. There's a lot of \"fluff\" in the design, mostly padding out the number of medals with very uninventive tasks, none of which are all that hard to complete (edit: which may be a good thing depending on your preferences!).

This game is a great clone of Mario 64. It controls great, has most of the same movement abilities as Mario 64, and for the most part has fair platforming. With all the options for movement, it follows suit of its inspiration as a great game for speedrunners of the 3d platformer genre.\n\nThe worlds are colorful and large enough that they are fun to explore but do not overstay their welcome. As in any collectathon style game though, there are plenty of things to look for and discover in a level for the sake of completion. Again these collectibles are mostly fair and you are offered a sort of radar to find most of them as you progress. My only complaint in this regard is that one of the collectibles is introduced 1/4 of the way through the game which has you backtracking unnecessarily if you were completing everything in 1 go in the initial worlds and I wish that they had allowed the [Spoiler] Golden Gears [/Spoiler] to be discoverable from the start to streamline the gameplay.\n\nAs far as the game difficulty is concerned, it is a nicemiddle ground game for the most part but for those who finish the game, you are offered the challenge of completing the game again in New Game + mode which has you taking on the game again with only 1 hit point. There are a decent amount of checkpoints throughout levels to make this challenging but not annoying and if you choose to 100% New Game+ like me, it is very satisfying to take on the second set of challenge stages.\n\nAll of this is to say that the game is not perfect. Hitboxes on some enemies feels ever so slightly off sometimes especially on New Game +, particularly the Snakes and Moles. My one other complaint is the awkward mechanics of positioning the first World Boss but this was a minor concern.\n\nOverall, I loved this game.", "timestamp_created": 1503982982, "timestamp_updated": 1503982982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581382", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34537028": {"recommendationid": "34537028", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995902661", "num_games_owned": 541, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503861431}, "language": "english", "review": "A great adventure game and platformer !

There is little in terms of story. You're just there on a flying ship visiting these unique worlds and collecting mostly medallions but also a bunch of other meaningless things. Once you collect enough medallions you unlock new areas in which you can collect some more medallions. \n\nEach world or level is designed in a pretty open way. Most of the areas of the level are accessible at all times the only difference is the things you need to do to fetch a selected medallion. Each world has 7 medallions placed around the world though you can only collect one at a time. Each medallion will put you at the starting location of the level so it's impossible to do certain things along the way - sort of artificially lengthens the game.\n\nCertain quest do repeat themselves between the worlds - like collecting 7 keys to unlock medallion or 100 coins though there is a lot of unique ones.\n\nThe open nature of the levels combined with a bit floaty physics means you can reach certain places in variety of ways. In one way it's a cool thing as you can approach it your way. In another the wall jumping combined with double jump is not as tight as I would like it to be and you can climb certain places in a way that you should not be able to.\n\nBut the game is still pretty fun. Very family friendly and relaxed. Interestingly designed worlds filled with cute creatures. Lots of things to explore and collect.

End of story now get out of the review section and buy the game if you want to kill a good 32 hours collecting things.\n\nokay that's not entirely true so read this instead\n\nPLOT\n\nYou and your sister run away from the city in order to find Adventure. On your adventure to find adventure you meet up with Mario in his mid 80's who asks you to get his sonic ring with ribbons attached to it down from a tall stump due to him being a crotchety old man who can't do it himself. So you jump to the top of the stump, grab his ring and when you bring it back to him he tells you that the ring is called an \"Explorers Medallion\" and they are foudn all over the world. So he asks you and your sister if you want to get on his magic flying whale blimp to find him and since choice matters as much as it did in TellTale's Walking Dead Season 1 in this game, you say yes and off the three of you go to go get the Medallions and save the world or something\n\nYOUR CHARACTER ADN YOU\n\nIt's simple, you got WASD Movement, Space Sar jumps, pressing it twice duble jumps, pressing Space while sliding down a wall wall jumps and if you time it correctly you can do a triple jump, A roll you can preform by pressing Shift that can be used to kill some enemies and a roll jump you can do by rolling and pressing Space HOWEVER long jumping can only be done after rolling for a little bit and you can't wall jump after doing a triple jump. Later on you get tools and you press E and Q to scroll through them and R to use. Sounds easy, yeah? BuT iTs NoT. Your character only has three hit points to start out with but if you loose all your hearts you'll go right back to the last checkpoint you reached. Luckily bottomless pits don't kill you or make you lose any HP, you just start back at the flag, However, health is extremely scarce unless you have the shovel that allows you to occationly dig up a heart that allows you to get take another hit, an enemy randomly drops one for you to pick up or you can buy a small health extention from Mario so you can take an aditional hit, so you best pray to RNGesus that when you're low on health you can rip out the beating heart of a defeated enemy so you may consume it and gain strength or start saving up so you can buy that extra bit of padding for your fragile child body.\n\nWHAT THE FUCK IS MY PURPOSE?!\n\nIn Poi you gotta collect things. A lot of things. Like, a lot a lot of things. Your main collectibles are the Medallions however    there are also golden gears you need to find so a mechanic can repair her ship and in each world (Plus the Hub and super secret gears) There are 5 total with the exception of the challange levels which have one gear per level and two medalians to be earned, one for playing normaly and another for collection a certian number of keys as fast as you can. Every time you bring five gears to the mechanic she gives you a Medallion and once you have all of them she gives you jack squat except a new line of diolog thanking you for all your hard work and the final Medallion she has\n\n\nThere are also the special locations in every world with a grand total of 16 locations per world, they're pretty easy to spot and chances are you'll find most of them without you even knowing. Once you find every special location in a world the man with the rocketship will give you, you guessed it, a Medallion. \n\nThird, there are 8 fossils in every world (except the micro worlds) The only to extract them from the earth is to buy the shovel from Mario and every time you find all the fossils in a world, some crazed hobo on a floating island in your hub will give you, say it with me now, a Medallion. \n\nOn top of all that there are several minigames and sidequests you need to do in order to get every single medalian, such as the Pin Penguin's six missing babies or the gliding challange where you need to fly through a certian amount of rings before time runs out. For each minigame there are 3 diffaculties: Easy, Medium and Hard, for each one you have to pay a little bit more just to have a shot at and each diffaculty grants you one Medallion (meaning there is aMedallion to be earned for completing each mini game on all 3 diffulcities)\n\nNext are the costumes, finding all of them does not grant you anything special besides changing how you look, giving you an achievement and gettign you closer t othat sweet, sweet 100% completion rating. \n\nFinally, there are the photos. Upon buying the camera from good ol' Mario, you can take pictures of anything in the world but in order to 100% the game and get the achievement, you have to take a photo of every single enemy in the game, that includes bosses and one special NPC that I will not spoil.\n\nOh, and I almost forgot about the stowaway's High Scores. There are 10 of them, they are easy to top and it's pretty much just free Medallions she's giving away\n\n BOSSES\n\nThere are four of them, and each of them are pretty easy\n\nBoss one is Mr Octopuss, all he does is try to pimp slap you with his hentai grabbers that are really easy to avoid and duck under the water. Wait for him to get into position, hit him with a soccer bomb and the world is done.\n\nBoss two is just the leader bully from Super Mario 64 but instead of S H O V E I N G him off the platform you get on a rising platform, monkey bar your way over until your on top of him while avoiding fire stalks, drop down and repeat two more times before clearing the world.\n\nBoss three is just boss one again except he's a mole who makes crystals fall vrom the roof of a cave, but he's not menecing due to his crystals being patheticly easy to dodge and he gives you rocks to kick in his face. Kick three rocks in his face and he's fucking dead.\n\nLastly, The Finial Boss aka a good kick in the dick is by far the worst boss I'e ever had to fight in all of video games due to the game playshifting from decent platforming and exploration into a shooter where you need to launch bombs onto his crystals while shooting down his projectials. It sounds easy enough but due to how bad the cannon controls it's alot harder than it should be. The cannon is way too slippery for this kind of a boss battle because the boss is constently moving, meaning you'll have to change your trajectory often so you can line your shot up with the crystals on his sholders, chin and head but you can't due to the god awful cannon controls. Not to mention if you manage to shoot off all the crystals, the boss gets to throw a hissy fit and start launching projectials at different angles at you. They don't come in too fast so you have alot of time to react but by the time you hit him three times you'll have to manage shooting down the projectiles and hitting the crystals. I also forgot to mention that i nthis boss battle you cannot get health back, so if you don;t have the health extention chances are you'll have to take down a boss that has 5 hit points while you only have three. And guess what else, if you die you'll have to watch an unskipible cutscene before you get to fight the boss again and it makes me wonder what the developer was thinking when he did that because the cutscene maybe about 2 minutes long if you mash your spacebar into oblivion but that's still 2 minutes I don't want to waste reading the same diolog over and over again.\n\nConsidering there are four worlds plus the micro levels and excluding the final level due to it having only one collectible, that being the end game object that serves no other purpose other than to tell you how fast you finished the game and show people who completed the game the fastest, there are a grand total of 101 Medallions, 50 gears, 32 fossils, 64 special locations, 21 creatures to take photos of, 9 minigames run throughs (Granted you beat every single one on your first try) and 7 costumes for you to find and deck yourself out with.

The inheritance is clear; the level select is expressly stylised after the Mario games. It doesn't attempt the comedic lightheartedness of those titles, but accomplishes a personality for the short satiation of that subgenre.\n\n[u]Optimistic:[/u]\nThe core gameplay of Poi is tight. It's almost as fluid as Super Mario Sunshine (for me, the tightest of the franchise); point-turns and wall jumps are much cleaner than 64, and the inclusion of a double-jump approximates the error-correcting comfort of F.L.U.D.D. to a less-dominating degree. \n\nThe music is [i] very [/i] nice. Specifically, the theme accompanying the first level and the overworld transported me into a cinematic optimism partway between Ghibli grandeur and the green goodness of the Bob-omb Battlefield (and other like-levels). The rest of the levels were not quite as evocative, but damn if in the final sequence I wasn't enthralled anew. \n\nThe overworld is cute as hell. One inhabits an airship in a sea of increasingly-populated floating islands and vessels, and soars between them to a collection of minigames and collectathon objectives. By turning a compass while in the center of the flagship (it doesn't actually have a flag :), the player orients the vessel towards their selected level -- and this just feels [i]so damn right.[/i] It stops feeling so when you realise that you can only turn it within a horseshoe, and the illusion of 360\u00b0 gameworld is shattered, especially in the 20 second commitment to move from one extreme of the shoe to the other.\n\nThe worlds on offer (4 core, two mini-levels, the final sequence and a whole lot of minigame-y tasks) are fun to explore. There's plenty of little secrets that reward attention to detail, and shortcuts that one discovers (and comfortably owns) with satisfying experimentation. Unfortunately, the speed-gaming you learn is never really put to task outside of the speed leaderboards; so unless you've a competitive streak, this is purely going to be for your own satisfaction. \n\n[u]Pessimistic:[/u]\nIn Mario, excluding speedruns, I think the spacing of Star pickups were sufficient that you could tolerate the 10 second celebration sequence. In Poi, this same celebratory visual is present, but the game also features built-in speed leaderboards and frequent sub-minute runs for the Explorer's Medallions (Poi's Stars). After the first few Medallions, each was a pain to watch. \n\nThese Medallions are treated by the game as significantly more of a reward than they are. There's lots of them (101!), and plenty of them are obtained in frivolous ways (again, collectathon sidequests). Despite this, plenty of characters in the gamespace announce their [b] \"nice surprises\" [/b] for completing their requests: invariably Medallions. When you're collecting 50 cogs for a Winry-insert (Fullmetal Alchemist :) so she can repair her ship, it's pretty dull to summarise your accomplishments with 10 darts to the other side of the ship so you can collect Medallions (and watch the full cinematic sequence). There is [b] very little reason [/b] I can think of why the purchasable unlocks couldn't have been partly put here, as rewards for sidequesting, or even powerups included: it could simply have been empowering the magnet, expanding the range of the compass (functionally, a shitty minimap), increasing the speed of the player in the Overworld, additional unlockable costumes...\n\nOn the topic of costumes, this was depressing as hell. There's a sub-level of the ship dedicated to unlockable cosmetics for your character, and I was super-hype to check them out once I'd unlocked it. Heartbreakingly, they're recolours: you can wear blue [i] or [/i] red adventurous short-shorts! You can be painted a zombie-fied green, or a mime-y greyscale! For me, this was disappointment incarnate; the game already doesn't care much for visual clipping (plenty of climbing sequences will make this perfectly clear), so why couldn't I have silly attires: dresses, steampunk costumes, decaying zombie flesh... Hell -- they've already made Cactus, Plant and Dinosaur people that're about the same stature as the player character -- I'm mostly just put off by this featurette.\n\nPlenty of the levels feel like incomplete Unity asset-aggregations. The distant levels in the overworld probably should have been made part of the skybox, and given personality, rather than just be monochromatic outlines of the zones. Some of the areas dispute this, but on the whole, a less than satisfying amount of polish has gone into the background design.\n\nPoi's straddling of speedrunning and classic becomes a bit painful in the context of adventure: you can complete whichever objectives you want, regardless of which you've chosen (for the most part), but once you collect a Medallion you've not gotten (bar the 100 coins for each level), you're automatically sent back to the hub world. One should be able to opt out of this, at least in part; I think the game world would be better for it. Admittedly, as in Mario, some of the levels change to accommodate the Medallion challenges (e.g. boss spawning, Koopa-racing), but I don't think it does either of them many favours to kick the player out of the zone without their approval. :(\n\n[u] TL;DR [/u]\nI enjoyed this game. There's a number of questionable design choices and a lack of effort put into the side content, but there's certainly an entertaining amount of personality, content, and just outright stuff to do. For completionists, expect a grind.\n\nI probably wouldn't have been satisfied at the asking price of $15; I received this in the Humble Monthly and sat on it for a long time. I think plenty of platformer enthusiasts would be satisfied with this purchase at full price, but if you're not a fanatical devotee of the genre and(/or) you're not overly interested in self-improvement speedrunning, it's probably worth waiting for a sale. :)", "timestamp_created": 1499566630, "timestamp_updated": 1499566899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33290239": {"recommendationid": "33290239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136626184", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501429464}, "language": "german", "review": "Sch\u00f6n mal wieder einen klassischen Plattformer zu spielen in dem ich mich an alte Zeien mit einer N64 und einem Gamecube erinnern kann.

One could say it\u2019s downright derivative of Nintendo\u2019s long standing classic. That\u2019s not to say Poi lacks any originality, and I\u2019m not going to argue that a personality doesn\u2019t shine on its own here, but rather, Poi offers a long gaze into the direction Nintendo could have taken Mario instead of clean up duty. Simply put, if you\u2019ve always wanted a pure sequel to Super Mario 64 without any gimmicky gadgets, this is where you want to be.\n \nThe controls are Mario. The movement in the space you\u2019re in mirrors Mario\u2019s. Level design is clearly drawn from that source and built around that movement. But, that\u2019s where the similarities end. Other than the swift, blissful movement of Mario, there are no more nods. Poi has its own characters, story and lore that doesn\u2019t involve rescuing anyone. Just pure platformin\u2019. Seriously, you\u2019re just an adventure kid going out into the worlds. It\u2019s actually kinda nice for a change.\n \nThe worlds and characters aren\u2019t half bad either and there\u2019s certainly a bright charm that carries through to the end. Exploring is fun and rewarding with a smooth challenge. Great for kids, but I do think hardcore fans will find enjoyment here. Poi isn\u2019t as easy as it seems. My only real gripe with this is the ending. Not so much how ends, but what you have to do. It\u2019s not a new thing to platformers, and I\u2019ve never understood why a game that asks you to run and jump everywhere, now has you sedentary and shooting things. I just don\u2019t get it and it kinda kills the rhythm.

It is beautiful and I am sure it is a blast. However there is a real problem with the camera. It is choppy and lags horribly. I have to sit on each platform and fiddle with the camera in an effort to try and get it to face the right way before attempting to jump. The very first level I spent 7 minutes on. I can hardly even use the menu because every like 5 seconds the arrow freezes. I finally had to give up on the first actual level because I was getting no where. The game is absolutely unplayable. I have been searching everywhere for a fix and have seen that other people have the same issue. Yet there is no real solution (or cause it seems). It's not my mouse, it works fine when the game is not up. It's not my computer either. It's the game. None of this would have caused me to leave a review without getting to really try out the game, but I have tried to get help in multiple ways. I posted on Poi's facebook. I know they saw it,  because it's posted...but hidden. I posted in the forums. Nothing. I sent Polyid an email and have heard nothing. With zero customer service or solutions I can't recommend the game.\n\nI want to enjoy the game because it is beautiful and the music is great. It really strikes a nostalgia bone because it is just like the old school 3D platformers. It looks like fun! But because the game is unplayable I can not recommend it. I can recommend that if you do decide to buy it you play it IMMEDIATELY to see if this is an issue for you (because like I said I'm not the only person with this issue). I bought this in Feb and only just played it this week. I had a feeling I would not get my money back but I tried for a return anyways, of course no luck. So for now, I wasted my  money. Hopefully they get around to fixing the issue soon.\n\nEdit: I finally got to play the game! The developer has no idea why the game will not run on my computer. We talked back and forth a bit and they gave me a code to put it on my playstation 4, so know that my review is based off of playing it on that platform. I LOVE this game! It did exactly what I wanted it to do, which is stroke that nostalgia bone. I love the lay out of the \"levels\" too. There are only 4 actual levels in the game, but each level has various tasks you have to complete in each one. Once you have earned enough medallions you get to move on to the next area. There are a ton of collectables to find. There are also a bunch of mini games and challenages in the Sky that you can do to earn medallions and to just have fun doing. Once you beat all the challenges you can do them all again, but they add elements to them. The game jumps considerably in difficulty at the end of it. The rest of the game is relaxing fun. Difficult at times but not super hard. The hardest parts of the game for the most part are finding all the locations and fossils and costumes. The tasks in the actual levels aren't too bad though. So I was suprised when I got to the end and it was so much more difficult. I LOVED it though. It was the fun kind of diffcult. I can't say how long the base game takes to beat, but in 16 hours I think it was I beat the game and collected EVERYTHING. Got every trophy except the beating it on new game+ and the got all the trophies trophy. So it's not a super long game. That works for me though! I'm a mom to a toddler and it has been ages since I had the time to actually play a game to completion. So being able to play this game from start to finish and have so much fun playing it was awesome. I was kind of bummed that you don't find the Master Explorer's wife. I kind of expected her to show up at some point, but I guess we just assume she is dead? Some other aspects of the game that I liked are the music and the graphics. I would have liked to have seen maybe a few more enemies. I'm also a bit curious why only 3 of the 4 levels have a boss.\n\nMy only complaint is that I would like to see them make it a bit more apparent who you go to to get some of the medallions from collecting stuff. I spent a good 30 minutes running about trying to find out who I went to to get my location medallions after I found all the locations. I had no clue I needed to go to the space guy, I activated his mission before I was supposed to on accident though so I may have some how skipped his dialogue. I actually talked to the little girl on the ship for the first time trying to figure that out and found out there was a whole other 10 medallions from tasks she gave you. I had never once talked to her on the ship, never though to. I actually got a kick out of it though because when I looked at her tasks I had already gotten every one except the rolling one. I just had to accept all the medallions from her. I never once rolled the entire game though, the tutorial doesn't tell you how to roll so I...never rolled. So for that I spent like 20 minutes just rolling all over Cozy Canyon once I figured out how to roll. So other than the rolling I spent zero time trying to do her tasks cause I didn't know they were available till I was picking up the one or two items in each area I needed to get to get the trophies.\n\nEnd thing though is that I DEFINITELY recommend the game. It's a ton of fun. Not to mention my son enjoyed watching me play it. I was super satisfied at the end and am looking forward to playing it through again for those last two trophies. I am leaving my original review up though for those that buy it for PC just in case they might have the same issue I did with the moust stalling.

Le moins qu'on puisse dire, c'est que ce jeu est permissif. Il y a v\u00e9ritablement peu de chances qu'il vous traumatise. Outre l'accessibilit\u00e9 des objectifs, l'aventure est facilit\u00e9e notamment par l'absence de syst\u00e8me de vies, le game over \u00e9tant donc exclu, mais aussi par la sauvegarde automatique des objets collect\u00e9s.

Graphics are cute, game play is simple but challenging enough to be fun. Bosses are terrible.\n\nThe graphics and art are extremely simple, better than N64 capability but it is not really aiming to be an amazing graphical experience.  The art gets the job done for the most part. There are few times where the cutesy drawings make it difficult to know what an enemy is and what isn't, but that\u2019s hardly a concern.\n\nGameplay is 3d platformer and it is done well enough, but there are some annoyances. Every enemy hits so hard that you are sent flying back and into the air and the invincibility you get after a hit is so short that once you land you can immediately get hit again. There were times I was blindsided and hit 4 times with zero control. The work around is just don\u2019t get hit. The enemies are simple enough that that is completely legitimate option. Puzzle design could use some work in some places. At one point when reaching the top of some slippery platforming, I was told I needed to go back and hit a button. That\u2019s not fun that is just annoying.  Still though, bad design like that was fairly rare.  While most of the game is hunt and explore style game play, it does fail badly in one respect.\n\nBoss fights are terrible.  The first one you simply have to stand still at a certain place and you will win.  Later, you have to fumble your way through with terrible aiming mechanics.  Luckily, there are only four boss fights. Any more could have ruined this game.\n\nAside from the boss fights, Poi is a solid platformer.  A little easy and not as long as I\u2019d like it but still a very good game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1492775067, "timestamp_updated": 1492775067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31260805": {"recommendationid": "31260805", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969507905", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506095225}, "language": "finnish", "review": "Good game so far!", "timestamp_created": 1492712344, "timestamp_updated": 1492712344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31255091": {"recommendationid": "31255091", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993819327", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501074267}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favourite games now!

The small budget shows here and there, namely in the undetailed textures and the unpolished feel of the character movment, but it's incredibly charming, the level design is solid, and every world is actually fun to navigate and explore.\n\nThat's not even to say the character movement is actually that bad, I just personally felt that it was a little too \"light\" and \"hollow\" and would have preferred the character have a subtle sense of delay to give them some weight, because as it stands it's a little too floaty. There should be some feedback or impact from the character when you land, just enough to give you the satisfaction of a jump, but everything from jumping to running and landing is so instantaneous that it doesn't feel like a person, if that makes sense. That's not to say there's not a time and place for this kind of agility; you're able to double-jump off of wall-jumps which allows you to do some pretty nimble stunts. Quickly wall jumping between two structures to reach the top is never not fun. When you're doing stuff like this, the featherweight feel of the character is responsive and sensible.\n\nLikely due to budgetary limitations, there's very little in the way of narrative throughout the game. You're presented with a brief introduction of the cast when you start a new game and you're off collecting from then on. The characters all have really energetic and positive personalities, which thankfully comes across as more sincere than patronizing. They suit their bright and colorful environment and it helps make everyone very likeable. I would love to see these personalities interact with each other more in the future, if this game is successful. \n\nIn addition to traditional \"worlds\" like you would in find in any 3D platformer there are also several challenges/mini-games that add a change of pace when you feel like you need it. These can be anything from flying through an obstacle course in the sky, to making it through a maze in a desert sandstorm. It's not exactly bursting with content, there are only 4-5 \"real\" worlds and the game is usually fairly easy, but for the price i feel like you're getting more than what you pay for. The quality in design across the whole game is very consistent, which is all you can really ask. If you're the type who likes to speedrun, there are online leaderboards for every objective in the game. \n\nCollectathons are still just as fulfilling as they ever were when they're actually done right, and Poi's flavor of picking up yellow objects is pretty damn addicting.", "timestamp_created": 1492078352, "timestamp_updated": 1492078352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537815", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31092832": {"recommendationid": "31092832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007057918", "num_games_owned": 456, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486482603}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great!

with it comes everything [b]bad[/b] with it.\n\n[h1][b]Game Review[/b][/h1]\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n\nNot to start this review off on the wrong foot, but there are a LOT of bugs in this game. Some good, some REALLY ANNOYING.\nUsually people read reviews to learn why they shouldn't buy a game, rather than why they should. Scroll a bit lower for the \"good\" things about this game.\n\nTo start off: Sometimes your button inputs dont connect and you miss a double jump, or better yet, you slid off a very miniscule edge and that [b]was[/b] your double jump.\nEnemy hitboxes are [b][u]absurd[/u][/b], to the point were you're more likely to get damaged trying to kill them, rather than just running past them. Rolling into them has a very small \"hit\" time, so at the end of your roll you'll get damaged if you miss-time it. Infact, theres a lot of points where you roll into them, kill the enemy, and you still get damaged.\nOn top of all this, a lot of the world edges are easily abusable by slide-canceling(?) on and off to get to a lot of out of reach objectives.\n\nKeep in mind, it's an indie clone of SM64, so this includes SM64 camera angles and control. There are some very small segments in the game where the camera just goes ballistic.\n\n[h1]Let's just say, anything enemy based isn't this games strong point.[/h1] Bosses are pathetic or rng. The final boss has incredibly hard to dodge attacks and it attacks way too inconsistantly compared to what you're supposed to be doing.\n\n[h1]BUT THATS OK.[/h1]\n\nThe game is clearly meant to be a kids game, and from my perspective, it excells at it.\n[spoiler]In its platforming.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]The REALLY REALLY Good[/h1]\n\nThere is a plethora of things to collect. [b]A lot of them[/b].\n\nThe in-game checklist is pretty above average, with [u]101 medallions, 50 golden gears, 36 fossils,[/u] and ton of locations to find in each of the 4 stages. Theres a couple of minigames and challenge stages too. It's a completionist's paradise. It's a fresh new SM64 to collect. Every levels medallion has a leaderboard accompanying it, [u]so if you're into speedrunning platformers for times that dont mean anything in a childrens videogame[/u], this is probably for you.\n\n[h1]The music is really good, and the level designs are,[/h1] Well... above average. Though they are very fun to platform around.\n\nThe entire thing is a charming and fun game to play on a weekend afternoon if you want some collect-a-thon action.\n\n[h1][b]Achievement Review[/b][/h1]\n\nThe only achievement you have to go out of your way for, outside of 100%'ing the game, is [spoiler]NG+[/spoiler].\n\nWhile it sounds like it'll be easy, its... medium. [spoiler]Youre given 1 health and have to play the entire game again, mirrored.[/spoiler]\n[u]You dont even have to 100% it again.[/u]\nA lot of the difficulty comes from the final boss who, as I've said before, is really obnoxious.", "timestamp_created": 1491599292, "timestamp_updated": 1491599850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657900", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30985483": {"recommendationid": "30985483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198370038748", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493055640}, "language": "dutch", "review": "Goed spel.

I will start off by saying the developer was really kind and helpful. I had a couple bugs where achievements/NPC weren't activating and I got a super quick response. So cheers to him and his support. \n\nWhile I did enjoy this game and am really happy to have played it through, I didn't completely fall in love as I was hoping. A lot of my enjoyment factor was nostalgic if I'm honest. I'm a huge lover of old school platformers like Super Mario 64, Sunshine, Banjo-Kazooie, etc. So playing a new game on Steam with very similar elements was really cool and reminded me a lot of playing the originals growing up. What I think Poi lacks in is memorable characters or story. There's nothing that really sets it apart from the platformers already out there. It's very simple in difficulty, design, music and overall gameplay. It relies a lot on collecting items, perhaps [i]too[/i] much since it constantly pulls you out of the game to reward you with medallions. I'd want to explore the map and just [i]play[/i], yet it forced you to do whatever medallion quest you were on (that was very straightforward) which made exploration feel more tedious than it should've been. I spent a lot of time wandering, messing around and exploring...just to have to go back and play exactly how the level was designed to be played. \n\nThose complaints aside, it was a fun game!

Ich wollte es sofort spielen, habe mir aber selbst diese Pflicht auferlegt: Erst ein Spiel zu Ende bringen, dann kannst du dir ein Neues kaufen. So wartete ich mit Poi noch. Schlie\u00dflich im Januar 2017 habe ich mir Poi \"geg\u00f6nnt\". War es sein Geld wert?\n\nSpielmechanik\n\nIn Poi springt, gleitet, rollt und schwimmt ihr durch die Welten von Poi. Wie sein gro\u00dfer Vorbild hat man verschieden Wege sein Ziel zu erreichen. Ob \u00fcber mehrere Plateau\u00b4s, oder einem ge\u00fcbten dreifach Sprung (mit entsprechenden \"Juhuu\", gleich einem Klempner) erreicht man mit ein wenig Geschick die Spitzen der T\u00fcrme, Windm\u00fchlen oder Berge. Als einer der wenigen 3D \"H\u00fcpfspiele\" nutzt Poi sein Potzential nach oben aus. \nLeider fallen weitere Aktionen kurz, man kann nicht in die Tiefe tauchen, oder Gegner festhalten, bzw. boxen. \nWas ich auch schade finde, dass die Spielmechanik nicht durch interessante F\u00e4higkeiten erweitert wird (\u00e4hnlich der M\u00fctzen). Allerdings hat man wiederrum die M\u00f6glichkeit Forschergegenst\u00e4nde zu kaufen, und diese in den verschiedenen Welten zu nutzen. Diese Gegenst\u00e4nde schmiegen den Spielfluss eher an den eines Zelda, als an ein Mario. Ich fande diese Spielereien ganz nett und haben auch das \"Entdecken\"-Thema gest\u00fctzt, h\u00e4tten aber noch spielrelevanter sein k\u00f6nnen.\n\nSpielgr\u00f6\u00dfe/Spielwelt\n\nIch kann mich nicht mehr daran erinnern, wie viele Gem\u00e4lde man in Mario 64 insgesamt besuchen konnte.  Poi hat 4 elementare Welten. Damit f\u00e4llt es wesentlich k\u00fcrzer aus. Allerdings kommen noch viele kleine Bereiche hinzu, die entweder als Herausforderungslevels gekennzeichnet sind, oder anderweitig zum Entdecken einladen. \nPoi gl\u00e4nzt zwar hier nicht durch seine Gr\u00f6\u00dfe, aber durch seine kreative Oberwelt. Man startet immer in seinem Luftschiff und steuert  mit einem Steuerrad die Welten an. Nach einer gewissen Menge gesammelten Medallions kommen weitere Luftschiffe und fliegende Inseln hinzu, die alle eine andere Funktion erf\u00fcllen. So wird man in den ersten 3 Stunden nach und nach \u00fcberfl\u00fcgelt und \u00fcberh\u00e4uft, dass man gar nicht wei\u00df, wo man weitermachen soll.\n\nViele dadurch eingef\u00fchrten Charactere schicken einen aber wieder in die altbekannten Welten. Das ist nicht unbedingt repetitiv, da teilweise neue Areale freigeschaltet werden. Generell sind die Welten sehr dynamisch. Je nach Aufgabe werden neue Zug\u00e4nge frei oder es treten neue Herausforderungen auf. Poi hat zwar nur vier Welten, diese reizen sie aber aus, ohne eine Ubisoft Manier an den Tag zu legen. \n\nIch h\u00e4tte mir dennoch  mehr Welten gew\u00fcnscht.\n\nSound\n\nDie Titelmusik ist wirklich wirklich gro\u00dfartig und einzigartig. Hut ab. \nDie anderen Sounds und generell die Hintergrundkulisse werfen sich auch von der Instrumenten und Synthesizerwahl an den Italiener. Ob W\u00fcste oder Schneelandschaft, die Einfl\u00fcssen sind \u00fcberall zu h\u00f6ren. Ist ja nicht schlecht. Anderseits gibt es auch eigene Sounds. Z.B., wenn man auf dem Ballon des eigenen Luftschiffs umherwandelt oder stirbt. \n\nGeschichte\n\nEIn Forscher bittet dich, ihm beim Forschen zu helfen. Es gibt keine Prinzessin zu retten\n\nFazit\n\nPoi bietet einiges f\u00fcr seinen Preis, f\u00e4llt aber doch recht kurz aus (Knapp 10 Stunden). Positiv sind die kreative \u00dcberwelt, der gef\u00f6rderte Entdeckungsdrang und die 3D H\u00fcpfspielerfahrung (Sonst gibt es doch nur 2D Spiele, oder?). \nNegativ f\u00e4llt mir auf sind der etwas zu geringe Aktionenreichtum, die kleine Weltenvielfalt und die fast durchweg langweiligen Bossk\u00e4mpfe. \n\nDa aber ich als purer Nostalgiker auf meine Kosten gekommen bin (Pinguinmamas helfen, an Gattern entlanghangeln, auf K\u00f6pfe springen, \"Juhuu\" beim dritten getimten Sprung h\u00f6ren, Eisrutschen rutschen, Charaktere in der Welt treffen, die dich herausfordern und sich immer \"nur\" den Hintern in der Lava verbrennen) gebe ich den Spiel einen Daumen nach oben.\n\nAchja, das Spiel geht vom Schwierigkeitsgrad in Ordnung", "timestamp_created": 1489949900, "timestamp_updated": 1489950473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30621105": {"recommendationid": "30621105", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313636156", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505935501}, "language": "french", "review": "Je pense sinc\u00e8rement que la chose qui manque dans ce jeux est le coop local ou en ligne, tellement de possibilit\u00e9 s'amusement si il l'ajoute.Pour un jeux comme sa cela ne doit pas \u00eatre trop difficile...", "timestamp_created": 1489946628, "timestamp_updated": 1489946628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30603689": {"recommendationid": "30603689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305523040", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505517263}, "language": "english", "review": "Its good\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1489882098, "timestamp_updated": 1489882098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496786", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30517545": {"recommendationid": "30517545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321434532", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489955891}, "language": "english", "review": "Really solid 3D platformer. It's a throwback to the 5th & 6th console generation collect-a-thon platformers, like Banjo-Kazooie, or Mario Sunshine (albiet a little simpler than those games). The graphics are very good for an indie game that's 15 bucks. The environments are lovely, and overall charming. The level design is quite good solid as well. The music is catchy and relaxing, but it can be a tad repetitive (not enough to ruin anything). The controls are also quite good (the camera can be a little frustraiting, see below), and the platforming is excellent (minus the minor camera issues). I also really like how coins aren't inhernetly useless in this game (like Mario 64 for example), which incentivizes you to collect them. \n\nI really only have 2 complaints...\n\n1. The camera can be a little frustraiting. You can move around the camera freely. But, once you move the character, your camera immediately pans back to it's original orientation. This can cause problems during specific platforming segments. So you need to slow down, and even come to a complete stop just to re-adjust the camera to make a jump. Rinse and repeat. But this is only a case for very few segments of the game. So it's really not a big deal.\n\n2. The hit detection a little wonky. Your character feels a little \"floaty\" and doesn't have a lot of weight. So when you jump to stomp an enemy it's hard to predict where you'll fall, which causes missed jumps and get hurt by enemies (and for a good portion of the game, you only have 3 hearts, so if you're facing a lot of enemies, a missed jump can lead to insta-death). You eventually get used to it, but it's something I hope the developer works on.\n\nI do not think these negatives inhibit the game playing experience though. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the 3D Platforming/Collect-A-Thon genre. Or even for someone who is looking for a relaxing game to take the edge off. I hear a lot of complaints that it's too short, but for a $15 indie game I think the length is fine. It also may seem \"dated\" to some, but I think having a callback to a classic style of game is always welcome. Especially when it's done right. \n\nFinal Score: 8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1489540958, "timestamp_updated": 1489672361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30491826": {"recommendationid": "30491826", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994378716", "num_games_owned": 448, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489416802}, "language": "english", "review": "I desperately want to love Poi, but it just won't let me. I see a game that looks like a love letter to Mario 64 and the opening impression I had is that they did a bang up job, but the further I go the more frustrating all the little problems are. I really started to have a problem when I hit the octopus boss of Cozy Canyon. I've never been so bored and annoyed during a boss fight. I tried standing around waiting for the boss to come to me. I tried chasing after it. Ultimately I got sick of trying to I just left my character stood over the bomb spawn just kicking them in front of me hoping eventually the boss would come near enough for me to hit it. After about 4 minutes it did, and I kept hitting it with bombs before it could de-spawn until it died. It was painfully anti-climactic.\n\nOther issues I had with the game include small but similar issues like trying to get my character to latch onto a climbable grate except even pressed right up against it they wouldn't re-orient themselves and latch on. So I just fell to my death while pressed against the climbable surface. The lack of i-frames can also be a problem. At least early on none of the enemies pose any real threat, unless you happen to get caught in a corner with one and they trap you in a loop where you can't recover and simply die. I don't imagine that happens often, but it was quite vexing the one time I had to put up with it. Overall it just gives the impression of a game that desperately needs more polish. My last issue is the camera, anytime it forces a perspective on you the game becomes instantly less fun to play. There's a section where you need to climb a rotating spiral of increasingly taller platforms and the forced perspective makes it more of a hassle than it needed to be.\n\nIt sounds good, it looks good, and when you're just platforming or interacting with the games pleasant characters it's a very fun time. The whimsical tone of the game is just severely undermined by some very clearly rushed sections and minor issues that could probably be fixed fairly easily. I sincerely hope Polykid isn't done with this game and they come back to tighten things up a bit and maybe liven up any set pieces like that Cozy Canyon octopus boss.

Si bien es cierto que el juego puede llegar a ser bastante simplista, no digamos en cuanto a historia, que resulta b\u00e1sicamente nula, al menos intenta por todos los medios parecerse a las fuentes en que se inspira. Tarea que consigue pero solo a medias, est\u00e1 bien, pero con algo m\u00e1s de ambici\u00f3n podr\u00eda haber sido un t\u00edtulo redondo.\n\nComo plataformas, lo que prima es la jugabilidad, el control sobre el personajes, en este caso, un \u00fanico protagonista (podemos elegir chica o chico) y es una de las notables diferencias con otros juegos, solo uno con habilidades limitadas, saltos por plataformas, correr y rodar, no conseguiremos nuevas habilidades aunque vayamos completando el juego, este es un aspecto que podr\u00eda haberse potenciado. En contraposici\u00f3n, tenemos algunos art\u00edculos para hacer m\u00e1s cosas: fotograf\u00edas, explorar con m\u00e1s eficacia, excavar f\u00f3siles. A pesar de las diferencias en los escenarios, siempre hacemos lo mismo, por ejemplo en Banjo-Tooie ibamos consiguiendo habilidades para obtener piezas de los puzzles innacesibles al principio, aqu\u00ed no pasa eso.\n\nLos escenarios son coloristas y bonitos visualmente hablando, con las t\u00edpicas plataformas por todos lados, no son demasiado complejos, pues casi todo lo que hay que hacer est\u00e1 m\u00e1s o menos a la vista y no habr\u00e1 que recorrer grandes distancias, no innovan en absoluto, los hemos visto mil veces, el t\u00edpico bosque, cavernas heladas, volcanes, los t\u00edpicos escenarios de los plataformas. Adem\u00e1s no es que supongan un desaf\u00edo completarlos, es f\u00e1cil recorrerlos y dif\u00edcil frustrarse en estos, cosa de agradecer. Poco a poco iremos abriendo nuevas zonas con los medallones, el objeto m\u00e1s importante en el juego, que nos los dar\u00e1n por completar las t\u00edpicas micromisiones de estos juegos, conseguir otros coleccionables o realizar acciones dentro del juego. Es interesante recogerlos todos pues el mundo se ir\u00e1 ampliando con peque\u00f1as subzonas, niveles de desaf\u00edo o nuevos retos. Todo desde nuestra base con el barco volador en el cielo.\n\nLos enemigos en casi ning\u00fan momento suponen un reto pues su \u00fanica aportaci\u00f3n es la de estorbar, la \u00fanica dificultad es saltar sobre ellos pues debido a la perspectiva puede ser desesperante a veces; en cuanto a los jefes finales, hay unos cuantos, pero que tampoco suponen un reto, una vez descubierta la manera de da\u00f1arlos, bastante simple, bastar\u00e1 con unos tres golpes para acabar con ellos. Los personajes que aparecen en el juego son meros espectadores que acuden para decir un par de frases o entregarnos alg\u00fan medall\u00f3n.\n\nComo advert\u00eda la salsa del juego, las plataformas, no son complicadas, exceptuando alg\u00fan lugar donde deberemos tener precisi\u00f3n es las esquivas y andar con delicadeza, es f\u00e1cil sortearlas, los saltos no deben ser milim\u00e9tricos para poder superarlos; los coleccionables son engranajes para lograr medallones, f\u00f3siles enterrados en los niveles y localizaciones que debemos encontrar, luego las misiones de desaf\u00edo hasta llegar al medall\u00f3n objetivo, con rankings mundiales, y retos que nos proponen y otras con tiempo limitado.\n\nLa m\u00fasica refleja el esp\u00edritu jovial y ameno del t\u00edtulo, con melod\u00edas frescas pero que a veces se vuelven repetitivas, los efectos sonoros tampoco destacan demasiado. Los v\u00eddeos est\u00e1n realizados con el motor del juego, comienzan con una historia tipo c\u00f3mic pero solo al principio, luego desaparece este formato. La duraci\u00f3n tampoco es demasiada, pudi\u00e9ndose conseguir todos los coleccionables en unas 10 horas, eso para un plataformas es poco.\n\nEn definitiva, un t\u00edtulo que pretende emular la f\u00f3rmula de aquellos cl\u00e1sicos de N64, en parte se parece, pero si hacemos comparaciones pierde mucho con los t\u00edtulos de Rare, a pesar del tiempo transcurrido. Este juego se mantiene en una posici\u00f3n demasiado conservadora pues no innova en absoluto, aunque eso no quiere decir que no vayamos a disfrutar el tiempo que juguemos a Poi.

While I think that seasoned genre veterans will get the most out of Poi, it is also suitable for people who are not very familiar with the classic games that inspired it, as it is more on the easy side of things difficulty-wise.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[h1] Introduction [/h1]\nThe year 2017 pretty much looks like a sort of renaissance for the more open-world-style 3D-Platforming  [i] \"collectathon\" [/i] subgenre that was most prominent in the 90s (think Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie): With games like [i]\"Yooka-Laylee\"[/i] and [i]\"A Hat in Time\"[/i] arriving in the near future, both of which possess a lot of internet popularity for a very long time now, without even being released yet, it was a real surprise for me to see another 3D-Platformer very sneakily entering the steam store earlier this year; and this platformer was of course Poi. \n\n[h1]Overview/Story [/h1]\nSo the game tells a pretty simple story about two kids that go on an adventure to find a legendary treasure called the \"Milky Way Globe\". You thus play as one of the kids (boy or girl) and explore four big worlds and a good number of smaller ones, trying to find as many of the main collectibles (which are called explorer medallions) as possible, since they enable you to unravel the mysteries of the \"Milky Way Globe\". The story is indeed rather forgettable here and just gives you a reason to explore and collect stuff, but this is fine in this context.\n\n[h1]Graphics/Visual Design (8/10) [/h1]\nThe visuals are pleasing to look at and very colourful. I especially like the various day/night cycle and weather effects in the different worlds. Animations are pretty smooth and you can see with smaller details like the balancing animations of the player characters that there was put a lot of effort into this matter.\n\nThe artstyle of the game is very coherent as a whole, and also for every world: Each area has its own group of quirky inhabitants that fit nicely into each environment. I do would have wished for a bit more personality regarding the world design, however: The themes of the worlds and most of the human characters in the game felt pretty generic to me in comparison to other games in the genre. Only the quirky inhabitants I mentioned above really seemed to have an interesting personality of their own.\n\n[h1] Voice/Sound/Music  (8.5/10) [/h1]\nSound is super solid here, I like most of the sound effects here, with the exception of the sounds that the player characters make when jumping/rolling etc.; these got a bit annoying soon for me, but it is only a minor complaint for me.\nThe music is fully orchestrated, which is always nice for me, and it always fits the atmosphere of each world pretty well.\nCatchy themes that I would expect from such a title were often missing. Don't get me wrong here: The music is definitely good here, but not quite great.\n\n[h1] Gameplay (8/10) [/h1]\nExploration of the worlds is pretty engaging due to good leveldesign throughout: You constantly discover new things that you can check out and even in the hubworld is constantly new stuff popping up. This is what Poi nails expertly; the exploration and constant unlocking of new content is really a delight.\n\nPlatforming feels very nice aswell, all classic 3D platforming moves are here and the controls are tight, resulting in enjoyable platforming sections. It is also possible to earn a number of gadgets in-game that enable your character to dig soft patches of earth, shoot photos etc. These are a nice addition to the gameplay.\n\nCombat, however, is super simple, too simple in my opinion. I mean, it doesn't have to be super complex in a game like this, but defeating enemies only revolves around jumping on them for the most part, which is actually fine for the smaller enemies in the game, but the absence of any other combat move (e.g. a punch or a kick) limits enemy design too much in my opinion. This especially shows with the boss fights, which are a weak point here for me; they weren't really that fun to fight, but luckily, they are also not long and not too frequent. The combat is of course not the main focus of this game, but I still would have really liked to see better boss fights here.\n\nThere is really a lot of stuff to collect and find in this game, but most of it can be found/done pretty fast and easily, resulting in a 8 hour playthrough for me to reach the 100%. There is also a new-game+ mode that is unlocked by beating the game: However, it was of no interest for me, as [spoiler] it mainly increases the combat difficulty by reducing your health bar to 1, while the locations of the collectibles remain the same (the worlds are mirrored though). [/spoiler]. \n\nThe content is thus perfectly fine for the price of this game, I, however, found the game to be too easy and when things finally got really interesting for me in the last world, the game soon ended. I albeit have to admit that I am very experienced in this genre, for inexperienced or many casual players, this thus may prove to be no problem at all.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nOverall, I enjoyed my time with Poi, and, considering the fact that 3D-Platformers are very hard to make, the guys from PolyKid did a formidable job here with presumably only few resources available. I really think that this game should get more attention and I would like to see DLC or a sequel here.\n\n[h1] My Overall Score: (8/10) [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1488986949, "timestamp_updated": 1488987229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512555", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30363709": {"recommendationid": "30363709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003970062", "num_games_owned": 1154, "num_reviews": 213, "playtime_forever": 841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488840674}, "language": "english", "review": "Poi is a 3D platformer which is reminiscent of the platformers of the mid to late 1990s in many ways. Unfortunately, while it may imitate the control scheme of some of those games, what it lacks is heart.\n\nPoi has a pretty standard control scheme \u2013 you run,  you can double jump, you can roll on the ground, and there\u2019s a triple jump in the game which reminds me of Super Mario 64. You can grab onto the side of platforms and pull yourself up, and there are some climbable grates which look rather like chain link fences.\n\nThe controls are okay, though they always feel ever so slightly awkward, likely because of the camera, which in many ways also feels like it is from the 1990s. The camera doesn\u2019t really feel very good, and at times forced camera angles make seeing what you\u2019re doing a bit awkward. You always feel a little bit slippery, a problem some of the older 3D platformers had, and it is annoying to jump on enemies\u2019 heads at times and sometimes hard to judge jump distances as a result of the controls.\n\nIn terms of the game itself, there are four major world areas, plus a handful of smaller areas that aren\u2019t world-like but are large enough that they constitute an \u201carea\u201d. There are also a number of challenge levels, which are simply platforming puzzles which are fairly arbitrary and show off some central obstacle. There is a gliding mechanic, which you use to navigate the hub world area, as well as a handful of gliding challenge puzzles. According to the in-game timer, it took me about 10 hours to 100% the entire game, and that was with me running around and quite thoroughly exploring the various areas.\n\nSo it isn\u2019t tiny, but it isn\u2019t really all that long, either, and it FEELS small.\n\nUnfortunately, this game falls down in one very major department: it is very bland. Like many of the late 1990s games, this is ultimately a collect-a-thon \u2013 your goal is to collect 101 explorer medallions, some of which are goals similar to the stars in Mario 64, where your goal is to navigate to them or complete some challenge to make them appear, with the level giving you the option of which one to pursue every time you enter the level.\n\nBut this only constitutes a very small fraction of the overall medallions in the game \u2013 only 28 of them, including the ones you get for collecting 100 coins within a level. There are about a dozen more in the smaller \u201cworld-like\u201d areas, and from there, the challenges ultimately feel increasingly arbitrary. There are a pretty large number of them gotten from going to every location in the game, digging up every fossil, and collecting all 50 \u201cgolden gears\u201d in the game (of which about half are found in the world-like areas).\n\n\nUltimately, the game feels very gamey, and not in a good way. The challenges often feel arbitrary, and the levels not only don\u2019t feel particularly organic, but they look kind of unappealing. While each area has a central aesthetic, the game never looks cool at all \u2013 instead, the whole thing feels vaguely cheap, and the game doesn\u2019t really have much of a \u201clook\u201d. The enemies don\u2019t feel very iconic, and the levels themselves are very obviously just set up as a series of obstacles. And while this is true of all games, and indeed, many games like Mario 64 were pretty blatant about it, this game somehow feels more egregious in its gamishness. It is never overly difficult, but whenever I\u2019m going through an area I\u2019m left with the feeling that it is just something someone designed for me to jump through rather than a place, and the challenges almost always have a feeling of artifice to them. The first area of the game feels the most organic, with them feeling increasingly less so over time, and then everything outside of those four worlds feel like they are just entire arbitrary constructs.\n\nIt lacks character. There\u2019s nothing interesting about the characters in it (what few there are), and the game ultimately feels like it lacks any real identity of its own, and instead just feels like a bunch of stuff that was set up to be obstacles for the player.\n\nIt is impressive that such a small team made a game in this day and age \u2013 a fairly sophisticated 3D one, no less \u2013 but at the same time, I\u2019m just left at the end of it with a feeling that the whole thing was a cheap knock-off. I can\u2019t think of a single thing in the game I hadn\u2019t seen before many times, and done better elsewhere, and that makes it very hard to recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1488841926, "timestamp_updated": 1488897328, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619103", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30345038": {"recommendationid": "30345038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027103142", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488745469}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is basically Mario 64 without the Mario characters.

Each main level lets you choose which medal -- i.e., each star in SM64 -- you want to go after, with subtle changes to each level based on what medal you're seeking. The levels are never anything more than stereotypes -- a green, cartoon-y forest; a bunch of desert tropes; a cave full of crystals, ghosts, and industrial tools (OK, that's a bit odd); lava, lava, and more lava. \n\nThe text and 'story' are also built on vague stereotypes and being cutesy for kids (but in a patronizing way, as I'm not sure this team really thought about how to write for anyone). I'll stress necessary airquotes around 'story,' too, as there really isn't one beyond just collecting medals. There's a minor hint of one early one, but it's literally forgotten and never addressed past the intro -- even in the ending.\n\nPoi really isn't as bad as I'm making it out to be.

The boss fighting mechanic is also one of the most annoying things in recent memory. You have to kick things and hit them with them.

I don't think most, myself included, expected this to be the next \"Super Mario 64.\" Its important to look at Poi for what it accomplishes in its own right, even if it can't match the greats that clearly inspired it. But since Poi doesn't really have any contemporaries (yet,) this kind of comparison is almost bound to happen. Trying to give level-headed praise or criticism is almost like trying to walk a tightrope.\n\nAt the end of the day, we should try to like Poi for what makes it unique. A game may not have the same level of quality as its predecessors, but a unique twist or hook that at the very least makes it distinct and enjoyable in its own right. For me, that's what ultimately tilts this towards a non-recommendation. Poi gets the basics down pretty well but by and large struggles to move beyond a gameplay skeleton we've seen several times before.\n\nSo yes, Poi is undoubtedly a 3D platformer collectathon. Believe me when I say the \"collectathon\" is strong with this one and the game plays off the explorer motif rather well. You need to find gears, keys, fossils... all sorts of stuff. At your disposal are several explorer tools like a shovel and compass that you can purchase and a bevy of movement options that will be familiar to fans of the genre. If anything Poi is straightforward and to the point, and if you want a game to just auto-pilot on for awhile Poi can definitely fill that role.\n\nIn general, Poi is pretty laid-back. The simplistic graphics and music are charming and the gameplay pretty chill. Even in death, there's not much to lose since most areas are filled with checkpoints. The game also tries to inject its own personality through the explorer spin, having you scope out landmarks and photograph wildlife to fill out a journal. There's almost always something to do or find and you can explore it at your own leisure.\n\nBut despite the depth of content, there are parts where the execution just feels dreadfully lazy. This goes beyond simply having a lot of the same collectables, which arguably would be expected. Its the fact that the game settles on mundane, cut-out tasks again and again as a means to dispense rewards. Need to wash off the bell? Move this object. Fix the tower? Move this object. Power up the windmill? Again, these fetch-questing and button-pressing escapades are nothing new to the genre, but there is only a thin creative layer over top of it. The collection aspect isn't necessarily the problem here; its the means of collection that can quickly become tedious.\n\nDo the environments themselves help make up for this? Unfortunately, we're definitely in well-trodden territory here as well. Canyons, volcanoes, snowy fields... been there, done that. Its here that the simplistic graphics sort of work against the locales, as they struggle to infuse much-needed personality into the different worlds. I don't recall many times when I looked off in the distance, eager to explore. Particularly in the first half of the game (and there's only about a half-dozen core worlds,) the locales aren't very large or interesting.\n\nHowever, I will give credit where credit is due and say the latter half of the game does step things up a little. The worlds get a bit bigger, and the end-level in particular I found to be a satisfactory challenge (at least compared to the rest of the game.) Again, Poi has the foundation in place... I just feel like it drags its feet a little too much, then ends right when it starts to finally click the pieces into place.\n\nNo doubt Poi is going to find its audience if it hasn't already. In particular, I feel like it would be great for a beginner who is less familiar with the 3D platformer niche. All that being said, I still personally give this a reserved non-recommendation.

Los amantes de las plataformas se sentir\u00e1n en casa. Al inicio del juego relata un poco sobre los personajes del titulo; dos hu\u00e9rfanos quienes comparten el sueno de partir en una aventura y se escapan de viaje con tal de cumplirlo.\n\nCuando el juego da comienzo nos topamos con un personaje parecido al Sr. Miyagi (el cual seguiremos llamando de esta manera) que nos pide ayudarle a conseguir un objeto que es muy importante para \u00e9l. Debido a su edad el Sr. Miyagi no puede recogerlo, asi que es nuestra tarea ir por dicho objeto para \u00e9l. Una vez obtenido el objeto para el anciano este nos contar\u00e1 una triste historia sobre como perdi\u00f3 a un ser querido. Al mismo tiempo que nos cuenta sobre su viaje asombroso en busca de los Medallones de Exploradores, y nos invita a buscarlos  con \u00e9l, dando comienzo a nuestra aventura.\n\n\u201cPoi es una experiencia nost\u00e1lgica plataformera\u201d.\n\nEl juego nos permite usar dos personajes diferentes, podemos ser ni\u00f1o o ni\u00f1a, con el chance de cambiarlo en cualquier momento que nos encontremos en la nave tipo dirigible del Sr. Miyagi. Con esta nave \u201cviajamos\u201d por los distintos mundos o niveles.\n\nSu jugabilidad recae sencillamente en saltar, utilizando la mec\u00e1nicas de doble salto, saltos utilizando dos paredes paralelas verticales para alcanzar lugares mas altos, etc. Los niveles son muy variados, y cada uno tiene su tema especifico, no parecen repetitivos y de verdad se nota un esfuerzo muy grande con tal de hacerlos divertidos.Se puede jugar con mando o con teclado; nosotros lo probamos con mando de Xbox 360 y se siente realmente bien.\n\nLos que jugamos Mario 64 encontraremos en Poi un tributo al mismo, se nota much\u00edsimo cuanto puede amar el desarrollador a la saga de Nintendo. Las mec\u00e1nicas nos hacen ir recogiendo monedas y gemas, conforme vamos recogiendo las Medallas de Exploradores. El viejo Miyagi nos ir\u00e1 dando herramientas que nos servir\u00e1n a lo largo del juego (palas para buscar f\u00f3siles, binoculares, una c\u00e1mara para tomar fotos, etc). El viejo es un taca\u00f1o que nos cobrar\u00e1 monedas a cambio de las herramientas; las monedas las vamos recogiendo en cada nivel, y se pueden encontrar gemas de distintos colores tambi\u00e9n. Los jefes finales en cada nivel, tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1n a la orden del d\u00eda.\n\nLas tareas que realizamos ser\u00e1n cronometradas, y son guardados en tablas de clasificaci\u00f3n que nos ponen a competir contra otros jugadores. Cada vez que ganamos una medalla y entramos a por una nueva, el clima o la hora del d\u00eda cambian, un detalle muy bonito dentro de un juego que se caracteriza por su enfoque old school. Muchos de los NPCs que nos topamos en el juego tienen algo que decir, llenando de vida el juego, agregando detalles la muy larga lista ya existente.\n\nTodo en Poi me recuerda mucho a Super Mario 64, estilo de manejo de c\u00e1maras, peque\u00f1as banderas que sirven de punto de control, saltos que terminan en un chapuz\u00f3n de barriga en el suelo, en fin, es una experiencia nost\u00e1lgica plataformera. Los niveles tienen distintos desaf\u00edos que se ir\u00e1n desbloqueando conforme vamos recogiendo medallones, como si fuesen estrellas en Mario. \n\nLa banda sonora logra estar a la altura del juego sin lugar a dudas. agrega una buena dosis de emoci\u00f3n  y aires de aventura en cada nivel. Cada acompa\u00f1amiento musical le viene muy bien al ambiente de cada nivel.\n\nNo me gusta que cuando usamos la c\u00e1mara para enfocar a lo lejos se ve todo muy borroso en la lejan\u00eda. La c\u00e1mara suele volverse un fastidio estando contra una pared. Me gustar\u00eda que hubiera un ataque de golpear (tipo pu\u00f1etazos), de momento la \u00fanica manera de eliminar los monstruos es con ataque de rodar en el suelo o brincando sobre ellos. Existen un desajuste en la detecci\u00f3n de los golpes, pues golpear a los enemigos brincando sobre ellos no siempre funciona, y eso es molesto.\n\nEl \u00fanico bug que encontr\u00e9 de momento es cuando el personaje usa un balde en su cabeza a modo de casco, si pasamos detr\u00e1s de las banderas de punto de control, se ve la sombra del personaje como si no tuviera el balde puesto. Existe una que otra ca\u00edda de FPS aqu\u00ed y all\u00e1; pero por dem\u00e1s, el juego anda perfecto. \n\nLos personajes quedan debiendo un poco, siento que tiene mas protagonismo el mismo Sr. Miyagi que los meros protagonistas del juego, pero aun asi, es una experiencia buena, que podemos disfrutar solos o junto con nuestros hijos, hermanos, sobrinos, Poi es un juego muy familiar. \nConclusi\u00f3n \n\nPoi es un juego sobrecogedor, te har\u00e1 recordar los viejos tiempos escalando rejas, saltando mientras evitas que la lava te queme mientras recoges monedas y coleccionables.

Yes I'm judging this game with minimal time invested in it, but that should be more a red flag against the game, rather than in its defense.\n\nI do like that this game is a call back to the era of 90s platformers, which still holds a dear place in my heart and several places on my top 10 favorite games of all time.\n\nHowever\n\nThis game does nothing to improve upon those old school games. The story is bland, with the entire premise being that you need to collect medals from different worlds to become a better explorer, or something. There really isn't any driving force behind the plot; and if there was one, it clearly wasn't memorable enough.\n\nIt has some interesting mechanics, so I'll give it that; for example, rather than an overworld, you help pilot a small airship to different worlds, and at times other airships will appear in the hub world that you can glide to with your parachute thingy. Other than that though, the mechanics are basically Super Mario Sunshine, minus the FLUDD capabilities.\n\nThe soundtrack is pleasant, but again with limited playtime, I haven't heard all of the tracks, or at least I hope I haven't. The sound effects are on par.\n\nWhen it comes to level design and challenge, this is where I feel there is a HUGE disconnect. From what I have played so far, this game is not challenging at all. Not even in the slightest. And the worlds are not very interesting. They all feel like a mishmash of objects rather than a carefully designed world. One of the biggest things that 90s platformers like Super Mario 64 or Banjo Kazooie had going for them was that they were designed for all ages.\n\nLet me explain: Take SM64 for example. To get to the Bowser fights (which weren't hard), you needed 8, 30, and 70 stars, respectively. Before going to any of those fights, you have a ton of options for which stars to go for. Before the first fight, you can get around 40 stars; the second, around 65, and the third, 119. You didn't need to get everything, so there were stars that were really easy to get (get to the top of the tower, for example), and then stars that were much more difficult to get (get 100 coins in each level, for example), which made the game winnable for kids, but provided enough challenge for adults to stay interested.\n\nAnd that's my main problem with this game. It feels like it caters far too much to children. There is not enough challenge to keep my interest.\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\n\nThe game is not memorable. It has good core concepts, but fails in execution. It feels far more like a clone of old school platformers than a new idea, and has absolutely no degree of difficulty. What it lacks in story and plot development it does not make up for in gameplay and level design.\n\nI'd give it a solid 6/10, so again a maybe.", "timestamp_created": 1487241606, "timestamp_updated": 1487241606, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.400555", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29939420": {"recommendationid": "29939420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094886497", "num_games_owned": 862, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487513902}, "language": "english", "review": "If you love Super Mario 64, you'll love this game.", "timestamp_created": 1487156960, "timestamp_updated": 1487156960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542489", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29924424": {"recommendationid": "29924424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255402169", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487430440}, "language": "english", "review": "Feels like a combination between Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time and Super Mario 64!", "timestamp_created": 1487091176, "timestamp_updated": 1487091176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29916815": {"recommendationid": "29916815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044891112", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487060328}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't played much, but it really fells like a bad Super Mario Galaxy : environnements are blocky and not really good looking, and the gameplay is a bit boring.

A clean, clear and crisp game clearly inspired by Mario 64 and Banjo Kazoie. The controls are tight and response, and work well with keyboard and mouse (I didn't try out my gamepad with this title, I didn't feel it necessary as keyboard and mouse felt good). The control of your character feels right, bouncing off walls and jumping onto platforms feels fun and flows well. That said, perhaps things were just the tiniest bit too floaty. Everything looks lovely and clear and the game and runs like butter. \n\nI have completely cleared three of the four worlds, and finished a large chunk of the side challenges and feel that perhaps the game is just the slightest tad too easy. That said, it was never-ever frustrating, that is why I started this review with the words \"chilled out\". The side challenges in particular are dead easy, where they could have been a good place to add some extra challenge to the game. Leaderboards do add the possibility of a meta-challenge though, for those looking for it. There is some particularly insane low times on some of the challenges already which seem nigh impossible for me to beat at this point. \n\nI happily chewed through the majority of this game in a lazy weekend, and enjoyed every minute of it. It feels like the perfect platforming package for $15. The difficulty of the game is such that it feels like getting that 100% of collectibles is a possibility (which is very satisfying). If you fondly recall playing platformers on N64 and the PS1 and want to revisit that era in a slicker, shinier wrapper, I highly recommend you purchase Poi.

The rest of the game is good, but the last 2 really stand out.\n-Boss battles are bad.  All of them are bad.\n\nAlright, so, overall, I really enjoyed the game, and I hope the developer continues to work in this genre.  I think this a really fantastic first go at the platformer, and I think it hits all the right notes.  The levels are fun and colorful.  The platforming, while a little too floaty, is still good.  The characters, although shallow, are cute.  It really does harken back to the Mario and Banjo & Kazooie days.  If you like collect-a-thon platformers like those, then you'll like this game.\n\nNow, there are some sore spots.  The bosses are by far the weakest part of the game.  They are unnecessary and I wish they weren't there.  Tougher platforming gauntlets would have been MUCH better than boss encounters.  The controls, while serviceable, are a little floaty.  You have the ability to be precise, but I did find myself getting out of control pretty often. Not ever games needs to be a precision platformer, but I with the character just felt a bit weightier.  The last 2 levels really show what this game could do.  I really wish the rest of the game had been as impressive as the last bits.  I absolutely loved the final 2 levels, and although I did enjoy my time in every level, I just felt retroactively let down by the rest of the game because of how great it ended.  It's not a bad thing, becuase the game is good overall, but you get a glimpse of a game that is so much better!

[/h1]\n\nPoi is one of the first platformers arriving to steam this year in what seems like the year of the platformer for video games. Other games are slowly falling behind it such as Hat in Time, and Yooka Laylee. Being the first has given the game a few advantages such as quenching the thirst for platformers in today's market. However, it brings a few problems as well.\n\n\n\n [b] CONS: [/b]\n\nPoi at some moments feels lacking in graphical and gameplay polish at certain key sections of the game. Detracting from the player's overall experience of title. For example, if you are good enough you can completly bypass challenges that the game wants to put you through. You may need to push a button then grab a few keys in order to reach a medallion thats trapped within a cage. However, with a little double jumping and wall rebounding you can skip all of that and grab the item. \n\nThere are multiple instances where this happens.\n\nYou jump across platforms that have spikes on them, but can easily ignore the spikes since they do not take up the entire platform. Majority of the time there are elements in the game that are supposed to pose some kind of challenge yet can be easily ignored or bypassed.\n\nGraphically the game has a simple artsyle that I can appreciate; however, the depth of field effect made my eyes tear up. There is too much and at times I felt the need to turn it off in order to find key items or landmarks within the stage.\n\nAs a collect-athon type game, it's important for the items that you are collecting to have meaning. While Poi provides insentive to grab everything, the main collectible of the game, coins, quickly lose their value. Coins are used to buy items and upgrades for your character as well as letting you participate in mini games. Once all upgrades have been bought, which can be done within an hour, money has no further value. It's just there.\n\nBosses are exteremly easy, this may be good or bad depedning on your preference.\n\nFinally, Poi as a modern platfromer does nothing new for the genre. There are no innovative mechanics or gamplay that seperates it from older titles.\n\n\n\n[b] PROS [/b]\n\nWhile Poi does not bring anything new to the table for the genre it does what we are used to well. Tight controls, colorful levels (albeit small), multiple things to collect, funny characters, and great music.\n\nDeaths were a somewhat common occurence do to the occasional pit, but it never felt that I was being cheated due to bad camera or controls. In addition Poi has no arbitrary slow transitions after death, meaning you can hop back into the action right away. Especially if you fall off the map.\n\nPoi's protagonists bring back all the familiar acrobatics that we are used to if you played a 3d mario title. Wall jumping, diving and belly sliding, kartwheel jumps, double jumps, etc. All feel fluid and useful. The controls in Poi are tight and felxible, allow you to combine many different moves together while keeping great control. This is one of the reasons why I was able to access certain areas that I normally should not have. Rather than change the controls, levels should be created around this mobility.\n\nPoi's hub world is also fantastic, as it gradually expands as you get further into the game.\n\nPoi's mini games are a nice distraction but the challenge levels are the main event. Completing the levels in a set time and comparing it with others on the leaderboard is a great feeling and provides replayability for the game. There is a definite push to speedrunning the game, which interests and enthusiast such as myself greatly.\n\nPoi also offers a Newgame + mode, however I have not had the chance to try that yet.\n\n\n[b] Verdict [/b]\n\nOverall it tooke me roughly 4 hours to beat the game. To collect every collectable in the game it took me 4 more hours. Resulting in 8 hours of gameplay.\n\nPoi sticks to what it knows best, and improving on it. While the game is rough around the edges its characters, levels, sounds, music, and controls allow it to pull through. Done by a small team of talented and creative people it is a game that you should not miss if you are a fan of the genre. \n\nI'm excited to see what the team behind Poi has in store for us next, and will look for future titles attentatively.", "timestamp_created": 1486594280, "timestamp_updated": 1486612175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527699", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29785070": {"recommendationid": "29785070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139164000", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487166716}, "language": "danish", "review": "Pretty fun to play", "timestamp_created": 1486572550, "timestamp_updated": 1486572550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29783737": {"recommendationid": "29783737", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052941330", "num_games_owned": 430, "num_reviews": 111, "playtime_forever": 746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487708081}, "language": "english", "review": "Poi is a fun little platformer that does not disappoint.

This isn't really a con though as most platformers aren't known for being focused on storytelling, but if you absolutely need a detailed plot and fully fleshed out characters, then this isn't the game for you.\n\nGame is focused around a hub world where you warp to other worlds that have mission based tasks to collect explorer medallions as well as other collectables. Each world has pretty standard environments that you see in other platformers (Cozy Canyon really reminded me of Super Mario Sunshine even). The hub also hosts several minigames including \n[spoiler]gliding through rings, challenge courses, navigating through mazes, battle arenas, and minesweeper fossil excavation[/spoiler]. Art style is very cartoony which I think works well. Music is pleasant and upbeat fitting the adventurous theme of the game. I played this using a controller (Xbox One), and thought it played well with some minor nitpicks (see below). 100% completion took me just under 7 hours, and you will need to do some of the side stuff to just beat the game. Upon completion you'll also unlock a new game plus mode ([spoiler]this mode restricts you to only having one hit in a mirrored version of the game + nothing carries over from you're previous file[/spoiler]).\n\nMost of the game is fairly easy (including the boss fights) with some anti-frustration features built in. There is no lives system and death is only a minor inconvenience. Upon death you'll restart at the beginning of the level or your last checkpoint while keeping everything you already collected (except coins). However, later missions in the [spoiler]Crystal Caverns[/spoiler] area can be tricky due to platforming on slippery surfaces, and the final area is quite hard compared to the rest of the game. There is also an optional compass item (that can be turned off or on as you please) to aid in finding most of the collectables, and a magnet (can't be turned off) that helps draw coins and collectables to you.\n\nSome minor nitpicks would be that I don't recommend rolling into enemies to defeat them. It usually ended up with me taking damage, and then ending up in an even worse position for potentially getting stunlocked. When you dig up fossils they pop up out of the ground and can end up over ledges. None of them ended up in places I couldn't reach them (like in pits or lava), but it did cause some unnecessary backtracking. It would be nice if these were automatically collected after you dug them up. Minor boss spoilers: [spoiler]There are two bosses that you need to kick an object at them to damage them. I had some slight difficulty lining up my shots correctly.[/spoiler] There were also a few times that I was having to fight the camera. I think this was meant to help the player in certain situations ([spoiler]such as going up and around the lighthouse in Cozy Canyon[/spoiler]), but I would have preferred having control of the camera at all times.\n\nOverall, I think Poi could use a tad more polish, but it's still a nice short but sweet experience that's fun to play for all ages.", "timestamp_created": 1486452877, "timestamp_updated": 1486452877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29756325": {"recommendationid": "29756325", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991045948", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486450460}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, easily holds it's own with the greats of the genre.

An exceptional platformer, most clearly remisicent of Super Mario 64, though it does just enough to stand on its own.\nControl-wise, your character controls simply and, for the most part, perfectly. There's also some neat tricks you can pull off, whether intentional or not, by clever use of double jumping off walls, which seems pretty perfect for speedrunning types.\nSpeaking of which, the leaderboards present in all stages (and prominent in the challenge stages) are a nice touch which shows good confidence in the game. The only small gripe is the odd camera issue, but they're few and far between, and have never gotten me killed.\nThe story is pretty standard, though it managed to be more charming than aggravating. My only gripe is a plot point in the form of a person that never shows up, or is properly explained; some conclusion to that, or a better explanation, might help settle that. Still, as far as excuse plots go, the motivation is at least understandable. Not that story is what you should be playing this game for, as should be evident from the game's inspirations.\nThe graphics are clean, simple and clear. Nothing incredibly textured, though there's a reasonable attention to detail which makes up for it. \nI found the game as a whole on the easier side (On NG, anyway), though I'm fairly experienced in platformers. Death isn't much of a setback in most instances anyway; there are sensibly placed checkpoints, and most levels are compact.\nIf you're a speedrunner, though, there's plenty here, especially in the challenge stages; not necessarily tough to complete, but requires a great deal of skill to get through optimally- especially for the key variants.\nLength-wise, the game is pretty short; getting through the story will probably take a handful of hours, and acquiring all 100 medallions a few more. A couple of the golden gears are irritating to find, as they don't show up on the compass. so a guide may be useful there, \nI haven't started NG+ yet, but from the looks of it, it offers a much stiffer challenge- having 1 heart alone would be problematic, and I'm fairly sure there are a number of other changes to trouble you further, if that's what you're after. You'll need to beat the final boss to acces NG+, mind.\nSpeaking of bosses...they're my only major gripe with this game. They can be elongated, confusing, pathetically easy etcetera depending on the boss and your experience with these types. Most bosses at least follow a three-hits-and-done rule to mean they don't outstay their welcome, outside of one boss which lasts five phases, and I felt could have been handled better.\nIn the grand scheme of things, though, it's a minor thing, and doesn't detract much from this game. The developer appears to have a great attitude, and it's clear a lot of genuine effort, talent and passion has gone in here.\nIn summary:\nPros:\n-Solid controls\n-Clean, clear visuals\n-Great level design\n-Works well for speedrunners\nNeutral:\n-A little on the easier edge outside of the challenge stages and NG+\n-Visual style may not be to everyone's taste\nCons:\n-Iffy boss battles\n-Generic story\nObjecively, I'd give it a 7/10, though my love of this sort of game earns it an 8/10 in my book. A couple of tweaks could easily turn it into a classic.\nKeep up the good work, devs.", "timestamp_created": 1486437094, "timestamp_updated": 1486437269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29752599": {"recommendationid": "29752599", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980295683", "num_games_owned": 799, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486508738}, "language": "english", "review": "Currently, probably as close as you can get to a Mario 64 experience on steam.

We had Axiom Verge, a love letter to the Metroid franchise, Stardew Valley, which could be considered a modern-day Harvest Moon, and now we have Poi, which wears the influence of Super Mario 64 on its hat, in so much as it has one.\n\nThe story is minimalistic. Two orphans are taken in by a veteran explorer and sent on a quest to collect a \u201cExplorer Medallions\u201d, which are supposed to be the key to finding the Milky Way Globe. To find these Medallions, you are sent to traverse a series of worlds and accomplish various tasks. In the first level, for example, you are charged with starting up a windmill, and dutifully you make your way across the various hills populated with hostile wildlife to turn a lever that stars platforms you can jump on to collect your first medallion. You are then given a list of other tasks to accomplish, which invariably end with collecting a hundred coins and turning them into a raccoon salesperson.\n\nThere are other ways to earn medallions however, many of which involving retrieving various collectables scattered throughout the level. Particularly notable is the fossil-digging minigame, involving finding a series of buried fossils in each level, digging them up with a shovel you buy from the explorer that took your character in, and returning them to a side character who appears in the hub world about midway through the story. Additional sidequests include finding various locations within each world, collecting a series of gears that are hidden, and participating in a series of obstacle courses designed to test your platforming ability.\n\nThe latter in particular is pretty fun and helps to extend the length of the game in a callback to more recent Mario platformers, though the sidequests are significantly easier than many gamers may have come to expect from the genre. The fact that dying has very little consequence softens the feel of the game even further, and I expect that gamers looking for a challenge might come away from Poi rather disappointed at the ease it is played. Speedrunners on the other hand might be pleased by the inclusion of leaderboards and the inclusion of an in-gamed timing feature that records the duration of each mission your character goes on.\n\nThat being said, the game is extremely fun to play. In particular, your characters handing ability has been refined to perfection, allowing for some fancy moves when jumping in each section. More than a few times, I would fall off a platform, but recover by jumping against a wall and back onto the section I stumped from, which gave a significant feeling of satisfaction.\n\nThe soundtrack also bears mentioning. Filled with dramatic tones and grandiose themes, it manages to evoke a distinct sense of wonder while not distracted from the gameplay. Due to only being five dollars, I found it worth the purchase price as well.\n\nIt is also worth considering that the developers have gone for a methodology of quality over quantity when it comes to level design. While the amount of levels is fairly small, each of them is so crammed full of secrets, collectables, and hidden goodies, that I expect those aiming for 100% completion will be busy for quite some time.\n\nOverall, Poi is a love letter to collectathon platformers, and an effective one at that. While it doesn\u2019t add anything new to the genre, those who have an appreciation for such titles will likely get their money\u2019s worth out it.\n9/10 \n", "timestamp_created": 1486259937, "timestamp_updated": 1486259937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29706857": {"recommendationid": "29706857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015112670", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486302694}, "language": "english", "review": "What a great surprise, I'm not a big fan of platformers but Poi changed my mind, it feels like a modern Mario 64 with lot of collectibles and a funny universe.\n\nThis game runs really smoothly even on low-end hardware, the developpers did a really great job.", "timestamp_created": 1486255589, "timestamp_updated": 1486255589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29706598": {"recommendationid": "29706598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037499511", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487511784}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] 3D Platformer Similar to Marion 64\t[/h1]\n\nPoi is a 3D platformer very reminiscent of the mid 90's early 2000's games like Mario 64, Banjo Kazooie and Spyro. The game functions very well, with the controls being smooth and the jumping is very easy to control. The game is a little easy for my taste, however I have not made it to the final areas of the game. You collect explorer medals (the games main collectable like stars in Mario 64) which unlock new areas. Coins can be also collected to buy a few items to make exploring more easier.\n\nIt's a very safe platformer that doesn't take many risks in design choices, but it still is fun and simple.

It's a charming and enjoyable 3D platformer filled with a sence of lightheartedness and whimsy that games largely lost sight of in the past generation. If you ever find youself yearning for the days of Crash Bandicoot, Banjo-Kazooie, and especially Super Mario 64, you owe it to yourself to check this out. That said, I have a fair few criticisms that I feel are worth talking about.\n\nThe worst offender is combat, which is dreary to the point that I almost wish it wasn't there. Enemies are dealt with with either a jump or a roll. But because the drop shadow takes a moment to cast, performing a controlled jump is weirdly difficult for me. The roll meanwhile has a certain window of effectiveness that, if mistimed, can not only get you hurt, but knock you into an even more compromising position than if you just attempted a jump. What's more, the roll just doesn't feel good as a mode of attack. All of these niggles conspired to make a strategy where I stood stock-still and jumped as enemies ran straight under my crushing feet of justice. This worked for 90 percent of enemies, even if they were in a mob. I'm not expecting a God of War combat system, but suffice to say I was missing Super Mario Galaxy's Spin attack.\n\nThe characters that you fun into feel pretty throwaway. They all have their purpose, and dispense medallions like they're supposed to, but that's all they feel like: Medallion dispensers. They don't move, really and repeat the same dialogue over and over again. It's a bit of a shame, because some of the characters look pretty cool, and you run into them a lot during your adventures.\n\nThere are other bugbears; Audio feels weirdly muted at places. The stand-out example is when I opened a treasure chest that was hidden in a cave, and coins gushed out of it in eerie silence. It brought the whole moment down with a sense of anti-climax. Another little thing is the fact that the mole enemies leave a permanent mound when you defeat them, which for some reason is steep enough that your character goes into a sliding animation when you run off of it. And since you can only defeat the moles by jumping on them, you may slip into the animation a lot, which serves to make combat even more annoying. Oh, and a bit of advice: on your first run, turn off the compass. Not only does it make exploration more fun, but for some reason the thing will show quest items, such as keys even when you very diliberately did not pick the key mission. On that note, some missions you can complete and continue exploring the level, and some will automatically transport you back to the hub, and the best way to find out which is which is trial and error.\n\nBut really, my biggest problem is the lack of creativity on display. For a game about going on a grand adventure, the mission design feels so rote and by the numbers. The key mission I referenced earlier? There is one in every single level, and few of the other missions are any more inspired. In fact, I would say most of the best moments are the Merchant's challenge levels which have less to do with collecting contextless keys and more to do with platforming over lava-spewing boulders and luging on icy superslides. I say most, because a stand-out mission for me was at Mount-Magma where __BEGIN SPOILERS you have to place bombs around the map to uncover a golgen temple thing that you start sliding and platforming around END SPOILERS__ I wish there were more moments like that, moments that make the world feel more tactile and alive, rather than just a big lump peppered with keys and \"Points of Interest.\" Don't get me wrong- I liked the idea of looking for points of interest; you're an adventurer, after all. But like the treasure chest, it filled me with a resounding sense of anti-climax. Finding points of interest rewards you with Medallions, but I was far more interested to learn more about the history (or lore) of the points I'm looking at. There are strange books and momentos and bones of failed expeditions that amount to just boxes to check off. It's a strange thing, because the fossils and creatures you take pictures of produce the bios I want, the bios an explorer with a book would presumably make (Though I still wish they were a bit longer).\n\nAll of this may sound like I'm down on the game, but I'm really not. Poi is a delightful platformer that I would heartily recommend to any fans of this nigh forgotten genre. This game has flashes of utter brilliance, like the first time you jump off the ship to find you can fly across the Sky. I was genuinely giddy, filled the sense of wonder you just don't get from a military shooter.

I need them. I can't resist them. Doesn't matter if they're 2D or 3D. They're like sex to me. So when I heard about Poi, I naturally had to pick it up. And it's pretty good. \n\nIt takes a lot of its DNA from Mario, especially 64 and Sunshine. Same hub-like structure, same \"collect the stars\" structure (only they're medallions). If it's not broke, as they say. And for the most part, it works very well here, aided by pretty good (albeit slightly stiff) controls. The level design in particular is worth praising. Each of the hub areas is large, detailed (given the restrictions of the N64-ish graphical style) and filled with secrets. The game even points out special landmarks when you reach them, which was appreciated.\n\nThat said, I have a couple of complaints.\n\nFirst off, it's kinda short. I did everything I felt worth doing in just under six and a half hours. Sure, there's various items that you can collect if you want to be a completist but I'm not a big collectathon fan unless I know that it'll open extra content (especially new levels). Second, it's easy. Too easy. I breezed through this game. Granted, I have a lot of experience in this genre but I would have preferred the game to have some teeth. Ironically, it finally acquires some in the final level, where the vast majority of my deaths occurred. This level reminded me of some of the more fiendish challenges in Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 and I wish there were more like this. Worth noting is that the game has a solid checkpoint system and does away with lives altogether, something I wish the 3D Marios would also do. \n\nFinally, the music. It gets very, very repetitive. Most of the blame there lies with the short loops. The compositions themselves are solid (even if several of the pieces owe a great debt to Copland) but they repeat so often that they started to drive me crazy. It's often a very fine line in games like this, writing music that is interesting but also holds up under repetition. I don't feel it quite got there.\n\nBut even with these gripes, I had a good time and that's pretty much all that matters here. It's exactly what I needed to play at this point in my life and it's mostly certainly worth the price (and then some).", "timestamp_created": 1486214390, "timestamp_updated": 1486214390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550428", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29692376": {"recommendationid": "29692376", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977378918", "num_games_owned": 944, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489264935}, "language": "english", "review": "This game borrows a lot from Mario 64 in particular, but that is NOT a bad thing.

There are way too many things to talk about, which means this is going to be a rather lengthy review, and it might also be all over the place due to the amount of stuff that comes to mind, but let's dive right in.\n\nI've spent most of my teenage years and all of my early adulthood wishing for the \"perfect\" 3D platformer, one that combined most of the things I like in a single, awesome package. I dreamed of a game with a rich, vast world to explore. It had to have a lot of secrets and tricks to discover, but it also had to have well designed platforming and action to boot, and the atmosphere had to evoke feelings of childlike wonderment and adventurous endeavors in boththe soundtrack, the visuals and the story. The characters had to be adorable and stylish, and the gameplay had to be smooth and thrilling.\n\nIt goes without saying that the game I dream of still doesn't exist, and it may never exist. I'd never expect, however, that of all the developers that exist worldwide, the one that'd come the closest to fulfilling my dreams would be PolyKid, an indie studio that clearly puts a lot of love into its creations. By creating Poi, they came closer to making the game of my dreams than all high profile studios put together. From the beginning to the end of my experience, it constantly marveled me, making me feel immersed in a world of wonders in the shoes of an eager, brave and fun loving child ready to see the world from up close and explore every inch of it.\n\nLet me start by saying that this game sounds amazing. Every tidbit, from the awesome soundtrack (speaking of which, the airship songs are some of my favorite video game songs ever), to the characters' exclamations when they jump, to the grunting noises made by the enemies. All of that put together helps create a perfectly cartoony, adorable, but also epic and adventurous atmosphere throughout the entire game.\n\nThe graphics are not highly detailed nor realistic, but the endearing cartoonish style they go for is just perfect for the feeling of childlike wonderment I so wished to find in a 3D platformer. They look beautiful, and go perfectly well with the feel of the story and the gameplay. Every level element, every character and every object contribute to this cartoony atmosphere, making me feel like I'm playing an awesome saturday morning cartoon with a hell of a soundtrack to boot.\n\nSpeaking of characters, this game has plenty, and while neither of them are very deep or emotionally complex, they're all lovely and very well designed. Each character has their personality perfectly reflected in their outfits, their cartoony expressions and their dialogs. There's the hide and seek girl, the old explorer guy, the spaceship engineer, the penguins, and many others. I especially like the female protagonist, who's featured in many adorable loading screen drawings, doing things like listening to a sea shell or relaxing by a tree, and the challenge levels guy, with his stern expression and tribal facepaint. The characters are exactly what one would expect to see in an awesome saturday morning cartoon about adventure and exploration. Nothing too deep and psychological, but still endearing and stylish.\n\nNow, of course, even the most adorable game is not that great if the gameplay is not good, right? Right. Thankfully, Poi delivers in the gameplay department even moreso than in the others. Every level is rich in secrets and places to explore, the missions are legitimately fun to accomplish, and the 3D platforming is rich and exhilarating. The 3D platforming, in particular, is something I feel that Poi does a lot better than most non-indie games I've played, due to how \"free\" one feels when exploring a level, jumping around, and finding different paths to a same objective. Each objective and item you have to pick up has many alternative routes that lead to them, some involving running and jumping, others involving enemy bashing, etcetera.\n\nThe level themes are nothing new or original, but that doesn't really matter. They're varied enough: deserts, canyons, snowy fields, dark caves, etcetera. All of those themes are very well represented in both the graphics and the music. What really matters to me is that every level is well designed in spite of the simple and even cliche themes.\n\nThe sheer variety in missions, levels and objectives is also pretty cool. You may dig for fossils, locate landmarks, take pictures of different animals, run against the clock, fly through rings, collect tokens, face batches of bad guys all at once, defeat evil bosses, find your way through mazes and overall be a badass. None of the mission types are exactly unheard of, but the fact that all of them are perfectly represented in this game, in very well designed and fun levels, is almost a dream come true.\n\nOur heroes may acquire a set of tools to help them along their quest to become master explorers, like a camera to take the aforementioned pictures, a shovel to dig the aforementioned fossils, and a compass to locate the aforementioned tokens and landmarks. Those little tools add yet an extra layer of variety to the game, albeit a thin one, and they make the whole experience richer in the long run.\n\nThe story is not the richest and deepest story of all time, but it doesn't have to be. In fact, if it were, it'd probably break the free and whimsical feel of the game. The story is good enough for a saturday morning cartoon - I can't believe I'm mentioning saturday morning cartoons again - but far from a Tolkien-esque masterpiece. It's not bad, and it serves its purpose nicely. A more complex story would be out of place in this game.\n\nI know this review is a mess, and kind of all over the place, it's just that I find it hard to present my opinions on this game in an orderly and organized fashion. Even as I wrap this review up, I know I'm going to think of something else to talk about later, and I'll regret not having put it here. I hope I've been clear in one thing, though: that this game is very close to being the game I've always dreamed of, and if you like exploration, adventure and action, you should do yourself a favor and grab a copy of this right now.\n\nI wish I could give a larger thumbs up than the mere \"yes\" thumb that's given to us in this formulary.", "timestamp_created": 1486186227, "timestamp_updated": 1494136964, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.738332", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29683665": {"recommendationid": "29683665", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996694804", "num_games_owned": 677, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 1722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512316794}, "language": "english", "review": "This was a super fun Mario 64 like platformer and is family friendly.

I loved it from early access and the final release does not disappoint. It's not breaking new ground but everything works well and feels good - great, even. Music plays a big part in that; the game's score perfectly captures the mood of each environment. They're lovely tracks and feel right out of a Nintendo or Rare game without being derivative of those games. For $15 I would recommend it. If you're anticipating A Hat in Time and Yooka-Laylee, this is another one you definitely want to check out.\n\nMy one complaint with the game is stutter. Poi hitches at certain points; I'm not sure if the issue is bad frame pacing or loading but it's very noticeable when it happens (though not terribly frequent). This wasn't in the earlier betas at all so I'm hoping that it's something the developer will be able to fix.

So far, it's delivered fully in that aspect.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe gameplay is incredibly solid, with relatively tight controls. There are some minor quirks, like the roll jump having relatively precise timing to pull off, and enemies sometimes being a little annoying to jump on; but overall the controls are solid and you won't find yourself fighting to keep a handle on your character. The movement of your character is incredibly similar to the Super Mario games, with the ability to Triple Jump from a continous set of jumps, do sideflips, walljumping, and a dive jump that allows you to slide.The game also includes movement familiar to other games, like having a double jump in the air, and a jump that you can execute out of a roll for extra momentum. Chaining the roll jump into a dive jump can create some incredible speed if you like moving fast. The game also takes further inspiration from Mario by having you jump on enemies to kill them; you can also kick stunned enemies/items by walking into them.\n\n[h1]Collectathon Aspects[/h1]\nLike collectathons before it, this game has several forms of ways to collect items, all with the ultimate goal of collecting the explorer medals. These include but are not limited to: The Explorer Medals themselves, Golden Cogs, and a Picture Book. As you progress, new types of collections appear, and new things to explore and discover are revealed. This game doesn't appear to have a lack of things to collect and in turn feels like you'll have plenty to do besides just beating the game.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nThe music in this game exceeds my expectations. They suit the levels and the environments, and they're incredibly pleasant to listen to. They're pretty whimiscal. I would heavily suggest in buying the soundtrack if you're into that.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThis will mostly fit the rest of the stuff, like Graphics and Story. As far as the graphics are concerned, they're pretty good. The 3D graphics look a little more out of the PS2/GameCube era of gaming, but a bit more polished. However, I don't see that as something that detracts from the experience. Instead, it brings a level of charm that really hearkens back to an era of gaming now long lost. The only downside is that the environments feel a little... empty. Maybe a bit more on the basic side. \n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe Story is pretty basic, you're asked to go out and collect some Explorer Medals from an old adventurer so he can vicariously live one more adventure out through you. I haven't seen a hint of an ulterior story boss or anything. The story might be a bit on the lackluster side, but seeing as how this game is far more colorful and lighthearted, and likely built to help revive a genre slowly coming back; a deeper story really doesn't feel needed. \n\n[h1]Extras[/h1] \nThe game does have a few extra things, such as hidden hats to collect and a new game+ mode for you to play through after you've completed the game. These help establish replayability along with the collectathon aspects of the game.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\nI feel I should at least point out a few things that might detract from the experience for some.\n-Environments feel a bit bare. Thematic in nature, but they feel a little empty towards that theme for me in some way that I just can't explain.\n-Level Design is average. It's not incredibly good, but it's nowhere near bad. Nothing stands out as silly with placement, and nothing seems terribly pointless. The flow of the levels just feel a bit off to me; it might go hand in hand with the previous point of the environment feeling a tad bare for me.\n-Story is fairly simplistic. This isn't really a con for me considering the colorful, lighthearted nature of the game, it doesn't feel like it needs to go all out with a story. So far, I haven't yet had an inkling of a deeper story. This might detract from your experience a bit depending on how much you care. \n-Barely any invincibilty frames. The first time I got knocked by an enemy, it proceeded to ram me twice more before I could get a proper jump on it since I was a little stunned that it was hitting me so quickly.\n\n[h1]Closing Thoughts[/h1]\nOverall, this is an incredibly solid 3D platformer, and perfectly fits in with the collectathon genre. There's plenty to do and plenty of time to be spent in this game. It does have a few flaws, but none of them are glaring, and you likely won't notice or care about most of them while you're enjoying your time playing.

It's a cheat 15 dollar platformer so don't expect too much, it took me less then 7 hours to 100% the final version of the game, it's simple fun and if you can manage to not compare it to the big time games like mario 64 through galaxy (and every other famouse 3d platformer) I'd say give it a try.", "timestamp_created": 1486114243, "timestamp_updated": 1486114243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29664002": {"recommendationid": "29664002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095414526", "num_games_owned": 523, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486199507}, "language": "english", "review": "Seriously the most fantastic game I've played in years!

The controls are great, and the flow of movement in the game is even better. Back to my reference of Sunshine, I can see a lot of inspirations from SMS in this game. The movement is very similar to SMS, which is great because it was pretty good. You have a double jump and a little dive thing you can do mid-air, and these combine to make it pretty fun to move vertically! I can definetely see this being a game that is played by speedrunners in the future. Another thing that reminded me of SMS was the design of the first level, it felt oddly nostalgic and comfortable.

In the old review I said that it was really fun, and great for anyone who likes Mario 64. I praised it a bit too much and said I couldn't find any flaws with it. I still think it's really fun and great for Mario 64 fans, but there are some flaws that I didn't really notice from being so excited that there was a new collectathon game. My biggest issue with it is that the characters aren't very interesting. There's nothing necessarily bad about them, but they aren't designed or written to make you remember them. If they didn't have mechanical uses, you probably [b]would[/b] forget their existence. The other problem is that the game is still a little buggy, but there'll probably continue to be patches. The bugs aren't anything to keep you from enjoying the game, just little stuff that'll make you go \"huh, that's a kinda off\". But overall, with that in mind, I still think the positives outweigh the negatives. It's fun, the controls are good, the music is great, and even at the lowest settings the game looks good. I'd still recommend it to anyone who likes this genre of games, and it's pretty much worth $15.

Bugs, glitches, and gameplay oversights spoil the fun. Enemy interactions are difficult to comprehend let alone survive. Jumping is made difficult by a few unnecessary mechanics taken from SM64 that as far as I found had no use in this game other than to impede my rhythm. There is an irksome cutscene that plays each time you collect one of 100 medallions, which was typical in SM64 but was fixed by Banjo Kazooie/ Tooie. I had 1 soft crash occur in the 7 hours I played it (2 of those hours I was AFK while I had a rubberband on my controller to achieve a \u201cstep counter\u201d mission) and as far as content in the early access version goes, I believe I have done everything.\n\nPoi is a good game by a very small team.

Since it's well made, and with love, I'm giving it a thumbs up. But don't let that override my original \"review\":\n\nSo... this game is... fine. Just fine. Let me explain:\nIt's in early access. When I got it, I wondered why; it seemed pretty damn near complete. It was a great \"zen game\", to just space out with, enjoying the instantly gratifying physics and mechanics of this Mario64-esque platformer. Some content was clearly missing, but it was obviously \"complete\" enough for the devs to be fine with selling, none too cheap. The platforming was just challenging enough to not be boring, while it was an overall carefree and stress-free easygoing gameplay experience, with a matching artistic aesthetic. Very kid-friendly.\n\nThen I took a break from it for a few months. Updates were made.\n\nWhen I came back to the game, it was changed. Not unrecognizably, but in the essence of what it was. I don't know if it was always the devs' plan (which is likely), or if it was in response to/anticipation of mainstream criticism, but they had added enemies. \nThis changed everything. At the point I was then playing it at, the mechanics had not changed, so there was no new attack function, save jumping on the enemies' heads, which it seems the game was not built for. There is a reason Mario64 added a \"punch\". \nMoreover, the addition of enemies and timed challenges stripped this game of its originality and unique appeal. The 3D Mario games already exist, and if I wanted to play them, I would already do that. It has lost its \"zen game\" feel, and some of its accessibility to small children (which it clearly had prior to the new additions). \n\nWhich is not to say that these new additions ruin the game, or make it \"bad\". It's just sad that when I thought I had found something truly unique, original, and fun - a new itiration of an old formula -, it turns out this was considered \"incomplete\", and was changed to match consumer expectations of a 3D platformer, following a 20-year-old formula to a T. \n\nIf you like the 3D Marios, and want more of the same, the current game is great, and I recommend it. And I hope they can salvage some originality here, going forward.

I just wish it were faster here. 4;Underwater. I am sure people don't like water levels, but like the atmosphere, so you can add underwater gameplay for the atmosphere.

Thanks\n___________________________________________________________________________\n \nEntry #1\n_______\nPoi, to put it bluntly is a love letter to platformers that have been extinct since the 90\u2019s, where Mario 64 changed the game as we know it. We\u2019ve had Banjo Kazooipoipove, Donkey Kong 64 and others of the same type, Poi can stand right along beside them. There are two characters to choose from, a boy and a girl. They don\u2019t really stand out and to be honest they are kind of generic and lack the personality of Mario but they do the job. Maybe it\u2019s the nostalgia talking, or the great art style, but it nails the feel. You have your triple jump, your wall jump, the run and the quickly juke back into a somersault move maneuver. All is missing is the slide into a jump move.\n\nThe first world that I played inpoimedallion was colorful, with enemies abound, and you can guess how to kill them. Platforms were floating, wires acting as bridges to the next mountain, were set. Everything is as what you would expect of the genre.\n\nI haven\u2019t played much, and I played very little in fact, but I was so excited I just had to write something down.\n\nThere are items to collect, aka red coins, medals aka stars, and regular coins. You access the different worlds via a helm of an airship acting as the hub. I look forward to playing more, in fact I\u2019m off to play right after this post. I enjoyed it quite a bit, and I give this first impression a silver trophy.\n_______________________________________________________\n\nEntry #2\n__________\nI was very excited to play Poi last time, and now I\u2019ve put almost 3 hours into it and have a clearer view on it. Yes, I said it\u2019s a Mario 64 clone, and that hasn\u2019t changed. There are different worlds that have their own unique theme. For example, Cozy Canyon was all about greenery and water, it was a relaxing, fun, place to play in. Then there\u2019s Magma Canyon that has a desert tone to it, with reds, and grey towers.\n\nYou start off with access to only one world, Cozy Canyon. Then you have to earn enough Medallions to enter the next area, in my case 10 to enter Magma Canyon. Each area has multiple Medallions, for example, CC has one for collecting 7 Coins, another has you simply climbing a windmill. They get more creative with one having you play hide and seek or collecting seeds. Your airship aka the world hub, introduces new characters that have their own ships. To reach them you simply jump off your boat and\n\nAlong the way you collect coins that go into your stash. These coins can then be used to purchase items that help you. You can buy the very useful compass, that points you in the direction of the objective. A telescope that allows you to see far, or a shovel to dig fossils.", "timestamp_created": 1482644815, "timestamp_updated": 1482644815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28610629": {"recommendationid": "28610629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082835813", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474122354}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't even made it pass the first level.", "timestamp_created": 1482615161, "timestamp_updated": 1482615161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482705", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28576918": {"recommendationid": "28576918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154001367", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482063586}, "language": "english", "review": "Poi is a charming platformer that reminds me alot of Mario 64.

This game is good times, simple as that. My biggest complaint is it's not yet finished and I want to play more.\n\n2. As of the middle of September 2016, gameplay feels really solid. There are some glitchy bits here and there but overall the mechanics feel pretty complete. It controls basically in the manner of more or less every 3D platformer ever and that is just fine.\n\n3. The story elements are not nearly so close to being finished. You play as a boy or a girl who has to go places and do things for some reason.\n\n4. The thing that continually impressed me was how you could miss a jump or fall off a ledge you were following and somehow wind up in a new area w/ new things to explore. I would routinely get sidetracked on the little missions you are given and would often find myself doing something completely different than what I sent out to do.  \n\n5. I really enjoyed the music but could not shake the feeling it was bit generic.\n\n6. My least favorite part of [i]Poi[/i] was the enemy design. I can't quite put my finger about what bugs me about them but they mostly struck me as a bit cheap.\n\n7. There is only one boss battle in this so far and it is honestly not great.\n\n8. All of the various worlds both looked different and had different elements that made them play different. I think this could be pushed farther but it's a good start.\n\n9. I am not sure if it's in the plans but the characters are all minimally voiced. They just make a grunt or say hi or something when you talk to them and then you have to read the text on a screen.\n\n10. Number 9 is actually a good thing in my point. Having everything voice acted is overrated. \n\n11. The one thing that is a bit wonky about gameplay is sometimes when you manually adjust the camera, the game will re-take control over it too quickly, which is annoying as all get-out but not game-breaking or anything.\n\n12. This has a solid amount of content already for early access. I imagine if you are one of those 100%-ing goofballs, it could take over ten hours to do everything. I played about six and am waiting for new content before diving back in.\n\n13. It bears repeating that I will dive back in and play this once there is more to play.

I wouldn't mind it, life wasn't that bad then, my dad wasn't really depressed and my mom wasn\u2019t a scary religious zealot. Smart phones weren\u2019t released, so people had to have real books, and real friends. Life didn\u2019t feel like a meaningless nightmare of suffering quite yet. Ahhh, nostalgia. That\u2019s exactly how Poi wants to make you feel. \n\t\u201cRemember those games you liked that were released in the 90s, with the platforming and fun?\u201d It seems to say. \n\tI do remember those games quite well, actually. I never played Banjo and Kazooie, but I did play Super Mario 64, a lot. As a kid I beat the game at least over 10 times, and screwed around in it a lot more. I probably played the game over 200 hours. Of course, I was a kid, about anything is fun to a kid. I bet Poi would even be fun to a kid, but it certainly was rather mediocre to me. \n        Poi is a platforming game that, as I said before, tries to net the nostalgia of 90s platformers. In gameplay, it does it fine, though the controls are exactly the same as Super Mario 64, the jumping, the literal everything. Could that be a gripe? Maybe, but there certainly is a market for games that are \u201cSuper Mario 64, but better.\u201d There is, however, not much of a market for games that are \u201cSuper Mario 64 with absolutely no personality.\u201d That\u2019s the biggest problem with Poi, it\u2019s really generic. The levels are really quite boring, and while they are very different from each other, they have the same feel of being completely nonexclusive. Mario 64, however, had distinct music that gave every level a different mood, with way more different aesthetics and themes. Poi misses the mark there, big time. Also, Poi (at this point) doesn\u2019t have very many levels at all, 5 big levels and a collection of challenges. Super Mario 64 had 15 big levels, and another 15 unique challenges with unique themes as well. \n       Okay, so the world is lacking in Poi, but what about the character themselves? \u201cThe Explorer\u201d (who apparently isn\u2019t named Poi) is really generic as well. Sure, they make noises when they get hurt, but they don\u2019t really say anything about who they are, and they aren\u2019t funny. Super Mario 64 was a funny game. Mario made funny noises and had little reactions to things, like when he would throw Bowser, he would say \u201cgoodbye me Bowsy\u201d in a really funny Italian accent. The character in Poi is rather annoying. \n       Another issue I have with Poi, is that the collectables are chore to get. Super Mario 64 had red coins and regular coins, that were easy to see and somewhat fun to collect because you got to see the interesting levels. Poi not only has silver keys and coins, but locations and artifacts as well. I completed all of them in one of the stages, and I wanted to rip my eyeballs out with a spoon. Even then, the compass in the game really ruins a good part of it, because most of the time it feels like you\u2019re just walking in a certain direction trying find a patch of dirt to dig up a dead thing.\n       The plot in Poi is also lacking, mainly because it's not a very good Plot. There is no antagonist, really. I suppose you could say the environment is an antagonist, but it's not a very good one. In Super Mario 64 though, Bowser brought all of the villans in all of the levels to screw things over, who also kidnaps the princess, giving Mario a reason to do anything. There is no call to action in Poi, you're just helping out an old man, and he doesn't really seem very appreciative.\n       The game also has bugs, one of them making it so a boss can't be killed. I didn't finish the game, because I couldn't. Also, the camera likes to go through the ground a lot, which is really annoying. By the time you buy it, it may have less bugs, but as of now it's a bit of a mess.\n       In conclusion, the game has alright enough gameplay, but has no personality, annoying characters, bugs, and too many fucking collectables.

It's annoying to see and shows no real reason except for a boring side quest.\n- Some sort of change to the level selection, since it's really sluggish to pick the level you want.\n\nA lot of the time it looks like the game doesn't know what to do for level design so it puts in another tower. Maybe not much of a problem, but it really adds to the repetitiveness in the level structure.\nThe game ranges from decent, boring, and broken.

That includes doing all the challenge levels and spending some time just digging up fossils.)\n\nPoi is Super Mario 64 stripped down to its skin and bones right now. It's got tight controls that gives a good platforming experience, but one of the bossess is bugged so it can't be beaten and the world is lackluster both in level design and overall world design, which doesn't work too well together with a limited and basic set of mechanics.\n\nMechanically you have the basics, you can jump and double jump, far jump (roll + jump), sprint, pushing objects and wall jump. This makes for a very familiar but lacking platformer experience, as no attack moves, stomps or anything of the sort limits your interaction with the world, its currently limited to buttons you jump on and that one incident where you have to push an object onto a square (the push is otherwise only used to turn things).\n\nThey've added a shovel to the game to dig up artifacts which is just random fossils plopped down on the map which you gather to gain a medallion when you've found all of them in a level, wholly pointless and just more stuff for the sake of it. Same with the \"locations\" feature where there are set places in the world which triggers a location reveal, which if you find all of them in a level you get a medallion for. This is further pointless because you can buy a compass that shows you the location of both the fossils and locations when you're nearby them.\n\nThe world design is a nonexistent sloppy mess of random things put together to become platforms and a level. There is no coherency to the obstacles, the world or the enemy designs, its just random stuff cobbled together.\n\nThe level design is as basic as it gets and works more as a proof of concept than finished levels, it has all the elements of a platformer, moving platforms, ropes, thin walkways, ice, slide ramps danger zones, basic clearly-based-on-S64 enemies and all that, but its put together like a playtest. There is no consideration for why the things are there in the world, it doesn't show off an identity to the world, it just is there, because it's a game and platformer.\n\nThe art is relatively good, but also, pretty generic, the game in its current state is mostly carried by texture alone, lightning in the game seems almost nonexistent, with it just seemingly being fullbright lightning, no fancy shaders going on here, except for metal objects and water. Which is a shame since they are very much going for the \"Nintendo look\", it just lacks the fancy lights for it. Though that shouldn't be a priority at this stage of development either way, I'm just hoping its not looking like intended.\n\nI'm really looking forward to seeing this game in its finished state, it shows a lot of promise and I had fun playing it for sure, despite all of its downsides, I just hope they can pull it through, the long time between updates is not reassuring, especially not when there is a critical bug with a final boss that's been in there for months.\n\nI wouldn't really recommend buying it in its current state unless you're really desperate for a classic platformer in your library, and you can't wait for Yooka-Laylee.

Probably the most important point. \n* Levels are varied and fun to explore. \n* OST is simple, but relaxing. \n* Character designs and the overall visual design is cute and cosy. \n* Two characters, though they are essentially identical other than gender. \n* Full controller support.\n\nCons: \n* Camera clearly needs work. In some segments it spins automatically, due to climbing towers or doing puzzles, but it's hard to keep it from doing so when not needed. \n* Some mechanics are present but are not really fleshed out or used to its potential. I trust this will be expanded upon.\n* One level could not be completed due to a bug, I trust this will be fixed. \n* A few level designs feel as if they borrowed too much from platformer classics, especially SM64. \n* The challenge runs are often either too messy or too uninteresting. Also, see above point. \n* Enemies are more of a nuisance than a threat, in addition to not being particularly varied. \n\nAll in all I recommend this game if you played the old 3D platformer games, and want what's essentially a modern old school platformer.

That about wraps up your list of available moves.  Now throw in compact stages with a central world hub and call it a video game.  It seems like four developers from Mario 64 were kidnapped, frozen for 20 years or so (wow, has it been that long already?), recently thawed out and forced to invent a new IP.  And then some composer was hired off the street or something.\n\nAs stated before (like at the very beginning so you probably don't remember), Poi is a really simple game.  All of the objectives are very clear and close in proximity.  To make up for this lack of scale the creators saw fit to add stop watches per objective.  Nothing like getting a gold medal on a challenge stage, then realizing that you are, in fact, little shit number 497.  Congratulations.  \n\nIn Poi, you are... Poi.  A boy (or girl, depending on your gender identity of the minute) who has been tasked with retrieving an old man's lost explorer medals.  And Poi, in ze's (or... zer's?) ADD-ridden state who can't sit still in a classroom to save zis life, kindly obliges.  \n\nThe graphics in Poi are bright.  Lots of color everywhere and appropriately placed sections of minimal pallette variety.  What's missing here is detail and more polygons, not to mention that the textures are rather underwhelming.  I'd also hate to appear nitpicky, but the API doesn't like to stay at 144 frames per second on my GTX 1070.  At least there are some modern lighting effects in use.  Yay.\n\nThe gameplay itself is mixed.  It is seamless and smooth for the most part.  The level design allows the player to speedily bounce from platform to platform and the double jump and edge grabbing mechanics are very forgiving in most cases.  That being said, Poi is slow in opening up new areas.  It's a common symptom of games with little content to keep the player repeating the same stages over and again in order to advance.  Small challenge stages fill the gaps between the levels, but their variety and simplicity makes it quite transparent that these are meer time killers.  Some refinement is in order at this point as well, like the hitboxes for enemies.  Even the simplest little buggers can be very annoying and will kill you all the way dead unless you're extra careful.  \n\nFor the bottom line, Poi is a nice early access game to keep your kids occupied for a time.  The pace is faster than Mario 64 and the game itself is a lot more pretty, but there are still some glitches that need to be worked out.  For now, where Poi sits fills a giant gap in the PC gaming segment, but it only leaves me desperate for something better.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZa0l2Yb5hM", "timestamp_created": 1471229535, "timestamp_updated": 1471229535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24922601": {"recommendationid": "24922601", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997884938", "num_games_owned": 367, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498602951}, "language": "english", "review": "Reminds me of Super Mario 64 and Banjoo Kazooie in it's own unique way. :)\nOnly a few hours of game play though.

If you enjoyed 3D platformers from the N64/Playstation->Gamecube/PS2 era you will feel like a kid again when you play Poi. \u2665\n+ Heavily influenced by Mario 64 / Sunshine. To some, this may sound like a bad thing, but everything just feels so right almost like you are playing a new Mario game. There are tons of references I could list, but triple jumping, and jumping on enemy heads to defeat them are things you will notice right away.\n+ Visually the game is just full of appeal. Somewhat \"polygonal\" in nature, but I feel like this was to mimic games of old, and personally I just think the game looks fantastic. \n+ The gameplay or I suppose I should say \"the controls\" feel almost perfect! Plenty of ways to jump, hop, climb, run, roll, and lunge around. Really shows off the right way to make a 3D platformer, and is a ton of fun to play.\n+ The level design is spot on. You really couldn't ask for better obstacle courses, and areas to jump, flip, and collect all sorts of things. Also, very similar to Mario, you can replay areas with new objectives to get additional medallions (stars). Along with this, each time you play a level the weather / day / night cycle changes so you get a new perspective of the stage each time.\n+ The soundtrack.... feels so nostalgic... it is sooooooo goood! Good enough to be background music in movies! The composer Lyndon Holland deserves a reward! The music fits the game so well, I loved every moment!\n+ The game is a bit casual, but I honestly thought this was a good thing. You rarely every have to replay stages or reset your progress. There's plenty of checkpoints, and enemies are not very hard to avoid or defeat. (This is also a great game for kids!)\n+ Lots of side-levels or challenge stages that are short and sweet that help keep the game feeling fresh. (I especially liked the slide level)\n\n- The one thing that is sort of missing from Poi is that there doesn't seem to be any challenging enemies or bosses to defeat. Most of the enemies are just distrations that you try to avoid, or you jump on them to kill them easily.\n- I was frustrated a bit with the hitbox when jumping on enemies. Sometimes you will go to jump on something only to get damaged when you land.

The tactic of the day is jump as soon as they get close and watch them kill themselves on your feet. I would like there to be some thought when platforming and killing these cute little guys.\n\nMost of the platforming is easily ruined by the one mechanic you are taught in the first second of the game, double jumping. I feel like some sections that should take a little more thought and time are easily blasted by this dare I say \"OP\" move.\n\nOk, enough with the rant of this early acc. game, here are some notable reasons this game has me hooked a hour in:\n\nI LOVE THE HUB WORLD. The sky is such a nice place and the traveling between the islands puts a big old stupid grin on my face.\n\nI don't ever feel discourged to visit the same map over and over. I havn't gone \"Dam, i have to travel past this garbage section again\" which i found myself saying alot during my play throughs of SM sunshine and SMN64. There are so many ways to get around the map its pretty funny. I love seeing how fast I can get places the second time around.\n\nOk, things that need improving for future patches:\n\nThe game warns you about fall damage, I can't tell if there is any. It makes getting places alot faster, but my guy prob needs a visit to the ER for the places i've jumped off.\n\nThe detection for climbing up a lege you are hanging off is weird. I found my self trying despretly trying to climb up ledges over and over in one section in the second world, that i sat there for about 20 min, falling over and over trying to jump up to small wooden beams.\n\nSo finally, the rating of this game 9/10 for an EA (early acc) title. I can't wait for the next patches and i know I will have this booted up every time i wait for a LOL game to start up. \n\nThank you if you read my reveiw and I hope you will give this game a shot!\n", "timestamp_created": 1470479830, "timestamp_updated": 1470479830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24738117": {"recommendationid": "24738117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013639535", "num_games_owned": 549, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506773999}, "language": "english", "review": "YES\nThis game is so relaxing.

I could pick some nits, but overall, it's absolutely stellar, especially for a title in early access. The devs are also active and attentive, which is a huge plus. Worth way more than the $9 I spent on it.\n\nEdit: I should address some of the criticism in the few negative reviews. I didn't feel like Poi \"ripped off\" Mario 64, although the influence is obvious. The gameplay is similar, but it has a different feel.\n\nThe worlds are rather small right now, although there's a decent amount to do in them. There are five worlds containing seven medallions each, and you can do most of the medallions out of order. There's also something like nine \"challenge levels\". Then you can get two extra medallions in the first four worlds by logging all their locations and unearthing all their fossils, respectively. (There are 16 locations and 16 fossils in each world.) I hope the devs expand them, as it is only early access, but the worlds definitely don't feel empty at all. \n\nI didn't find the music annoying, as it's long enough to be looped without driving you insane. In fact, I liked it. \n\nThe enemies were only recently implemented. They can be super annoying, especially the mole things that chuck rocks at you. But they're pretty on par with other games of this type, and they add both challenge and a source of coins/hearts. The devs have mentioned that they are going to be re-balancing the game's difficulty at some point, so they may change this. (Oh, that's another thing - difficulty tends toward the easy side for 3D platformers, but not ridiculously so.)\n\nIn the same update, they added one friendly native race to each world.

Don't get me wrong, those are fine games especially GTA, but when thats all there is outside of the realm of sports games, its nice to see something a little different. With that in mind, Poi.\n\nPoi is a modern take on mascot platformers, especially Mario 64 and Sunshine which feel the most like Poi does in terms of graphics, level design and gameplay asthetics. But it still has enough going on to warrent a purchase on its own rather than just reminding people about how good those games were. The graphics and sound do harken back to that era of platformer and can feel a bit like it's pandering towards player's sense of nostalgia but it doesn't feel patronizing. The levels follow that traditional theme pattern that was common in old platformers, Forest World, Fire World, Sand World, Ice World and Cave World. However, at this stage they feel a bit plain where the complexity of the levels is skin deep and their gimmick gets old fast, especially when you're trying to get all the fossils and locations. Hopefully the levels get more fleshed out in the final version.\n\nMoving to gameplay, and right off the bat, the jumping feels amazing, like one of the best jumping mechanics I've ever seen in a platformer. While it might not look that great graphically, I've been able to pull off some awesome jumps that look as cool as they feel to pull off with a great level of precision. If Playkid ever decides to make a parkour game, I'd be all over it because they know how to make great controls.\n\nGameplay wise, it follows the collectathon standards of 90s mascot platformers, where progression is determined by collecting everything and it can be addicting at times. The big problem is that there isnt a lot on offer right now. Five somewhat small levels and a bunch of really fun challenge stages. In the three hours I've played of it, I probably completed about 70% of the game and seen pretty much everything the game has to offer in its current state. Obviously it's still in Early Access but for a game that plays as well as it does, the fact that there's so little annoys me.\n\nCompared to a lot of Early Access games, which expects people to pay money for something that wouldn't be acceptable on Newgrounds or Kongregate, let alone a game that costs money on Steam (coughKimulatorcough),  Poi has a lot of really great elements that show how much effort the team at PlayKid is putting towards the game. However, I can't recommend it at full price based on the content availible right now. If you can get it during a sale like I did, it's worth it. Otherwise, put it on your wishlist and wait for launch. Its still worth playing, even at this state, but doesn't yet have the content to justify it's $15 price tag.\n\n[i]Unelected Game Reviews:\nBeats Being an Anime Fan on Prom Night [/i]", "timestamp_created": 1467519014, "timestamp_updated": 1467519014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496719", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23812923": {"recommendationid": "23812923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006888427", "num_games_owned": 4610, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498689383}, "language": "english", "review": "This seems like a nintendo Original game!

Jumping is spot on and all the other basic manuevers work. Where it's lacking is that it just isn't much fun. This mostly boils down to level design, which is weak throughout. The looping music quickly gets annoying as well. The recent inclusion of enemies has been implemented awfully. In games like this they should just bumble around and be available for necessary coins or hearts. Here they actively cheaply attack you by burrowing underground, throwing objects, or not being contacted properly when being landed on. These enemies are really the only challenging aspect of the game. The platforming is ridiculously easy, and grows tiresome quickly. It only makes sense that the main character(s) would be just as dull as the rest of the game. \n\nI understand people are hungry for games from the genre that has been brought back from the dead, but I would pass on this one.. for now at least.

Since then, the devs at Polykid have added Snowland, home to some delightful penguins, as well as a second explorer girl who will give you tips and pop up in levels for a game of hide n' seek. \n\nOnce on the ground, your explorer controls fast and precisely. You're able to do a Super Mario 64-style triple jump (NOT jumping three times in the air), a backflip jump, a roll, a rolling jump, wall- and triangle-jumps, etc. They control really well; it's very responsive and they transition between animations - like going from running to balancing on a beam, climbing on a ladder or grabbing a ledge - super quickly and smoothly. Like a great classic 3D Platformer, it's a joy just to move around in these levels with these characters. Beyond the platforming, you have a few gadgets that can be purchased from the Old Man, like a telescope or a shovel. They're nothing earth shattering, but they add a little bit more to the levels, and help drive home that sense that you're exploring these locales for items and points of interest. \n\nThe levels are large, wide and totally open - this is not modern-style super linear \"3D Platforming\" like Mario 3D World or Ratchet & Clank. No Point A to Point B, follow the path, \"nothing to see over here\"-nonsense. Go wherever you want, explore! You don't even have fall damage, because that would just get in the way. Find medallions even if they're not for the mission you've selected! Hit switches you find to open up a new portion of the level! There's a lot of verticality to the levels, for lots of climbing opportunities. There are also stage hazards like moving platforms, bounce ropes, climbing walls, etc. The way everything's laid out, it's all just very engaging to traverse. \n\nWhen the game launched, there were no enemies, so it was purely just a platforming challenge (barring the occasional rolling boulders or electrified gears-on-ropes). Since then though, the devs have started populating the levels with simple little baddies and NPC's, so levels are even better now. They're starting to feel less barren and more of full of life in general. The enemies are extremely simple to take out - without any combat moves, you just jump on their head - but they add to the experience all the same. \n\n--\nThe whole game feels great, is super charming & whimsical, and is just plain fun - everything a great 3D Platformer should be! It may not have the looks of something like Yooka Laylee, but it definitely deserves your attention if you're a fan of the genre, especially for this price. If you're worried about it feeling incomplete or not ever getting finished due to it's status in Early Access, I wouldn't worry about it - there's plenty here already to entertain for hours, and as I've said before, Polykid has been updating this pretty regularly. There's a sense of progression in place already and it's clear there's an endgoal in sight (literally; one of the updates has introduced a mysterious island with 4 locked doors that we'll eventually gain access to through a future update).\n \nPick this up; it's an absolute joy to play that you're guaranteed to have fun with!", "timestamp_created": 1464644452, "timestamp_updated": 1464764898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23259529": {"recommendationid": "23259529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302081059", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465414856}, "language": "german", "review": "Also das ist die erste Review die ich schreibe, aber zu dieser Early Access muss das sein.\n\nHabe jetzt das 49.

Instead of free roam, each level has you select a medallion to go for which can alter how the level is designed. An example is the Crystal Cavern level where the first medallion you collect will turn on the lights and power, which will cause all future medallions to be in a lit cavern with running machinery. Each level has six medallions to find, where four of them are in unique areas sometimes requiring you to solve a puzzle, while two others just require you to either collect 100 coins or 7 keys to make them appear. Each medallion will record how long it takes you to collect it, and this time can be used to compete with other players to see who can collect them the fastest.\n\nCollecting coins during levels lets you buy explorer tools and unlock challenge levels. Tools include a shovel that lets you collect fossils found in levels, and a compass that will show important objects in a level. Challenges are just short levels that have a unique set of obstacles and just requires you to reach the medallion at the end of the level. There are no coins or anything else in challenge levels, but competing with other players for the shortest time is what will bring you back to them.\n\nYour character is very simple, who can easily run and jump around. There isn\u2019t anything special about walking and running, but jumping comes in a variety of styles. Your standard jump can be extended by double jumps, and jumping in succession after hitting the ground first will cause future jumps to go even higher. Wall jumping is also present, where you can jump back and forth between two walls that are fairly close to each other.\n\n\n                            [h1]Should You Play Poi?[/h1]\n\n[b]Casual(Easy):[/b] Quite possibly one of the easiest games that you can buy, it is an excellent choice if you don\u2019t want much of a challenge. However, it may actually be too easy even if that is what you\u2019re looking for.\n\n[b]Casual(Quick Play Sessions):[/b] Your progress is always being saved and most medallions and challenge levels only take a few minutes to complete.\n\n[b]Hardcore:[/b] Even the hardest medallions and challenge levels require very little skill, so the only thing that hardcore gamers will like is speedrunning through levels to become number one on the highscores.\n\n[b]Children:[/b] Just the art style alone makes it clear that it is a game that children will enjoy. On top of that, the lack of difficulty also makes it a perfect game for younger ones to play.\n\n[b]Longevity:[/b] Collecting most medallions and playing through the challenge levels will take you between 1-2 hours. Finding everything in each world can make the game last a few more hours, while speedrunning medallions and competing for high scores can make the game last even longer.\n\n\n                        [h1]State of the Game[/h1]\n\n[b]Options:[/b] The settings menu is very simple; with basic volume sliders, graphical options, and camera sensitivity. While it does show controls you aren\u2019t able to change them, but the game is simple enough that it isn\u2019t a problem.\n\n[b]Optimization:[/b] Poi has simple cartoony graphics and runs well on any modern computer. Loading into the hub and levels happens almost instantly so you never have to sit and wait to play.\n\n[b]Audio:[/b] The level selection hub and levels all have their own unique music to listen to. There are characters in the game but there is no voice acting of any kind.\n\n[b]Operation:[/b] You will be controlling your character in third person while you are exploring levels. The camera can be freely moved around as you explore and can also be zoomed in and out, but it will sometimes be controlled automatically in some areas and may cause the camera to be in a bad location. Jumping can be a little odd at times, especially when you are in areas with walls and slippery slopes. This is especially noticeable when you miss a platform or something and as long as you simply touch something, you regain the ability to do a double jump.\n\n[b]Completion:[/b] The mechanics of the game appear to be complete, which means it's just content that needs to be added. There will be additional explorer tools that can eventually be bought in the store, allowing for more things to be collected in the levels. New worlds and challenge levels will also come in future updates.\n\n\n                     [h1]Personal Thoughts[/h1]\n\nI grew up playing many of the collect-athon platformer series including Super Mario, Donkey Kong, Banjo-Kazooie, Jak and Daxter, and many others. You very rarely see games like them these days which is a shame. While there are still many platformers of all kinds being made, Poi is probably the only current one in 3-D that focuses on exploration and collecting objects. Unfortunately, there are big things keeping it from being as enjoyable as the classics.\n\nThe main thing is that it is simply too easy and simple. Most medallions only take a few minutes at most to reach, and the paths and \"puzzles\" needed to reach them barely require much thought. Being easy is one thing, but the game is riddled with tons of hints on top of that. There's even an item you can buy that will show you where most stuff is hidden, making exploration almost pointless. Combat is non-existant(which isn't a necessity) and you will almost never die in the game. Even if you do happen to die, checkpoints are located right before \"hard\" areas so you're right back at the spot.\n\nThe older games had tons of other mechanics besides jumping around and gathering items, which is pretty much the only thing to do in Poi. It's not that collecting items is boring, but having them do something or have meaning is very important. Collecting coins lets you unlock challenge levels and buy explorer tools, but you can buy everything very quickly and coins become pointless afterwards. It would be nice to see more of what was in platformers of the past.\n\nWhen I think about it, just a single level from a classic 3-D platformer, such as the Bob-omb Battlefield from Super Mario 64, had more depth and entertainment than the whole of what currently exists in Poi, and that is saying something. The first star that you go after requires you to climb a mountain and defeat a boss, all the while you are; exploring a battlefield that has a variety of enemies, cannons that shoot you into the sky, wing caps that let you fly, secret areas to find, rolling balls that need to be avoided on the climb up, and more. Yet in Poi, the first medallion just requires you to barely travel into the level and simply flip a switch, which causes platforms to move and you're already at the medallion.\n\n\n[h1]When to Buy Poi[/h1]\n\n[b]Price:[/b] Poi currently costs 15 dollars on Steam, and is likely to increase as it nears completion. This is a lot of money for the amount of content currently available in Poi, and if you're looking for a game with some kind of difficulty or depth, then it definitely isn't worth your money.\n\n[b]Involvement:[/b] As there is very little story, there is no problem at all to get involved in the game while it is still being developed. It is very unlikely that your progress in the game will be reset, and if anything the time highscores on each level will be reset if big changes are ever made.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] You should only consider buying Poi if you're looking for a simple platformer game and don't want much else.\n\n\nRead more reviews like this at http://www.ratsplat.com\n\nFollow my curator list for future early access game recommendations:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/6856568-Should-You-Play-This-Game/", "timestamp_created": 1459404281, "timestamp_updated": 1459404492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592555", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22112768": {"recommendationid": "22112768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096084918", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482171073}, "language": "french", "review": "Poi is a colorfull mordern Mario !

The overall feel of the game is not unlike that of Super Mario 64 however this game controls significantly more smoothly. On the subject of Mario 64, the jumping mechanics come mostly from that game, but with the added double jump for an extra layer of precision added to your platforming. The worlds are all fun to explore, and, to add a little icing to this cake, the game rewards said exploration with its experience system used to progress the game. Your goal in the game is to become a master explorer by leveling up your character by exploring levels, finding collectables, and completing miniature challenge levels. The main collectable of the game being Explorer Medals, which there are six of per level and worth 100 EXP apiece. Getting these explorer medals is done by completing missions within the levels, but, on top of these, there are also hidden fossils that you can dig up for 50 EXP apiece, treasure chests with many coins hidden within little secret caves in the levels, and several points of interest to be found within each level that are worth 25 EXP for finding them. EXP is, of course, used to increase your explorer level, and, as your level increases, your mentor will allow you to enter more dangerous levels within the game. Unlike most platformers, your common coin collectable actually serves a purpose beyond collecting them for the sake of collecting them as they allow you to purchase explorer tools and can be spent to unlock miniature one-off challenge levels such as going down a huge slide where you need to collect seven keys or reach the explorer medal at the end of a series of falling platforms. As for problems I currently see, I hope future levels have more hazards within them. With the exception of the fourth level, Crystal Caverns, I didn't really find the main levels to be too threatening. On top of this, I feel as though the main character will ready a wall jump no matter what angle you jump towards a wall at which prompts some saves from falling that, really, should NOT have happened (Particularly when following up this wall jump with the aforementioned double jump). Another thing, while this isn't necessarily a complaint, is that I hope that the explorer tools can be more incorporated into the levels more. Among the three explorer tools currently within the game, I only found myself using the shovel with any form of frequency. Overall, this game shows a great deal of promise as a return to 3d platformers of old, and I looked forward to future versions of this game.

You'll be retreading territory several times in each level to get all the collectables, but it's done in a tasteful way with mutliple paths through the levels. The collectables don't overstay their welcome, while still having a good amount to collect. If anything, I think the purchasble item prices need a buff. The \"overworld\" is also fun to explore, even if you don't spend all that much time there. Controlls are intuitive and some moves that aren't explicity explained come naturally. The graphics may not work for some peoples' tastes, but I like it. The music and sound effects are also very nice. \n\nMy biggest gripe is that only a couple medallions can be collected while being able to coninue in the level. Some medallions (the 100 coin one in particular) can be picked up with the option to continue, but others force you to the overworld. I understand that this is to facilitate barriers, but if I can see three medallions in my current area (100 coin, keys, and objective), I'd like to pick up all of them in one go. \n\nPros \n+Level design\n+Music\n+Graphics\n+Controlls (finally a game that's not super floaty!)\n+Fun challenges beyond the core gameplay\n+Reasonable camera - I don't find myself fighting it like in so many other games\n\nCons\n-Multiple objectives in the same area can't all be collected at the same time\n-Some people may not like retreading old ground, though I'm completely fine with this implementation\n-Doesn't play nice with antivirus programs yet\n\nThis is still early access, so anything could change. As it is now, this game is worh every penny and then some. There's so few games in the vein of Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie on PC that this is a breath of fresh air. I haven't run into any enemies yet, but this game ticks all the other boxes so I'll live wihout the action part of an action-platformer. I've only written a few reviews, and I'm super in on this game. I'm looking forward to continued development.

Thankfully there has been a resurgence in that genre among indie developers. I had been somewhat patiently following the development of games like Clive and Wrench, Freeze Me, A Hat In Time and others but none of them had a release date. I searched the Steam Store for 3D platformer, but couldn't find what I was looking for. Then I decided to search YouTube for Steam 3D Platformers and Poi was one of the first entries. I noticed that I missed the Kickstarter and that it hadn't reached it's funding and I was worried that meant I would never get to play it and it looked gorgeous. I decided to try my luck searching for it on Steam and found that it was available in Early Access. I bought it immediately. \n\nI've been burned by games before so I was cautiously optimistic as I was loading it up, but thankfully this game was everything I was hoping for. Not only is art style gorgeous, clean and bright, but the characters I've met in the games seem like they would be right at home in the best first party Nintendo games. Their animations and way of speaking appear to be heavily influenced by Zelda.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any enemies in the game (this is no longer the case), and yet I don't miss them. This game is a 3D platformer in its purest form. All of the thrill and the challenge comes from traversing the detailed environments which have several paths just like Super Mario 64. In fact, one of the first things I thought when I began to play the game was \"I have been waiting for a game like this since Mario 64.\" As much as I love the Mario Galaxy games and the 3D Land/World games, none of them managed to recapture the feeling that I got when playing Mario 64. Poi has managed to recreate that feeling almost perfectly. \n\nI haven't completed the game, and it's early access so for all I know there is no end yet (I don't really know how early access works as this is the first time I've bought a game in early access) but I have faith that they will deliver one of the best 3D platforming experiences since the glory days of the N64.", "timestamp_created": 1451411350, "timestamp_updated": 1485019232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494321", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20047596": {"recommendationid": "20047596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131252662", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490996916}, "language": "english", "review": "Umm...

To get medallions, you need to complete different types of objectives like obstacle platforming, or exploration.\nBy grabbing medallions, digging up fossils, or finding secret locations you gain xp and level up your character in order to gain access to the next level.\n\nThe gameplay borrows a lot of abilities from many old platformers such as double jump, timing your jump as soon as you land will give you a higher second jump, you can wall jump etc.\nThe controls feel very tight, which is very important for a game like this. Whenever you die, it's your fault.\n\nThere are a few \"challenge\" levels that you can play in addition to the main levels. Things like obstacle courses and timed challenges, they're actually very fun.\n\nMy main issue with the game was that after collecting a medallion, you're taken back to the hub world, and thus lose your progress on any other collectibles you had been collecting in the levels. I'd love the option to teleport to the hub or stay and continue clearing out the level if I'd like to.\n\nOverall, it's a great game!

Sometimes I'll pause just to look around and figure out \"How do I get over to that area?\", even if there's no goal for me to get there. The most recent world seems to be ramping up the difficulty, so I look forward very much to the upcoming ones.\n\nThe only thing I wish is for there to be more content - more worlds, larger worlds, even just a world editor.

The game is clearly still early access, some textures look weird here and there, some glictching and even annoying gameplay elements. However this hasn't crashed even once and there haven't been a single one gameplay ruining bug or glitch. So overall the game works surprisingly well on an older laptop, full controller support is nice and the graphical style is kind of okay. Can't really tell until developed further.\n\nThe stuff I don't like are that not all the things you collect aren't persistent. When you go back to a map you can collect the same coins again and again. The thing that made me play all the Spyros to the 100% (or to 120%) was that there was a shit load of stuff, but all that stuff could be collected leading to some of the most amazing adventures in gaming I've had. The second one is the speed of the character's movement and falling down. I'll use Ratchet & Clank as another example, the movement of the character is extremely smooth all over wich makes even the most intense moments feel good to handle. And the \"jump after you hit the ground\" seems just unnecessary, I would prefer a some kind of powerup for the higher jumps than just walking for a few meters up and down. Final thing I don't like is that when you complete a mission you have to leave the map. This gets very annoying when wanting to get a map to 100% before advancing (there are over 5 missions per map).\n\nI would love an answer from the developers regarding the stuff mentioned above, is there any major changes or improvements coming?\n\nOverall seems to be going in to a great direction and I had fun with it so I'll definitely recommend it, however at this moment I'd give it something like 6/10.", "timestamp_created": 1449345412, "timestamp_updated": 1449345412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539222", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19503502": {"recommendationid": "19503502", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031327454", "num_games_owned": 623, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449000478}, "language": "english", "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUhaRFzPSyk", "timestamp_created": 1449330589, "timestamp_updated": 1449330589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19451592": {"recommendationid": "19451592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087336538", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497151394}, "language": "english", "review": "A promising start to a 3d platformer in the vein of Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie.  Right now there are two fairly simple worlds, but the foundation is there for a solid game.  You can choose to play as a boy or a girl, and after a short tutorial level you take a ship into the sky.\n\nThe sky hub world reminiscent of Zelda: Skyward Sword with various floating islands.  World selection is done by rotating the ships wheel, which takes you to a select screen like Mario 64, though like Mario 64 you can find the medals out of order.  Medals are their version of stars, keys are their version of red coins, and there is a medal for collecting 100 coins in a world.  The only downside is, like Mario 64, the game pops you out of a world each time you collect a medal.  There are no changes between \"acts\" like the 3D Mario games, so there isn't a compelling reason for this.  Collectibles and objectives for medals reset, so if you prefer to explore at your leisure rather than following the objective the game sets for you, you may find yourself partway through earning multiple medals as you're exploring only to have to choose one and restart the others.  I would prefer it to be more like Banjo-Kazooie and leave you in the world to keep exploring.\n\nYou can also spend time exploring to fill up the journal with locations and fossils. Doing these things gets you experience to level up, which is the way this game opens up new worlds.  In the hub world you can use coins to purchase special abilities.

Diff\u00e9rents mondes, divers d\u00e9fis, des personnages \u00e0 rencontrer, tout cela s'annonce prometteur ! Mais qu'en est-il r\u00e9ellement ? Les joueurs auraient-ils raison de miser sur Poi ?[/i]\n\nLe sc\u00e9nario est succinct, vous r\u00eavez de devenir un explorateur et pour y parvenir vous allez visiter des mondes et passer des \u00e9preuves. Vous pourrez choisir entre incarner un gar\u00e7on ou une fille et apr\u00e8s un bref [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=552554337]tutoriel[/url] vous apprenant \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser des doubles sauts ou \u00e0 jouer aux \u00e9quilibristes sur une corde, vous voil\u00e0 lanc\u00e9s !\n\nD'embl\u00e9e Poi s'av\u00e8re \u00eatre tr\u00e8s plaisant, un capital sympathie se d\u00e9gage directement de ce jeu et on a envie de l'aimer imm\u00e9diatement. On se retrouve sur un bateau volant et on va se diriger vers le premier monde disponible : Cozy Canyon. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=552632078 Vous devrez alors atteindre des sommets pour r\u00e9colter des cl\u00e9s ou des pi\u00e8ces, explorer des grottes, activer des m\u00e9canismes...etc. Outre ces missions quelque peu classiques d'un jeu de plateformes vous pourrez aussi chercher les fossiles diss\u00e9min\u00e9s sur l'\u00eele et les d\u00e9terrer \u00e0 l'aide de la pelle achet\u00e9e chez le marchand ou explorer afin de d\u00e9couvrir tous les lieux cach\u00e9s. On passera donc une \u00e0 deux heures sur ce premier monde selon si on veut le compl\u00e9ter \u00e0 100% ou juste r\u00e9colter suffisamment de badges d'explorateurs pour passer au monde suivant.\n\nLe second monde, Mount Magma, est plus dangereux et les 3 vies dont nous disposons trouveront leur utilit\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de notre arriv\u00e9e sur le volcan en \u00e9ruption. La difficult\u00e9 est donc accrue et il faudra faire plus attention lors de notre collecte de pi\u00e8ces par exemple car mourir remettra le compteur \u00e0 z\u00e9ro. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=552632759 A nouveau comptez une \u00e0 deux heures pour venir \u00e0 bout de la plupart des missions de ce monde l\u00e0. Il faudra attendre que le d\u00e9veloppement progresse avant de pouvoir explorer une autre \u00eele.\n\nOn peut alors se dire qu'il n'y a rien de bien extraordinaire chez ce jeu. En effet les qu\u00eates sont assez basiques mais le jeu voulant s'inscrire dans un genre classique cela est tout \u00e0 fait justifi\u00e9. Personnellement j'ai ador\u00e9 cet aper\u00e7u de Poi et j'ai h\u00e2te de voir la suite d'autant que le jeu ne semble pas \u00e0 court d'id\u00e9es. Outre l'ajout de nouveaux mondes il y aura aussi de nouveaux outils d'explorateurs qui pourront donc justifier le retour dans les mondes d\u00e9j\u00e0 explor\u00e9s pendant l'acc\u00e8s anticip\u00e9 pour compl\u00e9ter de nouvelles qu\u00eates. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=553280026 De plus certains d\u00e9fis pourront \u00eatre ajout\u00e9s \u00e0 ceux qui sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 disponibles (ascension d'une tour mouvante, glissade dans la neige, rouleau comportant des pics \u00e0 franchir...) et permettre de se mesurer \u00e0 d'autres joueurs gr\u00e2ce aux classements.\n\nGraphiquement parlant on peux dire que Poi s'inscrit dans la lign\u00e9e des jeux auxquels il entend rendre hommage. Les techniques employ\u00e9es datent, les textures sont pauvres, les d\u00e9tails absents mais l'univers dans sa globalit\u00e9 est agr\u00e9able et le plaisir de jeu surpasse largement ces d\u00e9boires visuels. Mieux, on a l'impression de jouer \u00e0 jeu un peu oldie et on retrouve l'esprit d'un platformer de la belle \u00e9poque. Il y a toutefois un aspect que Poi maitrise all\u00e8grement : les [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=552632327]animations[/url] sont r\u00e9ussies et vari\u00e9es (double saut, plongeon, position en \u00e9quilibre, accrochage au bord d'une plateforme...). Autant de d\u00e9tails qui contribuent au plaisir de jeu que l'on \u00e9prouve en r\u00e9solvant les qu\u00eates de Poi. La bande-son est quant \u00e0 elle dans le m\u00eame esprit classique avec des tons enjou\u00e9s, propices \u00e0 l'aventure.\n\nIl convient aussi de parler des quelques d\u00e9fauts du jeu. Dans un premier temps, j'ai trouv\u00e9 \u00e9trange qu'apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 un badge d'exploration je sois automatiquement renvoy\u00e9 sur le bateau servant de QG. Ainsi si vous aviez commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9colter des cl\u00e9s pour l'autre badge tout sera remis \u00e0 z\u00e9ro lorsque vous reviendrez. Deuxi\u00e8mement, alors qu'il est possible d'atteindre d'autres bateau volants en [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=552632533]parachute[/url], le maniement de ce dernier n'est pas tr\u00e8s ais\u00e9. Pour le moment ce sont les seuls d\u00e9fauts que j'ai trouv\u00e9. Le d\u00e9veloppement du jeu est fait avec beaucoup de s\u00e9rieux et de soin.\n\nAu final, Poi a toutes les cl\u00e9s d'un super jeu de plateformes 3D en main. Il reste encore \u00e0 ajouter un peu de contenu, au moins deux mondes suppl\u00e9mentaires et \u00e0 corriger quelques probl\u00e8mes mineurs et on aura l\u00e0 une vrai perle ! \n\n[quote]Depuis sa sortie en version finale, Poi s'est vu enrichi par du contenu non n\u00e9gligeable. Outre le fait que vous avez d\u00e9sormais acc\u00e8s \u00e0 quatre mondes, vous aurez aussi droit \u00e0 de petits mondes bonus et des d\u00e9fis suppl\u00e9mentaires. Si cela ne vous suffit pas, rassurez-vous, vous aurez au total plus d'une centaine de m\u00e9dailles \u00e0 r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer, une cinquantaine d'objets \u00e0 chercher, une trentaine de fossiles \u00e0 d\u00e9terrer et plus d'une soixantaine de lieux cach\u00e9s \u00e0 explorer. Sans parler de l'ajout d'ennemis qui vous compliqueront bien la t\u00e2che et du New Game+ pour refaire le jeu en mode \"miroir\" avec un seul c\u0153ur \u00e0 disposition.

All your favorite moves from Mario are here, walljumps, triplejumps, slidejumps, quickturn backflips, the works. Not only does it feel familiar but was very responsive as well. Didn't test keyboard and mouse as it's more a gamepad based game. After clearing the tutorial you progress into the main world, which currently consists of a 'hub' containing 2 full maps and an npc who sells unlockable mini challenges. All included global scoreboards for those adventurers seeking further glory. While Zelda had a boat, Poi has an airship and your character has a deployable parachute! Yes, you don't technically fly very far but effects are in place to make it feel both believable and magical.\n\nTechnically speaking, Poi should run a range of systems, supporting screen resolutions of 4k+ and toggles for godrays, depth-of-field and heat-haze, Controls were intuitive but unfortunately unable to be remapped. Probably the games biggest flaw at the moment is the lack of content, veterans could complete what it offers in under 2hrs.

The hub of the game sees you on a sky ship able to visit different worlds that contain a number of different medallions to collect. If you replace stars with medallions, red coins with keys and coins with\u2026 coins you pretty much know what to expect.\n\nCurrently in the early access build there are 2 different worlds to explore both of which have 6 medallions. Cozy Canyon is a forest mountain level and Mount Magma is a lava style volcano level. While there is currently nothing super original this is most definitely one of the best 3D platformers I have played in years. After completing the 2 worlds I was left desperate for more and cannot wait for the game to reach further in development.\n\nEarly in the game you also meet a passing ship that can transport you to challenge levels that really kick the difficulty up a notch. There are also other things to do such as dig for fossils and with other detours looking to be added soon there is a bright future.\n\nVisually the game looks like an early Dreamcast title but do not let this put you off. Steam is flooded with 2D retro platformers as the moment so to have a 3D one that captures the spirit of platformers from the N64 era so very well is an exciting prospect.\n\nIf you yearn for a N64 inspired 3D platformer the Poi is definitely an early access title worth keeping an eye on.\n\nCheck our video review here: http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-examines/151108_game-tutor-examines-poi\n\nFor the Purpose of Disclosure the Steam Key was provided by the developer.

However, I don't need to be a platformer enthusiast to know just how good of a game this is. \n\nTL;DR:\nIf you like banjo kazooie or Super mario 64 you'll enjoy this game. This game has a good and fluid movement, fun visuals, and a surprisingly good soundtrack.\nCompared to others of the genre: 8/10 \nMy opinion as someone who doesn't particularly love the genre: 7/10\n\nThis game is an amazing work made by (I could be wrong) only 4 people, and as you play it you can tell that they poured their hearts into their work. The game plays like Super Mario 64 or Banjo Kazooie and you can tell how the designers reminisced back to these classics while rendering their own beautiful game world.\n\nThe characters are cute and colorful with good voice queues matched to their movements that keep the game engaging and dont stick out as annoying or out of place. Additionally you are able to play as either the boy or the girl in case you prefer one's model, voice queues, or just to play one gender over the other.\n\nThe movement in the game is all very smooth and responsive and between your wall jumps, double jumps, super jumps, backwards vaults, dives, rolls and edge grabs you can find many solutions to the different puzzles the game throws at you. These are just a start as their are plenty other situational mechanics to make your way around the maps as well.\n\nThe music in this game is astoundingly good especially for having (once again to my knowledge) one man behind it all. Lyndon Holland did an incredible job with the soundtrack of this game truly enhancing the vibes and experience overall. The airship music for instance (probably my favorite) just creates such a sense of adventure that I never knew I could feel in whats basically a glorified map selection menu.\n\nThe camera is pretty unproblematic, when unadjusted it smoothly follows your character model slightly swiveling to adjust for the direction you face or to avoid obstructing walls and objects. When manually moved with the right joystick its exactly how youd expect it to act, giving you full control of your view while still avoiding obstructing walls.\n\nI think for someone who loves 3D platformers especially the older marios that you would find a great deal of fun and replayability from this game. Its very suited to speed runs and has plenty of creativity for players to find their own solutions to be proud of. For those who aren't really fans of 3D platformers, you may still enjoy it but perhaps wait for a sale as those who arent planning to replay to speedrun or discover fun new maneuvers probably wont get more than 4-5 hours out of this game.\n\nAs a 3D platformer: 8/10 \nMy personal feelings, not being a huge fan of the genre: 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1516392642, "timestamp_updated": 1516392774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 466, "total_negative": 42, "total_reviews": 508}}

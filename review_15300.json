There are two different types of soldiers: Standard which are the most disposable things ever and Specialists who are achieved only by completing optional secondary mission objectives. All fall in the class of Assault, Support, Sniper and Demolitions with only a pair of the last three available with Standard at a time 6 being the maximum deployment size. Equipment selection is brought to a minimal with only two pieces: primary weapon, secondary item, no armor selection and all soldiers with NVGs and Binoculars. The amount of primaries are very limited even with Specialists. Secondaries include the (suppressed) M9 pistol, grenade launcher attachments, 2 remote claymores and 6 hand grenades, 2 motion sensors (similar to heartbeat but have to be placed down), extra ammo and exclusive to Demolitions the anti-tank rocket launcher and timed explosive which both are required to complete some mission objectives.\n\nSecond team skills. Remember how each Rainbow operative had like 10 different stats despite some not being so important and each started medium to high, would increase a little if they survived a mission and if they died would be replaced only once with someone with a significantly lower amount of skill. In this game there are 4 different stats: Weapon, Stealth, Leadership and Endurance. Each of these can be filled with a maximum of 8 points each. Standards always start out with a total of 7 or 8 points with no skill ever starting with over 2 points and if they survived the mission everyone who took part gets 1 point to put on whichever skill the player wants. The problem is this does not make much diversity in selecting a team because chances are your Standard soldier will die before they make a bell curve on their skills; it is much harder for them to get wounded and it felt like you are using the Replacement Rainbow operatives even sometimes with Specialists.\nEndurance which wasn't in R6 is the increased chance that if a soldier is hit they will get wounded.\n\nThird planning and controls. Before and during a mission you are given a full layout of the map with objectives marked. So what about planning? There isn't any like in R6, instead during the mission you have to hold down the map button to select your teams waypoints, engagement options and movement options all while the game still goes on making it risky to send backup if you are engaged. The controls calling All Teams Go/Hold and switching teams/operatives was also complicated. And I guess you can also do the equivalent of Alpha, Bravo, Charlie movements by getting teams in positions, place on hold, mark waypoints moments before you will execute them then command \"Advance at All Costs\" but that never got to me.\n\nIf you like Rainbow Six without the long planning then perhaps this is okay. I also found it more simple using only two teams than three and you can save as much as you want during missions. But being the same price as other Rainbow Six games I would recommend those first over this.\n", "timestamp_created": 1514594368, "timestamp_updated": 1514594368, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.257521", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38564313": {"recommendationid": "38564313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061704578", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514610575}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e19\u0e35\u0e48\u0e04\u0e37\u0e2d Ghost Recon \u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e14\u0e35\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e14 \u0e16\u0e49\u0e32\u0e17\u0e35\u0e21 Redstorm \u0e40\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e01\u0e25\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e21\u0e32 Reboot \u0e43\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e48\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e08\u0e30\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e02\u0e49\u0e32\u0e21\u0e28\u0e15\u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e29\u0e41\u0e19\u0e48\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e19\n\n\u0e02\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e35\n-\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e08\u0e23\u0e34\u0e07\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e46 \u0e42\u0e14\u0e19\u0e22\u0e34\u0e07\u0e17\u0e35\u0e40\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e31\u0e1a\n-\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e27\u0e32\u0e07\u0e41\u0e1c\u0e19\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e17\u0e33\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e25\u0e30\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e35\u0e22\u0e14\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e14\u0e46 \u0e2a\u0e31\u0e48\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e17\u0e35\u0e21\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e23\u0e32\u0e22\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22\n-\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e22\u0e31\u0e07\u0e42\u0e04\u0e15\u0e23\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e01\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e22\u0e46 \u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e43\u0e19\u0e22\u0e38\u0e04\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e14\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22\u0e0b\u0e49\u0e33\n-\u0e02\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e35\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e14\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e04\u0e37\u0e2d \u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e21\u0e32\u0e23\u0e16\u0e2a\u0e25\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e21\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e17\u0e38\u0e01\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e44\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e48\u0e01\u0e47\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\n-\u0e14\u0e39 Replay \u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e48\u0e32\u0e07\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e30\u0e17\u0e38\u0e01\u0e21\u0e38\u0e21\u0e01\u0e25\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e17\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e21\u0e38\u0e21\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e04\u0e04\u0e25\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48 1 \u0e2b\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d 3\n-\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e23\u0e22\u0e32\u0e01\u0e32\u0e28\u0e43\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e01\u0e14\u0e14\u0e31\u0e19\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e08\u0e23\u0e34\u0e07\u0e08\u0e31\u0e07\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e46\n-\u0e28\u0e31\u0e15\u0e23\u0e39\u0e09\u0e25\u0e32\u0e14\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e04\u0e31\u0e0d\u0e22\u0e34\u0e07\u0e42\u0e04\u0e15\u0e23\u0e41\u0e21\u0e48\u0e19\n\n\u0e02\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e22\n-\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e15\u0e01\u0e22\u0e38\u0e04\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e40\u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e07 \u0e40\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e32\u0e30\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e21\u0e35\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e22\u0e38 17 \u0e1b\u0e35\u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e19\u0e30", "timestamp_created": 1514011823, "timestamp_updated": 1514011823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38546597": {"recommendationid": "38546597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064448288", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513970492}, "language": "english", "review": "Control with a keyboard?

They dont make games like they used to.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwLIHqkqHcw", "timestamp_created": 1513716089, "timestamp_updated": 1513716089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.656250", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40964664": {"recommendationid": "40964664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120286258", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452211236}, "language": "english", "review": "I used to be the king of this game back when xbox live first came out.

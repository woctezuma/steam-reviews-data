In theory, it's great, and the first few levels are really fun, however in my opinion, several design choices make the game less enjoyable and more frustrating.\n\nTo start off, rhythms and beats quickly become more complex and require you to learn and memorize the pattern.  That would be fine if it weren't for the fact that every time you mess up, the rhythm becomes distored and static sounding for a few seconds, so when you respawn, you have no idea where you are in the rhythm and essentially have to relearn the beat over again.  When you partner that with some beats that alternate, it can make certain parts very frustrating and never really gave me a sense of accomplishment when I managed to pass it.\n\nSecondly, you have to not only memorize the beat, but have to also focus on platforming around hazards.  The stationary ones are fine, but once you start getting to the hazards that move relative to the beat, it can get annoying as the moving hazards appear seemingly random in pattern, meaning that even if you have the pattern memorized and know the timing, you can still mess up purely because one of the balls that kill you on contact wasn't in the same position you expected it to be in.  Again, dying messes with your sense of rhythm, meaning sections like this can be very frustating to get through.\n\nThird, the bosses are a grab bag of good and bad ideas.  Most of them were enjoyable to go through and worked well with the beat.  Others seem to just be trying your patience.  Take the third boss for example,  it has 3 parts.  The first part introduces the mechanic, which is to aim your weapon at the right hazard before the beat makes you shoot while ignoring the decoy hazards.  The second part, changes it up by making your weapon rotate clockwise along with the beat, so you have to account for the beat rotating your weapon once/twice to aim properly.  These are fine.  The third part however, makes the fight borderline RNG, where along with essentially having a timer to decide where to aim and having to deal with the beat rotating your weapon, the hazards now spin as well.  They'll move a seemingly random amount of sides clockwise, so while having to focus on all that you had to do before, you now have to calculate exactly how many sides of rotation you have to account for on top of not knowing where exactly the hazard will be.

It's definitely recommended that you wear headphones, because different obstacles and platforms appear and disappear (or move out of your way) in time with the music playing in the background. You have to become familiar with all the sounds that make up the music, and you have to realize what sound is associated with each movement of a platform or obstacle. The platforming usually isn't too demanding, but the real difficulty lies in recognizing the patterns and making your jumps and movements accordingly. 140 is a really unique and interesting platforming experience, and for that reason, I would have to recommend this game. However, just one nitpick: Now, I've only made it to level 5, but unless this is a mechanic that is only in Level 5 and not in levels 6-8, it seems like there are no checkpoints in levels 5-8. This means that once you die in one of those levels, you have to go back to the level selection area and have to completely restart the level you were just in. I get that as a game goes on, the levels should get harder, but if this is the developers' attempt to make levels 5-8 harder, it just seems like a cheap and uninspired way to ramp up difficulty. Now, as I've said before, the difficulty in the game comes from recognizing the patterns and making your movements in time with the music, so you may say, \u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t be complaining about permadeath! All you have to do is recognize the patterns, so you should be able to complete the whole level with one life!\u201d But you can only see the obstacles and platforms on your screen, so there can be an obstacle blocking your way later in the level that you don\u2019t see until you\u2019re standing on a platform, and that platform\u2019s going to disappear, and oop, you\u2019re dead. I don't know. Maybe I'm being too nitpicky. Maybe it's just because I suck at platformers. Maybe other people who have played the game don't have the same problems with the later levels that I have. But I just know that for me, it's a pretty frustrating mechanic. But I mean, even with that nitpick, there are still the first four levels (which actually have checkpoints), and they're really fun, so I'd still recommend picking up this game.", "timestamp_created": 1502044547, "timestamp_updated": 1502044547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34014329": {"recommendationid": "34014329", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997232258", "num_games_owned": 483, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507752547}, "language": "english", "review": "1 Hour Backlog Challenge: \n\nThis game was the first of my attempt to put at least one hour into every game in my library. \nWas it worth the time? \n\nYes, very much so.

[/h1] [b](For now)![/b] \n\nThis is a beautiful beat platformer that sat in my library uninstalled for 3 years, now... I feel like a complete idiot. After completing Mirror Level 4 I can say that this game is just downright amazing. Levels that move and change to a beat and rhythm. Time your jumps and movement per the rhythm and move with solid tight controls. There is one issue with this game but it doesn't crop up until the very end of the game so unless you're a completionist this may seem like a perfect game in the end.\n\nI will get to the single issue I found in this later, as I cannot express enough how well literally EVERYTHING else was done in this game. There is no artificial difficulty, but the challenges will keep you engaged throughout the entire experience. The level design is spot on, allowing the beat and level actions to blend in a seamless way. The minimalist graphics is a near perfect experience allowing you to really get lost in the music. Then you have the music... YES! It is fantastic, for a beat platformer this had to have been one of the most crucial design points, and this delivers in all the levels. As stated before the controls are super, super tight. I never had an experience where the controls didn't respond to what I was putting in. \n\nThe One Issue: The hit box of your shape is always that... a box. You will shift between 3 forms, a circle, a triangle, and a square. It's kinda cool the first few times you look at it. Unfortunately, though, if you try for Mirror World Level 3 or higher this is going to screw you over plenty of times. Mirror 4 is the greatest example of this, in that you'll need to play some obstacles real close to make them easier, jumping or falling into high precision areas with perfect required timing. As you fall your triangle appears, but the whole square around you is still hittable. So, there are two equal right angled triangles that you can't see on either side of ONE of the points that can still kill you.\n\nWow, looking at it that seems like a long paragraph, but it's really the minimalist of issues. I still beat all the levels and had fun doing it the whole time. Like I said as well, you will run through 75% of the game and never even notice this is a thing, like complete obliviousness. I just want you to be aware of it before you have that confused look on your face like I did.\n\n9/10 for this game.

There is no sense of \"How could I possibly have known that was there waiting to kill me\". The bosses are interesting and varied, there is one at the end of each stage. The way to handle each one seemed intuitive to me, but surviving the fight the entire way through withgout dying on your first run is challenging,\n\nThe graphics are simple but the solid colors are kind of nice. The music is used really well in conjunction with the hazards in the game, in that they move/become safe in time with various musical queues. Everything fits the beat which is a nice touch, but osme of the later hazards will trip you up if you are not acustomed to off beats!\n\nThe one down side I found was the lack of menu, as it did take me a while to determine how to get the hell out of the game. There is literally no menu that I am aware of, so no volume, pause, etc. There isn't really a need for a pause function in this game as most of the time you will be seconds away from a spot you can safely leave your \"character\".\n\nSteam workshop for this game would be amazing, and help to extend the rather short playtime.", "timestamp_created": 1500545528, "timestamp_updated": 1500545528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33646922": {"recommendationid": "33646922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189037462", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514043354}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0438\u0442\u043c-\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440!", "timestamp_created": 1500452487, "timestamp_updated": 1511447035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33608327": {"recommendationid": "33608327", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262409322", "num_games_owned": 2556, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505134272}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u3002\u3002\u6211\u5feb\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u8282\u62cd\u5668\u4e86T__T\n", "timestamp_created": 1500299566, "timestamp_updated": 1500299566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585799", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33607627": {"recommendationid": "33607627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198359029380", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500302823}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8868\u56db\u5173\u5bf9\u4e8e\u666e\u901a\u73a9\u5bb6\u6765\u8bf4\u8fd8\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u62ff\u547d\u5806\u8fc7\u7684\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8868\u56db\u5173\u53cd\u5411\u7684\u91cc\u56db\u5173\u6ca1\u6709checkpoint\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u547d\u901a\u5173\uff08...\uff09\u6240\u4ee5\u60f3\u62ff\u9f50\u6210\u5c31\u7684\u8bdd\u8fd8\u662f\u522b\u4e70\u4e8623333\n\u6709\u6548\u6cbb\u624b\u6b8b\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2aBOSS\u86ee\u597d\u73a9\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u5b9a\u53cd\u5e94\u529b\u3002\n\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e9b\u5730\u65b9\u7684\u914d\u8272\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u778e\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u7b2c\u56db\u4e2aBOSS\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u9762......\n", "timestamp_created": 1500297228, "timestamp_updated": 1500297228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33605045": {"recommendationid": "33605045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089545067", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499239018}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u8003\u9a8c\u8282\u594f\u611f\uff0c\u624b\u6b8b\u614e\u5165", "timestamp_created": 1500287628, "timestamp_updated": 1500287628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33588525": {"recommendationid": "33588525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007386929", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500222093}, "language": "english", "review": "Is not good game.", "timestamp_created": 1500222144, "timestamp_updated": 1500222144, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.278583", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33577250": {"recommendationid": "33577250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035086640", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500181835}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely without a doubt, amazing soundtrack.\n\nOn the front of gameplay, its rather difficult with sound, as the enviroment works around the sound but you yourself do not.. so you get sucked into the beat of the songs and start ignoring the whole concept of platforming.

Then the area around you changes, new patterns or mechanics are introduced, and you go for the next circle delivery. After doing that a few times, there is a boss battle to end the level. \n\nThe twist is that things move every few moments to the beat of the music. For example, a square of static might appear/disappear every other beat. Or a platform might move left/right at the pace of the song. It's all about learning the pattern and then executing the solution.\n\nIn the first four levels, autosaves are pretty common and boss sequences aren't incredibly long so it is less frustrating than it could have been. You learn a short pattern and then keep trying until you get it right and then move on to the next part.\n\nAnd then you get to the second four levels. Based on the first one in that set (the fifth overall), it seems to be a mirror reflection of the first set. However, there are no autosaves; if you die once it kicks you back to the level select area. So yeah, I quit there because that isn't my type of fun.\n\nPersonally, the most memorable part of the game for me were the boss fights but there's no easy way to replay them and I'm not going to play through 10 or so minutes of regular level to try them again. \n\nIt's worth a look on sale if you're looking for simple platformer to do one evening. And if you're a hardcore gamer who enjoys pain (I'm kidding) you can try the four mirror levels and try to speedrun it.\n\nOther thoughts:\n[list]\n[*] I wish it had an options screen to adjust volume and to make the background static/non-moving or turn off the background graphics (it was okay for the first few minutes but was distracting/unpleasant for me). It's more 'artistic' this way but I don't really care about that when it gets in the way of my enjoyment of a game.\n[*] When I say the game is short, I mean it took me about an hour or so to get through the first four levels. I'm pretty sure that it doesn't save your progress mid-level if you quit so you have to dedicate a pretty good chunk of time for each level. Not quite MOBA-length but not fast/casual Hearthstone-length either.\n[*] Boss battles are a step up in difficulty from the actual level and don't use the same skillset (realtime, some bosses are bullet hells so no 'take your time to learn the pattern and execute'). So it's possible you could get stuck and never see the rest of the game.\n[*] It's annoying that you are caught by static 'early' when you're running as a circle (you're not touching the static as a circle but if you were standing still as a square you would be). It means you have to jump earlier than your eyes tell you to. On the bright side, it also means you land jumps that it seems you shouldn't have reached as a circle.\n[*] Many times you have some leniency in timing but there are some instances where that are strict and you have to time your jumps to go at the edge of the platform or to land just as the static disappears.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1500171618, "timestamp_updated": 1500173147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33553937": {"recommendationid": "33553937", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970719375", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500218982}, "language": "german", "review": "140 - der Name sagt alles aus, was man \u00fcber dieses Spiel wissen muss. \n140 ist der konstante Beat der (f\u00fcr mich) sehr feinen elektronischen Musik. \n140 ist der Takt, auf den s\u00e4mtliche Hindernisse und Bossk\u00e4mpfe ausgerichtet sind. \n140 schl\u00e4gt der Puls, w\u00e4hrend man die schwierigeren Parts meistert. \nAllerdings ist das Spiel, ohne die 'Hard Mode' Mirror-Levels, auch in unter 140 Minuten vorbei. \n\nIch werte dieses Spiel als gelungenes Plattformer-Experiment.

But the worst thing about it is the boss battles which are challenging but not in a good way. Frankly the boss fights have ruined the game for me and it's mainly from not having control over when you attack because the attack happens automatically every few seconds in time with 140bpm.

Rhythmic awareness is required to overcome obstacles controlled by an energetic, yet melancholic electronic soundtrack.[/quote]\n\nWell that was an experience to say the least.\n\nHonestly, if I were to sum up this game in ten words or less, it would be: \"The best and hardest minimalist game I have ever played.\" Because, my GOD this game is amazing. But my GOD this game is abnormally difficult as well. That's not to say the difficulty curve is bad, but that is to say that this game is very high in difficulty at some points and very low in difficulty in others. And, surprisingly, the bossfights were actually REWARDING when I finished them, because it took a while to finally finish just [i]ONE[/i] of the four bossfights.\n\nThe level design is minimalistic, and that's a good thing. I think that if the levels were more detailed, it would ruin the fun that this game gives to us. I love how smooth the transitions are, and how this game doesn't lag up the computer that I use for playing games. And the computer that I use is most [i]definitely[/i] not what people consider a \"Gaming PC\" to say the least.\n\nThe fact that this game is low-spec and fun to play repeatedly is what makes this game a masterpiece of work. There's no doubt about it, Carlsen Games, you have done good with this game. And I think that if you want to keep this game like it is, here's a suggestion: HAVE. EXTRA. LEVEL. PACK. DLC. Seriously, though, DLC with extra level packs would not only keep the original game short for the people who don't want the DLC, but also keep the game going for as long as Steam exists.\n\nIn the 1.2 hours that I have played on record (at the time of writing this review), that's all that I need from the game. I can keep playing it, sure, but having a game this short is what people should need from games with this style. Take Super Hexagon, for example. It's similar in style, being a minimalist music-based game, but also doesn't take more than 2 hours with practice. That's what this game is. It takes less than two hours, even without practice, and is still very, VERY fun.\n\nSo if you do make a fifth level, just remember what I said: DLC can- oh, wait, let me quote that:\n\n[quote=Cubey]DLC can take you a long way![/quote]\n\nThank you for making this game, and I hope that you continue to have success with this game in the future.\n\n~Cubelovd59 // Cubey~\n\n[i]P.S. Thanks for making the game $1.69 for the Steam Summer Sale![/i]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note, Carlsen Games: I wound up putting this game on my YouTube channel. The link to the video is right here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKcVf9sUXNc\n(Seem familiar?)\nAnyways, I just wanted to say that I am doing this with no profit. I never intend my videos to have any profit, just want to make them for fun. I got really nervous when I saw that you were claiming the music, but then saw that it was all okay.

Controls are extremely simple: all you can do is jump and move left and right. However, platforms and hazards will move in a predictable, rhythmic way, requiring you to move with the rhythm to get through. Mechanics are introduced intuitively, with orbs filled with colors moving around in ways that hint at the mechanic they introduce when brought to the hole they must be placed in. As more mechanics are introduced in a stage, the world gets more complex, but never chaotic. Bosses are also connected to the rhythm, and neatly finish off their stages. Checkpoints are placed far enough apart to make getting through stages with sheer luck rare, but common enough to prevent the stages from being too hard. All four stages are well-made, and each has a unique feel. The second half of the game also offers a nice challenge, removing all checkpoints to require complete mastery of each stage.

The game does depend a little bit on your ability to appreciate or at least tolerate the musical style, since I imagine its a quite different experience if you have to mute it.\n\nReally one of the best and games I have played in a long time.

There are lots of indie platformers w/ minimal abstract graphics coupled w/ electronic music these. This is one of them and it's good.\n\n2. This is a single serving game, at least the main three levels of it. I have been enjoying this type of thing more and more. You don't have to fret over weather or not to finish a game once you deem it mediocre halfway through. Sit down w/ a tall drink of your choosing and you'll probably beat this before you have to go to the bathroom. \n\n3. [i]140[/i]'s gimmick is tight incorporation of its music into gameplay. Jumps and other actions must be timed w/ the beat of the music and reaching checkpoints in stages adds layers to its adaptive soundtrack. It's a pretty cool affect.\n\n4. The music is not just well incorporated, it is essential. Every time I tried to trial-and-error my way through tough situations, I found it just didn't work. You need the beat. Still, this is a platformer first and a rhythm game second. I feel this detail makes it stand out from many other similar games.\n\n5. Unfortunately, what drives point 4 home is a few sections of the game where the beat is not particularly strong and gameplay suffers a bit as a result. *shrugs*\n\n6. Yes, of course the music is good! The interactive nature of it means you can't download a soundtrack or anything which is a major bummer if you ask me.\n\n7. Overall, this is not too tough. There are some tricky bits but checkpoints are abound so no big deal if you die or whatever it is that happens when a white square touches a field of static happens to you. \n\n8. This only applies to playing through the three levels normally. There is also a mode where you play through a mirrored version of the original levels w/ no checkpoints at all even before the boss battles. This give you some old school NES-style toughness if you want it. \n\n9. Re-playing through a second time makes you realize just how much getting through each section is dependent on knowing the correct rhythm. Parts that seemed really hard at first are really easy once you've got your head wrapped around how to do them.\n\n10. The default controller setup maps movement to the left analog stick on an Xbox controller and the d-pad does nothing. For the most part, this is comfortable but there were a few sections that I found myself wishing for more accurate controls and this might have been the reason. I was too lazy to see if remapping controls helped. I got things to do, people. \n\n11. [i]140[/i] autosaves your progress but only after completing an entire level. Also, holding down the start button is what makes you exit the game so you might accidentally quit when you are trying to pause. Guess who found this out the hard way?\n\n12. One thing I'm glad to this is actual boss battles. Lots of these minimal graphics sort of games seem to leave this aspect of classic platforming out. It's not my favorite part of the game but I'm glad to see it at all. \n\n13. End of the day, I think Carlsen Games did what they set out to do w/ [i]140[/i]. They took a concept, implemented it w/ only very minor problems and didn't feel the need to drive it into the ground w/ a hundred levels. Sure, this game doesn't take long to finish but it doesn't need to take long. It doesn't feel incomplete or unfinished but like it's meant to get its point across quickly.

When you finally get through a difficult section it it is very rewarding though. \n\nIt's very easy to lose yourself in this game despite it's absolute minimalism, but I did find myself tireing of the game fast once I got to the first boss simply because it's bullet-hell. It's done well, I'm sure, but I just can't enjoy that part nearly as much as the rest of the game. \n\nIf you'd think a difficult but well done and rewarding rhythm platformer with some bullet-hell mixed into it would be up your alley, then don't hesitate, it'll no doubt fill that need with it's excellent game design.", "timestamp_created": 1484419428, "timestamp_updated": 1484419428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29201529": {"recommendationid": "29201529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258734069", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504463828}, "language": "french", "review": "Magique.\nMinimaliste au possible.

I have no idea why they named it \"140\". It seems to be just a random number, because they couldn't find anything to discribe their game with. And that's the point. There is no existing word they could've described \"140\" with. Neither I can. But no matter what \"140\" means, important is what it means [i]to me[/i]. And that's where things get interesting. \n\n\"140\" could be \"[b]a[/b] rhythm based platformer\", if it was [b]a[/b] rhythm based platformer\". But that's not the case. \"140\" is [b]the[/b] rhythm based platformer. Basically, 140 [i]redefined[/i] the meaning of \"rhythm platformer\". I know that's hard to understand, but putting an indirect pronoun before the description of this game wouldn't be just fair. The game's mechanic isn't any unique, but that doesn't mean the game in it's entirety isn't. \"140\" isn't the only minimalistic platformer, it wasn't the first rythm platformer, neither \"140\" features anything never seen before. Instead the strenghth of \"140\" is combining all those in the best way possible. \"140\" doesn't do much, but the few things it does are done with perfection. That's what I found impressive. \"140\" isn't \"[b]a[/b] number\" anymore, \"140\" is [i]the expression[/i] for an entire new sort of game, only \"140\" can define. \n\nAs I said, \"140\" can hardly be described. You have to try it on your own and by saying \"you have to\" I mean it. There'd be no excuse for you not to think similiar about \"140\". I won't force you to like it, but you need to agree:\n\n\"140\" is for \"unique\". And \"unique\" is for \"phantastic in it's own way.\" And \"phantastic in it's own way\" is for \"must have played-tiltle.\"\n\nI know this one is a weird of a review.

The three levels all have different mechanics to their platforming. For instance, in the second level, there are these \"pairs\" of platforms that toggle between each other whenever the one active is touched. These new mechanics are the best of the \"teaching by showing\", or in this case, \"teaching by doing\". It's always fun when you figure out when something new is there, and you finally figure out how it works. The music, although not the best, fits the minimalist art style, and is great when platforming. In the third level, there's a bum bum in the music. When this happens, two blocks move.

There are bosses at the end of the three levels, which I think is a nice touch as it adds some variety to the gameplay than just a normal platformer.

But first, to be fair, I will outline 140's principal strengths. \n\n140 is a minimalistic platform game where you move your little shape across classic platform challenges. For what resources it has available to it, 140 is remarkably well-designed. You are a square and take the form of a circle while moving and a triangle while jumping. A good deal of the challenges are timed and give you audio cues via the retro, electronic-like soundtrack. The game does a good job of showing without telling, where every challenge's solution is made apparent to you with enough of your own analysis. To this end, I believe 140 is a great game for instruction on game design; every aspect is intuitive and rewards the player without fanfare. However, this point introduces 140's central flaw: as a game.\n\n140 is so insubstantial that it harkens more of a tech demo or as I said above, merely a tool for instruction. The minimalistic style is not the crux of this problem either. While such a game made in the early 2000s would have likely been a free Flash game, I could have excused that if the release had a decent level of content, but alas, 140 really only has three levels. Solid levels mind you, but from my perspective, charging $5 for three levels strikes me as a poor investment. The game indulges in fake longevity by giving you three more levels at the end of the game, but they are just mirrors of the first three levels, but without checkpoints.

Each chapter is divided into \"scenes\" that you unlock as you progress, with each scene adding more to the upbeat soundtrack, switching up the colors and introducing a new platforming mechanic. \n\n- Graphics: It's minimalistic (in a geometrical way) but extremely vibrant. Very cheerful! (which is a good thing, too, considering how frustrating hard mode can get)\n\n- Mechanics: there are two actions, moving and jumping, and all platforming mechanics revolve around that basic premise. There are the usual death pits and disappearing platforms, as well as trampolines, gravity shifts, and moving \"death squares\". In essence, there are a lot of obstacles. The game is not called a challenging platformer for nothing.\n\n- Music: The upbeat soundtrack fits the visual aesthetics beautifully. It changes as you go along (so do the graphics), becoming more impressive as you progress through a level. To me it was the most impressive aspect of the game. If you're having trouble timing your jumps or avoiding obstacles, pay attention to the tempo! The obstacles and platforms move in time with the music.\n\n- Difficulty: In normal mode (which you have to complete before you can unlock the higher difficulty), each key in the level doubles as a save state, but when you quit the game, you have to start the level from the beginning. The save states are only remembered during a session. \nI personally like challenging platformers (think: Give Up, the Impossible Game  and Meat Boy), so I knew what I was getting myself into. In less than 3 hours I finished the normal mode twice (had to -- I uninstalled the game once I completed it, then I learned about the higher difficulty, and when I re-installed it I had to start all over to unlock hard mode). So it's a relatively small game. \nThe boss fights will start out as a hit-or-miss experience, and will take you by surprise by a sudden change in mechanics. If you've played through them once, however, they become much easier afterwards (I'd go so far as to say that they're easier than the regular levels). \n\nThe hard mode is permadeath -- one mistake, and you're at the beginning of the chapter. It's more frustrating and time-consuming than challenging. Other than that, it's basically a palette swap and a horizontal swap of the original normal mode levels. \n\n- Genre: There is no story or even any text in the game (except for the credits); in addition to being a minimalistic, challenging platformer, it's a visual aesthetic experience without any particular settings or themes. \n\n- Technical notes: I haven't encountered any bugs, and honestly, I doubt that it's possible to even find any. It runs smoothly, which is good news for a platformer, and its requirements are so low that you could probably play it on your toaster.", "timestamp_created": 1479980750, "timestamp_updated": 1479980750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27000404": {"recommendationid": "27000404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024052051", "num_games_owned": 482, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 755, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512442587}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun action platformer for when you want to kill a half hour or so.", "timestamp_created": 1479956618, "timestamp_updated": 1479956618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26994471": {"recommendationid": "26994471", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960752770", "num_games_owned": 780, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1411503970}, "language": "english", "review": "(tl;dr below)\n\nI haven't played this game for some time, but the (at the time of writing) current Steam Awards compelled me to finally express my total appreciation for this beautiful, pure title. I won't be going deep into mechanics, since they're very simple and other reviews have no doubt gone into that in proper detail, and will rather focus on trying to put the experience of playing this game into words.\n\nThis, along with only Fez maybe, was the first game that came to mind when it came to voting for the \u201cI Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award\u201d award, since I have heard little to no hype behind it and yet it's in my top 5 PC VG experiences. I've tried to turn other people onto this game, but due to the aesthetics (or lack thereof, arguably?) haven't caught on. \n\nThat's such an awful shame, because this game is the \"purest\" game I've ever played. There are no characters, no words, no powerups (except contextual).. there are only the very essentials needed for a platformer to be successful as a game. These essentials, however; the simple platforming, wonderful music, dynamic level design, are so expertly melded together that I can only compare the experience of playing this game to having the perfect dancing partner to the perfect music at the perfect place. It really is like the outside world fades away, and only you, your partner, the music and the very ground you're stepping on remains, and as time goes on, [b]you become one. [/b] \n\nThis might seem hyperbolic to some people, and certainly I don't expect anyone else to feel the same, but that was the genuine effect this simple little game had on me back when I played it. Visceral, almost animalistic purity. \n\nSorry for this rambling, imperfect review, but it's time it at least got its proper due from me. Finishing the last boss* somehow gave me the same cathartic warmth that finally finishing Dostoyevsky's literary masterpiece Crime and Punishment gave me.

The game will captivate you with it's charm, all the while making sure it's got you tightly enough that dying at particularly hard chokepoints don't scare you off.\n\nIt has a good learning curve, though seems to stop short of it's full potential. The 3 levels of the game are well designed, but can be quick to punish you if you are impatient. Of course, the checkpoints make sure you have a chance to attempt the hard parts very quickly again.\n\nThe mirror levels are the frustration point for the completionists, and where I feel the real challenge lies. You do the same 3 levels as before, but the opposite way and no checkpoints - if you die you go back to the level select.

It's pretty addicting until you've beaten it, but thankfully the game is pretty short.

The colors and art direction is phenonemal, really gets you into the game.  Where 140 shines, though, is the impressively good soundtrack.  The music is some top-notch EDM/Electronica stuff that really brings the game together.  The art and sound work in unison to create the games experience (art style/colors change to the beat of the music, as music changes based on your \"modes\" and such.\n\nFor a platformer though, there is one game mechanic that really must be paid attention to, and that's the controls.  The controls on this game, despite being a pretty basic shape-based, music-infused, artistic indie platformer, are very tight and allow for all the needed effects whilst playing.\n\nReally a pleasure

O problema \u00e9 que o jogo se baseia S\u00d3 nisso, e a rela\u00e7\u00e3o ritmo/plataforma nem sempre funciona. Entendo porque muita gente gostou do jogo, tamb\u00e9m o achei bem cativante no come\u00e7o, mas pra mim a dificuldade nunca deve ser a principal caracter\u00edstica de um jogo. Fora isso o jogo s\u00f3 tem 3 levels (que n\u00e3o terminei) e pelo que vi, podem ser terminados em 1 hora e meia, os \u00faltimos tr\u00eas levels s\u00e3o as mesmas anteriores s\u00f3 que sem checkpoints.

The problem is that the game is based ONLY on this, and the rhythm / platform relation does not always work.

You have to coordinate your movements with said beat and you're good. The only problem here is that the beats constantly change so you'll have to adapt really fast to the situations. It may get faster , slower or it may even be changed entierly. \n\nThe game features three levels and three bosses. Each level is unique in it's own way , from the ever changing color pallet to the style of beat which you'll have to adapt to. Each level holds a special item which will help you progress to the next level if you bring it to the hub world. \n\nNow I mentioned something about there being three bosses. This seemed really awesome at first because I did not expect such a game to even have bosses and they were...interesting? I guess. The thing is each boss is a variation of gameplay you've never seen before which may seem a little out of place in the overall experience but I gotta admit that I enjoyed every single boss the game had to offer. \n\n140 is a fun little experience you can finish in about 2-3 hours.

Taking that and the fact that it's short (it only took me an hour to finish the game, tho I don't even dare attempt the extra mirror levels because like hell im going through that shit with just one life now) in consideration, I'd say its best to wait for it when its on sale to get it.", "timestamp_created": 1452197961, "timestamp_updated": 1452197961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507205", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20378045": {"recommendationid": "20378045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008208203", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1386227403}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun rhythm-based platformer.

I just played this game from start to end this evening, and I'm totally blown away. The amazing soundtrack is still playing in my head, which is also a quite important element of the game. The soundtrack I mean, not my head. The graphics are very enjoyable as well. They fit perfectlly with the music, and they're both super tight, crispy and geometric. And the colours are  beautiful. I would say that this has been one of the greatest game experiences I've had. Another great thing about 140 is the difficulty. It's not easy. The last battle in 140 (no spoilers) was one of the hardest moments I've had in gaming. It's difficult in another way than most puzzle platformers, because you have to really be in sync with the rhythm and in the end you have to kind of split your brain in two in order to win. At least that's what I experienced. That made it very satisfying to finally beat it in the end, after I'd done it over and over and over and ended up in a more or less meditative state of mind.\n\nSkip this paragraph, if you haven't played the game and don't want a spoiler. I haven't beaten the mirror part of the game yet. That's the one with no checkpoints. And I don't think that I'll be able to, at least not the third (or sixth) level, it's simply too hard. I've beaten games like Megaman, VVVVVV and Metroid 2, but at least they have save systems all the way through. Hopefully I wont miss too much by not beating the mirror part, it seems to be the same as the normal part, but there might be surprises. Hopefully I'll find out one day.\n\nThe next thing I do after writing this review is finding that soundtrack. I've heard that it's made by Bj\u00f8rn Svin, who's a really cool Danish electronic musician, but it's hard to find any info on it. The game is Danish, I'm sure of that. It's made by some of the guys from Playdead behind Limbo (which is also a seriously amazing game). And one last thing: Remember to play this game with the best speakers or headphones you got in your house, it deserves it.\n\nEdit:\nThe soundtrack is not by Bj\u00f8rn Svin, as I've been told. It's made by Jakob Schmid, who's also from Playdead. Here's his soundcloud:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/schmid\n\nI found this nice little article about the game that tells about the people behind it. One of the graphic designers apparently made a music video for Bj\u00f8rn Svin, so maybe that's the source to the misunderstanding. Here it is:\nhttp://aiaiai.dk/blog/140-the-rhythm-based-minimalist-platform-game\n\nAnd here's a thread in which he's promised to write, when ever he is done with fine tuning the soundtrack (on the last page there's also a link to an unofficial soundtrack made by one of the commenters):\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/242820/discussions/0/792924412012466475/", "timestamp_created": 1452108495, "timestamp_updated": 1453499401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502877", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20352525": {"recommendationid": "20352525", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141096117", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433693349}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a very difficult game.\n\n9/10 Would rage again.", "timestamp_created": 1452093665, "timestamp_updated": 1452093665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "12", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20342112": {"recommendationid": "20342112", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998647125", "num_games_owned": 564, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452194056}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and interesting rhythm based platformer.\n\nPros:\nSolid gameplay.\nCool, building music.\nInteresting layering of music and environment effects.\n\nCons:\nBonus mirror stages have no checkpoints, creating big time/skill necessity for completionists.\nShort gameplay.\n\nRecommend getting for less than full price, 5$ is a bit much for 1-2 hours of enjoyable gameplay and 2-8 hours of frustration.", "timestamp_created": 1452056060, "timestamp_updated": 1452056060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.972603", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20331155": {"recommendationid": "20331155", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972731852", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452021706}, "language": "english", "review": "Elegant little platformer.

I despise them because of this fact. But I'm a musician and 140 is brilliant. It is extremely difficult and sometimes frustrating, because everything has to be pixel and microsecond perfect. Like I said, I don't generally enjoy this, but when it works, it feels like you're just flowing with the music, and that's a great feeling. The one complaint that I have is that you have to beat the levels in a stretch. There are checkpoints within the levels, but if you quit without beating the level, you have to start over. This is particularly frustrating in the \"boss battles\" of the levels, which are somewhat stressful. You can't really take a break, even though sometimes that's what you need. Still, I recommend the game to anyone who does love platformers, and even if you don't (like me), it still might be worth your time.", "timestamp_created": 1451197953, "timestamp_updated": 1451197953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19955089": {"recommendationid": "19955089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078103257", "num_games_owned": 531, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431715277}, "language": "french", "review": "Un petit jeu ind\u00e9 d'1 heure environ .\nIl allie musique et gameplay .\nA jouer avec un casque c'est un plaisir pourles yeux et les oreilles .\nIl n'est pas dure, c'est une experience plus qu'un jeu .", "timestamp_created": 1451119266, "timestamp_updated": 1451119266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19943729": {"recommendationid": "19943729", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993569487", "num_games_owned": 1326, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452373035}, "language": "french", "review": "Un bon \"petit jeu\"de plate-forme minimaliste, tr\u00e8s court (moins d'une heure pour le terminer) mais tr\u00e8s intense.\nExcellente musique.", "timestamp_created": 1451085105, "timestamp_updated": 1451085105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19937380": {"recommendationid": "19937380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088064754", "num_games_owned": 545, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451055405}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud558\ub098\uc758 \ubba4\uc9c1\ube44\ub514\uc624\ub97c \uccb4\ud5d8\ud558\ub294 \ub4ef\ud55c \uae30\ubd84\uc774 \ub4e4\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uc74c\uc545\uc744 \uc9c1\uc811 \ub290\ub084 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc990\uac70\uc6b4 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc744 \uc120\uc0ac \ud574\uc900\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1451056227, "timestamp_updated": 1451056227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19914993": {"recommendationid": "19914993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079731784", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479736293}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Pros:\n- The sound of the game is fantastic\n- The colors and the effects are simple, but awesome at the same time\n- Boss fight is awesome\n\nCons:\n- Too short\n- Stages become repetitive\n", "timestamp_created": 1450981061, "timestamp_updated": 1450981061, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19914620": {"recommendationid": "19914620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015574971", "num_games_owned": 475, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450980029}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a great simple game.

Usually, the normal part can be blasted through in no more than 2 hours, and then you'll be presented with the ending sequence. If you're not paying attention to the game's \"menu\" afterward - or if you're not interested in the mirror stages challenge at all - you're seriously missing out. The 1-life nature of the challenge will force you to sync your mind with the rhythms, and that's when the true nature of this game really shines.\n\n[h1]Commentary[/h1]\n\nThere exists typically two types of platformers: one that tests your intelligence and one that tests your reflexes. [i]140[/i] belongs to the latter type which I loathe and usually refrain from buying at all, but the inclusion of strongly rhythmic elements has made this game far more approachable than other sadistic titles in the genre. Most of the obstacles in particular act in tight concert with background music loops and aren't influenced by user behaviors, eliminating a lot of luck factor commonly observed in other reflex-based platformers. For the 3 mirror stages I was able to master each one within a 1 ~ 1.5 hour timeframe, making steady and perceivable progress in memorizing the level each time, thanks to the aid of the strong beats.\n\nAt the end of each stage there's also a \"boss fight\", featuring obstacles that react to user behaviors. This introduces certain degree of randomness into the play - while all the bosses still act with patterns, the boss fights can become a major source of frustrations in the mirror stages due to their reflex-centric nature. The only mirror stage boss I was able to get in one go was the final (3rd) one - the only boss that isn't actually influenced by user behaviors and thus the easiest to beat providing that you've done your homework (though the fight still remains highly intense). I found it immensely helpful to spell out the next pattern loudly and assertively as if I'm countermoving the final boss with my incantation, and experienced tremendous relief and satisfaction as my final word sealed the fate of the boss with all the well-timed rhythms and musics. Priceless moment.\n\nAll in all, this game is very challenging but was nicely designed in a way to prevent it from becoming a torture. It certainly ain't gonna end up in my list of top games, but it's a quality one nonetheless.", "timestamp_created": 1450017134, "timestamp_updated": 1475479216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.660230", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19655339": {"recommendationid": "19655339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192858525", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445541086}, "language": "english", "review": "If Steam had a \"meh~\" button I would have gone with it, but since it doesn't I had to choose to not recommend this game.\n\nIt's not bad per se, just not my cup of tea I guess.

The music is upbeat and works well with the rythm aspect of the gameplay, which consists mostly of timing your jumps and some puzzle solving in order to progress through the level. As each level progresses the music gets more complicated with different sounds that in turn correspond to platforms and hazards in the level, so that you can use the music and sounds to time jumps and plan movements. The controls are great and work perfectly with a keyboard, which is what I used to play. \n\n[u]The Bad:[/u]\nThe biggest downside is that this game is extremely short, I managed to complete the three levels in the game in under an hour. This game is $5 and the amount of content provided is not enough to constitute the asking price.

In horror games you can rarely be sure if what you hear is harmless ambience or the playable character's sanity (or your own) going nuts. In action games, the battle music vary from epic choirs to hard rock, but the goal is to make the player FEEL the battle - with intense and up-lifting sounds, as if something large is behind the sounds.\n\nRarely music is made for other reasons than that. 140 seeks to experiment other variations, and that it has definitely done well.\n\n140 is a rhythmic platformer game where the music guides you. It tells you how the environment warps, either for your favor or to kill you. Every time you catch one of those fleeing, round music machines and drag them to a check point, the world changes. The color theme changes, and the music gets a new addition while enhancing the already existing soundtrack. An another part of the level has now been unlocked, either by formerly static objects starting to move or you suddenly going all anti-gravity. Whatever happens, the new instrument in the concert that is 140's changing soundtrack tells you how do they work. Just don't forget that the music doesn't tell you when to jump!\n\n140 was mainly developed by a person also involved in LIMBO. While playing the game, I could really feel the fact when failing the outwardly simple yet mind-bending timing requiring platforming.\n\nThe game includes three stages with one boss for each. The boss fights are the moments where you REALLY get tested! And if after clearing the game once you still seek a challenge, you might want to try the mirror worlds, where you get only one attempt to clearing each level.\n\nIn other words and in short, despite the game being short and looking simple both graphically and gameplay-wise, it still manages to bring in fresh experiences with well thought-out design. It's a kind of a game that you have to play to understand its worth.\n\nHowever, as much as I want to blurt out fancy phrases to describe 140's greatness, it's still a short game. One can easily finish this game in one to two hours. But is that such a bad thing? I got the feeling that this game was experimental, and a well thought-out one, if I may be so shameful as to re-use my early wording. The price is also a good measurement of the game's length: the full price is a meekly $5, and every now and then I spot that it's on sale with 80 % off the price.\n\nIn short:\n- Simple yet challenging, but still doesn't make it seem like it's impossible\n- Fun boss fights that differ from usual platforming, even within this game itself\n- Graphically fluid and simple\n- The music, along with being used in a new way, is also pretty good 'n catchy!\n\nIf you thought platformers can not have anything new to offer, that everything has already been done, this game proves that there is still a lot to be done to reach that point.", "timestamp_created": 1445201246, "timestamp_updated": 1445201246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569723", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18556680": {"recommendationid": "18556680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010560368", "num_games_owned": 841, "num_reviews": 331, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499180347}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440 140:\n+\u041a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440,  \u0441\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0438 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u0438 \u0443\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c.\n+\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438 \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b.\n\n--\u041e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441: \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u041e\u0427\u0415\u041d\u042c \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u044f, \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0437 4 \u044d\u0442\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0432, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u0447\u0430\u0441, \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043c 2\n\n\u0414\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0432\u043e\u0434\u044b \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0438: \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043a, \u0441\u043c\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435.\n\nP.S. \u0414\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0435\u0449\u0435 4 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430, \u0430\u0431\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0435\u0445 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u043d\u043e \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0447\u0435\u043a\u043f\u043e\u0438\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432.", "timestamp_created": 1445199787, "timestamp_updated": 1499009094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520430", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18554809": {"recommendationid": "18554809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183807691", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1516204251}, "language": "english", "review": "Difficult, frustrating and truly rhytmical.

The music provides a nice beat for the game to go by, but it's repetitive and not very memorable. The controls work fine and the levels are competently built, but the game is very short, there's not a whole lot of challenge, and no part of this game stands out as being better than \"competent\" or \"decent\".\n\nThere's not much in this game that's done poorly, but there's also not much that's better than average here.

N\u00e3o tem hist\u00f3ria, voc\u00ea \u00e9 basicamente um quadrado que vira c\u00edrculo quando se move e tri\u00e2ngulo quando pula, num ambiente bem minimalista que reage de acordo com a m\u00fasica de fundo.

Todo e qualquer movimento no jogo toca um som, nos mesmos 140 BPM, e conforme voc\u00ea prossegue nas fases a jun\u00e7\u00e3o dos sons vai ficando mais elaborada e complexa, at\u00e9 o momento em que voc\u00ea diz \"corolho mas isso parece uma m\u00fasica completa!\".

D\u00e1 pra dizer que esse jogo \u00e9 praticamente o exato oposto do LIMBO: enquanto no LIMBO o ambiente \u00e9 todo sombrio e introvertido, fazendo voc\u00ea descobrir como passar de certo modo, o 140 faz voc\u00ea experimentar e muito o ambiente enquanto explora o ritmo e o cen\u00e1rio extrovertido.\n\nA jogabilidade \u00e9 extremamente simples e incrivelmente fluida, \u00e9 pura plataforma r\u00edtmica. Quanto mais atento voc\u00ea ficar e mais ritmo voc\u00ea tiver, mais f\u00e1cil fica, pois algumas partes exigem que voc\u00ea calcule precisamente o ritmo da m\u00fasica pra prosseguir. Muitas vezes voc\u00ea s\u00f3 acaba \"indo com o flow\". Os bosses tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o escapam disso, e na minha opini\u00e3o eles foram feitos de uma maneira muito criativa nesse contexto. N\u00e3o quero soltar spoilers aqui pra voc\u00eas, s\u00f3 jogando pra sentir.\n\nInfelizmente esse jogo n\u00e3o chega a ser perfeito (nenhum jogo \u00e9, certo?), pois eu achei ele meio curto (sim, outra vez), s\u00e3o basicamente 3 fases onde voc\u00ea pode praticamente zerar o jogo em 1 hora por a\u00ed. Por\u00e9m, pra compensar isso, depois que voc\u00ea zera o jogo, \u00e9 aberta uma \u00e1rea nova com as mesmas 3 fases, por\u00e9m espelhadas e com um fator mais hardcore: n\u00e3o h\u00e1 checkpoints. Ou seja, morreu, vai fazer tudo do come\u00e7o de novo. Isso compensou de certa forma o fato do jogo ser curto.\n\nQuanto ao fator replay, a\u00ed vai de cada um. Alguns podem conseguir 100% dos achievements e depois nunca mais jogar. Eu, por exemplo, volto sempre quando bate aquela vontade de jogar de novo s\u00f3 pra ouvir as m\u00fasicas. S\u00e9rio, eu nunca vi um jogo t\u00e3o bem-feito como esse.\n\nO jogo \u00e9 relativamente barato, uns R$ 10, apesar de eu ter pego ele na sale. Recomendo fortemente esse jogo a qualquer um que curte plataforma e m\u00fasicas experimentais. 140 \u00e9 um jogo \u00fanico por si s\u00f3.\n\n\n-PR\u00d3S\n+Minimalismo puro e experi\u00eancia \u00fanica de jogo\n+Jogabilidade extremamente fluida\n+M\u00fasicas feitas de um jeito inovador e criativo\n+Relativamente barato e divertido\n\n-MAIS OU MENOS\n~Sinto que podia ter uma sequ\u00eancia ou algo que desse pra criar novas fases\n\n-CONTRAS\n-Jogo curto, por\u00e9m o fator replay pode (ou n\u00e3o) se sobrepor a isso\n\nNOTA FINAL: 9.75/10", "timestamp_created": 1441572844, "timestamp_updated": 1479938639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17909796": {"recommendationid": "17909796", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992712448", "num_games_owned": 466, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441536875}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, great beats, 3D audio sometimes.

Each of the three levels in 140 has a unique song which evolves as the player makes progress. This musical evolution is important as the level itself will also shift and become more alive as new beats are added; platforms will activate, blocks will shift, and deadly static will move, all to the beat of the music. For such a short game, 140 packs a massive amount of creativity and style into each of its stages and a large amount of the enjoyment to be had from 140 comes from figuring out which rules each object follows and keeping track of which parts of the environment synchronize with which parts of the song. \n\nWhile by no means the hardest platformer out there, 140 nevertheless often asks quite a bit of the player, so I am rather happy to be able to say that the controls are not only simple and intuitive, but very precise. Visually, 140 is a game composed of simple geometrical shapes and its various color schemes can at times be outright ugly, but the graphics never feel lazy nor mundane. This is a game for which a specific aesthetic was chosen and repeatedly pushed to its limits in various ways without being outright broken and, at the end of the day, the simple shapes and often-ugly color schemes compliment each other and work surprisingly well.\n\nAlthough I have mentioned it in passing previously, the biggest downside to 140 really is its length. Players can beat the game in under an hour and, after that, there's just not much reason to go back. Yes, there are mirror mode stages with no checkpoints which unlock after beating the game, but reversed versions of the original stages with new color schemes are not particularly interesting and the lack of checkpointing (which is quite well-placed in the normal stages) feels like a lazy way to inflate difficulty and mostly just results in frustration and boredom. 140 is definitely a game which values quality over quantity and, while it has quality in spades, it's a bit tough to recommend a game which is quite this short for its normal asking price of $5.\n\nBrevity aside, 140 is ultimately a wonderful and wonderfully creative game which fully embraces the beauty of simplicity in every way it can.", "timestamp_created": 1440821482, "timestamp_updated": 1440821511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502626", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17761134": {"recommendationid": "17761134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025187456", "num_games_owned": 904, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497904002}, "language": "french", "review": "Frais comme une sucrerie acidull\u00e9e , niveau sonore  \u00e7a tape  dans l os.......\n140 est un beat game rac\u00e9.", "timestamp_created": 1440798201, "timestamp_updated": 1440798201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17741341": {"recommendationid": "17741341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047074860", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440697414}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd8\u7b97\u662f\u633a\u597d\u73a9\u7684\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1440697520, "timestamp_updated": 1440697520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17727672": {"recommendationid": "17727672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043490532", "num_games_owned": 480, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440616508}, "language": "russian", "review": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA RAGE!!!!

The music is really good for a platformer, it's like dance music with slow parts in it. \n\nOverall the game is pretty good for a platformer, but it's kind of difficult if you can't move to a beat (which pretty much everyone can.)", "timestamp_created": 1437644666, "timestamp_updated": 1437644666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17176848": {"recommendationid": "17176848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112323597", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437591136}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is pretty fun, fairly challenging and very visually interesting.

Using some very simple mechanics, even simpler visuals, and marrying them with excellent sound and rythm gives you a fantastic 2D puzzle platformer and a highly satisfying experience.\n\n[h1]Highlights[/h1]\n\nThis game reminded me many times of Thomas Was Alone. It has similar very-simple visual styles and simple but satisfying mechanics, but what makes 140 so different and special in its own right is the focus on puzzles and progression. Some sections are relatively easy, some sections are ridiculously hard, but every one of them uses some combination of rhythm, sound and timing to engage the players hands, eyes, ears and brain and delivers with a rewarding one step forward.\n\n* Little things like the respawn noise making the same rythm as sections of gameplay also stand out\n* The boss fights are varied and just as fun, they're very well designed\n\n[h1]Mistakes[/h1]\n\nThe main complaint against 140 is its short length, and while you'll most certainly be left wanting for more if you're a hardcore platformer or you're expecting something more like Super Meat Boy, 140 is by no means too short for its price, especially considering the more deadly mirrored levels. It isn't given the chance to become unwelcome and I feel it delivers a short, excellent and memorable (given the content) platforming experience.\n\nThat said, it's important to understand that if you're not looking for something punishing that requires a lot of patience then the mirrored levels aren't going to add much for you and you'll be left with just an hour to two hours of play time.\n\n[h1]Recommendations[/h1]\n\nPriced at just \u00a33.99/4.99\u20ac/$4.99  it's probably fair considering the content is great, and while the main levels can be beaten in an hour, the mirrored levels add another hour, maybe two.

Pretty standard platformer fare, although the little twist on this one is that everything moves to the beat. I enjoy myself a good rhythm game - here's lookin' at you Space Channel 5 - so it's a pet peeve of mine when a \"rhythm\" title has nothing to show for it other than a few elements moving to a basic pulse. From the screenshots I assumed 140 would be a prime example of that, but was proven wrong almost as soon as I started the first level.\n\nThere is no screenshot in the world that can truly demonstrate how flawless the rhythmic aspects of this game are. [b]Everything[/b] responds to the music both technically and visually, whether it's the way an object moves, how it changes aesthetically to \"describe\" a sound, or how the background music morphs, builds and fires off as you plunge further forward. It also offers a whole lot of rhythmic complexity, so if you were expecting to breeze through by counting 1-2-3-4 then brace yourself - we're talking tied notes, dotted rhythms and syncopation with this one. Finally, I especially loved some of the fantastic audio-visual moments that this game offers up, which I won't spoil but can guarantee you'll love seeing if you happen to be musically minded.\n\nGetting worried that I'm talking about music and rhythm a lot? I wouldn't worry too much. The game is still playable if you find it hard to clap in time; it just means that certain obstacles will feel much, much harder to get through as the answer almost always involves just listening. Thankfully, the default levels come with unlimited deaths and generous checkpointing, so as long as you aren't aiming for every achievement you'll be fine.\n\nSo, the final verdict? 140 is a solid testimony to the rhythm-crossover genre, and I would recommend it to anybody who enjoys a rhythm game. I'd also give it a try if you're just looking for something a little different to play, as I'm not sure I've ever seen a game like this before. However... the second I post this review I will be uninstalling the game and never playing it again. Funny considering I'm singing such high praises of it, right?

The degree of colorgasm varies by level, but most of my experience was wrought with eye strain. For a very short game like this, you don't want a headache to be your lasting impression on the player.\n\nBeneath the pain is a fairly enjoyable precision platformer. The game doesn't have any real 'puzzles,' aside from figuring out where you need to go and not flunking the jump (which happens often), but the integration of the music is the real selling point. Hitting a checkpoint adds a new instrument to the soundtrack, and a new mechanic to the level tied to that instrument, and the mechanic is then used to progress.\n\nIt's a very compact experience, taking only an hour or two and sticking closely to its minimalist aesthetic. However, the levels really drag on; there are only three of them, and if the game runs you two hours, that's about 40 minutes per level. It's not too bad at first, since the checkpoints are quite frequent and there's hardly any delay to respawning and trying again. If the game ended after the third level, with no extra content, this would be an overall positive review; however, completing the main game unlocks a set of 'mirror levels,' and the game falls apart then.\n\nFirstly, the mirror levels invert all the colors, leading to even more obnoxious color palettes than before. Then you replay the same levels, butmirrored - an interesting idea, except now death starts you over from the beginning. Of what might be a 20+ minute level. Which will end with some sort of bullet-hell boss. And good luck spacing your jumps if you're trying to defend your eyes from a painful assortment of hot pinks and sun yellows.\n\nYou need to learn these levels deeply, and practice them often, and dedicate lots of time to completing them. This is the core problem with this segment of the game: it is a 1-2 hour experience that then demands significantly more commitment in order to 'complete' it. You don't HAVE to finish the mirror levels, but if you uninstall it then, have you really \"completed\" the game? Since you need to complete the mirror levels to unlock all the achievements, it suggests the devs don't think you've won until you've gone through that hell.\n\nIf you are content to play only half the game, you probably won't regret it. But overall, 140 does not respect the player's time, and as a result I won't recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1435621217, "timestamp_updated": 1435621217, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487882", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16787380": {"recommendationid": "16787380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082649849", "num_games_owned": 3884, "num_reviews": 140, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435620352}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Simple platformer with colorful graphics.

It mixes a rhythm game with a platformer, where as it goes on you'll need to use the abstract but enjoyable electronic music in order to time your movements.\n\nVisually it's extremely simple, but surprisingly appealing and even beautiful at times. Screenshots absolutely do not do it justice. I feel the slick animations in time with the music and sound effects, particularly in the boss encounters, raise the visuals above what you'd expect from such simple assets. Even the way the character morphs between shapes while jump and move is brilliant, even better than the squash and stretch animations of Thomas Was Alone.\n\nMechanically I felt the game did an excellent job at throwing new ideas at the player constantly, while giving concise organic lessons before throwing them into something more difficult. Each of the 3 bosses I fought had that small learning period as well. The checkpoints are frequent and I was rarely frustrated. It seems some players aren't even aware of the \"second half\", as they only appear if you go through the main menu back into the game, and go just further to the right than you had to go the first time. These 3 extra levels seem to be identical to the original 3, but mirrored left to right, using different color combinations, with permadeath... I didn't realize it the first time I tried the first mirrored level, until I died and spawned back at the intro. I decided to give it another crack and I was able to complete it without dying on the next try. The level of stress shoots through the roof, as the whole level becomes as tense as the hardest sections of the game. I don't really enjoy that level of difficulty, specifically the concept of punishing failure with repetition, but in this case it's not really extra content, so it can be safely skipped if you're not up to it.\n\nMy playtime so far, beating 4 of the 6 levels was just shy of an hour, but I quickly fell in love with it's simplicity. It doesn't match the charm of Thomas Was Alone, or the unbelievable visuals of FEZ, but it's damn good for what it is.

So \u00e4hnlich habe ich mich auch gef\u00fchlt und ich muss leider zugeben, dass mich 140 geschafft hat. Das traurige aber war, dass es laut Statistiken knapp 38% aller Spieler durchgespielt haben. Ich geh\u00f6re da leider nicht dazu, ich geh\u00f6re zu den \u00fcber 60% die aufgegeben haben weil das Spiel f\u00fcr mich einfach zu schwer ist, ich empfand es als bockschwer und es hat mich geschafft.\n\nBis ich aber schlie\u00dflich aufgegeben habe, weil ich das letzte Level nicht geschafft habe hat es mich gut unterhalten. Ich fand halt nur das Ende zu schwer, bis dahin ging es fast noch, da hat es nur daf\u00fcr gesorgt das ich mal ne Blutdrucktablette mehr nehmen musste als sonst. Aber Spa\u00df beiseite. Im Grunde ist das Spiel super gelungen, ich k\u00f6nnte also trotz meiner Entt\u00e4uschung keinen Daumen nach unten geben, weil meine Spielerfahrung zum Ende einfach an meinen Skills h\u00e4ngt, bzw. h\u00e4ngen bleibt.\n\nIch w\u00fcrde also behaupten, dass sich das Spiel an diejenigen Spieler wendet, deren Frustgrenze etwas h\u00f6her liegt als meine, die gerne bereit sind dasselbe Level immer und immer wieder zu versuchen und sich nicht klein kriegen lassen.

A person who not only considers himself a decent gamer, but a decent musician as well. It's confusing and frustrating, at the most difficult obstacles I find myself sitting down for a half hour or more attempting to complete it. At this point I've been put through so much frustration that my emotions actually are non existant so much so, that when I complete the obstacle I feel no satisfation whatsoever. I'm not even happy it's over. I've lost all will to complete the game, but I try to anyways.

Also, there should be a warning for the final battle on level 3 saying \" you will be here for a while, bring food, water, and sunglasses to protect your eyes\". \n\nTips:\n\n1. Have your girlfriend sit next to you while play so you have someone to choke when you're angry.\n2. Have emergency ready for when you feint after playing so long trying to get pass the end for level 3.\n3. Write a review because you can't beat the game and you're really angry.>:[\n\nPros:\n\n1. It saves your progress after you've completed the \"ENTIRE LEVEL\".(Best idea ever.)\n\n2. Your character is a square and circle.(Boringggg!)\n\n3. You'll die before you finish the game.(I'll be at your funeral if you do die from playing this game)\n\nCons:\n\n1. If you exit the game it starts you from the beginning of the level and not the check point within the level.\n\n2.

It certainly had a few frustrating parts that had me cursing at my monitor from time to time, but overall, an impressive little game. I finished it in one sitting, but if you can get it for like...2 bucks or something, it's nice. If you like electronic music that's fairly melodic for the most part, you'd probably enjoy the music in this game. What was really cool was how all the stuff in the world (except you) that moves around, moves to the beat of the music, and you can plan your moves based on that. I never expected to recommend a game I'd never heard of that looked so simple, but it's quite good.

Sadly it's rather easy to fall out of this experience, not because of the puzzles and skill-jumps (which are pretty diverse, I give you guys that) but because the background PERMANENTLY flickering/pulsating in some distasteful colourations, that at least gave me some queasy stomachtime (a first in my years as a gamer.

Discounting the final \"boss\" stage, the game simply asks you to be aware of the obstacles changing with the rhythm. As for the final \"boss\" stage, it's not challenging as much as it is frustrating. The rhythm still tells you when to act, but precicely how to act is randomized.\n\n\"minimalistic\"\nThis isn't always a positive descriptor; it certainly isn't here. The extent of your controls are \"move\" and \"jump,\" and neither of those have any variable function. When you move, you will always move the same speed. When you jump, you will always jump the same height. The entire game can be played through in about one hour, which is good because there's no save function. There's not even a game menu.\n\n\"abstract colorful graphics.\"\nThe aesthetic feels like a Mondrian fever dream, full of harsh lines and contrasting colors. It's easy enough to understand which square you are and your goals, but that doesn't make it more appealing to look at.\n\n\"Rhythmic awareness is required to overcome obstacles\"\nCan you count to four? Congratulations, you've mastered the rhythm of the game. So much of the game's playtime is spent simply staring at the screen, waiting for the right moment to move rather than actually accomplishing anything.

Es una idea estupenda, y de hecho, bastante satisfactoria, a\u00fan as\u00ed, tiene sus puntos flojos que me gustar\u00eda ver cambiar.\n\nPros:\n-La m\u00fasica es estupenda y realmente te da una muy agradable sensaci\u00f3n al jugarlo, algo dificil de explicar a no ser que sea probado, solo por esto merece ser hechado al menos un vistazo.\n-No tiene ning\u00fan tipo de texto o di\u00e1logo lo que no tiene que necesariamente ser bueno, tampoco algo malo, pero si es algo importante, debido a que nadie tendr\u00e1 problemas por no entender debido a que no est\u00e9 traducido a un idioma espec\u00edfico.\n-Al terminar el juego, se desbloquear\u00e1 una versi\u00f3n m\u00e1s complicada de los 3 niveles principales d\u00e1ndole un toque de rejugabilidad.\n-Es un juego en el que morir\u00e1s muchas veces, y por ser este el caso, se agradece que su sistema de reaparici\u00f3n sea r\u00e1pido, as\u00ed, haremos m\u00e1s intentos en menos tiempo.\n-Funciona en cualquier PC, no necesita mucha potencia, por lo que podr\u00eda funcionar en un celular (m\u00f3vil).\n\nContras:\n-Es muy corto, de hecho, solo dura 1 hora y media como est\u00e1ndar, esto variar\u00e1 de la cantidad de veces que uno muera, a mi me dur\u00f3 2 horas la primera vez, lo rejugu\u00e9 una vez y me dur\u00f3 1 sola hora, si lo hago nuevamente quiza dure 40 minutos. El juego posee 3 niveles con 1 jefe al final de cada uno que debo admitir, es bastante complicado. Cada nivel est\u00e1 dividido en 5 fases o secciones, por lo que son 15 secciones de alrededor 2 minutos sin contar a los jefes.\n-Poca rejugabilidad, al finalizar los 3 niveles principales se desbloquear\u00e1n otros 3 niveles que son iguales, pero en reversa, agreg\u00e1ndole dificultad, a eso se le suma el hecho de no poder morir, lo que lo hace bastante complicado, a\u00fan asi, no tiene mas contenido.\n-Falta de opciones, el juego de hecho, ni siquiera tiene men\u00fa, lo incias y ya arranca, tampoco se podr\u00eda cambiar mucho, pero algo b\u00e1sico como el volumen de la m\u00fasica y el sonido adem\u00e1s de poder cambiar los controles se agradecer\u00eda (el juego se cierra menteniendo la tecla escape en cualquier momento).\n-Falta de mec\u00e1nicas, poco m\u00e1s que moverte y saltar, de hecho, donde realmente se innova es en los jefes, ah\u00ed el modo de juego cambia por completo y son los 3 muy distintos de otros. Al ser tan corto, no llega a ser repetitivo, pero podr\u00eda volverse mon\u00f3tono.\n\nA fin de cuentas, tiene sus cosas buenas y malas, teniendo en cuenta el precio esperar\u00eda a ofertas para comprarlo, a\u00fan as\u00ed es un juego bastante disfrutable.

It makes other minimalistic games look complicated.\n\nThe entire game is made out of the three most basic shapes: circles, triangles, and rectangles. These shapes are all colored very simply and don't even have any texture (except for the grey static that kills you). There's a reason no artists were needed to develop this game; calling the graphics in here \"art\" would be a bit of a stretch.\n\nHowever, what saves this game from being as boring as its graphics is the exceptional soundtrack. After all, it's a rhythmic platformer, so the music [i]better[/i] be good, since it's essential to the gameplay. Fortunately, the music is great, and it fits the gameplay perfectly.\n\nIronically, for a game that has such an amazing soundtrack, you won't find an official OST [i]anywhere[/i]. This is because the music is truly part of the gameplay, and so it's not as simple as just playing one long sound file in the background like most games do; the music is affected by what is happening in the game. The result is that the music you hear will vary slightly each time you play the game.\n\nUnfortunately, that means we are left with no soundtracks to listen to, apart from the title screen and level select music, which are probably the only real tracks you can listen to without actively playing the game. To listen to any of the music that plays during the actual game, you'll have to settle for watching videos on YouTube. An unofficial OST put together by fans can be watched [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEzP3MHLOmA&list=PLSwiiZF6c9CYrvMG-uNkkqzb6J3_-DhBP&index=1][u]here[/u][/url]. While these videos are very well done, it's such disappointment to have no \"real\" tracks for each of the three levels.\n\nAnd yes, you heard that right; the game only has three levels. Each one takes about seven minutes to run through, maybe 15 if it's your first time. That's means there's less than an hour of gameplay for the entire game. \n\nBut what about the mirror levels? Well okay, there are actually three more levels after you beat the first three, but I'd hardly consider them new levels. They're literally exactly the same as the first three levels, but reversed (instead of moving right, you move left). They have no new content, no new music, and no new bosses. It's just the same thing over again, except that this time, you move backwards. Oh and one more thing, the mirror levels have no checkpoints at all.\n\nAnd that's the reason only about 2% of players have actually completed the mirror levels: no checkpoints means that one mistake will send you [i]all the way back[/i] to the very beginning. At this point, the game turns from fun into frustrating. I guess that may appeal to some hardcore gamers, but for most people, it's not worth their time doing something that isn't even fun.\n\nI really wished there would be more levels, since having only three is just pitiful. After you beat the third boss, the game looks like it goes into a \"3D\" mode for a bit. That could've been a cool way to start off the next levels. Too bad it didn't.\n\nAs much as I wanted to write a positive review for this game, because I [i]loved[/i] the three levels it did have, I simply cannot recommend a game that has so little content. [u]Minimalistic design is ok, but minimalistic content is not.[/u]\n\nTL;DR: Great game, but there's not even an hour of content (unless you're a masochist willing to play the mirror levels, then there's a few more hours of [i]frustrating[/i] content). Now I know $5 isn't very much, but neither is <1 hour of gameplay. If the game had an OST bundled with it, then it might be worth it.

The controls are simply the directional keys and the set-up options should ensure smooth play on any machine.\n\n140 is an indie gem that warrants a play by any lover of challenging platformers.

I very much enjoyed this, but not a single negative review has invalid criticism.  I got this in a humble bundle in which my intent was to get \"shadow warrior\" for 10 bucks, so this was essentially free.  If I would spend the 5$ price tag on it, I'm not sure.  Let's run through:\nPROS:\n>Extremely unique and cool design, artistic choices, and animation\n>Nails \"minimalism\" on the head; super simple, no main menus (launching the game throws you straight into gameplay, and exiting just crashes the game)\n>Purveys a strange feeling of both relaxation and stress at the same time\n>The best kind of challenging- causes you to rage, but silently, and you still feel motivated to play on.\n>Rythmic beats that interestingly are consistent with environmental hazards\n>Super unique, awesome boss battles\nCONS:\n>IT'S SO DAMN POINTLESSLY SIMPLE.  Your character is nothing more than a shape that runs at uniform speed jumping on platforms.  I kid you not there is absolutely nothing to it.  No meaning, no unique controls or gameplay mechanics.\n>It's short.  I like nice short games, but this is a whole new level.  Steam tells me I have 1.8 hours in it, and this includes having beaten the whole game start to finish, spending 20 minutes in the \"hardcore\" mode*, and having replayed the first 1/3 of the entire game\n>*The only gameplay addition is that once you beat the game, you unlock a mode whereby the world is mirrored, and dying causes you to start the game all over.  Is it welcome, and adds to the challenge? Of course.  However, if it is added as an actual \"feature\" of the game, that is pathetic and seriously lazy.\n\nOverall, I honestly had a ton of fun in this game.  It was unique, enthralling, enchanting, and challenging.  However, this does not justify even a 5$ price tag.  If you have endless money, got this in a bundle such as myself, or are just overwhelmed by curiosity, get it.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed.   However, if you're only mildly curious and don't care too much, don't bother.

and Sworcery EP' and 'Fez'. The music itself as well as some of the visuals are quite reminiscent of 'Fez' although they are very different games. \n\nWhen you first open the game, you are treated to the music straight away. There is no menu or text, other than the large '140' in the middle of the screen. Upon pressing any button you are thrust into the game itself, still with no instructions. This isn't a game for those new to the platforming genre, but those who have played the simplest flash game will easily be able to understand what to do. \n\nEach level of the game has it's own music to match the obstacles present there. You will need the music on, as all the obstacles are synced up to the beat and mastering the rhythms can mean the difference between life and death. At the end of each level there is a boss, it will challenge the skills you have learnt through the level leading up to it. These bosses aren't the typical 'fights' you may be used to from other games, but I find them to be fairer and more challenging than most. \n\nI absolutely adore the visual style of the game and the way it matches the music so well. The simplest touches can effect the game massively and when you first play it can be overwhelming, especially when you die. The patterns in the background that seemingly dance to the music fit the rest of the levels perfectly and aren't distracting or annoying, even when you are stuck on a particularly difficult section.\n\nOverall this is one of the best platformers I have ever played, the controls are extremely responsive and I never felt like I died because it was the game's fault. For the price there is the perfect amount of content in my opinion. With just enough challenge and variety to give you a few hours of gameplay, and even more if you want all the achievements.\n\nI would give '140' 5 stars, 10/10, 8/8 or whatever rating system you prefer, I love it. I will certainly be buying the soundtrack and I hope a sequel will be made one day.

The platforming gameplay is as shallow as one can imagine, your only actions consisting of jumping and moving (always at a fixed speed). Since the whole game revolves around stage hazards following musical rhythms, you always progress at the pace of the levels, waiting for the right time to advance. Boss fights are a little more interesting for deviating from the main game in different ways, though you are still a \"slave\" to the game's music-based mechanics in those.\n\nOh, and you can beat the main game in around 1 hour. It's like, three stages long, and after the end you can replay mirrored versions of those same stages without checkpoints (you can't get much lazier than that with hard modes). That's about the entire game for you.\n\nThere's nothing broken about 140. It's just that it's extremely short, unfullfiling and has as much content as miss south carolina's skull. For the price it charges, you can get way more interesting games around gabe's funhouse.\n\nEDIT: so a fourth stage has been added recently, which is nice, though my critique still stands.

Generally these features come in the form of timed jumps and moving to specific beats given by the background tracks.\n\nI personally found these concepts unique and enjoyable but what let the game down for me was its lack of content. There are only three 10-20 minute levels (six, if you include the inverted levels) and there is a disturbing lack of instructions or information about anything going on when you begin the game (to be fair though the goal is easy to pick up once you get started).\n\nIn terms of story, well... there is none... but the gameplay and audio are the two aspects in which this game shines. You can tell that the musician that produced the upbeat soundtracks and catchy sound effects spent a lot of time perfecting it for the game.\n\nThe controls are quite smooth and handle well, this makes the difficult parts of levels somewhat more tolerable (especially the bosses).\n\nIn terms of replay value, you have the opportunity to play the three original levels again without checkpoints for a real challenge but apart from that there isn't really anything else to do in the game.\n\nI would suggest getting this game if you feel like something different from your average platform game and have a decent hour or two to spare but apart from that I would give it a miss. I feel bad about rating this game negatively but I felt it didn't live up to the expectations I got from reading about the game before I installed it.\n\nRating:\n\nStory = N / A\nGameplay & Controls= 3/5\nGraphics = 3/5\nAudio = 4/5\nReplay Value = 2/5\nDifficulty = 3/5", "timestamp_created": 1418132590, "timestamp_updated": 1418440887, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13290072": {"recommendationid": "13290072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030923808", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434339737}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple minimalistic game.

The game requires you to jump and roll your way through a series of timing-based challenges, all of which are set to the throbbing, toe-tap-worthy beat of the game's Electronic Super Joy-esque soundtrack.\n\nYour goal throughout each level is to collect dual-colored orbs and then return them to various checkpoints. Each returned orb causes the level to fluctuate, activating moving panels and changing the game's color scheme. To collect each orb, you'll be faced with moving blocks, grey-matter platforms that kill you on contact, and tricky tests of your ability to time impressively challenging jumps. However, the levels provide plenty of checkpoints, saving your progress before each threat you face.\n\nThe end of each level features, like most games, a boss. The boss levels of 140 are the only times when your otherwise peaceful shape is armed with a weapon: a beam that shoots out of your shape automatically in time to the music's beat. Boss levels are long, creatively designed levels that require you to avoid projectiles while also correctly timing your attacks, making them often frustrating (but, in the end, rewarding) moments of the game.\n\nThe only noticeable downside to 140 is its astonishing lack of true save points. While there are several checkpoints within each level that you can return to when you die, exiting out of the game entirely will cause your progress in each level to be lost. Therefore, each level must be beat in one sitting, otherwise you'll simply have to start completely over next time you come back to the game.\n\nDespite this, the game is both fun and challenging and, if you manage to make it through all three levels, the end will unlock three extra bonus levels that allow you to play the first three levels backwards without checkpoints.

Not including the three after-levels, there are three levels in total (which I'll admit is too little) and they all have a little end boss which is very much not little at all. They are all challenging and will test your rythem and twitch skills to a very full capacity. The game never uses text or dialouge, everything is explained in game and the game trusts your intellect and instinct enough to figure it out yourself.\nAnd it does a damn good job at it.\nNothing in this game is based on luck. You'll never feel frustrated at \"The game\" (and if you do, you're wrong) because every time you die, it's on you.\n\nGameplay: The game is really tight (However there is less than a split second difference between when you push the jump key and you jump, which never ruins anything but cannot be truly called \"tight\" for this reason) and the quirks and mechanics of the game are all explained by playing it. Your own experience with this game will depend on your paitence, rythem skills, and ability to perceive and predict your enviornment. If you're used to games that hold your hands and tell you where to go and how to do what you need to do, and you don't want to play any other kind of game, then you will not like this. If you don't have a high pain tolerance, you will not like this game. If you aren't paitent, you really won't like this game.\nAnd that's okay, just don't bash this game for being \"Luck dependant\"\nAlso, this game has the hardest final boss I have ever played ever.\n\nAudio: Being a guy who makes music himself, I can appreciate this game's music well. It isn't at all complicated (I don't think I've heard a level with more than 6 tracks) but it all flows together perfectly, and the feeling of putting an orb in it's place and hearing the song get more complicated is perfect. The levels are heavily (but not totally) influenced by the music, and in some cases, you are too. I just wish this game came with the OST, but that is not something I can fault the game for.\n\nGraphics: No screenshot you will see of this game will do it justice. Almost every screenshot of this game will make it look like a bloody Atari game, and I agree, still, this game is very, very ugly.\nBut, you put it in motion and everything changes. \nEVERYTHING.\nThe way the (completley geometric) shapes change, to the beat of the music is wonderful, and the fludity of the world makes it feel alive, even if there are no human constructs in the world. \nIf you don't want to buy the game for the graphics, at least watch a video, perhaps that will do it more justice.\n\nAll in all, I would give this game a very high, (As in the only reason this game didn't get a 10 is for a few very miniscule gripes) 9/10.

Consisting of only 3 levels, each about 5-10 minutes in length, 140 is stretched out through its increasing difficulty and bosses, which can last multiple times longer than the levels themselves, even with generous checkpoints.\n\nThe game shines brightest in the platforming sections, implementing the mechanics I've mentioned before and having a smooth difficulty curve that is never unfair, as you always know when it's your mistake. The first two bosses as well are decently balanced and don't take long to adapt and beat, even after a few tries, but it is the third and final boss that felt more of an excercise of frustration than any sort of challenge. \nThere is a method to the third boss' madness, but you have to adapt to a lot of variables to beat this one, even after you finally wrap your head around the constantly changing mechanics after every checkpoint. \n\nBeating this boss provides no payoff either, as there is no new content following, nor a nod to your accomplishment outside of the standard steam achievement. You do unlock mirrored versions of all three levels, which could be fun if they didn't turn off checkpoints. Getting all the way to a boss only to die and lose all your progress and gain elevated blood pressure is not my idea of fun. If you're excessively masochistic and want to have an awful day, go for those challenge levels, but otherwise 140 is a nice surprise that has some nice shining moments, even if it never lives up to its potential.", "timestamp_created": 1416512858, "timestamp_updated": 1498262944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13014520": {"recommendationid": "13014520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098098839", "num_games_owned": 2443, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501889352}, "language": "english", "review": "A remarkably good platformer with great music and video style!\nRating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605", "timestamp_created": 1416479727, "timestamp_updated": 1431888502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13012669": {"recommendationid": "13012669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007746696", "num_games_owned": 456, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416457522}, "language": "english", "review": "The Good:\nCheap\nMinimal\nGood platformer design and nice music\nInteresting bosses\n\nThe Bad:\nShort\nMostly too easy or too hard (checkpoints or lack thereof)\n\n140 is worth a small price because it's a little bit of fun.

Turns out, I'm only half way there. But my first playthrough was an enriching experience. The feedback loop the player recieves in the form of a changing soundtrack serves as an indicator of progression, and encourages you to keep going. This background mechanism combined with levels that layer on their complexity with each checkpoint the player completes, demonstrates a subtle mastery of game design and player psycology. 140 could have gone down the route of asking the player to hunt down the next check point, hiding them in places that require a good quarter of an hour to forage for - or a couple of minutes looking at youtube videos - but teh developer's focus on \"here and now\" gameplay, where reflexes matter more than cunning, make the game instantly accessible and addictive.\n\n140 is neither music game nor platformer: it surfs a gorgeous in-between.

The game does mix these up somewhat, with blocks which trigger other blocks to appear or disappear, expanding and contracting blocks which hover in place but can crush the player, blocks which temporarily turn themselves into ground which will kill the player if they touch it, and, in one level, brief, periodic periods of anti-gravity, where the player will fall up (but cannot jump off the ceiling).\n\tThe game is quite brief, consisting of only three levels of increasing difficulty, and checkpoints are frequent \u2013 a very necessary feature in the third, quite difficult level of the game. The player must periodically retrieve floating orbs and bring them to platforms to transform the level in order to continue on their way through it, and each time the level grows deadlier and more complicated, until they have reached the end of it.\n\tAt the end of every level there is a boss of sorts, though in reality they are merely segments of very different gameplay. The first one is a fairly traditional boss which shoots at the player from above and splits in half every time the player shoots it with a little hovering shooter which fires automatically every few seconds, requiring the player to time their presence underneath the boss to harm them. The second one has the player navigating through an environment which feels like they are racing down a narrowing track as an enemy whose touch means death zooms back and forth past the player. The third and final one has the player trying to defend themselves from enemies, pointing their blaster at them before they attack; as the player only has one shot per group of enemies, they have to make it count. This last one is quite frustrating as it plays heavily with interface screw, first by making it so that the blaster rotates either 90 or 180 degrees before firing (in a predictable pattern), and secondly, by shifting around the entire screen and thus giving the player only a very tiny amount of time to react. This was the most frustrating part of the game, and was a poor design choice as it felt very awkward rather than like a fun puzzle.\n\nGraphics\n\n\tThe game has a very simple aesthetic to it; everything in the game is a geometric shape of some sort, and the player themselves turns from a triangle to a circle to a square depending on their movement and actions. Even the music is very simple, the game being silent at first, then gradually building up a more and more complicated soundtrack which beats in time with movements of objects in the environment.\n\nFinal Summary\n\n\tThe game is decent overall, but it is very short, and the third \u201cboss\u201d is quite obnoxious as the game experimented with interface screw in the place of interesting gameplay. On the whole the game was not terrible, but given its very short length, with the entire game likely taking no more than an hour to beat, and the frustrating final \u201cboss\u201d, there\u2019s not a whole lot to recommend beyond its aesthetic.\n", "timestamp_created": 1415271114, "timestamp_updated": 1415271114, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477346", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12812494": {"recommendationid": "12812494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005863770", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503292314}, "language": "english", "review": "Casual and fun or a brutal speedrun.", "timestamp_created": 1415254228, "timestamp_updated": 1415254228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12804194": {"recommendationid": "12804194", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990017273", "num_games_owned": 521, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1409857215}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um joguinho SIngle Player estilo Frustration [aquele genero na qual voc\u00ea vai errando varias vezes o que tem que fazer at\u00e9 passar raiva] ele \u00e9 bem interessante e muito bom de jogar, a unica coisa ruim \u00e9 que s\u00e3o poucas fases e deixa vontade de continuar jogando depois que termina.", "timestamp_created": 1415204864, "timestamp_updated": 1415204864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12800717": {"recommendationid": "12800717", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997277540", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507104141}, "language": "english", "review": "Tis an enjoyable game.

In the platforming you have to go from point A to point B to dodging and using objects in the map. The game has in total 3 levels with each of them having 1 endboss. The endbosses are pretty challenging and really let you know you have to focus on what is happening on screen but also to the music that you hear.  What I like about the game is that it explains itself with no text, using only music and the world itself. This really helps the minimalist style. As you progress through the game, you can really hear and see that the levels are getting harder and have to think about what you are doing. The game is well designed, so when you die you know it is your fault. The music is also fun to listen to.  I first played the game on okay-speakers and later on a good-headset. The difference in enjoyment was huge. So I would recommend good audio equipment while you play the game.  Steam says the game took me in total 104 minutes.( I have to say that I left level 2 partway through once, so I had to start from the beginning of level 2. So the games doesn't save your checkpoints in a level. ) After you complete the main game you also unlock all the levels in mirror mode where you don't have any checkpoints. This can be fun for people who are searching for a challenge but I am not interested in playing it. All in all, the game was fun but felt too short for me.

The obstacles in the game are essentially variants of moving and jumping to the beat while attempting to dodge \"noise\" blocks; this can get quite tricky as the game goes on.

Finishing the game unlocks the ability to play mirrored versions of each stage with no checkpoints, which is a bit too much for me to handle but it is nice that the option is there. \n\nThe aesthetics, on the other hand, are hard to care about. On one hand, the use of color is vibrant, the way everything syncs to the music is cool, and there are some neat visual effects to see throughout the game. On the other hand, simplistic shapes are basically the only objects in the game and the tunes themselves are rather bland as well. The game is minimalist to the point of feeling uninspiring, and I can't say it will stick around in my memory for long.\n\nOverall, while it's not the most interesting game out there, I had fun with 140 and it certainly didn't overstay its welcome.

It's short (3 levels + a backwards version of all 3), but challenging and interesting. The music is excellent (if you like that sort of thing) and you really have to get into the rhythm to proceed.

While this seems like a fairly simplistic asessment of the game, it is nonetheless the most apt description of it, as 140 is also a fairly simple game. what makes it stand apart from others is perhaps the fact that visually, it is quite strike, with bold colours changing constantly, and nary more that a square or circle in terms of geometry. The visuals aren't lazy though, with fluid animations and some obvious effort in creating a unique style. Perhaps a major draw is the relationship with the music, with many of the platforming segments relying on rhythm to complete, and some of the background visual elements being connected to the music that is playing. There are also boss levels which change the gameplay completely, one being a pseudo shoot em up, another being a boss fight which uses rhythm and posistion. \n\n140 is, for the most part, a fairly decent game. Whether or not it's woth getting for it's price point (currently at $5.00), thats another matter entirely.

No, quite the contrary, when you reach the final 3 levels you will rage (especially if you suck like me lol). The music, I may add, is amazing. It builds up as you painstakenly platform your small square/triangle/circle around the map. I find it truly a great game and one you should pick up if you feel like getting a semi-nostalgic feeling to old school platformers (but that may just be me being weird). Be wary of the bosses for they show no mercy to all players of 140. But either way, if you pick this game up on just a whim from a sale, or buy it full price, I'm sure you will enjoy the game.\n\nEDIT: They added a 4th (and 8th) level to this game.

The objective is to gather multi-colored orbs and bring them to these half-circle zones nearby. Each orb adds more complexity to both the soundtrack and the level, and opens up more of it.

Platforms move and/or disappear in time with the music, which actually helps, because it allows you to work out the timing required. \n\nAt least in the first three worlds, there's no penalty for death. You simply start back at the last checkpoint. I'm not sure if that continues on. It can be kind of frustrating, since some of the timing does need to be precise, and the boss fights can take a few run throughs to work out the pattern.\n\nI enjoy the music, which is pretty beat-heavy electronica.

It is certainly a pleasure for a game to reveal its internal rules during play and  it can especially tricky to facilitate communicating these mechanics to the player without the (sadly common) excessive use of text or game-immersion-breaking tutorials. The use of audio to communicate game mechanics is not a unique idea but it is certainly novel and implemented in a very stylisticly unique way here.  A distinctive aesthetic, with a colour palette that either harks back to the Commodore 64 Era or is instead very modern (all that is old is new again)\nVery pleasant to listen to and look at and handles very well.\n\nHowever: 140 is not without criticism. The paradigm of 'either Perfection or Failure' is (to me) a very old fashioned design choice and not one that is particularly endearing as repeating some sections can quickly become tedious. \nThe \"bosses\" are a particular nuisance and rapidly became annoyances to be overcome, 'gates' of memorization and tedium to pass through to get to the next level.\nOn the checkpointing system, it may actually be this that lets the game down.\nDespite VVVVVV being, as a friend put it \u201cBa***rd hard\u201d, the use of checkpoints allowed the less dexterous of us to muddle through without losing our minds in frustration.

One major con of [i]140[/i] is that, although the trailer tells a different tale, there is [b]minimal emphasis on rhythm.[/b] Though it seems odd to say that about a rhythm game, it's true; the designers spent more time on style, and not enough on functionality and creativity. The second boss, for instance, not only had no rhythm, it [b]was easier without the music[/b]. This should never be true for any rhythm game: there should be an emphasis on rhythm.\n\nGameplay is fun at times, tedious at others. It's quite easy, most of the time. To be honest, it's quite forgettable. The third boss is amazing, and the first one isn't that bad, but anything in between failed to excite me.\n\nThe appearance of the game, holistically, is nice! I really like the minimalist feel. The controls, as well, were simple and nice.\n\nThe designer probably considers the three secret achievements, which can be gotten by going through a mirror-mode version of the levels without dying ever, as \"replay value\".

The music helps drive the player into moving and jumping at the right times, to over come obstacles. The music is quite smooth and soothing electronic tunes. Nothing too extreme.\n\nIn each of the levels, you're main objective is to go along and acquire a small floating ball, which starts to follow you after you've bumped into it. You then take it to a 'point' which then changes the music playing, and how the level looks / flows. New areas are accessible, static objects start to move and even the gravity can change.\n\nThe best part of this game, in my opinion, are the boss fights at the end of each level. Each one is well thought out, and brings a challenge to the player fighting them.\n\nIt's quite a short game, around 45 minutes to an hour, if you just want to play the base 3 levels.\n\nYou'll get a lot more time out of the game if you choose to do the 'advance' levels, which are mirror worlds of the first three, without any check points.

In most 'rhythm' games  music marches forward at a pre-determined speed, dictating what you must do and when in order to keep up. 140 is different. 140's background music consists of loops, each loop a single instrument, and each instrument synchronised with a particular mechanic. Platforms materialise and disappear in time with the snare drum, for example. Once you have learnt each mechanic and understood its rhythms, only then does the level advance, adding new layers to the music and therefore new mechanics to the game.\n\nIn 140 you are driving the music, rather than vice versa, and that's something new, something more enveloping, something brilliant.\n\nI can only fault the game for its short length. It could be two or three times as large without exhausting the potential of its core concept, and I wish it would have been explored further.

You play as a square, and your goal is to get to the end of each level (3 in total). The only controls are left/right and jump, so it's not exactly complicated, nor are any of the jumps particularly difficult. What makes it interesting (and marginally challenging) is the timing of the jumps - you are typically tasked with jumping on or through obstacles that appear, disappear, or move in time with the music. Once you figure out the pattern of a particular area, it's pretty easy. The soundtrack is your typical indie-electronica type music, but suits the game well. Visually, although it is very simple, the look is pretty cool and even hypnotic at times (it looks like an Atari 2600 game on acid). The game only takes about 1 hour or so to complete, so keep that in mind when contemplating a purchase. If you like indie platformers or rhythm-based platformers and don't mind the price-to-length ratio, give it a go.

This is basically the same as \"The Impossible Game\", in the sense that it's a aesthetically minimalist platformer in which gameplay is based upon rhythm, although you actually get to control your minimalist avatar. \n\nSo you'll jump your way through 3 levels based on the background music plus 3 bossfights. While the bossfights can be quite challenging, the rest of the game is fairly easy, although I imagine that the 3 additional stages where you have to get through without dying once can be quite challenging depending how well you can deal with rhythm, but I as a musician have no trouble at all.\n\nThe actual levels can be beaten in less than an hour which is just way too short for $5, but since I've bought it at a Humble Bundle sale for $0.33 I can let that slide. Still I feel that for what it is, it could've easily been a free flash game on Newgrounds or Kongregate. It's just so incredibly insubstantial, there's no narrative to engage you with, just raw gameplay that while competently executed in the end becomes somewhat repetitive since there's really no incentive for me to play it again and again. Stuff like FEZ at least had a kind of atmosphere that you can soak in based on its art and music where you can just simply leave it running, look at it and relax, but 140 doesn't offer the same appeal. And the reason I bring up FEZ is because there's actually a quite lengthy part of that game which is also based on timed jumping and rhythm, but it is enhanced by the rest of what the game can offer.\n\nSo in summary, it's one well executed idea that can be beaten in less than an hour for $5. If you feel that justifies the cost then go ahead, but I can say I'm glad I waited for an opportunity to get it cheaper because I would've felt ripped off at its regular price.", "timestamp_created": 1408712845, "timestamp_updated": 1408713200, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11818989": {"recommendationid": "11818989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062649200", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430046698}, "language": "german", "review": "macht Spa\u00df,\nauch wenn es leichter sein d\u00fcrfte.\nACHTUNG: man kann nicht speichern,\nalso spielt bis nach dem Bosskampf durch oder ihr m\u00fcsst das ganze nochmal machen.", "timestamp_created": 1408711482, "timestamp_updated": 1408711482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11818899": {"recommendationid": "11818899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025263992", "num_games_owned": 427, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404530411}, "language": "english", "review": "140.

I spent $5, and I don't regret a penny of that price, regardless of the length of the game.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nPros:\n-Simple\n-Challenging\n-Good progression of complexity\n-Great soundtrack\n\nCons:\n-Too short, not enough levels (~40 minutes playtime)\n\nScores:\nGameplay: 8/10\nSoundtrack: 10/10\nStyle: 10/10\nGraphics: 9/10 \nAddictiveness: 10/10 \nOverall: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1406854514, "timestamp_updated": 1406854514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11494488": {"recommendationid": "11494488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099574257", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1406823728}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0434\u044b\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438. \u0420\u0438\u0442\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442! \u041d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u0441\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d \u0442\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0430 \u0438 VVVVVV. \u0416\u0430\u043b\u044c, \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0430\u044f.", "timestamp_created": 1406829251, "timestamp_updated": 1406829251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11487688": {"recommendationid": "11487688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045313606", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1406787297}, "language": "english", "review": "Pixel-art indie game that incorporates musical rhythm for platforming.

After that, you'll have an added challenge which I'll try later, but it does not seem to add much to the game, except for the challenge. (More on that later)\n\nThe game has 3 level, each with a Boss Fight in the end. 3 levels may seem waay too few content, but it's not quite like that. Basically, you'll unlock parts of the levels as you progress. You can see it as 3 chapters, but every level is integrated in the same space, which is essential in this game!\n\n\nAs usual, [b]presentation[/b]!\n140 has a very minimalist art style, with psychadelic color schemes, and even some glitchy-ness to it. It's not your typical \"2D retro pixelated graphics\" that lots of game are using. Not at all. This game stands on its own, even regarding the art style. \nIt never gets too intrusive, presenting all the information you need very clearly.\nI really liked it! Besides, the background also pulses in sync with the music, so it adds to the whole \"atmosphere\".\n\nIt's hard to talk about its [b]music[/b] without talking about the [b]gameplay[/b] at once! All I can say for now is that I enjoyed the music for this game. It's pretty much electronic dance music, but there's more to it than that.\n\nAs I said before, it's a primitive platformer. Well, kind of. \nAll your character does is move to left and right, and jump. The jump time it also always the same, no wall jumping, no double jumping, no gliding, nothing of the sort. It's as simple as it gets.\nWell, how can you still make an unique game with that?\nMusic!\n\nSimilarly to Beatbuddy, this game uses music to its full potential. Every obstacle in the game is coordinated with the beat of the music, which makes this game all about timing.\n\nAnother game you can take in mind is BitTrip Runner (and the BitTrip franchise in general) regarding how it does its music. You're given layers of the songs as you progress through the game. It starts off with a very simple beat. And it builds on it, introducing new layers with the new obstacles. And it works perfectly!\n\nI've been interested in how music can be integrated into gameplay for a while, and this game is a really, really good example!\n\n\nAnother noteworthy aspect about 140, is the way it [b]teaches[/b] you about every obstacle. It never throws something very complicated at you, before explaining what it does, exclusively through gameplay. And music, ofcourse!\nSometimes, you'll hear a new melody in the background, and you'll immediately know that you have to look for something around you. And you'll usually be presented with a very simple obstacle, to give you a general idea of how it works. Only then, come the bigger challenges.\nI never found it frustrating at all. It was a bit too easy, maybe, due to the very forgiving checkpoints (which I don't exactly mind). But if you're fond of challenge due to the lack of those, do not fret! \nAfter you beat the game, you'll unlock 3 new levels. These are the previous 3 levels, but mirrored, and without checkpoints.\n\nEvery big level, is made up of smaller levels. Each time you complete a smaller \"level\", something else will start moving, and with it comes a new layer of music. And that's pretty much how the game works. You just keep going to new areas until you reach the Boss fight. \nIt is indeed very simple, but also very effective! The way you need to pay attention to the rhythm of the music to overcome challenges, the way even the background contributes to that, it all comes together and gets you very in tune with the game. It's surprisingly immersive, and has a very good flow!\n\nAnother thing I've found great, was the Boss fights! There are only 3, but they play really differently to one another. They're almost minigames, and reminded my of something like SuperHexagon. The surreal visuals, coupled with the music, and twitch gameplay... yeah.\nBut it's good! And it's not actually like SuperHexagon, only those elements. They're also timing based, and they do a great job of teaching you on the fly, with each phase getting progressively more complicated.\nIt really does follow the design of the rest of the game. They start out simple, presenting you how it works, and then they'll challenge you, all through the game, without any words.\n\nOne nice addition is also how they end the Boss Fights. After the crazy colors spinning around, and the hectic music from the bosses, it suddenly stops. You're back into the Hub world, where everything is silent and grey. It's a very well timed break to the flow of the game. Well done!\n\nI could see it being frustrating if the Boss fights are also a necessity to beat the Mirrored levels, without checkpoints, but I can't hold the game responsible. Its main content is accessible to everyone, and the rest is there to people fond of the old-school approach, I'm totally OK with that!\n\n\nAll in all, despite its length (again, 1hour, maybe even less, if you rush through it), this work is very, very well done. From its presentation, to its level design, and how it merges music and gameplay... I can't see much to complain about. \nI'm really surprised about it, great little game!\nIf you're a bit skeptical of the 5\u20ac it costs... Well, maybe wait for a sale. But seriously, get this game and try it out, if you're into rhythm games, or platformers. It's definitely worth your time.", "timestamp_created": 1405966482, "timestamp_updated": 1405966482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518950",

I can confess to having completed three playthroughs myself - one of them probably under the influence of something.\n\nPlayers will be in awe of the minimalistic and colourful visuals, as this is a game that is indeed rife with aesthetic beauty. One stage of a level will be coated in an abundance of pastel colours, while the next will feel as warm as a summer's day in Dubai.\n\nThe music is dynamic to the extent that it feels like a living, breathing, entity. Fortunately, for fans of electronic music like myself, the progressive techno soundtrack will melt your ears and have you floating away like you were having the best heroin trip of your life.\n\nThe gameplay is wholly unique in that it utilizes the ancient greek theory of Synesthesia in it's gameplay design. Platforms will move and enemies will shoot in time with the music like a well rehearsed play. In fact - this feature is the key to completing the game, as paying close attention to the music for cues, will signal when to traverse a platform or blast a ball of oppressive static into nothingness.\n\nThere are slight issues with the lack of a pause feature, framerate issues on lower end systems, and not being able to change the settings in the game client itself and only from the launch window. Fortunately, none of these are even anywhere close to ruining the game's integral experience.\n\n140 is a relatively cheaply priced game, suited for stoners, contemplative thinkers, and sensory junkies looking for a quick and potent fix.", "timestamp_created": 1405925474, "timestamp_updated": 1491670126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.950617", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11343049": {"recommendationid": "11343049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101919114", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496753636}, "language": "english", "review": "After writing some critics on BeatBuddy, now it's time to write on something much better, to mention.

None of the challenges were at all satisfying to complete.\n\nSuper Meat Boy-style finesse is rarely required--just basic timing and a LOT of waiting. Many of the levels are designed to make gracefully darting through them impossible: for every second you actually spend moving or jumping, you'll spend a second waiting for a platform to materialize or move or deactivate, because it wasn't set correctly when you reached it. With such bite-size levels and challenges, these constant five-second mandatory pauses become grating, and clash with the music, which has a tempo and rhythm that encourage a sense of constant motion.\n\nAs for the art style? Eh, it's inoffensive, not great. It's going for a sort of pseudo-De Stijl look: each level contains lots of blocks of two arbitrary colors, with slightly different values for different level assets. The music might be tense with warm colors, or softer with cool colors, but that's the extent of the game's tonal consistency: the level mood jumps around from somber to exciting to chill with no real rhyme or reason.

Each time you complete a segment you save at a checkmark, which makes it less painful when you fail over and over again. Some people may struggle with the timing or precise controls required to complete some of the challenges, but I wouldn't call any of them impossible.\n\nMost objects on the screen, besides your character, are simple squares. It doesn't get much simpler than that, but somehow it works. The graphics are vibrant and trippy at times, moving and changing colors to match the electronic music. The music by the way is fantastic! As you complete chapters and other key parts of the game the music will shift to reward the player with some awesome sounds.\n\nMy only complaint is that the game took me less than 90 minutes to complete. When you complete the 3 main acts (which takes 1-2 hours),you unlock the same 3 acts, but in reverse and without checkpoints. This should provide me some extra play time, but I'm certain that I will get frustrated and give up without the checkpoint handicap.

I recently picked it up in the Humble Eye Candy Weekly Bundle, in which it was included for its aesthetic. I hadn't read anything about it yet, so I decided to just fire it up and go in cold. What I ended up playing was one of the best games I've ever played that uses music to engage the player with the gameplay mechanics. \n\nThe game's pretty good about ramping up the difficulty moderately, introducing new stage mechanics at a decent pace. The only time I really felt it was at all unfair about it was the boss fight at the end of Level 2, which seems to just involve guesswork if you don't know the pattern already. The rest of the time, my deaths were due to my own mistakes, either getting off rhythm or trying to rush too soon. Getting a feel for the rhythm of the music is crucial to successfully navigating a level and completing the boss fights.\n\nThe visuals are minimalist, but colorful, with the backgrounds pulsing in time to the music as the stage elements change. The bright palette is in stark contrast to Limbo, which was directed by the developer of 140, and it fits well with the electronic soundtrack (which I'll likely be purchasing). \n\nThe game was fairly short, as I finished the main levels within a little over an hour. There are additional levels which are mirrored versions of the main ones, but they're without checkpoints. I'm not sure I'll ever be able to finish those, but they're an option for those looking for an even greater challenge.\n\nI'd advise using a gamepad if you're more comfortable playing platformers with one, even though the controls are very simple (just directionals and jumping). As you can imagine, it's unfortunately not a game I'd recommend for anyone who has difficulty with hand/eye coordination. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game, especially at the price I bought it at, but even at its (low) full price, I'd still recommend it at its short length, just for the simplistic brilliance of the way it melded gameplay and music. Even though I probably won't be able to finish the challenge levels, I'll probably go back to play through the old ones just to re-experience them.\n\nIf it's playable for you and you're a fan of platformers or music games, definitely check it out.", "timestamp_created": 1405382852, "timestamp_updated": 1405382852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512820", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11238634": {"recommendationid": "11238634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141398788", "num_games_owned": 391, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498324767}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun game.

Now you may be thinking that this might be a Nintendo hard game that makes up for its short life span with complicated levels, and really the levels aren't that hard at all, in fact the game doesn't really start to show its teeth until the third and final boss fight, and that's only because I'm completely thick and it took me a while to get used to the switch of gravity. I expect with practice you could probably speed run this without glitching in 25 or so minutes. \n\nThat is not to say that this is bad, by no means at all is it bad. Were it a free flash game it would be up there in most peoples top 10s. My only real complaints is the hit box seems to be a little bit out.\n\nYou see this is a platformer with static areas that will kill you and push you back to the last check point. There are no enemies to speak of which makes the experience feel a little lonely, rather the environment reacts with the music in the background which means that you have to get into rhythm with the sound track in order to progress which makes a very nice experience. The graphics are very simple and programmer arty which is fine with me. I see this as a very clever way of doing your first steps if you know a little about code but don't have the resources to hire a team. However everything is incredibly blocky but its stylistic, I am kind of on the fence for graphics. The hit detection seems a little unfairly sided to the static too, resting against a wall that suddenly changes will kill you, its only a pixel but you should really give the player the benefit of the doubt in most cases.\n\nWhen you finish the game you can play a hard mode version of it, sadly though all the stages just go from right to left instead and they removed the check points. Not really worth much but at least its there, might add another hour or 2 to the game if you want to get your moneys worth. I would also like to point out that this game runs fine on low graphics for me but was a bit slow on high with my native res. I personally could not tell the difference and as its just 2d squares coloured I don't really see how you could up or lower the graphics, my rigs a little old now but it might be something for you to look out for.\n\nAt time of writing the game is \u00a34 on steam and when I give my rating and recommendation I have to take that into account. Now remember I like the fact that these smaller flash type games are getting on steam, they are good fun little games, but they need a little bit more than what this offers and in this case its length. As I say, were this a freebie on newgrounds it would probably be getting an 8 or a 9 but as it stands I can only really give it a 4. \nDon't take that as it being crap though! This score is just relative to its price. Make sure that you do play it if its in a bundle and you own it. But unless you really really really love the music/minimalistic genre you might want to wait until its a steam sale for at least half price or you might feel disappointed.\n\nRemember 4/10 just means its below average, it doesn't mean you can't have fun with it.

For the time playing, you will probably enjoy it. But that's the problem, for the time that you play it. This game is extremely simple, I've only played for almost an hour and I've beaten the game. Now, the other problem is when you beat a level. The only things which this 'character' can do it move left, right, and jump. At the end of every level are bosses which kill you in one shot. It's trial and error but someone takes the fun out of it when you get it right. It just feels out of place. This game is also 5 bucks and for how long you'll play it, I don't recommend it.

That's probably a great way to enter it, because it turns out it's actually a well crafted little platformer.\n\nLike many other great platformers that strike a balance between challenging, inventive, and not too long (VVVVVV, Thomas Was Alone, Limbo all accomplish this in different ways), 140 is a very nice little game.\n\nThere is a sort of rhythm component, in that the music will assist you in timing a jump or move just right with the soundtrack. But aside from that, it's just simple, clean, and nicely honed gameplay that makes this game definitely enjoyable. The jumps feel weighty and good. The responsiveness of a stop is very comfortable.\n\nThe charmingly inventive character is a great touch. A square when you're still, a circle when you're moving, and a triangle when you jump, with nicely flowing animation between shapes. The simplicity really works in favor of 140, rather than against it.\n\nThe only part of the game configuration I'm not a huge fan of, is where save-points exist. Only after you complete each grouping does the game save. I'd love to take a break and come back to the final stage for example, but I have to play the several levels beforehand each time I want to get to that level for example. Not a dealbreaker in a game of this size and scope, but annoying if you can't devote enough time to completion of a group of levels in one sitting.\n\nThe game isn't much more than a few hours (you can play it through the first three stages, then in reverse direction back through those same stages). But those are well made hours, and only the final stage is really punshing (for me it's equivalent to a mental tongue twister, which I find too frustrating to see through).

I was pleasantly surprised to find that there wasn't much variety to the soundtrack so it quickly fell off and became boring. Though, it did slightly change...you can still feel it being recycled. \n\nThe graphical choice was probably more so due to lazyness, lack of imagination, time restraints, or even budget. Either way, this kind of style has been done before. Despite the fact that graphics obviously don't make the game...the devs could at least tried to do something new with it. (I do like the equalizer, though. That was somewhat nifty.)\n\nGameplay is straight forward. However, it becomes almost tedious. Your timing has to be absolutely perfect otherwise, you're going to have to hear the annoying static sound along with a checkpoint set back. At least there's checkpoints...\n\nThough, I do not mind pinpoint precision. Games like Super Meat Boy and Electronic Super Boy require such. But...they have more of a satisfaction to it once completing levels and a better soundtrack. \n\nI do understand that soundtrack and graphical choice are matter of opinion. Nevertheless, I believe that only goes to an extent. \n\nIf you're interested in this game; I suggest waiting for a pricedrop.

The first and second levels were really fun, and I liked how the music tied into the game.  The levels would change in time with the song so you could time your jumps accordingly.  Once I got to the third level, though, the game got really annoying.  It didn't seem like the levels were really in time with the music anymore, instead they beat to their own drum (which you couldn't hear).  It just ended up being spawn and die over and over.  One of the problems I have with the game is that if you are standing level with a static area (a kill area basically) you will die, even though you aren't actually in it.  This gets really annoying in the third level when you have to time your movements with these boxes expanding and contracting.  Another thing that I noticed is that your character always moves the same amount and ignores how much you move the left stick (on an xbox 360 controller at least).  It seems like it ignores anything <50% and treats anything >50% as equivalent to pressing A or D on the keyboard.  This also is really annoying when trying to deal with those expanding boxes.

It's simple elegance pervades every corner of the experience, to the extent it almost manages to push gameplay entirely out of the picture. The basic shapes and purposeful use of contrasting colors invokes comparisons to Mondrian, with a calculated simplicity and conspicuousness that elevates the presentation from rudimentary to a captivating example of minimalism. Moved by the beat of a reserved yet distinctive audio track, the experience feels alive as you move through levels, perfectly in sync with each other as if performing an elaborate dance.\n\nIn this way, you are something of an outlier; awkwardly progressing through areas you ought not to be in. This creates an odd sort of disconnect between the gameplay and the atmosphere, as while both work wonderfully together to create a brilliant rhythm based platformer, their is just something [i]off[/i] about all of it that left me somewhat unsatisfied over the whole affair. I enjoyed every second of the one hour experience, but I also feel no need to spend anymore time within the game.\n\n140 is undeniably a very cool game, one which demands a closer dissection of its elements than you would assume at first glance, the core of which is incredibly tight and polished. It made me think and left me feeling smarter for overcoming its challenges, but as the small side project of a single developer it is, it shouldn't be expected to have the amount of content or range of mechanics to feel like a fully fleshed out concept.

What sets it apart is that the platforming is built around rhythm elements, much like something like Beatbuddy or Sony/PSN's \"Sound Shapes\". Basically, as you go through the levels there are timed obstacles, platforms, and other mechanics that play along with the dirty, dub-step / glitch electronica that comprises the music. Periodically you will collect an orb which you bring to a set point, which causes the colour palette, sound, and mechanics to shift. At the end of each of the three levels is a boss which functions kind of like a shoot-em-up-ish genre. If you die, the screen dissolves into analog TV fuzz as the music glitches out even further and you respawn at the nearest checkpoint.\n\nCheat code: If you want to make the game easier, go slowly and count out a beat. Mostly the rhythm patterns seem to be 4/4 or 8/8 so if you can count the beat in your head you'll be able to crack the code no problem.\n\nWhether you feel like you'll get $5 out of such a short game is up to you, but I found it to be a great experience. Often times when I died, I chuckled in spite of myself because I found the rhythm mechanics very clever.

It doesn't sound like anything special but its execution is excellent. Controlling the game is easy. Your low speed and high acceleration make every move easily predictable. Every challenge is layed out before you in a way that allows you to almost instantly know what to do to overcome it. There was never death that I felt was unfairly due except perhaps for the bosses. However, even those really were my fault. The feeling of unfairness just came from how overwhelmed I was by them on the first try.\n\nEvery motion in the game apart from yours is set to a steady rhythm. Obstacles move in time with the music and platforms appear on-beat. You are a geometric shape that changes as your state does. A circle while moving on the ground, a triangle while airborne and a square while standing still. Every level consists of simple, timed platforming during which you must, at regular intervals, collect a little pick-up (whose movement represents a mechanic you're about enable) and take it back to a specific point to progress. Each level culminates with a boss. All of which are slightly different but are all basically about avoiding obstacles thrown at you as opposed to the ones you jump at in the platforming sections.\n\nThe music is sort of recycled for use throughout the entire game. Specific elements of it are only heard when particular mechanics come in to play so it's not always entirely the same but it's definitely not a different song. Again, the exception to this is the bosses. They come whith their own musical flavours. Consistent with the rest of the game but separating them from the platforming sections and each other. This all works in the game's favour. The music feels a part of the game's design and it helps you play. It's also awesome music.\n\n'140' is very short, consisting of only three levels each taking around 20 minutes on the first try. The game does offer replayability to you through a mirror mode in which there are no checkpoints. I can easily see only a minority (although not necessarily a small one) being drawn in by this since, once you've beaten the game, you've seen and conqured every challenge. What more is there to do? Well, this \"hard mode\" poses its own challenge by asking you to remain consistent in your abilities for an entire level. Fail and you must start from the beginning. Even if you reach the boss.\n\nPersonally, I liked this. I seems a solid enough goal to aim for seeing as you know what's coming is simple timing and fairly easy platforming. Even the bosses aren't as fraustrating a second time. If the game hadn't set this challenge for me, I might not have decided to try it but since it did, I gladly took it on.\n\n'140' is an enjoyable distraction.

If you like electronic music and music/rhythm games, this is for you! In short, 140 managed to provide me one of the most immersive and memorable experiences I ever had in gaming. Let me settle down and tell you about it.\n \n140 is a minimalistic and abstract platformer rhythm game. There are no lives, menus, tutorials or hand-holding: it's just left, right and jump. The levels are composed of platforms and blocks/obstacles with different properties that respond to the \"periodic nature\" of the music/rhythm, comprising of minimal dubstep with a subtle hint of chiptunes. (At places, it reminded me of Krafwerk). Listening to the music/rhythm is essential to figure out how the obstacles work, enabling you progress. This discovery involves some trial and error, also because the game is a bit challenging, but there are frequent seamless checkpoints that almost immediately respawn you when you fail. As you progress along each level the music and rhythm patterns become more complex, making for more complex obstacle sequences, which creates a sense of momentum and exhilaration as you successfuly understand and manage to execute how to get past an obstacle. At the end of each of the 3 groups of levels, there is a \"boss\", which is more challenging but also spectacular and rewarding.\n\nThe overall design of this game is nothing short of brilliant: the music and visuals/blocks are synergistically woven together; the platforming elements and obstacles nail the sweet spot between recognizability and making you pause a moment to observe and think; the flow and pacing are perfect and the aesthetic, both in visuals and music is the definition of minimal beauty. Because everything revolves around the rhythm of the music, the game subtly demands that you get into it and \"feel\" the rhythm, which in turn gradually makes the experience more and more immersive as you \"attune\" yourself to it. Looking back on this, I think it's truly a remarkable feat of game design. Managing to beat the final \"boss\" was immensely rewarding: it made me feel like it was an epic end to a most amazing adventure. Digital bliss.\n\nBecause \"dying\" hurts the flow of the music, I felt the game instilling me a desire to play without errors on further playthroughs, and mastering this game and being able to finish it in one go withouth dying would be a truly special achievement. You could try just that: after finishing the game you unlock a special mode where you can start from the beginning with the levels mirrored horizontally and, if you die, you start from the beginning...\n\nThere are only two minor concerns worthy of note. Firstly, the game is somewhat short (it took me about 1h to complete? in one sitting) and left me wanting more. Secondly, the final \"boss\" is quite difficult and I suspect will frustrate some people because it involves not only realising the pattern but also using very fast eye-hand reactions.\n\nHowever, there is something very special about this game, so minimal and yet so complete.", "timestamp_created": 1404611991, "timestamp_updated": 1404611991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11093533": {"recommendationid": "11093533", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977187317", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507599193}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game I've played in a long time.

Minimalist abstract art and design at its best. Every puzzle is unique and rewarding. As I played I became more and more aware of the music until I was relying on it to progress.\n140 is a game with no filler. You must use everything you're given to solve the puzzles. But at the same time, this game is not your enemy trying to make you fail while you battle against it to win (like in most games e.g. your typical shooter or racing game), it is there to guide you through by teaching you as you go. When a new element is introduced in a puzzle game, so often I am just left to figure out myself what to do with it. In 140, you are subtly shown the mechanics of new elements before you must interact with them. This allows the player to always feel confident and in control. As the complexity and difficulty increased at just the right pace, I began to find some puzzles had a bit more too them than they seemed. I would have to watch as the elements reacted to the music and learn their patterns. Some of the puzzles may take you a minute or two to complete, but you are never confused for more than a few seconds. It\u2019s the perfect mix of mental and physical skill.\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed games like Thomas Was Alone or The Impossible Game you will probably enjoy this. \n140/10 \n", "timestamp_created": 1404482979, "timestamp_updated": 1404482979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11067955": {"recommendationid": "11067955", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972126747", "num_games_owned": 601, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404476001}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun but short game.

That is my only complaint about this game. The third boss is really, really, REALLY hard. Maybe there is a pattern I haven't figured out yet, but I tried to beat to boss for over half an hour with no success. Other than that, the game has been very enjoyable. You don't have to like EDM to enjoy this game, but it does help. There were many times the game surprised me or made me smile.

However, I don't believe I've taken the time to write a negative review of any steam game before this, so take all that into consideration when reading this review. \n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME\n\nForgive the caps lock but I had to be clear, this game is a very good example of what people mean when they call a game \"indie\" as a pejorative. Is it lazy? Yep. Is it self congradulatory? Yep. Is it overpriced and exploitative in design such that it takes a lot of time to beat just because of bad game design choices? Yep.\n\nThink what you will about \"miminalism\" but time and time again the indie community has shown that they believe it to mean \"getting away with being lazy by calling it an artistic choice\". This game uses solid colors like crazy, they aren't \"beautifully rendered\" solid colors, they are just solid colors. In every area of game design aside from the music (which is decent) this game cuts corners on production. \n\nFirst of all the mechanics consist of little more than basic \"avoid hazards, time jumps\". The hazards are a lazy static design. Honestly, this game looks a whole lot like what a game would look like if you set out with the idea of \"making the game requiring the least amount of effort to make and charging the most money you could get away with\". And you might suggest this is cynical or baseless, but think of this: This game does not have an options screen. You can adjust window size before playing but once you are in, you are in. Why doesn't this game have an options screen? Pretty much every game in the past 20 years has had an options screen, but for some reason this game is \"above having an options screen\". \n\nWhat nerve the developer must have to think so highly of this game. And now, for the coding, this game could be coded by most decent coders in a week or two. That's it! Compare that to a game like \"The Binding of Isaac\" a game with so much more depth and variety that most programmers couldn't even code or imagine. And take note, both games cost the same amount. That's the biggest insult is the price point. This game has THREE LEVELS. That's it, and how does the developer pad out the game with \"additional content\"? He adds THE SAME THREE LEVELS again but with the X axis inverted on the level. \n\n\"Mirror mode\" is acknowledged as incredibly easy to do, it's one line of code most of the time, inverting a level can be done in under a minute, it is absurdly easy, that's why some games have it as a \"cheat code\". Here, the almighty genius of a developer thinks so much of his game that he thinks these 3 inverted levels without checkpoints constitute \"new levels\". \n\nWhat really irks me though is that somehow some people seem to be buying into this game. Read the reviews, I can't wrap my head around it, are we really such sheep that this passes as a quality 5 dollar game? I can't imagine all those reviews are real, I don't want to believe I live in a world where so many people could be such suckers. This guy is selling the video game equivalent of snake oil and people are gobbling it up. \n\nTo everybody who loves this game, I have a suggestion: You can play games of superior quality like this online FOR FREE, google kongregate or newgrounds, or google some game jam like ludum dare where people make games in literally 3 days and the top 200 entries for any game jam will be better (and less lazy) than this game. AND they will be free. I know for a fact that this developer has made more than enough money scamming people with \"minimalist\" game design. The least he could do if he was going to be a lazy game designer is make it pretty. LIMBO is a pretty unremarkable game gameplay-wise, but at least it looked like the art took more that 2 seconds to make.   \n\nBy this point I'd estimate most people have tuned out this review because it's quite long, but I had to make it and I had to make it long because I feel that passionately. Most of the indie game design community are very kind and selfless people they want their audience to enjoy their game. Here is the most damning thing about this game, and I truly believe it:\n\nI don't think the developer cares if you like their game, only if you buy it. \n\nI truly believe that, I got this game on some hefty sale and I still feel like I was ripped off. There are so many games of this and better quality online for free, this game has no art production value, very little innovation, and ONLY 3 LEVELS. It's a platformer with no art assets and only 3 levels that costs 5 bucks. Do you think a developer so selfish as to try to peddle such a scam of a game deserves any of your money? \n\nPlease do not buy this game, if for no other reason than to teach developers that they should care about their audience and not take advantage of them. Keep the indie community a better place by supporting good developers and not giving money to lazy exploitative developers such as this one.", "timestamp_created": 1402741274, "timestamp_updated": 1402741274, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496296", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10464511": {"recommendationid": "10464511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001196918", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507357659}, "language": "english", "review": "Very short, but it's an excellent rhythmic, minimalist platformer.\n\nI want more games like this to exist.", "timestamp_created": 1402704059, "timestamp_updated": 1402704059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10463997": {"recommendationid": "10463997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050899815", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453275419}, "language": "english", "review": "Updated:\nDespite my old negative review i stayed and played this game (unlock all achivement's as well :D ) and now i am writing more maturely I recomend this game  even if its only a 3 stage game so dont go for it if its higher that 2 euros\n\nit is a really nice puzzle game with some electirc music on background\npropobly will give you some rough time in some certain levels but it is a puzzle so you must figuer it out (duh!)\n\nNow for the achivements the onlything you need to know(if you go after Dont Die Achivements) i am pretty sure that you will be like\n \"I am so fucking happy that i finished it and you will say \"FUCKING YEA I MADE IT ALIVE, BOOYA\" \"", "timestamp_created": 1402699784, "timestamp_updated": 1453275862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10459688": {"recommendationid": "10459688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042777301", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1406533883}, "language": "english", "review": "The bad thing of this game, is how short it is.", "timestamp_created": 1402672412, "timestamp_updated": 1402672412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10439664": {"recommendationid": "10439664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014179304", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472490680}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun game, it is an interesting concept that we shall ponder for a moment.

There is music playing that, spoiler-alert, tries to hypnotize you in order to make you move your triangle-square-circle hybrid to the beat. As you run, gun and jump through this elaborate world, you start encountering evil staic whose only goal is, much like in a real-life geometry class, to make you pay attention and stop doodling. There is also a hardcore mode where failing once makes you restart the game from the beggining instead of at the checkpoints as usual. I find this mode to be a bit insulting as in real life you do not get second chance, so it is in my humble opinion that in hardcore mode if you die once the game should auto uninstall and you should get a steam badge saying you are a failure, once again to keep up with how it is in real life.

Parsem\u00e9 de check points, vous traversez un parcours en contr\u00f4lant un petit carr\u00e9 (devenant une sph\u00e8re lorsqu'il bouge et un triangle lors des sauts), qui n'a que pour actions de se d\u00e9placer vers la gauche ou la droite, ainsi que de sauter.

Instead of rushing through (which will certainly result in several deaths), most sections of all the levels almost REQUIRE you to pause and wait for the path to become clear. In some ways this is enjoyable, as it emphasizes the mental reasoning over twitch reflexes, but it can also come across like driving down a highway and hitting every light red; even if there is absolutely no rush, it gets frustrating.\n\nEverything in the game is responsive to different track sections that the player activates to progress through the game, but the caveat to this is that while the level is perfectly in time with the music, this actually requires the character to move OUT of sync with that same music. Instead of jamming to the beat, you're really jamming in counterpoint, almost like you are actually fighting against the track. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but for those who have grown up on or mastered DDR, Guitar Hero, Elite Beat Agents, or even games like Audiosurf or the Bit Trip series, will find themselves getting a number of annoying flase starts when they try to move to the music and match it's timing.\n\nThe controls are smooth, and incredibly simple. This could easily translate to a smartphone, using the gyroscope for movement and a single button press to jump, or the bottom half of the screen split for left and right movement, with the entire top half of the screen as a big jump button that the thumb for the inactive direction can press. \n\nIt only has 3 levels, which are then recycled into mirror levels that strip out all the checkpoints for extra challenge. There are \"Boss battles\" and I really enjoyed the first and second battles for these, but the final boss battle made the mistake of increasing its challenge by making it the player's ability to control their avatar more difficult, instead of making the boss smarter, tougher, or less predictable.\n\nDue to the small size, lack of opportunity for quirky/creative acheivements (all the current steam list that are merely \"beat X level\" even the hidden ones) that would add to replay value, I wouldn't really recommend paying more than $2 - $3 for it, preferrably on something like a humble bundle sale that would let you get it for multiple platforms. All the same, I DO recommend it.\n\nWhat this game really needs is a mixer level, that would let the player gather together and manually activate all of the different track section they had been able to aquire. This would easily add $2 to the total I'd be willing to recomend.", "timestamp_created": 1401163653, "timestamp_updated": 1401163653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10242037": {"recommendationid": "10242037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108680107", "num_games_owned": 1047, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441943428}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0439\u0444\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u043e \u0431\u043e\u0441\u0441 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0434\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043f\u0446 :D\n", "timestamp_created": 1401119785, "timestamp_updated": 1401119785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10241642": {"recommendationid": "10241642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014087627", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1401114072}, "language": "english", "review": "140 is a platformer + puzzlegame based on beats/rhythm/music.

The music is good dubstep thats also great game music at the same time. The game is quite minimalist though with just a title screen and level select. There is no menu, no saves and no pause.  But it turns out you dont need those things if you got good music and a game worth playing. I think some of the negative reviews might be from the games simplicity but the programmers werent lazy, they just knew what the game needed and what it didn't. The gameplay is based off obstacles that are in sync with the beat of the music. The more \"in the zone\" you are the better you'll be able to time your jumps and your movements. The music really makes the game and is best listened to loud enough to properly enjoy it, or at least use headphones because the music really is half the game. The game progresses in difficulty nicely, and there is a boss battle and the end of each level.

The graphics, although minimalistic, represent the playing field and hitboxes well (so you don't have any \"that shouldn't of hit me\" moments) and have a nice colorful vibe. 140's graphics are like abstract art, and you'll either love it or hate it. As far as sound goes, the music was very enjoyable and fit the game very well -- up-beat with a strong rhythm. After playing the game, I legitimately wanted to find loops of some of the game's music online. In gameplay, 140 is as simple as its graphics, which again may either be a plus or minus to individuals. As a straight-up platformer, I personally find 140 great: it's not too hard, but it's not too easy, either. 140's platforming definitely takes some practice, but it's nothing impossible, and you really feel like you master it as you play it. The only bit of simplicity in 140's nature that I find disappointing is its shortness; discluding the second half of the game, which will be spoken about in a moment, there are only three stages, and they can be beaten in 1 to 2 hours. Although they're long and unique from another, I still feel like there could have been more stages.\n\nThe second half of the game is, again, a major deciding factor for what people think of this game. For those who aren't in the know: after beating the first three stages in 140, you can play the \"mirror\" stages. These mirror stages are literally just the first stages again except inverted (you go left instead of right, which makes no actual gameplay difference) and with no checkpoints (meaning you must do the entire stage and boss without dying once). I've always been picky about adding difficulty by simply removing checkpoints, and I feel that this second half of the game is directly on the line of what qualifies as good or bad in regards to this. I stand by my point that repeating sections of a stage that you've clearly mastered is only a time waste, and the mirror stages are definitely guilty of this; however, I have to admit that, upon beating the last mirror stage, I felt genuine excitement and achievement (Get it? Because there's an achievement...?). From the first half to the second, the game spikes in difficulty only due to the lack of checkpoints, and although it can be repetitious to redo the whole stage if you die, it is also incredibly rewarding to beat it. Even after beating all of the mirror stages, I still feel like having more unique stages would be far more enjoyable than just repeating what was already given without checkpoints; however, those with a strong urge to master the game might get some extra time and enjoyability out of the game via these stages. Otherwise, the mirror stages may feel unnecessary as an element to the game.\n\nIn total, after having beaten all of the game, I recommend 140. The only gameplay I would question is the second half of the game because of its easily repetitious gameplay (from restarting a whole stage over if you die). The overall atmosphere and style of 140 can only be praised or spited, and I, for one, fall into praising it.

Instead of just doing things in rhythm, you need to really grasp how everything going on around you ties in with the music, then move through obstacles using that understanding.  Sometimes it seems like you're not going to make it, but if you've listened well, things will fall into place right as you need them to.  140's minimalism really puts the focus on the music and gameplay as well.  You're never left wondering if you need to pay attention to something.\n\nThe only downside, as others have noted, is that it's a pretty short game. There are six levels, and the last three are the same as the first three, just less forgiving.  It almost makes the game feel like a proof of concept, though a very enjoyable and well-executed one.

You gotta align your jumps and movements to the beat and it's often quite challenging, but satisfying when you manage to get it done. It's really cool when they introduce new mechanics, which each produce their own sounds that align to the beat as well. Within each level, the music keeps layering and changing, and the color scheme keeps switching. Very well thought out progression in these levels. And the basic, flat geometry and simple color scheme, although barebones and minimalist, are quite beautiful to look at and see in motion. Even better with the euphoric music and how well they complement each other. It has very interesting boss fights too, unlike what I have seen in any other game. Because they match the unique stlye and mechanics of the game. It's all very abstract and minimalist, but that is exactly what is intended and it enhances the mechanics that much more. Everything is tightly and cleverly designed to match a simple vision. It's really simple, but often the most genius things are the most simple. And that is how I can go into all this detail over some squares, circles and triangles.\n\nSo 140 is a great audio and visual experience, and a fun and challenging platformer.

The boss battles in this game is also truly amazing. Had a blast with all of them, and I spend most of the time replaying it over and over because I can't get it over with. The level transition is also pretty amazing. It keeps the gameplay smooth and fluid. For a game made using Unity, seeing this makes me wanna develop more games in Unity.

It syncs so well with the levels, and it's the core function of the game which is no doubt an actual \"rhythm platformer\". The platforms will sync well with the music. I recommend using headphones when playing this.\n\nThe best part of the game is the mirrored/inverted levels. Basically it's the same levels as the main ones but it's inverted and there's no checkpoints. So it functions like a no-death run.

Collecting items, landing on platforms, and nearing the game's checkpoint-like floating objects are all incredibly unique, rewarding, and expertly-crafted.

You really do have more control, to take things at your pace, to screw up as you will.\n\nThe game is short and sweet and well worth the $2.50 I paid.

It manages to be not just a gimmick and important for getting a feel for the timing of some of the more evil things they throw at you later in the game, some of which are rather clever and made me happy in the same kind of way first playing Super Meat Boy did (which I still need to go back and finish one of these days).", "timestamp_created": 1387723194, "timestamp_updated": 1387723194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8194419": {"recommendationid": "8194419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098768411", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513540711}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Puta adiccion", "timestamp_created": 1387713717, "timestamp_updated": 1387713717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8187805": {"recommendationid": "8187805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084007555", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1391686640}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0443 \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432 :) \u041d\u041e 3\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044f \u042f \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443", "timestamp_created": 1387690225, "timestamp_updated": 1387690225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8187279": {"recommendationid": "8187279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049706831", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1388026139}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah, it's pretty good.", "timestamp_created": 1387688187, "timestamp_updated": 1387688187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8182699": {"recommendationid": "8182699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015526752", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1387668375}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e", "timestamp_created": 1387671495, "timestamp_updated": 1387671495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8181365": {"recommendationid": "8181365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036402457", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393083809}, "language": "english", "review": "140 is a platforming game in which the music is integrated with the gameplay in a very nice way.

Somewhere between Fez, Thomas Was Alone, and Super Hexagon, this game strikes an excellent balance between visual effects, audial cues, and twitch gameplay. Taking up 1-2 hours of time, it's concise enough that it doesn't overstay its welcome, but you're not quite left wishing for more. Well worth the $5. \n\nThe visual effects are quite vivid, and may exacerbate any preexisting headaches or nausea. I had a minor migraine when I started and got along pretty well, but others may experience some more significant illness. \n\nThe gameplay was wonderful, intuitive yet challenging. I was never lost on where to go or what to do, yet continuously challenged to modify my reflexes to suit the ever-changing situations. The superb minimalism managed to convey exactly what needed to be done without any tutorial text or voiceover whatsoever, and stunningly subtle environmental cues. \n\nOverall, I heartily enjoyed this game and recommend it to fans of indie games and retro-style games, and split-second timing wizards. Visual effects could be too much sometimes, but the length was perfect and the gameplay was wonderful. 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1387126128, "timestamp_updated": 1387126128, "voted_up": true,

and trying to avoid obsticles that get in your way, which all work with the beat of the music. \nYou have to reach the end of each stage and collect a small object to put in its correct place, which is pretty simple.\nTheres 3 levels that are very short indeed, but at the end of each you encounter a challenge known as a 'boss' which can be a little tricky to complete but eventually you will get there.\n\nBut dont think this game is so easy, once you finish your 3 levels, theres 3 more levels known as mirror levels, and thats when it gets hard, you have to do each level without dying, which is possible but if you have no patience you will get angry fast! lol\n\nOverall an excellent idea of a game, controls are easy to use and no complaints on the resolution and graphics, perfermance is fine too.\nShould you buy it? yeh if its cheap why not, and if you want a challenge then go for it, its a good test of patience :)", "timestamp_created": 1387075821, "timestamp_updated": 1387075821,

This game is brilliant in just about every regard. It involves jumpy shapes and procedurally generated music.\n\n\nMusic - 25/10: Yes, it's that good. The entire game revolves around the music. All the puzzles in this game are based on the fluctuations the music is going through. Everything is really seamless; if you're just listening to the audio and you die somehow, it honestly sounds like part of the song even though it's very harsh static. The music also only progresses when you do, which in my opinion is one of the best things about the game - and it always sounds so seamless when it does. And besides, the \"drop\" that happens when you progress to the next sequence of a stage is one of the most amazing sounds I've heard so far.\n\nArt - 6/10: The art style is a bit like Thomas Was Alone, but not quite as nice. It's basically just a bunch of rectangles and circles and triangles. Nothing much. However, there are some really tiny details, like the jump and the level progression sequence. It does have a sort of odd charm to it though, which is why I'm giving it a 6 and not something lower\n\nGameplay - 8/10: You're essentially just trying to navigate your way through a series of obstacles and static-y square things. Nothing too special when considered by itself, but when you add the music to the equation, it's phenomenal. Everything changes based on what's going on in the music, for example, platforms will start moving as a new sequence is added to the ever-changing song. Really, the only negative is that the boss battles are a bit more trial-and-error than actually puzzle based, but honestly that's not a bad thing.\n\nPrice - 10/10: At $5, this game is a steal. Hell, I wouldn't mind if I had to pay $15 for it; it's just that good. If you're still not convinced, get it on sale when it's somewhere hovering around the $3/$4 range. You'll be glad you did.\n\n\nOverall Rating - 9.5/10: This isn't so much of a game as it is an experience. The music is so much more than brilliant, and the gameplay and art style works fantastically well with the concepts it's working towards. The only downside I would say would be the shortness of it all - it only has three \"stages\", but they're all intuitively designed and great fun to play.", "timestamp_created": 1386222834, "timestamp_updated": 1386222834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7920821": {"recommendationid": "7920821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041433896", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1382310262}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very awesome, though very small game.

It throws you right in and leaves it up to you to realize that the arrow keys are the only controls. \nIt's a straightforward platform game- jump on the platforms, don't fall, don't hit the TV static that kills you. Quickly you come to notice that the platforms and moving objects are all synced to the music, resulting in puzzles that require following the 4/4 beat of the music closely to predict the movement of objects.\n\nThe game is very simple, but just challenging enough to keep you going. It's a very short game. 3 levels, finished in 3 sessions of about 20-30 minutes each. Each level has a unique \"boss\" at the end with original gameplay. One has the feel of a Castlevania boss with your weapon only firing on a specific beat, another reminded me of SuperHexagon.

Ich versuche nur meinen Standpunkt als core-gamer zu er\u00f6rtern.\n\nIch wei\u00df nicht, wie ich auf die Seite dieses Spieles gekommen bin, aber ich bin froh dar\u00fcber. Nachdem ich mir den Trailer angeguckt habe, war ich der Meinung dem Spiel eine Chance zu geben, ohne mir mithilfe irgendwelcher Reviews eine Urteil zu bilden. Wo ich schon dierekt am Ersten Punkt angekommen bin:\nIch empfehle es. Lest euch meine Meinung am Besten garnicht weiter durch, es wird euch eventuell nur ein falsches Bild liefern  und euch den Spa\u00df rauben. Wer interesse an Platformern hat sollte sich es auf jedenfall einmal angucken. :)\n\nDie, die unbedingt wissen wollen weshalb es mir Spass gemacht hat sollen ruhig weiter lesen.\n1. Prinzip:\n  Eine sehr gutes Konzept meiner Meinung nach einen Platformer auf Basis der Hintergrundmusik aufzubauen, doch zun\u00e4chst ein groben \u00dcberblick: \nDas Spiel ist in 6 Level zu unterteilen, wobei die ersten 3 ein einfaches und die letzten 3 in schwieriges (f\u00fcr mein Niveau ^^ ) Leveldesign haben (differenzen sind jediglich fehlende savestates). Jedes Level wie ein durchschnittlicher Platformer aufgebaut: verschwindene Platformen, deathzones, bewegende Plattformen etc. Diese sind aber mit verschiedenen Kl\u00e4ngen, die sich im Hintergrund abspielen verkn\u00fcpft, das ist was diesen Platformer ausmacht. Dabei ist es das Ziel , indem man durch das wiederholte Schl\u00fcssel-Schl\u00fcsselloch-Prinzip von einem zum anderen Level gelangend, schlie\u00dflich den Boss besiegt, welcher schnell Verstanden ist und recht \"schwer\" ist. Nach dem Sieg \u00fcber den Boss gelangt man wieder in die Levelauswahl wo man nun in ein neues Level gelangen kann. \nZur\u00fcck zum Konzept: Die umsetzung dieser Idee ist gut gelungen, man hat einen smoothen \u00dcbergang von Levelabschnitt zu Levelabschnitt im Bezug auf die Musik, welche nicht, wie zum Beispiel bei IWBTG, irgendwann auf die Nerven geht. Ich pers\u00f6hnlich mag die Musik. Sie ist stak vom Bass gepr\u00e4gt mit lauter anderer Kl\u00e4ngen.\n\n2.Leveldesign:\nWie oben bereits erl\u00e4utert ist er recht simpel aufgebaut. Im endeffekt kann man die Meinung vertreten, dass sich die Level wiederholen, was auf die Begrenzung der Materialien zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren ist. Ich vertrete diesen Standpunkt nur zum Teil, da sich die einzelnen Sequenzen nur sehr selten wiederholen, eigentlich gibt es immer ein unterschied. Die Level sind auf jedenfall schaffbar, f\u00fcr mein Geschmack sogar recht einfach, von der Schwierigkeit ist das eventuell vergleichbar mit Mario, NICHT KAIZO MARIO!!!1! (fck dis game). Die Bosse sind gut konzipiert ... ohne spoilern zu wollen ist die 2. Stufe des 3. Bosses schon ein guter Mindfuck ^^.\n\n3. Musik:\nDie Musik hat keine wirklich Melodie bzw Ohrwurm Charakter, wie bei Mario, sondern ist aufgrund der Idee eher als Hintergrund musik zu sehen ... oder h\u00f6hren. Doch ist das der Grund, weshalb sie einem nicht, nicht wie bei Mario, irgendwann penetrant vorkommt, sie ist allerdings recht dominant, und der der ohne Sound spielt, sollte es einfach ganz sein lassen. F\u00fcr mich macht die Musik 50% des Spieles.\n\nBez\u00fcglich des Preises finde ich ist es ein gutes Preis/Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis, da es f\u00fcr mich wiederspiel charakter hat.\nSchlie\u00dflich m\u00f6chte ich bitten, dass diejenigen, die bis hierhin gelesen haben, sich fragen, wozu sie sich \u00dcberhaupt eine von Subjektivit\u00e4t nur \u00fcberflie\u00dfende Rezension durchgelesen haben, doch m\u00f6chte ich diese bitten alles zu vergessen, was ich gesagt habe und dem Spiel eine von mir und anderen Meinung unvoreingenommene Chance zu geben, denn die hat dieses Spiel auf jedenfall verdient. \n\nIch lege es jedem ans Herz ...\nDanke f\u00fcr die Aufmerksamkeit :)", "timestamp_created": 1386003947, "timestamp_updated": 1386003947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7878670": {"recommendationid": "7878670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024276699", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1386304372}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc774\uac83\uc774 \uc9c4\uc9dc \ub9ac\ub4ec\uc561\uc158\uac8c\uc784\uc758 \ub9ac\ub4ec+\uc561\uc158\uc778 \uac8c\uc784! \uc624\ud22c\u3148 \ucc98\ub7fc \ub9ac\ub4ec\uc561\uc158\uac8c\uc784\uc778\ub370 \uc561\uc158\uc740 \ubc25\ub9d0\uc544\uba39\uc740 \uadf8\ub7f0 \uac8c\uc784\uc774 \uc544\ub2d8. \ub178\ub798\ub3c4 \ud6cc\ub96d\ud558\uace0 \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d, \uc778\ud130\ud398\uc774\uc2a4 \ub4f1\ub4f1 \ubaa8\ub4e0\uac83\uc774 \ubbf8\ub2c8\uba40\ub9ac\uc998\uc758 \uadf9\uce58! \uc774\ub807\uac8c \ub2e8\uc21c\ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uadf8 \uc548\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7ac\ubbf8\ub97c \uc774\ub04c\uc5b4 \ub0c8\ub2e4\ub294\uac8c \uc2e0\uae30\ud568. \ud604\uc7ac \uc911\uac04\uc138\uc774\ube0c \uc788\ub294 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 3\uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc9c0\uc758 \uac8c\uc784\ud50c\ub808\uc774\ub9cc \ud574\ub3c4 \uc57d 50\ubd84\uc774 \uac78\ub838\ub294\ub370  \ud558\ub4dc\ub09c\uc774\ub3c4(\uc0ac\uc2e4 \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0 \ub098\uc624\ub294 \uae00\uc790\ub77c\uace0\ub294 140\ubc16\uc5d0 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uadf8\uac83\ub3c4 \uaf64 \ubbf8\ub2c8\uba40\ub9ac\uc998\ub41c \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c.. \uace0\ub85c EX\ubc84\uc804\uc774\ub4e0 \ud558\ub4dc\ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ub4e0 \ub9c8\uc74c\ub300\ub85c \ubd80\ub974\uc790)\uae68\ub294\ub370\ub294 \uc5bc\ub9c8\ub098 \uac78\ub9b4\uae4c! \ubcf4\uc2dc\uae09 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uae4c\uc9c0\ub294 \uc544\ub2c8\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc911\uac04\uc138\uc774\ube0c\uac00 \uc5c6\uc5b4\uc11c \ub3c4\uc800\ud788 \ud560 \uc5c4\ub450\uac00 \uc548\ub098\ub294... \uc5b4\uca0c\ub4e0 \uac8c\uc784 \uc88b\uace0 \ub178\ub798 \uc88b\uace0 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \uc88b\uace0 \ub2e4 \uc88b\uc740 \uadf8\ub7f0 \ub9ac\ub4ec\uc561\uc158\uac8c\uc784!", "timestamp_created": 1385983846, "timestamp_updated": 1385983846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.973510", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7877146": {"recommendationid": "7877146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028031053", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1387930385}, "language": "english", "review": "You really have to follow the beat and listen to the music.

I\u2019ve played quite a few platformers in my time, but this\u2026 this was an experience. In a nutshell, 140 is a very minimalistic platformer set to the rhythm of upbeat electronic music. It is quite challenging at times and requires \u201crhythmic awareness\u201d in order to pass the levels.\n\nGamepaly is where 140 shines. I had a lot of fun with the various platforming mechanics of this game, some of which I\u2019ve never seen before. It\u2019s interesting that your one enemy is this \u201cstatic\u201d and, upon touching it, your immediately reset to your last checkpoint. There was one segment where the static was forming into blocks that the player had to jump on, but, in coordination with the beat of the song playing, these blocks would shrink back to a smaller block. The catch here was that while the block was shrinking or enlarging, it would be static. This mechanic was used effectively in the third level, the last level. I did notice that the last level seemed to ramp up the difficulty quite a bit, compared to the pace that the first two levels were going at. The last boss \u201cbattle\u201d was utterly brutal to complete and required quick acting, or you\u2019d have to restart the fight. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but the difficult should have been panned out better over the three levels of the game, instead of throwing it all into the last level. The game also has another mode, which I was told is \u201chardcore\u201d mode. I played a bit of this mode, not knowing what to expect. Upon death in hardcore mode, I was kicked to the main menu of the game. In order to beat hardcore mode, you\u2019ll have to go through it all without dying. Yep, that sounds hardcore enough for me, a little too hardcore. I was unable to complete hardcore mode and quit after five or six tries. Overall, the gameplay was challenging, unique, and kept me entertained.\n\nThe graphics of 140 might turn a few people away, but I assure you, they fit very well with the gameplay. I\u2019m glad the game was chosen to have this minimalistic style, its been my first exposure to an art style like this. The vibrant colors and the varying shapes of the player sparked my interest in the game to begin with, well, along with the fact that the music was awesome too. When idling, the player remains as a square, when moving, a circle, and, when jumping, a triangle. These shapes fit well with the task that they\u2019re assigned to now that I think about it, square remains flat and is not easily moves, circle can roll, allowing movement, and the triangle allows for easy landing opon a surface. The background seen in the game appears to follow the beat of the music as well, which is quite nice. Overall, minimalistic graphics = win.\n\nThe sound and music in the game was very catchy, working very well with the other aspects of the game. The game even won an IGF award for excellence in audio, which was well-deserved. I believe that the title of the game is also derived from the BPM of the music playing, I found quite interesting. I\u2019m probably going to go looking for the soundtrack after I write this, if it exists. Anyways, the audio was excellent! Nothing much to say about the controls here. I used an Xbox 360 controller during my playthrough. The game has only a few actions: move, jump, and exit. In my case, an analog stick, the A button, and the pause button. Very simple, nothing needing changing here, easy to understand controls.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pN7M00auP0", "timestamp_created": 1385407148, "timestamp_updated": 1387059890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7719662": {"recommendationid": "7719662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042288992", "num_games_owned": 463, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1390552952}, "language": "french", "review": "140 beats par seconde; 140 kiffs par seconde.\nEnfin un jeu qui int\u00e8gre la musique \u00e0 son gameplay. \u00c0 ne pas rater.", "timestamp_created": 1385163816, "timestamp_updated": 1385163816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505566", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7715545": {"recommendationid": "7715545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000987590", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1402677072}, "language": "english", "review": "140 is a very special game.

It's brief, and it's easy, but it is wonderful.\n\n140 is a simple platformer that is almost entirely about executing basic rhythm puzzles.  The levels are alive around you, and as the elements of level design move they create sound, stereo positioned relative to you, that participates in the music.  That music in turn guides you through the game's obstacles which comprise it.\n\nAt the same time, it is an aesthetic delight that plays with color and shape just as much as with sound and rhythm.  There is some replay value in the traditional sense in the form of mirrored versions of the three levels that remove checkpoints, but I would play through the game again anyway just because I like it.\n\nThe entire structural idea of moving past half-spherical ports embedded within the ground, finding an orb, returning to a receptacle, watching the world become washed over by the colors contained in the orb, and seeing that new environmental mechanics have come to life and are contributing to the music is [i]absolutely enchanting[/i] to me. It just captures my imagination so vividly.\n\nThe fact that the orbs emit micro versions of the music that they will add before they have been integrated\u2014and exhibit behavior similar to the level element that will come to life with that sound\u2014makes it even better by providing thematic and logical consistency.\n\nJust one of many things that I love about this gem of a game. \n\nInexpensive and well worth experiencing.

If you\u2019re into deep medi or minimal dubstep, then 140 then definitely check this out. As someone who listens to and mixes a lot of minimal dubstep, I didn\u2019t even have to try to figure out what 140 means. The music basically has a meditative, dark, bassy, and psychedelic feel to it at 140 beats per minute. I highly recommend **subwoofers, quality speakers with great bass**, or quality headphones during gameplay. I always cranked up the volume to really feel the music. \n\n140 really forces you to exercise different parts of your brain simultaneously. That\u2019s what made it tricky yet interesting for me. I had to focus on direction, shape, timing, and sometimes memorization all at once. You basically have to find equilibrium in concentrating on all of those aspects.  However, it is easy to accidentally focus on one thing just a little too much. You\u2019ll see what I mean when you get there. That last segment of the third level almost drove me insane!!! I literally felt like I was going crazy with those rotating arrows. I probably was. I loved and hated it at the same time. It felt psychedelic!\n\n140 was developed by the same designers of Limbo. I sort of had the feeling due to the similar simplicity of the visual design, which I really admire This balances well with the simplicity of sound. 140 is a two-dimensional design comprised of a circle, triangle, square, and rectangle. The developers kept color theory in mind, as different colors or lack of colors went well with the tone of the music. The colors are flat, but chosen in such a way to balance well with the music. \n\n140 is more complex than it appears. The deeper you get into each level, the more rhythmic concentration is required to complete each level.  If you\u2019re musically inclined and have appreciation for minimal dubstep, you\u2019ll probably really enjoy this.\n\nAs you progress through the game, so do the rhythmic sounds. They begin with a simple low frequency samples, then get layered with more beats as you encounter different segments of the levels.  Within these segments, there are various obstacles that animate to the beat of the rhythm.  As the beats layer, so do the obstacles. This really kept me locked in.  \n\nHowever, this is also what made it tricky. As I was feeling the sounds, I had to stay focused. I\u2019ll be playing and sometimes I wanna start dancing or nod my head to the beat. There were times when I had briefly memorize a beat or move in a rhythmic manner to overcome obstacles. This is why I think it\u2019s helpful if you\u2019re musically inclined and/or you pay close attention to the sound of music. The slightest wrong movement can throw you off. So it\u2019s important to really listen and observe what the obstacles are doing and where you\u2019re located. Also pay attention to patterns.\n\nAlso, as someone who gets distracted easily, I really had to force myself to stay concentrated. I actually think this is a great exercise for anyone who wants to improve their focus.\n\nHOWEVER \n\nThink twice before completely exiting the game in the middle of a level (holding ESC). You will only be able to start from the beginning of the level(s) once you completely escape. So if you\u2019re playing Level 2 and you escape in the middle of Level 2, you will have to start at the beginning of Level 2 once you reopen 140. However, it the levels after you surpass each one (there's only 3 levels).  \n\nLuckily, you can continue after your last checkpoint if you didn\u2019t completely escape. \n\nYou also cannot pause. \n\nAs annoying as that was, it kept me playing and forced me not to give up so easily. This has really sharpened my concentration and I hope they release more levels or some kind of addition. \n\nLet me know how it goes if you guys start playing. It's a fair price too.\n", "timestamp_created": 1383859260, "timestamp_updated": 1383859260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.998750", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7581692": {"recommendationid": "7581692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047896499", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1383722472}, "language": "english", "review": "A simply nice platformer with a kickin' electronic soundtrack!", "timestamp_created": 1383721517, "timestamp_updated": 1383721517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7569021": {"recommendationid": "7569021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067627365", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445218889}, "language": "english", "review": "This is by far one of the most challenging indie games I have ever came across.

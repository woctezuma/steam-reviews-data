Und sie ist, wie einige ihrer Vorfahren, psychisch nicht immer ganz stabil. Eines sch\u00f6nen Tages erscheint ihr der Familiengeist, der schon einige aus der Familie in den Wahnsinn getrieben hat und offenbart ihr, da\u00df sie ein Medium sei und ihn nun an den Hacken habe, denn es gilt, anderen Geistern, die in der Zwischenwelt h\u00e4ngengeblieben sind, zu helfen. Nicht gerade rosige Aussichten f\u00fcr Rosa.\n\nDer vierte Teil setzt erz\u00e4hlerisch, nachdem ein Erz\u00e4hlstrang in den ersten drei Teilen abgeschlossen wurde, nochmal frisch an. Dennoch ist es ratsam, erst die Vorg\u00e4nger zu spielen. Allein schon deshalb, weil man sonst einige ironischen Spitzen und Anspielungen verpa\u00dft. Man hat weitaus mehr vom Spielerlebnis, wenn man die Figuren schon mit all ihren Macken liebgewonnen hat.\n\nDie neuen F\u00e4lle sind spannend, durchaus abwechslungsreich und unterhaltsam. Dabei ist dieser vierte Teil auch etwas umfangreicher als der vorige, wenn er auch als Episodenadventure kein Umfangmonster sein kann. \n\nAuch nett, da\u00df f\u00fcr unseren Haus- und Hofgeist eine neue Mechanik eingebaut wurde und da\u00df wir inzwischen \u00fcber das Handy im spielinternen Netz recherchieren k\u00f6nnen und nicht jedesmal nach hause zum PC latschen m\u00fcssen.\n\nDas Gameplay ist ganz typisches Point-and-Click. Auf Screens begutachten wir Gegenst\u00e4nde, sammeln sie auf und packen sie in unser Inventar und reden vor allem mit allen m\u00f6glichen und unm\u00f6glichen NPCs. Dabei funktioniert das Game im Kern wie eine Detektivgeschichte. Hierf\u00fcr haben wir unser Notizbuch, in dem wir einzelne Hinweise miteinander kombinieren k\u00f6nnen und so zu neuen Schlu\u00dffolgerungen gelangen k\u00f6nnen. \n\nDie recht lineare Geschichte entfaltet sich dramaturgisch sinnvoll und gekonnt und bleibt durch liebenswerte oder nervige Charakterzeichnungen stets spannend. Erstaunlich, da\u00df das Spiel einen schmalen Grad zwischen Ironie und Ernst so zielsicher trifft. Mit Witz und Sarkasmus werden auch sehr ernste und bittere Themen behandelt, ohne, da\u00df sich das Spiel je l\u00e4cherlich \u00fcber diese Themen macht.  \n\nDie Grafik und Stilistik erinnert entfernt an alte LucasArts Titel. Alles ist bewu\u00dft pixelig, reduziert und retro. Dadurch entsteht ein nostalgischer Charme, der viel zum Spielspa\u00df beitr\u00e4gt, allerdings auch dazu f\u00fchrt, da\u00df man das Spiel am besten in einem kleinen Fenster zockt. Die (englische) Synchronisation ist gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils stark, die Charaktere sind teils durchaus patzig und \u00fcbelgelaunt und die Sprecher treffen die einzelnen Haltungen ad\u00e4quat. Endlich einmal wurde auch die Aufnahme der guten Sprecher einigerma\u00dfen professionell gemacht. Die drei\u00dfig Ocken f\u00fcr einen Pop-schutz scheinen durch den Verkauf der Vorg\u00e4nger zusammengekommen zu sein. \n\nEin Kritikpunkt mag die L\u00e4nge des Spiels sein. In nur zwei Stunden kann man durch sein. Allerdings waren die Blackwell-Spiele stets als Spieleserie ausgelegt und so kann man die verschiedenen Blackwell-Titel auch insgesamt als ein gro\u00dfes Episoden-Adventure verstehen.\n\nTolle Figuren, intelligente Geschichte, viel Witz, ohne albern zu sein. Ein ohne Frage empfehlenswertes kleines Spiel der alten Schule.\n\nTechnischer Tip: Wer beim Starten einen Blackscreen hat, einfach in den Startoptionen \"--setup\" eintragen und dann im Setup den Grafiktreiber \u00e4ndern.\n\n[h1]Wertung:[/h1]\n8/10 Atmosph\u00e4re\n8/10 Story\n7/10 Grafik\n8/10 Sound\n7/10 Spielmechanik\n8/10 Balancing\n8/10 Spielspass\n\n[h1]Fazit:[/h1]\nDer vierte Streich gef\u00e4llt sogleich.\n\n[h1][b]8/10 Gesamtwertung", "timestamp_created": 1513892804, "timestamp_updated": 1513893197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657477", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38466080": {"recommendationid": "38466080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006555541", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479048833}, "language": "english", "review": "great game and is on my top 3 of  point and click genre games , verry well executed in acting/storry/puzzles", "timestamp_created": 1513800013, "timestamp_updated": 1513800013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34812124": {"recommendationid": "34812124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009301811", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504190667}, "language": "english", "review": "Blackwell Deception finally kicks it production quality up to the level the series deserves. Audio and art are significantly improved and the story preps for a grand finale. To spoil the review, it is a great game.\n\nIn the previous three games in the series, Joey\u2019s voice actor sounded like he was speaking into a tin can.  It was the biggest glaring flaw in an otherwise great series.  No more, Joey\u2019s voice is now clear and audible. No more issues with weird audio, everything, even background music, comes through clearly. Voicing acting issues are somewhat diminished with characterization that is now more suitable for the actors. Yes, it is kind of like nailing the hammer, but it works.\n\nStory plotting continues to improve as well.  We are not just randomly running into characters that lead to a case, every interaction is purposeful. Theming is well founded as the story now relates lost souls to people trying to find themselves.  Moreover, the lore and mythos in the game builds further without overwhelming the story too much.  Sidekick Joey takes on an even larger role than before and is not just a source of sardonic whit.  His character\u2019s past is hinted at but the details are not overworked, you understand the character with just few lines and that\u2019s enough.  Previously, Rosangela was motivated by threat of insanity, now the story has developed in a way to motivate and give her a personal interest in the cases. She no longer feels like someone you are dragging along, but takes on a proper protagonist role.\n\nOverall, there are no longer any outstanding flaws requiring justification for a recommendation.  The games formula works and is well written and produced.  At this point, the only reason a point and click adventure fan should not play this game is because they still need to play the previous games in the series.\n", "timestamp_created": 1504868972, "timestamp_updated": 1504868972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34807772": {"recommendationid": "34807772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042587716", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 950, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465176074}, "language": "english", "review": "really enjoyed all the blackwell games. great experience.", "timestamp_created": 1504844926, "timestamp_updated": 1504844926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34606257": {"recommendationid": "34606257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262417503", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498664283}, "language": "english", "review": "Liked the game, nice art, story atmosphere.

However, the games don't suffer from one flaw that exists in many quests, and that is excessive use of items. In some quest games you usually stack up a lot of items and end up trying every combination of item and something clickable on the screen until you find that absurd combination that makes you progress. The Blackwell series doesn't have that flaw as items aren't the main part of the game. Also, when places become irrelevant you can't access them anymore, which also prevents having to go back and try to find something useful in every place that you've been through at the endgame.\n\nThe progression in the game is made by combining the abilities of Rosa (or Lauren in Blackwell Unbound) and Joey, which complete each other. Joey can enter locked rooms but cannot interact with anything, and Rosa can do the opposite. Only by combining their abilities you will make progress. There's also a built in search engine inside a game in which you have to use in order to progress, which makes you feel that you're doing detective work and not just trying to figure out how to use your inventory.\n\nThe plot becomes \"bigger\" in each episode and ends with a grand finale in Blackwell Epiphany, so you don't feel like you're doing that same thing in each game.\n\nI really enjoyed the series and I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1500017096, "timestamp_updated": 1500017096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33471012": {"recommendationid": "33471012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094735875", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499746795}, "language": "english", "review": "This whole series is great!

En esta entrega las piezas empiezan a encajar y nuevas fuerzas entran en escena y ponen en evidencia que esto va de algo m\u00e1s profundo que simplemente ir por ah\u00ed salvando esp\u00edritus. \n\nDesde luego, con esta entrega han terminado de ganarme y a partir de ahora estar\u00e9 muy pendiente a las aventuras que desarrollan o editan los chicos de Wadjet Eye Games. \n\nEn definitiva un gran juego y un gran capitulo que eleva por si solo la calidad que ya ten\u00eda toda la saga. Totalmente imprescindible para todo jugador con independencia de sexo y pelaje. Recomendado incluso si no se ha jugado antes a ning\u00fan cap\u00edtulo de la saga Blackwell... si se juega este cap\u00edtulo uno acabara enganchado irremediablemente a toda la saga. \n\n\u00bf A que esperas aventurero ?.\n\n\n8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1493547797, "timestamp_updated": 1504353415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599900", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31385261": {"recommendationid": "31385261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165692237", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493253142}, "language": "polish", "review": "No i mam problem z t\u0105 cz\u0119\u015bci\u0105 serii.

You won't regret it.\n\nThese games were a VERY pleasant surprise and this is both the best and longest of the series up through the fourth (though I recommend playing them in order, because there are continuing elements). The first four games had been sitting in my Steam collection for a couple of years before the urge to play an early-90s-style adventure game came over me, but when it did these games satisfied that urge almost perfectly. They're designed according to the rules that Ron Gilbert and other designers worked out at LucasArts in the late 80s -- you can't die, you can't find yourself in an unwinnable position -- as opposed to the inexplicably popular Sierra adventure games, where you could die from simply examining an object and frequently needed to restore to old saved games to pick up an object you needed. (The Sierra games improved with the Gabriel Knight series.) The puzzles in The Blackwell Deception are challenging but generally fair, though occasionally you need to stumble around until you accidentally find a solution. At least the solutions tend to make sense in retrospect and you probably could solve almost all of them with a lot of thought if you have the patience. The main characters, a medium and her wiseass spirit guide, are charming and the voice acting is top notch. In fact, these are the only games I've seen that not only credit the voice actors at the end but show pictures of each actor next to a picture of the character they played, so you'll want to stay for the credits. This will take several hours to play and you'll feel you got your money's worth, especially with the way prices have dropped.

The partner switching dynamic is also strong, as are the different locales.\n\nWeak points are one voice actor in particular, some minor bugging with the partner switch hotkey, and the dropdown inventory. And a personal critique of mine, the \"internet search\" option, while not too much of an issue, may serve as a point of contention, as players may get frustrating not knowing what to search for and what not to.\n\nOverall, this has piqued my interest for Epiphany, and has brought my lukewarm opinion of the series to a considerable simmer.", "timestamp_created": 1473033555, "timestamp_updated": 1473033555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25296527": {"recommendationid": "25296527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009810921", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 111, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471969725}, "language": "english", "review": "The fourth installment of the Blackwell series stumbles a bit visually. A new pixel artist was chosen for this game, so the slowly improving character designs have taken a few steps back. This issue is usually easy to ignore thanks to the much more attractive character portraits and the series' general aesthetic of leaning more on its sound than its visuals. Finer details, however, can be downright inscrutable which adds unnecessary difficulty in a genre that relies on a close examination of one's surroundings. Confusing graphics don't result in impassable obstacles though as anything that can be interacted with does have its own hover text.\nThankfully, the mechanics of this game have continued the pattern of the refinement of the past three games. Physically combining clues to come to new conclusions has returned from its absence in Convergence and has been moved to Rosangela's new smartphone. Additionally the smartphone has taken over the email and web search functions, which not only streamlines a process previously marked by constant location hopping, but also gives our modern heroine and her older spirit guide something to banter over. Convergence may have seen Rosa and Joey starting to get along, but by Deception the two have really hit their stride together. They seem more like partners now as opposed to the unwilling allies they were before.\nDeception stands on its own better than the previous three games.

(I have not played the last game yet, however.) Everything about the design and style feels right. It is more streamlined, more visually stunning, and almost twice as long as any of the previous games. It advances the main storyline of the game, although after a long detour, and the storytelling is more action-packed and compelling than before. All of the side-characters have meaningful and complex backstories that the player can sympathize with, and the open-ended nature of your investigations (since you can complete the cases in any order you prefer) makes the game feel bigger than it actually is. Even the last act of the game is very satistfying.\n\nThe voice-acting is more professional than before, although the writing still suffers from occasionally low-quality and cheesy dialogue. The soundtrack, too, follows the high bar set by the composer across the previous three entries. \n\nOverall, there is very little to complain about, aside from the occasional adventure game clich\u00e9s and frustrations. (The in-game hint system, which certainly is a requisite in any self-conscious adventure game, is mostly good, but sadly unreliable at points.) Almost everything else, from the gameplay to the story, just flows very smoothly, and is a pleasure to play though (AND a second time with the commentary track turned on.)

I forget which one, but recall it being male I think. And Madeline's voice and manner of speaking are also entirely different compared to the previous episode ([i]Convergence[/i]). Here she's way too \"casual\" and not regal enough. I was very disappointed by whoever voiced her here.\n    [*][b][u]Music gets too grating[/u][/b] - There are too many consecutive scenes with overpowering music. My ears got really tired and I longed for silence, or at least white noise. Music should be interspersed with ambiematic sound; it shouldn't be music for every single scene all the way. The audio environment in the opening case, for instance, was done very well.\n    [*][b][u]Audio can't be adjusted properly[/u][/b] - There are 2 controls for sound: 1 for \"audio\" and the other for \"voice\". Bringing down the volume for \"audio\" brings down the volume for \"voice\" as well, so if you just want to turn down the music but leave the voice at the same volume, you can't! How pointless is that!\n    [*][b][u]Less game detail[/u][/b] - Compared to previous episodes in the Blackwell series, this one is rather lacking in stuff like easter eggs and \"extras\". For instance, in previous games, if you had done in-game \"Oogle\" searches, you'd be able to search for characters and events from the previous games. Now, the in-game Internet search is really bare bones, and only provides you enough content to successfully complete the game. Even searching for other in-game characters yields nothing.\n    [*][b][u]Worse graphics[/u][/b] - Must say I wasn't too impressed with the way the starting scene looked. Somehow, the graphics from previous Blackwell episodes was much better. \n    [*][b][u]Less animation[/u][/b] - Unlike before, characters' faces no longer move when they speak.\n    [*][b][u]No \"extras\"?[/u][/b] - In previous games, you could get a password upon game completion, allowing you to access extra content like bloopers, concept art, etc. I couldn't find that anywhere here.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nQuite a must-play for Blackwell fans.

Doing so they encounter a number of persons/ghosts who play an important role in the story later on.\n\nJoey is a ghost himself so he can reach places that Rosangela cannot, but he cannot wander off too far because he is bound to Rosangela. He also cannot touch anything so he needs Rosangela for this. This poses some interesting situations in which Joey needs to get Rosangela into locked rooms/buildings.\n\nA very interesting game mechanic is that you have to cross-reference pieces of information.

The reason being the games were both very similar in nature. As I stated before, the Blackwell Series is an interesting one and as each game progresses, the storyline becomes more and more polished, the art gets better and better, and the puzzles and clue finding get more interesting. In the fourth installment holds true to Unbound and Convergence, but its real strength comes from the best puzzles of the four games. Here are some of the pro's and con's of the game.\n\nPro's: The storyline is evolving into a rather interesting and mysterious one. Rosa and Joeys relationship is fully developed by this point and is quite hilarious. Many more puzzles than the other games and a bit more involved than just left click this object and see what Rosa/Joey will do. I also enjoyed the music and the length much more in this game from the the first two games, it was comparible to the third installment.\n\nCon's: I still hate the art. It is definitely not my style and they just keep changing it from game to game. Consistancy please! And the consistancy between the games is also a little headache. But most of the changes seem to enhance the new game and make you wish they did it with the previous games (Potential Spoilers but not too much: I loved when they allowed the swapping).\n\nI've yet to play Epiphany, but here are my scores of the games.\n\nBlackwell Legacy: 6/10\nBlackwell Unbound: 8/10\nBlackwell Convergence: 7.6/10\nBlackwell Deception: 8.2/10\n\nBlackwell Series: 7.8/10\n\nCheck out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!", "timestamp_created": 1450600258, "timestamp_updated": 1450600258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504337", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19403148": {"recommendationid": "19403148", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976641472", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403808464}, "language": "english", "review": "Point/Click Adventure games are such a dieing breed now.

We have a case, a mystery and a villain. All is set to pursue the next chapter of the Legacy! The game serves as the triumphant raise of suspense for Rosa's future and a vague epilogue for Joey's ominous background. So far, this is the best game of the whole Blackwell series.\n\nFollowing the events of [i]the Blackwell Convergence[/i], Rosa and Joey keep doing what they do best; now in a professional context. Our little girl has business cards and all: Rosangela Blackwell, Spiritual Consultant. They do not pace the streets of New York in hopes of finding a case anymore. The case comes and finds them, alongside the trouble attached, of course. Following their recent fiasco - and a particularly unlucky trip to New Jersey - Rosa receives a phone call from an old colleague she had, - back from when she was working for The Village Eye - Jeremy Sams. Apparently, Jeremy now works for The City Post as a reporter and needs Rosa's assistance to either make or break the case he's been working on. Unbeknownst to her, Rosa shall uncover a truth so grim, nothing will ever be the same. Not for her, not for Joey... not anymore.\n\nI recall describing the previous games with certain genres in my review for [i]the Blackwell Convergence[/i]. I'd like to keep my tradition and describe [i]the Blackwell Deception[/i] as the season finale for your favorite TV series. It drives you to the point that you bite on your fingers, expecting for the grand climax you are about to face, then... you realize that there shall be a next season for your questions to be answered, so you are left high and dry, craving for more! The aspects of Rosa's ability, the so-far carefully shrouded past of Joey, their omnipresent yet mysterious bond, the subtext of Madeleine's intentions, the nature of our former villain, the Countess' madness, the presence of a cult tangled with supernatural forces: they are all scattered as bird crumbs for you to follow!\n\nOur already familiar characters now completed their evolution and possess full-fledged personalities. Rosa is strong, real and persistent. She takes shots, makes calls and chases leads just like old Lauren Blackwell did. As a completely differentiating factor, she never dismisses the contents of her own heart. Nothing would make Miss Blackwell a people's person, but Rosa is still a humanitarian. When someone she cares is hurt, it gets personal. Joey, on the other hand, seems more than an omnipresent source of sarcasm and displeasure now. He cares not only for Rosa, but for many others and tries to suppress the haunting voice of his own consciousness to take the next step ahead. He gets involved in Rosa's life aside from their business, more than ever.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, this game is the combination of all others so far. Combining clues interface is back - with Rosa's phone becoming handier - and puzzles get a bit more item oriented. With some attention to environment and some key words that people keep mentioning, you'll flow through the game. Dialogue puzzles are my favorites to tell the truth, making the people that they work on lively, real and deep. This is also the game that you use Joey to his full potential, more interactively alongside Rosa. Commentary and bloopers are joyful options that we anticipate now. Graphics are also at their best display possible for the given art style. The art used for the Void between worlds keeps getting more beautiful in each game, I wonder what Dave Gilbert's team will come up with for the last installment.\n\nAm I creating suspense, or not? Well, this is the whole idea. This whole game is present to create the suspense needed for the last chapter of the series. Countless mysteries are coming to explanation with only the biggest of questions persist, to prepare you to the last big step: [i]the Blackwell Epiphany[/i], the last installment of the remarkable Blackwell series.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_created": 1440456951, "timestamp_updated": 1457115397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.762727", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17659774": {"recommendationid": "17659774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001260319", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440243554}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Cuarto episodio de la serie Blackwell (tras The Blackwell Legacy, Blackwell Unbound y The Blackwell Convergence), de un total de cinco.

Evidentemente BD si pu\u00f2 giocare tranquillamente isolata dagli episodi precedenti, ma si perderano i riferimenti al passato e non si capir\u00e0 a fondo la storia dei protagonisti, Rosangela e Joey, anche se nell'introduzione il gioco introduce lo strano connubio tra i due e fa capire qual \u00e8 il 'mestiere' di lei. Gli enigmi non sono da principianti. Il sonoro \u00e8 buono, tipo bistr\u00f2 e pianoforte anni '30. I dialoghi sono frizzanti, ma tutto il gioco \u00e8 solo nella lingua inglese, e questo non permetter\u00e0 di capire a fondo molte sottigliezze e sfumature delle battute Molto probabilmente manca quel qualcosa che ti buchi dentro, anche se, in verit\u00e0, un po' di commozione mi \u00e8 venuta a vedere [spoiler] giovani ragazze assassinate, accompagnate alla fine del loro cammino, quando ancora erano nel pieno delle loro speranze e della loro voglia di divertirsi, come la ragazza che vuole ballare e che con trasporto si abbandona ad un bacio liberatore verso Joey [/spoiler].

The backgrounds go from hand drawn pixel art to 3d renders, which makes the game look a bit dreary compared to the third game. On a positive note the walking and movement animations are still done in 2d, and improve dramatically. Movement finally looks smooth. The resolution for the UI and text are doubled, and the general feel of the game is much slicker than earlier entries.\n\nThe story continues in a similar style to earlier entries, which makes it feel formulaic. Not bad or anything, it just starts to make sense why it\u2019s the second to last entry. You couldn\u2019t do this for much longer without eroding the goodwill of the audience. As it is, the series is of an appropriate length. \n\nThe puzzles go for a higher level of difficulty here than earlier entries, and unfortunately I didn\u2019t like many of them. When puzzles hit a certain level of time investment, I feel they distance me from the characters and the story. It becomes more of an abstract puzzle solving game than a story. I only felt this to a mild degree, mostly just in comparison to the first three games. I was still enjoying myself, still itching to see what happens next. But just in the distance I could hear it, the voice in my head saying \u201cwhy am I doing this, what is my life, what\u2019s the point\u201d.

Le pass\u00e9 de Joey ressurgit un peu mais cet aspect de l'histoire est laiss\u00e9 de c\u00f4t\u00e9, un peu dommage, peut-\u00eatre pour le dernier \u00e9pisode ? \n\nLe syst\u00e8me de mise en relation des indices qui avait disparu dans Blackwell Convergence r\u00e9apparait mais ne sert que tr\u00e8s peu \u00e0 faire des d\u00e9ductions. Comme dans le jeu pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent Joey est aussi l\u00e0 pour donner des indices si on est coinc\u00e9s, ce qui est pas mal car il a quelques moment o\u00f9 on va tourner en rond sans savoir ce qu'on a manqu\u00e9.\n\nGlobalement les m\u00e9canismes de jeu sont donc les m\u00eames, les changement sont vraiment minimes. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=459807143 On retrouve aussi le mode avec commentaires des d\u00e9veloppeurs si on d\u00e9sire en savoir plus sur la conception du jeu, \u00e0 faire lors d'une seconde partie de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\n\nCe jeu \u00e9tait vraiment bon et compar\u00e9 au premier Blackwell les histoires sont bien plus \u00e9labor\u00e9es, m\u00eame si parfois cela implique un peu de confusion on arrive toujours \u00e0 comprendre le sc\u00e9nario au final. J'aime aussi le fait qu'il y ait toujours des clins d\u2019\u0153ils aux \u00e9pisodes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents ainsi qu'un lien entre chaque jeu, m\u00eame infime.

This was also the first of the series that I played. While it was the fourth of five I felt as though I was stepping into a good novel in a series as opposed to a chapter in a book. A few characters came in and were introduced as having had a history in past games, but the references were well explained and kept someone jumping in to a game they'd bought in a bundle deal from feeling lost and confused, but rather wanting to explore this history. \n\nThis game has several things going for it but the biggest selling point is the story. The story is outstanding. The characters are well crafted, witty and charming. The plot helps the player easily suspend disbelief. The dialogue all reads as natural. If this were a book I would call it a page turner. As it is, I beat the game in a single sitting. I can barely do anything in a single sitting including sitting. I was kept enraptured by the plot and story. Even when the developers quests began to feel a bit like filler until the final climax (which all games do to some extent or another, particularly those that boast hundreds of hours of gameplay) a new clue to the ultimate villainy was revealed, or some new mysterious and extenuating circumstance would pop up making the pseudo-repetitive task feel important and invigorating the story in a way that I didn't really notice until I was looking back on it.  The overall noir feel to the game and sly tributes to the hardboiled and noir era of film and literature jive perfectly with the stories. Where much modern noir feels forced, especially in some indie games, here it felt right at home and that certain brand of wit was turned against the genre at times for comedic effect. \n\nThis game is well made even though graphically it is almost always charming. The retro pixelated style is at times beautiful but more often some of the details of the background felt a bit lacking. For a small team putting out games in this series every other year, however, this is a forgivable lack and, as I said, it's focus is on the excellent story.

Fans of the story will love to hear that a lot of loose threads from previous Blackwell games start coming together in an awesome way in this installment. \"Everything is connected\" indeed! The conclusion to this one is rather unexpected and leaves you with that great feeling that the story you're partaking in is every bit as good as tv or film.\n\nAs much as I have to praise the great-as-usual story in this installment, I unfortunately have to dock this one a few points in the puzzles department. In the previous Blackwell games, the solutions to puzzles have always for the most part made perfect sense, and you could arrive at the solutions very logically. Deception is the first installment in the Blackwell series where I have felt that some of the solutions to the puzzles involve doing things that you are very unlikely to think of doing... or doing things that past experience has taught you would never work (e.g. what you can and cannot do with the neck tie) or involve factoring in a piece of information that has never mattered in a Blackwell game before and so it doesn't even register as something you should pay attention to (e.g. in ONE case and ONE case only, you need to notice what time of day it appears to be based on the sun in the sky when looking at the map menu... I mean, COME ON. It's a menu, and there is ZERO precedent for that and it never comes up again.)\n\nBasically, some of the solutions in Deception rely not only on the information you've uncovered while investigating (as is usually the case in Blackwell) and instead throw in some some one-off, special case thing that adds a sort of secret hitch to uncovering the next lead. And actually, there is one puzzle in the game where you have to perform a set of actions in a particular sequence, but if you do it in the WRONG sequence on your first try, then the puzzle is completely unsolvable.... there IS a way to reset it by talking to a character at a completely different location, but you have no way of knowing that, so if it happens to you, it is extremely confusing.\n\nAnyway, I don't want to harp on about it too long. Suffice to say, I thought the puzzles were a little more flawed than usual in this installment, but still an excellent game, and the story was as good as ever.", "timestamp_created": 1430697892, "timestamp_updated": 1430702301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15640438": {"recommendationid": "15640438", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968300492", "num_games_owned": 609, "num_reviews": 211, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429115115}, "language": "english", "review": "Blackwell Deception continues to show improvements to a pretty fun adventure series.\n\n+ More art changes, the game looks pretty good\n+ The story is better than the previous entries, not that the previous ones have disappointed me\n+ Voice acting has gotten much better (or I've just gotten use to it)\n+ Cellphone!\n\n- Steam overlay still causes the game to soft lock and/or crash.\n\nPlaytime: ~ 4h\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1430501319, "timestamp_updated": 1430501319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15588882": {"recommendationid": "15588882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156003940", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430521350}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great so far and the gameplay has been tightened up way more and the features are updated.", "timestamp_created": 1430173461, "timestamp_updated": 1430173461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15402678": {"recommendationid": "15402678", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043782587", "num_games_owned": 1439, "num_reviews": 386, "playtime_forever": 820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429183158}, "language": "english", "review": "Blackwell Deception is the Blackwell series game number four, still being a point-n-click adventure of modern approach. It finally figured best approach to all puzzle mechanics in Blackwell series and the plot started to get onto next, bigger level.\n\nThis time around engine supports widescreen, with art being designed around it. It still will freak out when you press Shift+Tab, but pressing Tab key always fixes it anyway.\n\nWhile having nice pixel-art, it's still a modern take on adventure game, which means no deaths or dead ends. Inventory isn't as heavily used. The puzzles mostly make sense, no complete nonsence that old games are loved for, I guess. So, as said, this part finally figured out how to implent all gameplay features of Blackwell for the best. You got notebook and smart phone. Once again, after taking it out in Converenge, you can use notebook to combine clues, which is mostly used so you could do a better search in Internet on your Smartphone. Yes, unlike Converenge, you don't have to come to same place, that is Rose's home, to search. Yes, you can search and type things there too. Great ideas. Makes it feel more like investigation.\n\nOnce again the style of pixel-art changed. This time it feels a little not as good as in Converenge, artist was learning. A bit of comic and realistical styles were mixed, title screen being most noticeable. They say that at first release it had character icons done in complete non-pixelish comic, until it was made pixel-artish again in later update. Anyway, character face icons aren't animated anymore. Still show varied expressions.\nCharacters sprites and movement for some reason make me think of older stuff, like gameboy, especially main hero's walking animation, which looks like she is sliding legs over floor. Just not as polished as in the third game. No more animation for But nope, it's still great, just nitpicking. Yes, it is great. It has a night time setting this time around, mostly.\n\nSoundtrack is half and half. Literally. When it comes to normal or relaxish areas, it reuses Converenge soundtrack of a bit of jazzyness and such. While for a darker and ambient scenes, as well as emotional, it uses it's own kind of music, somewhere jazz, somewhere more of technoish. Not bad, but still not too memoriable. Though some scenes are quite affecting wtih such soundtrack.\n\nAs for plot, we still have Rose and Joey, spirit guide, searching and saving ghosts. Though she decided to get more public, so people could call her anyday, it didn't really improve her life or reputation much, just getting in even more troubles. Storyline seems to be bigger and more interesting, getting hinted at Joey's backstory. It also gets darker, more emotional. You even once again get to handle two cases of ghosts in same time, like it was in Unbound. At the end of a game you will even be hinted at what direction the series will take next and what kind of villians you will have to take down... Spolier: Nope, it didn't take that direction, don't expect it.\n\nOnce again a game comes with commentary mode. And it got improved for once. Instead of being randomly interrupted, each scene will have a buttons somewhere on the side, each with their own first letter, in which you can tell away which one is a voice acting blooper or a developer commentary. Much better. Though developer still think that everybody cares about voice acting a lot more. But it still got interesting stuff about game design.\n\nSo, overall, the finest Blackwell game, which finally set the formula for the best. You should should play previous titles.

I'm glad to finally be able to recommend something from this series-- just wish it didn't take 3 previous flops to get to this point.\n\nAdding more artists to the repertoire definitely paid off. The change in visual style for the 4th installment in this series is refreshing; all my previous gripes with the art (rough animation, bad perspective/pixelation, flat atmosphere) have all been fixed-- and beautifully. The art/animation in 'Deception' is tight, stylish, and consistent.\n\nThe upgrades on sound (FINALLY; a pop filter! ...and proper mixing!) are fantastic. Gameplay is more refined & intuitive; a nicely updated GUI with more preference controls has been added-- even the writing & dialogue/timing are more solid and entertaining. \n\nNewcomers, grab this one! If you're curious about the earlier games, I can only suggest buying the 4-pack Blackwell bundle if Steam offers it on sale again-- otherwise, you're better off watching a \"let's play\" of the the first three chapters. \n\nThere are multiple references to previous storylines that may otherwise be lost on the unfamiliar in 'Deception'-- but all in all, it stands alone as a fun & original supernatural mystery that any adventure gamer can enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1415695593, "timestamp_updated": 1415697284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510050", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12852900": {"recommendationid": "12852900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110861635", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1415466046}, "language": "english", "review": "My personal score 8/10.\n\nHere we have another game in Blackwell series.

But it managed to pleasantly surprise me.\nIt doesn't veer into fan-fiction territory like Convergence. The notes system returns, and while there's not as much \"cross reference\" gameplay as I would have liked, it does a good job of tracking information. It doesn't list every relevant issue, so you'll still be requiered to keep notes of your own for the ocasional memory puzzle and in-game word search.\nUtilizing Joey's ghostly powers in puzzles is a bit more prominent then in previous games. And the creative use of his limited abilities fules a few of the best puzzles in the game.\nThe Blackwell series does a good job of presenting small mysteries with a cast of rounded characters, and Deception is no exception. The three incidents you investigate are engaging and the characters you interact with feel like they have some depth beyond providing obstacles or clues. They didn'y feel as fleshed out as in previous games, but dialog is still the main arsenal in investigations.\nThe metaphysical aspect is the weak part of the series, in my opinion. But Deception manages to handle it better then all the other entries. Some of the backstory from previous games gets a broader significance at last. And there's a bit of intriguing refrences to the implication of the metaphysical on the world.\nThe villain is again pretty weak. It's better then the last two games where \"I'm just crazy\" was the main motivation of the antagonist, but it is still a weak villain.\n\nAs I see it, the Blackwell's series achiles hill is it's over-reliance on tropes. The whole \"releasing ghosts from the mortal plane by resolving their earthly affairs\" and \"new york gangster lingo\" really come off as clishe'.

Another long night, staying up and trying to solve it. Now, I played I've played the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and now the 4th game  was amazing but  just a bit annnoyed with a few things and leaving me dissapointed in some others. Doesn't mean I didn't find great things about the game as well. First off, how Rosa looked. From the side, she looked like a kids drawing. How she was designed made it seem like not enough time was spent on her look unlike the other games. That goes for Joey as well, but just a little bit less. Joey is another thing though. In all past three games, when you were Joey, you could never leave until Rosa or Laran did. In this one, you could and that made it out of character and confusing because sometimes I would leave as Joey and forget that I left as him in that small amount of time, go somewhere new and when I got there to go talk to someone, I found that I couldn't as I was still Joey. It was annoying as well as how the commentary and bloopers were placed. I noticed that when your on the boat and you progess further on the boat, you notice new bloopers and commentary pop up. What if that happened somewhere else and you missed something, making you spend countless minutes to hours looking and making sure. I believe it was better the way it was in the last three games. There still was and is alot of great things in this game. The story line and plot was amazingly well written. With every turn and progression, you're hooked onto more the story as it is given, keeping you in your seat and wanting to know more of the story line and plot. The art work was beautiful and I still give a hand to Dave Gilbert for wanting to use actual sights in New York in his games. I don't believe they would be the same without them. The end though was the best. A warning. A warning that made me want to continue on (as  if I needed it anyway) and discover what the next game had instore for me. Following after, was the music. Beautiful work. Couldn't have done better myself (even though I don't know how to play anything). Now, as for the game and playing it. Even though it has a few faults of its own (like every other game in the world), it is still an amazing game with beautiful artwork, wonderful music, and a storyline that will have you on the edge of your seat, wanting more.

I have reeeeeally mixed feelings about this game. If I was thrown by the change in art quality from Legacy to Convergence (ignoring Unbound as \"retro\" style), then Deception was a kick off of a tall building onto a bed of spikes. I get that Wadjet Eye is a small publisher with a budget--and they've done exceptionally good work on that budget--but the style changes just within any one of the Blackwell games is at its most difficult to look past in Deception. Only part of it is the more photorealistic dialogue portraits compared to the low-res of the character sprites [and, in particular, to the carryover photos from Legacy, especially], but I had a particularly difficult time with Joey's more gaunt look in Deception, especially since he now happens to look quite a bit like an ex of mine =p But Rosa's sprite... Sorry, it barely even looks like she's supposed to be female. Her face just looks like some kind of misshapen blob, while her portrait looks gorgeous. I had the worst time managing my suspension of disbelief trying to associate the two as being the same character.\n\nOther than those art issues, Deception is a great game! The writing is top-notch, though there were a few walkthrough-worthy points just because I couldn't figure out what would trigger the appropriate dialogue option. About my only solid complaint with the writing is the \"middle of a series\"-ness, but I suppose that's inevitable in a series with recurring characters.

(Excluding Lauren's game because she's #1). \n\nLike the others in the series this game was a very logical progression in story from the other games and brought new mechanics, but was also different because we no longer had the villain from the previous two and the introduction of something \"bigger\" (potential games on the way to explore this thread?). But, just like the other games, the spiritual overtones and existential themes are most overpowering in this game and I can't say I liked that.

Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nAdditional note: This review will be shorter and will be written in respect to the first and second in the series (Blackwell Legacy and Blackwell Unbound), since this is an episodic sort of series.\n\nGameplay: This game kinda reverts to the puzzle design that I'm not so much a fan of that I've talked about in past reviews. That's not to say that they didn't make sense, but I do question the viability of some of them (for example, the key puzzle; I'd have a bit of a hard time believing that a key can fit so easily under the door). This time around, there's dialogue puzzles; a puzzle variety I'm not so much a fan of as oftentimes it comes down to running the same conversation loop over and over until you get the right answer. I didn't really feel accomplished/clever after figuring out the puzzles; I just felt like I would be done rubbing items together for a little bit. That may just be me, but I still stand by what I say in that puzzles just aren't fun in point-and-click adventure games. 6/10.\n\nStory: A bit of a disappointment coming from Convergence. I dunno; this story didn't have the same spark of intrigue that Convergence did. The first half of the game is same old, same old, but the second half does manage to catch a few embers. These few embers aren't enough to create a fire, though. 7/10.\n\nGraphics: Yup, another art style change. As I said in the Convergence review, the same artist worked on Deception and Epiphany, so once I get around to that game, I finally won't be able to talk about that aspect. They've gone for a more realistic style this time, which honestly works best for the game in my opinion. Convergence's comic style was nice and all, but a realistic style does seem like it works better. 4/5.\n\nSound: There weren't really any standout tracks in this one. The soundtrack is still quite good, but it's more of a uniform good. More emphasis was put on ambient sounds this time around. Again, the VAs have good recordings and again they did a good job with it. Even if I did want to punch a few characters in the throat because of their voices and the way they talked. But hey, if they're making me have any emotion, that's a job well done. 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 6/7/4/4; cumulative score of 7.0/10. If it weren't for the second half, I'd say that you don't need to play this game at all. However, the ending to the game is a not so subtle lead-in to what's probably gonna go down in the finale. I said in the last review that I probably wouldn't be able to wait the week on average I give myself between these games, but I think I will be able to do that between this and Epiphany.", "timestamp_created": 1403565805, "timestamp_updated": 1403565805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10668154": {"recommendationid": "10668154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049760414", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404028098}, "language": "french", "review": "L'ensemble des Blackwell est une formidable histoire dont Deception en est la meilleure partie.

However, Rosa's family history, on the other hand, hasn't been expanded upon since Legacy; so I hope that more tidbits about that will come up later as well.\n\nOddly, the bonus gallery was absent from this entry, but I'm not bothered by the aspect.\n\nI don't really have any complaints, but I'm a bit worried about the sudden change of the story's direction.\nI'm perfectly content with Rosa and Joey working to help spirits find peace and move on and I was expecting a more linear outcome overall. But it looks like the crew has other plans in mind; which isn't a bad thing, I just hope that it flows well.\n\nI enjoyed this entry quite a bit; there was a lot more exploration and interaction between the characters.\n\nI can hardly wait for the next installment, which appears to to be planned for release sometime this month!", "timestamp_created": 1396603566, "timestamp_updated": 1396603566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9711125": {"recommendationid": "9711125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064644432", "num_games_owned": 3798, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1400014543}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all, I must say I feel a bit cheated. The game runs natively in 640x480 resolution, but other than the title screen and one unused background mentioned in the commentary mode, all art is point resampled from 320x240. It shows and is such a pity, especially given that the background art used ingame is pre-rendered, so it should be a cinch to up-res it natively.\n\nAlso, the whole medium/psychic bashing was extremely heavy handed. I'm all for social commentary, but there's a fine line between this and irrational bashing and I feel this game crosses it at times. Yes, mediums are con artists. This does not mean they feast on child flesh, drink human blood for breakfast, etc, etc.\n\nSpeaking of crossing the line - Joey has been getting meaner and meaner with each game and some of his lines here are downright abusive. Not sure how to feel about that.\n\nOther than that, another improvement from previous game. Really loved the implementation of commentary mode, and it actually had some good insights into development this time instead of n-th musing about how Dave Gilbert met this or that voice artist. Being able to use phone to look up clues was amazing, since you had to travel to PC apartment to do that in previous games, killing pacing in the process.\n\nSome nice, simple puzzles - nothing akin to Donkey Cart puzzle in Discworld or Cat's Mustache from Gabriel Knight 3, everything was really logical. A few conversation puzzles as well, and few instances of needing to combine clues. Good hint system if you ever get stuck, although I still had to look some things online once or twice - though take it with a grain of salt, since I never was good with actual adventure game 'gameplay' - I play them mostly for story/conversations.\n\nPersonal 'not feeling ripped off' price point: $5", "timestamp_created": 1396502455, "timestamp_updated": 1396502455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599629", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9587844": {"recommendationid": "9587844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105974216", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403251060}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042f \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0443\u044e-\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0443, \u0438 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0443 \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0435:\n\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b 4 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430, \u0438 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c.\n\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0438\u0437 \u0434\u0432\u0443\u0445 \u044d\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432:\n\u0412\u043e-\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0445, \u0438\u0437 \u0434\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u0414\u0430, \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 50% \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f.\n\u0412\u043e-\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445, \u0438\u0437 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u044f.\n\u041f\u043b\u044e\u0441\u044b:\n+ \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0430\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0438\n+ \u0410\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\n+ \u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\n\u041c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441\u044b:\n- \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u043d\u0430 \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0435, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0442\u0443.\n\u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c. \u0415\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0435.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1395441960, "timestamp_updated": 1395441960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9574687": {"recommendationid": "9574687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031122224", "num_games_owned": 2534, "num_reviews": 375, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404744948}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "egyed\u00fcli pozit\u00edvuma sz\u00e1momra, hogy nagyon sz\u00e9p j\u00e1t\u00e9k iconja van", "timestamp_created": 1395339191, "timestamp_updated": 1395339191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9542990": {"recommendationid": "9542990", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971419376", "num_games_owned": 1004, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403978427}, "language": "english", "review": "The Blackwell Deception is the fourth game, in the five-game Blackwell Series (with it's conclusion jsut being announced)\n\nThe magnitude of the Story gets bigger this time, and Rosa seems to have not only to free spirits anymore, but seems to face down a much bigger opponent then she wished for.\n\nWhile the Voice acting it here at it\u00c4s absolute best, the ardstyle is a little bit odd at times.\nSome old Assets from the previous games are being reused (the photos) to be coherent, but the Artsytele of the Character Sprites just don't fit the former Asthetic.

A few small quirks were improved upon such as being able to move to the next map without having to switch to the Spirit Medium.\n\nI especially liked the format in which the cases were presented in this game. You get thrown right into a case as a 'tutorial' and then given a few more cases that all eventually converge to one larger idea. I am glad that the Developer finally decided to reveal a bit of information on our ghostly companion and did so in a way that would keep players interested.\n\nThe one thing I didn't really like was how the commentary mode had large bubbles showing up all over the screen. I realize that you can turn it off but if you are trying to go for 100% during the first time, it's a little bit unpleasant. I like listening to the commentary but I'm not fond of the bubbles (the bloopers were funny though).\n\nIt also would have been nice if some of the phone features were used more. I didn't need to read a whole lot of mail so that feature felt a bit underused.\n\nOverall the game was an even better experience than Blackwell Unbound.

It's an old school Point and Click graphic adventure, a genre that's lacking nowadays. No need to say it far exceeded my expectations. I hadn't played a P n' C Adventure this good since the Chzo Mythos collection by Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw. Surely there are other great recent games like the Secret of Monkey Island HD remakes, Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse or Hector: Badge of Carnage but they're nothing new. On the other hand, Blackwell Deception is a breeze of fresh air. If I had to describe it I'd say it is a mixture between The Secret of Monkey Island (the boat segment is clearly inspired by the Pirate LeChuck), Maniac Mansion (the supernatural part of the game), Broken Sword (the ambience) and Beneath a Steel Sky (the gadgets Rosa uses, the disco scenario).\nThe characters are well built and the side dialogues make you know them better if you give the effort. By the end of the game you will really care about what happens to the protagonists (hint on a sequel) .\nThe puzzles are inventive and well thought-out even though I would have liked to see more item combinations. The \"switch character\" system can become a little confusing in the not so obvious bits because you'll need to analyze the effect Rosangela and her \"spiritual guide\" have in each single object to figure out a solution. There's one particular puzzle where you'll need to click the same object for an indetermined amount of times until you succeed, it's kind of random so you might get stuck in that part for some minutes, but it's really nothing serious.\nThe soundtrack is excellent, the trumpet songs reminded me of Dire Straits final studio album On Every Street.\nThe game has some replay value, you will probably miss 2 achievements during the first playthrough and then you still have the commentary mode to finish. \nI got BD for about 4\u20ac with 3 other games (AVSEQ, Oil Rush and To The Moon) so I consider it was a hell of a deal. Unfortunately I started playing the Blackwell saga from the fourth chapter so I didn't know much about characters' backgrounds/side stories but that's not the game's fault. \nI've bought The Blackwell Bundle from Steam since then.

The Blackwell series are a bunch of charming adventure games about a woman that discovers she's actually a spirit medium and with the help of her ghostly assistant is destined to help souls cross to the afterlife.

The characters are likable and develop over the course of the series, biggest example being the protagonist, Rosa, who starts off as goony social r*tard but as she eventually accepts her family's calling she becomes far more confident and outgoing.  The plots for the games make for some real solid supernatural mystery stories and they even take pages from New York City's history books and actually add some lesser known real people from the city's past into the plot. If you like adventure games definitely check these out, especially because the fifth and final game isn't too far away\n\nI also really recommend Primordia and Resonance, which the developer, Wadjet Eye, help publish.

The production values have steadily increased (except for maybe Unbound), and so far this entry has been a high point for me.  I'm already hyped for the conclusion.\n\nThe writing has definitely improved, which in turn has improved the voice over work.  I think this is the first game in the series where I didn't feel like someone was voicing a role that they clearly did not fit.  Overall the voiceover work is pretty solid, and the characterization has improved greatly as well.  Rosa's portrayal as a socially inept writer has been refined out of the \"socially disfunctional\" territory; she's still got the awkward jokes and nerdy quips, but they don't feel as forced as they used to.  Joey actually gets some development which was exciting to see.  And the ghosts in this game were also some of the most interesting in the series.  Each presented a level of character depth not seen before, and it was a joy to learn about each one in order to send them on their way.\n\nThe overall plot hints at an overall series antagonist (just in time, right before the last game), but regardless it's nice to see that.  I expected the scope of this series to stay fairly small, so I'm surprised but intruiged to see where the finale ends up.  \n\nArt has been spotty in the past for this series, but this is one of the best so far.  The background artist really outdid him/herself;  all of the environments are very nicely drawn and feature some pretty impressive lighting effects.  The closeups are very good as well.  The only place I think the art regresses a bit is in the character sprites - I think Convergence's looked nicer overall.  Regardless, this game was a pleasure to look at.  I only wish it ran at 1080p and emulated the low-res look, so it wouldn't screw with my monitors.\n\nThe puzzles were pretty well designed, though some left me frustrated and wandering from location to location, trying to find the one clue I'd overlooked.  The note combiner function is back, which is nice, combined with a mobile phone letting Rosa read email and do searches anywhere, which thankfully prevented a lot of the monotanous pit stops back home featured in Convergence.  \n\nHaving seen how far this series has come, I'm going back on my previous reviews.  I would recommend all of these games to fans of the genre.

Surely, there are planes, helicopters and airports and surely, you don't want aviational vehicles to collide with each other. Other than that, it's just fun and casual management of emerging chaos in pastel colours.\n\n[h1]Planes on a plane![/h1]\n\nYou do get to control colourful planes. They randomly appear from the edge of the screen (with a convenient warning). If you wish, a handy tutorial will show you the ropes, but controls are fun and easy: just drag a path for the plane with mouse. Ideally, the path would end up in an airport, because points are scored for landing planes successfully. Each plane has a specific airport to land coincident by their colour.\n\nYou lose if two aircraft collide with each other. Since the game is in 2D this is hard to prevent for long.\n\nWhile waiting for the inevitable, you can speed up the game. Conveniently enough, if two aircraft are on a collision course the game slows down to normal pace and highlights the two aircraft.\n\nEven though this is nice, the highlighting backfires when there are many aircraft on collision course at once. It becomes difficult to see where the most urgent flying machine is. So you lose. And try again.\n\n[h1]Dispelling the illusion[/h1]\n\nInitially I tried to do nice and pleasant-looking arcs and long-winded landings with the planes but I quickly noted that the planes can actually do 180 degree turns, which dissolved the simulation aspect.\n\nStill, with a large enough number of planes to control, it does become difficult to manage. Different planes travel at different, albeit constant, speed with many having the same airport to land in adding to the complexity. A single game lasts just a few minutes at a time.\n\nThere are 9 different levels with varying difficulty (size, variety of planes) and even a couple with special features, e.g. wind that closes up certain airports. Special features are nice but they are only in place in few levels. There's a minor random element in most levels of slightly changing positions of the airports, of course coupled with a randomized appearance of planes.\n\nA word on music: there's the same jolly, easy-going tune in most levels. Just a couple of levels have a special tune to fit their special theme. While the song is fine, it curiously stops after a while and doesn't resume for some time leaving you alone with the minor sound effects of collision alert and successful landing celebrations. Which are fine. It just weirds me out that the music is off for so long.\n\n[h1]Conclusions[/h1]\n\nEven the nine levels do not last forever. There's content for a few hours of fun. For myself, 3 hours were spent on achievements, which were actually very well thought and enabled additional meaningful challenges. Then I spent an hour or so trying to beat my friends' highscores, regrettably without success. Consequently, leaderboards may or may not generate a few more hours of gameplay for you if you are so inclined.\n\nThe price is pretty good but since it is already an older game (almost 6 years old as of writing this), I'd recommend getting it on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1475013072, "timestamp_updated": 1475013072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609054", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25399989": {"recommendationid": "25399989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010740360", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514528973}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a nice casual game you can pop in and play for a few minutes.

While this is a port of an iOS game, the port is fine, there's no cash shop, and it's built up around actual game mechanics that have some actual depth behind them. The graphics are flash, so they're simple but scale infinitely without quality loss, regardless of the player's resolution. If you have multiple monitors like me there's some weirdness with the game pausing if I do something on a different monitor, but that ended up feeling like a feature instead of a bug most of the time.\n\nThe basic gameplay is managing different kinds of aircrafft that are coming in for landing at an airport. The craft can't land just anywhere and are color coded to match the correct runway. They're smart as bricks but always follow orders perfectly, even at their own peril. The player directs them by clicking and dragging their desired path, similar to how a graphic artist uses a vector pen tool. Different levels = different airports, with their own sets of obstacles and challenges. There are 9 levels and speed up button (hotkey F), but the game autodrops speed back to normal if it decides two planes are too close.\n\nThe main gameplay challenge to the player comes from the random nature of when and where planes appear, the game ratcheting up the number of incoming planes over time, and that the planes come in at different speeds. If two vehicles ever crash, the level is over.\n\nSo what kind of player is Flight Control HD for? The main appeals are:\n(1) Stress relief/relaxation/a diversion. Somewhat like the effect last hitting and denying in DOTA produces for some people, Flight Control creates a zen sort of state where I can turn my higher brain off, wind down, and just enjoy directing planes around for a bit, then get back to whatever I was doing. For me the perfect time to do this is when I'm trying to solve a completely different problem. The casual pick-up-and set-down-whenever-you-want nature of the game also lends itself to this. The soundtrack has only one song. While it won't win any awards, it does fit the mellow mood the game is going for quite well.\n\n(2) Score attack, and RTS micro practice, although this can conflict with using the game to relax. There are online leaderboards, which still work fine 5 years after the game was released. As far as I can tell, the leaderboards also seem to be free of cheating unlike, say, certain indie platformers or the latest Call of Duty titles, so props to the developer for that. Levels start easy but ramp up to quite hard if you're going for a top score. In other words, the game scales with what you put into it. As a result you'll probably get out exactly the level of challenge that you want. Be warned that having 50+ planes on the screen gets stressful, especially on maps with a lot of plane types. My brain just doesn't like that, and I've ragequit a few times.\n\nProbably not worth full price, but for me this game has been surprisingly good.", "timestamp_created": 1432938789, "timestamp_updated": 1432938789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15809855": {"recommendationid": "15809855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023114147", "num_games_owned": 1149, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430394186}, "language": "english", "review": "Simplistic, fun and a good game to relax too after a long day.", "timestamp_created": 1431509538, "timestamp_updated": 1431509538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465116", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15808475": {"recommendationid": "15808475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009671381", "num_games_owned": 975, "num_reviews": 199, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1408133635}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good game.I recommend you buy and play it.", "timestamp_created": 1431495130, "timestamp_updated": 1431634468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15600554": {"recommendationid": "15600554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053042786", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493646421}, "language": "polish", "review": "\u015awietna, prosta gra.

Plus, you can redirect flights as often as you need to avoid collisions.

This game will _break you_!  lol  It has leaderboards for each map too.\n\nEven the first map gets very challenging after 50 planes, and is rough getting over 100.  My high score is 150 and I'm amazed that I managed that.  I usually lose between 70-100.  I just finished trying the 3rd map, a 5 star map.  It started off slow and easy, and then it opened the mother load on me after about 10-15 planes.  Wow!  Talk about massive mega challenge.\n\nThe only thing I would suggest to the Dev, is to add a 3rd speed which is 50% slower than the slow speed is now, that way we can really try and get strategic and micromanage our way through really heavy jams, rather than just saying, \"I always lose about here\".  That would be great, because as it is, you really can't get too far, unless you're an absolute pro at this sort of thing.\n\nImagine playing Tetris and going from level 1, to 'Insta-Drop' in less than 5 minutes.

As until guided by the player these aircraft will continue to just blunder along in the initial direction they were heading in.

Le jeu vous propose d'incarner un contr\u00f4leur de trafic a\u00e9rien, le m\u00e9tier le plus stressant au monde!\n\nFlight Control HD, tout comme son \u00e9quivalent sur l'iPad, repose sur une jouabilit\u00e9 tr\u00e8s simple: vous devrez faire atterrir des avions et h\u00e9licopt\u00e8res sur diff\u00e9rentes pistes, h\u00e9liports et portes-avions. Pour ce faire, rien de plus simple, vous n'avez qu'\u00e0 s\u00e9lectionner ceux qui entrent dans votre espace a\u00e9rien et de tracer une trajectoire vers la destination de votre choix. Le trafic a\u00e9rien devenant de plus en plus dense, vous devrez tout faire pour \u00e9viter les collisions en plein vol. Parfois, vous n'aurez d'autre choix que de rediriger le trafic temporairement, afin de revoir votre strat\u00e9gie globale. Le jeu ne propose une dizaine de niveaux, chacun comportant des configurations diff\u00e9rentes d'a\u00e9roports. Il y a aussi une dizaine de types d'avions, certains se d\u00e9placent tr\u00e8s lentement, d'autres plus rapidement.\n\nHistoire de varier un peu la jouabilit\u00e9, certains niveaux proposent des m\u00e9caniques de jeu uniques. Par exemple, dans un parc d'attractions hivernal enneig\u00e9, o\u00f9 les pistes d'atterrissage ferment et rouvrent en fonction des conditions dominantes, vous devrez notamment garder un \u0153il sur la direction du vent. Autre exemple, dans la brousse australienne, vous pourrez observer l'ambulance a\u00e9rienne locale en action. Lorsque des avions de secours apparaissent, vous devrez faire en sorte de les \u00e9viter puisque leur trajectoire d'atterrissage sera prioritaire. Dans un niveau exclusif \u00e0 la version Steam, vous pourrez diriger des avions de voltige dans le cadre de slaloms a\u00e9riens, afin de maximiser vos points, tout en \u00e9vitant le trafic a\u00e9rien habituel.

It's not my type of game but being older made me more open towards new genres. The first time I've reviewed it on Steam with a few words were in 2010. I'm not surprised that I had the game since that time: I was probably influenced by the cheerful screenshots.\n\nYour goal is to land aircrafts on the right path, avoiding also collisions between them. The more you advance, the more aircrafts you'll have on your screen, and the more difficult it will be to manage everything. Also, you'll unlock new airfields: island, jungle, snow (as part of an old Christmas stuff), circus (where you have to go through portals), etc..\n\nIt's very fun and makes you very aware of what is happening on your screen: some aircrafts are faster than others and it may be a problem at one moment (if their paths are crossing each other). Also, they're coming from every part and they're also different: choppers, big aircrafts, biplanes, military jets, etc.. You can easily spot them because of their shapes but also of their different bright colors (that's also how you can spot the right lane to land). It's a true challenge to manage every one of them once your screen is full of them.\n\nDon't worry though for a collision, you're warned about them: the aircrafts are circled with red and you have, if I remember correctly, a little alarm going off. Also, you're warned from which side they're coming.\n\nWith a perfect landing, you'll be rewarded by a text in different languages, congratulating you. Everything is done to make you proud and also to encourage you to keep the good work.\n\nThe graphics are very colorful and simple and it's perfect for that type of game. Besides, the soundtrack is very cheerful.\n\nFlight Control HD is really a little good game on PC, even if I can see the potential of it on any tablet or mobile device. However, while the game is for everyone, I can also understand that some players will be frustrated by the collisions and the repetitive gameplay: you're landing aircrafts by making them follow a path, praying that no other will cross them unless you decide that it's worth a shot given the speed of each vehicle.\n\nI've played the game a lot for the achievements. I remember mainly one not unlocking despite being sure to have met the requirements but I suppose that it wasn't clear enough for me, or it was my English, or it was just the wrong use of words.\n\nAs I've said, the game was released in 2010. The game is still fun to play today, however, after a little search, the PC version is the less updated: the Android/iOS applications have more content or were at least updated until 2015. The Mac version has an exclusive map too.\n\nI had fun with that game and I never regretted that purchase.", "timestamp_created": 1290202050, "timestamp_updated": 1459597802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492537", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "1117620": {"recommendationid": "1117620", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987111472", "num_games_owned": 602, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 86400}, "language": "english", "review": "I bliver sku bare n\u00f8dt til at f\u00e5 k\u00f8bt det her, det er ganske genialt.

Neben der normalen Ausrichtung nach links oder Rechts, oben oder unten, kann die Schiene noch in sich gedreht werden (->Steilkurve z.B.), das ganze ohne Begrenzung, wer also exakt 176,24\u00b0 biegen will, kann das tun!\nNat\u00fcrlich gibt\u00b4s auch einige Elemente vorgefertigt, ansonsten liegt alles in der Hand des Spielers!\nNeben Ausrichtung und Neigung gilt es auch die L\u00e4nge oder Art (normale Schiene, Bremse, Lift...) zu bestimmen.\n\nDer Editor selbst ist staubtrocken wie eine Blaupause, setzt aber zum Gl\u00fcck nicht voraus, dass man Architektur studiert hat, wobei ein fundiertes Fachwissen \u00fcber Begriffe wie \"Vertex\", \"Helix\", \"Launch\", \"G-Kr\u00e4fte\" sehr vorteilhaft ist.\nAbsolute Neulinge werden also erstmal in die R\u00f6hre schauen bzw. sich \u00fcber kleine runde Strecken ohne viel Tamtam freuen...\n\nNeu hinzugekommen sind dabei sowohl optische als auch spielerische Elemente.\nFortan ist es m\u00f6glich, die \"Abnutzung\" der Strecke einzustellen. Zudem k\u00f6nnen nun via Scrips Events ausgel\u00f6st werden, um z.B. eine Lichtshow zu starten, einen Soundeffekt zu triggern, eine T\u00fcr zu \u00f6ffnen...\n\nF\u00fcr einen Coaster-Fan also DAS Grundpaket zum erstellen seiner Tr\u00e4ume!\n\nTrotz allem ist gerade der Editor extrem komplex und schwer zu bedienen und basiert gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils auf mathematischen Eingaben und Scripts.\nDas Grundger\u00fcst der Strecke ist noch relativ einfach zu erstellen, das Feintuning bez\u00fcglich Neigungen, Radien, Steigungen oder simple Dinge wie die Verz\u00f6gerung der Bremsen oder Geschwindigkeiten von Transportelementen hingegen wird nahezu vollst\u00e4ndig mit Dezimalen eingestellt.\n\n\nEbenso kann man nun auch in die Rolle eines Ride-OP schl\u00fcfen, sprich die Abfertigung vornehmen, Z\u00fcge auf die Reise schicken, aber auch die neuen Abstellgleise bedienen. Im Full-Manual-Modus sogar jede einzelne Bremse und Antriebsm\u00f6glichkeit selbst steuern.\nAuch ist es m\u00f6glich, durch die vom Spieler erstellte Attraktion zu laufen, oder, wenn sich eine weitere Attraktion auf derselbe Karte befindet, zu dieser zu wechseln.\nDass man jeden Sitz des Coasters auch besetzen und mitfahren kann, ist glaube ich selbstverst\u00e4ndlich, wobei eine VR-Unterst\u00fctzung noch etwas mehr Realismus verleiht (Vorsicht: Motion Sickness an der Tagesordnung!)\n\nIst die Kreation dann fertig, steht die erste Testfahrt an. Vermutlich werden sich zu Beginn viele Fehler aufzeigen, wie ungerade Geraden, harte, ruckelige Fahrtverl\u00e4ufe (-> Schl\u00e4ge), zu enge Radien uvm.. Das treibt die G-Werte nat\u00fcrlich in ungesunde Bereiche, also steht wieder verbessern, ausprobieren, verbessern, ausprobieren auf dem Plan, bis es endlich \"glatt\" l\u00e4uft.\n\nUm mit NL2 Spa\u00df zu haben, muss man also einfach ein Freund dieser Art sein, ansonsten ist hier schnell Ende im Gel\u00e4nde.\n\nDu magst \"Kingda Ka\", \"Schwur des K\u00e4rnan\", \"Desert Race\"....? Dann kannst du sie hier nachbauen!\nUnd wer keinen Bock auf bauen hat, greift einfach auf bestehendes Material zur\u00fcck, die die Community im Workshop oder auf verschiedenen Seiten erschaffen hat.\nManch einer l\u00e4sst sich inspirieren und hat pl\u00f6tzlich wieder ein neues Projekt am Start...\n\nGrafisch wurde das Spiel verbessert und wirkt nun noch sch\u00f6ner. Subtile Details wie bewegende R\u00e4der, Bremsen uvw. tragen dazu bei, dass NL2 die wohl sch\u00f6nste und realistischste Simulation am Markt ist.\nFehlende Fahrg\u00e4ste sind da wirklich zu verschmerzen.\nDer Sound ist ebenfalls f\u00fcr dieses Spiel gut gelungen, wobei es nicht wirklich viele Ger\u00e4usche gibt. Die, die es gibt, sind aber realistisch und gut eingebunden.\n\nDa NL2 aber sehr viele physikalische Prozesse in Echtzeit errechnet, ist es von Vorteil, einen leistungsstarken PC zu haben. Ein mit Scripts und Objekten \u00fcbers\u00e4ter Coaster zieht derart viel Leistung, dass die Framerate fast zum erliegen kommt.\nSelbst 4GB Grafikspeicher und 16GB RAM lassen das Spiel, zumindest bei mir, kurzzeitig ruckelig laufen, f\u00e4hrt man alle Optionen voll aus.\n\nMan muss wirklich ein Fan dieser Art Spiel/Programm sein, um Freude zu haben. Wer hier ein Spiel sucht, in dem er eigene Achterbahnen in einigen Minuten erstellen kann, ist bei NL2 absolut an der Falschen Adresse, f\u00fcr diese Zielgruppe gibt es bessere Alternativen, sei es das alte Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, Planet Coaster oder der uralte Disney-Achterbahn-Designer.\nWer hingegen eine Herausforderung sucht und kein Problem damit hat, zu Beginn Tutorials zu verschlingen und Wissen zu erlernen, kann bei NL2 seine Kreationen perfekt umsetzen!\n\nWer also auf der Suche nach einer anspruchsvollen UND realistischen Simulation zugleich ist, ist hier richtig aufgehoben!", "timestamp_created": 1500463374, "timestamp_updated": 1501237399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33555763": {"recommendationid": "33555763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052133234", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503576739}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

It's not a good experience making coasters for this simulator.  It definitely takes tutorials and research to figure out how the park editor works.  There isn't a lot of documentation for this, either, that I could find.  Granted, I primarily got the app for riding coasters, not making them, so i gave up pretty quickly on building anything.  There is Workshop support, so you'll find a lot of coasters to ride.\n\nThe VR controls are also non-existent.  You have to use the mouse and keyboard to navigate every bit of the game, from menu UIs to walking around parks.\n\nNoLimits 2 is worth the $40 if you have a Vive or Oculus or similar OSVR headset and want to experience realistic coaster rides.  I go into it every few weeks for 20-30 minutes at a time.  I also use it as a demo experience for my friends to try out roomscale VR.", "timestamp_created": 1494810544, "timestamp_updated": 1494810544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520548", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31738164": {"recommendationid": "31738164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093031597", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470182553}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is great the best coaster sim ive played however it is not a park management simulator just for those who love building realistic roller coasters", "timestamp_created": 1494730853, "timestamp_updated": 1494730853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31450003": {"recommendationid": "31450003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029535195", "num_games_owned": 1015, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493501532}, "language": "english", "review": "I Really want to love this game, however since it does not have HTC Vive controller support, and even won't support the xbox one controller that i own, i'm left without any options for navigating the menus while in VR.\n\nIt does state that fact on the store menu, which sadly i didn't read before buying, but seriously, good luck typing with your keyboard while you got your vive headset on.", "timestamp_created": 1493502907, "timestamp_updated": 1493502907, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.369991", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31431778": {"recommendationid": "31431778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198303465677", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517664113}, "language": "turkish", "review": "G\u00fczel bir oyun", "timestamp_created": 1493442447, "timestamp_updated": 1493442447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31314220": {"recommendationid": "31314220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185471281", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515125655}, "language": "english", "review": "best game ever \nluv ti game so fuhap it make me hap", "timestamp_created": 1492933793, "timestamp_updated": 1492933793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.360116", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31204585": {"recommendationid": "31204585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010875674", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492452149}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought Planet Coaster on sale and was dissatisfied with the park size limit.

I've read most of them and it seems that they're complaining about either of these two things:\n\n- The VR triggers motion sickness\n- The editor is very complex and thus has a steep learning curve.\n\nI wouldn't have any issues with these two complaints, had they been properly built and supported with valid reasoning. However, that's not the case. Not at all.\n\nOf course the VR will trigger motion sickness for some people, because this is a rollercoaster simulator. If you have a weak stomach in terms of consistent movements, don't buy this game. This should have been obvious before you bought the game in the first place.\n\nListen, if you're in doubt whether to buy this game or not, consider that this is a complex rollercoaster simulator that professional coaster designers use. Most of the community is very passionate about rollercoasters and standards are high. Don't let that scare you off though, instead watch a bunch of tutorials online if you find the editor to be too difficult. You can even choose which path you want to take. You can go with hand building, or math building. I personally could never really find myself within hand building, so i picked math building, which suits me so much better. \n\nThis is a game with a steep learning curve, but with an amazing reward factor. When you've built your rollercoaster and you look at the finished product, you'll certainly be satisfied. No other rollercoaster simulator game can compare to this one when it comes to actively building rides and enjoying the beautiful graphics. \n", "timestamp_created": 1484914514, "timestamp_updated": 1484914514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633422", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29327749": {"recommendationid": "29327749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093602751", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8888, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 219, "last_played": 1521511653}, "language": "english", "review": "hell yes buy this $42.00 worth most realistic thing evvaaaaaaaaaaaaaa get hell yes", "timestamp_created": 1484701680, "timestamp_updated": 1484701680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29299473": {"recommendationid": "29299473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051107746", "num_games_owned": 745, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484585821}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc624\ud058\ub7ec\uc2a4\ub54c \ud558\ub358 \ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8\ucf54\uc2a4\ud130\ub294 \uc815\ub9d0 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub294 \ub290\ub08c\uc774 \ub098\ub358\ub370 \uc774\uac74 \uadf8\ub2e4\uc9c0..\n\ud3c9\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc9c4\uc2ec \ud558\ud488\ud558\uba74\uc11c 20\ubd84 \ud574\ubcf4\uace0 \ubc14\ub85c \ud658\ubd88\ubc84\ud2bc \ub20c\ub800\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\ucc28\ub77c\ub9ac \uc5c5\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\ub9cc \ub41c\ub2e4\uba74 \uc2ac\ub9c1\uc0f7\uc774 \ub354 \uc2a4\ub9b4\uc788\ub294 \ub4ef \ud558\ub124\uc694.\n\n\uc2a4\ud300 \uccab \ud658\ubd88\uc774 \uc774\uac70\ub77c\ub2c8 ..\uae30\ub300\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub108\ubb34 \uc544\uc27d\ub124\uc694.\n\ub2e4\ub9cc \uc5ec\ub7ec \ub864\ub7ec\ucf54\uc2a4\ud130\ub97c \uccb4\ud5d8\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5b4 \uadf8\ucabd \ub9e4\ub0d0\uaed8\uc120 \uc990\uae38\uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uc2e4 \ub4ef.", "timestamp_created": 1484586079, "timestamp_updated": 1484586079, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29215779": {"recommendationid": "29215779", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354817846", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4094, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515801167}, "language": "english", "review": "Hella dope\n", "timestamp_created": 1484275527, "timestamp_updated": 1484275527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29209471": {"recommendationid": "29209471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133938446", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 105, "last_played": 1521648629}, "language": "german", "review": "Echt der beste Simulator ever.

If you do - great, go buy it now!\nThere's a lot of VR experiences I can handle, but there are also a lot that make me sick if I'm not careful. If you like me need to be a bit careful and can't just take it all, I would not for a second recommend this game. I tried around half of a simple, straightforward, up and down rollercoaster ride (maybe 30 seconds) before I was sweatting profusely and had to tear the headset off to keep from throwing up.\nIt should be said that I LOVE real world rollercoasters. Up, down, corkscrews, loops, twirls I've done them all and love them in real life... but in VR it would seem I just can't handle it. The high speed turns with no mitigation or control are just too hard.\nYou can see this as a review of VR rollercoasters in general, from the point of someone who has some problems with VR nausea. Not more than most of my friends who has tried my Oculus though. I don't believe this is a particularly poor implementation, which is why I mention it as a general thing.\n\nReviewing VR is so very difficult, because there is such an intensely physical and individual component to the experience.\nSo all I'm saying is Caveat Emptor: VR Buyer Beware.\n\n\nTLDR; Purely from VR standpoint probably stay away from rollercoasters in general, unless you have no issues with simulation sickness ever.\n\n\n\nPS: I feel super bad giving the devs a \"No\" because of something they can't control.

Mit NoLimits 2 Roller Coaster Simulation wird der Traum jeden Achterbahnfans wahr. Ich pers\u00f6nlich liebe Achterbahnen und deren Technik. Mit diesem \"Spiel\" kann man seine komplett eigene Achterbahn bauen und fahren. Es ist sogar m\u00f6glich einen kompletten Park zu bauen, mit Szenerie, sowie Geb\u00e4uden und sonstigem Schnickschnack und dann durch diesen Park laufen und s\u00e4mtliche Achterbahnen besuchen/fahren. Der Editor ist f\u00fcr Neuzug\u00e4nge echt kompliziert, da war der Editor in NoLimits 1 etwas besser - finde ich zumindest - und \u00fcbersichtlicher. Aber ich werde es weiter versuchen und den Editor irgendwann verstehen.\nDank des Workshops kann man sich zahlreiche Achterbahnen und Parks herunterladen und spielen. Man muss \u00fcbrigens mal ein gro\u00dfes Lob an das Supportteam stellen. NoLimits 2 war urspr\u00fcnglich nicht auf Steam vorhanden. Als diese es auf Steam gebracht haben, konnten alle, die das Spiel von der Webseite gekauft hatten, sich einen kostenlosen Steam-Key zuschicken lassen. Gro\u00dfes Lob mal an dieser Stelle an das Team!\n\nKommen wir zu einem Fazit. Jeder, der auf Achterbahnen abf\u00e4hrt (hehe) - so wie ich - der ist mit NoLimits 2 mehr als genug bedient. Leute, die mit Achterbahnen nichts anfangen k\u00f6nnen, ist dieses Spiel nat\u00fcrlich eher nichts. Man muss schon ein gewisses Gefallen an Achterbahnen mitbringen, um wirklich Spa\u00df am Bauen und dem generellen \"Spielen\" von NoLimits 2 zu haben. Aus pers\u00f6nlicher Sicht habe ich wirklich gro\u00dfen Spa\u00df an NoLimits 2, selbst wenn ich den Editor erst nach 100 Spielstunden verstehen werde. Klare Kaufempfehlung f\u00fcr alle Achterbahnfans!\n\nEDIT: Wow! Ich habe den Editor nun verstanden und es macht sau m\u00e4\u00dfig Spa\u00df!

NoLimits 2 is a fantastic piece of software, yeah, software, because, according to the makers, they are targeting realism now and they prever to call it a simulation-program. Keep in mind this ISIN'T RollerCoaster Tycoon or Thrillville.\n2. You can't be a sadistic a-hole and watch people die, 2 reasons: there aren't any peeps in the entire simulation, just steel, wood and foliage. The second reason is that you can't crash a coaster, if it hit's the end of the open track it just displays and error stating that the coaster has crashed.\n3. If you want to make rollercoasters, of course you do, you have to learn it. It's not that you build gorgeous tracks within the first hour, propably not even after 10 hours of learning. There aren't track-pieces like RollerCoaster Tycoon, it's more CAD-style based, just open air. Actually it's an editor where you can design almost anything inside.\n4. You can add buildings, etc. to it, but you have to make them in a program like SketchUp, 3DSMAX, etc. Than you have to export -> import them. As you see, this is not a game for people who don't have patient, this is a quality program which is rather serious.

Very difficult. This game is very time consuming in the way that it takes a long time to create a rollercoaster. You do get a feeling of accomplishment when you make a perfectly smooth coaster and it is the closest thing to building a rollercoaster virtually.

I haven't come across a single bug, corruption or actually any issues at all other than my stupidity. Very neat and professional, finished and generally a really good game. Just be prepared to get bored of it if you're not the best coaster creator. It is harder than I expected.

If this interests you, then NoLimits 2 will be a good choice. Your enjoyment of NoLimits 2 is likely bound to how many of these items apply to you:\n[list]\n    [*]In RollerCoaster Tycoon, you loved the coaster building process the most\n    [*]You're a coaster enthusiast\n    [*]You enjoy simulation games even if you don't \"play\" them avidly\n    [*]You're the creative type who enjoys a blank canvas or a sandbox with no goals or restrictions\n[/list]\nBonus points if these apply to you:\n[list]\n    [*]You love 3D modeling\n    [*]You love programming\n[/list]\n\nIf 2 of any the above match you, then I'd maybe pick up the game on sale, as you may still enjoy it but perhaps won't sink tons of hours into it. Do note that NoLimits 2 has never gone on sale for anything more than 20%, so don't expect deep discounts on Steam sales.\n\nIf 3 match you, then you might enjoy NoLimits 2 as a casual user. If you're the type that just likes to check out the simulation, as well as how insanely creative/detailed people are, there's plenty to download and explore with the Steam workshop and fan websites. You may find yourself tinkering with building your own coasters, but some may lose interest given the vast array of tools at your disposal.\n\nIf 4 or more match you, then I would recommend this game at full price.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[h1]Comparison with Planet Coaster[/h1]\n\nPlanet Coaster is a game. NoLimits 2 is a simulator.\n\nIf you enjoy building parks, NoLimits 2 has the ability, but it's not really designed to do this out of the box. You can place some flat rides that come bundled with the game, and you can download more off of the Steam workshop. However, there are no paths, people, or any real tools to build anything efficiently. It's just custom scenery and terrain painting.\n\nPlanet Coaster also does a *really* well with its coaster builder. They did a fantastic job of compromising realism and customization with ease of use. If you're just looking for a more realistic RCT3, I would highly recommend Planet Coaster if even for the building coasters alone. You can get fairly close to real life in terms of appearance. Of course, it's still pretty far away from NoLimits 2 in terms of physics, finesse, precision, and overall realism. As a starting point though, it's a nice way to get the basics of coaster design, then transition into something like this.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[h1]Comparison with Theme Park Studio[/h1]\n\nDo not buy Theme Park Studio. It is an incomplete Kickstarter early access mess that is lacking in both gameplay and realism. I'd even wager that Planet Coaster has better realism.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[h1]Opinion:[/h1]\n\nNaturally, this is the absolute benchmark for accurate roller coasters. The level of intricacy with which someone can design their dream ride is unparalleled by any other software. As with anything this realistic, there is a learning curve that comes with the program if you wish to design your own. However, compared to NoLimits 1, the rate at which new users are becoming proficient truly speaks for how well the new track building system is. Some of the amazing works you'll see on YouTube, the Workshop, and NL fansites were created by people who just picked up the game a couple months ago.\n\nNow, would I recommend this game to those don't plan to build? If you're a roller coaster fanatic, I'd still say yes. With Steam's integration you can download other tracks with absolute breeze. Plus there's other options to further satisfy your hunger for rides: sites like NoLimitsCentral.com and CoasterCrazy.com provide an excellent abundance of things to download to your heart's desire.\n\nIf realism isn't your forte, go make that 1000 ft tall mountain racer you've always wanted. If you can build it, the simulation will always run it.\n\nHowever, the fact that some recreations get within inches of their real-life counterparts just shows the level of detail with which you can sculpt the rails. And for some, having that dead-on accuracy makes each ride feel as though they could be built into real life. You can build your dream ride, watch it go, and truly imagine it existing at your favorite amusement park so long as you could print out blueprints. That feeling is truly awesome and cannot be replaced IMO.", "timestamp_created": 1420268372, "timestamp_updated": 1508641947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.827989", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13458155": {"recommendationid": "13458155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084393715", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469375753}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are interested in rollercoasters and want to design and create your own this is the only sensible choice out there.\nThis progam enables you to create realistic rollercoasters and has an entire script engine and has realistic momentum simulation.\nI highly recommend this program. :)", "timestamp_created": 1419024910, "timestamp_updated": 1419024910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.627255", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13365952": {"recommendationid": "13365952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020106192", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 10538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512940341}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved this game since it came out!\nBeatiful graphics, ultra-realistic physics, and a powerful tool for bringing rollercoaster ideas to life!\nThe learning curve is steep, but once you master the game the possibillites of creation has no limits (see what I did there?

Its focus on realism and customizability stands out as well as the performance on weaker machines (as long as the user-built parks are optimized that is). Although building your very first coaster can be quite a task the editor is easy to control, all buttons are neatly arranged.\nYou can take in-game screenshots with depth of field and adjustable field of view which can often be close to reality and are able to deceive unaware people (and sometimes even the \"pros\"). If pictures are too boring for you there is an option for recording videos for which you can enable a motion-blur effect.\nMany prefabricated supports are available to help you getting your first coaster done pretty fast. Those can be atomized and customized, or you can build your own supports from scratch with nearly unlimited sizes (from 0.001 m and 2 m) and a few distinct shapes (which can be cloned for easier placement). For wooden coasters it's even possible to auto-generate the supports.\nFurthermore, you can choose between many different track connectors and adjust where you want to have friction wheels, friction brake runs or magnetic fins. Custom scenery objects are supported, too. Those inlcude .3ds, .lwo and .dae files and lighting effects are just awesome when used wisely since shadow-casting ones can have a large impact on performance.\n\nWell, I just cut a long story short at this point: NoLimits 2 Roller Coaster Simulation has so many features I guess many users haven't discovered everything this program has to offer yet.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough already, the devs regularly provide the (very friendly and helpful) community with updates which will also eventually include new coaster styles and features in the future.\n\n\nSoo ... what are you waiting for? Stop reading this review, get yourself a copy of NoLimits 2 and dive into the wonderful world of speed, height, thrill and fun.

It has a nearly endless seeming list of new features, most of which make things a whole lot easier than No Limits 1. There really is no competition. It's like comparing school cafeteria food to Olive Garden. It took 8 years but it was worth the wait.\nI really like how much easier the building system is compared to NL1. That's one of my favorite things about NL2. That combined with auto-heartlining the track, I feel like I can build any sequence of curves how I want, in any shape. I don't really feel the need to look back or live in the past.\nThe graphics, while not a top priority for me, were made with TLC. The terrain editing, environments, and tree models pretty much encourage the user to make the most of it, particularly if they're designing a terrain coaster.\nThe combs, while not exact, give an indication of how I'm doing at making the ride survivable and smooth, and help take away more of the artificial difficulty that NL1 had. Having multiple viewports is slightly awkward but I can watch the G's of one viewport while watching the radii in the other. With this much in the way of new features to aid in smooth design, I feel like I can comfortably stick with hand-building, not even think about touching FVD++ (no offense Lenny). I really wanted to make smooth, heart-lined track and be able to easily adjust earlier portions at will if needed, and now I can.\nThe NL2MAT editor is pretty complicated for me, and I'm not sure if any adequate tutorials for that exist. Of course, scripting is even more complicated for me. I really like the scripting engine allows one to use custom trains. In fact, the attachment script is so versatile one can use it for custom trains, attaching headlights, automobiles, Tin Lizzies-type rides, Raging Rapids River Rides, etc. And this is just one little script. Too bad the scripting language is too complicated for most users.\nAs awesome as this program is, there are a few things I don't like.\n-If I forget which park had a particular coaster I want to work on, I have to open and check each park. Search bar won't do.\n-Testing the ride just in the editor seems to have been removed.\n-G-force combs ignore dive machine holding brakes.\n-Importing an element makes all the roll nodes 'strict' so I have to uncheck 'strict' on at least most of them. Might be a bug.\nOverall I recommend this game for any roller coaster enthusiast, and anyone who wants to make virtual coasters but finds NL1 too hard.

But while they all focus on different aspect of theme parks (RCT is more about management, Thrillville is more game play oriented), none of theme focused exclusively on what I like the most: roller coasters.\n\nWith NoLimits 2, all that has changed.  Instead on focusing on multiple aspects of theme parks, NL2 is dedicated exclusively on roller coasters.  You build them, you ride them, and you share them. In fact, NL2 feels more like a development tools for roller coaster designers than a game simulation.\n\nBuilding coasters in other applications was always a little awkward.  With NL2, building coaster is so easy almost everybody can built a coaster within minutes.  You still need to understand a few basics concept (like blocks for example) and understand how to use the tools.  But when you understand these fundamental concepts,  you will be able to build incredible coasters.  From there, your imagination is the only limit.  \n\nThe included documentation provides just enough to get you going.  If you want more information, some excellent tutorial videos are available on YouTube.\n\nOn a technical side, the application runs surprisingly well on laptops.  I had to set the resolution to 1280x720, but other than that, it works very well.  I can now build coaster when I am on the road.\n\nI have yet to experiment with scripting and scenery so I cannot comment on these features.  But all in all, I am very satisfied with this application.  And the more I play, the more I find that while building a coaster is easy, building a GOOD coaster is hard and challenging. And when I see what other people do, I know that I have a long way to go before I could build a good coaster.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1410099171, "timestamp_updated": 1410099171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510835", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11979236": {"recommendationid": "11979236", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991704763", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453234202}, "language": "french", "review": "Je n'ai pas d'heure de jeu sur cette version car j'ai achet\u00e9 NLRCS 2 bien avant sa sortie sur steam, bref.\nCe que je peux dire c'est qu'\u00e9tant fan des anciennes versions du programme (no limits v1 \u00e0 v1.8), la version NoLimits Rollercoaster 2 simulation est 10 fois, non 100 fois mieux \u00e9labor\u00e9 qu'avant !!\nLes graphismes sont g\u00e9niaux (bon ce n'est pas non plus BF4) les d\u00e9tails sont bien pr\u00e9sent, comme sur le systeme de freinage, o\u00f9 les plaquettes se presse pour freiner le train.\nLe systeme de pluie etc, le systeme du temps \"temps reel\" il fait nuit chez vous? il fera nuit dans le jeu.\nMMMMM que dire d'autre...ha oui !

This is a simulator specifically for roller coasters. \n\nNo limits 1 was the most successful rollercoaster simulator on the consumer market but 8 years ago was when the makers announced NoLimits 2. NoLimits 2 was out at the beginning of 2014 and I was just amazed at the detail and new features. This simulator has astonishing details and physics. Now for my review I'll start with the editor (I will compare with the original NoLimits 1). \n\nEditor: \nThe editor in NoLimits 2 is really advanced and lets you do a lot more than NoLimits 1. First they introduced scripting which allows you to go beyond the limits of what's in the editor. But as with going with track placement, they are still doing the spline based track placement. But it has changed since NoLimits 1 as it's based off of vertexs and control polygons. The supports are the same as NoLimits 1 where it's just a single spline and node. One of my favorite features is the new import options, NoLimits 1 was stuck with .3ds formats but NoLimits 2 allows for Obj. formats which are far superior. the new editor also has a build in FVD tool and allows math formulas. \n\nSimulator: \n\nCommunity:", "timestamp_created": 1409161143, "timestamp_updated": 1409173223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570224", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11867615": {"recommendationid": "11867615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049786129", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509260454}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game to play if you are a roller coaster fan.

It's a simulation and a tool made for people who may already have a wider knowlage of roller coasters. It has no park management features like Rollercoaster Tycoon. Nolimits often requires a quite in-depth understanding of rollercoaster engineering, physics and a passion for theme parks and roller coasters. If you're a Rollercoaster Tycoon player who wants to try something new, try the demo first.\n\nPros:\nRealistic-This is the most realistic design tool for roller coasters. It's not just stunning in terms of visuals, it's full of tiny details that enthusiasts can all recognise and appreciate.\n\nMassive improvement from NL1-Everything in the editor has been vastly improved, you could spend hours just fixing g-force spikes and bumps that aren't apparent in the editor. The G-force comb is nothing short of glorious, it allows you to fully finetune rides to perfection without the need for other software like Newton.\n\nImproved terrain editor-The simple addition of tunnels make this many times better than NL1.\n\nVerity-NL2 has more coaster types than you're likely to master. Classic corkscrew coasters to B&M diving coasters, this simulation has everything. I would have liked to see more family style coasters though.\n\nScripting-This is probably the biggest advance for NL2, it makes coaster extremely flexible, though it has some problems I'll mention later.\n\nStation improvements-The addition of dueling stations and tandem stations is very helpful for creating realistic rides.\n\nControl panel-In NL1 controlling the ride was pretty much pressing the f9-11 keys, now it's fully functional and allows you to control individual block segments. It's surprisingly fun to operate rides in the simulation, some people have even made their own physical USB control panels. Unfortunately for the people building their own controls, there is a lack of hotkeys for operation, all block controls must be controlled with the mouse (but this isn't much of a loss).\n\nCons: It\u2019s important to be honest, there are some serious problems which aren't fixable but could potentially ruin your experience of NL2. \n\nNo lessons learned from Newton-When people are forced to use other software for the actual design of a ride, there's a problem. The NL1 editor was very hard to use if you were building a coaster from scratch with no help from programs like Newton; NL2 has somewhat eliminated the need for Newton but a combination of Newton's perfectly smooth curve and the already amazing editor would have been beyond perfect.\n\nScripting-It's a gift wrapped with a lock and chains. If you have difficulty wrapping your head around scripting transfer tracks and switches, you're screwed. Like with Newton, the NL community has made some software to make scripting easier but it simply isn't enough. (What would have been perfect is a second scripting method based of placeable triggers, It would be less flexible but certainly easier to use).\n\nAnd that's pretty much it.\n\nWould I recommend NL2 to the average steam user? No.\nWould I recommend NL2 to fan of Roller Coaster Tycoon fans? Maybe.\nWould I recommend NL2 to roller coaster enthusiasts?

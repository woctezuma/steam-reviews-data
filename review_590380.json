If you like chess, then you'll like this. \n\nOverall, it's far less engaging, far less rewarding.

Each battle starts with the player placing their mechs onto the field. Each mech has health, movement and an ability or 2 as well as the option to heal. Vek also have health, movement and an ability or 2. Once the mech are place the battle begins and the Vek move about the board attacking buildings or mechs. Each building represents power to the grid (the players overall health). Once the grid is depleted or all your mechs are destroyed, the game is over and the player will have to start over.\n\nCombat\nCombat involves dealing with the Vek threat as new ones spawn every turn. But shooting them to death isn't always an option, nor is it always the best option. Not only can players kill the vek, but they can move them as well. Different abilities allow the player to push the Vek about. Pushing them into another object yields extra damage. Pushing a Vek into a hazard can allow a low damage unit the power to kill a stronger enemy. Because the Vek attack order is known (an icon in the top right will inform the player), players can manipulate the Vek into attacking each other. Pushing can be used defensively as well to free up a teammate that has been immobilized, push a vek away from attacking the grid, or push a Vek onto a spawn point thus delaying an enemy from joining the fray. There is no time limit, so players are free to contemplate as long as necessary to create the best turn.\n\nInto the Breach is more than just tactics though. During each battle their are optional objectives (which the player will know of in advance). Completing these objectives during a battle can heal the player's grid or yield reputation which is spent at the end of each island to purchase new items. Completely all the objectives on a island grants the player bonus item (notice I do not say protecting all the civilians and the grid is needed to \"perfect\" an island). \n\nFurthermore, each mech his a pilot that can gain up to 2 passive bonuses, such as more movement or health, and Unique pilots have a special ability like armor to prevent damage or the ability to fly. If your mech is destroyed in combat, the pilot dies and is replaced with an AI that cannot gain abilities though can be replaced with a new pilot if one is found. Reactor cores, which can be found, earned through objectives, or bought for reputation grant more power to a mech to have more health, movement or upgrade their abilities. Players may have to sacrifice grid or pilots to serve the greater good while managing their upgrades and weapons to be prepared for whatever the Vek throw at them.\n\nPlayer can be severely punished for mistakes. It is easy to miss a Vek passive or a push interaction that unravels a player's plans. The devs do provide some leniency in allowing moved mechs that haven't attacked to be returned as well as a single turn reset per battle. Still, an early mistake can mean missing out on upgrades which can snowball into not keeping up with the increasingly tougher enemies.\n\nThe enemy AI can be manipulated to some extent (the degree of which I do not know) as players are aware how much an enemy can move and their attack/abilities. Trying to anticipate enemy movement can be frustrating and is the biggest RNG in the game. I cannot say for certain the game is 100% fair which may turn off some players.\n\nExperience\nThe visuals are functional but not stunning. The music by Ben Prunty is excellent. There is a good deal of replay ability with 10 squads of 3 mechs each to start with as well as a custom and random squad option. There are 3 difficulty settings allowing players to ease themselves into the game (in fact, nearly all achievements can be completed on easy mod). There are moments when I felt like I was totally screwed on a turn only to finally figure out the correct play which is an amazing feeling. I appreciated the abundance of FTL references as well. \n\nI haven't experienced any bugs (outside of the Vek) or crashes in 77 hours of play. There are a few aspects in regards to interaction that are not clear at the onset, such as buildings take no damage from fires or to heal a mech you select its repair ability then target the mech.

It's a very fun and satisfying game besides that but it's very arguably a huge issue in a game like this where finding solutions is the game. The AI just randomly decides to perfectly counter everything you've done. Only thing keeping them from being overwhelming is how they say what their next actions are, but that's nothing if they just position properly which they normally can't. Normally.\n\nDefending satalites? They'll randomly lock you behind a satalite and force you to sit next to it as the satalite launches next turn. That instakills your pilot. It's an awful feeling for all the strategy to be nothing compared to the power of 3 individual enemies perfectly blocking you in while one goes off to the side and perfectly blocks the only other pilot that can get you out in a way where your currently useless guy cannot free either. Your positioning just ends up perfect for the enemies to fuck you up, but it's not like you really had the choice as you HAD to be there to solve the last puzzle or that's how it was solved but new enemies came up and you had no clue 3 spider guys were coming out so no way to prepare.\n\nOtherwise it's still a very fun game, and you CAN take hits and you CAN lose stuff. So this isn't a case of \"losing to enemy brain/spawn rng\" although that sometimes is the case where you can't solve the fact that you will lose the next turn. Hardly no positioning and preplanning can really avoid this issue. Although this game is its own interesting and unique game, seperate from the dev's other work FTL, it still in some way suffers from the power of RNG. Which is sad, but who cares as it still stays fun and skill-based regardless. Just kind of sucks that this game had this drawback. But it's to be expected, no game is absolutely perfect.\n\n\nEDIT: Also the UI is a tiny bit confusing at times, kinda hard to see who does what and where they are attacking even a few hours in.

Because of that, the game can't really throw anything really difficult at you (you can't make informed decisions about the next turn anyway, so it would be just unfair), and all single-turn problems are somewhat trivial after you familiarized yourself with each squad's abilities.\n\nSo, from your perspective you will have:\n1) Solvable turns: ones where you took 0 damage, moved towards mission objectives, and blocked as many spawns as you wanted, depending on your goals. Those turns are very satisfying at first, but becoming annoyingly mundane after a few hours.\n2) Unsolvable turns: very rare occasions (usually on Hard mode, near the end) where you have to sacrifice something (a time pod, some grid power, or maybe a mission objective), because the spawns did not cooperate, you didn't get any good weapons from the previous areas, and you literally can't stop all enemies no matter what you do.\n\nIndividually, unsolvable turns are unlikely to end your campaign, but you will probably get frustrated anyway, because it feels like you are losing not because you made any mistakes, but just because some stupid RNG made you to. Developers obviously tried to minimize the amount of situations like that, so most turns are solvable \"in 1 turn\", and therefore have a very limited strategic depth.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game as a very unique strategy/puzzle experience, just don't expect getting hundreds of hours of fun out of it.", "timestamp_created": 1521430306, "timestamp_updated": 1521430306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.672986", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40912445": {"recommendationid": "40912445", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964142424", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 336, "last_played": 1521435704}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolutely amazing game.

You will not be disappointed with how this game is similar to FTL but also completely different.\n\n    [*]Ok now that sounds contradictory, but let me tell you that the game is rogue like, short campaigns, different starting mech squads with different playstyles and similar purchasable gear sot that anyone that has played FTL will feel just at home with.\n\n    [*]Now everyone even me at first was like but how do the mechanics work? It seems so simple and casual when you look it at face value. This game is more like chess than a typical RTS. You have 3 mechs that all have vastly different abilities. The goal isn\u2019t only to kill enemies; it\u2019s to not lose power by not letting buildings get attacked.  Your mech\u2019s can push, pull, damage, swap, stun, make enemies kill each other; you do this with a few simple attacks at most 2 for each mech. You can choose to have only 1 attack for each mech when you find a good passive or limited use per battle ability. This might sound simple to you but what really shines it the way you use these abilities. \n\n    [*]The game requires careful planning of your attacks, the enemy\u2019s turn is told to you so that you have to maneuver them away from damaging building, objectives, or you mechs with the abilities mentioned above. You will almost always have more enemies than mechs and at times more than double. The beauty is when you come with a plan to not take damage and make enemies damage or kill each other. Abilities mechs can have range from a simple push an enemy and damage, pull toward mech, and ranged rocket with 4 cardinal tile push. You can get advanced with self-damaging ramming pushes with shields from another to prevent said damage, freeze you and another enemy, to swapping an enemy with your flying unit over lava or water that kills them instantly. I\u2019m trying to say that the abilities of each squad are designed to be used together or harmonize well and when used to win odds that seemed impossible to prevent is amazing and happened so much for me.\n\n    [*]You get a good variety of enemies, a charging one, line of sight ranged, artillery ranged, 2 kinds of melee, one normal and another that prevents movement unless broken out of tile range, explosive spawning and spider spawning (my most hated enemy) and a passive one that buffs enemies that until killed that gives buffs like extra health, armor, regenerating health or explode on death.  Maps start with a few and more spawn each turn, but can be delayed when something is on top of the spawn damaging what is there. You do get buffed version of each enemy that increase health, damage and maybe some range. You have bosses for each island that more just the normal enemies but more health and damage which was kind of lame. There was only one boss that was a slime that duplicated weaker versions with each death that was amazing. Wish more were like this.\n\n    [*]The length of each campaign depends on how many islands you want to save before attempting the final level. You can save 2-4 before doing this and it scales that last fight depending on how many you completed. On these islands you get more missions than you can complete so you can choose ones depending on what you need more; power, cores or reputation with some giving all three but are the harder ones. You can spend cores to upgrade mechs abilities, health and movement. You spend reputation when you save an island on new pilots, abilities more cores or more power.\n\n    [*]There are 8 squads to unlock with the ability to play with custom or randomized squads as well. You unlock them by getting the achievements you see on Steam which isn\u2019t that hard to get enough coin to unlock them all. There is a secret squad for those that get every achievement. \n\n    [*]I think that\u2019s all the important stuff out of the way. Since it is rogue-like you can lose a lot, by having no power, not by having all mechs destroyed, that does have consequences like losing your precious pilot, I didn\u2019t like having to restart if a mistake or bad luck was made 2 hours into the final mission, this is my personal desire to not waste so many hours starting over all the time, so I backed up all my saves, which some might think is cheating, but it prevented me from playing this for twice my playtime with that many failures that I had. This was so much easier and faster to do, taking seconds instead of starting over and losing hours of playtime. ( I\u2019m finding this happening more as I get older and now understand the plight of not having enough time to game)\n\n    [*]Overall the game is just as good and memorable as FTL if you\u2019re wondering. The chess like gameplay is unique and more complicated than at first sight. The combinations of mechs are spot on, with each squad requiring a different approach on how to handle enemies. The replayability is great with 7 different full campaigns completed for me personally. I have no doubt the game will get mod support that will make it even better and a release on tablets. This is not negative as the game could be played with touchscreen controls. The UI is that easy to use.

You could be too far away to prevent damage, lack the equipment, and sometimes need to hurt yourself for the greater goal.

Achieving victory after the 3rd or 4th island gets really tricky even on \"easy\", frustrating on \"normal\", and absolutely unfair on \"hard\" setting. It also depends on which squad you are using. Some mechs can't even inflict damage outright, just manipulate positions. This game can be as hard or easy as you like. I loved that aspect.

Yeah, I'm down with spoiling the outcome of the review like that because honestly, I can't imagine many players being able to repress their fondness for what is surely one of the most charming video games we'll see all year.\n\nThe setting once again takes us into the far future where humanity's interstellar colonization has drew them the ire of the Vek; a hostile race of insectoid aliens that don't appreciate human-y things like power plants or buildings full of helpless people. A small band of time-travelling soldiers is all that stands between them and total annihilation and so as commander of this elite squad it's your job to direct the mechanised troops in order to push back the Vek and protect your employer's interests across four warring islands.\n\nAt first glance the game is somewhat reminiscent of an obscure title called Faselei! where players would program giant mechs to carry out actions in a later phase. With Into the Breach, only the enemy turns are programmed in advance and the player's time will be spent trying to foil those impending threats by any means necessary.\n\nThose who bemoan a lack of true heroism in video games can rejoice at last because innocent lives are very important to your ongoing success here. Every battlefield structure is linked to your primary energy grid and thus when a building full of bystanders is razed - alongside a guilt-imposing alert of how many casualties were just sustained - the grid's health depletes along with it. In true roguelike fashion there's no reloading a save or checkpoint either, so learning to protect the grid is essential if you hold any hope of reaching the final mission.\n\nIt's no coincidence that each map shares the same 8x8 tile layout as a chessboard because the elements that make Chess such a painstaking pleasure are very much evident here too. Into the Breach is all about minimization and I'm not just referring to how adorable the giant mechs look in pixel art. Minimizing the damage caused by the Vek is your paramount concern and yet there are times when minimizing the risk of future turns is just as vital. Similar to Chess, you can get very good at Into the Breach by thinking multiple turns ahead of your current position and there will be many times where you'll need to sacrifice your pieces - or should I say, pilots - in order to prevent key objectives from failing.\n\nPositioning is a vital concept here and simply moving enemies from one tile to another is sometimes the best tactic for maintaining control of the board. Many weapons include the ability to push other units because of this and you'll find the tempo of battle flows in your favour when enemies can be pushed into water (often drowning them for an instant kill) or onto tiles where other enemies would have otherwise spawned.\n\nThe sheer tactical awareness that this sort of approach requires is made easier to digest by the gorgeous user interface. Every attack vector and unit ability is clearly signposted through the use of animated tooltips and the tutorial featuring the well-balanced Rift Walkers squad will have new players aware of the basics in minutes.\n\nThat's not to say that every rule is as clear as it could be. I'm not sure why buildings are immune to fire for example and it's not always clear what effect certain actions will have on tiles that are undergoing a status change. Do smoke clouds counteract any existing status effects? Do flying enemies drown if they're hit by a freeze ray whilst they're hovering over water? Do they thaw out when the same occurs over lava or A.C.I.D.?\n\nThis aspect of trial and error can occasionally upset things and the lack of reference means that you'll likely be making mistakes even after mastering the game's subtleties. An in-game encyclopedia would have been a nice addition in this sense, but then again perhaps that would've added more clutter than is really necessary.\n\nIt's important to always be informed though because like FTL, Into the Breach is another one those games where a single bad move from the player can spell disaster. Fortunately Subset Games dialled the difficulty back a bit here by adding an inspired reset turn option which acts as a one-use lifeline that will frequently help players escape some of their more common blunders.\n\nOpening up the game even further is a robust achievement system which unlocks brand new squads of mechs to play with. Maybe you'll harness the power of lightning as Blitzkrieg, burn the Vek to a crisp as the Flame Behemoths, or just make your own fully customized team from any mech that you have available. Surviving pilots are another persistent bonus that can be carried over between sessions and because the campaign's length can be freely determined by the player, it helps anyone who is less skilled see more of what's on offer without having their progress walled off.\n\nThere's so much more awesome content to discover that's it's hard to do justice to it all. Consider though the little dollops of character brought about by the writing and Ben Prunty's catchy soundtrack, the myriad bonus objectives that thrust players into cameos alongside allied tanks and terraforming machines and earthquakes, tidal waves, erupting volcanoes, and haywire robots frozen in ice.\n\nWill the grid defences hold this turn? you ask, as another Vek mortar flies through the air towards a robotics factory that you really needed to protect but got so caught up in the turn that you forgot to keep it covered! And so too will there be stories of the miracles you pulled off in the face of adversity and the combos you made involving that one weapon acquisition or that one custom squad full of OP Cryo Mechs.\n\nIt's an addictive package to be sure, one so entertaining and intuitive that the biggest challenge can be finding something to criticize. If you want a direct comparison with FTL, then Into the Breach does seem to have a shorter lifespan because of its minimalist design. This is an easier game on the whole (to the point of tedium if you play on the Easy setting) and certain scenarios will start to feel samey with fewer chaotic elements to consider. There's also a minor point concerning its final mission that whilst still thinky and backed by a wonderfully tense piece of music, doesn't compare to the outright climax of felling the Rebel Flagship.\n\nBut so too is this game more accessible than its predecessor and the rules that govern it more dependable for the entry level strategist. I observed very few bugs in this release build and the overall impression I get is that a lot of time went into making the experience as smooth and as satisfying as possible. The prevalence of 'turn angst' not withstanding of course!\n\nIf the game shares one major thing in common with FTL, then it's the fact that I want to immediately start playing it again only moments after shutting it down. It was never going to be easy for Subset Games to equal the brilliance of their first effort, but honestly, with Into The Breach they may have just topped it.\n\n[url=https://www.celjaded.com/into-the-breach-review/]Read the full review at my blog \u00bb[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1521459214, "timestamp_updated": 1521459214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40917414": {"recommendationid": "40917414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029983303", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 668, "last_played": 1521398251}, "language": "english", "review": "Chess with nice pixel graphics, cool soundtrack, about giant robots fighting giant monsters, but everything looks like miniatures - what else could you possibly want!", "timestamp_created": 1521457387, "timestamp_updated": 1521457387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40917222": {"recommendationid": "40917222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289764899", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2831, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2654, "last_played": 1521732557}, "language": "schinese", "review": "We need Chinese\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1521456374, "timestamp_updated": 1521456374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40915990": {"recommendationid": "40915990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075306853", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 4303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2557, "last_played": 1521657979}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is just perfect for me.

It holds a lot of potential. It has solid gameplay mechanics, but it suffers from lack of quantity. It has quality, but after two or three runs, you'll find the game feeling really samey. Regardless of what Squad selection you roll.\n\nThere just isn't enough variety in this game, at the time of this review. The enemy selection is very limited. What at first glance may look like a sizeable selection, is simply artificial inflation via Enemy Recolors. Recolor enemies (Usually called such as Alpha Centipede and so on) will simply have more health and deal more damage. But otherwise will behave the same way as the weak variants of the same enemy. \n\nThere's limited Missions in the game and with an already limited selection of missions, it is further split across four islands. This just further accelerates how fast the game grows stale, in its current state. As you'll quickly find yourself playing out very similar if not the same situations over and over. Due to there just being limited mission types. And to avoid spoilers, the big climax mission (The Final level/stage/mission) is very anti climatic.\n\nOverall, the game feels like an Early Access title. There just isn't enough going on for $15 dollars. Where as the previous title (Which is seen in ITB's cover page), FLT, is cheaper and has MORE content.

The only real statistical mechanic is that when buildings get hit, they have a (base 15%) chance to resist it.\n\nBasically, if you go wrong, it's your own fault (and it feels fairer than FTL did). You even get to reset a whole turn (all 3 units moves) every mission if you mess up.

In strategy terms I'd liken it to a game of chess. You know all the moves your opponent can make, but what you need to think about is not the next turn - but the turn after, and the turn after that. Can you think ahead and set yourself up to counter the next 5 turns?\n\n[h1]Survival Strategy[/h1]\n\nIf so, you win the round. You don't need to destroy the enemy - you simply need to survive and save as many people and power as possible. If the enemy attacks a building, you lose power to the grid. If the power \u26a1\ufe0f\u26a1\ufe0f is gone, it's game over. Humanity is doomed... in this timeline anyway. Into the Breach is is a slow paced strategy puzzle game of thinking ahead and protecting your assets from all directions, occasionally sacrificing your own life. You're expendable, but the universe is not. \n\nEnemies are varied and differ from island to island, with map mechanics and your own varying team abilities thrown in. So calling it similar to chess is a very simple analogy - it's a lot more complex with a lot more components thrown in to the mix. If you're thinking it sounds a little too cerebral, you don't need an eidetic memory as the moves from your opponents are telegraphed for the next turn which simplifies things in the short-term. As you go up in difficulty and play around with different team mechanics, strategy definitely intensifies.\n\n[h1]Oodles of replayability[/h1]\n\nIn addition to unlocking different teams with different abilities that seriously affect the way you play the game, you can purchase upgrades and have to decide how to power them. You can level up your pilots who can die (your mechs keep fighting, but you'll need to find a new pilot to boost their stats). You can choose the island you play on, and which map you play, with different maps having different goals for rewards. Of course, the harder the challenge the higher the reward - and risk.  Even after beating the game, there is a ridiculous amount of replayability here with achievements that reward you with coins that can be spent on unlocking different teams.\n\n[h1]Boo \ud83d\ude31, RNG[/h1]\n\nMy only criticism is like any game with random chance, there is an element of frustrating RNG that can sometimes mar the experience. Although there are no XCOMesque hit chances and you know exactly what you and the enemy will do, the map placement and bonus events can sometimes make playing a perfect (or even good) game feel impossible, especially on the hardest difficulty. On the whole though, I do think that a loss is mostly going to be your own fault. Thanks game, for reminding me that I'm not a tactical genius.\n\n[h1]Unique and Addictive[/h1]\n\nDespite this being heavily advertised as a game from the makers of FTL: Faster Than Light, don't be mistaken into thinking Into The Breach is similar in mechanics. It's a completely different genre and has nothing really similar gameplay wise. What it does have in common is that it's a well-polished unique game that'll keep you playing time and time again. Even when you lose horribly. That's a pretty good thing to have in common!\n\n[h1]It's a highly recommended from me on this one. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f[/h1]\n\n\ud83d\udc96 If you find the reviews of an old Welsh lady interesting, please follow  [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28971565/]My Curator Page[/url] \ud83d\udc96", "timestamp_created": 1521314316, "timestamp_updated": 1521314719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.700169", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40880279": {"recommendationid": "40880279", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989883470", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 957, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 957, "last_played": 1521422092}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic turn based strategy game", "timestamp_created": 1521312808, "timestamp_updated": 1521312808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498339", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40880020": {"recommendationid": "40880020", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960337918", "num_games_owned": 574, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 935, "last_played": 1521662932}, "language": "english", "review": "Into the breach is a game where you try to save the world from Vek insects with 3 mechs at your command. There are total of 24 different kind of mechs available to play, once you have unlocked them all. You unlock mechs by doing steam achievements and this is a clever move by developers. You should think achievements as quests in this game and those quests usually give some hints how to use a particular mech efficiently. Every single mech have different abilities and playing style varies greatly between mech squads.\n\nThe game world is divided to four different islands, which are all infested by Vek creatures. All the islands have different ecosystems, quests, enemies and hazards to deal with. They all feel unique and you have to alter your strategies a bit between islands to survive. Unfortunately one island takes only about 20 mins to complete and replayability is not that great because islands plays almost every playthrough the same. I hope we get a few more island as an update or dlc.   You have to clear two, three or all four islands from veks in order to start the final battle. I have to admit the final battle is my biggest disappointment in this game. I don't want to spoil anything so I just say it doesn't feel any epic at all.\n\nThe basic gameplay is simple: use your 3 mechs with best of your abilities to complete island section's (a mission/level) goals. There are usually 1-3 goals per mission and not everyone is about killing enemies or protecting buildings. There are some great variety about mission goals, but they are island oriented and you repeat same goals many times during playthroughs. Island section is always sized 8x8 square like on a chess board and like on chess game, your mind is the ultimate weapon in this game. Even if island settings feels pretty known after a few game. Every game still feels fresh and fun, because there are some many different mechs with all the different ways you can handle the levels.\n\nIt's hard to review Into the breach without even mentioning Subset games previous game FTL:faster than light. FTL is my in my mind the greatest indie game ever created period. For that reason my and many others hype about this game was off the scale. Currently Into the breach is no on the same level with FTL unfortunately. This game needs more different islands to play and enemies to defeat. The final level also needs a rework, make it more memorable and unique compared to the rest of the island missions. Into the breach is despite it's flaws definitely a good game on it's own merits. Justin Ma and Matthew Davis are also developers that are really commited to their work and I'm almost certain that story of Into the breach is not done yet.\n\n\n10 - Perfect game\n9 - Excellent game, best of the genre\n[h1]8 - Good game, worth your time[/h1]\n7 - Average game, nothing really special\n6 - Bad game, avoid\n5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time\n4 - Failed game, unpayable", "timestamp_created": 1521311997, "timestamp_updated": 1521312028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.727663", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40879761": {"recommendationid": "40879761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005044574", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 310, "last_played": 1521564836}, "language": "french", "review": "Synonyme de la vie", "timestamp_created": 1521311232, "timestamp_updated": 1521311232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40879716": {"recommendationid": "40879716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080941799", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 583, "last_played": 1521472730}, "language": "french", "review": "Le jeu est bon mais manque un equilibrage entre les squads , certaine font pas assez de degats et pour les amelior\u00e9es certaine coutent trop cher en core .\n\nSeul 2 squads sont bien opti , la squad avec le mech au fouet et la squad bas\u00e9 sur l acide , la squad la moins opti c est la team judoka sur le papier ca a l air bon, mais en jeu c est un calvaire .\n\napres ceci est juste mon avis .", "timestamp_created": 1521311092, "timestamp_updated": 1521311092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40878140": {"recommendationid": "40878140", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015587393", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1695, "last_played": 1521679425}, "language": "english", "review": "With Into The Breach (ITB), Subset games just found their way into my list of top five game companies to follow closely.\n\nThey impressed me with FTL. The FTL gameplay and concept were new and innovative, and hyper-efficiently designed and delivered (total file size was under 200 MB), but the presentation fell kinda flat for me. The game was superbly functional but, honestly, boring to look at.\n\nITB shows they learned from that problem. Even though the graphics are a throwback to the pixel era, they are well done and interesting to look at. When playing ITB, I never find my attention waning due to a lack of visual stimulation (which was a problem for me in FTL).\n\nIf you like combat-themed puzzles, you'll enjoy ITB a lot. The game is turn-based, and every scenario (so far) lasts only five rounds. But wow, a lot of thought goes into those five rounds, even on Normal difficulty, as you try to protect your cities, keep your mechs and pilots alive, and complete misison objectives to maximize rewards. It may not sound like it, but that's a lot to try and accomplish in five rounds. In early games I sometimes went into analysis paralysis and rounds lasted 20+ minutes, but after I got the hang of it round duration dropped to 10-15 minutes, making ITB also work as a solid progressive casual game.\n\nAnd last, I have to reiterate how impressive it is that so much fun comes in such a small package.

I guess there are some similarities to chess. Like in chess you need to prioritise what you will be attacking or defending. And like chess you will be able to choose where/who is going to be taking damage. You're going to take damage, you can be sure of that. Whether its a mech getting hitting around, or the power grid getting hit. It will surely happen. So just keep that in mind.\n\nThere is also a little rogue lite element thrown into the mix, as you can choose to save one of your pilots at the end of a game. Win or lose, you can keep one of the pilots. Which does give you an advantage in your next play through.\n\nThere are four different islands to clear, and then the boss level. Each island allows for about 5 regions to be played. Each island is a specific biome. Each region has its own win rewards: Points to be spent; power to be utilised on the mechs; or power, to keep the power grid going.\n\nThe power grid, is like the health meter of your game. When the power is depleted its game over. If you manage to fill the power meter, any additional power gives a chance for an attack on it to be evaded.\n\nEach play through has three mechs. Each has a pilot, but one of the pilots will either be a survivor from a previous game or selected traveller. The travellers have different abilities allowing for different styles to dominate a play through. There are 8 mech squads, 7 of them need to be unlocked as you play through the game. They are all quite different in how they play. Which can be a little confusing when you start out with a new squad.\n\nOne of the biggest plus points for me is that you can play the game in bite-sized pieces. Play one map, or one region. Its up to you. Its something that you can jump into quickly, bash some Vek around, and then go do whatever else you need to.\n\nI've thoroughly enjoyed the game thus far. Its a solid little title.

Atrav\u00e9s de sua progress\u00e3o roguelike, o jogo nos coloca em situa\u00e7\u00f5es de escolha extremamente dif\u00edceis, dentre as quais temos que decidir entre a vida da popula\u00e7\u00e3o que devemos salvar ou a de seus pilotos. Com uma proposta de decis\u00f5es t\u00e1ticas baseadas nos movimentos futuros dos seus advers\u00e1rios, Into the Breach busca trazer combates desafiantes e inteligentes. Ser\u00e1 que o jogo consegue entregar o que promete? Veja nossa an\u00e1lise abaixo:\n\nJogadores de FTL se lembrar\u00e3o de qu\u00e3o desesperador era se encontrar em situa\u00e7\u00f5es que pareciam n\u00e3o ter solu\u00e7\u00e3o. Por mais que pass\u00e1ssemos a maior quantidade de tempo poss\u00edvel buscando sair da enrascada, \u00e0s vezes era praticamente imposs\u00edvel. Into the Breach consegue trazer a mesma sensa\u00e7\u00e3o atrav\u00e9s de um gameplay simples e incr\u00edvel ao mesmo tempo. \n\nO jogo \u00e9 constru\u00eddo na mesma progress\u00e3o roguelike de FTL: Faster Than Light. Temos que percorrer quatro ilhas atacadas pelos Vek, criaturas gigantes em forma de insetos que por alguma raz\u00e3o est\u00e3o atacando a humanidade. Voc\u00ea, como o comandante de um trio de Mechs, deve bolar estrat\u00e9gias em mapas 8x8 gerados de forma rand\u00f4mica com o simples intuito de sobreviver. Temos cinco turnos para evitar que os insetos destruam os Power Grids, estruturas do mapa que se assemelham a pr\u00e9dios cheios de civis. Em um primeiro momento, parece f\u00e1cil de se aguentar meros cinco turnos em um mapa relativamente pequeno, mas, meu caro, Into the Breach exige muito estudo e reflex\u00e3o sobre cada jogada. Um simples movimento errado pode fazer com que voc\u00ea perca o jogo de vez, e, rapaz, como isso \u00e9 frustrante.\n\nTenho certa experi\u00eancia com jogos de estrat\u00e9gia em turno, j\u00e1 que sou um grande f\u00e3 do g\u00eanero (principalmente de XCOM). Agora, se teve um jogo que me fez queimar neur\u00f4nios foi Into the Breach. Sempre estamos em desvantagem num\u00e9rica e, apesar de sabermos os pr\u00f3ximos movimentos dos inimigos, \u00e9 muito dif\u00edcil de se lograr sucesso em defender todos os Power Grids ao longo das quatro ilhas, estas que v\u00e3o se tornando cada vez mais dif\u00edceis. \n\nEm Into the Breach, \u00e9 essencial que se consiga b\u00f4nus de objetivos atrav\u00e9s de Reactor Cores e Reputation. Por meios desses itens, podemos melhorar nossos Mechs com novas habilidades e armas, e isso \u00e9 simplesmente es-sen-ci-al. Por um lado \u00e9 mais f\u00e1cil tentar sobreviver os cinco turnos sem buscar os b\u00f4nus de cada mapa, por outro o jogador fica cada vez mais de m\u00e3os atadas, visto que os inimigos ficam cada vez mais dif\u00edceis enquanto seus Mechs n\u00e3o evoluem. Dessa forma, Into the Breach acaba sendo um jogo de equil\u00edbrio. Em certo momento ser\u00e1 mais prudente perder um Mech, em outro, pode ser que seja melhor evitar ataques aos Power Grids. Tudo depende da situa\u00e7\u00e3o em que somos colocados.\n\nPor falar em situa\u00e7\u00f5es, Into the Breach \u00e9 simplesmente excelente em criar n\u00edveis dif\u00edceis e inimigos que agem com bastante intelig\u00eancia para atrapalhar nossos planos. Durante meu gameplay, tentei procurar por padr\u00f5es de movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o dos Vek nos mapas, mas logo percebi que isso \u00e9 muito dif\u00edcil de se fazer. As a\u00e7\u00f5es dos inimigos s\u00e3o sempre muito inteligentes e, por mais que saibamos o pr\u00f3ximo passo deles, toda a sua estrat\u00e9gia pode mudar quando um novo inimigo surge e resolve prender um dos seus Mechs. Eu gosto de tratar Into the Breach como se fosse um jogo de xadrez da modernidade. As pe\u00e7as t\u00eam movimenta\u00e7\u00f5es e habilidades diferentes que permitem cercar e fazer diferentes estrat\u00e9gias contra os inimigos. Ao mesmo tempo em que tentamos estar um passo \u00e0 frente e frustrar as a\u00e7\u00f5es hostis, temos que nos prevenir contra a\u00e7\u00f5es inesperadas e calcular cada possibilidade para sempre realizar as melhores movimenta\u00e7\u00f5es e decis\u00f5es poss\u00edveis. Cheguei a passar quest\u00e3o de meia hora realizando uma simples a\u00e7\u00e3o, mas o prazer de fazer a melhor jogada \u00e9 incomensur\u00e1vel. O mais incr\u00edvel \u00e9 quando parece que n\u00e3o temos como sair de certa situa\u00e7\u00e3o e milagrosamente pensamos numa solu\u00e7\u00e3o engenhosa. Diferentemente de muitos outros jogos de estrat\u00e9gia em turnos, que t\u00eam a sua dose de sorte, Into the Breach transforma toda a experi\u00eancia em um grande puzzle, j\u00e1 que sempre se sabe de antem\u00e3o quem os Vek atacar\u00e3o, qual ser\u00e1 o dano e em que ordem. Isso d\u00e1 um n\u00edvel de controle maior ao jogo, j\u00e1 que a vari\u00e1vel da incerteza \u00e9 extremamente diminu\u00edda.\n\nPara deixar o jogo ainda mais variado, acumula-se pontos a cada timeline que iniciamos, estes que podem ser trocados por equipes variadas de Mechs. As op\u00e7\u00f5es existentes s\u00e3o muito interessantes, e alteram de forma consider\u00e1vel as estrat\u00e9gias que podem ser utilizadas em cada situa\u00e7\u00e3o. Meu esquadr\u00e3o favorito at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o consiste de um rob\u00f4 que d\u00e1 dano em cadeia atrav\u00e9s de choques, um que puxa inimigos para pr\u00f3ximo de si e outro que arremessa pedras que causam dano e empurram os Vek. A combina\u00e7\u00e3o dos tr\u00eas elementos em muitos momentos \u00e9 mortal, j\u00e1 que temos a possibilidade de eliminar muitos inimigos de uma s\u00f3 vez. \u00c9 praticamente um cheque-mate.\n\nAgora vamos ao momento exalta\u00e7\u00e3o. Into the Breach possivelmente ser\u00e1 lembrado como um divisor de \u00e1guas no g\u00eanero da estrat\u00e9gia em turnos. Isso acontece porque enquanto equipes inteiras demoram para desenvolver puzzles, situa\u00e7\u00f5es e mapas cuidadosamente feitos para apresentar desafios e proporcionar diferentes estrat\u00e9gias de embate, Into the Breach gera de forma rand\u00f4mica cen\u00e1rios que d\u00e3o in\u00fameras possibilidades de combate instantaneamente e de forma magistral. E mais, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 loading! Talvez este seja o momento em que pararemos de encontrar jogos com mapas pr\u00e9-determinados e nos depararemos com mais t\u00edtulos que fazem uso desse tipo de engine. \u00c9 simplesmente genial o que foi feito.\n\nPara fechar a cereja do bolo, Into the Breach traz uma trilha sonora que junto com seus gr\u00e1ficos pixelados e minimalistas, contribuem muito para que apreciemos a beleza do seu design e passemos horas e horas quebrando a cabe\u00e7a tentando chegar at\u00e9 a \u00faltima ilha.\n\nPara aqueles que amam um design inteligente, Into the Breach \u00e9 incr\u00edvel. Para aqueles que amam jogos de estrat\u00e9gia em turno, Into the Breach \u00e9 fenomenal. \u00c9 realmente dif\u00edcil de se encontrar pontos negativos neste jogo, que tem o potencial de mudar a forma como jogos de combate t\u00e1tico s\u00e3o desenvolvidos. Com uma gama de possibilidades enorme e customiza\u00e7\u00e3o de armas e habilidades em um sistema RPG, Into the Breach tem tudo para ser o indie do ano.\n", "timestamp_created": 1521258131, "timestamp_updated": 1521258131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40862845": {"recommendationid": "40862845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063258324", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 506, "last_played": 1521393985}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great follow up game to FTL, Great work to the studio.\nIt's difficult but I love it\nIf they add more islands that'd be amazing.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1521256704, "timestamp_updated": 1521256704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40862613": {"recommendationid": "40862613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062663194", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 243, "last_played": 1521400452}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun strategy game that reminds me of Advance Wars.

A TACTICS GAME??? ALIEN SPIDERS THAT ARE NO JOKE (again)???\n\nI won't mention the story, it's a roguelike, with a pretty high replayability. An 8x8 grid can make you think it's a simple game, but let me tell you this, it is not. Sure, it's not THAT complicated, but there are so many interactions and possibilities, you really gotta think before acting (specially playing hard mode). The game is pretty much like disgaea in the way that when it's your turn you can individually move/act all of your units, and when you pass the enemies make theirs. You can see their intents so you can react OR interact with them. You can make enemies kill each other.\n\nYou can choose a squad (from 7) to play, each one of them is quite unique (except the first one that is the boring nothing-special-learn-the-game-before-playing-blitzkrieg). A squad based on setting everything on fire? Sure. A squad that hurts themselves so they can do more damage and only repair when they kill stuff? Bring it on. Maybe some electricity? You got it. There is even a random mode that will get you a squad using mechs you already have, and a custom one where you can make your own (3 Ice mechs, thank me later).\n\nDuring your run, you'll be able to get more equipament from pods or rewards for doing extra objectives. Each character has their own Energy system, much like FTL you can upgrade stuff and by using more energy, they'll be more powerful, and equipment also use that so you gotta think before using your cores.\n\nAlso, each mech has a pilot, that will level up by killing stuff (or being there while stuff is being killed), and they'll give some upgrades to the mech they're using. You can swap between mechs if you want. There are also pilots that are unique that you gotta unlock by playing and finding them, they all have different dialogues and unique perks, and after unlocking them you can choose them at the start of the game! \n\nAbout difficulties, it is pretty much like FTL. If you're not familiar with tactics game (disgaea, fft, fire emblem, xcom) you may want to start on easy, it's pretty forgiving and you can learn the basics of the game. Normal is a pretty okay challenge, and I believe (it's not confirmed, I do feel that while playing though) that every turn in the beginning is programmed to be possible to beat if you play perfectly, some can take long time for you to realize, but there is a play that you are not seeing. I feel like hard mode is very dependable on your experience not only on the game, but with the squad you're using. I don't think I'll ever be able to beat on hard with zenith or blitzkrieg but I can do that with ease playing Hulks or Hazardous. Hard mode is also extremely punishing. You know tetris? When you make a mistake that line will be there. There will be consequences. If you missplay, you'll get punished real hard. \n\nThe last thing I want to talk about is RNG. FTL is a great game, yes, and I do love it BUT you can be screwed over by random rng (by the way remember how to unlock the crystal cruiser before advanced edition?I still have nightmares about that), but this game all the rng is pretty much \"controlable\". You can choose your route knowing what you'll have to face. Pilots do help and can be game breaking, but by no means you need them to win. Same to equipments, if you know what to upgrade and when, the ones you get later will pretty much be like a win-more. \n\nThe sensation of thinking for 30 minutes about a single round so you can protect everything while killing stuff and then making that play is one of the best things ever. Thinking for 30 minutes about it and then when you make the play you screw up is not. But that makes you learn. By the way, check for yellow glows in ice/mountains. \n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1521253183, "timestamp_updated": 1521253183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603425", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40861117": {"recommendationid": "40861117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038286362", "num_games_owned": 598, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1681, "last_played": 1520903524}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game in desperate need of an expansion.

A \u00fanica coisa que pode amea\u00e7ar a hegemonia de rob\u00f4s gigantes em nossos cora\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o monstros gigantes. Os criadores de FTL conseguiram unir as duas for\u00e7as para um embate mortal que deixar\u00e1 ondula\u00e7\u00f5es no tecido do espa\u00e7o-tempo por eras. Ou pelo menos pelo tempo que voc\u00ea jogar Into the Breach.\n\nSim, \u00e9 um clich\u00ea muito antigo colocar m\u00e1quinas de combate do tamanho de pr\u00e9dios contra \"kaijus\", mas os desenvolvedores desse jogo n\u00e3o apenas n\u00e3o tem receio de apelar para aquele nosso fasc\u00ednio interior pelo tema como tamb\u00e9m guardam algumas surpresas em seu universo e envolvem tudo em uma jogabilidade s\u00f3lida e viciante.\n\nAo contr\u00e1rio do que se pode esperar de uma hist\u00f3ria b\u00e1sica como essa, Into the Breach come\u00e7a com o fim da Humanidade. Os monstros gigantes venceram. Colossais insetos chamados de Vek emergiram das entranhas do planeta, os mares se levantaram, nossa civiliza\u00e7\u00e3o foi reduzida a ru\u00ednas e todos os esfor\u00e7os resultaram em fracassos. Mas um intr\u00e9pido esquadr\u00e3o de pilotos de rob\u00f4s gigantes foi incumbido de uma miss\u00e3o que n\u00e3o pode falhar: retornar ao passado, cancelar o Apocalipse e salvar pelo menos uma linha temporal da trag\u00e9dia.\n\nEmbora o enredo n\u00e3o seja exatamente o foco do jogo, a Subset Games consegue embutir o conceito em sua atmosfera e at\u00e9 mesmo em sua mec\u00e2nica. De um lado, temos a press\u00e3o constante que o exterm\u00ednio est\u00e1 logo ali no horizonte: h\u00e1 o desespero daqueles que moram nas cidades atacadas, h\u00e1 a esperan\u00e7a que aparece quando os rob\u00f4s desembarcam no solo, h\u00e1 uma contagem de baixas civis com cada pr\u00e9dio destru\u00eddo.\n\nDo outro lado, vemos uma elegante solu\u00e7\u00e3o para a tela de fim de jogo e o problema do \"permadeath\": o jogador n\u00e3o fracassa em definitivo. Voc\u00ea salta no tempo para tentar novamente (e \u00e9 \u00f3bvio que voc\u00ea ir\u00e1 tentar novamente), com a possibilidade de salvar pelo menos um de seus pilotos e todas suas evolu\u00e7\u00f5es, para liderar uma nova equipe em outra linha temporal.\n\nDar\u00e1 certo da pr\u00f3xima vez ou a Humanidade estar\u00e1 novamente condenada, enquanto voc\u00ea tenta e tenta, pulando entre universos? Com amea\u00e7as, desafios e recompensas randomizados, a resposta depender\u00e1 apenas do que o pr\u00f3prio jogador aprender e de sua capacidade de entender as t\u00e1ticas do combate e us\u00e1-las a seu favor.\n\nNem mesmo a vit\u00f3ria final e a erradica\u00e7\u00e3o dos Veks significa uma conclus\u00e3o e Into the Breach te convida para novamente escolher um piloto para liderar um novo esquadr\u00e3o em outra linha temporal e repetir essa batalha infinita. Uma batalha infinita entre rob\u00f4s gigantes e monstros gigantes, at\u00e9 o final dos tempos.\n\nNo momento em que os Mechs pousam no solo com estrondo e o povo sa\u00fada sua chegada, voc\u00ea j\u00e1 sabe o que te espera: uma luta de propor\u00e7\u00f5es \u00e9picas. Mesmo com gr\u00e1ficos retr\u00f4 e um mapa que cabe inteiro na tela, Into the Breach tem as propor\u00e7\u00f5es de uma aventura maior que a vida. A trilha sonora injeta a dose certa de adrenalina na hora em que a diferen\u00e7a entre ganhar e perder se torna m\u00ednima, para logo em seguida subir triunfante ou se tornar melanc\u00f3lica e te lembrar que a extin\u00e7\u00e3o da ra\u00e7a humana depende de voc\u00ea, basta uma sucess\u00e3o de decis\u00f5es erradas.\n\nPara vencer em Into the Breach \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio posicionar seus rob\u00f4s nos locais corretos e executar os ataques certos em um combate por turnos que exige muito racioc\u00ednio e escolhas dif\u00edceis. Destruir aquele Vek perigoso ou salvar aquele pr\u00e9dio? Interceptar um tiro e se arriscar a perder um Mech ou permitir que o inimigo destrua uma pe\u00e7a importante de tecnologia enviada atrav\u00e9s das barreiras do tempo? Em cada turno \u00e9 executado um bal\u00e9 de pe\u00e7as similar ao xadrez. Um xadrez com rob\u00f4s gigantes e monstros gigantes, onde \u00e9 poss\u00edvel desferir um murro devastador na cara de um besouro de 10.000 toneladas ou ver com horror centenas de pessoas sendo levadas \u00e0 morte porque um trem bateu em um louva-deus nascido no Inferno.\n\nSuas decis\u00f5es, para o bem ou para o mal, s\u00e3o carregadas ao longo da campanha. Ao todo, o t\u00edtulo apresenta quatro ilhas que precisam ser protegidas da amea\u00e7a Vek, cada um com suas caracter\u00edsticas peculiares. Ao longo da sua travessia, o jogador acumula uma grade de energia necess\u00e1ria para operar os Mechs. Alguns locais salvos ampliam essa grade de energia. Cada pr\u00e9dio destru\u00eddo pelo inimigo reduz essa grade de energia e, se ela chegar a zero, \u00e9 hora de abandonar essa linha temporal e tentar novamente. Ou seja, embora pare\u00e7a se tratar de uma luta para destruir os Veks, a grande verdade de Into the Breach \u00e9 que se trata de um jogo de salvar a Civiliza\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nNo in\u00edcio, voc\u00ea ir\u00e1 perder e perder, at\u00e9 se acostumar com essa dan\u00e7a. E, assim, a Subset Games mais uma vez combina a tem\u00e1tica com a mec\u00e2nica do t\u00edtulo.\n\nGerenciar os recursos fora do campo de batalha, escolhendo miss\u00f5es, administrando pilotos e evolu\u00e7\u00f5es dos rob\u00f4s s\u00e3o t\u00e3o importantes para a vit\u00f3ria quanto as batalhas em si. Com tantas vari\u00e1veis a se considerar simultaneamente, a possibilidade de desbloquear esquadr\u00f5es com habilidades completamente diferentes e miss\u00f5es rand\u00f4micas, Into the Breach compensa a curta dura\u00e7\u00e3o de sua campanha (que pode ser fechada em duas horas) com uma infinitude de universos paralelos a serem salvos.\n\nPor que uma pessoa nunca pode se cansar de rob\u00f4s gigantes enfrentando monstros gigantes.\n\nOriginalmente publicada em [url=http://www.gamerview.com.br/into-the-breach/]http://www.gamerview.com.br/into-the-breach/[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1521230309, "timestamp_updated": 1521230372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614968", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40856218": {"recommendationid": "40856218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022269154", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1193, "last_played": 1521372152}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a great and simple game.

You pick a squad of mechs (and you unlock more squads as you go) and play through a series of somewhat random stages in turn-based tactical battles, where you can see what the enemy is going to do on its next turn.  In the course of a run, you can buy new weapons, upgrade existing weapons, and find new pilots (who gain experience), and with each new run you can carry over an experienced pilot or start fresh with one of the pilots you've unlocked.  You mainly keep playing in order to unlock more pilots and mechs.\n\nMy only real criticism of the game is that each run feels very determined by the squad of mechs you've chosen.

Think Chess crossed with XCOM, without the RNG.\n\nI've heard it described as a strategy game with rogue-like elements. I think that's misleading. I see [i]Into the Breach[/i] as a puzzle game. You play as a group of three giant mechs, tasked with defending (what's left of) the Earth from a crawling, sprawling alien menace called the Vek. The Vek often outnumber and outgun you, but they have one weakness: they are slow. Each turn in-game, the Vek aim for their targets, giving you a chance to respond. All in all the game is about minimising the damage they do to your structures, while killing them off as soon as possible. The game takes place on a 8x8 board; it might sound cramped but there's enough room there and enough mechanics to make a surprisingly deep experience.\n\nEach mission has a different objective: for example, don't take too much damage; defend some NPCs; defend a building, that sort of thing. A few mission types give you extra NPC units to control, or powerful landscape-changing buildings to unleash upon the Vek; these help keep things varied.\n\nGenerally speaking the game is very good at making it clear how the Vek will behave; there are a few occasions where the game hadn't explained this or I'd misunderstood. For instance, an enemy whose sprite faces left (say) will still face left even if they are aiming to fire a projectile to the right; it means you have to look for markers around the enemy rather than the enemy themselves. (I guess the trade off is that you can quickly recognise an enemy by sight.)\n\nIt's very replayable. Similar to FTL, achievements unlock new ways of playing the game, this time in the form of new mech squads. Learning how to play each new squad is rewarding, with little achievements to point you in the right direction. There's a good mixture of easy and hard achievements, so even if you're not planning to complete the game you can still unlock a good number of the squads.\n\nLet me also mention the [url=https://benprunty.bandcamp.com/album/into-the-breach-soundtrack]soundtrack[/url], which does a good job of racking up the tension.

I have cursed this game after a seemingly unwinnable mission (especially the vek hive ones) but after calming, I worked out what I could have done better and I do better next time\n\nWhat is also better than FTL is that that the achievements are, well, more achievable, thus unlocking access to more squads and more strategies\n\nI read in an article on RPS ( https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/03/13/what-developers-think-of-steam-reviews/#more-525263) that only about 1% of people leave reviews and it is more often from those gamers who are unhappy - so here I am letting you all and the developers know\n\nGood game!", "timestamp_created": 1521062794, "timestamp_updated": 1521062794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40816701": {"recommendationid": "40816701", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973332706", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2626, "last_played": 1521508740}, "language": "english", "review": "I suppose I'm writing this to offer a somewhat different perspective from what I'm seeing a lot in the reviews here. There are many who didn't get more than 10 or so hours out of Into The Breach before it lost their interest for various reasons. I'm not here to dispute that their assessment is fair, which I'm sure it is. Rather, I'll just offer what I see roughly 30 hours in so far.\n\nI'm not going to explain the gameplay loop, as you can find plenty of in-depth reviews here. I'll just offer what you can expect concerning late game, replayability, and difficulty.\n\nLate game: for one, you will most likely have unlocked all squads. From there, you'll be working on 3 and 4 island victories for each. All squads also have 3 unique challenges which net you coins to unlock the rest of the secret content. These can be hit or miss, as some can be accomplished just by playing the squad often enough, while others will require you to target them specifically and basically do a throw-away run just to get it. I'm gonna go ahead and guess that accomplishing all of this will take at least 50 hours: as I said, I'm 30 in with a 2-island victory for each squad and most of the challenges completed.\n\nThen you're into free play, where I think ITB is losing a lot of players compared to FTL, and I'm not sure why. Much like FTL, you can start with a squad that plays a specific way, but drastically changes with the discovery of one weapon or passive ability. By selling a mech's starting weapon and equipping a new one, you essentially change their entire playstyle. Sure you're not going to see as many combinations as in FTL, as FTL has hacking/boarding/drone control in addition to their weapon selection and passvies. But I still feel that a run of ITB can be quite varied and unique.\n\nFinally, just a note on difficulty. Many claim that ITB is too easy and not nearly as hard as FTL. In FTL, some runs are unwinnable based on your loadout or if you happen to encounter a ship that you simply can't compete with--if you don't have missle defense, or a way past 3-4 shields yet, etc. The flagship itself is only consistently beatable with a few specific loadouts that either include hacking, boarding, flak, or bombs.\n\nIn contrast, ITB is consistently beatable with any squad. They were designed that way. Sure you may have to sacrifice power ocasionaly, and it may take you a long time to find the right solution. But that IS the essense of this game's difficulty: The fact that sometimes you'll be sitting on one turn for 10-20 minutes until you finally figure out the perfect play. That, to me, is extremely satisfying. And it hasn't gotten old yet. \n\nSo, will you enjoy this game if you liked FTL? I think absolutely. Will you get as much replayability? That's something I can't answer. I think the mechanics are definitely there--I put about 100 hours into FTL + AE when it came out, which I know is paltry compared to what others got out of it. But I can honestly see getting at least that much out of ITB as well.", "timestamp_created": 1521059553, "timestamp_updated": 1521059553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40815963": {"recommendationid": "40815963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005418839", "num_games_owned": 352, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 624, "last_played": 1521134165}, "language": "english", "review": "I've not been able to complete a single run yet but I'm already more than happy to recommend Into The Breach.

But this strategy, turn-based game is unlike many others that share these tags, and, perhaps most importantly, is almost nothing like Subset Games' previous masterpiece, Faster than Light. It is better to approach Into the Breach as a puzzle game, and framed this way, it is a phenomenal title.\n\nThe finely polished systems of Into the Breach are deceptively simple, yet highly rewarding. You control three mechs on a grid trying to fight off the insidious Vek, giant insects that threaten all human life. Positioning is king. Every move the enemy will take on its turn is clearly telegraphed, including the chronological order of each environmental event or enemy action. To protect buildings and complete objectives, you must carefully consider how each action will affect subsequent enemy actions. Blocking enemy fire with your own mech or another enemy, pushing an enemy into an environmental hazard, freezing yourself, choosing between blocking an emerging enemy and destroying a damaged one: all these choices must be juggled in a choreographed dance of mechanized bug murder.\n\nWorld building is passable. The artwork is enjoyable and well-executed for its style, clearly delineating island types according to the corporate flavor. The levels scale to your current progress, and leaders and mech pilots have their own, albeit limited, personalities.\n\nThe soundtrack is composed by the talented, ever-capable Ben Prunty. The ominous, slightly mournful tones of the title screen and strategic map give way to tense, yet upbeat battle tracks, each crafted to match the battle environment.\n\nEven understood as puzzle game though, it\u2019s not perfect. I have my gripes: the grid system\u2014which amounts to a \u201chealth bar\u201d for your run and decreases every time a building is destroyed\u2014feels out of place. In a game that rewards you for perfect positioning, where almost all choices are clearly good or bad, the (usually tiny) chance of randomly negating building damage does little to prevent poor play while failing to reward competence. If you\u2019re playing well, you\u2019ll never need to rely on grid resistance, yet higher grid resistance is often a reward for playing well.\n\nI generally don't enjoy puzzle games, but I managed to get a good 20 hours out of this title, unlocking all but one squad and every pilot (apparently there are secret pilots, but I never saw them). (Perhaps 40% of my \"playtime\" was AFK. Dad life, amirite.) I beat the game on my first run, but I attribute that more to my dabbling with chess than the inherent difficulty of the title. Unless you are gunning for particularly difficult achievements, patient, careful moves will reward you with smooth, near-perfect runs almost 100% of the time.

Much like FTL, Into the Breach is a sci-fi rogue like adventure, although this time, the emphasis is on turn based battles between time traveling mechs and the insectoid aliens called \"Vek\" (and sometimes mech against mech in point of fact). In fact, I would call this something akin to FTL meets Starship Troopers meets Pacific Rim meets The Terminator meets Time Cop. So, how does Into the Breach stack up?\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nThe story, written by Chris Avellone, is quite a bit less substantial than most if not all of Avellone's previous work (Pillar of Eternity, Planescape: Torment, etc...). In fact, he was even the creative director for Fallout: New Vegas. Being one of the great writers in video games doesn't mean you always write full RPG stories though. Into the Breach is more pulpy in nature and the story is fairly lite. Where you really see Avellone's influence more than anywhere else though is with the inclusion of pithy and sarcastic dialogue, such as there is in this game. Although Into the Breach isn't really about story overall, the story is in fact the perfect motivation and I can find no flaws in it outside of the fact that there was an opportunity to really build the story up further than it has been already.\n\nSo, the story features a trio of soldiers from alternate timelines/the future going back in time and traveling timelines with their Pacific Rim sized mechs to fight off the Vek, an alien race of insects that is destroying the world in each timeline. Your goal is to fight them off, find out where the source of the Vek is to found, and destroy their hive. Then on to the next timeline to do it all over again.\n\n8.5 out of 10\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nGameplay in Into the Breach is surprisingly complex. Well, maybe it's not so surprising to fans of FTL. Grid based tactical combat is the order of the day here. The standards are there: a small battle maps featuring enemies, obstacles, traps, and various objectives such as protecting power plants or terraforming a map, killing \"x\" amount of enemies, and so on. Accomplishing the goals set to each region will grant you corporate favor, energy, and power cores (that function as the points for upgrades).\n\nThere are ten different mech units that can be unlocked via finishing timelines and unit objectives, which vary amongst the ten based on their specific skill sets. These give you coins that can be spent to unlock the mech units. You begin with one and will earn the other nine pretty quickly. Their specialties range from specific elemental damage to flight, melee or ranged combat, healing and buffs, etc...and each unit is well balanced with three mechs that (typically) includes a heavy mech, a medium/light mech, and a support mech. You can also create your own custom units using any previously unlocked mech.\n\nEach mech has its own specialty and its skill trees (represented by modifications to the mechs) have two upgrades each (and two modification slots per mech) along with one available upgrade to both health and movement. Health is obvious and is counted in points. Most mechs start with between three to five health and this can be upgraded via modifications as well as the mech pilot's level and attendant buffs.\n\nSpeaking of pilots, these are the time traveling heroes in the game. They can and often do die. Should this happen, and you haven't recruited a new pilot (this is typically either done via the occasional time capsule that will fall onto the battle maps or as an island reward for not failing any region goals), the mech's A.I. will take over until a replacement is found. This is not ideal however as the A.I. doesn't gain experience and abilities. Pilots on the other hand do gain levels (three is the max level presently). Each level comes with a buff that is passed along to the mech, be it extra health, armor bonus, movement bonus, or other abilities. After a timeline is completed, you may choose to take one pilot along with you to the next timeline. this obviously provides you with a bit of a starting bonus as your pilot is already going to be leveled up to some extent if not outright maxed out.\n\nThere are a couple other aspects to the game. You have to maintain energy supplies to power and repair your mechs. If your energy ever falls to zero, you will have failed the timeline and will need to start a new one. Fortunately, you can still take one of your pilots with you if you so choose. You also save people's lives with each region and island you clear, and this essentially functions as a high score leaderboard type thing. Each island is divided into regions, and once you have cleared enough regions of Vek to have three contested areas left, the Vek will surge up and destroy some of the lands you just cleared, culminating in a direct attack to the island's corporate headquarters, which you will have to fend off. This is the boss fight for each island.\n\nYour goal ultimately is to kill off the Vek from each timeline. You accomplish this by clearing \"Corporate Islands\" of the Vek presence. Islands are functionally nations, each with it's own specialty, terrain, regions and government. Each island's CEO functions as your point of contact. You go about the slaughter of Vek through grid based tactical combat maps. It's group turn based (meaning all the Vek will move, then your entire group will go, then any environmental effects will go off, then all the Vek will go, rinse and repeat until the battle is over. There are also a limited amount of rounds available to conquer each region. Once the timer is down to zero, combat stops and any objectives left unfinished are failed. That might seem unforgiving, and on hard difficulty, it is without question incredibly difficult, but the timer itself is generally not an issue unless you've been bogged down in battle and the objectives weren't battle related, and even then, you will generally fall backwards into completing objectives anyway.\n\nI would like to note for y'all that starting with easy and moving up to hard is the way to go. You can still lose on Easy difficulty, but it's better for learning the game mechanics. By the time you get to Hard, you will be fighting/fending off far more enemies, and any mistake you make could potentially cost you the game (and definitely will repeatedly lol), so it's good to have some experience before leaping off the edge into the unknown.\n\nThere are even more aspects to gameplay that I haven't covered here, and that should give you a good indication as to the depth that can be found within.\n\nAll in all, this is a flawless game. No technical issues and perfect gameplay. 10 out of 10\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nThe graphics Into the Breach brings to the table are going to be no surprise to FTL vets either. This is a really nice looking game with very cool animations, nice artwork during the cutscenes, and an overall cool feel to the graphics in general.\n\nA bit pulp, a bit anime-ish, solid isometric imagery....this game does everything well from a graphical perspective. The set pieces look very cool and the actual character designs have a nice, almost watercolor quality to them. This is a visually pleasing game without a doubt. Not groundbreaking, but nice.\n\n8 out of 10\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\n\nThe audio is all ambient and combat oriented outside of the soundtrack itself, which has an almost whimsical, Borderlands/Firefly-esque, mysterious quality to it. Really, really nice and something I personally have not grown tired of at all after fifteen or so hours spent with the game so far. Everything sounds great and there is a solid vibe to the game overall. Unobtrusive but relevant.\n\n9 out of 10\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nWrapped up in the comment section.", "timestamp_created": 1521041241, "timestamp_updated": 1521041241, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552262", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40810718": {"recommendationid": "40810718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028254919", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 906, "last_played": 1521702968}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\u662f\u6559\u79d1\u4e66\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u5f88\u671f\u5f85\u6709\u540e\u7eed\u7248\u672c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u79cd\u73a9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1521040466, "timestamp_updated": 1521040466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40809218": {"recommendationid": "40809218", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999397923", "num_games_owned": 925, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 406, "last_played": 1521375222}, "language": "english", "review": "Into the Breach is a fast, fun turn-based tactics game.

Il doit donc utiliser au mieux ses mechs durant son tour pour contrecarrer les actions de l'ennemi. En fin de tour, l'ensemble des actions de l'environnement et des Veks survivants sont r\u00e9alis\u00e9s dans un ordre pr\u00e9cis.\nIl s'agit donc autant d'un jeu tactique que d'un puzzle game puisqu'il s'agit d'utiliser au mieux ses capacit\u00e9s pour d\u00e9placer les Veks mena\u00e7ants, voire les faire se d\u00e9truire les uns les autres...\n\n[u]Rejouabilit\u00e9 :[/u]\nLes cartes sont g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re proc\u00e9durale (placement des infrastructures, effets environnementaux, types de Veks, etc.) de m\u00eame que les \u00e9ventuels bonus (nouveaux pilotes, armes et \u00e9quippements) que le joueur peut recueillir lors des combats. Ajoutons \u00e0 cela le nombre important (une dizaine) d'escouades de mechs aux capacit\u00e9s diff\u00e9rentes. Le jeu dispose donc d'une grande rejouabilit\u00e9.\n\n[u]Graphisme et ambiance :[/u]\nLes graphismes en pixel art ne sont pas d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ables mais n'ont vraiment rien d'exceptionnel. Il s'agit juste d'un habillage du gameplay, mais il ne se d\u00e9gage aucune r\u00e9elle saveur des graphismes du jeu.", "timestamp_created": 1521032930, "timestamp_updated": 1521032930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40806796": {"recommendationid": "40806796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049186187", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1907, "last_played": 1521654855}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Fant\u00e1stico juego de estrategia por turnos que se siente m\u00e1s como un puzzle en movimiento.

The mechanics and gameplay are not at all like FTL but the general principles are all there. Every game is its own phenom. You CAN get screwed by luck of the draw. Or you might get double-halberds with cloaking + hacking modules and that thingy that lets you fire all weapons on the first turn by the third map (maybe a little less extreme than that but when you win/luck-out big you still win big in this game).\n\nThere is progress even when you lose. You unlock pilots as you play. Each one has interesting 0-level abilities that can sync up very well with the right gear/strategy/etc.\n\nLosing is okay. If it isn't, stay away from this developer. \n\n* Production quality (sound! art!) by the FTL people\n\nOh yes. FTL is superior but it's the same people (I think) and it's awesome.\n\n\n* Front-mission/advance/tactics/block-mover-puzzle-games/something-all-their-own\n\nThere's an almost billiards aspect to this silly simple yet complex tbs 8x8 map game where most attacks move enemies and objects in one direction or another depending on how fancy your equipment is. The AI for a change, can't swim even though your mechs can, so knocking powerful non-boss units into water, glowing-green-sludge/A.C.I.D/etc is deeply satisfying to those of us who died many deaths on the NES for the crime of assuming we could swim.\n\nEvery map gives you a chance to re-try a turn. You will use it. I suspect no matter how good you are, you will use it. And you will love that character that let's you use it twice for a while, until you get better.\n\n* Starts out perhaps underwhelming.

(AKA, it has a lot of the same style as FTL.) It's not FTL, but it's still really good.\n\n\nFor starters, the main gameplay premise is quite interesting. Mixing in [u]time travel themes[/u] into a [u]futuristic near-apocalypse[/u] world with the [i]goal to be preventing the apocalypse[/i] using freaking mechs in [i]as many time lines as possible[/i]. A win or a loss both result in the same outcome, (which is interesting); go back in time to a different timeline and try to save the world again. That gives each playthrough purpose and allows for the whole rogue like idea to be canonical...but it's only sorta rogue like...Prior playthroughs can actually [i]directly[/i] change future playthroughs, as well as the whole usual unlocking more ways to play the game.\n\nNow, each playthrough is pretty short, and you actually get a choice in how long the game plays, as well as what order you play it in (the island mechanic is pretty neat.) Plus it is a [i]bit[/i] easier to reach victory than other rogue likes I have played...but there are tons of different ways to play the game, each set of mechs is totally different, and it would be hard to run out of things to do, even after lots of playthroughs.\n\n\nThe battles themselves are the real gameplay, and for a good game, they have to be pretty cool. There are all types of goals-just a time based victory usually isn't enough to get far with upgrades and all-and you choose what objectives to play on. When in battle, there is a [i]lot[/i] more to work with than the usual turn based combat game. There's tons more to battle than just damaging the bad bugs. You [u]know what attacks they will make[/u], so often its more about [u]preventing[/u] damage to civilian buildings (which are the one thing that losing can lead to a game over-lose all your mechs and the game still goes on! lose all the civilians, and the one run is over) which involves a lot more than just killing them.\n\nYou can move enemies, freeze enemies, reverse enemies, smoke bomb enemies, drown enemies, shield allies, even [i]make enemies attack eachother[/i]...the limits of avoiding damage are all down to your mech kit...and there are a lot of mech kits to unlock, each one with a totally different play style. You only get 3 mechs ion a game, [i]ever[/i], so choose wisely! And find the play style that suits you. The uniqueness of each mech really impresses me.\n\n\nThe game is really deep, so trying to talk about anything in a review would take ages. It's best to see exactly what the game has to offer by playing yourself...but that's all the basics for you.

Think Pacific Rim meets Chess.\n\nThere are three mechs to a squad. Four different classes of mechs. Each mech can have two different peices of equipment some of which is class specific and some which isn't. Each mech gets a pilot, pilots level up with kills and gain extra stats, usually movement, HP, reactor power, or grid defense (% chance damage doesn't harm a building). There are special pilots You can find that have special abilities like moving after you attack or adding extra armor.\n\nAt the end of each run you can pick a pilot to carry on to the next run assuming they are still alive. If a mech is killed the mech is disabled but returns after the battle. The pilot of a destroyed mech is killed.\n\nThere is very little random chance in the combat. Abilities always do what they are supposed to do, attacks never miss, and it makes the combat very strategic and very cerebral. You also have the ability to reset the turn once per fight.\n\nInto the breach is a very entertaining game that took me about 20 hours to finally beat on the hardest setting. Unlocking all the squads was the hard part.\n\nMy only major criticism is that certain mechs (aegis, Jet, Rocket) are really overpowered compared to some of the other mechs which are really weak and practically worthless (Leap, Hook). I'd also mention that since the game has so many movement based abilities there should really be more environmental hazards as so many squads focus on moving the enemy around it's really hard to finish the game with them when there are so many maps that just don't give them a chance to actually kill anything.

No, but the game gets repetitive. The way the game is organized is similar to FTL except with islands instead of sectors. The gameplay is quite different then FTL though. Into the breach is more like a chess game except with only 3 pieces under your command. This makes the game more of a mind game but with only 3 pieces there are very few moves you can make. On top of that there is very little randomness so once you come up with a way to solve the problem you don't have to worry about it failing (FTL used the miss mechanic and real time engagements to counter this). It doesn't help that there is very little enemy unit variation. The game is also rather easy I only lost once which was my first time; I think this is because of the lack of randomness so you just have to do the math and end the turn. \nEdit: The game also lacks the mystery and exploration that made FTL so good and entertaining.", "timestamp_created": 1520975108, "timestamp_updated": 1521151121, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567405", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40795872": {"recommendationid": "40795872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002306207", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 783, "last_played": 1521327066}, "language": "english", "review": "This is not FTL.

I beat the game with the Zenith Squad. The only thing I got from the store the whole game was a gun for my tank, so that it could have more than just ramming bugs as its only attack.

Lol!  The are just some things that most AAA games can't even come close to the fun factor or replayablity of a game like this.  The game AI is very good, the music is superb and after a run, you just want to jump right in for another to see what else you can unlock or conquer.

If you just want to see the credits roll, it's not gonna be that long.\nI finished my first (successful) playthrough in about 5 hours, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. \nThere are so many unlockables that it would take a lot more than that to get 100% completion.\n\n[h1]Comparison[/h1]\nIt feels like [b]FTL[/b] had a baby with a very simplified version of [b]XCOM[/b] and a procedurally generated game of chess. With mechs and giant bugs instead of pawns.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe human kind has been destroyed by an infestation of alien creatures known as Vek. As a last resort a group of mechs is sent back in the time to try and prevent the final destruction of the world. You gain control of three machines and their commanders in an attempt to try and defeat the aliens before it's too late.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nIt's an isometric tile-based pixel-art goodness, simplistic in nature, but that works well here.\nIn most cases it's pretty clear what's going on and what's about to happen, but once or twice I haven't noticed a field that was a target of an enemy attack, because it was obstructed by something else.\nAnother thing worth mentioning is the lack of proper movement and attack animations. Units just teleport from tile to tile, and during attacks a projectile is shot from their position, but they just stand there unaffected. \n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe soundtrack by [b]Ben Prunty[/b] is really good. If you enjoyed music in [b]FTL[/b], you'll have a good time with this one too. You can check it out on [url=https://benprunty.bandcamp.com/album/into-the-breach-soundtrack]Ben's Bandcamp[/url].\n\n[h1]Mechanics[/h1]\nNicely done, almost everything working smoothly and exactly how I expected. One exception - when you're spending reputation and buying things, some items are limited to a specific mech type and you might not remember which is which. To check you have to click out of the shop, then click into a specific mech to check it's type. But that's a tiny inconvenience.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThere are 4 islands that need defending, each split into 8 regions, so in theory that's 32 missions + the final fight in every playthrough. But that's not really the case. On each island one region is safe at the beginning and then acts as a mini-boss fight location. You get to that after completing 4 other selected regions. The remaining 3 are permanently lost, so you have to choose wisely, depending on which rewards you want more.\nOnce the mini-boss is defeated, an island is secure. When you secure 2 islands, you can attempt the final mission, or continue securing other islands. The difficulty is increased with each secured island, so the final fight is easier with just 2 islands completed and harder if you've secured all 4. It's completely up to you. That's between 10 and 20 missions (+ final fight) per playthrough.\nThe main part of the game is all about fighting aliens. Each fight takes place on an 8 by 8 tile grid, three of your mechs fight against a number of enemies. It's turn-based and all Vek attacks are telegraphed - you know where they will attack in their next turn. So what you have to do is prevent them from completing those attacks. You can push or pull them onto another tile, where they can drown, get burned, fall off the map, get in the line of fire of another Vek or simply miss their shot. You can also punch, shoot, bomb or slam into them, causing damage and destroying them. There's a lot of ways to win, with different mechs, weapons or tactics. You have to constantly adjust to the enemy types, the environment or a specific scenario. \nEach mission will offer some bonus objectives which, if met, will grant you additional rewards. For protecting a train, taking minimum damage, destroying a water dam, killing a number of enemies or preventing them from spawning you can get additional reputation (currency), reactor cores (mech upgrades) or additional grid power (that's what's keeping your mechs operational - you lose when it gets to zero).\nYou start the game with only one squad of mechs available. Playing with each squad sets 3 goals for you. Completing each goal (which are also achievements) gives you coins that can be used to unlock additional squads. You'll need to unlock 30 achievements to get access to all 8 squads.\nThere are 3 difficulty levels - Easy, Normal and Hard. While [i]easy[/i] in FTL wasn't that easy, here it is just that. But if you like a challenge, normal and hard will offer it to you. From what I can tell, there's just one achievement related to the difficulty level (beat the game on hard), others can be achieved on any difficulty. \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe developers put themselves in a very awkward position. Every promotional material for this game shouted: [b]\"From the makers of FTL\"[/b].\nOn one hand, after that, there is no way to avoid the obvious comparison. Is it as good as [b]FTL[/b]?

Lo que queda de la humanidad lucha por sobrevivir ante el incansable embate de los vek, una especie de insectos alien\u00edgenas y gigantes que, tras conquistar el subsuelo del planeta, planea hacer lo propio con su superficie.\n\nA los mandos de un escuadr\u00f3n de tres mechas enviados desde el futuro, somos lo \u00fanico que se interpone entre la vida y la muerte, el \u00faltimo recurso de un planeta que ya no puede so\u00f1ar con un ma\u00f1ana mejor, sino que se conforma con no perder lo que le queda del presente.\n\nSobre esta base, Subset Games construye el eterno retorno a una guerra que atraviesa infinitas l\u00edneas temporales, un recurso al servicio de un doble uso, pues sirve de base para la construcci\u00f3n de ese status quo de perennidad, al tiempo que justifica el funcionamiento c\u00edclico de sus partidas. Esta es una guerra que se enfrenta al estilo Simeone, partida a partida, y cuyas victorias son peregrinas, puntos y seguido relativamente in\u00fatiles, pues el final de cada despliegue coincide, ni m\u00e1s ni menos, que con el inicio del siguiente.\n\nPese a que las fichas que uno maneja no dejan de ser enormes veh\u00edculos tripulados y armados hasta las trancas, sobrevivir en Into the Breach es una cuesti\u00f3n m\u00e1s de ma\u00f1a que de fuerza. La cantidad de variables que uno debe manejar en cada ronda es considerable: tipos de terreno, estados alterados, posiciones relativas, climas adversos y catacl\u00edsmicos, alcances de movimiento, la lista es extensa. En conjunto, todos estos elementos convierten la experiencia en algo que tiende m\u00e1s al puzle que a la pura estrategia, pues ser\u00e1n numerosas las ocasiones en que habremos de pensar no s\u00f3lo en el turno corriente sino en los que le sigan.\n\nLa estructuraci\u00f3n de Into the Breach en torno a la repetici\u00f3n no solo se limita al tiempo, sino que tambi\u00e9n organiza su espacio. El territorio se concibe aqu\u00ed a partir de tres escalas diferentes: las cuatro islas que componen lo que queda de su mundo, las regiones en las que se divide cada isla y el tablero de 8\u00d78 casillas que las transforma en escenario de combate. Conquistar cualquiera de estos pedazos no es sino la v\u00eda hacia el siguiente, un suma y sigue hasta el enfrentamiento final con los vek.\n\nDicha conclusi\u00f3n se desbloquea desde el momento en que se supera la primera isla, y pese a que la dificultad de Into the Breach se adapta autom\u00e1ticamente al nivel del escuadr\u00f3n, para las primeras tentativas de enfrentarla lo recomendable es visitar todas las regiones posibles para hacer acopio de recursos, armas y experiencia, en el amplio sentido de la palabra.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, cada una de las islas cuenta con su propia personalidad e idiosincrasia, por lo que no es hasta que se superan todas que se puede tener una imagen completa de lo que Subset Games han fabricado a partir de un pu\u00f1adito de detalles.\n\nSiguiendo casi un modelo cl\u00e1sico, hay regiones verdes y boscosas, otras cubiertas de hielo y nieve, unas \u00e1ridas y des\u00e9rticas y algunas industriales y cubiertas de mares \u00e1cidos. Todas ellas se presentan como naciones controladas por corporaciones y sus CEOs, que en la suave distop\u00eda de Into the Breach han sustituido a los gobiernos populares en su intento por organizar la resistencia.\n\nDestaca en esta l\u00ednea, tambi\u00e9n, c\u00f3mo var\u00eda el dise\u00f1o de las edificaciones seg\u00fan se avanza por el t\u00edtulo, desde los prismas de hormig\u00f3n que tachonan los valles de Archive INC., hasta los edificios champi\u00f1\u00f3n que se elevan sobre las estepas heladas de PInnacle Robotics, o c\u00f3mo var\u00edan los retratos de sus personajes para ofrecer un abanico de arquetipos que va desde veteranas oficiales hasta inteligencias artificiales superdesarrolladas.\n\nPara llevar a cabo tan magno cometido, deberemos repartir fuego y furia a nuestros enemigos a trav\u00e9s de peque\u00f1as escaramuzas por turnos, siempre bajo el mismo esquema funcional: un grupo de veks emerge en algunas de las casillas de los tableros de 8\u00d78 en que se dividen los escenarios de combate, amenazando tanto a los edificios residenciales en los que se acinan los humanos supervivientes como el objetivo principal de turno. Como contramedida, desplegamos nuestro tr\u00edo de guerreros en casillas de nuestra elecci\u00f3n y que comience la fiesta del ob\u00fas y el servopu\u00f1etazo en la boca.\n\nA ello tambi\u00e9n contribuye un selector de dificultad tan honesto como inmisericorde. El modo f\u00e1cil es ideal para hacerse con las din\u00e1micas b\u00e1sicas del t\u00edtulo y experimentar el ef\u00edmero sabor de la victoria. En normal, uno empieza a comprender que no la cosa no trata tanto de cu\u00e1nto terreno puedes quitarle a los vek como cu\u00e1nto puedes evitar que te arrebaten. Jugar en dif\u00edcil es, directamente, un acto de fe, y cada p\u00edrrico triunfo se siente como un hito de estrategia marcial.\n\nAvanzar a l\u00edneas temporales m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles, adem\u00e1s, devuelve consecuencias progresivamente m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles de asumir. La lista de pilotos ca\u00eddos en combate va extendi\u00e9ndose sin apenas poder evitarlo, algo terrible tanto narrativamente \u2014al fin y al cabo, est\u00e1s perdiendo un compa\u00f1ero\u2014 como mec\u00e1nicamente, pues el sustituto, si lo hubiera, ser\u00e1 un pipiolo al lado de la veteran\u00eda del ca\u00eddo.\n\nEn conjunto, cu\u00e1nto m\u00e1s complejo se hace todo m\u00e1s distancia se crea entre jugador y conflicto, hasta llegar a entender la crudeza de una guerra que hay que ganar a toda costa y en la que nada ni nadie es prescindible. Queda el consuelo, eso s\u00ed, de que tras cada derrota lo \u00fanico que espera es una nueva reiteraci\u00f3n, una oportunidad m\u00e1s de meterse en la cabina de los mechas y caer desde los cielos sobre unos vek que no conocen, ni conocer\u00e1n jam\u00e1s, un \u00e1pice de tregua.", "timestamp_created": 1520939888, "timestamp_updated": 1520939888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621040", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40783648": {"recommendationid": "40783648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060683339", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 518, "last_played": 1520933901}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun little puzzle/turn based SRPG type mash-up.\n\nWould've been great if it were expanded with larger map/squad size but for $15 I have no complaints.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1520934844, "timestamp_updated": 1520934844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40783165": {"recommendationid": "40783165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006941734", "num_games_owned": 365, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2106, "last_played": 1521481472}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uba38\ub9ac \uad74\ub9ac\uba74\uc11c \ud558\ub294\uac8c \uc7ac\ubc0c\uae34\ud55c\ub370 \n\ub2e4\ud68c\ucc28 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uc2eb\uc5b4\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc740 \uc0ac\uc9c0 \ub9c8\uc138\uc694\n\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9ac\uba38\ub791 \uce5c\uad6c \ubc29\uc1a1 3\uc2dc\uac04\uc815\ub3c4 \ubcf4\uace0 \uc81c\uac00 \uc0ac\uc11c \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud574\ubd24\ub294\ub370\n1\uc2dc\uac04\ub9cc\uc5d0 \uc5d4\ub529 \ud55c\ubc88 \ubcfc\uc218 \uc788\ub354\ub77c\uace0\uc694", "timestamp_created": 1520932373, "timestamp_updated": 1520932373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40782939": {"recommendationid": "40782939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004698559", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 961, "last_played": 1521478632}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a so so game not  bad but not good ether. easy is normal, normal is hard and hard is impossible.thats how i rate the dificolety  the rng is the same as ftl it can scrue you over like it do most of the time endet up lusing cos of rng. havent  won ones out of the hours i played", "timestamp_created": 1520931280, "timestamp_updated": 1520931280, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.362438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40782862": {"recommendationid": "40782862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047630550", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 915, "last_played": 1521016544}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved the game and it has a great price.\nI highly recommend plaing Into The Breach.", "timestamp_created": 1520930938, "timestamp_updated": 1520930938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40782251": {"recommendationid": "40782251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094693797", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2539, "last_played": 1521595819}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has no right to be this good.

You've got to hand it to them for using their FTL money to do what they wanted to do as game developers instead of raking in even more dollars with FTL 2: Electric Boogaloo. What money they did have was used well, because Into the Breach is a good time.\n\n\nGameplay can be described as a pseudo-puzzle mixture of chess and Ironman XCOM, except you can have a mech pilot [i]travel back in time[/i] and try again in an alternate timeline if a game goes pear-shaped. You'll doom Earth in that timeline to giant voracious insects, yeah, but you might be able to save it in the next one. The chess parallels become more evident on closer inspection: battle maps are 8x8 just as chess boards are, your mechs and the Vek are initially positioned similarly to how white and black chess pieces are, and just like white, the Vek always move first.\n\nOn the other hand, chess doesn't let you do stuff like customize piece placement, upgrade and level up pieces, or [i]travel in time[/i]. There's no diagonal movement, but since mechs and Vek have health you can bodyblock attacks if needed, as well as shift most Vek around with your attacks - that aspect's more like billiards than chess. The savant-like memorization typical of high level chess isn't needed here, since there's no one board/piece arrangement to memorize potential movesets for, and the Vek's next moves are always telegraphed in advance.\n\nThere's also a strategic element in that you can choose different missions with different rewards based on what you need more, and mission/island choice ought to consider how well your particular mech squad would handle them. Mistakes...or cold-hearted triage...on the battlefield can influence what rewards you go for, and mech upgrades can open a lot more possibilities. Different pilots for your mechs can even be unlocked, with differing abilities.\n\nAchievements grant in-game coins, which are used to unlock new mech squads with differing playstyles - that's a pretty interesting incentive for achievement hunting that I don't see many games doing like Into the Breach does. Perhaps most importantly, the game avoids almost all the unfair random chance that marred FTL, and has a much more fairly designed final battle.\n\nIf I had to make a criticism, I kind of wish battlefields were bigger, and possibly with more mechs to use. At the same time though I recognize how the interconnectedness of the other mechanics somewhat depend on the limited size. The game would also lose some of its cool chess-like qualities if it had bigger maps.\n\n\nThe overall result is an elegant and very satisfying example of turn-based tactics, especially when you're able to come up with a clever plan for a turn to get out of a tight spot. The tension that develops when more Vek spawn and complicate your plans, on the other hand, is an effective counterweight. The game is playable in bursts or in long stretches, so you needn't dedicate hours at a time if you don't want to - and good thing too, because resolving tricky battlefield situations can get taxing after a while.\n\nIt's all the more impressive when you consider it was mainly developed by two guys; Chris Avellone as writer meanwhile is a different kind of impressive and adds just the touch the game's setting needs. It helps style-wise that the graphics are as polished as they are. Ben Prunty also returns to deliver another great [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/807320]soundtrack[/url] that enhances the experience.\n\nI definitely recommend this if you're into turn-based games or chess, and if you liked FTL or like things with giant mechs in them, you ought to at least try it.\n\n\nAlso the initial time-traveling pilot available to new players resembles LazyTown actor Stef\u00e1n Karl Stef\u00e1nsson.

The various mechs add variety, but the enemys are always the same, and after a few runs you end up always bumping in the new upgrades. This is way different from FTL where there were so many upgrades to choose from. \n\nThe game design is excellent, and usually you can get at a glance what is happening on the board. In case you misinterpret something, there's a \"reset turn\" feature but it's very poorly designed in my opinion. It cannot be used once the \"end turn\" button has been punched, and it happened to me quite often that I realized I did a very, very stupid mistake right after the end of my turn. In this case, you can jump on Alt+F4, and if you're lucky you'll return to where you were. Moreover, there's a confirmation feature in case you end your turn with remaining actions, but not if you're going to stupidly fail an objective or lose a mech. In my opinion, the \"reset turn\" feature should remain active while the current turn is being resolved. Apart from this little thing which made me rage-quit ongoing quite a few times, I really enjoy this game so far!\n\nThere are also a few design problems with some teams for example there's a type of enemy which has plenty of hit-points a powerful attack and will go underground if you hit it, but the fire behemoth have no way at all to hit it (the only way is to combine the artilery attack to set it on fire and then the flamethrower attach to actually damage it). With some other teams (eg the default team), all three attacks will damage this enemy. I'm sure those small balance issues will be fixed in the future.\n\nThe music is great but a little bit repetitive as well, and I ended up turning it off.\n\nOverall, a great game that I definitely recommend! I hope that future updates will add additional content, but at the current price tag the game is definitely worth a buy!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1520882200, "timestamp_updated": 1520882200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40771354": {"recommendationid": "40771354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047342065", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 218, "last_played": 1520968180}, "language": "english", "review": "This game does soem very neat things after you get used to it.", "timestamp_created": 1520881581, "timestamp_updated": 1520881581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40771098": {"recommendationid": "40771098", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974474670", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1756, "last_played": 1521210379}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the exact level of polish and replayability that  FTL offered.

So oder so \u00e4hnlich kann man das neue Spiel der FTL-Macher beschreiben. Dabei haben die hochh\u00e4user-gro\u00dfen Insekten namens Vek die Menschheit bereits vernichtet. Doch die Menschheit hat eine Geheimwaffe. Mithilfe von Zeitreisen schickt Sie immer wieder riesige Kampfmaschinen (Mechs) los um die Zeitlinie zu korrigieren und falls die totale Vernichtung droht, begibt sie sich zur\u00fcck \"Into the Breach\". \n\nDas Spiel vergibt keine Fehler. Speichern ist nicht. Eine Entscheidung wie ein unbedachter Angriff, kann nicht ohne weiteres zur\u00fcckgenommen werden. Dies machte auch den Reiz bei FTL aus und wird auch bei \"Into the Breach\" fortgef\u00fchrt. Zwar kann man Bewegungsaktionen r\u00fcckg\u00e4ngig machen, sobald allerdings eine Aktion ausgef\u00fchrt wird, war es das. Einzig ein tempor\u00e4rer Zeitsprung kann eine v\u00f6llig misslungene Runde r\u00fcckg\u00e4ngig machen. Diesen sollte man aber mit Bedacht einsetzen, denn in jeder Mission ist dies nur einmal m\u00f6glich.\n\nW\u00e4hrend das Spiel \u00e4hnlich wie FTL innerhalb von etwa 1,5 h +/- komplett zu schaffen ist, kann man immer wieder spielen um weitere Einheiten und Piloten freizuschalten. Durch Erfolge und Errungenschaften verdient man sich M\u00fcnzen um andere Teams gegen die Vek ins Feld zu schicken. Die Teams sind immer zu dritt und jedes Team hat eine eigene Strategie, an die man sich zum Teil erst gew\u00f6hnen muss. Von schildbewehrten Mechas, hinzu wettermanipulierenden Flugzeugen, Eispanzern, Wissenschaftsfahrzeugen, Steinewerfern, Hakenkanonen, Feuerk\u00e4mpfern, Nahkampfeinheiten und Blitzpeitschen gibt es hier eine ganze Bannbreite von kreativen Ideen und Spielweisen.\n\nEin Manko gegen\u00fcber FTL, sind die fehlenden Entscheidungsm\u00f6glichkeiten und auch die zum Teil geheimen Missionen und die M\u00f6glichkeit innerhalb des Spiels Dinge zu entdecken. Hat man das Spiel einmal geschafft, spielt man immer wieder die gleichen Missionen auf vier verschiedenen Inseln. Diese sind zwar immer leicht abgewandelt und die Karten \u00e4ndern sich nat\u00fcrlich auch leicht, aber im Grunde ist es dasselbe. Das Einzige was sich \u00e4ndert sind die Mechs und die damit verbundene Spielweise. Damit fehlt dem Spiel ein wichtiger zufallsbasierter Aspekt.

So instead of boring old chess, this game is basically roided up, extremely fun, super rewarding, and immersive [b]CHESS[/b].\n\nA similar theme that this game also follows in terms of FTL is it's difficulty and learning curve.

I dislike Into the Breach for a few different reasons and I will elaborate a bit. First the devs put \"From the makers of FTL\" on this game. While obviously they are it leads many people to compare the games including myself. A lot of people on the forums are defending it and asking \"how can you compare such games?\" The fact the devs put that line on this game is asking for them to be compared. Also they are both rogue-likes in a sense because Into the Breach does have a lot of random elements to it as well. In both games you progress through \"maps\"(islands vs. Solar Systems), in both games you unlock things permanently as you progress, in both games enemies spawn randomly, etc. So having said this comparing this game to FTL it is way shorter, and has WAY less replayability and content to it than FTL. That alone is enough to make me not want to recommend this to others considering your paying the same price as FTL was.\n\nMoving on to another point. This game is fun at times, and don't get me wrong,  the devs did a great job with balancing it. But it is a puzzle game which is not really my cup of tea so to speak. I do enjoy them ocasionally but never go out of my way or buy things because they are puzzle related. So I will keep playing this rarely, but honestly I grew bored of it after a few hours already so am taking a break. Do not buy this game if you dislike puzzles obviously or if you find them boring as that is all this is. There is not much tactics or anything of the sort involved since you can see where the enemies will move and what they will attack each turn before you even get a chance to move. While that is an interesting concept it makes the game grow stale a lot quicker in my honest opinion. \n\nThe campaign is way to short. The maps are very small grids. There is not much to unlock, and I don't really have much motivation to unlock any other squads either. The first squad you get is literally one of the best in the game, so there is not much progression to even really be had looking at it this way. They almost went backwards here. Instead of progressing to make things easier you progress to make it harder. Other squads just add varying challenges to the game basically. In FTL you would strive to unlock that next ship or version b, or c, etc to try and get further and further till you can beat it. There was just so much more depth and personality to FTL than this game so I simply cannot recommend this unless some dlc releases or some content actually patched in to make it harder. Which brings me to my last point. \n\nThe game is way to easy with the starting squad. If you are good or even decent at puzzles you can beat this game quickly since that is pretty much all there is to it. It is lacking harder enemy types, bosses, and dynamics during missions to really challenge the player as FTL did.\n\nI really wanted to enjoy this, and was hoping for more from these developers since they made one of my favorite games of all time, but was ultimately let down sadly.

These may be 2 games by the same developer, but that's where similarities end.\n\nInto the Breach is a turn-based tactics system that's fairly unique in that it is designed for short play sessions.\nYou'll be fighting over 2 to 4 islands before going into a final battle, where on each island you'll be fighting for 5 out of 8 territories. And battles last only 4 or 5 turns. If a full campaign takes more than 2 hours, it's because you're really taking your time.\n\nThe base mechanics are relatively simple: Aliens invade and take a turn moving and setting up their attacks, then you move your mechs to kill those aliens, or to reposition them so they don't hit important targets. Where important targets include civilian buildings and special buildings that cost grid points when lost (and running out of grid means losing the campaign), special units such as trains that need protecting, and lastly your own mechs.\nThen aliens deal their damage and bring in reinforcements, and the next turn starts.\nThis all happens on a small 8x8 board, where you'll have 3 units active at the same time.\n\nTo add variety to those basics:\n- You'll be unlocking a total of 8 different Mech squads, each with their own unique playstyle. You can also build a custom squad using any mechs from any squad, or go with a random squad.\n- You'll be finding and unlocking other time travellers to pilot your mechs. You start each campaign with one of those, and 2 generic troopers. All pilots will gain experience levels and get randomized bonuses when they do, in addition the Time travellers all have a unique ability of their own. Picking the right pilot for your squad can make all the difference too.\n- While missions all have the same basic objective of simply surviving long enough, and a number of different objectives on top of that that give rewards: extra grid points, reputation points that you can spend on gear after completing an island, or extra power cores to upgrade your mechs.\n- Each island also has a specific flavor, with different types of hazards being added to the maps.\n\nThe depth in the gameplay comes from understanding how your squad of choice works, which enemy does what, how you can turn enemies on each other and (often enough) what to sacrifice where in order to still meet your objectives. Or maybe you'll need to sacrifice an objective to ensure your grid stays up.\n\n\nAll this is wrapped up in a basic time travel plot, where as the last survivor of the alien invasion you can go back a few weeks and see if you can turn the decisive battles around in favor of humanity (and their allied AIs).\n\nThe game is not without it's flaws though. \n- Outside of combat, there really isn't much to do apart from making sure you go on missions you actually have a good chance of completing, and how you upgrade your mechs. (more power, extra weapons)\n- And while there are enough different maps to fight over, there aren't too many different objectives to be seen per island. So the game does get repetitive from that angle.\n- Unlocks are also dependent on spending coins, which are earned by getting achievements. While the achievements aren't bad in themselves as they are designed to teach to the tricks of a squad, or of the game in general, this does seem a bit flavorless. It would also support the backstory more that some of the squads would be unlocked by completing specific islands etc.\n\nIn closing:\nInto the Breach is certainly a very good game, ideal for playing in short bursts, and with a strong core gameplay loop. For that, it's well worth the asking price. \nJust don't expect much outside of that core gameplay, because that's where it falls short.", "timestamp_created": 1520803841, "timestamp_updated": 1520803841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40751746": {"recommendationid": "40751746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005742397", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1130, "last_played": 1520800243}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430. \u0412 \u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438, \u0437\u0430\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439. \u041a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0443\u043c\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0434 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u044b\u043c \u0445\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0431\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044b\u043c \u0441\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043c. \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432, \u043d\u043e \u0435\u0451 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u0437\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u044e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u0427\u0435\u0433\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f \u0438 \u0436\u0434\u0430\u043b \u043e\u0442 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432 FTL. \u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f FTL, \u0442\u043e \u0438 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e. \n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1520802176, "timestamp_updated": 1520802176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40749492": {"recommendationid": "40749492", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982659389", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 703, "last_played": 1520835182}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!\nTons of replay value as there are many mechs to unlock and then choose from.\n\nFTL is a great game and I had to see what this was all about.

Do you like Advance Wars?  Do you like short sessions of interesting, semi-random but well designed and replayable turn based strategy with a meta game and advancement that doesn't make you want to claw your eyeballs out?\n\nThis game is for you.\n\nI was surprised by Into the Breach.  It's balanced to an incredible degree with a lot of RNG removed and replaced with intelligent design that plays into being strategic.  But, if you screw up, the sessions are at max an hour to an hour and a half, so no big deal, start another one.  It is a game that perfectly incapsulates a one more turn style of play.  There are eight teams of very different mechs unlocked as you complete game achievements, but you purchase them with coins you get from achievements, so you can choose who you want to play around with as you go.  More to the point, the combat, while a bit minimalist in some places is smart, has a huge number of variables that can go into gameplay, and offers nice twists on objectives beyond kill all enemies. Also, the meta is really well built, as you gain coins to buy mechs across both single sessions and multiple playthroughs and you can carry over your best pilot from your previous one to give your next run a much needed boost.\n\nI love this game.  My biggest gripes are the story is a bit meh, it's fine for what it is but more would have been cool.  Also, you can get a secret squad of mechs which costs as much as all the others combined...and it's really lame.  Stick with the base eight. \n\nThis game rocks and I'd recommend it to anyone with a love of mechs and turn based strategy RPGs.", "timestamp_created": 1520778457, "timestamp_updated": 1520778457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40740477": {"recommendationid": "40740477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028724819", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 890, "last_played": 1521215764}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uaf64 \uc798\ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5c8\ub2e4\n\ub85c\uadf8\ub77c\uc774\ud06c \uc7a5\ub974 \ud2b9\uc720\uc758 \uc6b4\ube68\uc774 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud074\ub9ac\uc5b4\uc5d0 \uc9c0\uc7a5\uc744 \uc904 \ub9cc\ud07c\uc740 \uc544\ub2c8\ub2e4 \n\uc11c\uc21c\uacfc \ud0ac\uac01\uc744 \uc7a1\ub294 \uc13c\uc2a4\uac00 \uc911\uc694\n\uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ub9de\uc744\ub550 \ub9de\uc544\uc8fc\ub294 \uacfc\uac10\ud568\uc744 \uac16\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\uba74 \n\ud074\ub9ac\uc5b4\uac00 \uc5b4\ub835\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4\n\n\uc544 \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud50c\ub808\uc784 \ubca0\ud788\ubaa8\uc2a4 \uacc4\uc5f4 \uc57c\ud3ec \uc5c5\uae00\uc5d0 2\ub51c \ucd94\uac00\ud558\ub294\uac70 3\ub9ac\uc561\ud130\ub098 \uc8fc\uace0 \ucc0d\uc744\ub9cc\ud07c \uc88b\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\uc740\ub4ef\n\uac74\ubb3c\uc774\ub791 \uc544\uad70\ud55c\ud14c\ub3c4 2\ub51c \ub4e4\uc5b4\uac00\ub294\uac8c \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud788 \uac70\uc2ac\ub9ac\ub354\ub77c", "timestamp_created": 1520773295, "timestamp_updated": 1520773434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40740143": {"recommendationid": "40740143", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971571062", "num_games_owned": 1950, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 1920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 702, "last_played": 1521422133}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1]Insta-Cl\u00e1sico[/h1]\nEl nuevo juego de Subset Games es una verdadera maravilla.

Having full-cleared the game [not all victories] win just about 19 hours, I can strongly, STRONGLY, reccomend this game. At 15$ with a free copy of FTL to play or give away, this game is utterly phenominal from a value perspective and has a way of making you want to play more and more of it, it may be a VERY hard game at times, but overcoming that challenge is made immensely satisfying every single time I've gotten it on normal difficulty or higher. Overall I'd put it at an 8.5 or 9 /10, it's a truly lovely game with a huge amount of heart, soul, and dedication put into every aspect.

The fundamentals of Into The Breach border on perfection, but unfortunately the game is too afraid of muddying the clarity of its mechanics to stray much further beyond fundamentals. What is in the game is almost perfect, but I cant help but think of what they sacrificed for such simplicity. It makes the game very accessible to a large audience, but those who love what they see will claw past the immaculate surface and be disappointed to find that there's just not much else beneath. Into The Breach has only one major flaw, and that is there isnt more of it.\n\nThe main factor that enhances replayability is your squad of mechs, of which there are nine, for a total of twenty-seven mechs. This means you will have nine playthroughs of the game that feel relatively fresh. That's a decent amount of content, around eighteen hours worth. And it doesnt count the amount of time you spend unlocking the new squads either. You'll be playing through the same four islands, with the same mission types, with the same final mission. But the abilities of your mechs will ensure that you tackle all these missions in completely different ways. \n\nNow granted you can get a fresh experience even after you unlock all the mechs by making custom squads, playing random squads, trying new pilots, or doing challenge runs. But you have essentially completed the games content at this point. This isn't necessarily bad as lots of good games have much less content than this, but FTL this is not. You might be able to sink a hundred hours into this game if you really try, but you'll be hard pressed to get more than that. In the end there are only four islands, the maps are selected from a limited pool and not randomly generated, and that final mission will always be virtually the same.\n\nTLDR: Game is fantastic but there isnt enough of it.

"english", "review": "[h1]Premise[/h1]\nYou are a Time Traveling Mechcommander.  A soldier that has watched countless lives lost and many versions of Earth fall to the insidious, Insectoid Vek.  Your objective is to gather resources, allies, upgrade your mechs and blast those abominations to tiny bits!  Save the Corporate Islands and Save the Earth!  If you fail, you will travel back in time once more, with new knowledge and different mech squads to draw from.\n\n[h1]Here thar be poor design choices[/h1]\nI just want to start out by saying this, For all this game\u2019s promise it should be an early access title.  There are so many little things that add up to a dull repetitive gameplay, boring combat, frustrating limitations and an uninspiring world.  I always want to play the game in it\u2019s base form before mods, but trying to complete this game even ONCE is a slog.  Yeah, somehow these devs made time traveling, futuristic mech warriors into boring, bland, grunts. Oh it hurts so much to say that.\n\n[h1]The good.[/h1]\nFor once I\u2019m skipping this.  Mostly because all the good are outweighed by the bad in almost every way.  You don\u2019t feel like an amazing prodigy or a heroic soldier, you feel weak, under-armed, frustrated school janitor.  Especially in later levels as you wander around hoping the demonic little Vek children will stop bugging you long enough to finish cleaning up.  If anything I want to control the Vek more than the actual Mechs!  I\u2019ve lost count of the times that I\u2019m 1 space away from doing anything important, and the limits on the Mech weapons just exasperate this glaring flaw.\n \n[h1]The Story[/h1]\nWhat I said at the top?  That\u2019s the whole story.  Nothing you do will add to it and you get no background on what\u2019s going on.\n\n[h1]Lack of a glossary[/h1]\nThis is a slap in the face for completionists.  Instead of getting pictures, clips, an excerpt, a blurb, flavor text, short story, ANYTHING to flesh out this world you\u2019ll just have to bookmark the wiki.  A shame since this was an easy way to add some achievements you could actually look forward to completing.  Want one perfect example?  The artillery upgrade \u201cBuildings immune\u201d that prevents damage to buildings.  How does it work?  Advanced AI?  Smartchip tech?  Fin-stabilized missiles?  Freaking radio signals or electromagnetic shields?  Nope for all you know it\u2019s \u201cMagic\u201d.\n \n[h1]The UI[/h1]\nThere are quite a few quality of life problems. \n[list]\n[*]You can\u2019t see enemy range of movement-  This is a must for any tactical turn based game and it\u2019s lack of inclusion stinks of laziness.  You get 8+ places to place your 3 mech squad, but not a simple green overlay to show if they can be targeted?  What\u2019s the lack of information?\n[*]Lack of player confirmation for post battle choices-So on my 5th playthrough I finally get a perfect island completion bonus (literally didn\u2019t know that was a thing till that moment)!  And I get the option to choose 1 of 3 amazing rewards, I accidently click on 1 because I\u2019m confused by the blurb on the bottom and instead of a confirmation message (\u201care you sure?\u201d) it locks in my choice.  I learned later that I picked the worst one AND that the other 2 were super rare. Joy.\n[*] This game suffers from the exact same issue as FTL- It has crashed my PC enough times to convince me to never take it starting up properly for granted...\n[*]No warning what enemies will spawn-  This problem is everywhere, from your mission briefing, to your actual mission.  This feature is a must for any defense game, tower defense or strategy game.  That it isn\u2019t here just means you roll the dice on if a support unit or a terrifying Alpha will wreck your playthrough.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Scoring system[/h1]\nOh boy, this is 100% arbitrary. It\u2019s based off of defending your buildings and killing enemies that\u2019s it.  And there are no bonuses, cut scenes or unlocks for higher score, D:(\n \n[h1]The achievements[/h1]\nThe achievements are the game\u2019s unlock currency.  In a good turn based game, you should be able to get multiple achievements in 1 run and unlock.  So in theory, they should allow for multiple playstyles and different fun video clips that inspire multiple playthroughs right?  Maybe a few easier achievements that help you understand the finer points of the game?  Nope, baring 5, they are all bland, time consuming and difficult.  In fact, there are only 5 achievements at over 50% of players unlocked and exactly HALF are at under 10% of all players unlocked  Many of these are literally impossible to unlock without denying yourself resources or refusing to use powerful, RECOMMENDED tactics. Or worse, they are locked behind acquiring certain squads  Below are some examples...\n\n[list]\n[*]Perfect Battle(Current unlock level amongst players 37%)- Take no Mech or Building Damage with the Rusting Hulks Squad (Repaired Damage is still damage)-  This should NOT be restricted to 1 squad, there are many versions of this that limit your chances for fun with custom squads.\n[*]Untouchable-(Current unlock level amongst players 9%)Finish a Corporate Island without Taking Mech Damage. (Repaired damage is still damage)-So we aren\u2019t allowed to block Veks from spawning, position mechs to block incoming power grid damage OR even get our mechs pushed back.  Better pray to your RNG god of choice that the buildings can withstand multiple hits.  Worse yet, to prevent catastrophic failure, you must deny yourself Vek kills early on by focusing on pushing Vek instead of straight up damaging them.\n[*]Trusted Equipment(Current unlock level amongst players 4.2%)-Finish 3 corporate Islands without equipping any new Pilots or weapons-3 islands is over half your run..  Also, have fun with ignoring any chances for new gear.\n[*]Engineering Dropout(Current unlock level amongst players 4.1%)-Finish 3 corporate islands without powering a weapon modification.-  I have nothing more to say here, the devs have a formula their following with 0% of the logic that marks intelligent testing.\n[/list]\n\n [h1]\u201coptional objectives\u201d (Optional only if you don\u2019t want tangible rewards)[/h1]\nI\u2019ve played for 4 hours and only seen 4 types and none of them added anything other than tedium.\n[list]\n[*]Protect building/object- This is just Babysitting a rock or a mindless drone.  Hooray.  Your choices or successes here add no urgency or story elements.  What I would have done?  Use it to expand on player choice.  Sooooo, imagine you save a hospital but one of your pilots is critically wounded protecting the building from the last acidic shot of an Alpha Centipede!  A brave team of doctors saves their life at the cost of a little bit of that pilot\u2019s Exp (That amnesia/head trauma man).  I WISH this was the case, instead you just get \u201creputation\u201d  Which is a truly wasted opportunity.\n[*] Stop enemies from emerging-  So we are limiting where we an position our units?  What\u2019s worse, you often won\u2019t be able to use a weapon if you choose to do this.  Worse yet?  You don\u2019t even get exp for this, so a core part of the game is to deny your pilots exp early on...\n[*]Change the Terrain/unfreeze buildings- Way to limit your player\u2019s actions even more.  What\u2019s next?  Leave one unit at the start to \u201cEscort civilians\u201d (Don\u2019t even think about it devs!)\n[*] Retrieve time pods!-  gaining extra pilots, weapons, reactors and loot!  The issue here?  The programming team messed up and made Vek able to move TURN Zero and kill them.  They claim this has been patched, but you have to wonder why this was there in the first place...\n [/list]\n\n[h1]The fail state[/h1]\nThis has caused the most controversy of all the game\u2019s mechanics.  You lose instantly when your power grid drops to zero.  You take damage to your grid whenever a Vek make a successful attack against any Grid Building.  Unfortunately they start with an have a 80% success rate and upgrading your \u201cGrid Resistance\u201d is expensive, time consuming, and unrewarding.\n\nSee my Comments below for the rest of the review.", "timestamp_created": 1520699610, "timestamp_updated": 1520699836, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.396505", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40715942": {"recommendationid": "40715942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001314857", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 991, "last_played": 1521593433}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game.

Has a run-based structure like FTL and that's about it for similarities. \n\nWell, reading the other reviews, I've realized that I'm an intellectual dwarf compared to the tactical megaminds that apparently populate Steam, because it took me 13 or so hours before I could beat a run on Easy and about 5 more before I got the chicken dinner on Normal. So if you're coming off playing FTL on Hard with one hand and They Are Billions on 400% with the other, this may not be the game for you. \n\nOne thing I do agree with the megaminds on is that this definitely is not a conventional strategy game. Every enemy attack is perfectly telegraphed, and *every* attack either hits or it doesn't. That's why people are describing this as feeling like a puzzle game: often, there is a clearly optimal solution to the board as laid out and you just need to find it. For some people, that's a dealbreaker, and I get it. I like XCOM, I like D&D: the chance of coming through clutch when you're probably fucked balanced by the chance of getting screwed on something you should have in the bag can add spice to the game. But I also like chess puzzles and Invisible Inc., and Into The Breach scratches the same itch that those things do. \n\nI would say the best moments in this game fall into two categories. One, you think you're fucked and have to take a huge hit to the face. And then suddenly you see it: a beautiful combination of tractor beams and acid-bath drownings and shielding the citizenry with your giant robot bodies, and the only way to leave your pretty good run intact. Two, you suddenly notice a new thing one of your mechs can do. Not that the game ever hides anything on you, but it doesn't hold your hand about stuff like how your giant rock launcher mech's rocks don't break unless they hit an enemy, which means they're perfectly good conductors of a lightning whip strike from another mech in the same squad. \n\nThat said, it's certainly not perfect. The story is functional, and lines up with the gameplay in some neat ways, but it's nothing super special or deep. Procedural generation means that maps eventually start to blur together a bit, although it takes longer than it should because of decent variety in environments and missions within those environments.

I can gladly say I don't regret it at all.\n\nThe gameplay is very rewarding and the combat is in-depth. Every turn you have to figure out how you can save the targeted buildings while simultaneously keeping your squad alive and fighting back the Vek. You could have the game of your life and lose everything in 1 poor turn. You could have the worst game ever and somehow barely make it out alive, just to come back and win against the Vek. The game always keeps you on your toes, demanding your attention. The stakes are high.\n\nInto The Breach has very good progression. There are 8 squads, all of which have 3 mechs with unique abilities. Each squad has three achievements tied to them and additionally there are global achievements. When you complete these achievements, you get medals that you can use to unlock new squads. Each squad plays differently and it really adds to the longevity of the game.\n\nDuring battles there's a chance that a time pod falls nearby. Sometimes they have a new pilot inside, and these pilots offer bonuses for your mechs. When you first encounter a new pilot, you unlock them in your hangar and you can pick one pilot from all your unlocked pilots at the start of each new playthrough.\n\nI have to say, the soundtrack is amazing and Subset Games are right up there with Supergiant Games for me. Excellent Indie devs, that is.\n\nIf you're into strategy games, I can't possibly imagine why you wouldn't enjoy this game.

Each battle plays out on a tiled eight-by-eight grid that you and your adversaries take turns attacking and defending. With every successful mission, your crew advances toward the Vek hive and collects upgrades and experience along the way. Failure sends a pilot of your choice back to an alternative timeline to start anew, while keeping your current mech\u2019s upgraded attributes. Every move is entirely deliberate, with no random number generator to muddle your approach.\n\nWhile you\u2019re sure to face adversity, the game never feels unfair.

"last_played": 1520950063}, "language": "english", "review": "Into The Breach (ITB) is a quickfire blast of intense strategy, and if that\u2019s your bag then it will please you enormously.\n\nOthers have compared it to Advance Wars and XCom, but it isn\u2019t much like either of those. ITB punishes relaxed play more than either of those games, but it also holds up its end of the bargain by giving significant rewards for success.\n\nEach battle takes place on an 8x8 grid, with your three mechs often outnumbered by baddies, more of which emerge from the ground as you play. It\u2019s turn based, so you can take as long as you like to consider your options, and you can roll back movement if you are not happy. But once a mech has fired its weapon or taken an action (such as repairing itself) that mech cannot move (unless you have a perk that allows a subsequent move). You can also reset your whole turn once per battle.\n\nBattles are played out over 5 turns, and your objectives per battle will depend on which of several regions you decide to do battle in. There is a persistent power grid meter that will fall as the buildings in each region get destroyed, so as well as surviving the battle and meeting any objectives you also have to protect buildings to maintain the power meter.\n\nThere are several classes of mech you can use, which are unlocked using tokens you gain during campaigns. The more you play the more styles of mech you can unlock. You can assemble any kind of team of three mechs you like, either by chaos rolls, ordered rolls or by editing the team manually. You can put together any combination through the team editor, even having three identical mechs, and there are various achievements to be gained as you explore the combinations.\n\nThen there are pilots, whose experience is carried from playthrough to playthrough. They can be killed too, which gives the game a real edge. In one recent game I was in the final level and lost my star pilot to an environmental hazard I just hadn\u2019t seen. The character is still available to play with, but they will lose all their valuable experience.\n\nRegions are bundled into islands, and you will have to clear a minimum of two subsidiary islands before you can progress to the final island. So, if you are in good shape after two islands it makes sense to go to the final one, but if you have struggled and need to stat up you can keep playing and see if you can recover some ground. On easiest difficulty this is pretty straightforward, but the higher settings are quite taxing (at least they were for my old brain!)\n\nThe rewards for clearing an island include tokens which allow you to refill the power meter, and others you can use to upgrade your mechs.\n\nThe deceptively straightforward interface and level design might make you think the game is simple or easy, but it\u2019s really more like chess or a complex card game, with all the parts finely balanced the way a good board game would be.\n\nOne of the most innovative elements, and the one that makes the whole game nicely different, is the way you can see every enemy action before it happens. Enemies get to emerge from the ground, make a move AND set up an attack all in one turn, but the consequences of the enemy attacks do not happen until the player ends their turn, so using all the various weapons at your disposal you can thwart the enemy plans by destroy their units directly or even move them around so that their attacks hit empty space or other enemy units. Very cool!\n\nAll in all this is a terrific half hour time waster that deserves a place in the collection of every turn based strategy fan.\n", "timestamp_created": 1520623919, "timestamp_updated": 1520623919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40690580": {"recommendationid": "40690580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098539576", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 139, "last_played": 1521060204}, "language": "polish", "review": "The best brain trainer ever :)", "timestamp_created": 1520622308, "timestamp_updated": 1520622308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40689942": {"recommendationid": "40689942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052343301", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520478264}, "language": "english", "review": "GOOD GAME.

I have squads to unlock and victories to claim for each. Each of the different squads, which you unlock by earning achivments, changes the mechanics entirely. And the insects have picked up too! sometimes there is no way you will avoid damage,  and if it were better explained what logics the insects were following it would be a perhaps more interesting puzzle game. but we already get to see what they are going to attack on the turn and that is already a great deal of information for the player. The interface, by the way, is amazing and was well executed. \n\nBonus points for having a colorblind mode! I really welcome that. \n\nI only wish it were also available on Linux, but then I wouldn't be able to get any work done!\n\ntldr : great strategy & puzzle game with lots of content, no regrets, 11/10 would recommend again", "timestamp_created": 1520598880, "timestamp_updated": 1520598880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40680862": {"recommendationid": "40680862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064243996", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 381, "last_played": 1521350934}, "language": "english", "review": "Like FTL and advanced wars had a baby.

"english", "review": "The game feels like and looks like a really well made Game Boy Advance (If anyone remembers that system) game that ripped off Advance War and made the formula for the game type better by implementing various knockback, mobility, environmental, and status mechanics into the game; all of which blend and interact with one another nicely. Knock back and enemy/ally unit placement/manipulation are easily the strongest core mechanics within the game.\n\nThe core gameplay itself (Positioning and attacking with your units, and moving enemy units with knockback and/or applying a status) while simple is strong, satisfying, and at times can create complex puzzle like situations in regards of what to do with your units so that no cities are damaged.\n\nThe RNG in the game seems to be a bit off as i've had levels be generated to be impossible not to take major damage and levels that spawn in with very easy enemy placement. There's no real narrative story but a general concept for a conflict and the enemy unit types don't vary a great deal and only symbolize significant strength increases with color. The player Mech variety is nice though you have to spend time unlocking achievements to gain coins to unlock all of the Mechs. The game's difficulty can be really easy to very difficult depending on the mechs you pick along with the RNG.\n\nSo far I haven't found a single mech or predesignated squad of mechs that is useless, however certain mechs/squads are more effective at certain situations than others and that fact that you lack of ability to constantly swap out mechs before each mission means that you are at the mercy of the RNG in regards to how well your squad will perform. \n\nThe game's story mode is not overly long as you can beat it in about an hour however that's if you are running through it and the game won't be perfect and you own't have all the mechs unlocked, this game also emphasizes restarting the game several times through a time traveler mechanic that lets you send a single pilot back into time to help a new campagin and new pilots start another campaign. The Lack of story length is certainly a downside but the replayability is moderate due to RNG and variety of mechs to use.\n\nOverall the game has a very strong core mechanic, an appealing visual style (atleast to me, even the recolors of units are fine to me.), is rough around the edges in regards to RNG, lacks feature length campaign, has moderate to high replayability depending on how much you like the core gameplay, and could use more enemy variety. (I also wouldn't mind more mechs being added however there is a fair amount all ready.)\n\nIt is important to note that I got this game with a free copy of FTL.

What i liked about FTL was that there were many ships to unlock. There were hidden quests and ships. A bunch of weapons and and different planets. FTL was great. Beating the game actually felt rewarding because it took skill, and hours of hard work.\n\nBut this game is not what i was wanting from subset games.\nIts boring\nRepettitive\nAnd seems to require more luck than skill.\n\nThis game has almost no variation in anything apart from the maps being randomized. It has about 4 main, and only enemies in the game. Now there are \"different enemies\" but the only difference in them is their color and how much hp they have. Because of that, it feels like im fighting the same enemies over and over again, and maps that have almost no variation in them.\n\nIve found myself in an impossible situation where it doesnt matter what i would do, it was impossible to save cities. I'd spend around 5 minutes analysing the best possible move i can make, only to find out that in the end, I cant stop an attack from happening, or the moves that i made before, make the moves of the next vex impossible to stop. \n\nThe battery defense is stupid.\nIve had moments in the game where i had 30 or 40 percent battery resistence to defend against the vex, and it feels like it does nothing. I had a moment in the game where 4 vex attacked at cities on 1 map in 1 turn. and not 1 of the cities resisted the attacks. And it felt like that everytime my city was hit, I would never get any resistence. It felt no different with 25 percent or 40 percent.\n\nThe pilots skills.\nThey suck. Theres litterally only like 3 or 4 abilities that the pilots can unlock, and 1 of them is +3 resistence. Most useless skill ever. \n\nArent many weapons\nWhenever i had the chance to choose new weapons after completing an island, I would almost never get anything new. That might just be bad luck, or because i havent played any other mechs though.\n\nThere no point in completing other islands.\nYou can go fight the boss after the 2nd island, and its supposed to cater to how much you've done in the game. The game even tells you, that the only point of going to the other islands, is for more points. Not because it actaully benefits you.\n\n\nWell thats about all i can think of on top of my head. And compared to FTL, this game is barebone, and boring. So please if you are debating on buying this game, do not buy it.

The basic premise is giant robats fighting giant bugs; just your standard Sci-Fi action stuff. Then you add a dash of time travel and you've got Into the Breach.\n\nNow if you are coming to this game from FTL, don't expect a similar game. Into the Breach has more in common with chess than it does with FTL. Each turn takes place in two basic phases. The giant bugs (each with unique attack styles and abilities) move into position to attack your cities. These cities are your game's health bar. You then move your 3 mechs in an attempt to stop these attacks from damaging your cities. Every attack does exactly what it says it will, 100% of the time. There is not XCOM style 99% misses. You click punch that bug back a tile, it goes back a tile. And this is really where the genius of the game is. The bugs will follow through on their planned moves regardless of what happens. So if you knock one of their own in the way, you get a helping hand from the enemy.\n\nAll in all each mission plays like a mini puzzle that reacts to your actions. You then have to manage the upgrading of the mechs and which of your three pilots you want in the next timeline. All in all Into the Breach is a wonderfully challenge.

The game is a puzzle game more than anything else, where the moves you make against an AI opponent have nothing to do with RNG and are always static, but this is also true of the CPU opponent. What is determined by RNG is how your units level up and what gear you will receive. This means that while RNG won't influence the outcome of the actual battles (making it more of a puzzle game), your turn OPTIONS in battle will be determined by RNG, while the enemy constantly grows in power in a static way. This means you can't compensate as easily for bad gear RNG during a battle because your enemies won't miss, and you won't get any lucky hits. You can't \"gamble\" the way you might in a roguelike turn, risking the odds for a higher reward. Personally I find the predictable, puzzle-like aspect of the game to be dull, and the RNG aspect of gearing up / leveling up to be great, but inappropriate for the puzzle style of play.\n\nThis is the kind of game I'd initially want to recommend to my friends who like puzzle games, but then they'd be turned off by the RNG aspect of what options they're given.

Let me tell you why you should pick this up.\n\nThe gameplay is such - You control three mechs in a squad that have different abilities built around a central theme. For instance, the Flaming Behemoths are all about spreading fire and the basic Rift Walkers are simple hit and move abilities. Your objectives change each map but in addition to those, you must protect your buildings from destruction or else instant game over (Which isn't a problem as a full game takes around 30-60 minutes.) Who's destroying your buildings and the world? A wide variety of kaiju insects!\n Now these insects are pretty interesting, they get tuckered out after scurrying around, so they MOVE FIRST then telegraph their ATTACKS SECOND.  Between the move and their attack, you move your mechs and attack with them to either EXTERMINATE the insects or MOVE THEM AWAY from doing damage to buildings or your units. Let me say, understanding the order of operations in this game will lead you to success in this timestream. \nEach map only takes 5 TURNS and at the end of those turns you win the map. Easy survival peasy. It's completing the objectives and defending your buildings that will be the difficult part. You can win a map without ever directly killing an enemy by just moving them all around out of the way, but you may be overwhelmed without taking at least a few of them out. \nYou can UPGRADE your MECHS and PILOTS thoughout the game by installing reactor cores and choosing which upgrades you want to invest in.

While it poses as and has all of the makings of a game that falls more in line with other turn-based strategies like X-COM or Advanced Wars, it stands apart by using simplicity to trick you in to thinking you won\u2019t keep losing until you hate everyone and everything.\n\n[h1]64 Squares of Strategy[/h1]\nAt first glance, Into the Breach doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to throw much at you.  It\u2019s visually very similar to Advanced Wars and I think if you watched a trailer cutting together a bunch of quick scenes you would assume that\u2019s what it was.  However, instead of large armies and damage based on dice rolls, you start each play session picking a specific squad that you\u2019ll be using until you either win, or much more likely, fail miserably at saving humanity.  Each of your three-mech unit has a pilot that can level up and gain stat boosts or special skills and each mech has a starting weapon or ability (sometimes two).  These mech abilities end up defining your each mech and make them feel very similar to chess pieces that perform a singular task.  The difference there is that, if you\u2019re successful, you can outfit your mech with additional weapons and abilities that can change or expand its role in the game.  \n\nYou\u2019ll be using these mechs to face off against a bug-like alien threat that burrows up through the ground threatening humanity.  Each side will trade off like other turn based strategies, but what makes it unique is that, after the initial placement of your units on the map (in a defined area away from the in-place bugs), the aliens move first.  They don\u2019t attack in this move, but rather position themselves and broadcast the attack that is about to happen.  This creates a mechanic where your job is to react to the actions of the enemy to stop them from doing damage.  Their goal is to attack buildings, and every building they destroy lowers the potential number of rescued civilians at the end of the game.  However, more important than score, every destroyed building lowers your power level by one.  The power level is treated essentially as hitpoints for the campaign.  If you run out of power, it\u2019s game over.  \n\nThe moderate variety of enemies with their different attacks, strengths, and weaknesses creates a dynamic level of gameplay when placed up against your selected squad of three mechs and their assigned abilities.  For something that is so minimalistic, even after hours of gameplay I felt like I was encountering new scenarios that challenged me at every turn \u2013 and that\u2019s even before I\u2019ve unlocked more than half of the mech squads.  If there is one thing that is frustrating about this game, it\u2019s the fact that unlocking mechs can force you to do employ strategies that aren\u2019t really optimal and one suboptimal attack can easily cascade into a waterfall of failure.  Yet, to some degree, that\u2019s one of the interesting challenges to the game itself \u2013 and another reason to go ahead and knock out some rounds on easy difficulty.\n\n[h1]Save the world\u2026 or try to save it again[/h1]\n\nThe overarching goal of Into the Breach is to save the world from the bug-aliens by clearing at least two of the four main islands, each lead by a unique caricature of a leader and boasting their own distinct biomes and hazards.  Once you\u2019ve achieved that, a fifth island is unlocked and serves as the final battle.  It\u2019s more  challenging, but the difficulty dynamically changes with however many islands you\u2019ve done.  So it\u2019s possible to win with 2, 3, or 4 islands completed and there are achievements for each.  Yet it seems like it might be tougher to finish three or four islands successfully than to just beat the game itself.\n\nIf you lose all of your power hitpoints and fail, you\u2019re not left just to restart from scratch, you get to exploit the game\u2019s bit of \u201ctime travel\u201d where you send one of your (preferably experienced) pilots back in time to start the next campaign.  The same happens even if you win in order to give you the same advantage whatever the case is for your next run.  The time travel concept also is present in the single \u201creset turn\u201d action you get in each battle.  While you\u2019re always able to undo movement, this allows you to also undo actions like attacks in case there\u2019s a consequence you didn\u2019t anticipate after acting.  It sounds silly, but I find that I use it in the majority of the battles.  It creates a gameplay loop that takes the edge off the frustration of losing a run whether you\u2019ve been on it for a few minutes or a few hours.  That, along with unlocking new groups of mechs, had me restarting immediately even after losing in the final fight.  It\u2019s really impressive that the developers managed to do this both in FTL and in their new title.\n\n[h1]Not FTL, but just as addictive[/h1]\n\nDespite being fundamentally and mechanically as different as possible, Into the Breach captures much of the same pure fun that made FTL a classic.  It provides a type of gameplay that starts out simple and approachable with very straightforward rules, but it grows in complexity and difficulty at a rate that keeps it engaging and makes it fun many hours in.  It takes all of the right aspects from familiar games and mixes them in the formula (if it can even be called that) that made FTL such a lasting icon, but does it in a way that feels new even to someone like me who\u2019s played way too many games.  I hope that Subset Games can keep putting this much obvious care and refinement into future games because it\u2019s the core of what makes Indie games so wonderful to play.  \n\nAbbreviated Review: https://youtu.be/ew0odUUzwuQ\n\nIf you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28346672-Endyo-Gaming/", "timestamp_created": 1520530711, "timestamp_updated": 1520530733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40659829": {"recommendationid": "40659829", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138034962", "num_games_owned": 419, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520435996}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc2a4\ud300 \ud0d1\uace8 \uacf5\uc6d0 \uc0ac\uc774\ubc84 \uc7a5\uae30\uac00 \uc720\ud589\uc774\ub2e4\n\n\uadf8 \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \ubc14\ub85c Into the Breach\n\uba54\uce74\ub85c \uc7a5\uae30\ub450\ub294 \uadf8 \ub9db!!\n\n\uc774 \ud68c\uc0ac\uc758 \uc804\uc791\uc778 FTL\uc5d0\uc120 \ud53c\uc9c0\uceec\uc801 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4\uba74\n\uc774\ubc88\uc791\ud488\uc740 \uadf8\ub7f0 \uac83 \uc5c6\uc774 \uc21c\uc218 \uc9f1\uad6c\ub9cc \uc798 \uad74\ub9ac\uba74 \ub41c\ub2e4!!", "timestamp_created": 1520530415, "timestamp_updated": 1520530415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590571", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40659692": {"recommendationid": "40659692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027935365", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 188, "last_played": 1520685641}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ubcf8\uaca9 \uc11c\uc21c \uac8c\uc784", "timestamp_created": 1520530099, "timestamp_updated": 1520530099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40659598": {"recommendationid": "40659598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040830875", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1049, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 154, "last_played": 1520903029}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly rewarding puzzle-based tactical game!

Gonna try splitting this up if you're just looking for specifics.\n\nWhat I love about \"Into the Breach\" is hard to place. As far as strategy games go this one is really simple. It lacks the length and depth you'd find in other prolonged games. My fondness for stories and systems to master does not mean I can't enjoy this. This game is actually really great for the casual player. A person maybe short on time looking to get in and out. An hour or two of playing and you've just saved the world. Not a bad thing depending on perspective. At the worst there is a lot of wasted potential but best not to think on what ifs or could haves.\n\n[b] The good\t[/b]\nComparing \"Into the Breach\" to \"FTL: Faster than Light\", the other game from the same devs, I'd say \"Into the Breach\" has a better foundation of gameplay. It isn't one big random number generator. The player has a battlefield to control and the game doesn't keep secrets. Mouse over an enemy or a tile and you can learn just what they are about and there is no ambiguity in the text. If a boulder is gonna fall some place on the board it won't say \"A boulder will land here\". It will say \"A boulder will land here killing any unit here\". The game is, for the most part, in the players hands. It is a true strategy experience in the sense that you look at the data and make a choice. And with the various different mechs to unlock and weapons/tools you can obtain there will be a lot of choices to consider.\n\nYou also have more freedom to perform well and be rewarded. In \"FTL\" you can win fight after fight after fight and amass a hoard of scrap. No guarantee you'll get value out of it though as shops are the rarity and without repairing or buying better weapons your run could just be doomed to fail. Not so in this one. Play well and defeat the Vek and you'll find a use for the game currency.\n\n[b] The bad\t[/b]\nSadly I think this is where the praise ends. Looking back on \"FTL\" it did feel at times like winning or losing wasn't up to me. The little thing called luck that determined a good portion of my success stories in it. But it had something more that \"Into the Breach\" doesn't have. It had a level of charm with its music and the random events that kept things interesting. The graphics weren't great on paper but very fitting to the game all things taken together.\n\nI feel \"Into the Breach\" lacks that. None of the music stands out to me. The characters are some interesting in mannerisms but you're not gonna see much past that. Perhaps that's all fitting and intentional though. This game is about a gritty war after all. However the end result does mean I'm not left with any lasting feelings or as enamored with the game.\n\nAlso huge spoilers about the ending I wasn't too fond of. [spoiler] The ending feels like nothing. You're playing and fighting and if you lose you go back in time to try again in the hopes of saving a timeline from the Vek. When you win you go back in time again to save.... another timeline from the Vek? I don't even get any cool character endings or anything? I don't know, just felt this was lame and a bit underwhelming.\t[/spoiler]\n\n[b] The unforgivable\t[/b]\nThe absolute objectively bad thing I can see is the tutorial. For an opt in tutorial it leaves out a few very key details. Information is always available to the player by mousing over stuff and usually doing so will show a tool tip the first time but the tutorial never gives mention to things like the \"reset turn\" button (which barring a game update isn't even present in the tutorial) or the \"attack order\" icon. It doesn't point out the \"undo move\" button either as a potential option to the player. I know it is there in plain sight next to \"end turn\" but maybe it would have been kind to tell the player, that felt like they needed the tutorial, that this is an option for when you end up in the wrong place. This last section may just be a gripe with the devs but it's relevant to bring up as one of the games shortcomings.", "timestamp_created": 1520524957, "timestamp_updated": 1520524957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40657776": {"recommendationid": "40657776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041165480", "num_games_owned": 4504, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 128, "last_played": 1520473465}, "language": "english", "review": "Into the Breach is the sophomore game of Subset Games, the creators of FTL (Faster Than Light), and it's safe to say that they delivered another hit.\n\nThe game is a turn-based strategy game, that plays a little bit like chess. The goal of the game is to save the world against an alien threat, in order to do so you have a team of 3 mechs with unique abilities, upgrades, attacks, and more. You get sent down to a square tile (much like a chess board) where you will have to survive and save civilians, as well as completing bonus objectives to gain extra resources. To make the game more challenging you have a power grid, each time an alien destroys a building you will lose 1-2 bars (depending on the structure), once you run out of bars you lose the game, so the game is not all about saving yourself, and you will be in situations where you will have to choose between sacrificing 1 of your mechs in order to save a building. \n\nThe game can be beat in just a few hours, but don't let that scare you away, the game is built to be replayed over and over again, and with randomly generated challenges for each battle, every play-through will be different. \n\nOverall Into the Breach is a very simple but solid game, with ranging difficulty so even if you're new to turn-based games you won't have any problems jumping in and learning the ropes quickly. At first it may seem a bit confusing, but it won't take long until you get the hang on things, and once you do there is hours of fun to be had with this title. \n\nI strongly recommend this game to fans of strategy & turn-based games, and if you've ever wanted to get into those kinds of games, Into the Breach will be a great starting point.\n", "timestamp_created": 1520524788, "timestamp_updated": 1520524788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602892", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40656714": {"recommendationid": "40656714", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036279680", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1882, "last_played": 1521711780}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e94\u810f\u4ff1\u5168", "timestamp_created": 1520522127, "timestamp_updated": 1520522127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40656431": {"recommendationid": "40656431", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968542368", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 213, "last_played": 1521150268}, "language": "english", "review": "Very addictive!

The game also lets you combine mechs from different teams, only you won't be able to get the same acheivements as you would with either of the teams. It's like if you combined aspects of several different ships in ftl, but sacrificed your ability to unlock new ones. I haven't tried it yet but I'm extremely excited because a few hours in I can already make a killer team! They also explain the reason you play through the game infinitely and it's the most interesting explanation of that I've ever seen in a roguelike! Great lore!

Everything about this is meticulously crafted.  Read some of the devs' articles on the UI designs and considerations cause it'll give you more appreciation for what they've presented to you as a player.  They've singlehandedly solved a lot of issues I see in strategy games where the unit attack behaviours ( both sides ) are just a bit unclear.  Everything is visually represented on the map and the hover tooltips explain the attack behaviours by way of simple looping animations.  What that means for this game is that it lowers the barrier of entry for newcomers to turn-based strategy games.  If you enjoyed Advance Wars, I think you'll enjoy this more.\n\nThank you Subset Games for delivering YET another beautifully crafted game!

But I'll just say that into the breach is a really engaging tactics based strategy game that has presentation as good as its gameplay.\n\nI've heard a lot of people say that game is \"too easy\", but I think that's because they're playing on the... easy difficulty. Back in the FTL days the game was so hard and random and punishing that a lot of people felt you could only play the game easy if you wanted a chance at actually beating the game (which was still extremely slim). But into the breach has much less punishing and random gameplay, making the normal and hard difficulties appropriate challenges. That being said, the easy difficulty really is easy, and I reccomend starting the game on easy just to get a feel for how it plays, and so you can unlock a good amount of mech squads quickly. But I implore you, once you feel comfortable in the game and you found a mech squad you really like, go onto the higher difficulties, that's where you really feel what the combat system has to offer.\n\nAs an artist who really finds art direction important in games for me to get interested in, I'm surprised I've talked so much about gameplay, haha. The art for Into the Breach is also very very good, the portraits are gorgeous, the in-game sprites are readable and the mechs look badass. This is clearly a game with a lot of thought put into every aspect of it, not just the gameplay and fantastic UI.\n\nI definitely reccomend Into the Breach.

Those who don't, stay away. Play this game for the fun of fiddling with tactical tools, not the feeling of progression and levelling-up. \n\nThe review by Rock, paper shotgun is spot on in describing the game's features.  (see https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/02/27/into-the-breach-ftl-sequel-review/). It's a no frills (almost) perfect information tactical game with a laser sharp focus on providing tactical tools to manipulate the battle in your favour. Every turn feels like a puzzle where you manipulate the board in response to enemy action. \n\nWhat I will elaborate on instead is what the game lacks. It lacks a complete Skinner Box, a.k.a. progression system. There is little in the form of positive reinforcement systems within the game to trick your brain. Progression is pretty light, this isn't a game you play to feel like you're building up a epic squad take on epic enemies. The only thing which is getting \"epic\" is you, the player, in your actual skills.\n\nInstead, you play this game for fiddling with the mechanics. Think of it as playing with a very well made toy. You can do all sorts of cool and interesting funny maneveurs with the tools you've been given which make YOU feel like a badass. Even the achievements (through which you unlock new stuff) are not given for WINNING the game. The achievements are tied to playing with the game's systems, such as make 4 enemies die from friendly fire with the Judo squad. Block 4 damage with shields in the laser/shields squad. Win a battle killing fewer than 3 enemies with the ice squad. That sort of thing.\n\nBut does your toy \"level up\" as keep playing with it? Not this one. By the end of the game your squad is stronger, sure. But it's pretty light. Being a \"play this game for the fun of fiddling with tactical tools\" means it doesn't have as much longevity as some other game with a Skinner Box. But that's fine.

From FTL being life and death with a roll of a dice, it feel really good to get something new.\n\nThe Mechs and Vek (The enemy you have to fight) look really good, especially for pixel art.\n\nEach Pilot is memorable from the cool headed Starter Pilot War Vet to the Gardener AI Pilot. \n\nThe Battles are Fair: You know what you are getting (because you can see the map before the fight and where the ememy are, there are no secret objectives [aside from Time Pods], and the enemy broadcast what they will do before you move so you can theoretically counter everything they do), and you know most of everything when you enter the fight. Nothing is hidden from you, so what you make is what you get. This game is the biggest \"You Reap What You Sow\" example I have seen in a while.\n\nThe Soundtrack is amazing, but I never had any doubts about Ben Prunty's skills.\n\nDeath Sucks, but it is a harsh lesson, and it can make you feel more determined to win next time.\n\nThe \"Aha!\" moment when you get a perfect battle is amazing to feel, and you feel rewarded for success because it wasn't handed to you: you earned this victory, through grit, tears, and selling your soul to RNGesus and the three other high Gods of Gaming.\n\nAnimation is crisp, and aside from small lag moments when moving the mouse (I blame my computer mostly) it runs like a gem. No waiting periods, loading screens, just fluid combat.\n\nREASONS TO NOT BUY:\n\nYou don't have $15 (In which case you have my sympathy)\n\nYou are not a fan of Rogue-Like games, and tend to rage easily. Because losing in this game hurts, and if you have trouble losing games, you will hate this game.\n\nYou hate games that (as of 3/7/2018) have a critic score of 91 on Metacritic and a user score of 8.1 (from 90 submissions).\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\n9.8/10: The only issue I have is that after many straight days of playing, it gets a bit repetitive when you find a set up a strategy that you like.

The visuals and music are all gorgeous and there are a lot of tough choices on what to invest time and effort into, both in selecting which skirmish to beign next and in the skirmishes themselves where you might have to decide between completing one objective and failing another, rescuing a building or a cryo-pod, there's a lot of figuring out what an acceptible loss for the turn you're on would be.\n\nOverall, you should definitely buy this game.

Into the Breach cuts out all the elements I disliked and has a lot of unique features that make it the best turn based strategy I have played by far. \n\nYour enemies attacks are all telegraphed on your turn. This, coupled with the many attacks in the game that move or turn enemies gives you the opportunity to counter your opponents every turn. This is much easier said than done however as there will often be more threats than you have answers.\n\nThe diversity of playstyles throughout the 8 different squads offers a ton of diversity and replay value (you can even make custom squads with any 3 mechs)\n\nFinally the game offers easy medium and hard modes, don't expect to be beating normal until you really learn to think outside the box.

There are simply too many enemies, too many variables. You stare at the screen for 10 minutes, 20, 30-- if only I could get a unit right THERE to knock that one to the side-- if only I still had that weapon I unlocked last run that pushed everything in a straight line-- if only that unit had a melee attack-- and then it hits you. The perfect solution. You need to make use of all your units, using their abilities perfectly, taking advantage of the tertiary effects of their attacks and the special abilities of your pilots, but you can do it. You can not only survive this no-win situation, you can WIN, and you can do it in style.\n\nWhat makes Into the Breach great is when you execute a seemingly perfect plan-- knocking enemies to the side so they target each other, forcing them to cover their own allies' spawn points, sending them flying into a lake-- and then realize, when it's too late to matter, that your brilliant plan just sent the corpse of a giant bug-monster flying into a city, demolishing it and killing dozens of people.\n\nThe best part of Into the Breach is when you've finally mastered a new squad of mechs; you've learned how their abilities work in tandem, the best way to utilize them, the best pilot for the job, which upgrades to prioritize and why. They move like a well-oiled machine, running circles around the Vek and making it look easy.\n\nWhat makes Into the Breach great is how every time you unlock a new mech squad, for your first couple missions (often your first couple runs) they feel useless; their abilities aren't just worse than the squad they were using before, they're actively detrimental. You're accidentally cancelling your own attacks, or blowing up buildings with the shockwave from your artillery blasts, or setting your own units on fire. Your reaction every time you're working with a new squad is \"wow, these guys suck, huh?\"\n\nThe best part of Into the Breach is when you finally win. After trying over and over, giving up on timeline after timeline, you finally, finally, FINALLY win. You defeat the Vek, and you save humanity, and you know that it was through your practice, your intelligence, your understanding of your mechs and the enemy Vek, that you were able to do it. And it feels GREAT.\n\nWhat makes Into the Breach great is knowing how much sacrifice it took to get there. Even in those timelines you saved, you couldn't help everybody. There were regions on each island you were forced to abandon, hundreds of lives you decided were acceptable losses. There were times when the situation really was unwinnable, and you prioritized the lives of your own pilots, or you prioritized completing an objective, over the lives of the people you were supposed to protect, and you did it for the greater good.

The actual gameplay feels more akin to solving a puzzle than anything, and as you complete more islands the puzzles become more complex. There's a good foundation to build a truely great game here, but right now it feels kind of barbones, like a title that just released on early access. This isn't bad though as the moment to moment gameplay puzzle solving is fun, and the game is cheap.\n\nMany of its current systems though don't really provide the experience it seems to be going for outside of the moment to moment gameplay. You never feel like your mechs make significant progress because how you approach the combat puzzles doesn't really change as the game goes on, you just get slight modifiers which might slightly change up your strategy, but it's not enough to be truely engaging imo. When I complete an island I pretty much always take the power cores instead of anything else because you need power cores to get stronger, and upgrade the weapons you do have. Wheather you choose to do 2 islands or 4 feels of little consequence because the scope of both feel quite similar, due to how boring the upgrades are and how you'll only really grab 1 or 2 weapons on your whole run because weapons are useless without the power to power them and make them stronger.\n\nYou have to achievement hunt for coins which are used to unlock other mech squads. As someone who isn't an avid achievement hunter I thought this system was servicable, as the reward is pretty cool, but I could see why people that hate achievement hunting wouldn't enjoy this.\n\nRight now there is quite a bit of content here to enjoy between the different mech squads and learning how to use them, trying out your own custom mech squads, or maybe even doing a challenge run with the first random squad you get. I could see someone getting about 30 hours of gameplay, but it's hard to imagine anyone playing this game for upwards of 100+ hours as many have done with ftl.\n\nI see a lot of potential for into the breach and as it is now I do reccomend it because of it's price point. However I would love to see what this game could turn into if it's given the proper development time. What about bigger maps, more mechs on a map at a given time, mechs that feel like they evolve over the course of a game and are different than when they started, which could be solved by as easily as giving the player more power cores and adjusting the difficulty slightly, longer runs that feel more akin to a campaign rather than an arcade run. It's kind of like xcom, if xcom was locked to 4 characters per mission, which to anyone whose played xcom, knows that it's a far more fun game when you play with 6 per mission.", "timestamp_created": 1520438098, "timestamp_updated": 1520438098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40633164": {"recommendationid": "40633164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192771881", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1724, "last_played": 1521221958}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "great game, expect more maps and mechs.", "timestamp_created": 1520437516, "timestamp_updated": 1520437516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40633112": {"recommendationid": "40633112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025936724", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1287, "last_played": 1521506599}, "language": "english", "review": "There are no little mistakes.

Each island is a series of missions ending in a boss fight. After beating 2-4 islands you can challenge the final level. It's not hard to clear on normal difficulty, but bad RNG or poor planning can end what looks like a great run.\n\nFor the price it's well worth it.

As it doesn't have the same kind of random events you can happen onto that keep the game fresh for dozens of hours. Instead, it relies on semi-procedurally-generated missions. These are great.\n\nThe game is $15 USD. I don't need to get the at least 200 hours I've gotten out of FTL through the years to get my money's worth or love it. And holy crap do I love it.\n\nSo the game starts with a five-second cutscene that tells you everything you need to know about the story and that makes the metaprogression of multiple runs and unlocking things part of the plot which is really cool, and then you jump right in.\n\nAnd what you jump into is very easy to understand, very clear in its mechanics, and very well-designed and very fun.\n\nI adore the music of FTL, and Ben Prunty has perhaps done an even better job with this soundtrack. I don't see myself listening to it on its own as much as FTL's, but I certainly will still do so. But for the game, it's phenomenal. It makes a lo-fi isometric game that actually fails to establish scale properly in a number of ways (I'll get to that) feel perfect anyway. It makes you feel like a mech pilot fighting for humanity's survival. It's melancholy and rich and anachronist in a way that fits the game's setting so well. You have futuristic synths merging with violins beautifully. It makes me want more of this setting so much. Hell, it's made me play another run immediately multiple times.\n\nThen there's the mechanics. Into the Breach boils down tile-based tactics to a minimalist state that retains all the fun, but cuts out much of the frustration. It is all deterministic; non-random; in the battles themselves. You have perfect information every turn. No playing the odds of hitting and getting screwed. Just your wits. But the battles are small enough in scale that nothing ever gets too intimidating or stressful.\n\nThere is, however, one exception to the non-randomness of battles, and it's my one real gripe with the game: building damage. Essentially, you have a life bar that continues on through the whole game in the form of the \"power grid.\" If buildings are destroyed, the power grid takes damage. This can be healed, but essentially what you're always trying to do is prevent buildings being destroyed. Mechs heal at the end of combat, but the power grid doesn't, so you often end up blocking attacks on buildings with your mechs. The point is, buildings have a chance to resist damage. And this can be improved through abilities and essentially \"overhealing\" your power grid. But this is pointless. I doubt you could get the chance to resist damage above 40%, and even above 25% generally requires sacrificing other rewards. Which is really just pointless. The odds are still so low that the damage will be resisted and the consequences so harsh that you just don't want to be in that situation anyway. So I just don't think the mechanic is even worth having, and it's a black mark of randomness in an otherwise beautifully not-random set of mechanics.\n\nMy even more minor gripe is that the scale of the game just doesn't work great. The fact that you're fighting giant insects makes everything feel smaller, especially when you're against big flying wasps, which would be too big to fly. Thus, my brain at least has trouble imagining them as they're intended and just sort of slips back into thinking of them as insect-sized, or at least as more human-sized, with your mechs as armored people. If the enemies were more alien; less buglike, this wouldn't be so much a problem. Also, the scale of other things is off or inconsistent. Buildings and mechs are almost as tall as mountains. Trees come to like... where your mechs' shoelaces would be. It's hard to get a handle on how big everything's meant to be. And then add in conveyor belt squares in one zone, and it gets more confusing. These conveyor belts are as wide as the base of a mountain and can move mountain-sized mechs around. How? What are these for? I have to avoid thinking about it or it hurts my brain.\n\nBut neither of these are huge deals. The game is great. Runs are shorter than FTL runs, which reduced the stress considerably. Though there is less margin for error than FTL, so if you graphed the stressfulness of both games, they'd probably look quite similar.\n\nI'd basically recommend Into the Breach if you like FTL, if you like XCOM or Fire Emblem, if you like mechs, or if you like roguelites or roguelikes. I quite like all of these things, so I freaking love this game and will get many dozens of hours of very high enjoyment from it.\n\nUpdate after a few more runs: There is one additional gripe I have. The unlocks are based on achievements, with each squad having its own three achievements that'll give you coins for unlocks. Kinda like how ships in FTL had their three achievements. But you can also mix and match mechs from different squads. However, if you do this, that just makes that squad \"The Custom Squad\", which has its three achievements. So you're disincentivized from doing a custom squad quite quickly, in favor of the default squads. And I don't like some of the squads, or some of the mechs. This would be solved by giving each mech its own achievement to get. Then it would be more fun thinking of a squad to help you achievement hunt if there were one you were having trouble with, and let you make a squad that would lessen your dislike of a given mech. For example, putting a mech that shields buildings with the mech whose attacks chain through and damage buildings annoyingly.\n\nAgain, it's not a huge gripe, as I don't hate any of the squads I've unlocked (I have one left to unlock [though it sounds like the least fun <which is why I left it for last {so we'll see how I feel about that one}>]) to the point I don't have fun playing them, just less fun, and this method does mean more replay value as you're forced to achievement hunt elusive achievements singly rather than all together in a custom squad. And once you've done all the squad achievements, custom squad away!", "timestamp_created": 1520378961, "timestamp_updated": 1520622712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40618071": {"recommendationid": "40618071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004824456", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520261855}, "language": "english", "review": "Into the Breach is a very well balanced strategy game. It's easy to pick up, and has the perfect level of difficulty. \nThe art style, music and interface is highly reminiscent of FTL, with some assets that look like they were pulled strait from FTL itself. The recycled feel is actually admirable to me in this case because it suggests that the two games belong to the same universe even though they play completely different and never claim to be related. It's somehow a sequel without being a sequel.\n\nI classify this as a rogue-medium game. what I mean by that is, some of your aquired abilities will be carried over into the next game, but you do have the opportunity to lose everything for your next game. My biggest problem right now is that exact rogue-mediumness. There are two conflicting strategies that come from it. \n\nstrategy 1:\nyou can sacrifice everything that could carry to the next game to maximize the progress you make through the current game.\n \nstrategy 2:\nyou can sacrifice your progress in the current game to maximize progress in a future game. \n\nThe strategies are in no way mutually exclusive, but I often feel like I have to go with strategy 2 because I can't find the perfect balance between the two, and I'm not good enough to finish the game from a fresh start.

However there is just no substence in this game yet for me to recommend it. After a single play through (about an hour long) you have been to every location in the game and have seen every enemy in the game. \n\nThere are 4-5 Islands in the game. Each Island is broken into into sections, about 8 or so. The islands differ in appearance for example a snow island or a desert island. But each section on the island is pretty indistinguishable from the others on the same island. From what I could see each island has about 4-5 different kinds of enemies including the boss. The enemies very only slighty from island to island.\n\nYou start with a set of 3 mechs and drop down onto the first island. You beat 5 sections (each section is a single fight) then you fight the boss section. The goal of each section is to survive a certain amount of turns and protect the buildings. The buildings represent the power grid of each island and each time a building is hit the power grid decreaes. When it runs out you lose. There are also bonus missions like kill a certain number of enemies or protect some building or whatever. Each of these side mission wil either give you more power for the grid, island reputation, which you use to purchase upgrades for your mech at the end of each island, or you get an extra power slot for your mechs. After that you move onto the second island, then the thrid, then the fourth. After you beat the fourth island you move onto the final island. You do 2-3 fights on that island then you win. As I said this all took about an hour for me to do. You can choose one of your pilots to move on then you do another run which is the same exact thing on the same exact islands. \n\nThe only way to make one run distinguishable from another is the set of mechs that you use. There are 8 sets of 3 mechs. So 24 mechs total. Each set is unlocked by doing achievements with your current set to earn coins that you use to purchase another set. All the sets seem to have a theme about them. For example one set focuses on shielding and another on fire. Each of the 3 mech in the set have different weapons and abilities. This is actually where the game shines the most. Some mechs fire a missle or a laser other mechs might not even do damage to enemies but simply push or pull them. This is the most fun part of the game, using strategy to figure out how to defeat the enemies with your mechs. You can buy upgrades or new weapons for the mechs at the end of each island and use the mech power slots to use them. However the upgrades and different weapons are not interesting. Never have I seen a weapon or upgrade in the shop that i thought was better than what the default equipment is. The upgrades for things like health are pretty limited. Each mech starts out with around 2-3 health and by the end of the run you can only increase it by 2. You can also only increase damage by 1 point most of the time.\n\nUnlike FTL there are no random events or diffenent paths you can take that make each run unique. The only random thing that happens is a pod that sometimes drops in battle. The pod carries weapons, pilots, etc.\n\nI think with more locations, more enemy variety, and something like events to spruce up each run would break up some of the monotony of sameness in each run.\n\nThat being said the game looks amazing. The mechs, the enemies, the menus, and especially the ui. Hovering over an enemy shows you exaclty what it is going to do and where, hovering over an ability gives you an example of how that ability works.", "timestamp_created": 1520372304, "timestamp_updated": 1520456907, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40616587": {"recommendationid": "40616587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014813010", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 53, "last_played": 1520625470}, "language": "french", "review": "Passons sur les points que les autres \u00e9valuations vantent :\n- Pas de RNG, except\u00e9 lors de la phase de d\u00e9ploiement\n- un tactical \u00e0 la xcom/advanced wars\n- une profondeur strat\u00e9gique qui n'est pas sans rappeler les \u00e9checs (comparaison abusive je trouve, m\u00eame si le jeu de la position est vraiment bien pens\u00e9)\n\nTous ces points sont vrais, et justifient d\u00e9j\u00e0 l'achat de ce jeu.\n\nAlors je vais juste rajouter quelques pr\u00e9cisions qui me font fondre :\n- le background  \u00e0 la \"edge of tomorrow\" pour justifier la replayabilit\u00e9\n- on dirige des Mechs contre des kaiju\n- les clins d'oeil \u00e0 FTL\n\nquelques d\u00e9fauts/qualit\u00e9s?\n- moins riche que FTL mais plus accessible (et plus agr\u00e9able pour moi)\n- des graphismes classiques qui auraient  pu \u00eatre plus travaill\u00e9s tout en restant en pixel art, mais qui ont l'avantage de la visibilit\u00e9\n- des sets de Mechs qui sont de puissance et d'approches tr\u00e8s h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e8ne, ce qui les rends tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 tous cerner, mais il y en aura certainement plusieurs qui vous conviendront...

The menus and the loading screen are all very familiar.\n\nThe gameplay so far is very fun. It's never tedious and you can continue to find new ways to deal with the Vek my ways of mech upgrades, new pilots, new weapons, etc. There are lots of different ways to tackle each stage, and it's always interesting, despite all the stages being the same size, and them re-hashing old stages later on. ie: blow up the dam 2-3 times during a play through.\n\nSomehow this doesn't seem to take away from the core gameplay (yet). I would like to see more stages of varying size, and a greater bestiary of enemies to deal with. Some larger and more difficult bosses could really add to this game.\n\nIt's a great game, and as a big fan of FTL, I'm certain I will get my money's worth out of this title. As it is now, I don't believe it has the replay value of FTL yet, but neither did FTL until the Advanced Edition came along.\n\nThese are great devs, and they look after their products with patches and expansions.

case of a game that hype train will do more bad than good and might even bring some hate bandwagon coming.\nIt is not bad at all and gameplay idea and execution are excellent - small tactical turn-based strategy, where you obliterate enemies while using mechs or envintorment is really fun and with small maps being randomly generated, it gives a lot of replay value. It feels like a great puzzle game.\nThat aspect of the game is perfectly executed, but there are issues, sadly.\nWeaponry is pretty disappointing and instead of being a progression, many of them feel rather arbitrary or extremely situational (like one use per battle), same goes for other upgrade thingies.\nSpeaking of upgrade, upgrade system is extremely limited, it feels almost half-baked. If you want to upgrade your mech, you need [strike]pokeball[/strike] cores, that cost 3 reputation points. Without perspective, it doesn't sound like much, but if you consider you can make 9-10 points per island on your best run, you can buy 3 cores. It wouldn't be so bad if not for the fact that with those 3 cores you will unlock +1 damage or some HP or +1 move for only one mech, and you have 3 of them. And that power is also necessary for weapons, too, so if you want to get new weapon (or any weapon for your mech, because there are types that don't have weapons) it makes upgrade system feel unbalanced. Upgrade doesn't feel like in FTL, where you got more power and kicked so much butt with your lazors of death and felt like da boss, because you upgraded. Here, resources are sparse, and most upgrades are situational or downright pointless (like a rocket that you can use only once per battle and requires 2-3 cores to run - now, how the heck you're supposed to work with that in the beginning or why would you want in the first place might be a good questions to be asked).\nIt's hard to explain to someone who didn't play it, but imagine RPG game which takes forever to level up, attribute points are extremely sparse and new abilities cost a lot. Or you go to the shop with nickel only to find out there are things mostly for a dime. Or imagine playing through entire FTL with 1 or 2 upgrades to your power meter.\nAlso, there are only 4 islands + 1 final boss island that you unlock once you beat 2 out of 4 islands. Why would you bother to beat all 4, when the final boss scales anyway? You could say for fun, but others might say why waste time - it would be like in FTL in sector 2 getting a warp straight to sector 8 and being able to beat the boss with your peashooter, because it scales to your level. It just doesn't matter.\nIt also misses some quality of life things, like for example repair - instead of just clicking repair and ending move of that unit, you have to click repair, chose that unit to repair and then it does it. Why is it made that way, when you can't heal other units, only yourself, I don't know. Other weird situation you might be in is killing enemies before time runs out - when you kill all enemies and have one turn left, instead of game ending the match automatically, because you killed everything, you still have moves to do or press end turn to end it. It is little rough around the edges.\nAlso, game lies to you - it says that when you will get power beyond grid meter, grid shield gets permanent upgrade, which is complete bull. It is not permanent - or rather, it is permanent, but only in the session you're already playing, meaning when your all dudes die, you loose that bonus.\n\nThankfully, the game just launched, so there is hope the game will get more balanced and get some more content (like more islands, weapons). \nMechs are fun and varied, story is non-existent pretty much like in FTL, but most important part, the gameplay, is great It's not worth 10, or even 9, but 8/10 sounds good enough. If they will work out all of the issues with balance and upgrade system, this game will be another smash hit.", "timestamp_created": 1520363527, "timestamp_updated": 1520625344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40613579": {"recommendationid": "40613579", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990273390", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 145, "last_played": 1521117736}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game", "timestamp_created": 1520362823, "timestamp_updated": 1520362823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493274", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40613568": {"recommendationid": "40613568", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980353210", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "last_played": 1520714098}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e, \u043d\u043e \u043c\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0431\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c.", "timestamp_created": 1520362797, "timestamp_updated": 1520362797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40613426": {"recommendationid": "40613426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034663346", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1521189039}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uae30\uccb4\uc640 \uc2a4\ud0ac\ub4e4\uc758 \uc870\ud569\uc774 \ubb34\uad81\ubb34\uc9c4\ud574 \ub9e4\ud310 \uc0c8\ub86d\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1520362356, "timestamp_updated": 1520362356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40613327": {"recommendationid": "40613327", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016988057", "num_games_owned": 690, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 142, "last_played": 1520551525}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is reminiscent of the Advance Wars series in many ways.

This game manages to do away with as much RNG as possible while still retaining enjoyable procedural generation. The theme of trying to save the world is created well by the graphics and music. The graphics make even these large mechs appear diminutive and part of a larger mission. The music is solemn and forlorn, reminding the player that the fate of humanity rests on their shoulders.\n\n[h1]Game Breakdown[/h1]\n[u]Gameplay:[/u]\nThe gameplay consists of using three mechs to defeat large insects known as Vek. It is the player\u2019s job to kill, push, pull, and zap the Vek. Combat is performed on a grid-based map comprised of cites, environmental objects such as mountains, and sometimes an optional objective. Combat is really smooth and feels quite rewarding. What makes it so unique is that the Vek will show how they will attack first and then the player is able to react to them. It is all the more painful to know that one has already failed instead of ever having a chance. The grid-based map is also what gives the game its chess like qualities. It is important to protect these cities as they are important to the overall meta-game.\n\nIt is important that the Vek don\u2019t destroy any city buildings as each on that is annihilated reduces the player\u2019s power supply. Power supply is what keeps the player\u2019s mechs moving. If it hits zero then the player loses as they can no longer defend against the Vek horde. Power is also a constant between missions and all of the islands where missions are held. This makes a player really think about how much power they are willing to let be destroyed so that optional objectives can be completed. Don\u2019t worry, power can be regained through completing optional objectives and buying it using reputation earned at each island. \n\nThe four islands each have a different theme that makes their battlefield unique. One island has pools of acid on random tiles that will lower the defense of any mech or Vek that stands in it. When an island is completed then the reputation points the player has gained by completing optional objectives may be spent on weapons, reactor cores which upgrade mechs and their weapons, and power to fill a player\u2019s power supply. Unwanted weapons and pilots can also be sold to make reputation. This system once again reinforces the fact that players must make difficult decision on whether they want to finish optional objectives to buy something, or instead complete the main objective only without power damage.\n\nMechs can be run by the AI, but it is best to have an actual human pilot. Pilots gain experience and level up performing actions during combat. Abilities gained from level ups are randomly generated, so finding the best mech pilot is part of the fun. There are also unique pilots who have special powers and have their own dialogue to flesh out their characters. One of these unique pilots is available at the start of every \u201crun\u201d and more can be unlocked later. Pilots can be lost however as they die when a mech\u2019s hp reaches zero. \n\nMechs come in different classes and are better with different weapons. An example would be that flying mechs are able to traverse water tiles without having their weapons disabled. There are eight teams of mechs, seven of which can be unlocked, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. These mech teams each have their own set of challenges which provide coins used to buy new mech squads. Each mech starts out with one weapon and can equip a second one. These weapons may require power or may only have a set amount of uses. \n\nMost weapons will either be gained by buying them with reputation or picking up time pods that randomly appear on mission. Mechs and the weapons equipped on them can then be upgraded with power that is installed using the aforementioned reactor cores. These upgrades can range from simple damage upgrades to providing entirely new functions to weapons. The mech customization is the part of the game I had the most fun with. Into the Breach gives the players lots of choices, and choosing which mech gets the extra power can make or break a run\n\nOverall, Into the Breach is an amazing turn-based strategy that is a must buy for any fans of the genres. While the game creates a lot of choices for the player to make, every single one of them feels impactful. Finding a crazy solution to a mission is one of the most satisfying gameplay experiences I\u2019ve had in a while.\n\n[u]Story:[/u]\nThe story is one of time travel. The distant future was destroyed by the Vek, so our brave mech pilots must travel to the past, or \u201cBreach\u201d, to defeat the Vek as they just start to appear. While the story isn\u2019t fleshed out very much, it creates a great theme for the game which every other part of the game supports. The desperate struggle for humanity\u2019s future isn\u2019t a unique plot, but it creates a great, solemn atmosphere \n\n[u]Sound:[/u]\nThe sound of this game\u2019s weapons are satisfying to use and aren\u2019t obnoxious. The sound design for the enemies is where Into the Breach really shines. Each enemy has a different set of sounds that all sound so perfectly insectoid. The sound really makes the Vek feel like living creatures that would scare anyone who saw them. The music is another sound aspect that is well designed. It is solemn and reminds the player of the importance of their actions.\n\n [u]Graphics:[/u]\nThe graphical style is pixel art and it works very well. Due to the scale of the Vek and the mechs, we are given a zoomed out version of the world so there isn\u2019t much detail on each individual object. Mechs and different Vek are easily recognizable however and I never felt confused. The graphics are quite static though, which I didn\u2019t find a problem but it may be for some. The mechs don\u2019t have unique animations for each weapon or attack. A pushing attack may have a mech\u2019s graphic slam into a Vek without a lot of motion. The idle animations of waiting units are pleasant and the graphical effects associated with weapons are also enjoyable.\n \n[u]Performance:[/u]\nThe game ran great and there aren\u2019t even any loading times. After selecting a mission, the play field zooms right in and there is no wait time. This fits with the theme of urgency but also is just satisfying to not have to wait constantly on loading screens.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[u]Pros:[/u]\nGreat Gameplay\nAmazing Use of Theme\nFun Challenges\nDiverse Mechs and Weapons\nLots of Meaningful Choices\nMeaningful Meta-game\n\n[u]Cons:[/u]\n\u201cSimple\u201d Graphics\n\n[u]Rating[/u]\n[b]9/10[/b].\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1520359822, "timestamp_updated": 1520394026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40612249": {"recommendationid": "40612249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065493240", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "last_played": 1521311414}, "language": "french", "review": "Une tr\u00e8s bonne initiation aux tacticals, qui n'en reste pas moins exigeant.

turn-based strategy is probably my favorite genre. It didn\u2019t occur to me until recently, but my time spent with Invisible Inc, XCOM, Darkest Dungeon, and other slow-paced, cerebral titles accounts for some of my best gaming experiences. Now I can add Into the Breach to that hallowed list, not merely because it belongs next to other greats but because it helped me reach this realization. This is one of the few games I could easily play indefinitely, testing new permutations of strategy and risks thanks to an absolutely brilliant confluence of design.\n\nThe world has ended, and you have failed it. The monstrous insects known as the Vek have destroyed the last vestiges of humanity, but all is not lost for you can slip through temporal breaches into new timelines where there is still hope. Commanding a team of three pilots and their giant mechs, it\u2019s up to you to stop the invasion you couldn\u2019t stop before. As you save cities and islands from the crawling onslaught you\u2019ll earn the trust and aid of corporations, offering you new weapons and upgrades to support your strikes against the invaders. Once you\u2019ve secured enough resources you can take the battle to the Vek hive and attempt to save the timeline once and for all.\n\nOf course, if you fail there are always other timelines. Into the Breach isn\u2019t a roguelike but it has a similar structure, where every game has some slightly randomized elements due to existing in a new timeline. I\u2019m always a fan of integrating story with game systems and the structure of saving or abandoning timelines as you work through new runs of the game is extremely clever. So too are the related systems like being able to carry a victorious pilot forward to the next timeline, or locating time pods during battles that contain valuable new resources for your efforts. The presentation here is top-notch, pitched and melancholy at just the right degrees, thanks to this unified foundation.\n\nAs genius as the premise is, it\u2019s the gameplay that makes this one stand apart. Each mission takes place on a small, gridded battlefield between your three mechs and whatever the Vek can throw at you. All you have to do to win is survive usually five turns, after which the giant insects get so disheartened I guess they give up and go home. But it\u2019s not just about your mechs surviving, because each map has buildings that form the local power grid. This grid is essentially your life bar, and if too many buildings are toppled by the monsters, you lose. New Vek burrow up from the ground almost every turn, too, so it\u2019s imperative that you keep up with their attacks and find some way to counter them.\n\nThe thing is, you get to see attacks coming before they happen. At the beginning of each turn, the Vek make their moves and prepare to attack with giant mandibles or acid globs or whatever else they have cooking. After that, you get to use your three mechs to mitigate as much damage as possible to the grid, your objectives, and yourselves. It\u2019s not a straight shootout either, because most weapons can push or pull enemies, too. Because of how enemies work and how short missions are, you\u2019ll soon find most of your strategy revolves around moving enemies away from their targets rather than killing them. After all, you can move an attacking Vek next to another Vek to make them hit each other, or put something atop an emerging Vek to stop it from joining the fight, or just smash them into each other for extra damage.\n\nThis one brilliant twist is enough to give the game an entirely different complexion from most turn-based strategy. It becomes a puzzle game, where every turn you pore over your options trying to find the best use of your three mechs against the approaching chaos. In many missions you won\u2019t be able to save everyone, leading to tough choices about what sacrifices to make. Losing grid puts you closer to failure, losing pilots can limit your tactical options, and losing objectives cuts down on your rewards. Staring at a turn for five or ten minutes and then finally figuring out the one safe path forward is an amazing feeling, and a big part of why this game succeeds in being so engrossing and gratifying. But it can also be stressful, and if you forget a key part of the situation or just end up trapped, that\u2019ll be the end of that timeline and a few hours worth of work.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to be prepared to fail now and then, especially with the game\u2019s open-ended difficulty structure. Each run plays out over four islands, each carved into multiple sectors. Sectors have different objectives that earn you grid power or currency if completed, and the more objectives present the harder the mission. Once you\u2019ve cleared two islands of the Vek menace you can opt to keep going, or attempt the final mission. If you keep clearing islands the final mission scales up, so the longer you go the more difficult it gets. Honestly it\u2019s a great way to make the game accessible to everyone, and serves as a good counter to the disappointment of losing a long or promising timeline. And I need to mention the dozen or so mech squads you can unlock through achievements, each so unique in its design that you\u2019ll hardly have any idea how to triumph with them until you try them out.\n\nThe struggle plays out in rich, clean pixel art reminiscent of the old Advance Wars games in the best way. You\u2019ll never have trouble seeing what\u2019s going on even when maps are burning, sinking, exploding, and melting all at once. The UI is just as clean, putting all the information you need right at your fingertips and featuring an incredibly clear and useful turn order list to help you plan your moves. The sound design is up to the task as well, though the soundtrack isn\u2019t quite as catchy as I was hoping in the wake of FTL. But what a minor complaint that is in light of how much this game gets right. Into the Breach has built an absolutely captivating system of strategy that manages to be thought-provoking and challenging without being the least bit confusing. Mastering the game is an exquisite joy from start to finish, and anyone with even a passing interest in mech tactics owes it to themselves to give it a try.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

Into The Breach challenges you to make the correct decisions with all the information available to you, and success or failure is all your own doing. There\u2019s nothing quite like making the player acutely aware of their strengths and weaknesses when it comes to a strategy-heavy joint.\n\nThe backstory is relatively simple. Extraterrestrial invaders known as the Vek have infested our world, and it is up to you and your trio of time-traveling mechs to dispense some justice. Battles take place on a small 8x8 grid, populated by important buildings, hazards, and natural impediments.\n\nThe Vek wants to destroy these buildings, which power you up, while you must do your best to protect them. Simple stuff, really.\n\nBut what is not simple is the persistence that carries over from battle to battle, island to island (four in total, and one more for the end boss). The power grid stays constant, while the difficulty, terrain, and species of monsters change up, forcing you to be on your toes at all times. Lose all power and you start again, with the caveat that you get to bring over a pilot (that is hopefully useful) to the next campaign.\n\nYes, there are certain side objectives in addition to killing all invaders that can reward you with power, reputation or reactor cores (which can be used for purchasing upgrades and such). However, it is always a risk to pursue them.\n\nDo you take the brunt of damage to save a building, or sacrifice it to land the killing blow on an annoying, acid spitting foe? With a variety of mechs in different squads at your disposal, the options to deal with the threats in Into The Breach\u00a0are substantial.\n\nThere are mechs that damage, some with abilities to teleport and heal, and some which can push or pull enemies from across the grid. Partner these with pilots with unique abilities of their own, and the potential is vast.\n\nThere is always an inherent risk of a wrong move leading to an unstoppable avalanche of damage that can cost you both a vital mech and a seasoned pilot. You truly have to master all the abilities to minimize the loss in each battle.\n\nThe Vek can be repelled by outrightly damaging them, pushing them into water/lava, smashing them against each other, or simply stop them from spawning by having your mechs occupy spawning points.\n\nEach battle is a chess game, albeit with the enemy movement made transparent to you. The sense of predictability is only overshadowed by the helplessness that can sometimes occur. While the enemy makes the first move, they stay committed as you plan yours.\n\nTime and planning will help you make the best decisions in order to stave off their relentless assault, especially when you factor in environmental hazards. Lightning can strike, lava will spew, and tidal waves can wash away precious squares for movement, all which happen in a set order that you can check. If you can survive a certain number of turns, the battle is yours as the Vek beat a hasty retreat.\n\nWith the wealth of information at your fingertips, the only deciding factor, oftentimes, is you and you alone. There are no hidden surprises or secrets, and no unfair difficulty spikes.\n\nYou know exactly what went wrong on your first or hundredth run, Into The Breach is painfully honest like that. And as a gamer, it can bring utter joy or downright disappointment as you venture towards ending the Vek threat.\n\nInto The Breach is a game both about the future and the past. As you plan out each move to counter each action of the enemy, you can be blessed or haunted by your past actions in previous battles carried forward. It requires you to be fully tuned for the duration of each one to two-hour run, and to cut your losses and savor the victories when you can.\n\nThis is a hard game, but only if you do not learn. It is a cycle of failure, learning, and hopefully, leading to success, and is utterly irresistible to pass on. Into The Breach is a perfect strategy game in manageable portions that you don\u2019t ever want to stop playing.", "timestamp_created": 1520352013, "timestamp_updated": 1520352013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40609404": {"recommendationid": "40609404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016026827", "num_games_owned": 813, "num_reviews": 127, "playtime_forever": 1170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 638, "last_played": 1521572783}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]8.5/10\n[i]\"Abstract modern Mechs vs. Bugs chess.\"[/i][/b]\nInto the Breach is a turn-based puzzle where you're in control over 3 pre-build mechs and their pilots (\"chess pieces\").

Not 100% though, good luck with that. \n\nIn many ways this game is similar to FTL. It's like subset games took random elements of FTL and put them in different places. For example, the ship power is now mech power.\n1 ship in FTL is equivalent to 3 mechs in the sense that the starting choice you make influences how you tackle missions, which missions you take and what upgrades you buy. The segmented damage bar of the ships now applies to everything. The art style is the pretty much the same which is a plus in my opinion. The music is the same but not as impactful. Heck there's even a final boss that's split into phases.\n\n[u] Gameplay [/u] \n\nIt is fun and very tactical, but to some the novelty might wear off after a while. It gets better as you unlock more mech squads due to the sheer variety of approaches each squad provides. Mech abilities can be combined in interesting ways either in combination with the environment or the placement of enemies/allies. Every squad I have unlocked so far plays differently and takes a while to get used to. \nIn terms of difficulty Into the Breach can really be a pain in the ass. I don't know if the emergence of the Vek each turn is random or if there's a pattern to it but sometimes the right Vek spawning at the wrong time can spell doom for you and your crew.\nI think the comparisons to Chess in other reviews are pretty apt but Chess has more justice to it. In Chess everything is there for you to see and if you miss a tactic or combination it's your own fault.\n\n[u] Music [/u] \n\nIt's a shame as there are a couple of really great tracks and I like the style of Ben Prunty's music but it just doesn't have the same weight. Every track in FTL is identifiable and has a unique character to it. In Into the Breach sometimes the music isn't even playing, whilst your sitting there visualising your plan in silence, although this might be a bug (literally).\n\nOne of the innovative things they have done is to make the achievements you get tie in with the gameplay. Achievements earn you coins which allow you to purchase more mech squads. \n\n[u] Summary [/u]\n\nI like the fact that you could run this game on pretty much anything, the file size is tiny and it only requires a mouse/trackpad to play. Also, you definitely get your money's worth. \u00a311 is great for the amount of depth Into the Breach has. Overall I'd recommend it and if you like unlockables or you're a completionist then go for it.", "timestamp_created": 1520349340, "timestamp_updated": 1520349340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

Each play though probably takes about 45 mins.

Its small number of islands is offset by good procedural generation, a varied roster of squads and foes that will make you wonder whether you could have handled situations in a better way or not. Failure will occur, but so will satisfaction, as you learn the ropes and figure out the different ways in which challenges can be dealt with. Its three difficulty levels make it approachable regardless of skill level. Where Easy is perfect for getting the hang of the game and learning to look for interactions beyond just direct damage, the challenge increases significantly on Normal and Hard. Add in a high degree of replayability, alongside playthroughs that aren\u2019t excessively long and which can be jumped in and out of at any time, and you\u2019ve a title that anyone with an interest in turn-based tactics should have on their radar.[url=http://www.noobfeed.com/reviews/1418/into-the-breach-pc-review Full Review[/url].", "timestamp_created": 1520333610, "timestamp_updated": 1520333610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541284", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40603651": {"recommendationid": "40603651", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175942154", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 242, "last_played": 1521172192}, "language": "english", "review": "Really cool game. Very addictive the way it works time travel to be part of replaying once you mess up. Its like if you got to keep a crew member in FTL each time you lose. The combat seems simple and easy at first glance, but choices become dificult to make if you dont manage the enemy right. I wish the sprites had a few more frames of animation and maybe more of a rogue like element to the islands and the order they go in but other than that I'm having a great time with this. i also found sometimes the Vek will make an attack move, but then a wasp will pop up blocking the vek's shot without you having to do anything.

lances un jeu, & plus tu avances, plus tu hallucines sur le souci du d\u00e9tail & la perfection du moindre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de gameplay. C'est rare. Je crois que la derni\u00e8re fois que j'avais \u00e9prouv\u00e9 ce sentiment c'\u00e9tait sur Inside. \n\nInto the breach rentre clairement dans cette cat\u00e9gorie. M\u00e9langeant des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de roguelike \u00e0 un tactical tour par tour \u00e0 la advance war, il offre une exp\u00e9rience unique, ou chaque tour de jeu est un casse t\u00eate savament dos\u00e9 pour se sortir d'une situation qui parait mal engag\u00e9e. La force du jeu r\u00e9side dans la grande lisibilit\u00e9 de son interface & le choix des devs de laisser le joueur r\u00e9agir aux attaques de l'adversaire. Tous les effets & d\u00e9gats sont connus \u00e0 l'avance, il n'y a aucun hasard dans la r\u00e9solution d'un tour de jeu. On est toujours confront\u00e9 \u00e0 des choix complexes ; prendre de la \"vie\" pour pas crever enc cas de coup dur, ou de la \"puissance\" pour avoir de mal sur les prochaines map ; \u00e9liminer 3 des 4 monstres pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 l'\u00e9cran, mais laisser le 4\u00b0 taper un batiment, ou n'en tuer qu'un seul, prot\u00e9ger les civils, mais prendre le risque d'\u00eatre d\u00e9bord\u00e9 au tour suivant... \n\nLe jeu est rapide ; une bataille dure 5 tours, si vous r\u00e9fl\u00e9chissez plus vitre que moi \u00e7a peut \u00eatre boucl\u00e9 en 5 minutes. \n\nL\u00e0 o\u00f9 FTL reposait sur beaucoup (trop) de hasard, Into the breach semble toujours vous laisser une issue & n'est jamais frustrant ou punitif. Les 3 niveaux de difficult\u00e9s permettent \u00e0 n'importe qui de s'y lancer, & je pense que c'est vraiment un jeu \u00e0 faire, que ce soit votre style de jeu ou non (comme il faut jouer \u00e0 Inside, m\u00eame si vous n'aimez pas les plateformers). \n\nA la fin de votre premi\u00e8re partie, vous vous direz \"ho lalala mais c'est dingue toutes ces possibilit\u00e9s\". Et vous n'aurez vu que 3 mecs sur les 27 que compte le jeu, tous avec des armes offrant un gameplay radicalement diff\u00e9rent. \n\nLa bande son de Ben Prunty est parfaite.

Your team of three units each have a specific role, and the second of 8 unlockable teams plays entirely different from the first. Tactics are mostly centered around defense, with offense often being a very strong defense. The game is similar to FTL in that the content is static, but the world is scrambled with multiple paths to the same end.

As long as you protect the power grid and fight your way through many varied bonus objectives with a nigh -on- endless amount of gear to find, pilots to save, styles to build, enemies to fight, and elements to weather you find yourself getting ever closer to saving humanity, at least in this timeline. \n\nInstantly the replayability is off the charts, comparable to slay the spire, or the binding of isaac, a game that once I start playing I don't want to put down. Run ended great? SWEET what new mech group can I unlock? or what new pilot did I save that run? Let's go test them out? Run ended bad? Man this play I made inadvertantly cost me my run, or this one thing I didn't realize was going to happen cost me because I was rushing, or I didn't use this piece of information correctly and it bit me in the behind. Let me dive right back in there and go again.\n\nThe game rewards and calls to the player that wants to try to improve themselves with each run, while at the same time discovering new techniques, units, and abilities that are an unlock addict's (such as myself) wet dream. It is the perfact marraige of solid gameplay, tactical soundness, having all the pieces laid out before you to puzzle out while at the same time doom is ticking above reminding you that this world needs you.\n\nAnd the soundtrack. It feels so...nostalgic and fresh. I wish i could purchase it myself and put it on my phone, but alas I'm poor. There is this overwhelming comfort that hits me right in the chest while playing this game.

You can come up with intricate, multi-stage plans and have them go off perfectly to decimate your enemies.

Having played many tactics games, all of that feels great.\n\nThe only issue is that the game can feel somewhat bland, because once you understand the systems you generally don't run into any particular challenges due to it being so fair. It's fun, but the highs and lows are also muted.

Good for a quick 5 minute round, but also something you can play for days. \n\nHow long do I take to unlock all squads?\n- It took me around ~47h to unlock all achievements / squads (I still don't have all hidden pilots)\n\nSo, once I unlocked everything, is the motivation gone?\n- You can randomly roll squads or create your own custom squad. Unlocking everything just means you're free to experiement more!\n\nDoes it get repetitive?\n- It's fun for a very long time, but one can't deny that battles do become repetitive at some point as 8x8 grids offer only just so many possible combinations. Also the enemy variety is limited since a lot of them are just the same enemies with slightly stronger abilities.\n\nIs it frustrating?\n- Yes, particularly when you start. It'll take some time to learn. Like in other Roguelikes the game sometimes puts you into impossible situations due to map/enemy RNG where it's all about cutting your losses.\n\nConclusion:\nDefinetely worth it's money.

Mistakes are usually caused by a simple lack of RAM in my brain, or forgetting something and making a mistake.\n\nIn Into the Breach, everything is always 100% clear. What your enemies will do, what they can do, where they will emerge next turn - what your abilities do. Thanks to hyper-polished UI and the stripping away of absolutely all and any fat from the system's bones, what's left is simply you and your brain to figure out the best solution with the tools that you have.\n\nAs a result, a single mission might take five minutes. An entire campaign could easily be finished in an hour. In XCOM, a single mission can take an hour, and leave you feeling bloated, like a heavy meal. In Into the Breach, missions feel like finger food - you have one, you have another, and you have another. They're delicious and you can stop at any time, feeling satisfied.\n\nDid I mention the unlockables? Every unlockable squad completely changes your toolset. What's brilliant is how each different squad, and the achievements associated with it, teach you new tactics. I wouldn't have fully-upgraded my Swap Mech unless it had been tied to an achievement - but when I did, I realised just how ridiculously powerful it was. With the Iron Judoka, I was forced to rely on using enemy's attacks against each other. After using them, I spot all kinds of opportunities to have enemies efficiently kill each other.\n\nThe achievements themselves give you coins to unlock new mech squads. You can play with the preset squads, built around a certain tactic, or make a squad of custom or random mechs. You have so much control to customise how you play, giving endless opportunities for silly challenge runs, which become so much more appealing with how fast the game plays. You don't even have to play every map in a campaign - once you're halfway done, you can immediately go to the ending, or complete the rest of the maps. It feels like the developers just lifted the arbitrary restrictions and said \"play how you want - it's your free time\".\n\nIf you found FTL to be impossibly hard, or if you are often turned off by the complexity of normal tactical games - give this game a try. If you also love the heavier tactical games like XCOM but fancy something you can fit into a lunch break, this might also be up your alley.

Every one of my runs so far I've had my Brute class mech outlevel my other mechs by 2 because it deals more damage and gets more kills.

The beginning of the game starts out rather slow but as you pick things up and learn the game it quickly becomes more and more enjoyable, just don't play on easy it has virtually no challenge and you'll be bored.\n\nUnfortunately I suspect the popularity for Into The Breach will die off quickly until they release mod support and additional content like FTL's Advanced Edition.", "timestamp_created": 1520287051, "timestamp_updated": 1520363351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40594827": {"recommendationid": "40594827", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036446332", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 533, "last_played": 1520792404}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, like chess but better!", "timestamp_created": 1520286692, "timestamp_updated": 1520286692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40594323": {"recommendationid": "40594323", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960871029", "num_games_owned": 376, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 221, "last_played": 1520995676}, "language": "english", "review": "So many people have died because of me.", "timestamp_created": 1520284752, "timestamp_updated": 1520284752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40594276": {"recommendationid": "40594276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004502855", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 266, "last_played": 1520712190}, "language": "french", "review": "100% streetvs, 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1520284609, "timestamp_updated": 1520284609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507154", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40594046": {"recommendationid": "40594046", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972257745", "num_games_owned": 620, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520202431}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably the best game I bought this year so far.

I have over a thousand hours into it, although several times all my ships and account history have been wiped out, so I can't prove it. I like FTL so much, I pulled the trigger on Into the Breach sight unseen.\n\nI bought Into the Breach the day it came out and have played it all weekend. It's absolutely fantastic. You start with three classes of mechs, and drop into something like a 10x10 or 12x12 grid, I can't remember. Each of your guys takes up one space. There are buildings around, which are important to protect from... numerous giant bugs that you have to distract and kill.\n\nYour mechs can do things like damage the bugs, shield buildings or guys, and push bugs or guys around. Picture this: a big scorpion is about to attack a building. You get your science mech behind him and gravity-suck him towards you. Now when he attacks the adjacent square, it's just empty space, instead of the building.\n\nSometimes the map has added features, like \"old\" tanks and artillery, that have limited functions, like shoving bugs or your guys around.\n\nIf they hit the building too many times, you lose the game. You start with like 5 or so hit points for buildings. If you protect the \"key building\" on most maps, you'll get another hit point. Early on, I was inadvertently shoving bugs into my guys or the buildings, which causes HP damage to both. You can also shove them into water squares and they'll drown (with the exception of flying or huge bugs).

Not of the year, but overall. No worries about micromanagement or crit-chances, you get damn near complete knowledge of just what will happen and how.

Initially limited choices like where to deploy actually have a bit of subtle strategy, weapons interact with different spaces in clever but logical ways (fire turns out to melt ice faster than normal, for instance), and the moderately limited variety of starting setups is enhanced by the ability to customize or randomize squads to create more interesting challenges for yourself.\n\nIt's not replayable in the same way that FTL is replayable, but I think that those who I've seen criticize it on that front are missing some of the point. It's easy to drop in and out of Into The Breach, and to have success easily. It'd be simple to play it with a friend. I believe I saw the designers compare it to a boardgame, and I think that comparison is very apt.

Ben Prunty delivers a damn good soundtrack like always and the artists did cool mech designs, character art and monster art. It really draws you in on all the levels you could expect the presentation to. The game is also good at communciating mechanics, what your actions will do, etc. the UI is very well-designed in general. What it shows is what you get, and every option and piece of info is easily accessed.\n\nThe core gameplay is also a really solid thing, both conceptually and execution-wise. You drop in your three mechs, you have three to five turns to preserve as many civilian buildings you can, as well as accomplishing various bonus objectives(protect this building for a reward, kill this many bad dudes, wreck this thing, stand here, etc.). To do this you've got a bunch of weapons that can move enemies around, damage them, move you around, inflict status effects or sometimes a combination of all three.\n\nAnd when it works, it REALLY works. It's going to feel sweet when you line up the alien invaders in a way where a single shot will bop three of them into the water and drown them, or when you untangle a particularly twisty tactical puzzle in a way that pulls off a perfect save.\n\nThe problem, though, is randomness. Not so much the roguelike randomness, though there's a bit of that, in that the amount of rewards you get, and which, are extremely random(on any given mission you might randomly get a \"time pod,\" and a couple of those early on can put you INCREDIBLY far ahead of the curve, because some of the weapon upgrades are MASSIVE power boosts. The game has no sidegrades, only upgrades. So you want these upgrades fast.), and that some maps play extremely well to certain teams and terribly for others(for instance, if you have one of the teams that has low damage, but many options for moving enemies, a map full of chasms and ponds to kill enemies with is a wonder. A totally flat map on the other hand screws you massively).\n\nNo, the problem is in the randomness of the enemy AI. Playing on anything but Easy(and even then, some of the time), you're going to have more than three enemies present. If four enemies decide to all pour on the same objective(or even civilian buildings, lose too many of those and you lose the game), and not helpfully bunch up in a way that lets you take out multiple of them with one hit? Then you've basically lost that objective with no recourse. On the other hand, if they all pour on one guy who can just side-step out of the way? Then they've given you a free turn to beat them around with.\n\nThe reason this is a problem is that enemy behavior is 100% random. There are no enemies that prioritize objectives over you, or vice versa, there are no maps where the enemy shows any awareness of the objectives and pursues them actively, etc. so the only way to prevent \"unwinnable\" turns is to always whittle the enemy down to less than your number... which you don't always get the option to. Again, because of randomness in the maps, in enemy spawns(are they all brick shithouses or flimsy 1-HP enemies? Totally random!), in the drops that determine your combat ability, etc.\n\nFor this game to get an upvote from me, it would've needed either a longer, hand-crafted campaign(so every mission was a genuine puzzle, set up with certain solutions, options and balancing) or actual enemy AI that prevented their completely RNG AI from sometimes making missions impossible and gave you another thing to take advantage of(thereby offering more tactical depth).\n\nOh, and speaking of RNG. Almost everything in Into the Breach is deterministic. An action will ALWAYS have a given outcome, a given amount of damage done, distance moved, etc. there are no hit and miss chances. Except for ONE thing, which is that when the enemy attacks a civilian building, it has a random chance to fail. I'm not sure why they kept this in.\n\nSo, yeah, long story short. Contains bad randomness, stupid AI that's somehow more pointlessly challenging than intelligent AI because it coughs up unwinnable scenarios sometimes, and a severe case of winning-gives-you-more-winning(i.e. you get more rewards for doing well, so a flubbed early mission or two can prevent an unwinnable run with little chance to turn it around, while doing really well early on can give you an unlosable run where you hardly even have to pay attention).\n\nReally wish I could recommend the game, because there's obviously a lot of love poured into the design. Just wish there was as much love and effort poured into the gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1520269864, "timestamp_updated": 1520269864, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500181", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40589442": {"recommendationid": "40589442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092647793", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1521196505}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice little game.", "timestamp_created": 1520268622, "timestamp_updated": 1520268622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40589332": {"recommendationid": "40589332", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970868458", "num_games_owned": 474, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "last_played": 1520611409}, "language": "english", "review": "What a great successor to FTL - but damn, thats hard, even on normal difficulty.\nWould recommend it if you like'd FTL like games", "timestamp_created": 1520268273, "timestamp_updated": 1520268273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40588855": {"recommendationid": "40588855", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992137412", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 45, "last_played": 1520904908}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing turn based tactics game.

The removal of requirements appearing at random is something Subset Games also has applied to FTL later on by allowing you to unlock all of the ships with victories rather than relying entirely on random events, something I approve of entirely. I would much rather set a goal and be challenged by its difficulty rather than grinding through a game hoping to find a series of random occurences.   \n\nInto the Breach is by no means a second FTL, it has its own, very polished, gameplay.

Ofrece al jugador cientos de posibilidades, ya sea al personalizar a tu equipo, en el campo de batalla, cual ser\u00e1 la siguiente fase, o INCLUSO LA DURACI\u00d3N DE LA PARTIDA. Hay un mont\u00f3n de equipos donde escoger y cada uno tiene mec\u00e1nicas y sinergias propias, pero incluso eso lo puedes cambiar, y coger un equipo con mechas aleatorios, o crearte t\u00fa uno propio (puedes poner incluso al mismo mecha 3 veces...).\n\n-En cuanto a la dificultad, creo que en normal es lo suficientemente desafiante y divertido como para ser el \u00fanico modo de dificultad, pero tiene el modo f\u00e1cil para los primerizos en los juegos de estrategia o para jugar una partida de relax, y un modo dif\u00edcil, que simplemente es un desaf\u00edo extra para cuando ya te has pasado el juego.\n\n-Es muy f\u00e1cil aprender las reglas y jugarlo, aunque tambien tienes que estar pendiente de varias cosas, pero puedes tomarte todo el tiempo que quieras, no hay contador ni penalizaci\u00f3n por ir lento, te invita a tomarte tu tiempo, a pensar bien lo que vas a hacer, porque (y aqui viene un punto interesante) los pilotos de tus mechas tienen muerte permanente, y todas las ventajas y niv\u00e9les que te dan se van a la mierda si mueren.\n\n-Las partidas suelen ser cortas, pero se pueden alargar (y dificultar) a placer gracias a otra mec\u00e1nica interesante, las islas. Puedes ir al desaf\u00edo final despu\u00e9s de haber completado 2 islas, pero puedes seguir hasta completarlas todas, lo que har\u00e1 que la dificultad vaya aumentando a la vez que lo hacen tus mejoras y tus pilotos. Esto ofrece otra capa m\u00e1s para pensar, ya que tienes que decidir si quieres seguir haciendo islas para conseguir m\u00e1s recursos arriesgandote a que muera un piloto (o a perder la partida por completo).\n\n-Juega muy bien con el riesgo-recompensa (como puse antes con el tema de las islas), creando momentos tensos en los que o conseguir\u00e1s mejoras y objetos que te ayudar\u00e1n a pasar las siguientes islas (como las m\u00e1quinas del tiempo), o fracasar\u00e1s completamente y perderas a uno de tus mejores pilotos (me ha pasado...). Tiene otra mec\u00e1nica con la que si te pones encima del lugar donde van a salir enemigos recibir\u00e1s da\u00f1o (riesgo), pero atrasar\u00e1s su salida un turno (recompensa).\n\n-Podr\u00eda pedirle m\u00e1s tipos de islas, m\u00e1s objetivos, m\u00e1s variedad de enemigos, m\u00e1s mechas, m\u00e1s bosses, pero creo que es porque me ha gustado tanto que simplemente no quiero que se me acabe el contenido.\nCon lo que tiene por este precio (que adem\u00e1s te regalan el Faster Than Light por la cara) lo merece sobradamente.\n\nEl juego de estrategia m\u00e1s accesible, de los m\u00e1s desafiantes y de los mejores que he jugado.", "timestamp_created": 1520263245, "timestamp_updated": 1520263245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40587735": {"recommendationid": "40587735", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983427824", "num_games_owned": 438, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 78, "last_played": 1520761593}, "language": "english", "review": "It is an amazing game.

It borrows from the devs' prior game FTL in some meta structure elements, namely how things unlock and the rogue-like elements that generate each game from partly pre-determined and partly randomized sets. \n\nThe real hook here is the dedication to minimalism. While it at first appears to be fully a tactics game like XCOM or Fire-Emblem or the like, just with shorter 4 turn scenarios, the systems are all reduced to be very simple and easy to understand and there aren't that many variables you need to keep track of on a per turn basis. The end result is that the simplified tactics gameplay of each turn comes to resemble something a lot closer to a puzzle game than a traditional tactics game. By which I mean, there always seems to be a way to \"solve\" each turn so that you protect all civilian buildings, all objectives points, and take no lethal damage. \n\nThe brilliant thing about that, if you think about it, is that this is actually true of all games in this genre. Into the Breach just highlights this fact extremely well because it's stripped away most of the fat (there's enough stuff in the game to play around with however - new equipment and characters and such that helps to create more gameplay variance). \n\nThe game's narrative is likewise minimal, but it works. It's both minimizes a sense of loss, and also minimizes a sense of accomplishment. You're playing as a (at first) lone time traveler trying to save a doomed world, and when you die you just shift to a different timeline to try again. But when you succeed you . . . also shift to a different timeline to save another doomed world. It's great for an endlessly replayable game, but therein lies the rub. \n\nBecause one of the problems here is that ITB probably isn't endlessly replayable for most people. There's meat here, but you can strip most of it away pretty quickly, and there's nothing (so far) that encourages endless play. If you really dig the game the variables will add extra time to that clock, but it didn't take me long, once I got past the initial difficulty cureve, to realize that the variations on the core themes are only going to go so far here. \n\nBut overall and for the time you'll play the game, you're very likely to enjoy the heck out of it. So long as you enjoy either puzzle games or tactics games and want something medium sized to play for an hour or two at a time rather than a super long campaign or a quick coffee break diversion, it's a strong recommendation. Less so if you're not into those things, but it might be worth a gander if you want a good and simple intro to these types of games.", "timestamp_created": 1520251197, "timestamp_updated": 1520251197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588309", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40583877": {"recommendationid": "40583877", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962809381", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 192, "last_played": 1521289943}, "language": "english", "review": "Every night for the past three days I've gone to bed mulling over ITB scenarios and every night I've found new interactions I have missed.

It has great mechanics, interesting mechs and chemistry, and hours of fun gameplay, however, there are something that I think they can improve upon:\n\n- Get rid of the retreat system (Or atleast have it as a challenge). I always feel cheap just delaying the Vek to the 5th or 4th round when they would completely demolish my mechs and grid. I don't want an endless gauntlent(Although that would be fun) I think that the 5th or 4th round should be when the Vek stop reinforcing.\n\n- Make the A.I. smarter with the enviornment. I want to feel like I'm fighting a war against an evolving and adaptable enemy. I think in the first island they should be normal but in later islands I don't feel like the Vek should be completely unaware and helpless against natural disasters after 3 islands, you would think that after you have captured 2 islands (which takes time in game) that the Vek on the other islands should have coping mechanisms or be somewhat aware of the enviornmental damage.\n\n- I would rework the final fight since I feel that it's a little underwhelming since it's like every other mission, but a little bit harder.\n\n- The last thing that I think would make the game harder are challenges. It gives you some sort of handicap as an ulternate source for coins or score.\n\n-And a simple thing that I think would be fun, are adding situations. A situation would consist of a certain squad, that can mis and match mech types from all the squads, and the battle will always play in the same solvable way, like a puzzle. I personally don't think that these should do anything besides give your profile a completion star or something.\n\nI don't think that these updates are absolutely necessary and can probably be tweaked and improved upon, but either way I hope that Subset will continue to work on this game and become another classic like FTL.", "timestamp_created": 1520236542, "timestamp_updated": 1520237304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40580911": {"recommendationid": "40580911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035494578", "num_games_owned": 525, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 3624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2056, "last_played": 1521499732}, "language": "english", "review": "every turn is like a little puzzle. it's like crack", "timestamp_created": 1520235848, "timestamp_updated": 1520235848, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40580347": {"recommendationid": "40580347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034064318", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 354, "last_played": 1520636140}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like beating up giant aliens using a variety of wildly differing mechs while defending human civilization from ultimate extinction, then this game is for you.", "timestamp_created": 1520232988, "timestamp_updated": 1520232988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40580303": {"recommendationid": "40580303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147922087", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520232754}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is truly amazing, it is also the first game I have ever done a review on Youtube with.

It is first and formost a puzzle game. Made by the developers of FTL, Into the Breach ascribes to many of the same design principles. Play with small numbers, make the mechanics known to the player, make multiple systems that while simple, interact with each other to provide a more complex experience. \n\nYou play as a small squad of timehoppers, piloting advanced mechs in order to defeat the bug-like vex menace. Each turn the aliens will move, and you will see their attack actions. On your turn it's your job to reposition them to save civilian populance, or kill them outright.  In adition to shooting them for damage, you can knock them into other enemies for damage, knock them into damage tiles, drown them, even reposition them so they'll murder each other. \n\n[h1]Gameplay; [/h1]\n\nThe gameplay basics, just like FTL, are very simple. Putting them into action is often much more difficult. I call it a puzzle game because there's often only one \"right\" move you can possible make in order to save the grid (your lifebar) In addition to the starting enemies, you'll see the burrowing locations of enemy reinforcements, and you can delay or stop them outright by blocking them with either your mechs or other enemies. Each mission also has bonus objectives, from killing X amount of enemies, to using a terraformer device to make desert. There's special tiles that have different effects, like forests that can be set on fire, or ice blocks that be destroyed into water. The game can also be severly punishing. You often won't see a wrong move until the next turn happens and you're overwhelmed by the enemies. Unlike FTL there's very little free cruising: you're either barely scraping by with most or all the objectives complete, or you're dead. Your first couple of hours with the game will be brutal and unforgiving. Still, there's a lot of triumph when you manage to change what looks to be an impossible situation to shifting the tide in your favor.\n\n[h1]Graphics [/h1]\n\nThe pixel-art aesthetic from FTL hasn't changed drastically, and still looks good on ITB. The animations are simple, the enemies (mostly) visually distinct from each other, and the UI is functional and shows pertinent information easily.\n\n[h1]Sound [/h1]\n\nThe soundtrack is good, fans of FTL's soundtrack will like this game's. I don't know what else do say about it, other than it's less synth with more guitar and more oppressive in terms of feeling compared to FTL.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion [/h1]\n\nHonestly, this game is incredibly stressful for me, probably because it actually requires good critical thinking and effective resource management. Unlike FTL, where your biggest enemy is RNG, in ITB the biggest enemy is you, the player for making bad mistakes. There's still a bit of RNG involved, unfortunatally I feel like way too much of the mission is decided on the success of your first turn, and enemies that web units tend to really fuck you up.  I want to again emphasize that ITB is a puzzle game. Fans of advanced wars, fire emblem, and all those other SRPG games will probably not find it as enjoybable, or may be expecting something completely different. \n\n [h1]8 / 10 [/h1]\n+Fairly Unique Gameplay\n+Good Aesthetic\n+Replayability  (Plenty of different weapons and mechs. acheivements, custom squads)\n+Unlike FTL there's no gatekeeper that will destroy your run if you haven't been successful enough (No flagship equivlant)\n\n\n-Small maps tend to make enemy movement ranged irrelevant\n-Too much is determined by the started round\n-Some mission objectives are absolutely awful\n-Deep down we wanted a ftl-ish mech tactics game", "timestamp_created": 1520223414, "timestamp_updated": 1520223474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 93, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.868753", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40578424": {"recommendationid": "40578424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205620640", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1559, "last_played": 1521639074}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like chess but with mechs.", "timestamp_created": 1520223342, "timestamp_updated": 1520223342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40577861": {"recommendationid": "40577861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032111168", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 732, "last_played": 1521568898}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game.

Similar to FTL you have a large number of starting options that you unlock as you play. Additionally rewards, pilots, and stores are semirandomized. Though both games have a ton to offer, Into the Breach differes by articulating every single outcome. Enemy actions are anounced before they act so you can truly plan around them. Sometimes the game is less about winning and more about surviving and it truly captures that feeling. Often you will have to chose whether to let a mech pilot die or take on your city's health bar which persists throughout the entirety of the run. There are ways to heal this bar but they often heal in small amounts and either require you to spend reputation (the currency in the game) or complete mission objectives. The game truly captures the feeling of being stuck between a rock and a hard place and then forcing your mech into that rock to destroy it and the mech.

It's not glitch free, but for me it's run perfectly with no faults which I can't even say of TETRIS of all things these days. It has a wonderful visual style and is an interesting twist on the Tactical RPG genre that plays heavily with positioning and using your terrain above leveling. Some of the characters actually stand out in terms of portrait or dialog, the first time I've been okay with playing Grizzled old men but I've also unlocked a girl who I enjoy. The controls are simple, the variations of units and pilots are complex. It can feel a little samey sometimes, but if you enjoy the gameplay then you won't be bothered by it. \n\nSome people's only experience with Tactical RPGs is Fire Emblem, or some other game, and they think that's the entire genre; that no other game is like that. If you're someone who likes Tactical RPGs then this is a very worthwhile addition to your library. It even has options that many Tactical RPGs are honestly missing like speeding up combat animations and the ability to LIGHT EVERYTHING ON FIRE. BURN. \n\nIt's a very good game, even for someone who's not into rogue-like/rogue-lite games. If you play Fire Emblem, Super Robot Wars, FF Tactics, Disgaea, Front Mission, etc you'll probably enjoy it. If I had to compare it to anything though, I'd say Vanilla Fire Emblem Heroes where once everyone was the same level it was all about positioning. \n\nThe biggest flaw imo is tha customization is a little weak and it could use deeper lore, but all in all it's a fun game.

But if you don't love either of those, I still think this is a game that most people can get behind. It's simply designed, and easy to get started in. It's elegant but unique combat will keep you coming back to play some more, even after your favorite character dies. Not to mention the amazing soundtrack by none other than Ben Prunty (who, by the way, makes other music that's also great if you like this, it's on spotify, check it out). This game is nothing short of great, and overall, I'd give it a [b]9.5/10.[/b]\n\n[list]\nPros\n[*]Great, unique visuals\n[*]Neat story\n[*]Fun, creative, environment based combat\n[*]Does a good job at getting you attatched to characters\n[*]High replayability\n[*]Plenty of content\n[*][b]AMAZING[/b] Soundtrack, can't stress that enough\n[*]A pleasant familiarity factor for FTL fans. It's not an FTL clone, but it has that Subset Games charm, which is very nice\n[*]Easy to pick up\n[/list]\n\n[list]\nCons\n[*]It's one of those games (in my personal experience, yours may vary) that you play for 30 minutes to an hour at a time, and take a break.

When I beat this puzzle game I spent thinking about for hours I don't feel euphoric, I feel like I finally finished a maths assignment like if I was back in university and my head hurts a little. Both winning and losing feels anticlimactic. Because win and loss is predictable and calculated.\n\nI expected thrill in this game like in FTL, because the game advertises the correlation to it so blatantly. And that the game didn't deliver.

That's my opinion tough.\n\nIf I had to describe Into the Breach in two words it they'd be: ADVANCE. WARS.\n\nYeah that awesome game on the Nintendo DS which should see more love, more content, more everything!\nIt was just so fucking good.\nAhhh good ol' nostalgia ...\n\nEnough with that.\n\nInto the Breach is a charming and fun little game for coffee breaks, playing several hours or however you wanna approach it.\nThe maps are small, the units are small, the dmg you deal is small, your hp bar is small but not for long. If you're good. If not you're just gonna get to the game over screen faster than the Rift Walkers can find a new timeline to save.\nInto the Breach is a hard as nails, turn-based tactical strategy game but it's essentially just one thing: a puzzle.\n\nLemme explain. In order to win a battle you just need to survive for a certain amount of turns. Like four or five. So yeah you don't even have to kill every unit aaaand you don't even have to take care of your pilots since it doesn't reeeeeeaaaaaally matter too much whether or not your mech's piloted by a real pilot or by some robot. The only bonus you get is by leveling up your pilots and that's only possible if they survive a battle. Once they're down they're dead. That's it.\n\nYou can choose your starting island once you've unlocked them and the enemies get tougher and harder from island to island. So you can technically plan which island you wanna nuke the Veks out of first but I'm not too sure if it makes that much of a difference.\n\nSo here's how the battle system works. You essentially push the enemies around while dealing damage to them at the same time. The pushing part is really important. See the enemies always act first. And you also see what they're targetting and so on. So if you play smart you can make sure that they kill each other.\nOh and btw there are also some RNG events like storms or cataclysms. The areas that are gonna get hit by those are marked yellow. Enemies targets are red.\nYou can sit there and think about the best possible solution for your current puzzle and that could take some time.\nThe beautiful thing about that part is and what makes it so fun for me is that you're trying to find the best solution with the least drawbacks.\nSpeaking about drawbacks ... The grid. Oh how I love and hate the grid. Your mechs are powered by it. What this means is that once the power reaches zero you're done. Better luck next time.\nHere comes the stressful part. You have to make sure that the enemies don't destroy the grid by damaging the houses on the map.\n\nYou see there's a lot of stuff to plan out before you're making your move.\nAnd even if you utterly fuck up ... You can reset one turn per battle. If you notice that you've done a grave mistake you can just reset your turn and try again.\n\nDuring the course of your run you can also upgrade your mechs by spending reputation which you've aquired through objectives.\n\nAaaaaaand once you meet your death you're then able to choose one of your pilots to use him in a new run.\n\nThat's pretty much the whole game.\n\nQuick facts:\n\nPuzzle. Push and damage enemies. Defend the grid. Upgrade mechs. Die. New timeline. Don't compare it to FTL.\n\nIt's well worth it people and really, really fun.\n\nNot to mention time flies when I'm playing it which is also quite nice.", "timestamp_created": 1520197195, "timestamp_updated": 1520197938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.808358", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40572516": {"recommendationid": "40572516", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967424242", "num_games_owned": 516, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 221, "last_played": 1521681035}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoy this game.

Unlike others I've been motivated to go back and try to win with different mechs/strategies, although I can see how the gameplay can get repetitive and easy if you know what you're doing (Hint: If you think you have enough grid power, get more grid power).\n\nPerhaps for some people this game is worth closer to $5 than $15, but I can't complain considering the amount of hours that I've already enjoyed and plan to enjoy with this game. I can't see this game being hundreds of hours of repeatable gameplay, but however long you decide to play it, it should be an enjoyable experience.", "timestamp_created": 1520194994, "timestamp_updated": 1520194994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40571679": {"recommendationid": "40571679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146494634", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 31, "last_played": 1520484689}, "language": "english", "review": "I love FTL and I love this.

At its core, Into the Breach is a grid and turn-based strategy game that will force you to use the environment to your advantage. There is a lot of pushing, pulling, blocking and using chain reactions in this game, which is a very welcome change from the usual clinical damage calculation of these titles.\n\nYou control three mechs and you need to defend your planets from the invaders, one zone at a time. Usually the objective is to protect your building from damage for a set number of turns with some bonus objectives sprinkled on top. There are a lot of unlockable mechs, which is the part of the game that's going to keep you playing beyond the first few hours. The squads are very different from each other and have interesting synergies that you can exploit. Furthermore, like FTL, you can assign power slots to your units and change their weapons and abilities before the battle depending on your needs.\n\nInto the Breach does not have the longevity of a true roguelike, but it's a fun, strategic game that will challenge you to find the most creative solution to survive each turn.\nThe pixel art is nice to look at and will not distract you from the action; the soundtrack is a little repetivive but has that retro sci-fi vibe that fits very well with the theme.\n\nThe main shortcomings are the relatively low map count, low replayability if you don't care about unlocking other mechs and lackluster story. \n\nIf you feel like the value for money is too low at 15 euros wait for a sale.

Reinventar un g\u00e9nero como la estrategia t\u00e1ctica por turnos no es nada sencillo, y menos cuando la influencia m\u00e1s cercana que se siente de este Into the Breach proviene del exponente m\u00e1s cl\u00e1sico imaginable: el ajedrez. Y es que el n\u00facleo del nuevo t\u00edtulo de los creadores de FTL es una reinterpretaci\u00f3n del g\u00e9nero desde sus bases m\u00e1s primarias, y d\u00e1ndole la vuelta de tuerca justa para hacerlo sentir novedoso pero a la vez con una solidez innata, que no reduzca el resultado final a un experimento extra\u00f1o. No titubeo al afirmar que es uno de los mejores t\u00edtulos de estrategia que han salido recientemente, y m\u00e1s si nos centramos como digo, en su n\u00facleo jugable, pero como dir\u00eda Jack el Destripador: vamos por partes.\n\nLa humanidad est\u00e1 siendo amenazada por una invasi\u00f3n de Kaijus enormes denominados \"Vek\", y solo los escuadrones de Mechas que tendremos que dirigir parecen ser la soluci\u00f3n a este problema, pero el camino para erradicarlos ser\u00e1 complicado, y nuestra tarea no solo consistir\u00e1 en matar a tantos como podamos, sino tambi\u00e9n defender las ciudades e instalaciones a nuestro paso para que las defensas globales no caigan a cero. Si se da ese caso, uno de nuestros pilotos abrir\u00e1 una brecha temporal y volveremos a intentar una vez m\u00e1s la salvaci\u00f3n de la humanidad. Esta es la premisa del escenario de Into the Breach, y no hay mucho m\u00e1s que nos deba importar en torno a un argumento que es de lo menos importante en este juego. \n\nUna de las cosas que s\u00ed deb\u00e9is recordar en torno al anterior p\u00e1rrafo es este: habr\u00e1 tanto que matar a los Vek como defender las ciudades, y es aqu\u00ed donde radica uno de los mayores atractivos de Into the Breach. A diferencia de otros TBS, Into the Breach se centra m\u00e1s en la contenci\u00f3n de amenazas por turnos, y para ello nos valdremos de nuestros mechas y la combinaci\u00f3n de sus acciones, con el fin de aguantar un turno m\u00e1s sin da\u00f1os. Por ello una de las mec\u00e1nicas m\u00e1s importantes ser\u00e1 la capacidad de desplazar a los Vek cuando atacamos o realizamos acciones. El desplazamiento y el movimiento en general es esencial para aprovechar todas las posibilidades que brinda un escenario, desde tirarlos al agua o al vac\u00edo, empujarlos contra otros Vek o monta\u00f1as y herirlos en el proceso, situarlos en la casilla donde caer\u00e1 un rayo, empujar una roca y cruzarla en el camino de un enemigo, desplazar un Vek a un bosque en llamas y calcinarlo... las posibilidades son enormes gracias al dise\u00f1o de los escenarios y las mec\u00e1nicas del juego.\n\nPero tambi\u00e9n ser\u00e1 importante desplazarlos porque tendremos que evitar que sus ataques alcancen aliados o ciudades, y aqu\u00ed entra en juego otra peculiaridad de Into the Breach: siempre sabremos qu\u00e9 movimiento van a realizar los Vek, y nuestra tarea ser\u00e1 alterar esos ataques para evitar cat\u00e1strofes o incluso hacer que estos jueguena  nuestro favor. Todo esto, junto a lo mencionado antes, abre un mundo de nuevas posibilidades, y es lo que hace de este juego algo tan especial. Cada nuevo turno es un nuevo problema a resolver, tendremos que gestionar nuestras limitadas unidades para intentar abarcar todas las posibles amenazas, o realizar jugadas conjuntas que demandan creatividad en nuestros movimientos, como de peque\u00f1os puzles se tratasen, oblig\u00e1ndonos a aplicar un pensamiento m\u00e1s lateral que otros juegos del g\u00e9nero, sin recurrir a aspectos de gesti\u00f3n de recursos y otros aspectos que el juego simplemente no necesita.\n\nHay muchos otros aspectos a comentar, desde una considerable cantidad de mechas, armas, personajes con habilidades, hasta una buena cantidad de misiones que nos otorgar\u00e1 bonificaciones si resolvemos con \u00e9xito, aunque su naturaleza \"c\u00edclica\" puede hacer que al cabo de unas horas pueda ser un poco reiterativo en sus objetivos, est\u00e1 bien planteado y compensa con el buen dise\u00f1o de escenarios, los efectos cambiantes de estos, y muchas otras sorpresas. Un run del tir\u00f3n por todas las islas de Into the Breach puede llevar a unas 2-2.30h de duraci\u00f3n, pero cr\u00e9eme que reintentar\u00e1s varias veces hasta llegar hasta el final. Es bueno tambi\u00e9n que se sienta un poco m\u00e1s accesible que el anterior juego de estos chicos: FTL, y auqnue no tiene la imprevisibilidad de aquel, s\u00ed gana en un sentimiento de control constante, en el que los errores son errores nuestros, y no los azares del destino.\n\nAs\u00ed que ya sab\u00e9is.

You will spend dozens of minutes (or hours) siting in front of your screen trying to figure what to do. But also with that you will have a ton of fun. Everything is generated so even if you finish the game you can just start over. Repetition is big player here.\n\nThis game is not story driven, it has actually very simple design in it's core but to master it - it will take a while. Just like chess.\n\nAlso Ben Prunty soundtrack ;)\n\nBig plus for this idea and execution. I absolutely recommend this game for all puzzle gamers out there.", "timestamp_created": 1520190018, "timestamp_updated": 1520190018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40570036": {"recommendationid": "40570036", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096658339", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520452560}, "language": "english", "review": "The most difficult thing in this game is to stop playing it :)", "timestamp_created": 1520189785, "timestamp_updated": 1520189785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40569986": {"recommendationid": "40569986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020485381", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520423300}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0434\u044e\u0448\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430. \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0437 \u043b\u0451\u0433\u043a\u0438\u0445, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0451\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c. \u041e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0435\u043c \u043a\u0442\u043e \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u0438. \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0451\u0442 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c \u043c\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0432, \u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u0442\u0438\u0445\u043e\u043e\u043a\u0435\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0436\u0430. \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043a. \n\u0422\u044b \u0432\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0437\u0430\u0448\u0451\u043b \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0447\u0451 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0438... \u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043f \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432.", "timestamp_created": 1520189642, "timestamp_updated": 1520189642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40569901": {"recommendationid": "40569901", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972920742", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 639, "last_played": 1521157639}, "language": "english", "review": "A beautiful game.

Brilliant gameplay, but there are several design choices that are questionable.\n\nThere are a set of 4 islands that you have to rescue, as well as a boss island that must be completed to end the game.  However, you only need to complete 2 islands to get to the final boss, and the final boss scales based on how many islands you complete.  I don't like this design choice, as it is usually better to go to the final boss after 2 islands instead of 3 or 4.  It also makes the playthrough a lot shorter.\n\nSecondly, there are hazards scattered across the map that have effects on allied and enemy units.  These include inflicting damage every turn or cancelling attacks.  Most units have abilities that can push other units to take advantage of these hazards.  However, water will simply outright kill a unit that falls into it.  In some instances, this can be the only effective way to kill durable attackers, which is rather 1-dimensional.  I would personally have liked to see methods of cascading damage implemented with more than 2 enemies colliding with each other after an attack.\n\nI think the power grid is an underdeveloped concept.  Based on power, I think giving bonuses to your crew would be an interesting dynamic.  It also would incentivise keeping your hp high.  As it stands, there is no difference between 1 grid hp and max grid hp other than additional grid damage is lethal.\n\nThe last complaint is that the game is too easy, even on hard difficulty.  The game tree complexity is limited, and that limits the number of possible moves you can make. The primary reason for this is that you can only really see 1 move ahead that the AI is doing, and you are unable to see which AI units are spawning on the next turn.  This means that you can only account for immediate threats, and cannot predict for long-term defense.  Positioning units in the center of the map helps, but is not ideal.\n\nThe good news is that mods can likely address some or all of these problems, and give yoy the specific gameplay you are looking for.\n\nNow, I've griped about all the problems this game has.

I'm not sure how big the pool they draw from is, but it's big enough that I've not had two runs feel 'the same'\nIf I've got one complaint, it's that the final mission basically [i]is[/i] the same every time. even then, though, how you need to approach it depends heavily on your squad and play up to that point (I've normally got ~40% grid resist by that point, so I tend to not be too worried)\n\nin all, people should stop comparing this game to FTL. apart from the fact that they're both roguelikes and made by the same people, they have very little in common mechanically.\nOn that note, if you're here just because you liked FTL, you may want to think a bit harder about whether or not this is for you. they are fundamentally different, after all.\n\nand there you go. not a

I got bored after 16. After enjoying FTL for 150+ hours, Into the Breach really is quite a letdown, even if you do enjoy the gameplay changes (more strategy and less rogue-lite). Here's why...\n\nIt feels unfinished. Over 50 possible coins from achievements, but everything you can currently unlock totals for less than 30 coins. There IS some variety but far less replay value than FTL. After 16 hours the game starts to feel like a phone app.\n\nThere are no quests, no shops, no random events with different possible outcomes depending on luck and your team / decisions. The maps are randomly generated but there aren't that many different objectives and everything starts to feel very samey after a while. What bothers me the most, though, is the scarcity of rewards and meaningful upgrades. I've finished the final battle with almost exactly the same weapons and setups I started with. FTL has sooo many different weapons and modules... there is very little of that here.\n\nThe mech squads play very differently but unlike the various unlockable ship types in FTL, some of the squads aren't fun to play and you won't know if you like them until you've already spent the coins to unlock them. This is a matter of taste and different gamers will prefer different setups, but I'd rather have all basic squads available from the beginning so I can try them out and unlock more advanced types of the same models. More unlockables overall. More weapons variety, more slots for passives, more... everything.\n\nAlso, I've no idea why the developer decided to let you advance to the final battle after 2 islands. Imagine if you could complete FTL after 2 maps, with the final battle scaled down in difficulty so you CAN win the game after 2 maps? Yeah.\n\nI haven't given up on it yet, but the game needs a LOT of content upgrades before I'll even consider sinking 150 hours into it.", "timestamp_created": 1520181009, "timestamp_updated": 1520181009, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 91, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546492", "comment_count": "20", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40566628": {"recommendationid": "40566628", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961415346", "num_games_owned": 2855, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1521493145}, "language": "english", "review": "There's no actual full screen mode right now, only window and borderless window.

I'm a little sick of the Roguelike thing, but it doesn't *strictly* apply to this game and the runs are usually so short that it's really more arcade-style strategy than \"Roguelike\"\n\nDefinitely worth the asking price so far.

It is your job as the player to defend these 4 islands from the Vek, an insectoid alien monster race, by completing a series of missions on that island that culminate in a final mission with a boss Vek.\n\nTo accomplish this task, you are placed in command of a 3 \"mech\" squad, with each mech having different abilities. The 'mechs' in Into the Breach vary somewhat from the typical definition, and include planes, tanks, artillery, drones, and the traditional humanoid mechs to name a few. \n\nAs you complete missions and beat the campaign with various squads, you will unlock new 3 mech squads with different theming and abilities that help you take on challenges in new and interesting ways.\n\nThe beauty of Into the Breach is in its simplicity. Each mech unit and themed squad has very defined strengths and weaknesses. They each require a different set of tactics to lay effectively, but at their core they are all based around a central idea, whether that is pushing around enemies, dealing a ton of damage, chaining damage through multiple adjacent enemies, or something completely different. It makes playing through the campaign multiple times a more varied and interesting experience.\n\nI would recommend this for anyone who wants to play a fun, casual tactics game that makes you think, but not too much.", "timestamp_created": 1520179719, "timestamp_updated": 1520179719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40565705": {"recommendationid": "40565705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015097919", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520209246}, "language": "english", "review": "Theres nothing else I can say that hasnt been said already.

I'm 12 hours into it so I'll write from that perspective:\n\n As a HUGE FTL fan, I was hoping for the same qualities that made it great to grace this game, and BOY DOES IT EVER. While being a completely different game, it feels very familiar. The unlockable elements, the perma-death, the ability to replay and replay and get a different game every time is what I love.\n\n The game features simple core mechanics, and adds layers, that can be used to form some interesting strategies. It's really not that unlike a Tactical RPG or Chess. I found it easy to pick up.\n\n I like that I can hop in for quick game. From clicking the icon to launch the game, it's mere seconds until you are into the battle.\n\n I was on the fence about getting this one as I didn't reeeally need a new game right now, but I'm glad I did. \n\n \n", "timestamp_created": 1520154296, "timestamp_updated": 1520154296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40556919": {"recommendationid": "40556919", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988273826", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 746, "last_played": 1521673118}, "language": "english", "review": "For clarification, I'm still at my first playthrough, so take with a grain of salt... but I f-ing love it. I already loved FTL and I love this too. The gameplay is tons of fun. The maps are small and have a lot of special tiles and conditions you need to consider, so it's very focussed. You see the moves your opponents are going to do one turn in advance and by special moves and attacks you can re-arrange them in a way they miss their target or even attack each other. Sounds easy, and it basically IS easy for a turn based tactics game veteran like me (on normal difficulty), but you have to think hard for the best possible outcome each turn and overwhelming numbers of enemies against your three dudes makes it challenging. \nEach mission you get 1-3 bonus objectives which give you upgrades, currency or power, which is basically your health.\n\nAbout power: this meter rises when you get it by a mission and falls EVERY time the enemies destroy a city tile on a map, which takes only one attack. So if that happens often enough, that is when you lose your current playthrough, but there is carry-over of pilots you find.\n\nUpgrading mechs between missions is a blast and you are highly flexible once you got some reactor power to spend. You can choose between moving more tiles, gaining more health, doing more damage or special abilities like charging towards an enemy for the melee based mech. That are just some poor examples, after freeing each island you get to spend your currency where you can buy new abilities and weapons, which allow you to freeze opponents or drop smoke on them so they lose their attack this turn. You  can detach reactor power and put it somewhere else if you want to shift your tactics.\n\nSo this game comes highly recommended from me.

It's really cool.\n\n\nNow I'm going to make a few comparisons between this, and their previous game FTL:\n\nFTL seems to be a bit more based on luck. While in Into The Breach, no matter how bad the situation is, you can bust your head to minimize the potential damage as much as you possibly can. Ofcourse you can do that in FTL too, but you are way more limited to how accuracy and evasion plays out. And the random events that you get with RNG. There are no such random events in Into The Breach other than randomized optional quests in each area.\n\nIn conjunction with that, FTL feels way harder and stressful (kinda in a good way) than Into The Breach (or I dunno, maybe I got used to tactical games). Case in point, I've achieved victory just in 2nd run in Into The Breach, while I had like 5+ tries until I got it in FTL.\n\nRisk versus reward management still feels the same in both games. \n\nI feel like it's way easier to unlock stuff in Into The Breach than in FTL. In FTL, you have to do specific challenges to unlock each ship type or gain a victory to unlock \"the next type\", in Into The Breach, you collect these \"achievement coins\" and spend them on any of the unlockables in any order you want.\n\nWith that being said, Into The Breach feels way more customizable as you can create your own custom squad out of pieces that you unlock. \n\nWhile in FTL if you are underprepared for the boss fight, you are dead meat. But that doesn't matter in Into The Breach, as final fight scales with your levels. \n\n\nThese are all the comparisons that I can think of right now. But keep in mind that despite both being very tactical-heavy games, they can't substitute for each other. Their gameplay are still pretty different, one is about mechs versus aliens on a tactical grid combat, the other one is about 1v1 space combat and  resource management. I honestly like both, but since FTL was the game that first introduced me to roguelike genre, I hold it closer to my heart.", "timestamp_created": 1520151686, "timestamp_updated": 1520188722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584677", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40556183": {"recommendationid": "40556183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025001368", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 233, "last_played": 1521005547}, "language": "english", "review": "Most I've enjoyed a game in a long long time.

Trying to keep this vague and spoiler free, the final level has a environmental effect you haven't seen before and the tooltip for it says \u201cLook out\u201d. However this effect varies, sometimes it will not harm your characters and other times it will insta kill them.

It's more of a puzzle game than anything. Replay value is relatively low and you can see all the features within an hour, but there's certainly still some fun to be had by trying out mech combinations and looking to clear the various achievements. It's no FTL, but then what is?\n\nIn Depth Review\n\nIs it worth the money?\n\nFirst and most importantly. \nThis game is smaller than I was hoping, there's only four islands and maybe...a dozen scenarios.  It could certainly be said to be an advantage that my biggest criticism is that there wasn't enough of it but I'm not sure if it warrants the pricetag. Then again, maybe Subset know this since for a first-time buyer you also get free FTL and so 15 dollars for FTL + ITB is actually pretty decent. \nBasically, each game takes maybe an hour at most and so if you have cash to burn ITB is a fine addition for a few hours of fun after work or school, so I'd give it a soft yes. \n\nGameplay\n\nIt's a lot more like a tactics game than a Roguelike. \nIt has a cool premise that fans of Pacific Rim or the Super Robot genre will instantly recognise as you take the place of a team of mech pilots fighting giant bug monsters. The game is divided up into four main islands and a boss fight island. Each island functions as a sort of mini-campaign map where you can choose between one or two missions. Once you've completed half a dozen or so missions you have a boss fight to defend the island HQ and then move on to the next island.\nEach mission is pretty similar in that they all end after you have survived for about five turns and invovles you fighting a handful of these giant bug monsters (Vek).\nDifferent enemy types have different special abilities; such as direct-fire ranged attacks, webbing your mechs to immobolise them, others will spawn smaller units, some function like artillery and can hit multiple targets. A lot of the tactical creativity comes from trying to pull or push these bugs monsters (Vek) into the path of each other's attacks. Most of the Vek will also die if submerged in water or lava, and so there's some cool moments of rocket punching giant spiders into the ocean for massive damage. There's also some limited environmental factors such as smoke or forests which can be lit on fire to damage Vek.\nNew Vek enter the map by burrowing onto the screen and so trying to block these tunnels before the Vek emerge adds another layer of tactics. \nEach mission will have a specific goal or two, achieving these goals grands you \"corporate favour\" which at the end of each island can be traded for power, more mech cores (to upgrade your mechs) or new weapons and accessories. There's regrettably not a lot of choice in scenarios. You usually need to protect a unique building or unit (trains are a very common one) or you might need to kill a certain super enemy. There are only a couple of more unique missions (smashing ice off cities, terraforming terrain).\nEach city will also inevitably have cities which you need to protect to maintain power. Each time a city dies your power grid is reduced and only certain missions will allow you to replenish it. If your power reaches zero you lose the game. No exceptions. \nBasically, if you like the general shtick of this sort of tactical puzzle fighting (somewhat reminiscient of Fire Emblem/OB: Knight of Lodis/Advance Wars) then you'll probably enjoy this. If you haven't tried it, I'd recommend it. \n\nCustomisation and Replayability\nThere's a roster of pilots you can choose from. They have some vey rudimentary personalities that will influence what they say at key moments and they each have a special ability. Some abilities cost additional power, which is often scarce but they might give a mech \"flying\" so it's not effected by terrain or give it armour to reduce damage. Others might increase movement range or exp gain. \nIn additon to changing the pilot, there's a range of mechs you can choose from which come in pre-made teams but which can be mixed and matched as you gain more. You gain more mechs by unlocking achievements, which can be a little tedious for certain mech teams (looking at you Steel Judoka).\nEach mech team has a theme and some are actually really fun -such as the fire-based mechs which are immune to fire and all have abilities that set things on fire or the Hazardous Mechs which all do good damage but damage themselveswith every attack and rely on killing enemies to regen their health.   \nIt's a good thing these mechs and pilots exist, or replayability would be almost completely absent. As it is, it's more of a delaying tactic than a cure. \nIt's a bit like playing games like DoW or old school Command and Conquer where no matter the little changes in each map the premise does become pretty stale pretty quickly. \nI'm not sure if Subset plans to support this game after release, but I hope they do. I'd like to see a \"mech building\" DLC at the least. \nYou also get badges for beating the game after two, three or four islands with each pre-made team. This doesn't really seem like an achievment to me since once you've beaten the game with a team it's pretty much enough (and the final battle scales with your level, so it isn't really that much harder).\n\nPlot\nPretty much completely absent. The worldbuilding is a lot weaker than FTL, or most other tactics games actually, where you got the feeling you were were travelling across a galaxy. \n\n  \nInevitable FTL Comparisons. \nIt's probably not fair to compare this game (or many others) to FTL. One is an entirely serviceable little game, the other is a fan-favourite that single handedly brought the Roguelike back into style. I've not played an indie game on FTL's level since and that includes this title. \nIf you're looking for something to scratch the FTL itch, this is unfortunately not it. The game is shorter, more prone to RNG and less developed. FTL managed to compactly worldbuild whilst never getting boring and had a heap of depth and secrets. \nAs far as you can compare them, FTL is still lightyears ahead. \n\nOther Stuff\n\nI don't know. This game just...feels...a little incomplete to me. Like when I beat it I was like \"that's it?\" I expected there'd be more. \n\n\nIn Closing\n\nIt's not a bad game, I recommend it. I'd recommend it even more if it's on sale. It's worth a play, but don't expect it to match up to FTL and you'll be reasonably well pleased. Know that it's short and doesn't have a lot of depth and you weren't be disappointed. \n", "timestamp_created": 1520139807, "timestamp_updated": 1520139807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

I played it for about 2 hours, finished it, and feel like I'm done with it.\n\nIf I decide to play it more and change my mind, I will revisit this review.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n\nThe best part about this turn-based strategy game is the mechanic where you able to move enemies during your turn, making their attacks land on different locations than they intended. That's the gimmick of this game. There are also other things you can do, like launching artillery at an enemy on a sand tile to turn the sand into \"smoke\" which stops their attack. You can also get enemies to hit each other-- this wouldn't be possible to plan if the game did not have its Move Order menu where you can see the order in which enemies will attack. It doesn't tell you the order of anything else though, like movement or burrowing or environmental effects. You have to work that out as you play. \n\nIn my time playing, I never saw a method to make enemies *rotate* their stance, which would have been really interesting. Only methods to translate (move) enemies one tile at a time. \n\nEnemies frequently burrow in (are introduced into the battle) turn after turn, and their movements were unpredictable to me. Because of this, I could only take moves one turn at a time. I never planned a single move ahead, apart from maybe 3 exceptions where I had a vague idea of where I wanted my unit to be next turn. In a way, I really enjoy this because I can take my time with each move, and not stress too much about what will happen next. That aspect of the game is very enjoyable. But I'm sure many will see this as a fault. After all, I did win on my first time playing (on Normal, not Easy) without ever planning ahead...\n\n[h1]A few problems with the game:[/h1]\n\n[list]\n\n[*][b]Previous runs impact your future runs.[/b] First of all in the form of unlocks, which I feel are pointless gates that exist to stop the player doing well or experiencing variety until they've played long enough. The more annoying thing is that when you finish a run, you're allowed to take one of your pilots (playable characters; presumably fully leveled up from the completed run) to your next run. Uuhh... why are you allowed to give yourself a handicap on your next run if you did well on your previous one? It just makes you feel like you're at a disadvantage if you DON'T have a previous pilot to take with you. I do not understand why creators  of Rogue-like feel the urge to do this. The victory itself is the reward, not the ability to give yourself a handicap next run; that isn't satisfying at all!\n\n[*][b]The game doesn't tell you the consequences of death.[/b] I deliberately killed a mech to gain extra experience right at the end of a battle (using self-destruct), because the tutorial told me that mechs would repair themselves after battle. But it neglected to mention that your human pilot inside will die and you will lose bonuses. Thanks, tutorial!\n\n[*][b]Consequences for death are inconsistent.[/b]In the final battle, there is a second phase. Your mechs are restored to full health, except pilots are not resurrected if they died, and the mechs will be stripped of any additional weapons (and presumably powers) that they had. Once again, would have been great if the game told me there was a second phase, and that death had a large penalty. Then I could have planned accordingly. But nope no mention of that, just trial and error. Not to mention that this is inconsistent with how death normally operates, where the mechs keep their weapons/bonuses. So this is just unique to that battle I guess. Maybe it's a bug/oversight.\n\n[*][b]There weren't enough \"mech cores\" to upgrade my units much[/b]. I equipped a second weapon on each of my mechs, and that was just about all I could afford. The game gives the appearance of there being more upgrades available, but I doubt if you could actually afford many of those. To be fair, I only completed the first 2 islands of 4. Perhaps the 3rd and 4th islands have significantly more mech cores to find; I don't know.\n\n[*][b]Missions are generic permutations of the same ruleset.[/b] There are four kinds of objectives: (a) Take less than X damage (b) Kill X enemies (c) Protect this special building (d) Kill this particular enemy. The environmental hazards are a great breath of fresh air.\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Variety dried up[/h1]\n\nNow that I've completed the game, (on my first run, and on Normal) I feel no desire to play again. I know the content; I will be repeating the same battles with the same objectives permuted around. Maybe I'll get a different weapon here or there. I can't choose different mechs because that's behind a pointless unlock wall. Like FTL, the unlock walls are completely arbitrary objectives which you must go out of your way to complete, sacrificing the actual mission. For example, one involves dunking 3 land enemies into water within one battle. I didn't do this because it was never strategically viable. If I want to unlock stuff, I have to waste time by making a game with no intention of winning, just completing the arbitrary objectives.", "timestamp_created": 1520133736, "timestamp_updated": 1520133736, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.401051", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40551736": {"recommendationid": "40551736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004531100", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 527, "last_played": 1520712077}, "language": "english", "review": "For fans of turn-based-strategy games and rad as hell mechs.\n\nIt recreates those season finale episode moments of shows like Gundam, Evangelion or Starship Troopers (there is a show) where you arrive at the last possible second as the space bugs are arriving to attack one of the last surviving human settlements.\nIt is up to you to figure out the best way to keep casualties low and when to jump in front of a bullet.\nYou'll also be sweating bullets since it very often feels like you're outnumbered until you figure out the best way to position your mechs and the enemy.\n\nThis is very much like Chess if you could move your opponents pieces with your attacks.\nIf you are patient and read all the information the game gives to you (of which there is quite a bit) you are sure to find the best way forward.\nDon't be afraid of trying it on Easy to unlock more mechs which might be better suited for you, since they play quite differently.\n\nIt is a game about managing loss and learning to accept failure.\nFew victories (in Normal mode) are not snatched from the jaws of total defeat.\n\nWhile it is indeed punishing it's not unfair.

(Think Star Trek vs Star Wars on steroids.)    \n\nFinal Score for \"Into the Breach\",  AKA ,\"Pacific Rift Walkers\", AKA \"Macross Bugs\", AKA \"Quad Mech Seed\"  :)\n\n+ deep strategy\n+ fun and intense\n+ quick, aggressive, passionate moments with regret (just like my lovemaking)\n+ buildings seem alive thanks to speech bubbles\n+ Quad Artillery mech\n+ Tanks\n+ Aerial Strikes\n+ Physical attacks\n+ Upgradable mechs and new units\n+ Rep points\n+ Time Travel\n+ multiple attack strategys\n+ no multiplayer (hence no region lock required :)\n+ Free copy of Faster them Light\n\n- generic mech designs\n- no multiplayer\n\n\n5 stars - Stop reading this, buy and play now.    \n\nVek-cellent!\n\nI mean Mech-cellent!\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1520129063, "timestamp_updated": 1520129063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40550522": {"recommendationid": "40550522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164077133", "num_games_owned": 448, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 110, "last_played": 1521569191}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u304c\u5c0f\u3055\u304f1\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u306e\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3\u6570\u3082\u5c11\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u88ab\u5bb3\u3092\u6700\u5c0f\u9650\u306b\u6291\u3048\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u601d\u8003\u3092\u5de1\u3089\u3059\u5fc5\u8981\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u6226\u7565\u7684\u306a\u5965\u6df1\u3055\u306f\u7533\u3057\u5206\u306a\u3044\u3002\n\u5e02\u8857\u306e\u8fd1\u508d\u3067\u6575\u3092\u6483\u7834\u3059\u308b\u3068\u6b53\u58f0\u304c\u4e0a\u304c\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3068\u3044\u3063\u305f\u7c8b\u306a\u6f14\u51fa\u3082\u3042\u3063\u3066\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3059\u308b\u306e\u304c\u697d\u3057\u3044\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1520128504, "timestamp_updated": 1520128504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40550334": {"recommendationid": "40550334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074576652", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 224, "last_played": 1520746490}, "language": "english", "review": "I <3 FTL.

Beau petit rogue-like Tactique, si vous aimez les combats dans le style de XCOM vous allez probablement appr\u00e9cier ce jeu. Il souffre quand m\u00eame de b\u00e9mols non n\u00e9gligeables nottament un manque de contenu brut et a un aspect trop g\u00e9n\u00e9rique \u00e0 mon go\u00fbt.\n\nLes points forts\n\nLes combats sont extr\u00eament bien fignol\u00e9s et repr\u00e9sentent tout l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du jeu. Contrairement \u00e0 plusieurs jeux similaires o\u00f9 le but de chaque missions/combats consiste \u00e0 \u00e9liminer ses adversaires, ici on cherche \u00e0 survivre pendant un nombre fixe de tour tout en d\u00e9fendant la population locale. On passe donc beaucoup moins de temps \u00e0 tenter de r\u00e9duire la barre de vie des bestioles mais surtout \u00e0 les bouger afin qu'il n'endommagent pas les objectifs cl\u00e9s.  Le tout donne \u00e0 chaque mission beaucoup plus le sentiment d'\u00eatre un mini puzzle tr\u00e8s gratifiant pl\u00fbtot que d'\u00eatre une sorte de lanc\u00e9 de d\u00e9 avec une pri\u00e8re au bon dieu. Il y a quand m\u00eame une part d'al\u00e9atoire et une fois de temps en temps il y aura des situations sans autres options que de laisser un b\u00e2timent ce faire d\u00e9truire ou de devoir abandonner un des objectifs secondaires.\n\nSans \u00eatre n\u00e9cessairement exceptionnelles, les graphismes, la bande sonores et les animations font du beau boulot et rendent le tout tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able. Bref, pas grand chose \u00e0 dire dessus.\n\nLes point faibles\n\nLe jeu est, pour un rogue-like, assez maigre en terme de contenu. J'ai, je crois, 16 heures au total pr\u00e9sentement et j'ai vraiment le sentiment d'avoir fait le tour m\u00eame s'il reste des achievements ici et l\u00e0 \u00e0 faire.

I never felt like I was getting more powerful, or any sence of accomplishment, because the more powerful I got, the more powerful the monsters got identically.  I never felt any need or desire to take risks to get more powerful weapons or more energy, because, the monsters would simply mirror what I acheived.  In the end I did not really care.\n\nThere is also almost no sence of exploration or surpise in ITB.

The short length allows for experimentation and iteration. Easier unlocks elementates the grinding that was at times necessary in FTL. Clearly telegraphed moves by the Vek (the monsters in this game) make for a very thoughtful, tactical game. Especially once you realized you positioned your mecs wrong the previous turn and there's no way you can get them to where they need to be to complete the mission/prevent loss of grid power (your \"life\"). Keeping a time travelling pilot between playthroughs also gives a consistent narrative to the game. \n\nIs Into the Breach FTL?

You position yourself around an enemy and punch them with numbers, then grind to get better numbers. The movement and the positioning is important, but it comes second to the offensive intention.\n\nInto the Peach switches that around. Position is vital because your HP is fragmented into various squares that need guarded above all else. Numbers are useful, but a victory can be had without any damage at all if that's the style of your team.\n\nA lot of very clever decisions have helped reinforce the feeling that you are playing a defensive game, rather than an offensive one. And this is important in a Giant Mech game. Many others focus so heavily on killing the enemy that the surrounding environment can be completely destroyed all in the name of \"protecting\" it. Here, you truly protect the cities.\n\nIt's not without its faults. The ending comes too soon and too often. And after a few playthroughs you'll feel like you've seen most of what the game has to offer; there won't be many new surprises along the way, which is a shame. But it's well worth the money.\n\nI'd recommend this game in general if you like tactics gaming to show you a new way of play.

The first night I got it, i found myself saying, one more turn, one more turn. Its simple on the outside looking in, but once you're actually in the game, all the different senarios and events the game throws at you makes it that much more complex. the game works on a grid, turn based system, where the monsters show you what they are about to do, and its your job to keep them from destroying the city. If you fail, you start over, aka go back in time, and you get to keep one of your characters with all the xp and skills they had previously, so it makes it so that you might go the extra mile to protect a pilot you really enjoy, at risk of failing a mission.

It is a simple turn based strategy game with a few basic rules, and to be sucessful you just use and exploit these rules to the fullest potential. The game is most rewarding to the patient player who takes their time to plan out many different possible moves during a turn before settling on one, and this is the main aspect of the game that I found very entertaining. Each level becomes a puzzle, and there is almost always a solution that can be found without that would give you the best possible outcome, unless you're playing on hard, where often times I had to settle for sub-optimal solutions due to the sheer number of enemies thrown at me.\n\nWhile the core gameplay is fun for a while, the biggest issue I have with the game right now is its lack of deapth and replayability. There are 11 different mech squads for you to unlock (10 standard and 1 hidden and play as in the game, but for the most part I felt very little urge to play each squad more than once because repeated runs using the same squad always began to feel samey after one or two runs. Most of the gameplay and strategic variety came from which squad you started with, and not from the upgrades you choose or unlock during the game. Often times I found myself beating the end level with the same loadout I had started with in the beginning, and to me, that's a huge problem because subsequent runs become very boring. \n\nComparing the progression of this game to FTL really highights this issue. Runs in FTL are almost ALWAYS unique and interesting, you almost never end with a ship that remotely resembles the ship that you had at the beginning, unlike in Into the Breach. Your path choices in FTL also feel like they had so much more of a risk/reward tradeoff than decisions in Into the Breach. In this respect FTL is a much better example of an in deapth rogue like game. Even at 50+ hours into FTL there are still many different things I have yet to discover and several ships I have yet to unlock, whereas in Into the Breach, I'd already unlocked and played all 10 base squads at only 15 hours, and at this point I really don't feel like this game has much more to offer in terms of entertaining gameplay.\n\nOverall, I am happy with a game if I can get $1/hour of gameplay, and while this game 100% hits that mark, I still feel like something was missing. Much of that sense of dissatisfaction comes from the fact that I had expected so much more from Into The Breach since it was made by the same people who gave me the hours of entertainment from FTL. But I digress, buy this game, play it untill you unlock each squad, then go and play FTL for a million hours because its a freaking amazing game.", "timestamp_created": 1520098049, "timestamp_updated": 1520098049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40540408": {"recommendationid": "40540408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005676424", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2446, "last_played": 1521736108}, "language": "russian", "review": "This game  neeeds PvP mode, like in Left for dead, where second player controls VEK.

One could argue what it 'means' to actually finish this devs games. Is it a playthrough? Is it unlocking everything? Is it climbing the himalayas and finding yourself?\n\nKeep an eye on Subset Games, they are living, breathing examples of how indie devs are the true game-creators of our time. They made a succesfull game and created not a sequel, prequel or spiritual succesor, but a completeley new game within another genre and retained all the strenghts of it's predecessor and polished some of the frustrating elements. \n\nWhile both FTL and Into the Breach has that juicy Roguelike DNA, Breach is far more reliant on your skills, and rewards you for it. The game centers around anticipating your opponents movements and acting accordingly. Much like in FTL, you have a vast array of components to your 'pieces' you can upgrade to change the game, and you will find yourself thinking up new strategies just by seeing what upgrades you can start working towards.\n\nI never say games are perfect 10/10 but the 9 whispers to me sweet temptations.", "timestamp_created": 1520095498, "timestamp_updated": 1520095498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40539246": {"recommendationid": "40539246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016597697", "num_games_owned": 951, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 103, "last_played": 1520601154}, "language": "russian", "review": "\"\u0415\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043e\u043d\" \u043e\u0442 \u041a\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0430 \u0410\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0441 \u0434\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c\u0438, \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0431\u043e\u044f\u043c\u0438, \u0440\u0435\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e FTL, \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0438 95%-\u043f\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438.\n\n\u041f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0432\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 - \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u044e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0439\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u0443\u043c\u044b \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430.", "timestamp_created": 1520095024, "timestamp_updated": 1520095270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668631", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40539239": {"recommendationid": "40539239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097537199", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 301, "last_played": 1521138008}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome game!  they should put it out on switch too", "timestamp_created": 1520095005, "timestamp_updated": 1520095005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40538918": {"recommendationid": "40538918", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998976089", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 667, "last_played": 1521493028}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0421\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440 \u0440\u0435\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f , \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u044f\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433 , \u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u044c\u044e\u0442\u0435\u0440, \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0441 \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u0443\u0436\u0435 FTL \u0441\u043c\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 .

I don't love it (yet?) and I've still got a nagging doubt haunting me, that this isn't as good as FTL...\n\nHowever, it is good. It's very pure; the story and world building is sparse, just enough to colour the proceedings with some sci fi flavour. I feel the influence of movies like [i]Edge of Tomorrow[/i] and [i]Pacific Rim[/i] at work. I would have preferred a lot more in this direction; more story, more dialogue, more flavour, more to connect me to the world and characters and really make me care more about the lives at stake. Compared with FTL, there's very little text. On the other hand, the game is never bogged down with bloated writing, cutscenes, or other flim flam.\n\nThe game is quite chess like, in that you have a grid to play on, and you have pieces with limited and individual movesets. The board is more dynamic than chess, with every piece moving and attacking every turn, and each turn you have to survey the board to find threats, and use your limited forces to best defeat those threats. It's quite like a puzzle game.\n\nITB relies on throwing many simple moving parts together to arrive at a certain level of complexity. However, at some point you'll have seen every interesting and surprising combination of mech/enemies/weapon/pilots/powers.\n\nThere are four islands to fight over with unique terrain and features, and they are cool, but I feel like four is way too few. I feel like this aspect of the game is crying out for expansion. I'd like more variety here, and I'd also like the option of longer campaigns (the option to play very short campaigns is welcome). I'd also like there to be a bit more in terms of mech upgrades and pilot experience levels. Enemies get samey, as there's a very limited pool of different types. There's a fair few things that feel underdeveloped in ITB, and I hope Subset are planning some fairly major updates to the game, perhaps as a DLC on par with the one FTL got. \n\nIn summary, it's good fun, I think it's worth the tenner, I'm sure I'm going to get a decent amount of play out of it, but I'm pretty sure that this is in no way a work of genius in the same league as FTL.There just isn't the same level of depth and expansiveness, there's not enough dramatic surprises, not enough excitment.

The replayability is high, thanks to lots of unlocks of each squad. This is where the game shines, you can unlock squads which are teams of 3 different units, each of which makes you approach the game in a different style because of their abilities. Some reviews state that the game has more transpiracy than FTL when it comes to mechanics which I think is true to a degree; some enemies have passive abilities, which lack a detailed discription and their effects are more of a surprise when you experience them for the first time. \nThe game is too hard especially on normal difficulty and the graphics are poor- some might say artistic but it's more like Ellsworth Kelly's square modern art, very basic with a lack of creativity.\nOverall I'd recommend buying the game during sale or if you don't already own FTL and want both games, since you get a copy of it for free.\n\nEdit: The game got way too repetitive.

I loved FTL - and I really wanted to like this - but it's disappointing. FTL was unique and compelling on many levels; best defined as a rogue-like, but really, it was its own entity. Into the Breach is really just a turn-based board game, dressed up as a video game. You could play your own version with a4 paper and tiddlywinks - seriously. \n\nFTL had a feel-good factor; an easily understandable (if well tried) scenario, bright, clean graphics and colours, all primaries, secondaries, blacks and whites. All this, accompanied by a perfectly complimentary, catchy, and non-annoying soundtrack. The whole thing had a lightness of touch, and felt good to play. \n\nInto the Breach, by contrast, is a wholly more acquired taste. The time travel theme of the story seems to have been contrived to fit the gameplay (predicting the enemy's moves), and the mechs and kaijus thing is all a bit more niche than FTL's familiar Star Trekking, or Blake's 7ing. The colour scheme is completely tertiary - everything is a shade of green, brown, or grey, and all the action seems to take place in a surreal twilight. Ben Prunty's soundtrack is noteworthy - dark and brooding - but contributes, along with everything else, to make Into the Breach more cognitively and sensorily dissonant than FTL. \n\nFTL's success, I'm convinced, was as much to do with its clean audio and visual aesthetic as it was to do with the brilliant gameplay. If FTL flerted with pixel art, ITB declares its undying adoration for the look and feel of late 80s/early 90s video games, and throws itself prostrate and earnest at their feet. It just isn't cool. \n\nIn fairness, it's polished, and the mechanisms in the game have had a lot of thought. For some reason I can't explain, I just don't want to play it longer than the few hours I already have. I think it might be boring, but I can't be bothered playing it for longer to find out - it just doesn't grab me like FTL did. \n\nUnfair comparison?

Minimalistisch, herausfordernd, Von erhabenen, genialen Momenten \u00fcberlegener Strategie bis zu den Tiefen der totalen Vernatzung sind es oft nur wenige Minuten...\n\nSehr einfach gehalten, was die Kampfmechaniken angeht 0 % Zufall. Man wei\u00df zu jedem Zeitpunkt genau was passieren wird. Fr\u00fch wird man sich davon verabschieden es \"perfekt\" hinzubkommen, also nie Schaden zu nehmen, nie einen Mech zu verlieren, einmal ein Objective nicht schaffen. Aber genau das macht das Spiel ja aus, man \"snowballed\" sich da nicht einfach durch, jede Entscheidung, ob auf der ersten oder auf der letzten Karte entscheidet \u00fcber Erfolg oder Misserfolg. \n\nWem es mit der \"Default-Squat\" zu schwer ist, der darf sich auf 9 weitere Herausforderungen freuen. OB ich den \"Random-Mode\" mag, wage ich zu bezweifeln und auch der \"Custom Mode\" wird wohl eher zu OP-Squats f\u00fchren als zur wahren Spielfreude, aber vorerst wird mich das Spiele viele STunden besch\u00e4fiten. Auch ein Speedrun(Versuch) in der Mittagspause...\n\nJa, der \"Spawn\" der Kreaturen scheint zuf\u00e4llig . Zumindest konnte ich noch keine Vorhersehbarkeit der Spawns ausmachen, so dass man beispielsweise durch Blocken bestimmte Gegner verhindert k\u00f6nnte. Dieser \"zufall\" l\u00e4sst einen manchnal verzweifeln, aber wenn's komplett gescrpited w\u00e4re, w\u00e4re es wohl auch Mist. Vielleicht k\u00f6nnte es ja eine \"Passiv-F\u00e4higkeit\" geben, die den Spawn erkennt, um vor allem in Hardmode noch besser planen zu k\u00f6nnen. \n\nIch bin sicher, dass dieses Spiele 1000ende STunde Spielspa\u00df f\u00fcr jeden Hobbystrategen bietet.

To put it bluntly, the game is incredibly short and easy. I put 200 hours into FTL and I could go back for another run even now. But after one sitting of Into The Breach, I had already seen the majority of the content. There's 4 small islands with a few missions each, then a surprisingly easy boss fight with very little replay value. Outside of unlocking all the mechs and trying some combinations of mechs, there isn't much to do. \n\n[b]Lack of Replayability[/b]\nThe first few hours of this game were a blast. It was fun to figure things out, and it was very rewarding to win fights in clever ways. However in less than 8 hours you will have virtually seen every aspect of this game. You'll have seen nearly every gameplay mechanic, seen most of the weapons and enemies, and unlocked most of mechs and pilots. Beyond that is just grinding for achievements and the remaining unlockables, which would be fine except that ITB has almost no replay value. There are only a few different types of missions, nearly all of which you will encounter in a couple playthroughs. \n\nThe final fight is not only incredibly stale (there's not even a unique enemy type or boss there), it's incredibly easy as well. It's also scaled so that if you do it early, it'll be significantly simpler, so you're not required to complete all 4 islands before going there. Even if you're not great at these kinds of tactics games, you could easily \"beat the game\" in under an hour on your first play-through by going to the final fight after completing 2 of the 4 islands.\n\n[b]Lack of Customization Depth[/b]\nYou begin the game with a squad of 3 mechs, they come in themed groups of 3 but you can mix-and-match and make a custom squad as you unlock more to choose from. Each mech can be equipped with a second weapon, and that's basically it. As you play you'll find reactors to upgrade your mechs HP and Movement (once each), and maybe a couple of weapon upgrades too (like +1 damage or +1 range). By the time you're ready for the final fight you won't feel like you had much a choice in upgrading your mech other than the order in which you did it.\n\nYou start with 1 unique pilot that has a signature ability like \"Can move through other units\" or \"Has Armor\", and 2 generic pilots with no ability. As you level the each pilot up, they will get 2 randomized skills (out of a pool of 4 possible skills) and cannot be customized at all. Just pray to god your pilot doesn't get \"+3 Grid Defense\" as one of his skills instead of something that's actually useful. You can find more unique pilots as you play, replacing the generic ones. If you lose the game, you can keep 1 pilot for your next play through, and he keeps his skills.\n\nOverall the game severely lacks variety and depth, that's really all there is to it. I can see myself coming back to this game if they ever add an expansion or big content patch to the game, or perhaps if the modding community really takes off, but I was definitely disappointed with how short the game was.

It looked like this game would offer a procedurally generated series of tightly-focused, small-scale puzzles that I would then have to solve using a modestly varied set of tools with a pre-determined, RNGless set of capabilities. Once the pieces were in place, I hoped, I could then plan how a turn would play out to the last exact detail.\n\nTurns out? That's EXACTLY what I got, and I highly recommend this game IF that sounds appealing to you. On the other hand, DO NOT buy this game if you want another FTL. If you want that, play the Captain's Edition mod for FTL instead, if you haven't already (if you have, try A Strange New Galaxy or Stations Job, which offer unique appeals of their own even though they're not as polished or feature-complete as CE).\n\nAs far as roguelites go, Into the Breach is fairly light on equipment and enemy variety (variance in general really) and on fleshing out the setting, but is VERY similar to Invisible Inc. in that respect. The two games are almost part-and-parcel in that they are both immensely satisfying little brain teasers where the fun and challenge of the game is in racking your brain for the optimal solution to the situation each turn presents, then feeling so very accomplished indeed when you discover and execute a series of moves that leaves the enemy floundering helplessly, doing no damage to either you or your buildings (or in Invisible Inc.'s case, the guards running around like headless chickens with no idea where your agents are).\n\nBeyond that, Into the Breach has a simple but stylish aesthetic, simple but stylish music courtesy of FTL's composer Ben Prunty, and is generally simple and stylish all the way around. It's a very clean, almost clinical sort of game, but that is, I feel, as it should be for a game of its type, another quality it shares with Invisible Inc. It shows you exactly what you need to know to plan your next move and nothing more, leaving your thinking space free of distractions.\n\nAgain, the satisfaction of this game is the intellectual satisfaction of a well-executed plan. If you're looking for the visceral satisfaction of giant robots punching giant bugs, you won't really find that here as the combat animations and sound effects are fairly minimalist (though pushing the monsters into water or chasms never stops being funny). If, on the other hand, you're down for a well-realized puzzle game with a fascinating rule set and a helping of giant robotics on the side, you'd be mad not to check out Into the Breach.\n\nThen check out Invisible Inc. once you're done.

Different from FTL, this is Its a turn based game, like Final Fantasy Tactics or Advance Wars.\n\nThe game:\nThe game is pretty simple. You select a squad of 3 mechs and try to save the earth. Each squad of mechs has its own unique theme and you have to adapt your playstyle in order to make it work. For example there is a squad that focuses on burning enemies and the terrain while your mechs are inmune to fire damage, or there is the Judoka squad that focuses on re-positioning your enemies with pushing/tossing moves in order to make them attack themselves.\nIn order to beat the game you have to fight in 4 different islands with different kind of terrains and enviromental hassards, and once completing them you can go to the \"last stand\" fight and try to beat the game. The game allows you to fight the last stand with only 2/4 islands complete if you are up for the challenge.\n\n\nUnlocking squads:\nEvery time you complete the game with a squad you earn coins that are used to unlock new squads (any of them). Completing challenges also grant coins for new squads. Different from FTL, there is no locked path to unlock stuff. In FTL you needed to do challenges with ship A to unlock ship B, and after that you do challenges with ship B to unlock ship C and so on. In Into The Break you can unlock whatever squad you want as long as you have coins.\nYou can also play with your own custom squad! Make your dream team squad with the mechs you have unlocked and try new strategies. There is also the option to play with a random generated squad. Both options have their own challenges as well to earn some extra coins.\n\nPilots:\nWhen you start a game you can choose a Pilot for one of your squad mechs. Pilots have skills that can alter A LOT how you play a mech. There a pilots that make your mechs tougher, others allow extra movement options (like flying) and many other great passive skills.\n\nConclusion:\nThe game is great, but its full of bugs (pun intended). If you want to play a great tactical game, you cant be wrong with this one. The amount of replayability is insane and you can easly tell that the game was made with a lot of passion. Great price, great devs and a great game.\n\nPS; you get a free copy of Faster Than Light (FTL) with the purchase of this game!!!! If you already got that game you get an extra copy for you to gift it to your friends.

That was on normal difficulty with the starting mech squad. Then I changed the difficulty to hard, unlocked a couple more squads, and suddenly the game completely changed. Now it's easily one of my favorite indie games on Steam.\n\nThis is because the starting squad is a bit plain and predictable - aim the artillery, line up the cannons, and march your heavy in for a solid hit. It's a good way to become familiar with the game mechanics. But the game opens up once you leave that squad behind. The other squads all have entirely different play styles that require you to completely rethink your strategy and how you approach the game. What worked for one squad won't even get you past the first stage with another. There are squads with self-destructive attacks you have to arrange carefully, squads that light the field on fire and require you to manipulate enemies into gradual damage, squads that have a single heavy hitting mech and two others that exist solely to move enemies into position for devastating chain hits. I spent hours learning the quirks and strategies of one squad to finally beat the game on hard, then I switched to the new one I unlocked and got my ass handed to me anew. Each squad feels like a different take on the game, and the replay value resulting from that is fantastic.\n\nI enjoy difficult games that make you work for victories, and on normal difficulty it took a couple tries before it seemed a bit too easy. But on hard the difficulty ramps up to perfection - extremely challenging moments have you staring at the screen for ten minutes plotting your next move and running thorugh every scenario in your head. It's been very common for me to be faced with a setting that seems like there's simply no way to come out alive, then suddenly a eureka moment where I see a long chain of events that could potentially lead to a narrow victory. These kinds of moments remove the frustration from the game and make you think that if you feel stuck, you aren't - you just haven't seen the solution yet. The music has a great feel of determination to it that perfectly suits those moments when suddenly you realize you may have found your way out.\n\nThere is a huge amount of strategy packed into the tiny maps in this game, and a considerable amount of content that far exceeds it's extremely reasonable price tag.

Most deaths come through one tough battle that you just aren't good enough/well equipped enough to handle yet instead of multiple hits over the course of the game that just eventually added up. However, in ITB that's exactly the case - the game will sometimes throw out a turn where you get 4 enemies all trying to hit the buildings, and you get three mechs. If the enemies are spread apart there's virtually nothing you can do to stop them, since you only attack once per turn and usually can only attack one enemy at a time.\n\n-The 'move' ranges seem a bit random and weird, I'd like to be able to see how my mech's move range changes if they get pushed back a tile or something like that because you can't reverse attacks.", "timestamp_created": 1520052574, "timestamp_updated": 1520052574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40525673": {"recommendationid": "40525673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122803792", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1726, "last_played": 1521694462}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely fun", "timestamp_created": 1520051643, "timestamp_updated": 1520051643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40525608": {"recommendationid": "40525608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119619513", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1991, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 236, "last_played": 1521517309}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm... on the fence about Into the Breach.\n \nI spent just about 4 nigths in a row playing this game: totally immersed in the rewarding loop of enemy manipulation, mech positioning, and achievment hunting. I had dreams of punching aliens into one another. \nBut then, after 20 hours, I hit a wall. I hit a point where I realized that I had seen everything the game had to offer. I wasn't 20 hours in, and I realized that I felt I knew every enemy and mechanic in the game. FTL, even after the 40 or so hours I've poured in, hasn't made me feel this way. In the 40 hours of time spent in FTL, I had never felt like I had seen everything; more like I had just seen a lot and there was more on the horizon. Into the Breach doesn't make me feel this way. And though that's a sad thing to say, the one feeling that into the breach has inspired in me is the feeling that I was always at fault. In FTL I've been bombarded by swarm missile 2 beacons in, boarded by mantis in the middle of a zoltan sector, and burnt to a crisp by suns 10 seconds into a jump; but in Into the Breach I've always felt that a mistake I made was one or two turn in the making: Every failure was brought on by me.

(and of course rogue-like game-over's) It's also pretty difficult, which is both good, and bad.

Yes, it's made by the same devs. Yes, it's visually somewhat similar (especially the UI). And yes, it also is a quality product. But the gameplay is completely different. Which is a great thing. We already have FTL which is a masterpiece, so why repeat it when you can make something new?\n\nThis game is challenging, but never once have I felt that it was unfair. Their can be tiny bit of luck involved in your initial unit placement and enemy spawns, but other than that I don't think that I've blamed the game much (if at all) for my losses. I always felt responsible for the moves I've been making, and it's great. That is exactly what a strategy should feel like.\n\nI absolutely love the setting of this game. \"Edge of Tomorrow\", \"Pacific Rim\" and a bit of \"Gundam\" mixed together. Which gives us a variety of nicely designed weaponry to play with.\n\nMusic is limited, but however little there is - it's very pleasant. Feels like a bit of a mash-up of \"Borderlands\" and \"Gravity Falls\" soundtracks to me.\n\nThis is the first game in a long time where I felt like achievements weren't a chore, but instead a nice little extra challenge. Some of them are tied to your squads and help you learn its mechanics in a fun way. And then for doing it you unlock other squads.\n\nIf there is one issue I have with this game - it's its replayability.\nSo, you have your achievements, you have new unlockable squads and you can create your own made of the units you've unlocked. You have different pilots with different passive abilities as well. All of this is cool. However, the map and mission variety is extremely limited. You'll start noticing the same maps no further than your second run. And mission types - even sooner. It didn't stop me from enjoying the game so far, but I can see how it can be detrimental for long-term enjoyment.\n\nThat said, this game is still an easy recomendation for anyone who loves themselves a bit of tactics or is interested in the setting.

You are given a squad of three mechs and face off against waves of enemies. You can kill the enemies by attacking them, pushing them off cliffs or into liquids, or by having them attack eachother. Rounds end after a set number of turns, so routing the enemies isn't required. Enemy attacks are shown at the start of your turn so you can anticipate and turn them against eachother.\n\nIt's a fun formula, and it's made difficult through cities that you must defend, each hit to city takes away from your global health and if it reaches 0 it's game over. There are a couple of ways to restore that health, some missions offer it as a reward, and at the end of an island you have the option of spending earned renown on more health.\n\nThe game is divided between different islands that are similar to the sectors in FTL, there are 4 in all and once they have all been unlocked they can be tackled in any order. After completing 2 islands you can choose to do the final mission rather than do the remaining islands. \n\nEach island has its own theme and mission types that appear. The desert island tends to have missions that involve killing a set number of enemies compared to an ice island where you have to protect/destroy robots that act on their own. The variety between the islands is nice, but 4 islands feels like far too few, after a couple of playthroughs the missions start to get a little repetitive. \n\nSince Into the Breach suffers from a lack of content in regards to scenarios, the replay value comes from trying out different squads. Unfortunately, playing the game a second time with the same squad isn't as appealing as trying again with the same ship in FTL, as the mech's starting kit is generally worth using for the duration of the game.\n\nSo in its current state, I do recommend Into the Breach at its modest price of $15, I think it could easily provide 10-20 hours of entertainment and if additional islands are added even more.

But the fact that it was the same dude after 2-3 wipes, I felt connected to him. I was introduced to him as I first booted up the game and now he's gone forever. I can't go back in time to get him back.\n\nHe left me with this simple message, \"remember what I taught you\"... there's something existential about a time traveler that dies and never comes back. They also reference the idea of \"time lines\" which begs the question of what they mean when they use that term. Am I the propogater of hell? Am I hap-hazardly destroying entire world's futures as a result of me not fully understanding the game as of yet? Am I the author of negligent destruction?\n\nAnd if this reality is truly the only one, what does that mean for the time traveler? If he dies and something goes back in time, and presumes without the presence of traveler- does that mean he just disappeared at the very point of returning to that place in time? Since you can't simply allow one of your characters to go back in time and retrieve someone who has died, I'm assuming they are permanently erased from reality altogether (provided we don't consider the multiple worlds theory as present in this game). \n\nIn this particular game... since characters don't come back even with time travel:\n\n1. Multiple worlds theory is true, which means the death of someone applies to all possible versions of the character as a result = they're 4th dimensional\n\n2. Or... this is the only reality, if time travel is to be treated as a factual phenomenon, the character coming back in time (teleportation withstanding) will appear to us as spontaneously acquiring insight and knowledge of a particular and  potential path of events. However, what happens when someone you control dies?\n\nIs it that the character just suddenly stops existing only after the time loop? Would it appear as if they just vanished into nothingness, all their cells and molucules all simultaneously vanishing from existence? (if that were to happen it would instantaneously create a vacuum in the area of where the body was right when it vanished from existance). Or... did they never exist at all? What would happen if you all of a sudden took away a presence of a molucule in a pre-existing timeline in the 4th or 5th dimension, in other words editing the contents in the entirety of a reality's 'timeline'.

It seemed too simplified at first, only a few moves for each robot, and basic abilities, but there is so much you can do with what you have, and the game board is constantly evolving, with each tile meaning different effects.\n\nIt's a game where you defend your buildings and robots, and knock alien monsters into better positions. You can kill a monster by using abilities that hurt it, or you can knock it into the water, or you can knock it into the zone another monster is attacking. There are so many different combinations of moves you can make, and it always feels like there's one perfect move each turn that prevents any building from getting hit. Each turn is intense, and you have to prepare for future turns. It really does feel like chess with superpowered pieces.\n\nI highly recommend the game. It really is a change from FTL, but it's amazing all the same. There is a lot more strategy and way less RNG influence.\n\nThe music is great, and the graphics are really fun, retro pixel style.

Der Preis ist extrems (!!!!) \u00fcberteuert f\u00fcr das Spiel. \nMir ist schleierhaft warum man keine Hd Optik w\u00e4hlt, die Spielvolumen ist so \u00fcberschaubar, das h\u00f6here Texturen weder Rechner in die Knie zwingen, noch das Volumen sprengen w\u00fcrden. Installiert hat es nur 180MB.  Gut, die Macher haben nat\u00fcrlich die k\u00fcnstlerische Freiheit diese Grafik zu w\u00e4hlen um Nostalgie aufzubauen und Kosten zu sparen. Nur wirkt bei mir weder die billig Optik nostalgisch noch rechtfertig der hohe Preis die Grafik. W\u00e4r das Spielprinzip so genial und neu, k\u00f6nnte man alles verzeihen nur  ist es im Grunde genommen nichts anderes als Schach.   Mit vielen Kombinationsm\u00f6glichkeiten, das ist auch das einzig Positive an dem Game. \nMan k\u00e4mpft sich Rundenweise von Insel zu Insel. Werden zu viele H\u00e4user angeschossen, die man besch\u00fctzen muss, \"verliert\" man und man beginnt das Spiel vom kompletten Anfang. Lediglich einen Helden kann man mitnehmen. Die Helden sind aber einer wie der Andere, mit eher kleineren Unterschieden da sie nur 2 Level aufsteigen k\u00f6nnen.  Dh alle Gegenst\u00e4nde die man sich aufgebaut hat und die anderen Helden gehen verloren. Da die Helden sich eh \u00e4hneln ist es im Grunde egal. \nEs gibt 4 Inseln, eine Bossinsel und das war es auch schon. Hat man es durch stehen einem 3 neue Mechs zur Verf\u00fcgung mit denen man das Game wieder durchspielen kann. Ich hab es kurz mit den neuen Mechs angespielt und hatte danach schon keinen Bock mehr und daf\u00fcr 15\u20ac?

Xcom and Fire emblem creators could learn some game design from you :) Unlocking new mechs offer variety new options in combat and show many new ways to play. The best, in may opinion, is almost no-existing RNG in battles, you always see what will happen, what dmg will be done etc. so you feel like you are in total control and all mistakes are by you. Grid defense is only somehow random element but is not game-changing, rather it give you sometime chance to don't take dmg that you probably alerted calculated.\nWhat i fell laking is, in term of combat,that is Uneven level of difficulty, some mission become very hard some are extremal easy.\nEven though turn combat system is so great i can's say that this games is witout flaws. Presented story and plot are almost non-existing, no choices, not big dialogues, only smal-talk with generic npc and missions briefing. Actually all game outside of combat is laking; modification options for mechs are rather minimalistic, like change weapon/pilot and small upgrades to weapons. Choices of what battle you fight doesn't really matters. I save some trains, tanks, artillery, robots, vek etc. but they seams abstract, and could be just random buildings, because all that have lite meaning. In my opinion, there should be some plot-driven consequences/prizes based of missions that you won, lest say if i protect some npc tanks i could \"summon\" them once in different mission on island or some kind of help in final battle. It can be balanced so it would be meaningless \"one time buff\", jet i just wish something like \"you saved our island so we will help you save the world\" etc.\nAlso game is rather short, and ending seams anticlimatic - some big boss please :P .

You also obtain numerous items and ennhancements for your mechs, changing their move set or stats. In all of the fights you are outnumbered with your 3 mechs. Utilizing their strengths and being aware of their weaknesses is key to success. Every mech has a very unqiue kit, allowing them to turn the odds in their favor. There are various 3-man mech teams known as squads, which you can unlock with coins acquired by completing challenges and various achievements.  During the turn-based mayhem you are able to use the environment itself as a tool of destruction, slamming enemies into walls, pushing them into the water and drowning them, etc.\n\n   Regarding audio, the sound effects are great. You can really feel the abilities connect and the damage being done. As far as the soundtrack goes, it's pretty climatic. Has that tactical-ish sort of mood to it. It's not particularly memorable but while playing, it feels right at home with the games atmosphere.\n\nOverall Into the Breach is a very satisfying and rewarding game, beautiful in it's simplicity yet amazing in execution. This is what video games should strive for!

"playtime_forever": 1464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 63, "last_played": 1521678815}, "language": "english", "review": "Into the Breach is, in short, a well designed concept executed with a very strong soundtrack, solid visuals (notably the interface), and gameplay that rewards both reactionary and preemptive strategy.\n\nFor this game's audio and music, I don't feel the need to elaborate much further than to state the fact that Ben Prunty, the artist responsible for FTL's fantastic soundtrack, also created the soundtrack for Into the Breach. This is another way of saying that it's absolutely fantastic, and fits the game's genre just as well.\n\nFrom a purely visual standpoint, the animations are more on the simplistic side, and the design of everything is fairly simple. I'm sure this game could have had a higher level of attention put towards the graphics, not explicity the style or design itself, but they are still solid and very servicable for a turn based strategy game of this scale. On another design note, the interface itself is very, very clean and easy to read, and mousing over units highlights their actions and their consequences enough that it is impossible to make a mistake due to misinterpreting them.\n\nSpeaking of mistakes, this game has extremely little RNG factored into the core gameplay, which for me is a welcome departure from the experience FTL delivers. Enemies move, before your turn even begins, and then telegraph their attack before you are able to move your own units. This creates gameplay where you use the many different weapons each mecha has to both kill, disable, and manipulate the positioning of enemies to mitigate damage to friendly units and structures. Manipulation of positioning allows one to drown an enemy to end them instantly, force them to block another emerging unit, or even cause friendly fire, the latter having an entire mech squad dedicated to such a gameplay strategy.\n\nThe core gameplay loop of this roguelike, similar to many others, is not very long. Resetting takes almost no time at all, and only leaves you with the experience on one pilot to give you a slight edge, so subsequent runs depend more on personal performance than outside progression. Every mech squadron has a unique gimmick that forces you to approach threats differently, and they all can be used to beat the game. The overworld is seperated into 'Islands', which have one approach a set of missions in a mostly non-fixed order until there are 3 left incomplete, where they do a final mission with a boss-type enemy, and after which they are able recieve and spend their reward for clearing. After new islands are introduced, they can be played in any order, and the game itself can be shorter or longer if one desieres, as the final island is open after one clears 2 islands, which is technically only half of the overworld.\n\nAs far as difficulty is concerned, 'Normal' is easier than the 'Normal' that FTL offered, though it will still prove to be a notable challenge, there is also no visible penalty for playing on an easier difficulty other than a reduction in score. Changing difficulty also only really changes the number of enemies one encounters, so if one is frustrated I would support playing on a lower one to gain a better understanding of this game.\n\nThe biggest miss of Into the Breach, however, is that the game conveys very little story within itself. This is mostly due to the very low amount of dialogue outside of combat, and while there is surely an interesting story within, there is little done to elaborate upon it. The map size also feels a bit limiting, though I suppose with only 3 playable units by default anything larger would become too daunting.\n\nOverall, however, I would strongly support purchasing Into the Breach, as it has more than enough replayability to merit the price tag of $15 USD. If I was forced at gunpoint to give a nondecimal numerical rating for this game, out of 10, it would most likely recieve an 8. Though if they add any content at all, such as was done with FTL, said nummerical rating will spike to a 9 immediately.\n\n(I'm also morbidly curious how this game would play on mobile but please port it to android too)", "timestamp_created": 1520023003, "timestamp_updated": 1520023003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522822", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40518428": {"recommendationid": "40518428", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993678301", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 278, "last_played": 1521120310}, "language": "english", "review": "Did you love FTL? Do you think it's a masterly combination of exploration, combat, and hard decisions; both prioritization throughout your journey and in every choice you make? A true example that sometimes less is more?\n\nDo you remember that one run where you got the perfect gear that catapulted you to the final boss, or do you reminisce about that one run where everything went wrong, but you still prevailed again and again before finally grasping triumph with the shredded remnants of a crewed ship on the verge of defeat?\n\nInto the Breach is none of that.\nNone at all.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the game. Got myself a good pilot, trained him to max level, and started a run with a randomized set of mechs that turned out to be excellent. Went from one island beat to complete 4 island run in a single game. And it was great.\n\nBut that was it. \n\nThere was no exploration element. Sure, there are four islands, but because you're supposed to be able to play them in any order they feel generic and bland, even when they're anything but.\n\nCombat is fun, unique, challenging. And repetitive. Found a strategy that works with your current setup? Good. Now use it for the next 10 missions almost exactly the same way. Found an upgrade? New weapon? Good for you. It's rarely going to replace the standard weapons of your mechs, it's just a new backup option in case the primary weapon isn't ideal. Which is good, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't have the gratification of finding that one piece of gear that you just KNOW is going to change the fate of your run.\n\nAnd decisions? Well to be fair, there's plenty of priority decisions to be made. Do you sacrifice a pilot, or do you run the risk and sacrifice a building? Or the bonus objective? Hard choice. Unless you're having a good run, in which case you can buff up your grid to the point where it hardly even matters if buildings get hit anymore.\n\nIf you ask me what really could have made a difference, I would have gotten rid of the optional island sequence, made the game longer (though I really like the option to attack the boss early, if you dare), and let the player start with a single mech and having more join the squad through the game. Too much is decided already with you deciding your entire loadout from the start.\n\n\nI'm done. I tried going back, tried wanting more. But I'm done.\nIt doesn't feel like there's anymore to come back for.\nThis game isn't FTL. Do not buy this game if you loved FTL and want more.\nBecause there is no FTL to be had here.

From a More... Civilized Time...\n\n         OR..... \n\"Five Minutes Ago... From A Galaxy... Actually... pretty similar to the last one.... and.... the one before that.... and....\"\n\n    Five hours in, this game is already very different from their last offering.\n\n   This is a good thing! Faster Than Light was brutally difficult even on easy. And for the casual gamer, or the worker looking to relax, a ten hour easy campaign to get randomly annihilated by a mother ship was... frustrating.\n\n   Behold! The easy mode is actually easy. And, thankfully, the difficulty curves exponentially, so the challenge is worthy of Subset Games vision of what a game should be. Perhaps Matt Davis and Justin Ma are rolling their eyes at that, but whatever. We cant all play a game just to lose.\n\n    The aesthetics of this game are very tight-  high contrast, post 8 bit format, lends to a unique, cartoonishly  hyper-realistic visual experience. It is ultimately appealing as the aesthetic is consistently reflected. I am never broken from the battle narrative by, \"Oh. That enemy looks stupid.\" or \"that attack doesnt feel... MEATY.\" The audio lends strongly to the battle experience, with a tight, edgy soundtrack by Ben Prunty.\n\n    The battles are strategically fun, with an interesting enemy forecasting mechanic that makes the game more chess like and much less random than Faster Than Light. That being said there is still a certain degree of randomness that is teeth clenchingly frustrating. You cannot save every building sometimes. Sometimes enemies will spawn and mass attack one important mission objective. But the various unique abilities of your mecha creat interesting oppertunites; the potential for clever tricks that leave you feeling like a cunning mecha general is pretty deep.\n\n   So far the only downside is how short it is! But this is a nice change from the grueling lenght of FTL. Since my free time dried up returning to community college for Computer Engineering, I suddenly find my self appreciating games with a 1.5 hour run time. I think the aesthetic of beggining in the hanger bay, and watching your mecha drop to the surface is a great metaphore for this game. Drop in. Blow some bugs up. Change timelines. Drop out. Repeat.\n\n   It is a throwback to the classic arcade style game where the emphasis was on learing the program, mastering the tricks and strategies, then endlessly replaying for that high score. Its not ment to be a long, experientially based offering. Rather, the emphasis is on replayability and comparmentalization of events. Play the game. Beat it. And do it again, because along the infinite, glittering curve of space time....\n\n                                                                                                   Theres always another damn bug.\n\n   I give this game 4/5 golden Shoggoths, a Golden Nightgaunt for sound track and audio, and a Silver Nightgaunt for battle mechancis and a bit of story. (But shout out to Chris Avalon, Black Isle whut, whut!) 15$ you cant go wrong!\n\n    (P.s. this is about the same rating I gave Witcher 3- this high rating is given relative to the scope of what the developers offered.

From Final Fantasy Tactics to Hoplite, nothing engages more than having thousands of lines of play, all of which could end your run outright, or give you a perfect turn that annihilates your enemies and gives you hope that you can win this game, and everything in-between.\n\nInto The Breach accomplishes this flawlessly and I don't use the word flawless lightly here. Every map in the game is tailor-made rather than procedurally-generated, and it really shows. The tight designs of these maps really make the experience feel extremely difficult, but very rarely unfair.\n\nEvery map is an 8x8 grid. You control 3 Mechs from the future. AI-controlled bug creatures are trying to exterminate the human race. Into The Breach flips the normal \"Mechs vs Aliens\" dynamic. Its the buildings filled with people that are important to protect, not necessarily your mechs. This adds so much depth and flavor to the game, as every single building is precious. When you lose too many, you lose the game. The crystal-clear UI for the game makes for a silky-smooth play experience, as you can easily absorb all the important information quickly to start formulating your lines of play for that turn.\n\nTo add to an already great strategy experience, you can unlock different sets of Mechs with completely different abilities. You can play these mechs as a set, or custom-make your own squad of mechs from the ones you've unlocked. Or, you can even roll a random squad of Mechs to send into the breach for a real challenge. You can also customize your mechs during your playthroughs for a different experience.

The soundtrack is eerily similar to FTL, which is a good thing. The premise is good, and being a roguelite with a reason (using Rogue Legacy as an example, each time you die your heir takes your place), is a good thing. It makes every loss and playthrough feel like it is just a continuation.\n\nThe game seems simple. The tutorial is pretty quick and you learn the fundamentals through it. The fundamentals stack like bricks allowing for more strategic decision-making in game. This is where the game becomes wonderful. With each SHORT mission (you can finish any mission in about 5 minutes),  you are presented with multiple tasks and scenarios. You have multiple things you need to accomplish and while the game might seem easy at first, most of the time you are not given the means to accomplish each of these things.\n\nWhen you fail to accomplish a small task, they build up. They wreck you. Do you want to save a pod for a future enhancement to aid in future missions? Well, it will cost you the pilot in your artillery mech... or a critical resource. It's a consistent series of critical thinking and decision making.\n\nIf you like FTL and turn-based strategy, you should get this. Especially with a $15 price tag and a free copy of FTL (which I gave to a friend). I do not regret this purchase.\n\nUpdated at about 50 hours of gameplay (including one night of sleeping and leaving it on of course):\n\nThe game still hasn't gotten old. The scenarios repeat themselves, but the decision making keeps things fresh. I have a lot of new pilots and have tried out a lot of the different squads. They all play a lot differently, and when I get through most of the squad specific achievements I'll be playing with custom squads because... some of these mechs are really fun and the combinations for combos and team efficiency will be a blast.\n\nAs one last note, I'd forgotten to mention to the devs:\n\nAs a color-deficient player, I've really appreciated the colorblind mode!", "timestamp_created": 1520014799, "timestamp_updated": 1520189513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40515415": {"recommendationid": "40515415", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962064321", "num_games_owned": 374, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3573, "last_played": 1521674532}, "language": "english", "review": "Would use Mantis pilot again. 10/10\n\nThe links to FTL are there for all you naysayers - specifically the mantis pilot I received in a escape pod.", "timestamp_created": 1520014119, "timestamp_updated": 1520014119, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40515356": {"recommendationid": "40515356", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969983655", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520293333}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

And I gotta say, about 10 hours into playing it I'm impressed. My only concern so far is replayability. While every single run in FTL is different even with the exact same ship every time (with unique crew and in different amounts, different weapon combinations, different systems, unique augments, and even some impactful side quests), most of your ITB run is determined from the start. Your mechs are decided from the beginning, and the only changes are the pilots you can accrue and the random add-ons that are either found or purchased at the end of an island. However, the combat itself is significantly more in-depth than FTL's, where you may be planning your attacks several turns in advance. All in all, I definitely am in love with it and its amazing soundtrack (classic Ben Prunty *swoon*), and if they give it the Advanced Edition treatment like with FTL, it will just be icing on the cake. \n\nGive me another hundred hours of playtime and I'll be back with more.", "timestamp_created": 1520007379, "timestamp_updated": 1520007379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40512904": {"recommendationid": "40512904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036594740", "num_games_owned": 319, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520523712}, "language": "english", "review": "Well I initially was on watch with this game when I found out who was developing it; the team who made FTL - in my opinion, one of the best Spaceship crew managment sims out there, one that blends RPG and RNG with a clear understanding of how \"Tactical battles\" should actually be tactical. \n\nAnd in Inot the Breach - they once again have shown themselves capable of delivering on that. Into the Breach plays out like a randomized persistent game of mini Chess problems that you solve with three Mechs - each Mech, like a Chess piece has it's own unique moveset and, Mechs come in 3s from different \"squads.\" Each squad has it's own gimick - for example, the starting three Mechs you're given heavily rely on pushback as a mechanic - using your bruiser Mech and pushback effects to keep the enemy away from your objectives - and your Mechs themselves, who're quite fragile if you let them take hits.\n\nThere are several different squads and each come with three unique mechs, and their own well thought out strategy - but where the game really gets interesting, is that you don't have to employ these pre-set squads and their pre-formulated startegies - you can mix and match. You can take the units from the Push and Pull squad and mix them with say the Smoke screen squad - any combination you can come up with. \n\nTo me that's the biggest plus of the game is that level of real strategy present in Chess has been successfuly translated into a Rogue-lite RPG. \n\nThe theme of the game as well as the artwork is also a major draw; think Live, Die Repeat meets Starship Troopers meets Pacific Rim. \n\nOverally I'd rate this game 8/10 and I'll list my very few qualms with this game below.\n\nCons: \n-Pricepoint of 17$ might be a little bit much, but I still highly recommend you support this studio\n-Could use a bit more content\n-This feels like a mobile game - and I want it to be one.\n\nGreat game though, from a very talented team - I look forward to seeing more from them in the future.

I wanted to love it, but I just don't. Apparently a lot of people do, but I wanted to give my opinions of the game, as it clearly wasn't a game for me.\n\nPros:\n-Great core gameplay\n-Solid challenge, that is hard, but fair\n\nCons:\n-Minimal improvement over the course of the run. In FTL (and roguelikes in general) you get substantially stronger during the run. In into the breach I felt like I could have almost as easily beaten the final level with base stats as with what  I have had in the actual runs.\n-Upgrades are uninteresting, and the currency mechanic as well. Not once have I felt like \"Oh yeah, this I want to buy\" at the end of an island.\n-The unlock system is tedious. It takes so long for me to unlock new squads I just don't want to do it.\n-Replay value is pretty low. This is related to the minimal improvements that happen during the run: all of the runs with the same squad just feel identical, and there is not much variety in how I played a certain squad. \n-No story or anything else to keep you involved.\n-The choice of how many islands you want to complete makes very little sense. There is no reward to be had by doing extra islands, and the final level scales, so it feels completely pointless. Coupled with the low scaling during a run, there is no feel of \"Oh yteah I want to pwn enemies with this build a bit more\".\n\nOverall the game is just a thinly packaged random puzzle generator.

A must for casuals, turn-based or indie game lovers. Highly replayable and worth your money. Full review below.\n___\n\n[i]Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and you know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and you know Earth, you may make your victory complete - Sun Tzu[/i]\n\nIf I were to describe this game in one sentence, it's like having a game of chess but you have to plan every possible options for the best outcome when everything is against you or it's game over. Into The Breach is a chess kind of turn-based PvE where it takes place in timelines of a planet facing the threat of an alien species known as Vek. You are the commander of a squad of three so-called \"Mechs\" each with a pilot that have skills when levelled up and your job is to protect the cities from the invasion of Vek. Sounds simple right?\n\nEasier said than done. By miles.\n\nDuring each battles you have to protect cities or facilities that both contain a bar of your power grid. The power grid is your 'health bar' in this game and if it reaches zero, game over. You don't get to recover much power and the grids' defense are as low as 15% to resist an attack so protect your cities/facilities at all cost. However, your Mechs also have HP as well. If they reach zero, your pilots will die like permadeath and your mech can't move until the battle is over. You also have the fact that your enemies, the Vek, all come in different abilities and pattern so they are unpredictable as ever. They even have reinforcements in every turn unless you stand on their spawing spot for a cost of 1 HP of your mech. How on earth are you gonna win then?\n\nWith a plan. No, the greatest plan with perfect execution for the sweetest smile on your face.\n\nEvery move and action in this game is crucial. Like chess, you must not only know your units capabilities but your enemy and your positions. Knowing your mechs abilities and stats will allow you to determine who to face and not face as well as avoiding unneccesary consequences on the next turn. Position is even more crucial as it determines a lot of factors such as movement, risks, enviromental hazards, blocking and knockback. Every battle/map may have enviromental hazards of different kinds and they INSTANT KILL everything, even bosses. Oh did I mention knockback in this game is a double-edge sword? IMO mostly good if executed well in your favour. and it feels so good. Plan your positions and/or actions every turn in the right order for the right execution and you'll have the greatest triumphant feeling at every turn when you get many ways to save your grids from Vek in such variety of ways. That's how everyone feels when a plan goes well.\n\nITB also has some roguelike elements that FTL had where you can get equipments, exp and cores to upgrade or give your mechs new abilities that can either change your playstyle or give you certain buffs/advantages. Pilots that are promoted will have new skills that could benefit you in battles so pay attention to what they can do. You are given bonus objectives which I highly recommend fulfilling if you wish to gain either more corporate points (money to buy equipments/upgrades/power at the end of a boss fight), mech equipments/upgrades and grid power that if full, will add extra grid power or defense if you have full power. Time pods also fall on the map and have super valuable equipments so grab them ASAP or defend them. While mech equipments can be equipped and unequipped, reactor cores are permanent so choose wisely. There is a lot to choose from so I do recommend trying them all...if it works for your squad's strategy.\n\nIf you either get a game over or win the game (with one pilot alive for both), that selected pilot will be the 'time traveller' and can be brought in into a new game for you to start over. A nice little advantage if you think the last game either went well and you wanted to try something harder or new or you wanted to have vengeance on those Vek.\n\nAchievements in this game btw rewards you with a coin that allows you to buy new sets of mechs with unique abilities. They come in form of mechas, tanks, artillery/ranged and so on. The greatest thing about this is that you can customize your own squad and have at least one 'mech' into your squad of 3. This is why the game is super replayable because every squad has a different playstyle and strategy and you have to plan how to synergize the squad. Some can pull, some have knockback, some are tanky, etc. Every mechs can have a variety of roles in your game which what makes the game so amazing. You make the team, you command them according to plan and watch Vek fall right below you.\n\nThe game also allows you to do unlimited redos but only for movements. If you attack/fire/use an ability you can never undo them. You could reset the entire turn yes but it is only used once per battle. Use it wisely and plan carefully because you only have 1 to 2 shots. What's even more intense is that some choices are inevitable and such sacrfices like a damage or a grid power loss is necessary for the best result. It's a bittersweet feeling but this gives a rollercoaster of emotions on your decisions. War is not won without sacrifices after all so pick the best strategy for the long run.\n\nOverall, I love this game  so much for actually rewarding you on planning and understanding the art of war. The only RNG elements you get are either the grid defense which barely helps much or enviromental hazards and those are just 10% of the game. The rest are all about outsmarting your enemy. They may make the first move but you have to make the best counterattack for the best result. You may be outnumbered, you may be weak, you may be cornered but the greatest plan and judgement at the end of the day will make you win the war. Into The Breach is a super fun, replayable and intense turn-based game that encourages smart play against the enemy and it feels real.\n\nThis game gets a 9/10. I would love this game to have some kind of online PvP or mods or even more content and I would have given this game a 10/10. Get the game. Highly recommended if you love turn-based games like Xcom/Fire Emblem/Advanced Wars and if you're a casual, do try it out! It's a must.\n\nNow excuse me as I need to get myself to review this game in another timeline.

And there's 2 more difficulties. Easy feels mostly fair though. Not sure what the higher difficulties change. Probably more enemies, maybe smarter, maybe more HP or special abilities, maybe less resources for you.\n\nIn any case, Into the Breach is a rogue-lite mechs-vs-monsters game. It is your goal to defend humanity vs. a monster invasion. To do so you have 3 mechs at your disposal, each differing from another not only visually but also in gameplay. You have to utilize your 3 mechs together to achieve victory. Some mechs shoot, some hit, some ram and take damage, others push or pull, some have long range, some special effects, area effects, etc. There's an almost endless mix of possibilities here. In order to win you have to save 2 to 4 islands. The choice is up to you. The more islands you successfully defend, the more resources you get to upgrade your mechs or your defenses, but the final battle will get harder as well, since you got stronger. Modular difficulty so to speak. This enables you to have quick 30 minute runs or drag the game out to over an hour, but the outcome is the same.\n\nBy completing the game and earning achievements you earn coins to unlock other squads. There are 8 in total. You only start with the basic one. Some are cheaper, some are more expensive, but each squad has 3 unique achievements you can complete. Together with the generic world achievements you will eventually get and some other hardcore achievements you shouldn't have too much trouble unlocking all squads. I'm currently missing 2 or 3 I think and I'm just playing with the 2nd squad now. And if that is not enough you can also create a custom squad with all unlocked mechs or let the AI cobble together a random one for you.\n\nAfter each defended island you will get the chance to spend your resources and upgrade your mechs if you want to. What you can get is mostly random, but upgrading your reactor core power will always enable you to plan at least somewhat ahead. More HP? More movement? More damage? Easy.\n\nCombat is turn based. The enemy always starts first, then it's your turn, etc. Enemies will attack your mechs and the buildings you need to protect. Losing a building means losing power. When all power is gone, your run is over. You can also get more power through missions or purchases and there is a certain chance that buildings will resist damage. Should one of your mechs fall in combat, however, it's gone for the remainder of the battle and its pilot usually dies, leaving you with a weaker mech, unless you have a spare pilot that has also earned XP in your run. Very precarious when you have mechs in your squad that deal damage by taking damage...\n\nAll in all it's a highly interesting game and the 2 hours to test it out should be enough to finish your first run and refund it if you hate it.", "timestamp_created": 1519993976, "timestamp_updated": 1519997868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40508276": {"recommendationid": "40508276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041407012", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 786, "last_played": 1521629935}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u982d\u3092\u4f7f\u3048\u3070\u4f7f\u3063\u305f\u5206\u3060\u3051\u89e3\u6cd5\u304c\u5897\u3048\u3066\u3086\u304f\u306e\u304c\u5b9f\u306b\u5fc3\u5730\u3044\u3044\u3002\n\u3053\u308c\u306f\u4eca\u5e74\u306e\u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\uff08\u6c17\u304c\u65e9\u3044\uff09\u3002\n", "timestamp_created": 1519993821, "timestamp_updated": 1519993821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508197", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40508008": {"recommendationid": "40508008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027477236", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520145153}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple yet elegant turn based strategy.", "timestamp_created": 1519992929, "timestamp_updated": 1519992929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40507886": {"recommendationid": "40507886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011603788", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1938, "last_played": 1521557420}, "language": "koreana", "review": "FTL\uacfc\ub294 \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \uc774-\uc9c0\ub294 \uc815\ub9d0 \uc774-\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ub178\ub9d0\uc740 \uc815\ub9d0 \ub178\ub9d0\ud558\uba70 \ud558\ub4dc\ub294 \uc815\ub9d0 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4. \ub2f9\uc2e0\uc774 \uc5c5\uc801\uac8c\uc774\ub77c\uba74 \uc774-\uc9c0\ub85c \uc5c5\uc801\uc744 \uc644\ub8cc\ud55c \uc774\ud6c4\uc5d0 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ucc9c\ucc9c\ud788 \uc990\uaca8\ubcfc\uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uac83\uc774\uace0, \uadf8\ub7f0\uac70 \uc2e0\uacbd \uc548 \uc4f4\ub2e4\uba74 \ud558\ub4dc\ud558\uac8c \ub2ec\ub824\ubcf4\uc790. \n\n\uc774\ub7ec\ub2c8\uc800\ub7ec\ub2c8 \ud574\ub3c4 \ud655\uc2e4\ud55c \uac83\uc740 \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uae30\ub300\ub97c \uc800\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1519992406, "timestamp_updated": 1519992406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40507871": {"recommendationid": "40507871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134687804", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 81, "last_played": 1520598542}, "language": "english", "review": "This game looks like and plays like games that I played in the past, gives me nostalgic vibes with a new atmosphere.", "timestamp_created": 1519992356, "timestamp_updated": 1519992356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40507803": {"recommendationid": "40507803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007839667", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520163264}, "language": "english", "review": "if you like the FTL game, you will love this game", "timestamp_created": 1519992076, "timestamp_updated": 1519992076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40507415": {"recommendationid": "40507415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003124462", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "last_played": 1520584454}, "language": "english", "review": "Everything is entirely RNG based.

just spent 30 minutes staring at the screen, stuck in a dilemma. There are 3 positive outcomes possible: I save 2 cities under attack, I destroy the remaining mountains with the acid thrower, and I can save one of my mechs. The problem is that  I can only acheive any 2 of those outcomes:\n\nI can save the city, and destroy the mountains, but the mech pilot will be killed, which is probably the correct approach, as mech pilots are supposed to be expendable. However, the mech pilot is fully levelled, and this the last island, so I can't replace them, which will make the finale harder.\n\nI can save the cities and the mech, but then the objective of destroying the mountain is impossible. While I am not losing the perfection bonus, having already failed previous objectives, I need any help I can get for the finale, and that extra reputation could be the difference between life and death.\n\nI can save the mech and destroy the mountains, but leave the cities to die. Obviously losing 2 grid power is bad, but despite this, I am tempted by the 18% resist chance that I only lose one grid power, and the 3% chance I could take no damage any way. This option has the tiniest chance of getting all three outcomes, but if it fails, it is clearly not the heroic option.\n\nI took the risk after 30 minutes of deliberations.\n\nThis is the part where I would like to tell you that 3 in a 100 chance came through and everything was great, but both buildings fell, killing 100s, and I ended up spending that reputation on getting back a power grid unit.\n\nThis is the story of the hardest decision I've ever taken in a video game, and the reason that Into the Breach might just be one of favourite games.", "timestamp_created": 1519989350, "timestamp_updated": 1519989350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40506913": {"recommendationid": "40506913", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960463271", "num_games_owned": 925, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1298, "last_played": 1521031116}, "language": "english", "review": "A truely unique strategy game that lives up to the hype behind the FTL studio.

It's very intuitive and tells you 90% of the information that will happenn. Imagine playing a turn-based war-game with tanks and mechs against giant insects--except the computer tells you EVERYTHING the computer is going to do that turn. It's up to you to reverse the effects. The game reminds you which tile is under threat and from which direction, so you can't scream you didn't know which direction the attack was coming from.\n\nBesides directly damaging opponents, you can also utilize various effects, such as pushing them into hazards (your units are amphibious even if not all of them can still fire however most land-based Vek are not; likewise a giant pit is fatal to anything that can't fly), or canceling their attacks straight off through a smoke-screen or something.\n\nAs a Rogue-lite, it also has some legacy effecst. If you fail completely, you are allowed to send one of your pilots back in time. This allows you to restart the beginning of the game except you have a decent pilot. You may not have an awesome vehicle that's been pimped out anymore but at least the pilot retains his/her/its skill. \n\nIf you get tired of playing the same pilots and squads over and over, you can unlock new pre-set squads and even random squads, similar to FTL's ships or Convoy's different starting options. \n\nThis game has the same level of polish that FTL does and has a lot less RNG involved. Sometimes you get a bad deal with the map spawning tilesets in a way you feel like you can't escape unscathed, but such is the case with any procedurally-generated game. The game permits you to completely reset a turn once a battle, as well as undo any action you've made provided it wasn't an attack or a special ability.\n\nI could gush and gush like a money-shot here but seriously this game is a must-have for ANY strategy enthusiast.", "timestamp_created": 1519981894, "timestamp_updated": 1520538371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40505100": {"recommendationid": "40505100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005333765", "num_games_owned": 3548, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519996140}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u4e00\u6b3e\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u6230\u68cb\u904a\u6232 \u76ee\u524d\u53ea\u6709\u82f1\u6587\u4f46\u96e3\u5ea6\u4e0d\u9ad8(\u7a0d\u5f8c\u6703\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u6587)\n\n\u4e00\u958b\u59cb\u7684\u6642\u5019\u4f60\u80fd\u9078\u4e00\u500b\u6a5f\u5e2b (\u904a\u6232\u5f8c\u671f\u80fd\u9078\u4e0d\u540c\u6a5f\u7a2e \u984f\u8272 \u7b49\u7b49)\n\u6bcf\u4f4d\u6a5f\u5e2b\u90fd\u6709\u4ed6\u5011\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7279\u8272 (\u6709\u7121\u65751\u56de\u5408\u7684\u8d77\u59cb\u76fe\u548c\u52a0\u7d93\u9a57\u7684..)\n\n\u4e4b\u5f8c\u958b\u59cb\u5728\u5cf6\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5340\u57df\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52d9\n\u56de\u5408\u6642\u9593\u70ba0\u5f8c \u6575\u65b9\u5c31\u6703\u64a4\u9000 \u6240\u4ee5\u8981\u76e1\u4f60\u6240\u80fd\u5b8c\u6210\u53ef\u9078\u4efb\u52d9\n\u6709 \u6bban\u540d\u6575\u4eba \u4fdd\u8b77xx\u5efa\u7bc9 \u4e0d\u8981\u6bba\u6b7b\u6307\u5b9a\u602a\u7269(\u8a72\u602a\u7269\u6b7b\u5f8c\u6703\u7206\u70b8)\n\u6575\u65b9\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7279\u6027(\u98db\u884c,\u7206\u70b8,\u5718\u968a\u52a0\u8840) \u54c1\u7a2e\n\u5730\u9762\u55ae\u4f4d\u9032\u6c34\u88e1\u5c31\u6703\u6b7b\u4ea1\n\u6211\u65b9\u55ae\u4f4d\u9032\u6c34\u88e1\u5c31\u6703\u4e0d\u80fd\u653b\u64ca\n\u5404\u8272\u5404\u6a23\u7684\u6230\u8853\u914d\u642d \u5c31\u8a95\u751f\u4e86\n\u4f8b\u5982\u6211\u65b9\u9ad8\u5c04\u70ae \u80fd\u64ca\u9000\u843d\u9ede4\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u6575\u4eba\n\u6575\u65b9\u649e\u5411\u53cb\u65b9\u55ae\u4f4d\u6703\u4f7f\u4ed6\u53d7\u52301\u9ede\u50b7\u5bb3\n\u963b\u7919\u6575\u65b9\u51fa\u751f\u9ede \u6703\u53d7\u52301\u9ede\u50b7\u5bb3 \u4f46\u80fd\u6253\u5c111\u96bb\u602a\u7269 \u7b49\u7b49..\n\n\u904a\u6232\u8a2d\u6709undo \u548c\u91cd\u7f6e\u9019\u56de\u5408\n\u524d\u8005\u80fd\u591a\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528 \u5f8c\u8005\u6bcf\u5834\u904a\u6232\u53ea\u80fd\u4f7f\u75281\u6b21\n\u904a\u62321\u9031\u76ee\u5f8c \u9084\u80fd\u518d\u73a9 \u5167\u5bb9\u6b21\u5e8f\u4e5f\u4e0d\u76f8\u540c\n\n\u7e3d\u62ec\u800c\u8a00 \u8b93\u6211\u518d\u73a9\u4e00\u5c40\u518d\u4f86\u66f4\u65b0\u8a55\u8ad6\u5427\n\n\u76ee\u524d\u8cfc\u8cb7\u9084\u9001  FTL: Faster Than Light \n(\u5982\u679c\u8cfc\u8cb7\u52a0\u5165\u8cfc\u7269\u8eca\u4e0a\u65b9\u9084\u6709\u5beb Get a free copy of FTL: Faster Than Light with purchase. \nAlready own it?

I have nearly every mech team unlocked. Multiple victories. And currently achievement hunting. There are some things I've noticed about Into the Breach both good and bad. Of course being spoiler-free as best I can.\n\nLets start off with the bad. Ultimatly, it doesn't seem to matter who you have on your team or what equipment you use. I can only count one time so far that the enemy was doing something I could literally not stop. Every other time it was purely bad positioning on my part, or not fully understanidng what tools I had access to. Every turn is a puzzle game version of chess. To achieve this, Into the Breach has AI that takes into account what you can actually do and tailors the enemy to allow you to beat them. For example, one of the mechs can upgrade to drop fire behind them when they shoot their main gun. Before getting this upgrade I never saw a time to use it at all. In fact, I only picked it up originally because I was going for an achievement. However the very next game after I upgraded it I had TWO moments where that ability was super important to my actions. Now I prioritize upgrading my base stats like movement, damage, and health instead of new abilities or equipment. The only new perks I get are those that would outright prevent damage to structures or things that prevent issues I've had. The more options I have the more complicated each puzzle becomes since there are more ways the situation can play out. This has caused it to feel like none of my choices going into a game matter. It's all about what flavor of defeating the enemies I go with.\n\nWhat also adds to that feeling is the somewhat small equipment pool available to you. There is just enough for each mech team to have almost entirely unique gear, and that is it. I have one more mech team to unlock, and I suspect that the equipment I've seen in shops that I've yet to be able to start with all belong to them. The best you have to really tailor your team is the time travelling pilot you pick. There are a sizable amount of them to unlock and each one has a \"perk\" that can actually alter how that mech plays significantly. One give you a shield, one let you hover, one gives you one more \"retry\" per game, etc etc. When you beat the game or lose entirely you can pick one of your pilots to start with again. Keeping their perks and experience for the next game. However once you are getting through games all the way to the end and not really losing any pilots you are actually incentivised not to ever change them. I've had one pilot for 5 victories now. Because if I change him, I lose the bonus experience perks they have now. Whoever else I pick, the AI will account for and I will not have really gained much. Just changed the flavor of the game slightly and then lost the bonus perks. Into the Breach needs a bit of an expansion to the equipment pool and to have earned experience not matter for the special pilots. I want to have unique, cool items I can only find in shops. Maybe have them be rare or expensive. But as it stands if I see something cool in a store I just pick the mech team that starts with that next game. And there are so many cool pilots that I don't want to bother leveling up to try.\n\nThat was a sizable chunk of \"bad\" I know. Lets move on to the positives here. Into the Breach has kinda taken over right now. With the UI being very easy and a focus on thinking through your options and careful planning, I can play the whole thing with a mouse. Which is absolutely fantastic as someone who only really plays games when watching streams and catching up on videos. It's the type of casual, relaxed game that I have been sorely lacking in my life at the moment. The music is good, however I have gotten to the point in my life where every game is almost entirely muted so I only enjoyed it for about the first 8 or so hours before videos and such took priority. The art at first I thought was really simple and basic but once I had really busy moments I was very VERY grateful that the aesthetic is what it is. A couple of things need a bit of work in that department but it's so rare it even comes up that it's a pass.\n\nThe comments above about the flavor of the games being all you pick sounds like its kinda \"meh\" at first. But holy crap is each team super different. I won't be saying much about them for obvious reasons, but it is really difficult to overstate how much each mech team causes you to completely change how you play. Their passives coupled with their weapons, hell, the amount of distance they can move even. All force you to rework your strategies against the Vek. Some are more passive, just keeping enemies away from buildings as they eventually die. Others bring the righteous fury of the gods on the heads of the creatures so hard you almost feel bad for them. Some are reactive, causing you to carefully see what the Vek do. while others are active, purposfully placing traps and triggering them to deal bonus damage. It's clear that a LOT of time went into each mech team. I am both excited and sad to unlock that last team. I am excited because its going to be a really cool new way to see the encounters I've had so much before. But at the same time I am sad that it will be the last one of the new teams I will get. However there is a lot I have yet to learn about the various teams, so I can just explore them more while I continue playing after getting this last team. I have the \"randomize team\" button that will probably keep me going for quite some time.\n\nIn the end. I love it. I would like to see more ability to change my team as I go through the missions, and even more mission parameters or grids. The mechs you can pick are really unique and WILL force you to change your gameplay. It's nice knowing that so long as I don't actively screw myself over I can probably get out of any situation with no damage to my grid. And the mouse-only nature of it for me lets me play this while doing other things. If you are looking for a new puzzle game, or a strategy game, then I would suggest picking up Into the Breach.", "timestamp_created": 1519975257, "timestamp_updated": 1519979248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40503436": {"recommendationid": "40503436", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985585667", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 694, "last_played": 1521113026}, "language": "english", "review": "Update 2:  Now, having played for 36 hours as of writing this, beating it numerous times on normal and hard, I'm ajusting my score.  I feel like I was too harsh with my critique.  A lot of my criticism came from the fact that it is mislabled as a roguelike SRPG, when it is more like a board game.  I feel that by advertising themselves as an SRPG roguelike they are doing themselves a diservice, because people like myself have their expectations set on a different experience.\nImagine if Portal were advertised as a sci-fi FPS, by the makers of Half-Life, and you have been playing FPSes since Wolfenstien 3D.  You would probably be dissapointed initially that it was more accurately a physics based puzzle-platformer.\nImagine your friend offers to take you out for a steak dinner, and as you are sitting there, ready to dig into a nice juicy, charbroiled steak, they serve you carpaccio.  Sure, it may be beef, and you could eat it for dinner, but you would likely be very dissapointed with your \"steak dinner,\" even if there was noting wrong with your carpaccio.\nInto the Breach, despite not accurately being an SRPG roguelike, is a good puzzle RPG/boardgame, so I'm updating my score to an 8, and that's probably going to be where is stays barring any major content updates.\n\nUpdate 1:  Now 22 hours in, having beaten it 4 times with 2 teams, I'm downranking it from 7.5-8 to a 7.  The game is becoming monotonous, I have to break up my playthoughs into several sessions.  Also, my last playthrough, as I was deep in the Vek volcano, looking at the tendrils wiggeling about in the walls, and seeing the tenticles coming up from below, I felt incredibly disapointed that there was no final boss in the end, just the same old boring enemies.  I don't know if I will be able to sustain enough interest to unlock everything in this game, as was my initial intention.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nSo... I beat it.  Cleared all four islands and completed the final objective on the volcano island on my third playthrough.  It took me a little over 3 hours of playtime to do so.  Obviously I'm not done, I still have a bunch of factions and acheivements to unlock, but I feel like I have seen enough to render a review.\nI bought this game strictly on three grounds: I love FTL, and I love SRPGs, and I love roguelikes/roguelites.  So, let me address the three in order.\n\n1. FTL\nYou can tell that this was the same development team as FTL straight from the menus.  The loading icon is even the same.  Is this game like FTL? ...no.  Other than visuals, ergonomics, and progression system, the games are very different. FTL is realtime with pause.  This is turn based.  In FTL the scope is narrower but deeper.  You have one ship at a time, but there was so much you could do with it, and there were so many playstyles.  You had a bunch of different weapons with different effects that you could synergize together.  You could play without weapons and only use drones.  You could use mind control.  You could board ships.  You could disable life support systems.  The list goes on. \nIn this game you play as three mechs, and all you essentially do is attack or push enemies around the playfield.\nIs this game as good as FTL?  No.  FTL is a masterpiece, an essential piece of gaming history.  This game I would not classifiy as a masterpiece.\n\n2.  SRPG\nStrategy Role Playing Games (aka Tactical Role Playing Games) are top down tactics games where you manipulate your characters in a grid, typically from an isometric perspective, moving them around and attacking one turn at a time. What makes it an RPG is that the units gain experience from combat and level up, and carry equipment.  Some examples of SRPGs are Tactics Ogre, Final Fantasy Tactics, Front Mission, Fire Emblem, Advance Wars, and Disgaea.  Is this game like those games?  Not really.  The game it most resembles is Advance Wars, but you generally only command three units at a time in Into the Breach, there is no base capturing, there is no unit generation, and there are no in battle resources to spend, there is no fog of war, the maps are all the same (square) shape, the maps are much smaller, there are far less types of units, there are no ally units, or commanders.  Honestly this game feels much more like a puzzle game than an SRPG.  You have to survive 5 rounds of enemies spawning in.  Your \"life\" is tied to the buildings in the game.  Everytime a building is destroyed, one unit of power is removed from the powergrid shown at the top of the screen.  Run out of power and you lose.  How you stop the enemies from destroying your buildings is by pushing them around the field or destroying them, or interupting their attack by freezing them or putting them in dust clouds.  That is esentially it.\nIs this game as good as those SRPGs I listed?  No, those are seminal entries in the genre.\n\n3.  Roguelike/Roguelite\nADOM, Caves of Qud, TOME, Nethack, Brogue, Pixel Dungeon, these are roguelikes.  Into the Breach is not a traditional roguelike.  Would I categorize it in the more nebulous genre of roguelite?  ...no.  Your toolset and the interactions are far more limited, and the action is turnbased while games in the roguelite genre are typically realtime, like Binding of Issac, Spelunky, FTL, Nuclear Throne, etc.  I'd say this game would more accuratly be categorized under the puzzle roguelike subgenre, like Desktop Dungeons, Hoplite, Road Not Taken, and perhaps UnExplored.  Is this a good puzzle roguelike?  Well, I am not a fan of puzzle roguelikes, so I can't say authoratively, but I will say that the \"puzzles\" are very carefully balanced, and I never encountered a moment where I would have to take power grid damage or fail an objective without making a tactical error.  In fact I feel that it is too balanced, but that is likely just my preference for the other genres listed.  In SRPGs, by carefully leveling up and equiping your characters, you can overpower your enemies, although they typically outnumber your units.  Or you may encounter overwhelmingly powerful boss units, and have to lure them into traps to beat them.  The variety in challenge makes it exciting.  In roguelites, the rendomness and interactions can make for exciting chaotic events, like in Spelunky, when you grab an idol and it crashes into an offscreen shop, which pisses off the shopkeeper, who then hops around the map, killing everything in sight before impaling himself on spikes.  Similar situations also occur in traditional roguelikes.\n\nSo, ultimately do I like this game?  Yes.  Is it a good game?  Yes.  Is it a great game?  No.  What would make it a better game?  I would prefer if there was more depth overall.  I feel that it needs more map shapes, bigger play fields, more units to command, and more variety in playstyles.  I hate how every enounter is 5 turns.  I also don't like that every encounter is against waves of unknown enemies spawning from randomized locations, limiting your ability to prepare for battle.  I also hate how every encounter is so carefully balanced and that there is a right and wrong way to deal with every encounter.  If you play correctly, you will never take grid damage or lose an objective.  If you make a tactical error at a critical moment (after using up your 1 retry turn ability) it may cost you the game.  The game feels like the skeleton of a better game.  I wish that the mechs had the depth of play that FTL has.  Hopefully the developers continue to add more meat to that skeleton and flesh out the gameplay.\n\nTLDR\nAs of right now I'll give it 7.5-8/10.  An 8x8 grid is too small.  3 units are too few.  5 rounds every battle is too limiting.  Constant, random waves of enemies every match is tiresome.  The game is still fun and addicting, it just feels very limited, and at times, frustrating.", "timestamp_created": 1519974052, "timestamp_updated": 1520858105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 159, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.864480", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40503314": {"recommendationid": "40503314", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996953567", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 220, "last_played": 1520856365}, "language": "german", "review": "Turn based strategy at its best .                              \n\nIt looks like a gem, but it's a monster .\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1519973381, "timestamp_updated": 1519973381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40503297": {"recommendationid": "40503297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028596057", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520103890}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0420\u0435\u0431\u044f\u0442, \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u043e\u0436\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 - \u044d\u0442\u043e \u041d\u0415 FTL2 - \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430. \n\nITB - \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0448\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044b 20!8 \u0441 \u0443\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0433\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044f\u043c\u0438. \u0418 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0435\u0442 - \u0438\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0448\u044c \u043f\u043e 5 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0434 \u043e\u0431\u0434\u0443\u043c\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0445\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0443 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430, \u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0443\u043c\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f.\n\n\u041b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 \u043b\u0438 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u043c FTL - \u0443\u0432\u044b, \u043d\u0435\u0442. \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430 \u043b\u0438 \u043e\u043d\u0430 - \u0447\u0451\u0440\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u044c\u043c\u0438 \u0434\u0430, \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0443.", "timestamp_created": 1519973297, "timestamp_updated": 1519973297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567191", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40503295": {"recommendationid": "40503295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005404433", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520479670}, "language": "english", "review": "FTL meets Advance Wars meets something else entirely.\n\n\n11/10.", "timestamp_created": 1519973284, "timestamp_updated": 1519973284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40503165": {"recommendationid": "40503165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013180268", "num_games_owned": 484, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "last_played": 1520543281}, "language": "english", "review": "Into the Breach is a strategy game for strategy game fans.

That said though, it's so mechanically strong and provides such an incredibly well designed, engaging, and user friendly experience that I urge everyone to play it, even if you're not a fan of the genre.

The challenge of the final map seems only to be the RNG which can screw you and offer you no way out.\n\nThere is promise, and room, for the game to grow and add new layers of challenge. I don't know if the developers will get to that though. \n\n- The enemy variety isn't overwhelming by any means. Some people compare it to chess, but it's much more checkers. The attack variety is pretty limited, and you get a few rewarding situations where you break up a similarly sticky puzzle, but that's much more what it is than a strategy game. It's a perpetually evolving puzzle you have to solve, and you are 100% reactive.\n\nAll that said though, it's very well done, the idea of saving a pilot and sending them back as a time traveler to power up your next attempt is pretty sweet. There are a massive number of mechs that can be unlocked and built into interesting custom combinations - so I will hold out hope that the game will grow to make that something worth doing.

The game however does not play almost anything like Advanced Wars but instead much more like a puzzle game. The game is very cut and dry. Given thought it's almost certain you'll win every time. It holds very few elements that are both random and something that you can't deal with. This steps away from the formula of FTL but that's not to say that the love there doesn't carry over. Let's dive into what makes this game what it is and see if it's worth your time.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n\n[b]Visuals[/b]:\nThe game is immediately quite pretty. I don't think I have to tell you this but I should mention it in this review to give the designers credit where it's due. The pixel graphics are well shaded and set up the foundation for a satisfying game. Following this is the animation quality which is equally good if not better. This is clearly seen when you [url=https://youtu.be/5XHEyH6diV8?t=35s]click on a map[/url] to start the battle. The moving and fighting animations themselves are simple but fit the game well.\n\n[u]The game is pretty and offered solid animations to boot.[/u]\n\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]:\nMoving to the gameplay itself the game holds up remarkably well. At its core the game is a struggle for survival in both the lore and each individual match. This is something that is not immediately obvious until you start seeing the game. Each and every single mission has the same goal. [i]Survive 5 turns[/i]. Immediately this appeared to be something that would quickly become stale but instead it acts as the perfect goal for the formula. On top of this moving units is a large theme and is quite powerful. Not always is it necessary to kill any of the bugs. Simply displacing them might be enough as enemies don't change what they are about to do regardless of what happens to them.\n\nBefore I continue it's important to note that enemies broadcast everything they do loud and clear to the player. On top of this if an enemy plans on attacking the space in front of it then it won't change it's behavior. So if you were to drag a bug in front of another bug then it would attack and potentially kill it's friend. So let me recap. The game gives you all the information on what is about to happen in the following turn, it sets up movement and attack based puzzles and makes succeeding at them efficient and satisfying.\n\n[u]To put it more simply the gameplay is a unique masterpiece that was done with love.[/u]\n\n\n[b]Variety[/b]:\nThe variety that the game poses is perfect. There are enough enemies that you'll see a different puzzle all the time, enough maps, map tiles and map modifiers, mechs, items, pilots that you'll be sated for quite some time on variety. Also unlike many games the different items and variety can really change how you look at a battle and how you play. The different puzzle pieces mix alarmingly well and present an entire new dimension once any of them encounter a new one. In some rogue likes the variety sort of melts into the bigger picture and the joy of seeing new stuff is lost after some time. After 8 hours of play I still am seeing the joy in the combinations that can be seen.\n\n[u]The game offers a huge amount of variety that mixes really well with other bits of variety to stay fresh.[/u]\n\n\n[b]Unlocks and Achievements[/b]:\nSomething else to mention is the unlock system which is a gigantic step up from FTL's system while changing very little. The game has several sets of mechs. Each set has 3 mechs that function quite differently but hold some kind of theme such as smoke clouds, dealing damage, linking enemies in connected lines. Each set of mechs also has 3 achievements for you to attempt to get. There are also general achievements that apply to any gameplay run that you do. Each achievement you complete gets you a coin and you can spend these to get a new set of mechs. This means however that you don't have to play and hope for random events to get the new mechs that you want. This differs from FTL as you had to do things in the run that were likely random and wouldn't guarantee you the ship you wanted.\n\n[u]The unlock system has you earn coins for achievements that you can buy new squads with.[/u]\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]:\n[i]If you don't want a game that has you thinking long and hard about moves to make like you're peering at a chessboard then immediately I would advise you to avoid this game or at the very least read this sentence again[/i]. It really is closer than anything to a puzzle or a very deep abstract strategy game and this won\u2019t appeal to everyone. There is very little luck that will suddenly let you win or randomly wipe you completely.\n\n[u]The puzzle like gameplay certainly isn't for everyone.[/u]\n\n\n[b]Story and Theme[/b]:\nFurthermore the story and theme is quite thin. The theme of the game is the idea of jumping from timeline to timeline in attempts to stop gigantic bugs from destroying the town is quite thin. All that being said this doesn\u2019t particularly bother myself. However much like a good porn I\u2019m not here for the story.\n\n[u]Story and theme are quite thin.[/u]\n\n\n[b]Game Length and Pacing[/b]:\nOn top of this the game isn't terribly hard to finish in about 2h or less. My first run on the game was a success and I beat the boss all the way. That's not to say there isn't difficulty. The game has achievements that mean something, hard mode, different mech combos that are much harder or easier to use and challenge runs but it doesn\u2019t take long enough to become invested and it\u2019s not nearly short enough per mission to be snappy and short like a floor from binding of isaac\n\n[u]Game length is awkward and is too long per mission and too short in the full playthrough.[/u]\n\n\n[b]Progression[/b]:\nThe choices on upgrades is something you don\u2019t get a whole bunch. For many this might be a deal killer. Every 5 or 6 missions or so you get to spend your points on upgrades to get for your mechs. This would be fine but missions usually take a lot of thought and by proxy a lot of time. This can lead to breaks between progression feeling larger than almost any other rogue like/lite game out there. There is still xp that you get and your pilots will gain new skills but you don\u2019t get to buy for about 30 minutes sections.\n\n[u]Progression is minimal and fits in with the poor pacing the game sometimes provides.[/u]\n\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nFor 15$ I think this game is an easy buy. It\u2019s not only satisfying and pretty but holds a good variety to keep you coming back time after time. The game\u2019s faults are really minor and haven\u2019t bothered me a whole lot.

So far, so good. Not too spectacular a formular for a turn-based tactics game. Except that Into the Breach plays extremely fast, every match just takes five turns on a tiny 8x8 grid. That is it. The next mission awaits. The base-mechanics are clean-cut and easy to learn, the difficulty, however, can be brutal - especially on hard and with one of th weaker, more puzzle-ish squads like the Steel Judokas. This minimalist approach to map size and gameplay is met with several options to customize your squadt. The ten base squads (which you can unlock) all play differently and require fairly different approaches to problem-solving. And last but not least, the game has this \"just one more game\" quality to it. \n\nInto the Breach is not as innovative as FTL was, but it took the best parts from a genre I liked anyways, stripped them down to the core and mixed in a big bag of customization options.

You will also keep new continent access once you have unlocked them. This review is based on the \"Normal Mode\" level of difficulty.\n\n*********************************************************************\n\n[h1]How the game is played:[/h1]\n\nYou will deploy a Combat Mech (powerful punch attack), Cannon Mech (ranged attack that cannot initially fire through obstacles), and Artillery Mech (ranged attack that can fire over obstacles) with complimentary abilities to protect civilians housed in buildings and the additional objective specific to each map. Hazards abound, and you will quickly find yourself scrambling to position your mechs in the best possible way to take out the enemy while mitigating damage and trying to keep new bugs from surfacing from cracks in tiles. \n\nThinking ahead is the name of the game, as you will often find yourself short on actions, with only the three mechs limited to moving and attacking (or repairing), and pray none of them get webbed in place. Be wary of your actions, however, as they often will have consequences. You can damage assets and your other mechs if they are parked next to an enemy you fired on, or if you knock a bug preparing to fire into their line of attack on the map's grid. Directionality is an important consideration when attacking, as you will frequently knock targets away onto another tile. This can be very advantageous for knocking them into water, into mountains for additional damage, into the line of fire of another enemy or physically into another enemy, damaging both targets. \n\nPilots level up after achieving enough XP to do so, unlocking new abilities to help you power through. Upon defeat, you will be allowed to keep one pilot out of a maximum of three to begin your next attempt.\n\nWin conditions typically take on the form of repelling and/or mitigating enemy attacks for a certain number of rounds depending on the map (such as protecting a train until it has escaped the map or keeping civilian/corporate buildings and power generators intact for X number of turns). You will also be given bonus objectives on each map, such as protecting friendly tanks or destroying a dam to flood a section of the map. Bonus objectives reward you with quality of life upgrades to aide you in your progression. You will also earn reputation as a currency, which can be spent on weapon upgrades or supplies. You can sell unused weapons and pilots in exchange for additional reputation.\n\n\"Game Over\" if you lose all of your mechs before exhausting the turns required to win, if your power grid meter becomes empty, or if your primary objective has failed.  \n\n[h1]What I liked:[/h1]\n+ Unique and exciting strategy gameplay. Nice to see new and innovative tactics.\n+ The pixel art is absolutely top notch. Just beautiful.\n+ Fantastic user interface. Very clean.\n+ Music is soft, mysterious, and pleasing...this is especially important with the high replayability. You will be hearing it a lot.\n+ Sound effects are appropriate and satisfying. \n+ You are allowed one turn reset per map.\n+ Option for Easy, Normal, and Hard modes.\n+ I loved that Into the Breach had me obsessing about tactics while I was away from my PC.\n\n\n[h1]Room for improvements:[/h1]\n- Sometimes, the randomness just royally screws you at the worst times, like at the end of a hot streak when you are doing particularly well and nearing the completion of a continent. You won't always be equipped to deflect every building attack while trying to block surfacing bugs, while webbed, with the current bugs spread out across the map and hazards in between. It's going to happen.\n\n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1]\nA thoughtful, well-designed and deeply challenging tactical strategy rogue-lite game that isn't afraid to bring fun, fresh ideas to the table.

Nice pixel art and ok music. It does not have the unexplainable, magical fun of FTL.\n\n\nGraphic and Sound:\n16-bit game console style graphics and a bit noisier ambient back ground music that loop a bit too hard, plus Okay sound effect. I like the graphics better than the music and sound. \n\nGame Difficulty:\nYou die when you die, the game is very punishing. Fortunately unlocked mechs and pilots  would be available for a new run as long as you don't delete your profile by mistake.\n\nThere is an interesting thing about difficulty that I experienced: Easy mode is too easy, while Normal is hard but manageable without too much power gaming, and Hard is a bit too hard. By \"too easy\" I mean you basically play the game with muscle memory most of the time, like playing Candy Crush,\n\nIt seems the difficulty increase from Easy to Hard is not linear. I wish there is a difficult mode with difficulty between Easy and Normal just for casual play, say during work breaks. That would be perfect.\n\n\nReplayablity:\n*I literally lived on TV dinners for five days when FTL came out.*\n\nI would say ITB does not have as much replayable value as FTL. Surely you can unlock various mechs, they do change the gameplay. HOWEVER, after 10 hours of playing you would have seen most of it: punching enemies, shooting enemies, pulling enemies, pushing enemies, making body chains for group electric shock...etc. If your goal is to unlock all new mechs through grinding and tryhard, yes go for it, you will have scores of hours gameplay. But if what you seek are surprises and the unexplainable, magical fun as you got from FTL, no.\n\nI wish the game could include a quick mode, meaning having a random battle with random mechs and pilots you unlocked, which does not affect the progress of your profile. That would be great for gamers who just want to crush some bugs once in a while or when the time is tight for prolonged gaming.\n\nStoryline and Dialogue:\nOkay for a turn-based strategy game. We got Chris Avellone as writer here, I wish he can make a new Planescape game..\n...................................................................................\nI will add more information of the game if I get any from my gaming experience.", "timestamp_created": 1519922809, "timestamp_updated": 1519928669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

Not really, but anyone wanting a rogue-litey strategy game and isn't turned off by the complete lack of sense of progression may like it. Clearly, people do like it given the reviews, but I would suggest they're pretty easy to please.\n\nIt's okay, but much like FTL, it really wears thin after a while. In fact, I only had fun with the first run and have found it to be rather dull afterwards.\n\nThe main issue is the problem that plagued FTL: The game has a system of progression throughout each run, but it's so binary and unrewarding it's unreal. You very rarely pick up goodies, and can barely ever equip them.\nThe game is also rather easy, or that is to say, its difficulty as a base is easy, and is only hampered by the squad you pick. Given that you start with the strongest team of all rounders, it's hard to see what would keep you playing aside from fun, but for that, see above. Also with the game not feeling rewarding or progressing through each round, most of the mechs that are unlocked are pretty specialized, and will live-or-die based upon the RNG roll of equipment - again, much like FTL. It's just kind of tedious and doesn't keep you playing when you already have the best team, and have beaten the game pretty easily beforehand.\n\nThey need to start thinking of how they reward and keep the interest going for the player. The fact they reward you with worse mechs is kind of baffling.\n\nSeems like they never learned from FTL's RNG plagued system that leads to frustration and feeling really bored throughout.", "timestamp_created": 1519920596, "timestamp_updated": 1519921341, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455680", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40490094": {"recommendationid": "40490094", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987733880", "num_games_owned": 513, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 171, "last_played": 1520783765}, "language": "english", "review": "This game deserves all of the hype it gets and more.

Zum einen haben die 3 Einheiten unterschiedliche F\u00e4higkeiten, zum anderen gibt es auf jedem Einsatzgebiet immer wieder Besonderheiten oder spezielle Ziele die man zus\u00e4tzlich zur Feindabwehr erf\u00fcllen muss/kann. Manchmal muss man z.B. als Zusatzziel einen Damm zerst\u00f6ren. Tut man dies wird aber ein Teil der Karte mit Wasser \u00fcberflutet. Manchmal gibt es vulkanische Aktivit\u00e4ten oder Unwetter auf einigen Feldern, was zu Sch\u00e4den an den gerade dort stehenden Einheiten f\u00fchrt oder man muss nebenher Terraforming betreiben, was ebenfalls Einfluss auf den Ablauf des Kampfes hat.\n\nDas macht jede Runde wieder von neuem spannend und l\u00e4sst zumindest bisher keine Langeweile aufkommen. Daneben steigen mit der Zeit auch die F\u00e4higkeiten der Piloten und man kann zu bestimmten Zeitpunkten die 3 Kampf-Mechs aufr\u00fcsten, was ebenfalls zu neuen Kampfoptionen f\u00fchrt.\n\nDie K\u00e4mpfe sind zumindest im Schwierigkeitsgrad \u201enormal\u201c hervorragend ausbalanciert und immer wieder fordernd.\n\nWas ich auch gut finde, die einzelnen Runden dauern nicht allzu lange. Man kann also auch mal ein oder zwei Runden zwischendurch spielen ohne gleich ein paar Stunden Zeit einplanen zu m\u00fcssen. Der Spielstand wird nach jeder Runde gespeichert, so dass man sp\u00e4ter bequem weitermachen kann. Gespeichert wird allerdings immer nur der aktuelle Fortschritt, mehrere Speicherst\u00e4nde sind NICHT m\u00f6glich. Das finde ich aber gut, so muss man sich immer gut \u00fcberlegen was man als N\u00e4chstes tut. Das macht es f\u00fcr mich sehr viel spannender und interessanter, als wenn man st\u00e4ndig neu laden und einen einzelnen Einsatz immer wieder neu durchspielen kann. Wenn Alles schief l\u00e4uft, f\u00e4ngt man wieder fast ganz von vorne an die Welt zu retten. Nur einen Piloten mit seinen gesammelten Erfahrungen kann man mit ins neue Spiel nehmen. \n\nAber auch wenn ich gerade zu Beginn mehrfach komplett neu anfangen musste, hatte das (wegen der schon genannten wechselnden Rahmenbedingungen und Zusatzziele je Runde) bisher keinen Einfluss auf den Spielspa\u00df.\n\nDie etwas einfache gehaltene Grafik ist stimmig und passt gut zum Spiel.\n\nAlles in allem ein super Spiel und sein Geld in jedem Fall wert.\n\nDas Einzige was ich nicht nachvollziehen kann, ist der teilweise Hype um den Soundtrack. Der Sound im Spiel ist v\u00f6llig normal und auch passend, aber in keiner Weise herausragend oder besonders. Ein zus\u00e4tzlicher Kauf des Soundtracks lohnt also nicht.\n", "timestamp_created": 1519918810, "timestamp_updated": 1519918810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40489595": {"recommendationid": "40489595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158317322", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520059754}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fbe\u4e0d\u6210\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4e0d\u901a\u5173\u7684\u5f3a\u8feb\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u614e\u5165\uff0c\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u5efa\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528Git\uff0c\u65b9\u4fbfSL", "timestamp_created": 1519918761, "timestamp_updated": 1519918761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40489593": {"recommendationid": "40489593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010237147", "num_games_owned": 900, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1520689262}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautifully done!

Or, you can play through a whole campaign if you have a couple hours to spare.\n\nSeems to have a lot of replayability.

It's a great game, I like challenge and the combat system. All the Meks are cool and different, they even have a rest button once a battle, were you can go \"OH S#!%\". Enemies are cool, there plenty of them, damn Pisions will kick your butt if you let them live! \n\nThe only thing I'd complain about is there are times I've reset rather than deal with the enemy taking me out. But that could be me just being Tactically picky. Some of the weapons feel weak, and you can only buy things after you complete an Island. But the most of the weapons are cool, and give you a lot of options to drown these damn bugs!

The matches are extremely fragile and there are often very costly lessons, which makes victory satisfying. The tactics are refreshing. You can kill things traditionally but you have the option of abrupting enemy attacks, making enemeies attack eachother, using the environment to kill enemies, or straight blocking enemy spawns. There is an emphasis on pushing and pulling of units that is unique for this Turn based strategy. The art, environment and dare I say atmosphere are great for any mechaloving post apocalytpic. It is a dark feeling to see the civilians in the game cheer for you as you spawn, only for you to be forced to smash a creature into their city to surivive the last wave.

It even gets more interesting when perfect solution does not exist, as the situation forces the player to make interesting choices: should i sarifice my pilot, or the civilians, or the power up? How can i minimize the loss? Thanks to simplicity of mechanic and carefully crafted user interfaces which demonstrate how player/opponent attacks work, the game is extremely easy to learn and the player can counter unseen enemies right on the spot. I cannot praise this game enough for its mechanic simplicity and UI design that help the player solve the problem and master the game.\n\nAnyway, probably because of very rigid mechanics, ITB seems to be much less immersive when compared to FTL. It is a good thriller, but I don't feel the threat is that much because if things turn bad I can just abandon the timeline safely to save myself. While in FTL, I felt like i'm one of the crews on the ship that must be protected at all cost. imho, FTL is more organic and immersive than the rigid and forgiving ITB. \n\nminor issues:\nCountering opponents' attacks are the core of this game.  However, in rare cases, it is impossible to counter unknown emerging enemies. In a playthrough, my artilery mech kept safe behind large cluster of mountains got killed by an emerging purple mantis that jump across, ensnare, and oneshot him to death while my other units are on the other side of mountain and cannot move back to help.

It isn't punitively difficult, at least in part because there is no RNG - you have perfect information, and just need to make the right decisions, unless you let the enemy get out of control.\n\nI have two criticisms, but neither are gamebreaking.\n\nFirst, the amount of content seems a bit light. There aren't a massive number of mechs to use, customization options, etc - technically there is huge variety, but you will see an extremely small subset in each playthrough, and the repetition on items seems very high - the 'item pool' does not feel very deep, and there is a fairly limited set of enemies and environments. Hopefully, this will be added to post-release by developers or modders, but this might impact the replay value over the not-too-long term.\n\nSecond, the balance between squads seems very poor. This could be because some are simply intended as more challenging, which is reasonable, but a few of the squads I have unlocked have almost no damage output, leaving them with an extremely 'niche' early game which makes the unable to consistently complete some objectives, and heavily reliant on lucking in to a decent 'drop' or shop item. Other squads seem very well balanced from the start, and need little other than the 'skill point' analog to really come together. This could be a design decision rather than a mistake, but i feel like it is a questionable one.\n\nAll in all, I see myself getting quite a solid amount of play out of this. Turn-based iterative roguelikes I can play in a window while watching things are always nice, and this one is well presented and engaging.

Hier steuern wir Runde f\u00fcr Runde die verschiedenen Einheitentypen und lassen dabei den Feind verbrennen, zerquetschen oder ertrinken. Dabei ist Strategie gefragt, da der Feind in der Regel quantitative und gelegentlich auch qualitative \u00dcberlegenheit besitzt. Au\u00dferdem ist er nicht so angreifbar wie wir \u2013 wir die nebenbei auch noch die letzten verbliebenen Strukturen der Menschheit besch\u00fctzen m\u00fcssen.\n\n [h1] Gameplay: [/h1]\n[b] Gutes: [/b]\n[list]\n[*]Spielmechaniken sind einfach zu erlernen und schwer(er) zu meistern. Es ist m\u00f6glich den Feind direkt anzugreifen, ihn zu entz\u00fcnden, ihn ins Wasser oder gegen die Wand zusto\u00dfen oder auf die n\u00e4chste Kachel zu schupsen. Alles ist in jeder Situation mal sinnvoller, mal weniger sinnvoll. Die Kombination macht es aus und so liegt die Entscheidung \u00fcber Erfolg oder Fehlschlag in der Hand des Spielers.\n[*]In der Regel treten kaum unfaire Situationen auf. Scheitert man, so ist meist eine Fehlentscheidung des Spielers ausschlaggebend. Unterst\u00fctzend kann der Spieler einmalig pro Kampf die Runde neu beginnen und so eine schwere Fehlentscheidung revidieren \u2013 manchmal kann aber selbst das nicht mehr helfen.\n[*]Viele Einheitentypen erfordern verschiedene Strategien.\n[*]Gro\u00dfartiges Gef\u00fchl, wenn man selbst bemerkt, dass der eben ausgef\u00fchrte Zug die eigentlich ausweglose Lage meistern konnte.\n[*]Taktische Tiefe durch viele Items und eigenschaftentragene Piloten.\n[*]Verschiedene Kartenziele, teilweise m\u00fcssen wir einen Damm sprengen, einen Zug begleiten oder einfach nur \u00fcberleben.\n[*] Hoher Widerspielwert. Durch Errungenschaften schalten wir (wie etwa in FTL^^) neue Einheiten mit neuen System frei.\n[/list]\n [b] Schlechtes: [/b]\n [list]\n[*]Insbesondere die ersten 5 Minuten jedes Durchgangs gleichen sich oft deutlich!\n[*]Alle Karten sind wild zusammengew\u00fcrfelte Geb\u00e4udeanordnungen, die jegliche Systematik der Architektur vermissen lassen.\n [/list]\n\n[h1] Technik: [/h1]\n[b] Gutes: [/b]\n[list]\n[*]Stilvolle Grafik.\n [*]Die Systemanforderungen sind gering. \n[*]Nette Soundkulisse.

Allerdings haben wir keine gro\u00dfartige und auszeichnungsw\u00fcrdige Blockbustermusik vor uns, die wir auch gerne im Radio auf dem Weg zur Arbeit h\u00f6ren wollen. F\u00fcr eine 16-bit Indie-Spielmusik allerdings durchaus sch\u00f6n gemacht. \n[/list]\n[b] Schlechtes: [/b]\n [list]\n[*]Kein Grafiksprung seit FTL, stattdessen ein durchschnittlicher Pixellook.\n[*]Die meisten Objekte sind dezent animiert \u2013 allerdings geht da noch mehr.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Fazit: [/h1]\nInto the Breach hat nach Erscheinen einen Hype generiert, der f\u00fcr ein Spiel dieser Art v\u00f6llig \u00fcbertrieben ist. Wer ein Meisterwerk erwartet, dass ihn Packt und auch abseits des Computers begleitet wird wohl entt\u00e4uscht, es handelt sich vielmehr um einen Nachfolger im Geister von FTL. Am Abend einige Runden spielen und dabei sich dank der eigenen taktischen Raffinesse gut f\u00fchlen ist hervorragend m\u00f6glich, allerdings sind Spiele dieser Art in der Regel nicht im Mainstream zuhause, da macht auch Into the Breach keine Ausnahme. L\u00e4sst man sich auf diesen Indiehit ein, kann man sich oftmals stolz auf die Schulter klopfen, da man wieder gro\u00dfes geleistet hat. Das Spielkonzept motiviert immerwieder zu einem neuen Durchlauf, da die hohe Anzahl verschiedener Einheitentypen immer wieder neue Herausforderungen stellen.

You'll need it. :p\n\nInto the Breach truly lives up and rises above my high expectations that were set by the quality standard of FTL (one of my favourite 3 indie titles on Steam).\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\nThe game is mainly a kaiju chess game with the only difference that the enemy AI telegraphs its following moves.\nYour arsenal to counter the alien invaders not only consists of your squad of three mechs (that can be chosen from unlockable squad presets before you start the run) manned by pilots (who are to be levelled up to unlock additional perks), but the enemy itself that can be tricked into destroying each other or themselves and also the 8x8 grid of terrain which can be manipulated and used against them as well.\nThe different units and enemy types create a lot of gameplay variation and every move has to be planned accordingly, because one mistake can end the run quickly and also permanently.\nThe goal is basically to reconquer islands that the aliens invaded. In doing so, you are free to work on additional objectives. If you fail to protect the population and energy sources, you fail the run. If you lose a mech, your pilot dies and is replaced by a (still controllable) robot AI that cannot level up or provide perks anymore. After having freed an island, you can invest your earnings into improving your gear/crew.\n\n[u]Visuals and UI[/u]\nThe aesthetics of the game are - like in FTL - pretty minimalistic, but very appropriate and add a nice \"Battle Isle\"-ish retro feel to the game. Additionally, the player is able to distinguish between the different units easily and isn't distracted by an overload of special effects. The overall design of the grids and the UI offer the exact amount of features that you need, no more or less, and offer the tools for more detailed preplanning of the battle phases and macromanagement as well. This is done way better than in other titles like XCom that unfortunately come with such a high amount of features, that the player is totally on overload sometimes. Minimalism sometimes beats complexity, this is the perfect example of how it's done!\n\n[u]Bottom line[/u]\nI'm pretty sure the game can fill the big footsteps its predecessor carved into stone before.

You just need to unlock a starting mech that posesses it.\nPilots are unique enough, but low diversity of perks they can gain highly impairs that. I had 3 pilots with +3 grid and +1 power during two subsequent playthroughs(5 total, 1 was sent back)\nBattle maps is the weakest part of the game. Thoughenough for 1-2 playthroughs, they begin to repeat way too early. The fact, that most of them can be used in each of 4 tile sets lowers the not-too-high uniqness of each island even more.\nTo sum up, the game is worth what it costs. It provides enough fun and challenge, and its cons are non-existant if you play like a normal person, and don't spend days in it.", "timestamp_created": 1519895540, "timestamp_updated": 1519896303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40482146": {"recommendationid": "40482146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078502880", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520236358}, "language": "english", "review": "I like this game.

Cependant, ce n'est pas le joyau de perfection que beaucoup semble d\u00e9crire, alors malgr\u00e9 mon pouce en l'air, je vais mettre l'accent sur ce qui me parait n\u00e9\u00e9gatif.\n\nLes mechs sont trop long \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer compte tenu de la courtesse (petitesse ?) d'une campagne compl\u00e8te. L'\u00e9nergie demand\u00e9e par module fait qu'on a rarement l'occasion de monter plus de 2-3 modules au total, sauf si on ach\u00e8te toujours les r\u00e9acteurs en fin d'\u00eele pour 3 R\u00e9p, mais alors on ne fait pas mumuse avec les armes et outils \u00e9galement \u00e0 vendre. Je comprends bien l'aspect \"\u00e9chec\" du jeu, mais c'est trop rapidement r\u00e9p\u00e9titif pour justifier que je joue des dizaines de fois juste pour d\u00e9bloquer autre chose pour \u00e0 peine 2-4 heures, et tout reperdre en fin de partie. De fait, on va alors souvent jouer avec les Mechs de base, et seulement quand c'est presque d\u00e9j\u00e0 fini, on va profiter de quelques am\u00e9liorations.\n\nLes pilotes, pareil. Seulement 2 niveaux de progression, et perte \u00e0 la fin d'une campagne, et seulement un pilote \u00e0 choisir alors qu'on a 3 Mechs.\n\nLes \u00eeles ont 4 environnements diff\u00e9rents, mais dans chacun, on retrouve des m\u00e9canismes similaires. Que ce soit la foudre ou la lave ou un effondrement, le r\u00e9sultat est le m\u00eame avec une l\u00e9g\u00e8re variante : destruction de l'unit\u00e9 sur la case, et effet secondaire (feu, trou...).\n\nCertains Mechs sont clairement plus techniques et situationnels, ce qui peut sembler marrant, mais finalement pas efficace.

I could play more mech groups, try to unlock more stuff, but I feel like I've seen most of the game already. It should have more islands or multiple endings. The final boss battle needs more.\n\nPros:\n++Clean gameplay, intuitive but complex. (Very big pro)\n+Priced right, If more games were at this price i would buy more, I'm happy to buy indie titles from subset games at indie prices.\n+Nice art style.\n+I like the soundtrack,\n+Fun and challenging\n\nMixed:\n~Story seems interesting, a bit mysterious, but there needs to be more content\n\nCons:\n-Too short, I feel like I had mostly finished the content after about 4 hours of gameplay. after 7 hours I feel like there's lots of collections i could do or mech customizations i could try, but i dont want to. Needs to have more story, more islands, longer boss battle with choices.\n-No multiplayer, I realize Subset games has never done multiplayer before, but in this day and age i feel like it's important to games (it would also vastly increase sales, but maybe they are concerned with attracting the wrong consumers).

Into the Breach may be right for you.\n\n[h1]Predictable Chess Games[/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is not like chess. In chess, the first moves are not predictable. Your opponent can choose any of the eight pawns to move. After that one move, it gets more and more impossible to predict which moves your opponent can make and it ends up being \"protect the king at all costs.\"\n\nIn ItB, it's nothing like that, at first.\nYour main objective is to protect the buildings. At all costs. Failure to do so multiple times on different maps results in a game over. Thing is, you will know which move the computer controlled Vex will do. Maybe they'll target a building. Maybe they'll target you and your allies. You can stop that by pushing/killing with the mechs at your disposal. You can also move yourself out of the way, take damage to protect a building, or protect your mechs and buildings altogether. Like FTL, there are many, many ways of tackling the situation, except this time you make decisions and very hard ones at worst. \n\nThe RNG of ItB is not the main enemy this time around. You are always able to tip the scales in your favor, through movement of your mechs and the correct place to shoot. Everything can be controlled to benefit your game, even when things seem at their most dire. That doesn't mean all games can be easily flipped. Maybe you will get a round that, no matter what you do, a building will fall. That doesn't mean you can't stop the others from the same faith. It is all about the future, for the greater good, that will linger in your mind. In ItB, you have to think about what you have done and what that means next turn.\n\nWhatever you do will be your fault when you play this game. That's just the beauty of the game: the RNG makes it so you can't easily blame the system if you fail. It's all about the actions you take, and that really makes you feel like a commander.

First of all, the story is good and playing and reading it once is fun, but it doesn't stand up to the repetitiveness of roguelikes, not like FTL's story did.\n\nIt's repetetive and not nearly as random as FTL, and even worse, the objectives on every map are nearly the same. Yeah, here and there you have 1 extra building or some extra units, but compared to FTL's variety this game just doesn't live up to the hype. Every map you just have to defend buildings, plain and simple, you need to play 5 rounds in similiar looking enviroments with little to no changes.\n\nEven having to play with the same loadout twice, to unlock achievements doesn't seem it worth it to me, because after having to play 22 rounds with 1 loadout to win, you know the ins and outs.\n\nThe only fact that makes it worth it, is the achievements and unlocking more squads (you need between 2-6 achievements per squad for that).\n\nYou're basically just either dealing dmg to enemies, dodging their attacks, putting effects on tiles (fire, smoke, ice, acid), pulling/pushing them away from the structures they try to attack, or pushing them into the water (which kills ground units instantly).\n\nAlso the pilot system is kind of meh. You can only level a pilot for 2 levels and then xp becomes irrelevant. Worst thing is that you can kind of get those 2 levels on 1 island and you need to beat between 2-4 islands per run.\n\nThis is a rogue-like game with 4 mission per island and 1 boss battle per island + 2 boss battles in the final battle (which you can attend after 2 islands).\n\nIt is challenging on normal, if you you are a masochist/pro, you can try it on hard difficulty.\n\nI personally dislike that most rewards only matter at the end of islands. This means you have a few missions with nearly identical equipment and loadout, nearly identical enviroment and nearly identical enemies.\n\nThere is also no fast paced or real time component like in FTL.\n\nIf you unlocked all achievements in FTL and loved unlocking every ship (which honestly took way to much time for me),\nthen you will probably love this game.\n\nFor 6 hours of fun, 15 \u20ac is still worth (you pay 8-12\u20ac for a movie these days!!!).\n\nIt just doesn't live up to the hype for me,\nbut I'm simply not a fan of rogue likes (too much wasted time and randomness).\n\nAlso if you don't feel overwhelmed with normal, then don't try to play easy, it will rob you of any fun, even it's way easier to unlock achievements that way.\n\nAlso for the devs:\n\nIt would also be great to choose pilots for all 3 mechs, not just one.\n\nIt would be cool to have more pilot levels.\n\nMaybe more item drops and make the shop not exlusively at the end of an island.\n\nMaybe be able to get more mechs (like more than 3 per round), and then also more enemies for more complex battles.\n\nYou also should not have to choose a pilot to keep at the end of the game, but instead at the start.\n\nThe weapon drops are way to rare.\n\nMaybe I was just unlucky, but most of the time, the dropped weapons were useless. And in like 3-4 games I had only 2 weapon drops, yeah a lot of pilots and random fame/energy/mech energy, but the weapons are the fun stuff. Also most weapons are way to expensive to be useful mech energy wise, so multi weapon loadouts are nonexistant, making the game way to linear.

Though I gave this developer's previous game, FTL, a positive review, I ended up not liking it much.  RNG-overload, you see.  So many elements of that game have little to do with strategy, and everything to do with rolling the dice.  As a huge fan of roguelikes, I\"m used to RNG, but... that game didnt do it very well, at least in my view.  It just wasnt for me, I guess.\n\n\nThis one, however, went in the complete opposite direction.  Into the Breach is a combination of turn-based strategy and roguelike (yes, I\"m going to call it that.  RogueLIKE.  Deal with it.).  This is a combination that, theoretically, has alot of randomness to it.  And indeed, the roguelike-style randomness of each run's \"structure\" and events is certainly there (so is the permadeath).  But it's the combat that makes  this what it is, as the combat will never use RNG against you.  Aim at an enemy with an attack that does 2 damage?  You *will* hit that enemy for 2 damage.  There are some exceptions to this (such as buildings having a certain chance to not take damage), but for the most part, once you're in a battle, RNG is *not* going to be what kills you (unlike a game such as XCOM, or FTL itself).  Your own mistakes and bad planning is what will do that.\n\nAnd the game gives you plenty of opportunity to plan and strategize.  One of the defining features is how the game handles enemy attacks.  Enemies always attack first, and THEN move.  On your turn, you will see exactly what type of attack or ability each enemy is going to use when their turn starts, and exactly what effects it'll have, where it'll hit, and how much damage it will do.  All of this will be brightly marked so you cant miss it.  The game gives you all the info you could conceivably need in order to puzzle out a solution to deal with each situation that it'll create.\n\nAnd \"puzzle\" is the key word here.  Individual battles are short, but every single turn will have you faced with some sort of daunting situation, and your job will be to take the various screwy abilities your squad of 3 mechs has, and come up with a way to use and combine them to put a stop to the enemy's plans.  It's not as simple as just protecting yourself though.  Your real goal is to protect all the innocent citizens that live in the many, many buildings on each map.  If a building goes down, your power-grid meter drops.  If that runs out, it's game over for you, and that meter is persistent throughout the entire run.  Wheras your HP refills completely after every battle.  Since every mission lasts a specific number of turns (usually 4 or 5, and battles dont end until the turn count expires, with more monsters spawning every turn), your actual goal isnt \"kill everything\".  Instead, it is simply to thwart the enemy in any way.  Many of those methods wont even involve doing damage.\n\nAnd this is part of the brilliance of the game.  Your mechs have all sorts of abilities that they can use (and you'll be able to pick up more over the course of each run).  They can dish out damage, sure, but what's more important is all the OTHER things they can do.  An artillery unit, for instance, can fire an arcing mortar shot.  When this impacts, the tile it's on takes 1 damage, which isnt much, but the true strength of this move comes from the fact that any movable object on adjacent tiles will be forcibly shoved away.  Is a powerful enemy about to blow the funky crap out of a line of buildings?  Instead of slightly annoying it with a direct mortar shot, land it next to the monster, and simply shove it out of position, so that when it attacks, it whiffs, hitting empty tiles instead.  Most attacks that you can use have something they do beyond JUST damage.  A punch attack for instance might do damage, but then shove your target forward one tile.  Every single mech you have, whatever weaponry they're using, they're going to have some real versatility in terms of how you use their skills to deal with the enemy.\n\nThose mechs also have alot of variety to them.  Firstly, you have a bunch of different mech squads you can unlock, each working very differently from the last. On your first run, you'll be using a fairly basic team, good at easy to understand traditional sorts of attacks (but with lots of added versatility).  You'll be doing things like punching stuff, using the artillery shot, and fairly basic things like that, to damage/shove/whatever the enemy.  But other squads will be very different.  In my second run, I went with the Zenith squad, which plays nothing like the default guys.  I've got one mech that's a very heavy hitter... but is also a master of collateral damage, which can be a very bad thing here.  The second can use a dashing attack to deal a good solid hit (and this also shoves the target), but it damages itself every time it moves, which makes it hard to use as it only has 3 HP to start with.  And then the third one has trouble doing any damage at all.  It has a bizarre ranged bolt that does no damage, but simply pulls a target one tile towards it, and this powerful but limited shielding move.  It's possible to do damage with this guy by pulling on an enemy that's standing right next to it (it causes the two to collide, dealing 1 damage to both) but that's terribly risky and hard to make use of.   So this squad is just way more screwy than the one I had started with.  Yet despite this, they are every bit as capable, and just as satisfying to use.\n\nOn top of that, you're going to be able to upgrade these guys over the course of any run.  You can improve equipment, level-up your pilots, and buy all sorts of modules and such at the between-island shops.  Any weapon you have equipped can be replaced by a different module, so you can drastically change things up if you see a good reason to.  Any module can go onto any mech, but some will require additional power as a penalty if they're not on the correct \"class\" of mech.  Overall, I think the upgrade and customization mechanics are fantastic here, adding even more depth to an already deep game, and making it so that each run's progression feels satisfying and rewarding.\n\nAnd there's so much more to it than just that.  All sorts of unique enemy designs, special units that may appear in certain missions, different side-goals that give you bonuses if you complete them, and all sorts of other features.\n\nIt's important to note though that like FTL (and most games that are at all procedural) this WILL be repetitive in alot of ways.  There's no avoiding that.  Of course, if you play alot of roguelikes or other sorts of procedural games, you probably arent going to be bothered by this.  And in my opinion, the game is fantastic at changing things up.  I had heard of players that were in testing for this one, and were getting a couple hundred hours out of it, and I can totally see that.  If this game suits you, you will probably find yourself coming back to it over and over.\n\nNote also though that the difficulty is VERY subjective.  Some players have been getting wrecked... others cleared a run on their very first try.  Of course, a game like this isnt just about clearing ONE run, but if you're the sort that tends to lose interest after your first win, this may not be for you.  The game does have a scoring system, so trying to win WELL is a major goal here too.\n\nThere's so much more I could ramble about, but I've made my point.  I play ALOT of games with a high emphasis on strategy and tactics.  But I have a very hard time thinking of any that I like more than this one.  Absolutely recommended.\n\nAnd I see Steam is being an embarrassment again.  I wish they'd fix this review-posting bug.  But then, they dont like fixing stuff much, do they?  Sigh...  That's a whole other rant though.

While FTL had a great deal of RNG that you had to dodge around, most of that from ITB is just enemy spawns and behavior (as well as the chance for buildings to resist damage). Every battle is very much like a puzzle. You'll find yourself baffled at a particular scenario, thinking the game has screwed you, and a few minutes later you'll be patting yourself on the back for finding a creative solution for minimizing damage. That's fun and a solid core that the game is built around, and my hat's off to the developer for making such a balanced and rather excellent combat system. There are even a fair variety of mission types (though to be fair most of them devolve into some variation of \"kill a thing,\" \"defend a thing,\" or \"survive.\").\n\nUnfortunately, everything else around it is just okay. The story is set up really well, but doesn't really go anywhere from there. The game, while very mentally engaging, isn't nearly as difficult as FTL, which is actually something of a problem for a Roguelike, where part of the addictive quality is supposed to come from ramming your head against the brick wall until you break through. In FTL, is was probably more than ten hours before I secured my first win after over a dozen failures and experiments with different ships, parts, upgrades, and crews. In ITB I beat my very first run on Normal difficulty using the base gear, the default team, and few additional weapons. It wasn't a blowout victory; I won with only a hit point or two left, but that's not the point. I should be hitting the \"scraping by via the skin of your teeth\" stage somewhere around hour 12, not hour 2.\n\nUnlocks in ITB are tied to your achievements. Each one grants you a coin, and those coins are used to buy new mech teams. Those teams also each come with a color pallet that can be applied to mechs from any other team, and you can create a custom team using mechs from any unlocked team. While this is fine, I much preferred the story-based unlocks in FTL. Stumbling across a quest that unlocked a new ship was exhilerating, and that just isn't here. FTL had some progression based on achievements, but not all of it, and I think that balance was important (though to be fair it does seem like Pilots need to be unlocked some other way, but I'm not sure exactly how to do that without FTL's narrative layer).\n\nSpeaking of the narrative layer, that's almost completely stripped out in ITB. Running across interesting scenarios like pirates attacking a commerce ship, a station infected by a virus, or similar scenarios was what really tied FTL together. The fact that you could use that layer to take risks and find new scrap, weapons, or crew was what really made the game as juicy and addicting as it was. Not only is that not here, but there also seems to be something of a variety problem. In FTL, there were tons of different system arranged in new and interesting ways each time you play. This time, there are four islands arranged in the same order (Read: Whatever order you want) and with the same layout every time you go to that island. There's also a fifth island, but that one's just a final boss scenario (which, by the way, isn't nearly as intereting as FTL's final boss of the Rebel Flagship. Here it's just two normal back-to-back missions, the final of which has a normal boss in it).\n\nYou have the option to complete anywhere from 2 to 4 islands before approaching the final boss. You'd assume that going the distance is a risk vs. reward scenario where you need to press your luck in later islands to get the better gear you need to tackle the final mission. Or that you're taking a huge risk by attacking the final mission early without weakening the forces on the other islands. However, that just isn't the case. The game flat-out tells you that the final mission will scale to your strength. Which begs the question of what even is the point is to letting players choose how many islands they want to fight? The only real decision you're making at that point is how \"long\" you want your game to be, but that hardly matters when you can just save and quit whenever you want.\n\nI'll also mention that progression in this game (within an individual game) isn't nearly as fun as in FTL. In FTL, finding scrap is always fun and will have you constantly on the lookout for shops to spend it at, if you're not already dumping it into ship upgrades. There are tons of different ships with tons of different ways to upgrade them, lots of crew to man them, and lots of different ways to fight with your ship. While that exists with the mechs and you'd assume the lack of complexity with each mech is made up for by the fact that there are three mechs instead of one ship... it really isn't. Upgrading your mech seldom feels as good as upgrading your ship, and frequently you'll find yourself passing up entire stores worth of weapons because at the end of the day, most aren't worth it. You'll need a ton of Cores to make them work, and frequently just upgrading your primary tools are going to be far more effective anyways.\n\nReally, at the end of the day, Into the Breach just makes me want to play more FTL. By no means does this mean I think that Into the Breach is bad, but it does mean that it looks best without comparing it to FTL. You'll have fun diving Into the Breach, but you'll find yourself coming up for air a lot sooner than you'd think.\n\nI give Into the Breach a 3 out of 5.", "timestamp_created": 1519871989, "timestamp_updated": 1519871989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705691", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40476643": {"recommendationid": "40476643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056808379", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520127157}, "language": "english", "review": "Its look amazing simple but its very deep strategy.

FTL is one of my favourite games of the last 10 years, and so I was always going to buy this game on release. The music is again by Ben Prunty, which can only ever be a plus point for a game.\n\nIf you've played FTL, then you probably have a fair idea of what to expect already. This follows on in the same vein, where you're battling enemies as well as RNG; and while losing is inevitable and can be frustrating, every death gives you an insight into what you did wrong and what you can do better next time.\n\nDespite many similarities to FTL, Into the Breach is still definitely its own game. There is far less in the way of procedural storytelling than FTL - this game is far more rooted on the strategic combat side of things.\n\nUsing a small squad of mechs, each with their own weapons and abilities, you are tasked with deploying them to a small map and defending the buildings in that region until the turn counter runs out, at which point the enemy retreats. At the beginning of each turn, all the enemy units' attacks are telegraphed, so you know what is going to happen as soon as you hit the \"end turn\" button. You can inspect enemies to find out how each of their attacks works.\n\nAnd therein lies the main strategic element of the game. While it is usually beneficial to kill as many of the enemies as possible (as is the case in most turn-based strategy games like Final Fantasy Tactics or XCOM), sometimes it is preferable to use your attacks to knock the enemies around the map, forcing them to miss their attacks, or even hit their own units. You can push enemies into the water or off the map, killing them instantly, knock them into mountains or each other, or simply move them away from what they were trying to attack.\n\nAs the campaign goes on, you are introduced to many other features that will affect the way you play each map. Sometimes, an earthquake or tidal wave causes the edge of the map to disappear each turn, instantly killing any unit that ends the turn in that area (unless the enemy can fly, of course). Sometimes, random areas of the map are bombarded by air strikes each turn. Like FTL, there are several different systems in place within the game, all of which interact with each other to create a feeling of emergent, varied gameplay.\n\nEach map has its own objectives (e.g. protect a certain building, or kill a certain number of enemy units, or take less than a certain amount of damage). Maps are small enough that each battle plays out in around 8-10 minutes, but a campaign can go for an hour or longer if you continue to be successful. As you progress, units can be leveled up and equipped with new weapons to give them greater tactical use. There is a real feeling of progression as you complete maps and improve your mechs.\n\nThe game's interface manages to communicate a lot of information very effectively (as was the case with FTL), and complement the mechanics of the game very well. There is definitely a feeling of satisfaction when completing a map without taking damage.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game to anybody who enjoyed FTL, or anyone who enjoys turn-based strategy games.", "timestamp_created": 1519871662, "timestamp_updated": 1519871662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40476538": {"recommendationid": "40476538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064196489", "num_games_owned": 460, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 307, "last_played": 1520903055}, "language": "english", "review": "imagine if pacific rim got a chess game adaption", "timestamp_created": 1519871451, "timestamp_updated": 1519871451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646162", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40476417": {"recommendationid": "40476417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004697919", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 125, "last_played": 1521076345}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1519870840, "timestamp_updated": 1519870840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40476396": {"recommendationid": "40476396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086780899", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 162, "last_played": 1521126589}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game, with a little twist each time you pick a new squad.

At the point of writing this review, I have played one run. The first problem is that run took 3 hours. That's fine because they let you beat the game with less islands if you choose. However, the real problem is that I won my first run. Going in, I knew next to nothing about this game, and I expected it would probably take a few runs to get good enough to even attempt to win. Then I won my only run clearing all four islands, with little to no difficulty.

When I first looked at the screenshots, I was a bit disappointed. I loved the space ship mechanics of FTL, and this seemed to be not nearly as fun.\n\n[i]How wrong I was.[/i]\n\nInto The Breach is a very different game, but it is obvious it was made by the same people. There is a [b]lot[/b] of strategic depth in this game, arguably more than FTL ever had. \n\nSo, what is this game?\nThe earth is being overwhelmed by alien insects, called the Vek. You have a team of 3 mechs and their pilots to your disposal. Each mech has unique abilities, which makes fighting the Vex a very fun, challenging puzzle. Each turn, you have to figure out how to get the most out of your 3 dudes. \nOf course, missions become progressively more difficult and you will gain upgrades to your mechs (and levels on your pilots). You will face new, unknown alien threats each time you progress to the next island (ie. the next map).\n\nIf you fail and/or die, you get the oppertunity to send 1 single pilot back into the past in a last ditch effort to free Earth of the Vek. This mechanic is amazing.  Not only does this make starting over again less painful (you still have a trusty pilot at your side), it also allows you to try different things! \nOn top of that, the 3 mechs you start with, are just 1 of the 8 squads available in the game! That is a total of 24 unique mechs (possibly more if there are some hidden mechs, which wouldn't surprise me). \n\nThe replay value of this game is amazing, especially for this price.

Es bring f\u00fcr mich neuen Wind in dieses rundenbasierte Strategiespiel. Vor allem, da es reines PvE ist, hat man so das Gef\u00fchl, mehr Kontrolle zu haben. \nDurch die Anzeige, welche Felder angegriffen werden, steht man nicht so bl\u00f6d da, wenn pl\u00f6tzlich mehrere Gegner ihr Angriffsmuster wechseln m\u00f6chten und versuchen einen einzelnen eigenen Charakter anzugreifen. \n\nHier kann man stattdessen anst\u00e4ndig Planen und sich entscheiden, welche Missionsziele f\u00fcr einen wichtiger sind. Blockt man ein Geb\u00e4ude mit dem eigenen Mech und bringt damit den Piloten in Gefahr? Opfert man vielleicht ein paar Geb\u00e4ude um die Bonusziele zu erf\u00fcllen und sich damit Belohnungen zu sichern?

It's different than say X-Com or Atlas Reactor. In X-Com you move and attack, they move and attack with chance to hit being % based. In Atlas Reactor is synchronous turn based where each side selects their moves based on what they see and then everything plays out at once. \n\nIn this you start off by seeing where the enemy units are and then place your units where you want, but it is limited to a starting zone. Then the enemy will move their units and decide where to attack, once this is completed the enemies attack will always happen in this direction. Say a melee unit moves to your tank and attacks to the left (to hit the tank) or a range unit is aiming north. These attacks will happen at the end of your turn in a predetermined order that you will see ahead of time. In this aspect it is closer to a puzzle more than a typical turn based game, but does a great job of mixing them together with a lot of RPG elements / char building as well.\n\nBack to the enemy attacks... You use your attacks / CC to destroy the enemy. Often you will need to use strategic movement of the enemy units and most of your attacks will move them in certain directions. You need to think ahead and move the enemy about to hit your tank into the same row as another enemy who attacks after the first one so it will kill the other enemy unit. It's very fun and so far feels fairly challenging.

The game has a lot of replayability. Just like FTL, but instead of ships, you have plenty of mech teams to unlock and play around with. Eight of them to be exact. Alongside this there's over fifty achievements, squad customization (colors, names and what you bring).

Betas and whatnot combined, I have put several hundred hours into FTL, and would easily rank it as one of my all time favourite games. With that in mind, Into the Breach is not FTL. Although similar philosophies are present and it's clear that the same guys made both games, Into the Breach is very much its own game, and an amazing one at that.\n\nWhereas FTL was a roguelite/role playing game/space trip, Into the Breach is a deterministic turn based strategy game, which is played on 8x8 grids. A squad of three time-traveling mechs takes on invading giant bugs in an effort to save humanity from the disaster which wiped them out in the mechs' original timeline. I like many things about Into the Breach, from its slight roguelite twists -- you unlock new pilots, new mechs and new abilities from run to run, and all the missions are slightly randomized -- to the little touches, like people shouting encouragement at your mechs from the buildings you're trying to save.\n\nBut what really elevates Into the Breach is the deterministic nature. The word might sound strange, but what it means is there's practically no RNG in the game. On your turns you can see what the enemies will do when they get their chance, and that is 100% what they will do. Attacks won't miss, armour won't save anyone, and the percentages are never against you, or for you. They don't exist. Instead, every turn presents itself as a small puzzle where the player tries to chain together their mechs' different attacks to manipulate and maneuver the bugs around. Let's have a small example.\n\nOn your turn it looks like one bug is about to unleash a massive flame attack which will burn everything in its path. The attack is originally aimed at one of your mechs, and several buildings behind it. If these buildings get destroyed, your power meter runs out and you lose the game. Not to worry! One robot goes around the bug and punches it, shoving it one square to the right. Now the attack is going to miss its original targets and instead splash some mountains. But why stop there? With your other two mechs you can damage some of the other bugs around, and to add insult to injury, push them into the flame attack's path. End the turn, and sure enough: two bugs are now burnt to a crisp and one is looking awfully embarrassed.\n\nInto the Breach might sound like a very simple game, and in a way it is. The mechanics are immediately obvious, the game does a wonderful job of presenting the player with all the information they could need -- in as big or small doses as they desire -- and the game never feels unfair. Despite this, Into the Breach is extremely hard. The objectives in each mission mean you're rarely just getting away with killing as many bugs as you can, but instead have to constantly rethink your strategies depending on what you're asked to do. The enemies are ruthless and will exploit any mistakes you make. The margins are thin and one badly executed turn can send you into a spiral which will inevitably end in a loss. You will try, fail and try again.\n\nIf you're like me, as you try and try again, you're having a blast. Into the Breach is an amazingly fun and well playing game with a gorgeous low res look, a great soundtrack by Ben Prunty and all the attention to detail you'd expect from the guys who made FTL. Add in hefty amounts of replay value and a very customer friendly price point, and you've got one hell of a game. \n\nBuy it!\n", "timestamp_created": 1519853286, "timestamp_updated": 1519853286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40471799": {"recommendationid": "40471799", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983864726", "num_games_owned": 391, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 3198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 226, "last_played": 1520620255}, "language": "english", "review": "I played FTL and I thought \"No way this could be as good as FTL.\"\n\nIt might be.

So my review is based on no predetermined expectations of anything really other than what I saw on PC Gamer announcing this game \n\nThis game might look simple but it's not. I have seen reviews of people saying \"its too easy\". Well I don't know what planet they live on but it's not \"easy\". Perhaps they were playing it on \"easy\" difficuly, I'm certainly not. Most of my life I have been playing games like this and completed most of them on the most difficult settings possible but this game just takes the piss. \n\nOk, there is a sense of you can still win each level quite easily but if you want perfection, absolute perfection, then it is not easy and that is why I do not find this game easy. \n\nThe gameplay itself is great. It's a typical turn based strategy game except to win you basically have to survive a number of turns to win. That's not all though because you have to not only survive but also accomplish objectives while doing so or you wil lose out on things later.  You can also still do the bare minimum to win but it may not favour you as time goes on. \n\nThe graphics, well they're shocking aren't they really compared to today's normal standards, but I love it. I don't care for super graphics in a game if the game stands out to me as something I just want to play because it looks cool. I'll still go back to some old games now regardless of whether I spend \u00a32k on a new rig just 3 months ago. #\n\nFrom what I can see and considering it's the 50th or so time I've restarted this game in the hope for perfection it seems completely random. I.e. I don't seem to have had the same landscape or map twice in a row. In other words, trying to learn a decent tactic for one specific mission isnt going to happen, it'll be different every time. I still have much to learn. \n\nSo take it as you will. It seems you're either a fanboi for playing FTL or a complete noob, or some random expert who doesn't mind letting buildings explode but completed it already. I know which one I am. I'll be here for a looong time. \n", "timestamp_created": 1519851942, "timestamp_updated": 1519851942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40471200": {"recommendationid": "40471200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045509298", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 335, "last_played": 1520906794}, "language": "english", "review": "Bite-sized chess+xcom with a touch of FTL.", "timestamp_created": 1519851429, "timestamp_updated": 1519851429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40471152": {"recommendationid": "40471152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028091020", "num_games_owned": 3051, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 1703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 142, "last_played": 1520901220}, "language": "english", "review": "Into the Breach is a hard and addicting strategy game by the devs that brought us FTL.\n\n[h1] Video Review [/h1]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU02D3zC21k\n\n[h1] Written Review [/h1]\nYou play as a squad of time-travelers tasked with the mission to stop humanity's demise. Earth is being attacked by giant alien bug creatures, and you pilot mechs to combat them.\n\nThe main gameplay objective is to maintain your \"Power Grid\" health. Bugs will constantly target buildings. Each successful hit will drain your Power Grid by one bar. Once it gets to zero, it's game over, and you will get very few chances to regenerate those bars throughout your playthrough, so it's very important to protect your buildings.\n\nThis forces you to play in very clever ways, sometimes even placing your mechs in front of projectiles to protect buildings from getting hit, since they will heal after every battle anyway.\n\nThe gameplay is turn-based. For every round, bugs will set up their attacks. Then it's your turn. All enemy attacks are telegraphed, and the game will show you exactly where all projectiles and such will land, allowing you to properly plan. You have infinite time to make your decision, which is good because you'll really need it.\n\nA mechanic I find very interesting is that a lot of your attacks do not simply damage enemies, but also push them. This way, if a bug is about to attack a building, you can simply get a good angle and push them out of the way of the building. They will follow through with their previously planned attack, however it will be wherever you pushed them to, instead.\n\nThis allows you to sometimes get enemies to attack each other.\n\nThe game does a good job at keeping the game fresh, as well as multiple playthroughs. This is because the levels are randomly generated, and the enemies are varied. \n\nEach level will have optional missions that you definitely want to try accomplish, because you will need them to help your playthrough last. You'll be able to heal your power grid, or purchase upgrades for your mech depending on the optional mission.\n\nEnemies also have unique skills, and behave differently with the environment, which keeps you on your toes.\n\nThere are a lot of small details that allow you to really plan your moves nicely. Such as special tiles like a forest, which if attacked will cause it to ignite. If any one steps on it will then catch fire. Your attacks can also throw enemies onto their friends, causing them to both be damaged.\n\nIf you fail your playthrough, the planet will be overrun by bugs and you are given the choice to choose one of your mech pilots to save. This will transport them back to the future, and then back again to the past on your next playthrough. This allows you to really make them powerful over playthroughs, however it's also more horrible if you get them killed.\n\nOverall, although I've explained the basics, there are so many fun aspects to this game that can't properly be explained through text, so if you're interested I'd invite you to watch my video review at the top. \n\nIt's a great game, that really captures that simple-to-learn-but-hard-to-master fun that FTL had.

After my fourth victory I was tired of the game. Thankfully [spoiler]the dev left cheats in so I only had to tediously spam the kill command for several more hours to find out that the secret squad wasn't worth the time[/spoiler]. Blegh. I need a shower. Mind ya the rest of the review still sticks and I do still recommend the game albeit much more cautiously.\n\nLets just get this out of the way: Very little content. That's the biggest problem with the game.\n\nI am squarely 'meh' on this game with it being recommended solely because of how unique it is and I would like to see more.\n\nI find this game to be exceptionally unique and for that I can't not recommend it. It's so different than other games and lands directly on satisfaction for finding the right combinations to kill enemies properly. Now with that said, it's a bit too simple/easy and is lacking in content and the ending is piss poor.\n\nI read somewhere someone said this game looks like a flash game and at first I didn't agree. After playing for a while I'm starting to think I get what he was going for when he said that, and even though I still think he was wrong, I get it. The problem I see is that there are very few animations. I would even go so far as to say that the enemy and mech animations are too sparse. They don't even turn to face different directions let alone animate attacks. This doesn't seem like much at first until you use like the lightning whip mech. You expect it to do some fancy shit and it just moves forward slightly and then lightning comes out. I think the best thing to compare this to is like final fantasy tactics how when your guy swings, you see him reel back and then lean forward and swing but the weapon he's holding is a sprite that can be changed.\n\nI think what I'm getting at is that I think the animations are lazy. Really a lot of the game art is lazy and formulaic and you can see this in the enemies who all face one direction (down left) while your guys face the other (down right). I think this is done to let you identify enemies easy (I guess?) but there's no point since your guys are very, VERY obvious and there are so few so if you lose them on the battlefield then that's your bad. I feel like this game would have benefitted from at least different directions for enemies. Was the budget really so thin for art or was this a design choice? Should have spent less on oldy mc old bitches face and more on animations.\n\nThe meat of the game itself is outstanding in terms of raw gameplay. I hate to sound fucking obnoxious but I would go so far as to say 'thought provoking' because really it's a pretty solid take on RNG puzzles. I will say that the levels themselves are just variants of several layouts which means you'll eventually start running into the same layout and it won't be so fun. I actually had this happen back to back with two levels in a row and I was like 'well at least it's this easy as fuck level'. Also I would very much say that the game is too easy. FAR too easy. But not too easy in saying the enemies are too easy to kill, but too easy as in the difficulty curve doesn't go high enough. You reach pinnacle skill level very quickly and all that's left is the burden of knowledge which you won't take too much longer to learn about all the creatures and tile based mechanics.\n\nThe music is largely forgetable. Sorry but this music is not FTL tier music. It fits, but it's pretty mediocre. I think that's a pretty good theme for most of the game aesthetics. It's all meh. I mean don't get me wrong, I fucking love mechs and I think that's cool, but it's all very...low effort.\n\nStory for this game is ok. I find the ending to be very disappointing, but the presentation for it is done well. Instead of hitting you with a text wall you learn little bits here and there through dialogue. Usually I abhor games that use time travel as a plot device (WoW and FFXIV are good examples), but when it's the main theme of the game I like it (Ghost trick, The sexy brutale). It works for this game, but does NOT have a satisfying ending like the two afformentioned games, but at least it doesn't ruin any credibility the game has by having it in it because it's a core aspect of the game. With that said, I'm upset there aren't more time travel like weapons/abilities (unless I haven't found them). A game about time travel with few/no time travel weapons. Like maybe one that pushes an enemy back into the ground but 1 time use would be good.\n\nVariety is the spice of life and this game fails to have enough variety and content. Four islands with a final area just isn't enough, but I'm still going to recommend this game because of how unique it is and because of it's core gameplay being as enjoyable as it is. The devs are known for being good about updates so who knows, maybe more content is on the way, but I don't give points for liking the game devs either sorry.

a great game with very polished core mechanics. but its a little too easy, bland and short.  not sure if its worth $15 at the current state.\n\nyou can beat Into the Breach on normal within an hour, while it took me more than 10 attempts and multiple hours to beat FTL on easy for the first time.\nthe combat feels a little too simplistic, this is more like a puzzle game than a strategy game\n\n- the soundtrack is, as i expected, fantastic. Actually the composer is the No.1 reason why I decided to buy this game. I bought the original soundtrack as soon as it came out and i recommend it. (though id say FTL did a better job even at music, it used adaptive music. the background music in FTL changes in response to the situation)\n\n- the ending is extremely underwhelming, no challenge or no big final boss. the enemies in the final stage are composed of the same enemies youve already seen in the previous stages except in different colors.\n\n- you get to choose how many islands to complete in this game, but the enemies on the final level get stronger if you complete more islands and theres really no point in doing it\n\n- 3% Grid DEF upgrade is extremely useless. i cant believe this useless of an ability is actually in the game and theres no way to stop pilots from getting it\n\nI like the game, but the length and difficulty of the game makes me hesitant to recommend the game. maybe wait till it goes on sale\n\nEDIT: just completed it on hard. there was little to no room for actual thinking, the best option is almost always obvious\n\n--japanese review in progress--\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u57f7\u7b46\u4e2d\n\ntl;dr \u3053\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u597d\u304d\u3060\u3057\u3001\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306f\u3059\u3054\u304f\u6d17\u7df4\u3055\u308c\u3066\u308b\u3057\u3088\u304f\u3067\u304d\u3066\u308b\u6226\u7565\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3060\u3051\u3069\u3042\u307e\u308a\u306b\u3082\u7c21\u5358\u3001\u77ed\u3059\u304e\u308b\u306e\u30671500\u5186\u306e\u4fa1\u5024\u304c\u3042\u308b\u304b\u306f\u602a\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\nFTL\u306feasy\u3067\u3082\u4f55\u5ea6\u3082\u3001\u6570\u6642\u9593\u3082\u304b\u304b\u3063\u305f\u306e\u306b\u3053\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0normal\u3067\u30821\u6642\u9593\u3082\u304b\u304b\u3089\u305a\u306b\u3059\u3050\u306b\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\n\u3061\u306a\u307f\u306b\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u306f\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u6e08\u307f\u3067\u3059\u3001\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u305d\u3093\u306a\u306b\u96e3\u3057\u304f\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3059\n\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u8981\u7d20\u3082\u5c11\u306a\u3044\u3057\u3001\u30ed\u30fc\u30b0\u30e9\u30a4\u30af\u3063\u3066\u3044\u3046\u3088\u308a\u3001\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u4f5c\u6210\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u611f\u3058\u304c\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\n\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081/\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u306e\u4e2d\u9593\u306e\u9078\u629e\u80a2\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3089\u3088\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3093\u3067\u3059\u304c", "timestamp_created": 1519847088, "timestamp_updated": 1520631782, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538853", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40469554": {"recommendationid": "40469554", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993205533", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 188, "last_played": 1520653223}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like chess, except you only got three pieces and your opponent is a little sh*t who won't stop dumping pieces on the board and throwing all your sh*t against the walls while screeching at the top of his lungs, and the horror only ends when he feels bored and decides to leave", "timestamp_created": 1519846892, "timestamp_updated": 1519846892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 78, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706376", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40469485": {"recommendationid": "40469485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003609296", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519775548}, "language": "english", "review": "I love puzzle games, strategy games and time travelling.

If I had to make an analogy I would say FTL is like WarCraft 3 while ITB is like HearthStone. \n\nFTL had more emphasis on a strategic plan; such as taking steps to acquire and manage resources, crew, rooms, equipment and planning an optimal path. ITB focuses instead on a deeper tactical game. The tools and mechs you start with is often sufficient for victory - there's not as much critical decision making involved when playing ITB at a strategic level. \n\nITB focuses instead on a series of tense levels where you'll try to meet tactical goals by rearranging and removing pieces from the board. Since enemes telegraph their actions on your turn you will immediately know how your decisions pan out. \n\nThere is no XCOM style RNG to mitigate - in fact, the only RNG elements are benificial ones, first there is a percentage chance of your buildings shrugging off a hit and second are your rewards from time pods and the shop. This ingenious design takes away the frustrating and sometimes unfair element from other turn-based tactical games but the result is that this becomes an easier (but more fair) game. \n\nIf something goes wrong, it's because of your choices and not RNGesus.\n\nThis game has the charm, fun and replayability of FTL but with a different focus.

Battles are earned through taking the time to plan your attacks and adapting to the ever persistant enemy. It becomes so engrained that when you do get that odd easy map win, it feels a little hollow so you push for a harder map on the next turn. Campaigns are trying but the Roguelike aspects aren't overly defeating. You can lose a campaign with a poor map or two but the desire to simply pick up and start again is ever present. It's easier to quit something like Civ where even small victories are drawn out over time, but this is harder because the victories are every turn you're still alive.\n\nNegative:\nWhile I really enjoy this game, tying squad unlocks to achievement progress is silly in my opinion. I'm sure some people will enjoy it but I can't be the only one who doesn't want to play throw-away campaigns with units we don't want to play with simply so I can get \"12 electric cloud damage in a round\" or \"have five enemies on fire simultaneously\" just so I can get that one or two extra coins to get the next squad.

I played for about 7 hours straight and I didn't even realize it. I sat for minutes at a time thinking about different moves thinking there's no way to make it wihout either losing a mech or civilians. Absolutely love the puzzle solving, especially the emphasis on moving the enemy around rather than killing them.\nFor customization the game has some simple tech trees, abilities, pilots, and weapons to swap between mechs and it works to keep it from getting boring with repeat playthroughs.

I had high expectations of it, which were blown away.\n\nInto the Breach is a tactical turn-based game that's all about positioning. That's why you have mechanics that are all about movement, pushing/pulling enemies, AoE etc. It all flows nicely and it creates an interesting puzzle at every turn. It's satisfying to stare at a difficult situation for several minutes, followed by figuring out a flawless sequence of moves. The game pulls that off constantly, which is insane considering its levels are procedurally generated! To complement all of that, the game has really clean and clear UI (keyboard shortcuts included), a variety of mechs with accompanying toolkit and a solid soundtrack.\n\nBefore release I've read that Into the Breach wasn't going to be as difficult as FTL. I was skeptical at first, but that was dispelled after playing. Think where the replay value comes from FTL: from the fact that it's difficult to beat (as a new player), or from the fact that you can now beat it with another ship you've unlocked, get more achievements, unlock more stuff and so on. Into the Breach embraces the latter, even allowing completely custom squads. It just works so well.\n\nI have to commend the devs for making something on par with their previous monster success of a release, if not better.

Not just protecting civilians and \"Grid\", the overall sort of HP, but sometimes choosing to sacrifice those for the sake of bonus tasks that might reward you something better, or the other way around and more!

Yes, it's a bit like chess + advance wars + FF Tactics + XCOM... , but I think that focusing on game mechanic fails to capture the vision behind why FTL and now ITB are so unique.  What I found fascinating about ITB is the number of times that I though I was screwed, but for some reason managed to pull it out of the hat.  This same capability to think your way out of a problem does not hold as true for FTL, which when things go bad, things go really bad.  If I had to summarize the difference between the two, I would say that ITB hews even closer to the spirit of a rogue based games than FTL.   As such, if analogies give you a better idea of how the game plays, ITB is similar (though not likely equal) to Nethack.   Yes, THE grand-daddiest of all rogue type games, where there's always a solution for fighting off the ants, and winning (aka Ascending) is like getting a Ph.D in gaming.  So yes, worth buying at full price and definitely a winner on discount.   Oh, in regards to the soundtrack, Ben Prunty scoring of FTL was a particularly high bar to beat, given that after a long session of FTL, I sometimes find myself humming the soundtrack 2-3 days later.  ITB's soundtrack was good in that I didn't turn it off, which I normally always do, but I don't remember anything particularly memorable.  Obviously, as I play more perhaps the catchiness will catch me, but as I said it's hard to beat the FTL soundtrack.", "timestamp_created": 1519834667, "timestamp_updated": 1519835161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40464633": {"recommendationid": "40464633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053877292", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 142, "last_played": 1520793251}, "language": "english", "review": "Another great hit from Subset Games.", "timestamp_created": 1519834067, "timestamp_updated": 1519834067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40464560": {"recommendationid": "40464560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043436778", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1520705382}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than FTL.

This game plays wonderfully, and is very addicting. [i]Do I personally like it more than [/i]FTL[i]?[/i] Not really, and that's fine and shouldn't turn anybody off.

With the bar set so high, one would think that conceiving a better game would prove impossible. Yet, Into the Breach accomplishes this incredible feat with ease. Where FTL's flaws lay within its brutally difficult RNG system, Into the Breach successfully corrects this by implementing a system that strongly encourages creative problem solving.\n\nThis was the first release on Steam that a eagerly awaited, and Subset failed to disappoint my anticipation. The game proves tough, but fair. If you lose a pilot, let a city fall, fail an objective, or lose the game, all the blame lies on you. Just as FTL did, this game preys on our inherent ambition, pushing us to better ourselves every run.\n\nThe aesthetics of the game greatly add to one's experience, with a soundtrack that transports the player to an apocalyptic wasteland. The minimalist artstyle proves incredibly effective with this genre, allowing the player to focus on gameplay rather than graphics.\n\nSubset crafted the combat system incredibly methodically, allowing the player to have myriad ways to overcome a threat. One can beat the game purely off of direct attacks, or you may choose a more manipulative strategy, forcing enemies into pits or directing their attacks at each other. It is for this reason that the game is enjoyable, as it gives the player choice.\n\nOn a final note, a flaw that draws away from the game's successes. The coin system proves awkward and slow. Whereas in FTL the player unlocked new ships through accomplishments and milestones, Into the Breach forces the player to complete achievements to earn coins, which can later be spent on unlocking new mech squads.

It takes maybe an hour complete, and unlike FTL there's very little to bring you back here.\nOverall I'm disappointed in this.

excellence.\n\nSubset Games has once again given us a challenging, deep, yet highly replayable masterwork.

The battles are fought on 8x8 tile maps. In battles, your goal is to protect buildings spread across the map being destroyed by your enemies. The key to succeeding in that task is careful planning of your units' movements and actions by responding to and altering the turn execution plan of your opponents' next turn. During your turn, you can, with 100% transparency, see what your enemies intend to do next turn, e.g. attack a building or attack one of your units for X damage. You can throw wrenches into the enemy units' plans by pushing them around. Almost all of your units (as well as your enemies') attacks move whatever they hit a set amount of tiles back or sidewards. You can use this to crush enemy units into mountains or push them to attack other enemy units. You lose the game when the enemy units succeed in destroying too many buildings on the maps you deploy your units on.\n\nThe remainder of gamplay (approx. 15% of your time playing), you manage the strategic layer of the game, purchasing squad unit upgrades like increased damage, new weapons, or new (usually highly movement-related) abilties for your mechs. You can unlock different mech squads through gameplay, which greatly enhances replayability (and achievement hunting) for this product.\n\nOn the presentation layer, you get an awesome Ben Prunty soundtrack, an informative and functional UI presented in pixel graphics with strong FTL vibes.\n\nHighly recommended, as it feels very very very satisfying to figure out your \"best play\" for any given turn.", "timestamp_created": 1519821349, "timestamp_updated": 1519821349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40460227": {"recommendationid": "40460227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031858784", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 204, "last_played": 1520803959}, "language": "english", "review": "Superb game !!!!

Other than that you can undo any number of moves as long as you don't perform an action.\n\nAll enemy turns are telegraphed and you have unlimited time to decide how to best proceed with your counter attack.   \n\nThere is a LARGE diversity of mechs\n\n7 Prime\n6 Brute (tank)\n6 Ranged (artillery)\n5 Science (weird)\n\nEach has a 'primary' type weapon, however you can mix and match any weapon to any mech by paying +1 power cost.\nYou can equip two weapons/passives (total) per mech as well as a few minor upgrades outside of pilot bonus's\n\nUnique pilots have a 'special' skill and all pilots gain levelups which grant randomized bonus's\n\nIt is also not prone to RNG failure.\n\nMy reservations: SPOILERS Ahead!!!!\nThe game feels short per playthrough, that being said there is HUNDREDS of hours of playtime here to try/unlock everything\n\nEach Continent is 4 missions +boss HQ mission.  2-4 islands per playthrough(your choice) + final 'island' (2missions)\n\nThis is a maximum of 22 missions per 'map' of 5 turns average. 110 turns of 3 mechs+auxilary units.\n\nThis is a great, fun and deep game that will have you thinking of solutions; and if you try to win with every squad you will have a TON of playtime.  I just can't help but feel the game would be better with 7-8 islands and 6-10 turns per map.  More pilot levelups would be cool too.\n\nThis game can only improve!

It is easy to learn, but difficult to master. Highly recommended!\n\nWhat I like about the game:\n1) it focuses on the important things, like gameplay, replay value, easy access (i.e. without need to read manuals or long tutorials)\n2) the gameplay is in small chunks of 5-15 minutes, depending on your speed solving the \"puzzle\". \n3) Immense replay value due to lots of different units with different abilities, weapons and pilots\n4) difficulty: on normal the game is challenging enough that typical gamers may need several attempts, before they make it to the final battle> Easy and hard difficulty allow to make adjustments, if normal is to easy/hard...\n5) graphics and sound: i love the pixel art, it is beautiful and also doesn't distract from the important things happening on the map. Music is great as well, really fits the game. And it is running smoothly on my surface tablet computer... \n\nI played quite a bit of Slay The Spire and I appreciate that Into the Breach has like the former an indication of the enemy 's upcoming action that requires \"counterplay\". This makes the game a bit of a puzzle, requiring your units to work together to meet objectives. E.g. getting a supply pod with equipment is really valuable, but is it worth taking damage on your mechs or the power grid for it. Many decisions require careful planning and thinking ahead. Into the Breach is a bit like chess (not just because of the 8x8 board). It requires resource management and a good understanding when you have to make a \"pawn sacrifice\".

Size and scale of individual engagements have been reduced here if comprared to most tactical turn-based games on a grid I've seen before, but there is enough things going on that the action becomes 'compressed'. There are effectively no 'empty' turns or even individual actions that are just busywork to continue doing what you decided several turns ago. But the engagements are small enough that it doesn't get tiring. This careful balance of meaningful density even manages to offset the lack of elevation differences on the playing field - something I am usually against in this kind of game - because the game manages to make the stage layout, unit movement range and modes matter regardless.\n\nSpecial mention needs to go to the UI. It is simple, clear, concise, but very informative. Detailed preview of the results of an attack action helps visualise the results very handily before you commit to it.\n\nIf you are familar with FTL, a few things could be directly compared and contrasted with it:\n\n- Shop location is much more easily predictable now, even if you still don't know the wares beforehand.\n- The finale of a run can be attempted before all 'sector' equivalents are finished, if you feel you are ready / not sure you will get more than you'll lose. The engagements scale to your progress to allow earlier challenge / compensate for late arrival.\n- 'Ship' specific achievements still exist, but you are no longer required to get 2 out of the set of 3 to unlock another starter options. Every achievement rewards a Kestrel coin instead which you use to unlock what you want inbetween runs.\n- Overhealing of the 'hull' gauge gives benefits now.\n- Losing 'crew' replaces them with perk-less mooks that can gain no exp in the next engagement until you manage to get a replacement pilot. But there are potential benefits to having expendable team members, including equipment options encouraging suicidal tactics.\n- It is possible to carry over a single surviving pilot at the end of a run, win or lose, into the next one. Exp caps appear to be fairly low so far, but level up benefits can improve mech perfomance quite notably.\n\nI have enjoyed my time with this game so far and am looking forward to following developments, in case any expansions will happen in the future.\n", "timestamp_created": 1519817665, "timestamp_updated": 1519817665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40459251": {"recommendationid": "40459251", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968845711", "num_games_owned": 507, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1520877914}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoying this game a whole lot.

Etant fan de strat\u00e9gie tour par tour, j'avais juste vu le pitch et le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du gameplay, j'\u00e9tais curieux. \n\nEt apr\u00e8s quelques minutes de jeu, je suis souffl\u00e9. La profondeur strat\u00e9gique, les possibilit\u00e9s de chaque escouades,.. Sans non plus raconter le jeu voici quelques points qui font (pour moi) de ce jeu, un petit bijou de Game Design :\n\n * Al\u00e9atoire minimis\u00e9 : seul les r\u00e9compenses et les missions sont al\u00e9atoires. Les d\u00e9g\u00e2ts, les actions, la r\u00e9ussite sont fix\u00e9s \u00e0 vos seuls comp\u00e9tences de strat\u00e8ge. Pour un jeu qui se rapproche \u00e9norm\u00e9ment d'un Rogue Like, c'est plaisant d'avoir le temps et de savoir que le r\u00e9sultat \n\n * Punitif mais pas que : Vous avez valider votre tour et vous n'aviez pas vu ce petit monstre qui va vous conduire au game over directement ? Tant pis pour vous, le jeu ne vous fera pas de cadeau... ou presque. La possibilit\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9faite de conserver un pilote avec toute son exp\u00e9rience vous permettra de recommencer avec un petit avantage lors de la prochaine partie.\n\n* Jouer en r\u00e9action : \"Bon du coup, si je fais \u00e7a, peut-\u00eatre que si, ou peut \u00eatre que \u00e7a\" NON ! Ici, Vous savez exactement ce que va faire votre adversaire. Je vous vois les joueurs de Fire Emblem sur Emulateur qui utilisent des Save States au d\u00e9but du tour pour revenir en arri\u00e8re car l'IA vous a fais le pire coup. Into the Breach vous offre l'oppportunit\u00e9 de savoir exactement les intentions et l'ordre d'action de vos adversaires. Il faudra utiliser ces informations pour contr\u00f4ler, d\u00e9placer ou tuer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments adversaire avec vos capacit\u00e9s. Il est ainsi possible pour les adversaires de s'entre tuer !\n\nEt j'en passe sur les d\u00e9tails, entre les \u00e9v\u00e9nements de cartes (Tsunami, Bombardement, Gel...), les quelques 30 mecha \u00e0 dispositions, une farandole de succ\u00e8s/challenges... vous avez l\u00e0 de quoi jouer des dizaines d'heures pour un prix d\u00e9risoire.\n\nAh oui, j'allais oublier. J'adore l'ambiance graphique. \"Ouais lol, c'est un jeu GameBoy Color\"... Jean-Kevin, va jouer \u00e0 Call Of et m'ennuie pas. L'ambiance est coh\u00e9rente entre elle, c'est fluide, et puis au moins je peux y jouer m\u00eame sur un petit pc portable au cas o\u00f9. Les informations sont claires et compr\u00e9hensive.

On aurait pu craindre que ce fut un One-shot, une oeuvre artistique unique que les d\u00e9veloppeurs ne parviendrait pas \u00e0 \u00e9galer; au fond de moi, j'en \u00e9tais convaincu.\n\nIl a fallu attendre le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2018 pour pouvoir \u00e9ssayer ce nouveau titre et cela confirme une chose: l'\u00e9quipe de Subset Games est talentieuse.\nUn nouveau style de jeu (de la strat\u00e9gie au tour par tour) qui vous met aux commandes d'une escouade de 3 ROBOTS GEANTS face \u00e0 une menace insectoide inaretable. Vous avez une escouade de base d'autres sont d\u00e9blocables en ...r\u00e9ussissant des succ\u00e8s steam, je trouve \u00e7a plutot sympa, \u00e7a donne envie de s'investir dedans, apr\u00e8s je vois deja des gens raler et qu'il aurait mieux valu tout avoir d'un coup mais passons.\n\nLes robots sont sur une petites cartes qui contient des batiments qu'il faut prot\u00e9ger \u00e0 tout prix, \u00e0 chaque fois qu'un b\u00e2timent est d\u00e9truit, on perd de l'\u00e9nergie, si la barre d'\u00e9n\u00e9rgie tombe \u00e0 0, vous mourrez et vous recommencer en choisissant un de vos pilote pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant, offrant ainsi une petite continuit\u00e9 d'une partie \u00e0 l'autre.\n\nLe jeu est quasiment un puzzle game ou chaque carte (qui dure 5 minutes) est un ensemble de probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 r\u00e9sourdre pour avoir le r\u00e9sultat le moins d\u00e9geulasse possible: vais-je sauver ce batiment au prix de mon m\u00e9ca? Dois-je abandonner l'objectif secondaire car trop risqu\u00e9 alors qu'il m'offrait un bonus?  Il faut faire des choix, souvent compliqu\u00e9s, il faut anticiper ces mouvements et l'utilisation des comp\u00e9tences. Une erreur et le plan que l'on a mis en place s\u2019effondre, d'autant que le jeu est extremement brutal et sans concessions.\n\nSimple en apparence, le jeu faait s'imbriquer une multitude de syst\u00e8mes : la direction des attaques des ennemis etant connue \u00e0 l'avance, on peut s'arrager avec les comp\u00e9tences des mecs pour le pousser \u00e0 attaquer un autre ennemis, le faire tomber dans un trou, le pousser sur une mine, ou le pousser sur une montagne qui fait un point de d\u00e9gaat en plus,... je pourrai vous parler des combinaisons possibles pendant 30 paragraphes mais je vais rester concis.\n\nSi des objectifs secondaires sont r\u00e9ussis, ils octroient des \u00e9toiles, qui \u00e0 la fin d'une zone (il y en a 4), offrent l'opportunit\u00e9 d'acheter du matos pour avoir de nouvelles comp\u00e9tences, qui doivent \u00eatre aliment\u00e9es en \u00e9nergies et les g\u00e9n\u00e9rateurs sont rares et pr\u00e9cieux, impossible de pouvoir am\u00e9liorer tous ces mechs, il faut faire des choix constamment. \n\nVotre barre de vie peut \u00e9galement revenir en prot\u00e9geant les centrales de la carte tactique.

After all the enjoyment I got (and am still getting) out of FTL, it was a no brainer to drop $15 on Into the Breach the moment it was released. \n\nI've seen people describe it as if Pacific Rim were a game of chess. Sometimes you've gotta make tough decisions, decisions that may lead to you sacrificing a pilot to protect the power grid or meet a battle's objective. Sometimes you have no choice but let a building be destroyed, sacrifice those civilians, lose that power grid, because it's the only way you're going to stay in the fight. It gets tense. It's punishing in the same way FTL and X-Com are. But it's incredibly rewarding when you find yourself staring at the screen for a couple minutes, trying to figure out how to make it through this turn alive and come out on top, and then it comes to you. I'm digging the hell out of this game.\n\nAnd on a note about actual mechanics, I love that you're given an indication which tiles will be affected by an air strike or earthquake or whatever. When cataclysms would hit in FTL, you only knew what was coming, not where. It could be brutal and lead to the quick end to a lot of otherwise great runs. Having indication of where things are going to happen in Into the Breach gives you a little more to plan around and avoids needless frustration.

Units have few stats, and in general, limited upgrade options. Which in a traditional turn based setting like Disgaea or Fire Emblem would be problematic, but in this \"micro strategy\" setting works just right, with the end result feeling more like FTL and Chess had a baby.\nThe removal of traditional RPG elements lends itself better towards making the game about positioning and strategy. Finding additional weapons greatly change the way a unit can be played and open up a whole new range of tactical options.\n\nThe design philosophies of simplicity and \"no one winning team comp\" are quite clear in the end result. Each squad plays quite differently and have their own unique strengths and weaknesses, and inevitably will appeal to different players.\n\nWhile the games are so different its maybe not a fair comparison, but many of the most frustrating elements of FTL have been removed. While still difficult, the game is significantly more forgiving than its space faring counterpart. For example the ability to completely redo a turn once per battle will be a huge boon to new and old players alike.\n\nIts to early to say if Into The Breach will have the same staying power in our hearts and minds as minds as FTL did, but its clear that Subset Games 2nd work is filled with just as much love as the first.", "timestamp_created": 1519781940, "timestamp_updated": 1519781940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40450752": {"recommendationid": "40450752", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125204081", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520305939}, "language": "english", "review": "Great small scale tactics game. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1519781845, "timestamp_updated": 1519781845, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40450674": {"recommendationid": "40450674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132666438", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "last_played": 1520630610}, "language": "english", "review": "Very addictive Game", "timestamp_created": 1519781490, "timestamp_updated": 1519781490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40450622": {"recommendationid": "40450622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024734347", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 267, "last_played": 1521249162}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is full of bugs - and a wide variety of ways to kill them all. \n\nShoot them.

The starting squad's artillery has 2 health, does 1 damage, and has an AOE knockback on the missle's point of impact. The second squad's artillery has 3 health, 2 damage, knocks the target back 1 square, AND leaves a smoke cloud behind you. Again, I can't wait to hear people yap at me about how it's strategically valuable to have that much knockback, but let me tell you, I played a single run with the second squad and I can't count how many times that smoke screen saved my ass.\n\nAlso, each mission is reflexively difficult.

Even moreso, it has that darksoulsy element that no matter what happens on the screen, you fully and entirely know it's all on you. You can never honestly cry out 'bullshit!' at the game, since it always provides you with all the tools you need; all that remains is just the small matter of you not sucking.\n\nThe game is really pretty lean, but it's the kind of game you that's truly replayable. Be it the first hour or the sixth, you have to reanalyse the battlefield equally the same each time. A lot of things may seem important, unit health, power, reputation, and in the end, what you do each round is pick the top two things you can't leave the map without, and work on those.\n\nThe game is also really cheeky with its saves and checkpoints, making sure you can't ALT-F4 out of a bad decision, but it still allows you one turn reset per battle, which is more than acceptable, to make sure to safeguard you against your own stupid mistakes.\n\nITB is a beautifully designed, balanced, and rounded game and it didn't fail to live up to the hype.", "timestamp_created": 1519780350, "timestamp_updated": 1519780859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40450413": {"recommendationid": "40450413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012000191", "num_games_owned": 782, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 639, "last_played": 1521599150}, "language": "english", "review": "I killed a bug with a laser fired from Metal Gear REX.

Into The Breach. Where do we begin? It's by Subset Games, which means it's a roguelike, it's has their pixel graphics style and a cracking soundtrack by Ben Prunty.\n\nContinuing on, this is not Advanced Wars. It is not the spiritual successor to Advanced Wars. Despite being turn based and taking place on a map delineated as a grid, it varies quite fundamentally. The enemies telegraph their attacks as they plan them, meaning that you the player know exactly what the AI has planned and can then start throwing spanners into the works. And by that I mean shuffle the board. In Into The Breach you'll find that your weapons are only effective against basic enemies, and if you really on their raw damage output, you're screwed.\n\nInstead you may choose to instead of punching the enemy from this tile you decide to punch them from this one instead, and all off a sudden they've been knocked into the sea. Rather than use a killing shot on an enemy, you hit them with an attack that causes smoke, preventing them from attacking, saving that killing shot for a bigger threat. These tactics are also reinforced by the fact that you're not there to dominate, you are there, like the rest of humanity, to survive. Whether or not you kill all the Vek is irrelevant, they'll pack up and go home once the the map times out. It's your job instead to protect the civillians and their homes.\n\nIn terms of how can I brace against RNG, you can do a bit. The grid defense % is essentially the evasion meter of FTL. Word of advice, do NOT depend on it to save you from screw ups. The higest it can go probably 49%. Realistically, 30-35% is what you'll see on a [i]really[/i] good run. If you have one of your mechs die so that the run doesn't end, it's rebuilt so you aren't left a [strike]man[/strike] mech down. Resetting the turn so that you can try and find a better solution is also an option too.\n\nOh and the final multi-stage boss fight is primed to crush you like the bugs you crush yourself... so ITB definately inherits that trait of FTL.", "timestamp_created": 1519778627, "timestamp_updated": 1519778716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40450037": {"recommendationid": "40450037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202151152", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520134958}, "language": "english", "review": "I know it may seem a little early to be praisingthis game, but it very much deserves it.

The climax is tremendously unsatisfying.\n\nI got nearly a perfect score on my very first runthrough of the game, and I'm not exactly a tactical genius. The basic tools you're given are incredibly powerful ('push' mechanics are insanely valuable) and the game is so forgiving of mistakes that I didn't feel genuinely challenged the entire time. Coming from the FTL pedigree, I expected a game that would require mastery in order to succeed, but what I got was a game that can be bumbled through to completion on your first attempt.\n\nDon't get me wrong - the game is extremely polished and FUN, but when I finished the final mission all I could say was \"....that's it?\" Where's the big, challenging final boss? Where's the climax? All you do at the end of the game is defend a bomb until it blows up (from basically the same set of enemies you've encountered all game,) and then when it explodes, your mechs just... disappear to go help \"other timelines.\" The story has no resolution, you don't actually feel like you've made any kind of real difference.\n\nInstant kills are too easy to achieve - pushing any non-flying enemy into water deletes them instantly, and multiple missions give you control of extremely overpowered superweapons that just obliterate large sections of the map for free, every turn. The enemy reinforcement mechanic is problematic, too - it's easy to block enemies from spawning, so if you can get an advantage in numbers in the first few turns you can basically auto-win the subsequent turns, leisurely picking off single enemies as they spawn. I finished multiple missions with zero enemies alive going into the final turn, and I'd just pass without even moving a mech.\n\nLook, I'm not asking for FTL here. That game was rightly criticized for being heavy-handed with RNG and having a final boss that blatantly cheats. But Into the Breach swings the pendulum WAY too far in the other direction for my tastes.\n\nOther steam reviews have called this \"easy to learn, hard to master\". Maybe that's true, but since the game never actually demands mastery from the player and provides no suitable avenue to challenge a 'master,' I wonder why anybody would even bother. Just pay a little bit of attention and you'll win with ease, which I find extremely damaging to my long-term enjoyment of a game.\n\nUPDATE: Just completed hard mode with a set of unlocked mechs. I can now confidently say that this game does not offer the kind of difficulty or longevity I was hoping for. I'll probably play more of it - it's a very fun casual strategy game, so if that's what you're looking for, by all means pick this up. If you're looking for an experience like FTL with tons of content that will eat dozens of hours of your time while you slowly master the game, this isn't it.", "timestamp_created": 1519776785, "timestamp_updated": 1519804052, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 200, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618149", "comment_count": "31", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40449602": {"recommendationid": "40449602", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973304016", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1253, "last_played": 1521001915}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome turn-based roguelike mech combat for a great price!", "timestamp_created": 1519776633, "timestamp_updated": 1519776633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40449555": {"recommendationid": "40449555", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986232902", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "last_played": 1521463724}, "language": "french", "review": "Je me suis laiss\u00e9 tent\u00e9 par ce jeu, voulant un jeu strat aux graphismes old school, et bien je ne suis pas d\u00e9\u00e7u !!\nDifficult\u00e9 au RDV, si vous voulez pas vous prendre la tete un minimum, ne prenez pas ce jeux !\nil y a pas un moment ou on ne reflechit pas, toute les action que l'on fait son importante !\n\nUN BON JEU !!", "timestamp_created": 1519776358, "timestamp_updated": 1519776358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40449512": {"recommendationid": "40449512", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991073556", "num_games_owned": 365, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 861, "last_played": 1521313088}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good, it makes you feel nice, and it makes you feel frustrated sometimes.

Each map has several buildings that you must protect, the buildings serve as your HP or Life Points, and you will have to sacrifice damage and make clever use of mechanics to protect them while you also aim to destroy the enemy.  \n\nEnemy attacks are broadcasted 1 turn in advance, allowing you to accomplish a great deal despite only controlling 3 units at a time.  For example, say you have two enemies attacking a building from a different angle.  You could simply kill both enemies, but your units will not always be in the right position or have the required damage to kill them.  Letting both of your buildings take damage would be a very punishing turn, and would have dire consequences for the rest of your current campaign.  The optimal move to make would be to push one enemy unit into the enemies line of fire, causing the pushed unit to miss its target, simultaneously blocking the other units attack (and damaging the pushed unit via friendly fire).  \n\nFTL fans will have a new game mode/style to learn, but many similar rogue-like elements from FTL have found new life in ITB.

However in my 6 hours of play today, I never felt like the findings would make or break my run - just provide incremental assistance.\n\nAll told, highly reccomended I think. 15 is a nice price, the gameplay is rewarding and fun, and Ben Prunty's music is great here as well.

This isn't a fatal flaw but getting your first victory doesn't bring a huge amount of satisfaction.\n[b]~ The music is thematically off.[/b]  It's too poetic for a setting where giant machines are smashing up huge bugs.  It's good music!  I can see why they're charging $6 for the soundtrack!  But it feels more like a deal they made with Mr. Prunty where they get cheap, high fidelity music and he gets his work featured for sale alongside a Subset Games title.  I'd say the soundtrack is just an OK match with the game, not amazing.\n\n[h1]The Review[/h1]\n\n[b]Consider:[/b] each stage is played in an 8x8 tile arena (like chess) with specific pieces with their own quirks and skills (also like chess).  But where in chess your pieces are already determined, ITB lets you choose sets of 3 pieces - or mechs - to be deployed as you see fit.  Knowing the enemy set and terrain of an island beforehand, you are challenged to use those 3 mechs as a team to beat an enemy.  An enemy that is slightly/much stronger than you, but with the crucial advantage that you can see what they will do before they do it.\n\n[b]This is much like[/b] trying the different layouts of ships in FTL.  Different ship, different upgrade paths, and different starting crew.\n\n[b]- The biomes and terrains[/b] and objectives are randomized.  But there's a clear pattern to how the maps are put together.  You'll often see water on the map edge for example, or rows of cities together with a power plant next to them.\n\n[b]- I certainly can feel[/b] that each map I am outnumbered and therefore need to treat it like a puzzle.  A puzzle that reveals itself turn by turn, forcing me to adapt.\n\n[b]- As of the first island[/b] (think Super Mario game worlds) I can feel a lot of variety in the enemy skills, and in terrain variances and considerations.  My mek's skills are relatively boring but I haven't acquired any mek upgrades yet so I am anticipating the strategic possibilities - possibilities that I am uncertain of the existence of.\n\n[b]Also, the art style[/b] is completely [b]SNES/Sega Genesis[/b] - that's a [i][b]!GOOD THING![/b][/i] btw.\n\n[b]- I recommend it.[/b]  It doesn't feel totally THE SAME as FTL, but the approach to development feels the same and I feel confident that I'll have the same amount of interest in this as I have in FTL (ie. 70+ hours).  If you liked FTL, I'd say there's a good 70% chance that you'll enjoy this as much.  However there are many mechanical differences; almost 0 RNG for instance (not zero though, more like 10%).\n\n[h1]Responses to criticisms:[/h1]\n\n[b]1 - [u][i]\"This game is too short!!!11!  FTL was better!\"[/i][/u][/b]\n\n[b]R: Apparently ITB is beatable[/b] within an hour, however it took me a good 4 hours at a lazy pace to beat it for the first time.  That said, isn't it true you can beat FTL in 5 hours as a newb?\n  Especially on easy.

Into the Breach is even better than FTL[/h1]\n\nFTL was Subset games surprise hit, out of nowhere was this finely balanced, brilliant game that could run on anything and was both accessible to just about anyone with a vague understanding of \"Man go here\" and \"Zappy lasers make boom\" but allowed for the kind of finesse and theorycraft that a hardcore strategy game would actually lift an eyebrow at. Not -both- eyebrows mind, but one for certain.\n\nIt was such a success the poor developers had to duck into hiding for a while as the sheer awesomeness of the game (which, by the way, if you don't own it yet, FOR THE LOVE OF DOG FIX THAT) literally blew them away, this was also backed by a seminal soundtrack by Ben Prunty which has probably seen him become the hottest thing since sliced bread as far as game soundtracks go (if not, again, that's a crime against humanity). He's back, much like Subset games, the three man band once more, making a new, and completely different game, rather than play it safe with \"FTL the second\" (HELLO AMPLITUDE, NO HIDING AT THE BACK, WE ALL KNOW WHAT YOU DID WITH ENDLESS SPACE 2 AND IT WASN'T FUNNY), they've been bold.\n\n[i]Very bold.[/i] And dear lord has it paid off, welcome to the end of the world, the planet is overrun by giant godzilla size nasty things that come out of the earth like an episode of Earth Defence Force and you're pretty much the last one standing, so the only fix? Go back in time and try to find a timeline where you don't suck. This may take a few goes. You get to select a mech team of three, all with clearly defined roles, and a named pilot (the other two spots go to Redshirts, competent redshirts mind, but definitely redshirts).\n\nThis is \"hard\" strategy in the sense that your enemy sets up their moves first, your job is then to mess up their plans as much as possible during your turn before they execute theirs. It's a blindingly simple formula that works effortlessly, you have perfect information on what your enemy is *going* to do at the start of your turn, you have limited resources (each unit has one move action, and one use action) and you must maximise their efficiency to protect the board resources against an ever growing threat.\n\nTLDR? They move > You move and act > They act - That's what a turn looks like, by inserting you right in the middle of their turn cycle you get to *react* to their plans and by knowing exactly what's coming, there's no unfairness or BS from the AI. All the information including damage (there's no chance to miss, there is a slim chance for a building to -resist- but if you count on that you're a braver Tiger than I), and zones under threat is served up cleanly and easy to parse. Think invisible Inc but in a much tighter space.\n\nNothing is kept away from the player, there are no AI fudges, no hidden bonuses or maluses, you know where units will spawn on the next turn (and can even use that information to your advantage), you can manipulate opposing units through push and pull actions depending on what you have equipped (and through use of this you can slam enemies into the terrain and each other), as well as debuff them in a variety of ways, and of course, you can kill 'em.\n\n[H1]Mind. Blown.[/H1]\n\nMuch like FTL you're given a [i]massive[/i] number of unlockables to unearth, in this case coming both in the flavour of pilots with portraits and skillsets, and mech companies who bring their own unique weapons mix to the table (the first company is, much like FTL's baseline ship, actually pretty competent all round, and as you unlock the more esoteric options, you'll come up with increasingly clever strategies to bug hunt). There's even the option to configure your own custom mech loadout (though the requirements to earn medals from that setup are steep, demanding you show some real mastery of the game at that point).\n\nThe opening mech team is effective, if a little weak on damage, and will find themselves in need of serious upgrades if they are to remain capable beyond island two, however, once you unlock Blitzkrieg or the Rusting Hulks, the game opens up dramatically, electric smoke and weapons that can chain through half the map really give you ways to clean up large chunks of the map in a hurry, though with the additional power comes the need to manage positions and be a lot more careful in the use of such things (big weapons mean big messes if you're not careful).\n\nThis is a game where every decision really does matter, and every turn is laden with cost/benefit choices, do you protect a city block or put your mech in harms way in order to buy your ailing power grid a little more time, do you make a high risk blitz move to kill some bugs knowing your mech is going to be on nearly no health the next round, who do you prioritise, can you find a way to shove that high health bug into the water, instantly killing it, the game is full of micro-decisions that keep the game tilting between victory and defeat and it never feels like you're effortlessly coasting nor being utterly overwhelmed (except the times you screw up, and then you *know* things are going to hit the fan).\n\n[H1]They've done it again damnit. They've done it again![/H1]\n\nGraphics and sound are very much stamped with that FTL signature, retro graphics but once again to a superb standard, with the kind of soundtrack that's going to have people reaching for the \"Buy soundtrack\" button again. FTL had one of the best soundtracks for it's time and Into the Breach isn't that far behind it.\n\nIt took a long time for the makers of FTL to come up with something and you know what?\n\nIf they serve up dishes this good, I'm happy to wait.\n\nVerdict : [b]Buy the everliving hell out of this. They've done it again, those magificent bstrds[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1519751883, "timestamp_updated": 1519790228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 111, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.786377", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40442359": {"recommendationid": "40442359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013401684", "num_games_owned": 351, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 50, "last_played": 1520873708}, "language": "english", "review": "I've enjoyed it so far.

Buy with confidence! [/h1]\n\nI'll expand this with updates (see below) once I spend more time with it, but for now I want to help anyone trying to decide if this is a day one purchase versus waiting for a sale. All you need to know is this: if you like turn-based strategy in the theme of Advanced Wars (or even X-Com minus the RNG), Pacific Rim-esque mech vs. monster battles, or light RPG progression systems you'll really enjoy this.\n\nIf you're like me and you are sort of obsessed with all three of those things, you'll freaking love it. The combination of those elements works so well together, and the result is a little slice of nerd heaven. Buy it now-- you won't regret it.\n\nInitial impressions are 100% positive-- it's fun, yet challenging. The graphics are great as long as you enjoy this brand of retro-style visuals (I do). Same with the story/lore: it does the job well enough, but the gameplay is the main event here.\n\nThe tutorial was succinct and didn't hold my hand too much. I have played the first few missions on \"normal,\" and I found myself winning but rushing/playing a little sloppy and realizing I had to slow down and approach it with an almost chess-like mentality. Some might call this a \"hard\" game, but I would say it's simply a game you can't rush through-- which is exactly what I hope for when strategy is involved. It will be worth your money for that reason alone.\n\nIn other words, you have to think like this: \"If I make this move now, how will this affect my future turns? How will it affect the enemy's turn?\" That's standard with turn-based games, of course, but the \"pieces\" in this game have pretty rigid rules and the maps are pretty small, so it amplifies that chess-like intensity in each turn.\n\nHere's a quick example: maybe I decide to get in the path of an enemy attack and take damage this turn to protect a building, but then I might need to heal my mech on my next turn and that will remove my ability to attack with that mech (since I can only attack or heal, not both). With that in mind, I might choose to have a particular mech (you have three at your disposal in the matches I have played) take damage so I can utilize the unique attack type of one of the others-- perhaps to do something specific like punch an enemy into the water for an instant kill.\n\nThat's just one simplified scenario, but you get the picture. I'm sure that aspect will be fleshed out even more as I continue to play and unlock content, thus getting exposed to new elements.\n\nWell, that's all for now-- back to playing for me. I have Vek to kill and buildings full of innocent people to [strike]save[/strike] accidentally destroy by punching a Vek into them.\n\n[h1]Update #1:[/h1] After a few rougher matches that I barely survived and a little internal debate, I actually ended up starting a new game on easy just to get a feel for some of the more in-depth strategy before diving back into normal. I highly recommend this approach. It's not that the game is too hard on normal, it's just nice to be able to focus on soaking up knowledge on an easy playthrough before eventually ramping it back up. I just finished my second island, and I'm really having a blast now that I'm unlocking some more upgrades that make the strategy even deeper. Your mileage may vary, but I like the thought of getting the fundamentals down before I shift back to the more challenging enemies.\n\n[h1]Update #2:[/h1] Well, after just under 3 hours I have \"beat\" the game. I'd estimate about an hour of that was my first \"normal\" playthrough before I started the \"easy\" campaign that I beat pretty... well... easily. I wouldn't worry about the game being short though, because if it weren't for life obligations tonight I'd be starting up my next timeline (think of it like a New Game+) and continuing on to the higher difficulty. The gameplay is going to keep you coming back for sure. I don't see myself getting tired of it for a long, long time.\n\nI will admit it slightly complicates the discussion of value though, because some might prefer a longer campaign of original content versus starting over with new randomly generated missions that will look and feel pretty similar to your previous runs. But here's the thing: I can tell there's still a ton of content I haven't seen/used/unlocked yet-- based on the long list of Steam Achievements alone I've only scratched the surface.\n\nI'm particularly excited to keep trying out different Mechs since that will change the gameplay dramatically. I'll do another update once I get a few more runs under my belt. That should give me a much better idea of long term replayability.\n\nIt's still a [i]very strong[/i] recommendation from me thus far!\n\n[h1]Update #3:[/h1] I've completed 3 or 4 runs now, and I'll just say that the fun from trying out new mechs and their abilities gives the game some major replayability for sure. Also, the desire to complete achievements and beat old scores adds even more on top of that. Definitely worth the money if you are motivated by those types of incentives-- but be forewarned that there is essentially no additional story, character development, etc. after your first run. I for one don't care because it's not that kind of game and the gameplay itself is so addictive, but others might be bothered so it's worth mentioning.\n\n[h1]Update #4:[/h1] Well, this is probably my last update. I'm about 50% done with the Achievements. Now I'm no Acheievement hunter usually, but with this game I'd argue that Achievement completion is a good gauge for replayability and the overall life of the game in terms of fresh content. Why? Because the Steam Achievements line up with the usage of new mechs and experimentation via additional playthroughs. In other words, if you're doing multiple playthroughs and focusing on experiencing new content each time you'll continuously be getting the Achievements along the way.\n\nSo, my point is that if I continue at this pace I'm guessing I'd be able to really \"finish\" the game (AKA get most of the Achievements) in about 30+ hours. Now that being said, some Achievements are much, much more difficult than others. As such, you can probably add a healthy chunk to that total.\n\nThe reason I'm going down this path of thought is to dispell any concerns about value. I'll admit my only pain point with this game was seeing the credits roll for the first time only a few hours into playing. I loved the gameplay, but I worried if I'd get $15 of value out of it.\n\nI can definitively say that you'll get a heck of a lot more than $15 of value out of this game now that I've experienced roughly half of the squads. And even after you achieve everything, I can see it being a game I'd come back to from time to time just to try and beat my old scores and experience the gameplay again.

I'm only assuming that things get increasingly harder/complicated as the game progresses. chess with mechs is a summary I've seen a number of people make so far and it's pretty accurate.\n\nEDIT: since I've now played it a little more I thought I'd try and say a bit more about it. WHile you initially start with only one island unlocked, finishing other islands allows you to select those to starrt with on other playthroughs and progress is scaled so you aren't neccesarily faced with the toughest units right off the bat. the final encounter is unlocked after you've finished any two islands in a single playthrough but you can continue and try to save people on the other islands to increase your end score if you so wish. Earning new mechs and squads i tied to achivements in games which is a little furstrating for me as some of them seem pretty difficult to get. an alternate method of earning new mechs/squads in further updates would be nice (thankfully acheivemtns are earnable offline).

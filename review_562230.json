While I can't say I'm a regular patron of the 4x genres, I do have room for an occasional space sim (see: Master of Orion), and I've grown fond of the genre in later years. Let me emphasize this 4x is not like any other - this is not about managing bases on planets, or diplomacy: it is about pure and utter conflict. The gameplay is simplistic in a beer & pretzel sense, where it does not require lots of focus to achieve a mission. What I like most is it seems to streamline the formula down to its essential core. Some people may find games like Civilization appealing, with its millions of choices, but all of that snowballs down into the same end result in a few dozen hours. Space Tyrant is refined. And it is different: with its focus on combat and its fun--YES, I said fun--personality. I think it captures the essentials of what makes a 4x fun, and its wholly unique in its focus on invasion and conquest. If you like 4x, or 4x set in space, buy it. If you find the overwhelming complexity of a Civilization game overwhelming, buy it. If you like strategy, but find it wholly lacking in depth of personality, buy it.

This was my final [i]final[/i] attempt.\n\nNow, I do like [i]Space Tyrant[/i] quite a bit, but it does suffer from some of the same issues that other 4X games have. The saving grace is that it simplifies things and distills mechanics down to something more digestible. [b]It's for this exact reason that I would guess traditional 4X people probably won't trade in [i]Civ[/i] or [i]Stellaris[/i] for this title.[/b] I think a staple of the 4X genre is having a complicated and breathy system.\n\nAnyways, [i]Space Tyrant[/i] is fairly easy to learn and has some great humor. Yeah, the RNG is wily, but it's also wily in those other 4X games BUT the RNG is just hidden better. You know I'm right about that. \n\nAt some point this title was described as a coffee-break game, but I disagree. Yes, it is easily played with one hand, but matches are certainly more than about 20 minutes. They are shorter than competitor titles, but still. The other point of concern is the roguelike nature and permadeath. That part makes me nervous, but the jury is still out on that. The permadeath spans over an entire CAMPAIGN that will easily take you, oh, probably 5-10 hours to complete. One false step and it's back to the begining. I'm not sure it works here, but again, I still need to play more.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+You can't even tell this is Early Access. \n+Controls are intuitive and there is a solid tutorial system to ease you in.\n+It definitely has that one-more-round addiction going on.\n+They nicely distilled what I would consider an overly complicated system that 4X games adhere to into a bite-size package.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-While the music is good, it is very repetitive. There isn't enough variation.\n-RNG is fairly brutal, but more importantly - everything hinges on this idea of permadeath and I'm just not sure it makes it more 'fun'. I'm still thinking on this.\n-Alot of the dialogue is quite humorous but I find myself skipping through to see the end result. Again, the RNG leaves something to be desired. Choices don't feel meaningful.

In fact, for the first 10 or 20 hours, I thought it WAS great.  I found myself wishing there were more of this sort of simplified, lighthearted 4X game.\n\nI'll leave the list of things it does right to all the other good reviews, and just talk about its problems.\n\nFirst, the difficulty of missions is extremely uneven.  The devs seem to leave to much control over missions to the RNG that you could be immediately set upon by a legitimately impossible confluence of events, or encounter zero drama from turn 1.\n\nThere are several different mission types, and in my experience, only one (in which you must capture and hold 2 of 3 specific planets) is consistently tense.  The others are always effectively decided within the first few turns - either the game throws everything at you as quickly as possible, or it doesn't.  If it doesn't, the entire mission is dead easy.\n\nIt also has a problematic meta-strategy layer wth the senate control mechanic in the mission selector.  My first ragequit happened when I won the last of the initial 12 missions you have to win before taking on the senate.  Upon winning it, the senate promptly sent two ships to the same area that already had 2 ships in it.  4 ships in one area, even for a moment, and the campaign is over.\n\nI WON the last mission, kept more than 2 senate ships from ever being in the same area at any time for the entire campaign until the literal moment I won the last mission, and was greeted with the \"game over\" screen.  I've rarely been so mad at a video game.\n\nWith a few tweaks to smooth out the difficulty and fix a few \"we've decided you lose now\" problem mechanics, it'll be great.  Even with its frustrations, I still can't bring myself to give it a thumbs down, though.  Thumbs up, but I'm done playing until it impoves some things.", "timestamp_created": 1505508265, "timestamp_updated": 1505508265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34963139": {"recommendationid": "34963139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048910194", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506838009}, "language": "english", "review": "With its store front claim of delivering a \"fast-paced roguelike-lite 5X\" experience, chunky UI, and colorful cartoonish graphics, Space Tyrant may at first glance seem like just another one of those hyper-casual mobile games that we're seeing more and more of on Steam these days; but beneath the veneer lies a brilliantly conceived game that, despite lacking the depth of many 4X games that fans of the genre celebrate, delivers an entertaining experience that can be just as satisfying.\n\nI've always had a soft spot for games that let me be the bad guy. Space Tyrant endeavors to join the ranks of titles like Dungeon Keeper, Evil Genius, and Overlord by casting the player in the role of the ultimate... well... Space Tyrant. You'll find no diplomatic standing screen here. There will be no trade routes. You will not be tweaking your economy (unless brutally oppressing your hapless citizens to increase their productivity counts as \"tweaking\"). You will foster no alliances, shaky or otherwise. There will be no negotiation. The galaxy will either submit to your will, or you will destroy it with your lasers and missiles. Or maybe you'll be the one who gets destroyed by lasers and missiles. Actually, that's probably what will happen.\n\nThe premise was immediately enticing to me, but even though my curators were recommending it and all of the other internet buzz surrounding the game was positive, I held back. The reason was simple: \"Fast-paced\" and \"4X\" are mutually exclusive terms in my world. I like my 4X games with layers upon layers of depth. I enjoy being able to wrest control of the universe from my enemies using strength, wit, and guile (along with a healthy dose of economic min-maxing). My current all-time favorite of the genre is Distant Worlds, and I've long since decided that if a 4X game can't deliver that sort of deep experience, then I simply don't have time for it.\n\nThankfully, after having been practically browbeaten by my peers into buying the game, I discovered that Space Tyrant is far more than it seems on the surface. A campaign plays out almost like a series of board games, if board games could be randomly generated. I won't get into the mechanical specifics of the game, as so many other reviews have already covered that; suffice it to say that despite the seemingly simple premise of \"just blow everything up to win,\" there are tons of strategic and tactical options available to the player over the course of a campaign. Will you prioritize conquering crystal worlds in order to utilize your most powerful cards? Or will you favor wealthy worlds in the early game to quickly bolster your fleets? Or perhaps you will focus on tech worlds, so that even your most meager fleet will be able to deal with hordes of ill-equipped enemies.\n\nYou will need to do all three to succeed, but how you choose to prioritize objectives based on enemy movement, playfield layout, and other RNG factors will make or break you. Yes, you can play this game quick and dirty; but if you're not paying attention, the Galactic Senate will end you. Or the RNG. Or the space sharks. Yeah, there are space sharks. With lasers on their heads. Because why wouldn't a space shark have a laser on its head?\n\nSo in closing, if you're like me and find yourself hesitant to try this game based on any sort of 4X bias, just stop it. Stop being a 4X elitist. You should be ashamed. I know I am.\n\nThis game is not even finished yet, and it's already awesome. Buy it and play it already.

Your aim is to conquer the galaxy: you move your ships through the universe to capture the planets, combat enemies and encounter all sorts of random events as you keep capturing new bases.\n\nThe game process is the following: right now, you get to choose a side, then you have the \u201cuniverse\u201d map shown: you can assault one of three galaxies, while the fourth one is being locked away. Then, you are moved towards the galaxy where you have to complete a specific objective: capturing planets, acquiring wealth, researching new technologies. You choose a commander which determines what kind of a special ability your ship is going to have. It also gives you some mini-objectives for the mission that can influence your play style: completing them makes you stronger, you can get a special powerful cards that can be used on the galaxy map. You direct your fleets through \u201cpaths\u201d between planets, and if they encounter another fleet \u2013 the battle starts.\n\n[h1]The Battles[/h1]\nThe battle itself is pretty simple: two fleets stay opposite to each other and exchange fire. The targets are chosen randomly. Each of your ships has a special ability that they can use on the click. . (each side has only 4 purchasable ships (+ a few bonus stronger ones), but those 4 get upgraded as you play, adding stats / improving their abilities). The chosen hero also has a special ability like meteor strike or thorn wall that influences the battle. In addition to that, you get an active special effect of your choice at the start of the battle (think of it as a random mutator, like small ships deal 2x damage, destroy all fighters, and so on). So yes, while this sounds simple, there\u2019s plenty of space for decision making. \n\nIf you got confused by that \u2013 that\u2019s totally cool. In fact, this is what makes the game interesting. The mix of different things that you can do. What makes it even more impressive is the fact how tutorials are made: those are the sequences of small videos that gradually introduce you into the game as you play. Instead of reading walls of text, you\u2019ll be watching small videos that introduce you to the game.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\nOnly a few things hurt my experience: At the moment of writing this review, there\u2019s no difference between clicking with left / right button. So when you pick an ability (i.e. death ray) and want to cancel using it \u2013 right click will actually trigger it the same way as left click.\n\nAnother thing is lack of battle targeting: sure, you influence the way the abilities are being used, but it\u2019s frustrating not to be able to pick targets. I\u2019ve lost one game 6v2 when 2 enemies didn\u2019t do much damage, but kept regenerating shields and my fighters picked targets in worst possible way: 3 were firing at one ship, 3 \u2013 at another.

This game doesn't have the strategic depth of the Galactic Civilization nor Master of Orion series, but it's a fun, streamlined experience.\n\nThe tactical combat is fun and usually quick.. Ships are aligned opposite each other and the player can activate special abilities as a power meter charges up. The different ships have a mix of strengths and weaknesses. The perks you take during the campaign can also reinforce strengths of certain ships. This provides a pretty good variety for repeat plays. However, towards the end of the campaign, you'll usually have locked in on a specific strategy and the combat starts to feel a little repetative.\n\nThe two alien species current available for campaign play different and have different perks. The Hoplite have much stronger ships that in my playthough could be upgraded to dish out a lot of damage very quickly. The Bzzerk were more economy focussed with weaker ships and a weaker seige die. Once their ships were upgraded, they were much better at holding their own in a fight.\n\nThe rogue-lite elements are interesting. Each play of a campaign progresses more and more towards unlocks. It would be nice both the unlocks and the requirements to unlock were known prior to ending a campaign (win or lose). The downside of this is that in my two campaign plays, I didn't get to build the higher-tier ships. These ships are unlocks, but they don't appear to unlock until after a campaign. Considering I beat both campaigns, I don't have a lot of incentive to replay.\n\nThere's a card system that allows you to generate a quick boost or ability. The cards have a crystal cost, and crystal planets provide the resource to play them. It's a neat little system and makes this feel a bit more like a board game. As you play, more cards will be unlocked giving you access to better abilities. The commanders, which you'll pick one at the start of a mission, also have per mission card unlocks. In general, these commander cards give a good incentive to push for specific goals. One thing I didn't like was the unlocks based on losing in combat. This seems counter-intuitive, and I'd rather see it be X ships lost in combat.\n\nThe variety of mission structure keeps things changed up. Some missions are about taking over a percentage of the galaxy, others are about accumulating wealth, playing so many cards, accruing a set number of crystals, or controlling 2 of 3 points on the map. SInce the missions break up what you're going for, it keeps the strategic layer of the game interesting.\n\nEven though the game is early access (EA), this feels like a complete game for the price. The bugs are minor and seldom occur. The main bug I ran into was strategic layer would occassionally stop recognizing mouse clicks, but it was resolved by exiting back to the main menu and going back into the game.\n\nOne minor quibble is that you can only have a single campaign going. This is like an EA issue, since they're focussed on the gameplay rather than setting it up to allow multiple save files.\n\nOverall, this is a very fun 4x game. In it's current state, I have about 20 hours of gameplay in. That was 20 hours to beat both campaigns, with a third campaign still in development. I think anyone that enjoys this game will easily get around 30 hours gameplay out of it. If you love the game, then there's certainly replayability to add more.", "timestamp_created": 1503795053, "timestamp_updated": 1503795053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543478", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34514067": {"recommendationid": "34514067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031988893", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511696233}, "language": "italian", "review": "Of course YES !!!\n\nIt's a game easy to earn, but hard to master, primarily in the last missions when for every choice \nis critical to think: which card, fleet or planet is the right one?\n\nP.S.: EA, but neither a bug!\n\nThank you!", "timestamp_created": 1503780746, "timestamp_updated": 1503780746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34508348": {"recommendationid": "34508348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107371645", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514940859}, "language": "english", "review": "I rarely write reviews.

But while true, sticking to that description is a disservice to the game. There\u2019s definitely more to it than that. It\u2019s engrossing and it\u2019s easy to spend several \"lunch-breaks\" back-to-back trying to master it.\n\nSpace Tyrant is surprisingly deep and full featured \u2013 especially for an EA title. It\u2019s not especially hard, but the learning curve is a little steep. Once the game mechanics are understood however, things become easier. But, in proper roguish fashion, it will throw villainies and surprises your way. You can expect to restart your runs a few times.\n\nThen again, why wouldn\u2019t you want to? Space Tyrant is plain fun. The humor is fitting and smart, the mechanics work, the flow of the game is effective \u2013 it has both style and substance.

After re-reading what I wrote, I thought it would make a decent Steam review.  So here you go!\n\nI think it\u2019s great fun and would have jumped on it with a 33% discount without hesitation. I jumped in at the 10% EA launch discount and have no regrets. And if you use a 16:10 monitor, they just added support for that ratio yesterday. At first experience, the tactical battles may seem simplistic and without much player involvement, but once you understand what\u2019s happening, you really need to spend your energy wisely.\n\nOn the campaign map, you\u2019re the tyrant fighting to dominate the galaxy, but are opposed by the Galactic Senate, which is trying to control the three sectors. If they manage to control any one sector with four ships, you lose. Completing missions in a sector will beat their ships back.\n\nI\u2019m about four missions into my first campaign and have seen a nice variety of cards, planet types, events, and abilities. You, as the tyrant, can equip three pieces of equipment (which are unlocked as rewards for completing a mission) that give you benefits during a mission. Other mission rewards include unlocking more powerful cards for your faction\u2019s deck and Empire rewards (such as more powerful ships). After each successful mission, you choose one of two perks, whose benefits persist throughout the campaign. Each mission is rated between 1-5 stars; the more stars, the more difficult the mission. Each also has 1-2 goals, and some even have quirks, like poorer cities (planets), tech planets with greater tech income, more asteroids, etc.\n\nAfter choosing your mission and outfitting yourself, a sector is generated, populated by random planets controlled by no one, neutral forces, or the Galactic Senate. You have to use your fleets to conquer the planets. But the Galactic Senate is also tossing its support to the planets, changing them from neutral (gray) planets to GS (red) planets. Neutral fleets won\u2019t move to other planets to attack your fleets and planets, but GS ones will! You also have to contend with the occasional rebellions.\n\nAfter you conquer a planet (by reducing its defense to zero via rolling \u201cd6s\u201d), a multiple-choice event may trigger. Some of the choices may be locked; you need a specific unidentified trait to unlock them. These traits are sometimes gained by choices you make during events. So you\u2019ll acquire traits like Hitman, Diplomat, Scientist, etc, each of which has multiple ranks and all of which persist throughout the campaign. The outcome of your choice will be positive, negative, or nothing. Also, each planet may or may not have a power, like a cannon that can fire on enemy fleets within range or mercs that will add an additional die to your next invasion roll.\n\nToss in your hand of cards and a tyranny meter (which powers your Death Ray!), and you have a lot of options available to you. And I haven\u2019t even discussed the tactical battles in detail!

Pair that with many core mechanics being seemingly very random and you're up for a lot of frustration.\n\nOne smaller issue I've had is replayability: almost everything which would bring variety is locked and unlocking ANYTHING  takes many missions.

Please [url=http://wp.me/p8lFHx-5uL]visit the original review here[/url] with all the screenshots etc.\n\nTo give you a rough outline of what this is about, you take on missions to conquer networks of planets. Each turn you send your little spaceship fleets to battle with the enemy fleets on the adjacent planets and then once you\u2019ve defeated them you can invade the planet with a big dice. You get gold income from conquered planets which you can use to purchase new ships for your fleets, and crystal planets increase the number of points you can use to play your powerup cards which are added to your \u2018hand\u2019 on each turn. Domination is the ultimate goal, of course.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThere is a LOT happening all the time in this game, so I\u2019m going to try and explain this with screenshots.\n\nFirst you choose your faction. As you can see, I haven\u2019t even unlocked the second one yet.\n\nThen you select a mission. Each has a 4-star rating depending on difficulty. Take note of the \u2018SENATE CONTROL\u2019 boxes. I found to my cost that if those four boxes fill up with red triangles, it\u2019s Game Over, so don\u2019t just blindly go for the easiest missions like I did. When you successfully complete a mission you get a skull. Fill everything up with skulls and you beat the campaign.\n\nSo when you start a mission you\u2019re told what your goals are to win. There are various different objectives each time, like conquering special planets, amassing gold, conquering a certain percentage of the galaxy etc.\n\nAt first you have only your home planet and a small fleet. The best thing to do is go on the attack immediately! Move to the next planet where an enemy fleet is orbiting and the battle screen will open.\n\nNote the Death Ray over on the right, it measures your Tyranny. It goes up and down depending on how quickly you\u2019re expanding your empire and obliterating any fleets that dare to join the Senate. If any of your fleets stay in one place for too long \u2013 well, at all actually \u2013 you\u2019ll pay the price here. You have to keep relentlessly crushing agitators and moving on to keep the Death Ray topped up. If it drops too low it\u2019s Game Over \u2013 not just the mission, but the whole campaign! If you get it up high enough then a big red button appears and you can zap a few enemy ships with the big pointy finger in the sky!\n\nThe cards at the bottom of the screen can be played at any time during your turn. [chopped]\n\n[screenshots of battle]\n\nThe trick, of course, is to never go into a battle that you can\u2019t win! If you have a bigger fleet going into the battle then you\u2019ll (nearly) always win.\n\nBattles are fast and furious! Look at all this! These battles generally only last about 15-30 seconds, it\u2019s intense. Blink and you\u2019ll miss it!\n\n... and eventually you\u2019ll get a bigger fleet:\n\nOnce you\u2019ve defeated the enemy fleet you can then capture the planet for your empire by rolling the dice. [chopped]\n\nWhen the planet is conquered you get a few choices of planet exploration, some have good outcomes, others bad. [chopped]\n\nSo you continue like that, conquering one planet after another. You can release new fleets by conquering prison planets, hiring a new commander from your home planet with 300 gold, or get them for other reasons. Like I said there\u2019s all kinds of stuff going on.\n\nHopefully you\u2019ll eventually reach your objective, complete the mission and receive your reward and a perk, then it\u2019s on to the next mission.\n\nAll in all, it plays like the turn-based strategy version of DOOM \u2013 you\u2019re rewarded by pushing forward relentlessly and taking undue risks. Glorious death is rarely in vain as you\u2019ve softened up the enemy for your next wave.\n\n[h1]False Sense Of Security[/h1]\n\nThe AI is absolutely diabolical! And I love it! Three times now my campaign has been suddenly and unexpectedly halted in mid-flow while I wasn\u2019t paying proper attention. Each time I was kicking arse and taking names in my missions, vanquishing foes left, right and centre. Then they stabbed me in the back. The first time an enemy fleet sneaked up behind me and took my home planet while I was too busy cutting a swathe of devastation elsewhere. The second time I got busy making my home planet into an iron fortress, ignoring my Death Ray which plummeted until the galaxy rebelled and it was Game Over again. The third time I really thought I had everything covered this time. Nope. It turned out that I\u2019d picked the wrong missions and allowed the Senate to take over a sector without me even trying to defend it!\n\nEach time this happened you\u2019d think I would storm off in a huff, but no. I was grinning from ear to ear and raring to go again, shaking my fist in the air like Grandpa Simpson. There\u2019s nothing quite like discovering something genuinely surprising in a game. Fabulous.\nCrushed!\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\n\nThe list of things I love about this game is pretty long, but right at the top of it is the way the learning curve is handled. From the moment you start playing the fun never lets up. At first it\u2019s just joyous chaos, with things popping up all over the place, decisions to make, tips to follow and generally not knowing what the hell is going on. Mad as a box of frogs. Slowly but surely you get the hang of it, and before you know it you\u2019re planning routes, counting ships, calculating your odds and turning into a proper Tyrant. Until the AI blindsides you, of course. Haha!\n\nThere are no overall difficulty settings, it just becomes increasingly difficult as you progress, with one to four-star missions. The more experience you get, the further your campaign will go.\n\n[h1]Value[/h1]\n\nThere are three main factions to play. When you beat a full campaign then the next faction is unlocked and you can start all over again with, I assume, different powers and so forth. The third faction is not ready yet, and will be a main feature of the full release after Early Access. With that said, each mission takes a couple of hours to get through \u2013 and the time really flies! It\u2019s going to take me many hours to even beat the first campaign so there\u2019s more than enough to be getting on with already. This feels like a full, complete game. I\u2019ve found no bugs, no annoyances but plenty of gameplay. It\u2019s definitely worth full price even at this stage. The EA phase here is just for adding extra goodies to the pile.\n\n[h1]Steam[/h1]\n\nThere are no trading cards or achievements yet but they will be in the full release. Please don\u2019t let this put you off in any way. There is personal achievement to be had in beating these missions, never mind about Steam.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nI\u2019ve played enough slow, tedious turn-based strategy games to know that this one stands out due to the fast-paced, exciting combat that keeps you constantly engaged and trying to push the boundaries of your power against a fairly clever AI. It\u2019s challenging and addictive while the gameplay is intuitive once you get into the swing of it. The artwork and music make it even better, and the native Linux version is the cherry on the delicious cake.\n\n[h1]Aftermath[/h1]\n\nAfter 60+ hours of trying I finally managed to beat the first campaign! Yay! I had to beat the final five-star mission and capture the Senate\u2019s home planet to do it. I\u2019m a proper, legit Tyrant now I thought, so I started a new campaign and decided to be cocky and go for the enemy\u2019s home planet. This was a one-star mission, easy peasy right? Well, I was brought crashing down to Earth when my own home planet was invaded. It just goes to show, a Tyrant must be vigilant at all times, there are always agitants plotting and scheming behind your back. Seriously though, there is endless replay value here \u2013 ruling the galaxy once doesn\u2019t guarantee a repeat performance.\n\n[quote]More reviews at SaveOrQuit.com[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1502022473, "timestamp_updated": 1502022473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633047", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34000400": {"recommendationid": "34000400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021798612", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503114686}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game for Early Access.

You play as the titular Space Tyrant, in command of one of three races; militant rabbits, swarming angry bees, or technologically advanced slugs. After choosing your race, you are brought to a mission select screen, where you also manage your campaign upgrades. The campaign upgrades you earn include racial perks, commander equipment, and new cards for your deck. Here, you choose which mission to undertake, your goal being to conquer at least one sector before the Galactic Senate does the same, then take the war to the homeworld of the Galactic Senate itself.\n\tAfter selecting a mission, the real gameplay begins. Space Tyrant is turn based, and operates on a nodal movement system; your fleets only orbit planets and can only move between them per predesignated lanes. Although mission objectives vary, you'll be accomplishing all of them through military conquest. Tyrants have no time for diplomacy. Your fleets resolve planetary sieges through dice rolls. You roll a D6 until the defense score of the planet is zero. This is familiar territory, be prepared for frustratingly low rolls during critical sieges. Before the siege begins, of course, you must rout the defenders.\n\tCombat is mostly autonomous. Your vessels select their own targets and fire at will. Your participation is limited to the deployment of tactics and ship abilities. You recieve a tactical ability from a choice of three at the beginning of combat, sometimes useful, sometimes not so much. Each class of vessel for each race has an ability which can be activated for energy, a recharging resource. The combat reminds me of old Ogre Battle games. Although smart ability usage can turn the tide of a battle, combats tend to be won or lost beforehand. Winning these battle grants experience for your commander, allowing them to level up and lead larger fleets.\n\tPlanets provide you with gold income, research, mana, or special bonuses, such as new commanders or additional siege dice. Cash is used to purchase warships, research unlocks new technology (all of them military), and mana is used to play cards. You draw one card per turn, and you can play them on the campaign map for a wide variety of effects. When you initially conquer a planet, you 'explore' it. This exploration plays out as a choose your own adventure dialogue box. These choice outcomes can be good or negative, and can give your Tyrant traits which influence future explorations. This is where a great deal of the humor of the game is derived. You are brutal intergalactic Tyrant, so your choices are often variations of 'nuke them' or 'throw them in the torture box'. \n\tMy primary frustrations with the title mostly came from the fact that the only options to interact with the environment (beyond the rare but powerful planet powers) involve your military, but your fleets only move one node per turn. Enemy planets can run projects to disrupt your empire, such as economic sanctions or propaganda, which can only be stopped by conquest. Your own planets can also rebel, again, requiring one of your fleets to painfully and slowly backtrack one node per turn, wasting an astonishing amount of time. Enemy planets can begin projects to cripple your empire from anywhere, but you may not have fleets in position to respond. I would have loved to see some way to respond to these projects. Bribes, assassinations, and counter intelligence all would be thematic options for the player to have.\n\tSpace Monsters are also present and caused me some strife. Space Monsters are powerful leviathans that protect valuable planetary assests. This alone is fine, but the monsters also patrol neighboring nodes. This gives you an opportunity to siege the asses while the monster is away, but the monster tends to move toward your fleet. This is troublesome when you move onto a node that you don't know is adjacent to a monster's den until it's too late. The monsters are powerful enough to scuttle anything but the strongest fleets, so you may need to kiss that fleet goodbye through no fault of your own.\n\tFinally, some the late game missions drag on. Most of the missions can be resolved in under an hour, but the final missions can stretch well beyond that, especially if you have to contend with the aforementioned backtracking or monster rampages. Not necessarily a demerit, but something player should be aware of.\n\tArtwork and UI is clear. I especially like the small touches on the ship desigsn. The rabbits have long ear-like structures, the bees have hex-grid patterns, and the slug ships have bulbous snail shell like structures. Sounds are passable, although the soundtrack is a little parse and some of the sound effects levels are inexplicably loud.\n\tAlthough I was initially skeptical and I had some frustration with the fact that losing an early mission before you get a back up commander end your campaign, I found myself seeing the strategic space availble and enjoyed the time I spend with the game. This particularly true on the difficult later levels, where every turn was a demanding struggle to achieve victory.

I don't mind RNG in games, but it seems like every time you need a two or more to take a planet you'll get a one instead. When the AI invades? It's always on the upper end of the rolls. Sure, I've seen them roll a two or a three every now and then. But more often than not they'll roll a five or six and take a planet in one go, while your fleet is going for it's third attack on a planet that only had a value of four defence. And God help you if you get the wormhole event. You might get lucky and it'll send your fleet only a planet or two away. Or more likely it'll send your main fleet to the other end of the galaxy.\n\nThen there's restarting from the beginning if you fail a mission. Now from what the game says you can unlock other commanders as a kind of \"extra life\" system. I didn't make it that far, as whenever I'd get to the mission where the next commander is the reward, either I'd fail due to the enemy fleets outnumbering mine by a mile and overrunning me. Or I'd immediately hit the wormhole event and watch as my only fleet hit the other side of the galaxy. I don't mind difficulty, but this is just frustrating as all hell.\n\nI don't normally write reviews.

It neatly dodges the two biggest complaints about 4X games: 1) the AI is bad and 2) the game bogs down in micromanagement.\n\nThe AI... well, sure, the AI isn't really competent.  But that's OK!  Victory is not about beating the AI, it's about accomplishing your goals before something goes wrong.  Victory is more like a rogue-lite, where you race against time.  The unrest meter slowly ticking away, planets rebelling, the Senate fleet growing, all these things build up until you just can't go on.  The AI is mostly there to stick a finger in your eye at the worst possible time: Your fleet is finally in position to attack the Senate capital, but suddenly a planet rebels, joins the Senate and puts your homeworld under siege.  Although the difficulty isn't fiendish - at least in the early levels - It is totally possible to lose this game if you're careless or unlucky.  Later on it gets quite a bit harder.  And watch out for the space monsters.\n\nAnd there's no bogging down, either.  The game plays fast.  The traditional \"next turn\" button conveniently changes to point you at the next thing you need to deal with, and just about the time when you'd start snowballing to a victory in most 4X games, the game declares the scenario won for you.  The worst thing that can happen is some fleet of yours flies off to a random dead-end world... but even a dead-end fleet in the empire's backwater can be used to boost your economics in a pinch.\n\nThere's a side mechanic of card playing, where the cards give you special abilities or new ships - similar to the old game Star Chamber (if anyone remembers that), except you earn cards through accomplishing goals rather than paying money.  There's no real deck building mechanic, and the cards are really a footnote rather than central to the game like in Star Chamber.  The cards are situationally useful, from useless to totally overwhelming and anywhere in between, depending on the luck of the draw and what happens to be on the map.  But they add variety to a game that might otherwise become routine.\n\nThough the game is in early access, it's pretty stable and bugs are few.\n\nThis is likely to always be a niche game, but it fills that niche well.

At least give them a chance to grow.\nPossibility for commander level to modify Invasion dice - Sure, I have a huge fleet and a very experienced commander, still spending 4-5 turns knocking over a planet because of poor RNG. (Idea - Every 2 commander levels adds 1 to the Invasion die result, rounded down).\n\n\nSpace Monsters - The gorram Space Slug, not the Shark, the Shark is fine and eats all comers.\nJust the Space Slug.. which arbitrarily attacks the player's fleets, and ONLY the player's fleets every 2nd turn if you're in range of the Slug's \"home\" tile.. for early access this is ridiculous. The Slug needs to be balanced so that it either goes after all fleets or moves on every 3rd or 4th turn instead of every other turn.\n\nPossible other Slug fix - Space Slug only regens when in combat, not out of combat. If the thing is going to come and eat your Rank 3 commander and his full fleet every time you're in the area because the Senate is running missions against you from Slug Land, he needs to be able to be dealt with, or this game is just another RNG time sink and not actually 4X.\n\nSo maybe your Neutral Monsters disrupt missions if they visit a planet with an active mission, and lacking a fleet to move towards, head towards the planet because of all the noise?\n\n\nCommanders - Have unlocked Greenfoot, and he's terrible compared to Stonehair. Meteor Shower is a powerful ability which scales well and always delivers when you use it.\nThe bramble patch doesn't seem to do enough, yet scales up in cost? How about adding a damage reflect element to the higher levels of the shield? \n\nRedeye, being a berserk inducer from what I've seen, seems to be a good strong Commander at any stage, particularly for the bunnies once they've unlocked Regen field on the Cruisers.\n\n\nCustomisation of the player Tyranny deck?\nUnlocking cards is nice and all.. and I expect this wouldn't happen until an expansion, but how about allowing some customising of the deck you use? In a galaxy map with reduced crystals or erratic ones, it would be nice and strategic if I could strip out the 4 cost Battleship recruitment, or the 5 cost HMS Immaculate Dreadnought, because I just want to play a bunch of low cost cards and not worry about Crystal worlds?\n\n\nDerelict Worlds - Speaking of Crystals and how the inability to customise your deck can make those useless (more RNG is NOT a BETTER GAME even in pseudo-4X land), why not have an inactive Cannon World be able to be powered by a Crystal for one turn? It's got limited range, and once the area is pacified it loses all value, but currently takes an entire artifact slot to use the Cannon.\n\nThis is a lovely double edged tactical sword, becuase it gives the AI something to use crystal worlds for/with.\n\n\nDon't buy this yet, needs more work on balance so that RNG doesn't ruin your campaign when you're 5-6 battles in and force a restart.", "timestamp_created": 1501299828, "timestamp_updated": 1501302137, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434783", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33838779": {"recommendationid": "33838779", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970277863", "num_games_owned": 658, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500482900}, "language": "english", "review": "5 STARS BEST GAME EVER.

Space Tyrant is a game where you can run a few maps in the span of less than an hour, and feel like you've done a lot in that time. Now obviously, if you're looking for the depth of a high-budget 4X you're not going to find it here - your economy is often directly linked to your ability to conquer planets, which in turn will increase your fleet size to conquer more planets as you race time against the Senate, which will attempt to slow your snowball down enough to cause your loss (typically because your Tyranny meter, which decreases over time and increases as you conquer, causes you to lose if it hits 0.)\n\nThere's still a lot left to add - the main reason to buy in now being the campaign mode, which introduces you to the races while giving you some progression via tech/item/commander unlocks - but what's here is playable, and you'll likely get 15-20 hours of fun out of the current build (most of my testing was in a much earlier build, and that still lasted me for about that long.)\n\nRecommended for fans of the genre, especially when played in shorter bursts of time.", "timestamp_created": 1500595560, "timestamp_updated": 1500603959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528986", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33672165": {"recommendationid": "33672165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026946492", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501056933}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very simple space 4x type of game, but it is fun and there is enough of a game here for it to be worth a look even in the early access stage.", "timestamp_created": 1500556773, "timestamp_updated": 1500556773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33671246": {"recommendationid": "33671246", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991316543", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501732590}, "language": "english", "review": "This is something new, and I like it.

Fleets travel along direct paths from planet to planet instead of a more typical free roam in space approach. This makes game pace more direct and faster than other 4x games on pc. In many ways Space Tyrant has more in common with a casual mobile game than a more serious pc game however it would be unfair to dismiss it because of this.\n\nPlanets generate credits so you can purchase replacement ships and sometimes they can have a special planet power however there is no detailed planet management or empire management. This is not a bad thing considering the faster and simpler style of 4x gameplay here. When you conquer a planet you also get a random explore event which adds a nice bit of humour and the chance to get a bonus or something bad.\n\nYou can research upgrades for your ships and there is a nice card gameplay element to the game which is really nice. Early missions only take about 30min to complete but later missions take much longer as the maps get bigger.\n\nFleet battles are nice and interactive with each ship having a special ability that you have to activate when the time is right for best effect. Some of the battle sound effects are a bit lacking though.\n\nStrategy decisions and scope are not on par with other bigger scale 4x games however the game is well focused and a lot of fun to play. The game also has very nice presentation and has a lot of humour.\n\nSpace Tyrant is not a replacement for more traditional bigger scale 4x games but it is a lot of fun to play and worth checking out if your a fan of the genre.

It is made by the same crazy and all around wacky developer/publishers that made Slayaway Camp, my all time favorite puzzle game.  \n\nBut, about Space Tyrant, it's basically a boardgame style of 4X game, with pretty quick levels that you have to beat to progress through the campaign to achieve your ultimate goal of being the Supreme Galactic Tyrant.  Or something like that.\n\nIt definitely has a nice and fairly light 4X feel to it, with semi-automated combat.  You build your fleet from a number of ships, frigates, battleships, carriers, and quite a few others that I haven't gotten to yet.  Each ship also has a special skill/action that you have direct control over during combat.  Also, your commander has their own special skill/action, and there are multiple commanders to recruit into your lordship's empire.\n\nIt's a really unique game that will feel familiar to anyone who enjoys turn-based strategic/tactical space combat games.\n\nI played pre-early access, and there is still more new stuff to come that I don't even know about yet.   \n\nOh yeah, there is also a card playing aspect that gives you LOTS of extra powers that you can use each turn.  \n\nAnyway . . . it's a blast to play, has a wonderful sense of humor, and the Blue Wizard folks are top notch developers.\n\nHighly recommended for some 4X turn-based strategy with a lighter side to it compared to the heavier 4X games out there.  Super enjoyable, high quality product.\n\nI'll stop rambling now.

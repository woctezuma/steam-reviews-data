These folks really cared about what they were making and it shows. The writing is excellent, the voicework is top notch, the music is catchy, background and character art and UI design are all well done, and really the whole experience is a cut above most of this game's contemporaries.\n\nKindred Spirits has quickly become my favorite yuri visual novel game, and is really a contender for the most well put together visual novel that I have ever played to be honest.

This is so important and so needed because, while more and more VNs these days feature same sex romantic couples, which is fantastic to see, it's still very uncommon for a game to have some/all lesbian content and have it all end up with happy endings. So commonly do you see ones with really messed up scenes or just depressing results to their romances and it makes it hard to even enjoy playing games like that. Not so with Kindred Spirits, and that's so very important. We need more games like this one that leave you feeling good. We need more movies and TV shows with happy endings for same sex couples too for that matter[/spoiler].\n\nThere was one part in the game that actually did bother me personally. It was maybe 6 or 8 hours in to the game so not very far, and the way that the events played out seemed to run contrary to the tone and precedent of the game up until that point. Words were said by one of the characters to another that I felt were not healthy or \"okay\" at all, and actually rather cruel. Specifically I am speaking of (SPOILER:) [spoiler]the start of Kiri and Tsukuyo-sensei's relationship when Kiri confesses and Tsukuyo-sensei dismissed Kiri's feelings, telling her they were just a \"misunderstanding\" and a phase that younger girls often go through[/spoiler]. Thankfully though, as the game progressed, this issue that I had with it was actually addressed as part of the story, much to my pleasant surprise, and handled well enough overall that I felt okay about it after that turning point. I was impressed that the staff and writers went so far as to examine a scenario like that, and just knowing that they took that on only added to my respect for the game that Kindred Spirits became.\n\nAnother thing worth noting is that this game does feature some adult content scenes without even requiring a separate uncensor patch file to be downloaded. I think that's good progress on Valve's part for finally allowing this kind of content on Steam directly without having to have workarounds like we've seen up till now.\n\nIf you're concerned about the adult content, I was really surprised and pleased to see it was very tastefully handled and innocent. A lot of 18+ content games don't really know how to show loving relationships or innocence very well, and I believe it takes a skilled writer to be able to pull off tenderness in a lovemaking scene. Kindred Spirits succeeds wonderfully at this. If you were worried about the content being too graphic or vulgar, you've got nothing to fear here. The relationships take time to build before the intimacy happens, (SPOILER:) [spoiler]and the game's story takes place over the course of 8 months[/spoiler], so if you're going into this game expecting things to move quickly you'll be disappointed. I don't mean that in a bad way though. The character development and pacing is great, and by the time the scenes of intimacy come about, you really feel like you know the characters and the intricacies of their relationships well.\n\nI know that no matter how good it is, Kindred Spirits on the Roof will be considered a \"niche\" title, because for some reason a lot of us humans are still not comfortable with the idea of women loving women even when represented as an artform, and on top of that, many people aren't even comfortable enough with their own bodies or sexuality to be okay with seeing sexual content in the games that they play.\n\nIf you ask me, it's unfortunate really that as a culture we're more okay with depictions of shocking violence, pain, and distress, than we are with sexuality and feeling good, but I digress. Chances are good most folks who fall into these categories aren't sitting here reading this review in the first place.\n\nIf you are the kind of person who is open minded enough to not let the fact that this game contains some scenes of an intimate and loving sexual nature between two women bother you, and you enjoy visual novel games, Kindred Spirits on the Roof is one VN you will really be able to appreciate, and its heartwarming story and characters will stay with you for a good while, and leave you feeling glad that you took the chance on it.", "timestamp_created": 1511584459, "timestamp_updated": 1511584459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37457707": {"recommendationid": "37457707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071352364", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510004278}, "language": "english", "review": "I really liked Kindred sprits on the roof!

[/i]\n\nBut to make this brief, I'll give you my pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\n[*] Art. Oh my god the art is beautiful. Cute and sweet and fits this story so well.\n\n[*] Many different stories. If there is a couple you are 100% for, I can guarentee that another one will be just your cup of tea.\n\n[*] Great writing. The stories are sweet and so full of love. Nothing feels that forced, and all of the relationships are very genuine.\n\n[*] Sound design. The SFX and music fit the mood and are so pleasing. The music doesn't get annoying.\n\n[*] Voice acting. The whole thing isn't voiced, just certain scenes. That way the scenes voice acted are so much more poignant that way.\n\n[*] A REAL STORY. The attention to detail in this VN is just so amazing.\n\nCons:\n\n[*] Not many choices. If you like choice heavy games, this might not be for you. The choices you do make unlock extra scenes from the girl's POV's later.\n\n[*] Cultural differences. Some Western cultures have different customs and beliefs which could result in a bit of confusion. Ex. There is a romance between a student and a teacher. The female age of consent in Japan is 16, so both of them are within the age of consent. It makes 100% sense if that makes you uncomfortable, but you need to understand that before playing.\n\n\nAll around, this game is stellar and I will replay it many times!!\n", "timestamp_created": 1511490968, "timestamp_updated": 1511490968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37243063": {"recommendationid": "37243063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063832644", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509500986}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is super adorable.

Es un juego yuri con varias parejas. La protagonista le es encomendada la misi\u00f3n por dos fantasmas, de ayudar a algunas chicas para que puedan emparejarse. \n\nLo que me encanto de este juego es como se daban las relaciones, al principio comienza lento y se muestra un poco sobre la vida de las chicas y sus personalidades. Las relaciones se dan de manera natural, y poco a poco ves como avanzan, lo que hace disfrutar aun mas cuando suceden eventos importantes al punto de no querer despegarte del juego.  Te encari\u00f1as bastante con los personajes y tambi\u00e9n vez como se forman lasos de amistad entre ellas y como se apoyan entre amigas.  \n\nOtro punto a favor es la forma en la que esta organizado el juego, es un calendario donde eliges el dia para jugar, con eso tienes presente de mejor manera las fechas y sabes cuando parar o continuar el juego, lo cual me parece bastante importante en una VN ya que puedes perder el hilo de la historia.  Calve recalcar que las elecciones libres  de los d\u00edas, son las de las chicas a las que ayudas. \n\nPuntos en contra diria que le falta mas sountracks, las pocas canciones que tienen me gustan su opening y ending y la cancion sorpresa de la rockera son geniales. Pero aparte de esas son solo 12 sountracks que suenan mientras lees, nunca me molesto esto ya que disfrutaba de la historia y las canciones eran adecuadas pero si me hubiera gustado que hubiera tenido mas. \n\nUna vez de pasas el juego, te premian dando escenas extras de las personjes a trav\u00e9s de todo el a\u00f1o y una vez terminas eso, sabes que aun hay mas con lo de los CD dramas, que claramente tendr\u00e9 que comprar. \n\nEl juego me divirti\u00f3 y me entretuvo bastante, tambi\u00e9n me hizo pensar cuando ocurr\u00edan problemas a trav\u00e9s de la historia, por ejemplo la forma eficiente de hacer las cosas yuna y como ayudaba a los dem\u00e1s sin esperar nada a cambio o como los buenos consejos pueden solucionar muchos problemas. \n\nCalificaci\u00f3n 10/10 completamente recomendada.

The art is nice and consistent throughout, the music is pleasant and I actually really like some of the songs, the story is nonsense at times but such is the nature of fiction so I think that the story actually culminates very well, and I really like some of the characters and the development of these characters throughout the story. It's a cute, yuri romance that I honestly feel could make a great anime. It has drama CDs and a spin-off manga, so why not?\n\nFull disclosure; I am a fan of anime and I am a guy. A guilty pleasure of mine is Nekopara and I have Steins Gate for the Vita. I am a fan of visual novels because I watch a lot of anime that derives from them and I enjoy video games with a healthy amount of good narrative or visual novel-esque mechanics.\n\nI heard about this game because I saw an article online about it being an \"uncensored\" visual novel on Steam. So I looked up some promotional images for the game and liked the art style. I'm no expert on visual novels, but I've seen images from visual novels where the art isn't consistent. This game has a very consistent manga-like art style that looks good against the game's backgrounds as well.\n\nI went into the game thinking this would be another guilty pleasure like Nekopara but found that I was actually enjoying it for multiple reasons without the need of \"ecchi\" distractions. Right from the beginning the game grabs me with its openning song. I'm a sucker for some anime songs and there are a few songs with vocals in this game that I really enjoy. The lyrics are nice too and the vocalized songs are sung by one of the character's voice actors, which I think is nice. It's all a bit romantic in a shoujo-esque way, though I guess the game is yuri.\n\nA major reason I was enjoying the game before the ecchi parts, and all-around regardless of anything ecchi; I really like the main protagonist. The protag's name is Toomi Yuna. She has a bit of a tomboy-ish, kuudere-ish vibe in that she is very self dependent and solemn with a \"cool\" or \"cold\" look to her character, which is why I found it adorable when she gets caught off guard occasionally and gets spooked or embarrassed, which shows that she is a complex character capable of feeling/showing natural emotions other than those typical of her apparant character. A fault that I hear about in many visual novels, or anime inspired by visual novels, or just anime in general is that the protagonist is unrelateable because they're a blank slate for you to imagine yourself in their shoes, or that the protag is just a terrible one-dimensional character whose involvement in the story boils down to plot for \"PLOT\"; as in they have all sorts of plot armor, plot hole inducing nonsense to make them important, and for some reason everyone then likes them or rivals them for some reason or another, so they are justified in all the \"ecchi\" stuff they get coming their way. But no. Kindred Spirits is way different from that nonsense. Toomi Yuna is a good protagonist. She has her own character which is developed and interesting and is part of a story within the game which is sort of seperate yet ties into her involvement with the other characters. What I mean by separate is that she isn't the focus of the game's ecchi story lines. Her own development stems more from her overcoming her own personal problems to become a stronger character that others rely on. Basically in a bad harem anime the protag gets unexplained plot power so that everyone is drawn to them. But in Yuna's case she isn't a harem protagonist, she's just trying to help other girls fall in love. This is difficult for Yuna because of her personal problems making her a bit of an introvert. But at her core she is a good person so she wants to help people when she knows she can. So she gets out of her comfort zone to help people. This makes her analyze herself and others and she comes to terms with why she was introverted in the first place so that she overcomes her problems. Basically she becomes a better character worthy of being relied on, capable of helping others, and therefore a justified protagonist.\n\nSo the focus of the plot is that Yuna helps girls who are lesbian find love. These girls have their own personalities told through their own narrative which explains how they feel about things, mainly their love interests. All the couples have their own quirks to them and whether or not you like the couples probably depends on the type of characters you like to see in a romance. People love shipping but tend to hate couples that don't meet their personal preferences. So obviously there were couples that I liked more than others for various reasons; some were cuter, some were more fun, some made more sense. But I liked the way the characters' narratives explained who they were and how they felt as characters. Regardless of what makes sense in the real world, I feel like all the couples are justified, more or less, by the characters' backstories, inner feelings, and interactions.\n\nSo this is an adult game in that it depicts relationships in a sexual way and shows implicit sex scenes that are more explained through narrative and vocals than the art itself. They do show boobs, but by todays anime standards it's fairly innocent. Even though it shows sex, it's not oversexualized. Some, if not most, anime today tends to be oversexualized even when it's not adult. Anime also tends to portray risque relationships. This game only really has one risque relationship. The entire game is \"safe\" in a vanilla sense. That's probably one of the reasons it wasn't censored by Steam. But I enjoy the art in general. I also just enjoy the development of the characters in the story. The sex scenes were \"nice\" but they were more like icing on the cake of the couples, sort of like a justification to the \"ships\" or a culmination of the romances naturally leading to intamacy.\n\nSo obviously I didn't explain the story too well as to avoid major spoilers. I just want to add that the voice acting helps define the characters along with the art and the narrative. Not everything is voiced, but you can sort of imagine how a character might say something in their voice as you're reading. The game also presents you with \"choices\" but they're very superficial and don't affect more than a sentence in the next line of dialogue. There is only one route that you simply read through, but visual novels offer more than manga and books because they have art, music, vocals, etc. The ghosts or \"kindred spirits\" are sort of a reason for the plot and a source for everything nonsensical that keeps reminding you this game is leading towards an ecchi finish line, but I still think that the writing in the lesbian relationships is done fairly well and keeps the relationships realistic or even relateable in most cases. I'm a guy, but I like romance too, so I don't even consider this a guilty pleasure; it's just a good romance story to me. So in all honesty you probably wont like all the characters but I'd say you should play it for the ones you will. Again, regardless of all the yuri romances that the other characters present you with, my favorite character is the protagonist Toomi Yuna. I'd play a non-ecchi game starring her, or watch a spin-off anime about her cooking (because she  likes to cook). If you're not sure whether you'll like the characters, just go to the game's official website, it has the rough bios on the characters. But if you're an anime fan who likes a bit of ecchi, likes a bit of romance, and likes \"ships\", this is the game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1507358960, "timestamp_updated": 1507359243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.742818", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35201118": {"recommendationid": "35201118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009251807", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466156129}, "language": "english", "review": "What can I say about this game but just brillant, even if you disregard the fact that it's a yuri game. \n(which don't get me wrong you should'nt it's awesome)\nThe story, art work and music are just awesome, this is the first visual novel that i've played (thanks to LudaAagames) and since then I downloaded many more.\nIf you are on the fence about this game, don't be jump that sucker and enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1506340106, "timestamp_updated": 1506340106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35190198": {"recommendationid": "35190198", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009129621", "num_games_owned": 825, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508792792}, "language": "english", "review": "Okujou no yurirei-san - or Kindred Spirits on the Roof, as the English-language version is called - is a heart-warming romance novel in video game form, with an exclusive focus on girl-with-girl relationships.\n\nAs an long-standing fan of this genre, the characters and the story have quickly grown on to me.

The artwork is crisp and well-drawn (artist is peg and you can find more of their work [url=https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?id=5020]here![/url]), the score is pleasing to the ears and never feels worn out or tiring, and the sound direction is very solid. The dialogue text display is easy on the eyes by default (you can change the opacity of the dialogue text box). I would've chosen a slightly better font, but that's minor and entirely preferential. The voice actors chosen for this game (side note: not all the dialogue is voiced) are very skilled as is apparent by their work here. Not a single character felt like the VA behind them was mismatched, and a few of them absolutely shone out above the rest. The localization of the actual dialogue is also an extreme selling point. The folks at MangaGamer show genuine care for the product they are localizing for stateside release and it shows in the (verified!) high translation quality and stellar editing of the dialogue which helped give the visual novel life.\n\n[h1]WRITING[/h1]\nOnce you get past the fact that the game revolves around a pair of lesbian ghosts, the visual novel is...surprisingly grounded in reality. The characters, for the most part, are realistic without being uninteresting (a few of the characters, specifically Koba Youka, I've grown to be very fond of and am astonished at how especially good their characterization was), and the interpersonal relationships are plausible without being lackluster. I haven't read the original Japanese text, so I can't verify if it was originally written as such or if it was the (high-grade) localization that makes it seem this way, but engaging with the dialogue in this visual novel was very rewarding throughout. This all being said, there was one relationship in particular that drew some mixed reception; the teacher-student relationship. In all honesty, it was somewhat awkward and felt a bit rushed, but it was nowhere close to a dealbreaker for me.\n\n[h1]OVERALL[/h1]\nI don't read many visual novels, but I do engage with plenty of yuri media. And Kindred Spirits on the Roof is one of the finest entries in both of those categories. Do I consider it worth the $34.99? Honestly, I don't know. It does seem to be a bit on the pricier side (especially since STEINS;GATE is the same price and that's longer and more comprehensive), so on the occasional chance that this visual novel goes on sale, please do get it.

Finishing the game 100% (including reading all the extras) took me 23 hours, and I read at a pretty fast pace. There were so many different couples with problems of varying levels of complexity, but all of it felt fresh and fun. I love how closely-acquainted the reader gets to feel with all of the girls through the eyes of Yuna, and I also love how more context and background is provided for characters (in the extras) in relationships that may have felt sudden or contrived in the main story.\n\nThere were only two things that really annoyed me:\n1) The game slows down drastically every couple of minutes of gameplay--which I'm sure most reviews have already complained about. The solution for me was to save immediately and close the game before it froze completely.\n2) Some of the voices for the girls were way too squeaky for my taste. This may not be as much of an issue for someone else, but I'll just put that out there. I got by by clicking and reading quickly, though I suppose it would have been easier to just mute.\n\nAnother thing, there IS a relationship that occurs between a student and a teacher if that sort of thing really squicks anyone out. However, the teacher is very considerate and never holds her status as an adult over the student to make her do sexual things.\n\nAnyway, I love ONYS/KSOTR and all of the girls so so much.

afterwards and listened to all of the audio dramas...and I still want more. It took me a quite a bit put into words what I love so much about this game, and I'm not going to be comprehensive here. Lets just be clear that this VN touched me deeply and I won't ever forget it. I'm going to just ramble about the things I love about it.\n\nI love the painted art, both the character designs and backgrounds. There are so many great/cute CGs that are perfectly used throughout the game. Aika petting Youka on the head, Umi braiding Sasa's hair, the Kindred Spirits and Yuna drinking coke on the roof...many more. \n\nI love the frank way the story handles homosexuality, how it doesn't ignore the closeminded people who think this love is just a phase between 2 girlfriends, but it also completely debunks that silliness. Throughout the 30 hours of content, this story is all about legitimizing yuri romance as equal to any other kind of romance. It does this naturally too, through its characters and dialog. The sparse \"h-scenes\" also do a good job of supporting that, and they aren't explicit or too long. These scenes are used for character development rather than just titilation, and their inclusion is very important to the arc of each couple.\n\nAnd I love those couples, Youka and Aki are my favorite... all of them are sweet and wonderful though. Throughout the game there's a real sense that these folks love each other from the way they talk and think, it's so heartwarming. The drama is smart and never overblown, and the resolution is always satisfying. Not just the romantic couples, the friend couples are a treat to listen to as well. Yuna and Ano have a wonderful discussion towards the end of the game that is pretty much exactly what I needed to hear in a game like this. Everything regarding the characters and dialog work perfectly.\n\nThere are some presentation problems, the music is good but there's too little of it. The art is unfortunately low res and sparse sound effects are sometimes very bad. Even with those misgivings and the rather high price point, this yuritopia is highly recommended.

It's pretty much a kinectic novel (and nothing in the game's description informs players about it), which means, that if you expect some meaningful choices and branching paths, forget it. You don't have an impact on the plot (you can just unlock some extra scenes), you just read the story from various characters perspective and see how their relationships grow. \n\nI enjoyed it for the first two hours or so - probably because of unique protagonist, which is the best part of the game for me. She's relatable, normal girl, that isn't overly emotional and cutesy, which is often an issue with visual novels from Asian countries. Sadly, most of other characters were just annoying. To be fair, with such large main cast, it's hard to not find someone you dislike, but when you find so many of those girls to be either cliche, boring or non-sympathetic, you don't really care about their stories. With actual \"visual novels\", you can find some enjoyment in impacting the story. Here, though, there's nothing to enjoy.\n\n[b]To sum it up[/b]: if you enjoy yuri kinectic novels, you may like it. Writing is fine, although often wonders into \"completely ridiculous\" territory, premise is silly and relationship between characters are rather sudden and very unrealistic.

The story is made for enjoyment and laughter, like an old Jackie Chan film, and sticks to its guns until the very end. \n\nThen you buy the super expensive and way overpriced drama cds, like a fucking sheep, because they've already hooked you in with this. \n\nBut seriously, give this a try. 10/10 great characters.", "timestamp_created": 1488147532, "timestamp_updated": 1488147532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626170", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30016334": {"recommendationid": "30016334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019202729", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 61, "last_played": 1514574655}, "language": "english", "review": "A really nice game.\n\nIf you like yuri, this one is a must!\nIf you like romance, you should try this one, too.\nAnd even if you only want to relax from fighting or killing whatever enemies other games throw at you, this could be the one for you.\n\nYou get some nice yuri-romances without to much drama and happy endings guaranteed. \nThe planer system works pretty well.

The two \"kindred spirits\" died with unrequited feelings in their hearts, met, and fell in love. They ardently wish to experience their \"first time\" together before their eternal rest.\n\n...But they don't know how.\n\nThe two who are bound to the site of the school enlist Yuna to help them create more \"yuri\" couples at the school so that they can glean some sexual insight from observing them, and to assist the girls struggling with their hidden feelings.\n\n\nOverall Thoughts: I enjoyed the ride for what it was. Kindred Spirits was hard for me to get into at first. I say the first 3 hrs are a pain to get through, but afterwards the story is enjoyable as it branches out over the next few months in the VN. The use of the planner makes the game easier to get through imo as its a pacer of sorts. Enjoyed the couples and glad they didn't pair up all the characters.  Good Yuri VN for the price. Drama CDs there if you end up loving one of the pairing and need more afterstory.\n\nPros: Length to price is good.\nGood number of extras after the story is finished.\nBest girl ends of Single as she is best girl.\nR18+ Scenes added-in\nLove the Planner\n\nCons: Lack of music tracks made me mute the game after 5 - 7 hrs in.\nMC background event could have been deeper and more issues for the game length.\nPresonally I didn't care for the main pairing. \n\nSolid 7/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1487395498, "timestamp_updated": 1487395498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498911", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29980903": {"recommendationid": "29980903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130018007", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480052935}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u540e\u6765\u624d\u5165\u6b63\u7684\u3002\n\u771f\u7684\u662f\u6b3e\u4f73\u4f5c\uff0c\u5370\u8c61\u6700\u6df1\u7684\u662f\u65e5\u5386\u4e3b\u754c\u9762\u90a3\u91cc\uff0cSE\u548cBGM\u7b49\u7b49\u7ed9\u4eba\u611f\u89c9\u90fd\u7279\u522b\u8212\u670d\u3002\n\nPS\uff1a\u53ef\u60dc\u4e0d\u80fd\u548c\u963f\u91ce\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u6211\u8fd8\u633a\u559c\u6b22\u5979\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1487326135, "timestamp_updated": 1487326135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508284", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29909586": {"recommendationid": "29909586", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299640955", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501900398}, "language": "english", "review": "You will like this. that is all", "timestamp_created": 1487021393, "timestamp_updated": 1487021393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29888914": {"recommendationid": "29888914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043395028", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485481560}, "language": "english", "review": "so sexist...... i cant believe they just let that tentacle monster loose on all the lesbians at the end.................. i do NOT recommend this... it is worse than yaoi", "timestamp_created": 1486953429, "timestamp_updated": 1486953429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.407744", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29851318": {"recommendationid": "29851318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058960776", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486915786}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u963f\u91ce\u85e4\uff0c\u57ce\u5973\u7b2c\u4e00\u9738\uff0c\u80f8\u4e4b\u5927\uff0c\u5916\u5957\u585e\u4e0d\u4e0b\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1486829744, "timestamp_updated": 1486829744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500921", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29816580": {"recommendationid": "29816580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198266485330", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496451508}, "language": "english", "review": "Yuri :3", "timestamp_created": 1486703448, "timestamp_updated": 1486703448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29785679": {"recommendationid": "29785679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048404089", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485069450}, "language": "english", "review": "As a fan of pure yuri, this game is great.

Yes it's very noticable after 15 to 20 minutes of reading. Playing through the local files did not count my play time. It doesn't look like they, Steam, plan to fix it if they haven't already. That said however, Kindred Spririts is a pretty good visual novel. I went in with pretty high expectations due to this game being the most popular Girl's Love on VNDB. It's not perfect by all means, but it tells a good story. Here's a list of things I liked and didn't like about KIndred Spirits.\n\nPros:\n+ 7 total couples to watch grow closer. Personally I loved 3 of them, found 3 alright, and only disliked one. Not bad.\n+ It's a pretty long game. It took me 3 weeks to get through it doing a few \"days\" at a time.\n+ The story is broken down into day sized chapters. Which makes it great for players like myself who can only play for bits at a time due to life. However, some of these can be longer than others.\n+After following the main story every month, you get to check out various side couple stories through their perspectives. Some scenes are just different POVs from the main story but overall they are unique and each narrator has their own charm to telling their story. \n+ The game does give you a little control in the order you want to do the side stories, which you do have to read to advance the main story, to then unlock more side stories. That's the system of the progression in this game. I kind of like it though it can leave you on some messed up cliffhangers sometimes. \n+ There is a fair amount of sprites for each character, mainly just facial expressions and a few outfits, but it does help to make the game more enjoyable. \n+ The story is heart-warming, touching, and even exciting at times. I did really enjoy the story. As well as a majority of the characters.\n\nBefore I gush on amd on about what I liked let's talk about things I didn't. Cons:\n- You have no control over the story what so ever. The \"choices\" you make are just used after you beat the game to unlock extra scenes. \n-The BGM is lackluster. In fact I would go so far to say a few of the common tracks are down right annoying. Cheery buhdupduh chorus on loop is kind of grating. The rest of the BGM is forgettful. However there is a track that plays during the most touching scenes that is quite beautiful and tugs the heart strings.\n-The game is NOT fully voice acted. Only important and H scenes seem to be. I'd say about 30% percent is voice acted, and that might be a little generous.\n-I was really expecting to hear Youka sing a song that was pretty damn important to the plot. But the lyrics aren't even there either! \n- The premise of the game is that the two ghost girls want to watch other girls do it so they can and then be at peace and move on. It's not really a focus of the game until it dumps H scenes all over you at the end. Mind you, they are done well and tasteful as H scenes can go. And thankfully not that long. But, they should of been spread out more. I ended up really annoyed by them, and only really read the main couple's.\n- Only three couples struggle with real world homesexuality issues. Like peer/family rejection. It's pretty unrealistic that none them face any consequences. On the flip side I guess, it is nice to just see GL bloom. \n\nTLDR: In the end, I'd still recommend it to curious GL fans. It is a pretty good game despite the high price and flaws within. You just need to understand that it is not fully voice acted and your choices don't matter.

I had to go to my game library, right click the game, click \u201cproperties,\u201d click the \u201clocal files\u201d tab, click \u201cbrowse local files,\u201d and finally open the game directly from the folder. It was only after doing all that the game worked without any problems. The only thing about opening the game like that is that steam won't register it which is why I only have five hours on record even though I played it for far longer than that.\n\nI had this game on my wishlist for a while now waiting to see if it'd get a better sale, but after a while it seemed 25% would be the best sale I'd get so I decided to finally pull the trigger and I wasn't disappointed. I'd say this is probably the ultimate yuri visual novel experience just based on the amount of content you get and the fact that you have five different yuri couples to get that you learn about aside from the main ones each with their own fleshed out storyline that runs parallel to the main one.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're a fan of yuri than this is a must buy especially if it's on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1483170346, "timestamp_updated": 1483170346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28845696": {"recommendationid": "28845696", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137573827", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483340141}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u68d2\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u767e\u5408\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6211\u7528F12\u4e0d\u80fd\u622a\u56fe\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1483135581, "timestamp_updated": 1483135581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28812360": {"recommendationid": "28812360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156609837", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483812602}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Pues me esta gustando pero por alguna razon despues de un rato se pone lento y tengo que reiniciarlo para que vuelva a ponerse normal.", "timestamp_created": 1483062174, "timestamp_updated": 1483062174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527897", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28778189": {"recommendationid": "28778189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204041428", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501571527}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has given me the highest standards as to what to expect in yuri games from now on!

Honestly, this visual novel is just absolutely horrendous, and the character's personalities are as flat as their chests. \n\nFirstly, the entire premise of this garbage is inherently flawed. Lesbian ghosts who try to push real-life lesbians into couples? Really? Do you have an extra chromosome or two? That is just the worst idea for a story I have ever heard. The guy was probably kicked out of his literature course in University and lives in his mom's basement eating chicken tendies. \n\nSecondly, the writing is on par with the level of shitty harry potter \"Harry x Dumbledore\" fanfiction. Who ever the writers were don't understand human beings and how they interact. I imagine their experience with actual people - women specifically - is limited to when they visit those japanese maid cafes. \n\nHayao Miyazaki is often misquoted as saying \"anime was a mistake.\" But it's right, it is absolutely right.

The artwork for the game is equally good, especially the event scenes. As for the music, it fits in really well with the type of mood that is present but there aren't that many different variations in the music leaving it to mostly repeating however it's better than having no music at all. While it is rather expensive for a vn, the quatlity and length of it more than make up for it. The only big downside I could find with it is that from the start vn makes you think that there is voice acting throughout the entire story, but after day 2 it'll stop, it turns out the voice acting only plays during important sceens to the story which won't happen every day.

I've seen a lot of sex scenes (really, admittedly, I have), and, in general, I get into a scene and feel very comfortable being there, observing what's going on. These scenes are different, because they made me a little uncomfortable, but in a very good way. They make you feel guilty for intruding, which is something I don't think I've experienced before in a piece of media with NSFW content. It's impossible to get to those (pretty rare) scenes while also thinking of them as \"cheap.\" They're not cheap, and, honestly, when you get to them, your heart and mind are more prone to explosive reactions than whatever's in your pants.\n\nThat's all because of the really well-executed buildup, where, for hours, you get to see these diverse and human characters build relationships with each other, going from strangers to acquaintances to friends to lovers, over a reasonable and realistic span of time. The calendar system in this game contributes to this wonderfully: by knowing when during the year each and every scene takes place, your mind quietly fills in the gaps between interaction with all the mundane stuff that you know has to happen at some point, unlike in other VNs where (presumably) the protagonist(s) is living a normal life until all of a sudden *boom* stuff just happens and *keeps* happening for some length of time over which the story takes place.\n\nNot in Kindred Spirits. You are sat down back in your chair and told to -- if you'll allow me to paraphrase -- \"sit down, shut the fuck up, and settle down for the long haul. These things -- they take time.\"\n\nLikewise the atmosphere, visuals, soundtrack, and extra content are all fantastic. Would you ever have thought that a yuri DRAMA CD would ever be on anyone's localization plans? Well, they are with Kindred Spirits. When you're done with the game, you have plenty of extra material to go take a look at if the game really tickled your fancy.\n\nThe only regrettable thing is the lack of complete voice acting, but it's nothing deal-breaking. Voice acting is present for when it absolutely needs to be.

Yuri absolutely everywhere in this school from the teachers, to students, to the ghosts.\n\nThe story of this visual novel is [strike]fairly ordinary[/strike] pretty damn insane. At first you're playing through thinking \"Huh, this is just a school story where you play yuri matchmaker\". [b]Wrong.[/b] The reasoning behind the characters doing this is pretty strange and when you get towards the end you end up wondering \"Is she really agreeing to do this?! Who thought up this story, what were they on and where can I get some?\". And then, as you expect from a yuri visual novel everything turns out just fine no matter how screwed things seemed to be. There is a reason for the \"psychological horror\" tag being there; I don't agree with it being there but some people might be scared by some of the initial ghost stuff.\n\nThe characters are standard tropes. You have the hardworking-but-actually-quite-emotionally-frail character. The younger, stupidly cute childhood best friend. The sleepy one. The energetic one. The antisocial one and so on and so forth. However, as is typical of a good visual novel, they actually make decent use of these tropes. The story written around them is fantastic and makes it work.\n\nThe artwork is not that great. It isn't bad, but it isn't great. But it is uncensored, so there is that. What makes up for it is the great soundtrack (all apart from the intro that will deafen you the first time you listen to it because you are unprepared and have the volume up slightly too high). Quite a lot of electric guitar and I love it, which I honestly wasn't expecting from a VN of this subject matter. The music is only slow when it needs to be so you don't end up struggling to continue through what is supposed to be an intense scene because the music sucked. The OST for this is fantastic and I will sing its praises.\n\nSo overall, good story with standard tropes, mediocre artwork but a brilliant soundtrack that I occasionally will launch the game specifically for. Word of warning though, when you first launch it turn your volume down or you [i]will[/i] be caught off guard by the volume of the intro music.  Also, yes.

Each one is a yuri (lesbian) relationship--in fact, there are no male characters in the story at all. Most of the couples follow classic archetypes, but the actual execution is pretty unique for each. All the characters are extremely lovable, and the dynamics of their respective relationships and the challenges they face are well thought-out and seem very plausible (to me, anyway).\n\nThe best part about the way this novel is structured is that, as you get to know each of the characters, you also learn how they touch each others' lives. This makes the world feel more real, and gives a good sense of the larger school community of which these women are a part.\n\nGraphics are pretty normal for a visual novel (that is to say good).

It has a number of love scenes with nudity, so that can be a reason for some people to avoid it. Then the quantity of such scenes is relatively low and they do not appear until several hours in, so it's not for people who just want porn either. Furthermore, the majority of the main cast are lesbians, so people who have a problem with homosexuality would have a problem with this title. There isn't much of an engaging central plot or gameplay elements, so it also is not for people who need such things to enjoy a visual novel.\nAll that said, Kindred Spirits on the Roof is an upbeat yuri romance visual novel with a character-driven story that is very highly recommended to everyone who is interested in such things.\n\nWhat makes Kindred Spirits on the Roof feel so praiseworthy is the quality of its character writing. The main cast is relatively large and yet every character was relatable in some way and felt very believable. These characters have a good amount of depth and many undergo an appreciable amount of growth over the course of the story. The writing also does a fantastic job of conveying emotions. While not everyone will have the same experiences as those portrayed in this visual novel, the emotions that result from them are universal and this story presents them in a way that anyone can easily empathize with.\n\nUnlike most other romance visual novels which feature one protagonist with multiple potential love interests and routes, Kindred Spirits on the Roof instead presents a single story with multiple couples. This allows the reader to view all the different sorts of relationships portrayed within the visual novel without having to read through it multiple times. At certain points in the story, the main storyline will stop and the reader will be presented with a few different scenes to select that focus on the various couples from the point of view of one of the characters involved. The main storyline will not resume until all scenes for each couple are viewed. There are dialogue choices to make, but the story is ultimately linear and the choices only impact the dialogue immediately following the decision while all choices must be viewed to unlock every extra scene after the main story is cleared.\n\nAs far as overall presentation, Kindred Spirits on the Roof has a respectable level of quality. Each character has a decent number of sprites and even multiple outfits. There are also over 50 event images and the art looks pretty good overall. The soundtrack consists of 11 background tracks, an opening, an ending, and one insert song as well as instrumental versions of the opening, ending, and insert song. The quantity is not particularly impressive, but there are enough tracks to convey all the emotions needed and they are put to good use. I personally enjoyed listening to each track. Translated lyrics for the songs that have them can be found in the music player accessed from the scene selection screen. In addition to the main story and couple scenes, there are over 70 extra scenes that become available after completion and provide even more content. My time on Steam is a bit off since I had a habit of leaving the program open so I could listen to the music as I took care of chores and such, but I feel confident in saying I spent over 40 hours with this title.\n\nKindred Spirits on the Roof is among my favorite visual novels and the best I have read on Steam.

Fair enough!\n\nFact is, my feelings for this game are very, very mixed, but the reason I settled on giving it the negative rather than the positive were, believe it or not, mechanical reasons. And I don't mean the bug that forces you to quit the game every 10-20 minutes if you launch the game from Steam.\n\nIf the visual novel worked differently, I would probably recommend with much less hesitation, but because of how it works, not only am I instead giving it this negative review, but I may not even finish it (or at least not after a break) because I ended up just flat out getting fed up with it. \n\nIf that sounds strange, as I'm sure it does, then read on. \n\n[b]The Basics[/b]\n\nTruth be told, the writing in Kindred Spirits on the Roof isn't all that bad. The art, while not exactly incredible, is actually quite charming, and the characters are all look distinct from each other while still not having designs too outlandish or stereotypical. \n\nThe story is about a girl who comes to find she can see two ghosts who have fallen in love and who want to help other girls find love at their school. The girl comes to assist their quest, and slowly but surely helps a handful of couples get together and stay together over the course of the story, eventually finding love herself along the way.\n\nIt's light hearted, and those without much experience with how these types of stories are written or how homosexuality is viewed in Japan might experience some culture shock when reading some of the dialogue, but the game is overall pleasant in tone and develops all of its characters fairly and in a decent enough manner. \n\nOn the negative side, the soundtrack only seems to have a little over half a dozen or so songs (it feels like half that for the first few hours), and it reuses this same pair of peppy tracks in scenes where they really don't belong over and over again. The tracks that start to appear later in the game during more emotionally driven scenes are much more enjoyable and immersive, but that same pair of peppy songs always come in no matter what.\n\nLooking at these things, the game probably doesn't sound too bad, right?\n\nWell, if it was just this, I would be giving the thumbs up rather than thumbs down right here.\n\n[b]How Kindred Spirits \"Works\" and Why It's A Problem[/b]\n\nWhen you go into a visual novel, usually you expect to progress through the story from scene to scene, occasionally making choices along the way. If that sounds about right, as it so happens, there are actually exceptions to this that incorporate different types of gameplay or ways of moving from scenes: Kindred Spirits is in the latter category.\n\nIn Kindred Spirits, the player progresses by viewing scenes through a planner. First, they'll view scenes about the main story of the protagonist and two ghosts who want to help the students of the school they're haunting find love, and then progress in the main story is halted so that scenes from the perspective of the other characters can open up on your planner on the relevant days.\n\nAt first, this seems like a cool and novel system. You open up your planner, which serves as the game's menu, and not only look at any scene you've already seen, but progress through the story with a sense of time alongside you! As you start helping more and more couples, you'll have more and more scenes to go through between each portion of the main story, all taking place on different days, some taking place on the same days, which can really make your planner feel full and...\n\nAnd that is where one of the big problems with this system starts.\n\nI appreciate the system the game offers. The idea is interesting, and letting players see different perspectives this way could work, in theory.\n\nBut to me, it presented a big problem. As I see it, the problem could be taken in one of two ways: It makes problems for players who are either more interested in the main story and would like to keep following that, but it also makes it even worse for players don't care for whatever flavor of the day couple(s) the game insists you need to focus on before you can return to the protagonist. \n\nBecause you [i]can't[/i] proceed with the main storyline or even with [i]other couples[/i] further down the road until you see the scenes the novel wants you to see in more or less the order it wants you to see them. In a normal visual novel, this sort of thing is usually handled in a few ways: multiple routes, unlockable [i]optional[/i] side scenes, or just being flat out kinetic.\n\nBy Kindred Spirits giving players the planner, it makes them feel like they have a level of control that the game doesn't actually give them. I would almost say the planner not only seems to only exist to give players the [i]illusion[/i] of having input in the story, but I might even go as far as to say that it takes control away. \n\nThere were too many times where I found myself not enjoying the game because the game yanked me back into the planner and told me I needed to stop reading the story I might have been enjoying or invested in and go back and see what other characters were doing during this same period of time. The narrative had me jumping all over the game's different times, going back and forth from the end of the week to the start of it to earlier that month from various unrelated perspectives, and it created an experience that felt disjointed on more than one occasion. \n\nThis could all have been avoided if there were an option to let me come back to these scenes at my leisure, or just not get to see them if I progressed past the points they were relevant. Presenting and writing them in a way where I didn't have to keep jumping back and forth to the planner would have worked out, but as it is, it feels like the author wasn't able to make scenes that flowed together as well, and so they needed to create a system that could circumvent them having to have every scene naturally move into the next. The fact that many scenes include recaps far more lengthy than necessary of what's going on in that character's life only adds to this issue. \n\nPutting the scenes into entirely separate routes would have even worked better. It might have meant players wouldn't get the whole story in one sitting, but you would get fuller, more fleshed out experiences as opposed to the slapdash back and forths you may not even want to read about that you have here.\n\nDespite all of this, the fact is that [b]this isn't a problem if you can get invested in every scene of every couple[/b]. It isn't. But that also hinges on [i]also[/i] not wanting to see something that comes [i]after[/i] something that's included in \"every scene of every couple.\" \n\nIf that were the case with me, I would not be writing this in a negative light. Yet on more than one occasion, the game left the main story on a cliffhanger so that it could open up up to ten scenes for me to go through, some of which might be mundane, inconsequential, or ones that the main character was present for, meaning you don't actually get all that much from seeing the other side to begin with. It wastes your time doing that. \n\nYou may finish a scene and be ready to go on to the next, then find rather than another scene of the main story, you have to play as the other girls for a while. And that may be it for you. There is no rhyme or reason to it - sometimes you get many scenes of the main story before the break to see the other girls, sometimes only a few. \n\nThat may not be a problem for you, or it may be even worse for you than it was me, so with this in mind, here's my last thought on the matter:\n\n[b]Take this with a grain of salt[/b].\n\nRepeatedly getting yanked out of the main character's story for other ones without warning may have hurt this for me, but if it won't for you, consider this recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1470786394, "timestamp_updated": 1470786609, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.673031", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24772792": {"recommendationid": "24772792", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991171582", "num_games_owned": 594, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464615818}, "language": "english", "review": "Now that the entire series has concluded, I no longer know what I want to do with my life.", "timestamp_created": 1470640580, "timestamp_updated": 1470640580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24768951": {"recommendationid": "24768951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096026981", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499124275}, "language": "english", "review": "it was my first eroge, and DAMN, this game is wonderful.

Incredibly sincere and heartfelt, chock-full of infectious emotion that you simply can't help but feel as you read on. Simply a pleasure to read every single scene - from the amusements of daily life, to heart-thumping romance, anticipation, tense moments of drama and anger. Art is perfect for what it is: not overly cute (or \"moe\"), not overly serious, just some pleasantly designed characters that are easy to look at. The background music and theme song contribute to the game's atmosphere and are assigned to scenes appropriately. \n\nIt's the writing that makes this novel so good, though. The novel was fantastically tasteful, even for such a sexually-charged premise. In fact, the focus on building friendships/relationships provided so much characterization for every character that you feel like you know them as intimately as a close friend would - a rarity in yuri works. Even the erotic scenes contributed a lot to building the characters, which I enjoyed so much more than the very well-written and well-drawn scenes themselves.\n\nI have no idea how liberal the interpretation is from the original, but I honestly don't care. Liar-soft and the MangaGamer translators have done a stellar job writing a very well-made yuri story that, although far from novel or original, can speak to your heart and make it feel a whirlwind of emotion.\n\nAbsolutely worth every penny if you are a fan of the yuri genre. Thank you so, so much for this experience.\n\n--\n\nNotes:\n\nI've completed the game and have replayed it multiple times.

But despite my misgivings regarding potential fanservice and to-the-point meet-'n'-flick that all of the news sites seemed to expect of Steam's first uncensored game of \"frank depictions of sex\", this visual novel turned out to tackle issues related to struggling romance, including but not limited to struggling with sexuality, age gaps, and the idea of valuing other close relationships against romance, not to mention a social and fairly deep discussion on what it means to feel love. It is superbly well written and, at times, poignantly heartfelt; some of the dialogue comes off as awkward in a realistic way, in the scope of anime and manga, but it rarely ever feels cheesy. None of the referenced (meaning named and drawn) characters are cookie-cutter personalities; no obvious tsundere, dandere, yandere, whatever. Rather, they are all multifaceted, organic creations, and the underlying theme regarding the main character almost perfectly fits an Uncle Iroh quote: [spoiler]\"Sometimes the best way to solve your own problems is to help someone else.\"[/spoiler] I surprised myself by becoming very emotionally involved with the characters and their stories, and ended up reading through this VN twice consecutively, and plan to listen to the drama CDs (by which I mean read the subtitles) when #4 is subbed and when they go on sale. Honestly, the explicit scenes are definitely not the end goal; they're nice to have and certainly demonstrate the different levels of experience, clumsiness, and passion between the different couples, but ultimately I found myself wanting to know more about the relationships themselves. There are uplifting and embarassing moments, heated and heartbreaking moments, funny and eye-rolling moments.\n\nThe technical side is also very charming and fitting with the theme of high school romance. Only the more important scenes are voiced, which is a feature I tend to like since it gives an enhanced sense of emotion and climax to certain story arcs. Each main story arc has a number of side story arcs focusing on the individual couples intersecting it. In this case, the planner approach is a stroke of genius. My one complaint on this end would probably be the difficulty in attaining the extra scenes, which are unlocked after completing the game and through selecting different choices throughout the game (the choices are very minor and only affect these extra scenes and some immediate dialogue; the story itself is linear). The music, though somewhat limited in choice and looped a little poorly, is tasteful for the different emotional stings throughout the game, from simple and melancholic to upbeat and driving. My two personal favorites are \"Together\", played during pivotal scenes in each relationship, with its melody seeming to display a collapse of willpower and the sort of heartthrob one gets from a perfect relationship, and \"My Territory\", which is a somewhat cheeky tune without any particularly distinct mood that plays a lot during important character-building scenes involving the main character at home.\n\nIn short, [i]Kindred Spirits on the Roof[/i] is a well-written game that deals with relationships, longing, and the sort of struggles that arise because of each character's unique dealings and personal hurdles. It's a little expensive at $35, but I believe it to be well worth the price.\n\nMy personal relationship ranking: [spoiler]Yuna x Hina > Sasa x Umi > Sachi x Megumi > Seina x Miki > Tsukuyo x Kiri > Youka x Aki > Matsuri x Miyu[/spoiler]. Although, I have to say, it's pretty hard choosing.\n\nEdit: I write this at the end of my third time through the main story. Right now, I think my personal relationship ranking has changed to: [spoiler]Yuna > Seina > Megumi > Aki > Sasa > Kiri > Miyu[/spoiler], but it's still damn hard choosing an order.\n\nEdit 2: My, oh, my, the extras. I've played through the story three times now, but it's currently 2 in the morning because I've spent the last ten or so hours(!) playing through all of the extra scenes. In my previous two playthroughs, I thought I played them all, but apparently that was not the case. The extra scenes add multiple layers of depth to every character, and they tie the entirety of the story back together in satisfying and emotional ways, sometimes heartwarming, and sometimes heartbreaking.\n\nThat being said, this was the first time I encountered the 30-minute freezing glitch/bug. It certainly is annoying, but I did not seek a fix.

Everything will be... daijoubu.\n\ntl;dr - Anyone in the yuri shipping industry should invest. Good waifus.\n\nRight, so anyway, to keep this review short and sweet this VN is good.\nThe main story focuses on our protagonist, Yuna, who is spurred into action as an undercover matchmaker by two gay ghost girls to subtly meddle in the love affairs of gay girls in her all girl's high school. So the premise is fairly simple, but with solid writing and letting us see events from the different girls' perspectives (who have different personalities and are all fairly likeable) makes for an immersive, at times emotional, story. Of course, when combining several romantic stories some might appear more solid than the rest, but which one you like is for you to decide. \n\nBeing a visual novel the gameplay is not too interesting. You will be given choices here and there, but the story is linear and the only impact is some slightly changed dialogue and [spoiler] unlocking hidden scenes after completion [/spoiler].\n\n\"As for the music, it's okay.\" 10/10 - [insert-gaming-site-here]\nNo seriously, it's just ok. Some catchy tunes, but overall ok.\n\nThe artwork is fairly good. The character designs are cute and varied and fit the characters pretty well. Some of the sprites can be amusing at times. The backgrounds, though, are rather generic with a few exceptions. The CGs used for the \"intimate\" scenes are rather tame, but I really don't think they are meant as fap material either way. Strangely enough I would say they are cute, emotional and intimate first and foremost. As something to be remembered fondly. That being said, the CGs can sometimes appear to be somewhat, eh, weird when portraying characters from certain angles. I noticed one CG in particular, but overall it's fairly solid.\n\nYou will probably want to buy this one for the story and while it has a simple premise the execution is well done. I got a little hooked, or emotionally invested so to say, and continued through the night. Then I got a bright idea, and turned off the in-game music for a piano cover of Celine Dion's you-know-which-song during the climactic last scenes. And tried not to cry. But cried alot.

It got touching story, nice visuals and fine music.\n\nProtagonist is second year student Yuna in all girls high school. One day Yuna gains ability to see two ghosts girls (Kindred Spirits) on the roof of school building. Those two rope Yuna into helping girls in love, express theyr feelings and archive hapines together.\n\nGame is \"played\" by selecting scenes from calendar and leting them play out. Each month you first play out all scenes of main story (usualy staring Yuna and \"kindred spirits\") and then you get to explore events of same month from point of view of other characters. Unfortunetly you have to go thru all scenes for the month to be able to advance into next, unfortunetly because i didnt really care for some of the characters and i would happily skip theyr scenes.\n\nVoice acting is quite good but only about 1/5 of scenes are actualy voiced. To be honest, VN with that kind of price tag i would expect to be fully voiced so this was kind of disapointment.

If you want to read lesbian VN for the sex, just read SonoHana series instead.\noh and they never show vaginas in this VN\n\noverall rating : 8/10\nyuri is sweet, no?", "timestamp_created": 1465024908, "timestamp_updated": 1465024908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477358", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23371989": {"recommendationid": "23371989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285393088", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475178530}, "language": "english", "review": "I am not a fan of visual novels (VN) \u2013 I mean, all the ones I have taken an interest in were eroge (VN focused on sex), principally when we are talking about girls\u2019 love (GL) ones. Because of that, when I read about \u201cKindred Spirits on the Roof\u201d (KSotR) being available on Steam, and about it being an 18+ VN, I was very hesitant and I was not sure if I should buy it or not. I thought it was only for the fan service, once all the screenshots I have seen of KSotR were 18+ scenes.\n\nHowever, curiosity was stronger, so I decided on buying the game. First, because the plot seemed very interesting \u2013 with a bit of supernatural touch \u2013 and the most important factor: even being a VN, we do not have paths to follow or anything else: there are not lots of choices to make during the main route (MR) and anything we choose leads us to a common ending.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the beautiful soundtrack captivated me, even the ambience sounds, and I the care LiarSoft had while developing this VN caught my attention: all the characters have their own consciousness and their actor voices match their personality very well.\n\nI do not know if I should thank MangaGamer or LiarSoft or both for the vocabulary used in this game, but I have not read any profanity words during the MR AND in the sex scenes. About the sex scenes, I knew they were in this game \u2013 but they are soft and connected to the MR plot. I mean, there is not anything like \u201cHey, I like you, let\u2019s have sex!\u201d and all I could see was how strongly and deeply every character\u2019s feelings for another one grew and how it ended in their first time (having sex, of course).\n\nThe point is, sex is not the focus of this VN, and it is only the consequence of the plot \u2013 and I was very surprised because of it. We have the girls\u2019 act narrated so that all we can read is a beautiful poetry about their first time.\n\nAbove all, what impressed me the most was how focused on social aspects the game is. I mean, there are questions like \u201cDo you think homosexuality is okay?\u201d and \u201cIf I started dating a girl, how would society see us?\u201d, what made me reflect about our own social values and everything \u2013 we can not deny that homosexuality is still a taboo in many countries.\n\nI will finish my review here, because I do not want to give any spoilers or something like that.

Choices do matter, you unlock extra scenes with different choices. Gives you a reason to head through the game multiple times!\n\nI could not recommend this enough, I swear. \n\nSee, the thing with visual novels on Steam is that they're either lacking in story, lacking in emotional pull (for me, at least), or they're het (again, that's a problem with me, others may vary). So, as it stands, it's kinda difficult to find a good yuri VN on here.\n\nKindred Spirits on the Roof exceeded my expectations. I swear on my own life, this is one of the best VNs I've ever plread. It has characters that you can connect with, who all have their own emotions and worries and traits. I felt myself get attached to each and every one of them, all in a different way. The romance is believable, shockingly enough for a VN, and the more intimate moments don't really feel forced. Quick note: If you're looking for \"Oh girl-on-girl is hot\" then I suggest you look elsewhere, because there are far better smut VNs for you to play in that case (I recommend Sono Hanabira for that).\n\nI cried, I laughed, I smiled, I felt my face flush, I experienced more with this VN than I have...in a long while. Truly, one of the best I've played, and I am shocked to say that this surpasses Katawa Shoujo in my list of best VNs. This simply...hit me in a different way.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean this VN is perfect. The music can be slightly annoying I suppose, but it didn't bother me all that much. Also, you might feel like the story repeats itself sometimes, since you go back through to see the couples outside of the main branch with Toomi.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this enough, even at the price that it stands. 35 USD seems like a bit for a VN, but for quality...I feel quite confident in saying you won't find much better here on Steam.\n\nAlso, okonomiyaki is delicious, and I have this game to thank for sharing that with me.", "timestamp_created": 1463313080, "timestamp_updated": 1463322219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577013", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22984423": {"recommendationid": "22984423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093155666", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511929777}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright. So let\u2019s get this started.\n\nSo, a simple announcement: This game does not have \"steamy lesbian sex\", as many people think. Nor is it a fluff \u201cdoki-doki magical girl\u201d fest. At least not entirely. So if you want this game for either of those reasons, think twice. \n\nKindred Spirits, as a VL is really really nice. It's not a life changing game sure enough, but its filled with a good representation of \"Girls Love\" problems in a academic life style. I find the game long enough to expose and develop the whole story of the main characters and the different couples, and short enough you can play for a good amount of time without getting bored. (I know, it says I have about 5 hrs., but that\u2019s because I had to run it outside steam. More on that later.)\n\nKS has a solid and heart-warming story with interesting characters that develop nicely as the game goes on. No character ever becomes blurred in the sidelines, and they all have enough screen time and importance to be worthy of development. The game exposes several scenarios, each represented by a different girl, and by a different couple. Other than the 2 ghosts, the game is very faithful to (what I can imagine) realistic problems someone in that situation can have, without going too much on fantastic territory. Even the ghosts have problems that (if so the case\") ghosts could have. Then again, I\u00b4m not a girl who fell in love with another girl, so...\n\nAll in all,  Kindred Spirits on the Roof is a medium-sized game with good exposure, heart-warming and hilarious situations, down to the ground thinking and reactions and interesting characters. If I had to say something bad, it would be that two certain situations are a bit to abrupt for certain characters. [spoiler] The sex scenes come way too fast and way too hard, making one or two characters feel a bit out of character. Then again, that's what happen when you get horny. Boys and Girls alike.

The shortest review I can possibly give would be one word: Masterpiece. However, I feel that such a short, generic review would not do this beautiful story justice. I also feel that it would be irresponsible of me to give spoilers to the plot, as it is best experienced for yourself as you play through the game, so instead, I will try to take the middle road between brevity and gushing over this wonderfully touching story.\n\nFor starters, if you are looking at this game simply because it is a yuri visual novel and you're expecting to get some good wank material out of it, you may want to move along. Yes, there are several sex scenes in the game. However, they are NOT written to entice or excite the reader. Rather, they are written realistically, in the perspective of the couples experiencing their first times together. They are not pornographic, but wonderfully, touchingly emotional. \n\nThe same can be said for the yuri romances throughout the game. They are not played up and fetishized, but are instead written in a sweet, pure way, genuinely fleshing out the feelings that the characters have for each other in a realistic way, as well as bringing up the worries of living in a traditional society that would see something wrong with them for feeling the way that they do. \n\nAll the characters are written fantastically, each having their own unique personalities, even if some of them do fall into some old character tropes from anime. There's the always sleepy (but surprisingly perceptive) Miyama Nena, the cuteness-obsessed Tsurigimine Kiri, and the air-headed, rock obsessed Koba Youka, to name just a few. While some of the characters seemed a little flat to me the first time they were introduced, the game does a fantastic job of fleshing them all out.\n\nOn top of the excellent writing, the soundtrack and cg are also top-notch. I did get a little annoyed with the fact that the music in the game doesn't loop, even though the majority of the music seems to be made in a way that it could loop. Instead of looping or stopping, it just fades out, then starts again from the beginning. However, this is a minor complaint, particularly when compared to the quality of the music itself. The cg for the characters and scenes is also fantastic, drawn very smoothly, but with just the slightest hint of sketchiness to the lines, giving it a sort of innocent feel that fits in with the overall tone of the game.\n\nIn short, if you're here because you have a fetish for yuri, don't bother.

Not exactly a game, you click through the dialogue and enjoy the story.\n\nPros:\n+yuri themed\n+heart warming romance\n+decent soundtrack\n+good character designs\n+good setting\n+Steams first (I believe) 18+ game/VN\n\nCons:\n-the art isn't great\n-it isn't fully voiced, only during certain moments\n-some of the characters romances are boring\n\nWhat I really like about this VN is that its a yuri. I'm a sucker for a good yuri VN so I'm really glad that this got picked up by mangagamer, and that I can get it on steam. Probably my favorite part about Kindred Spirits is the main romance, which is between Yuna and Hina. I like Yuna as a protagonist for a couple reasons. Firstly its her design, its nothing amazing or unique but I'm really attached to her appearance. Next its her general character/personality. At the beginning she explained how she wasn't terribly social and always ate lunch on the roof, which I can completely sympathize with. She changes as the story progresses but she's still likeable.\n\nThe music is pretty nice as well, nothing amazing but there are a few pieces that stick out for me.\n\nAnother thing that I didn't realize I liked until I finished the main route was the system you play the events with. Its like a calender the days have events. Its pretty nice so that if you want to replay certain scenes you won't have to go through a wall of text to get to it or have 20 different saves.\n\nThe demerits are there, but aren't enough to make me dislike the game. The biggest is that it isn't fully voiced, its only voiced when there's a CG or during special events. Its not a terrible thing but it helps with the mood when certain scenes are voiced. Another issue is just personal interest, about half the characters and their romances are boring to me. Its not a big deal but I skim over their events more often than not.\n\nAnother kind of big issue is that its mostly a kinetic VN. There are choices but they don't impact the story at all, and the protagonist only ends up with one girl. It would have been great if you could hook up with the other characters too, especially since the protag becomes friends with them and I can see how a romance would blossom.\n\nFinal verdict: an 8/10, I'd absolutely recommend it if you're a yuri fan", "timestamp_created": 1461317332, "timestamp_updated": 1461317332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22493450": {"recommendationid": "22493450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198293833591", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462350626}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome game, i didn't get bored at all, i highly recommend it, if you are into visual novels and yuri", "timestamp_created": 1460959950, "timestamp_updated": 1460959950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22491475": {"recommendationid": "22491475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077732442", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481162125}, "language": "english", "review": "Play this and let your impending midterms fade away...", "timestamp_created": 1460946569, "timestamp_updated": 1460946569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511650", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22488515": {"recommendationid": "22488515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048276017", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 16071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462773127}, "language": "english", "review": "I have no words to describe this game other than amazing. i seriously can't think of anything profound to say, so just buy the game if you like visual novels, romance, or yuri. or for the perverted, yes there is nudity (near the end).", "timestamp_created": 1460931876, "timestamp_updated": 1460931876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22460492": {"recommendationid": "22460492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116913129", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466590569}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game!

Don't get me wrong, Yuri's good, heck I love Yuri. I don't want to brag but I only needed to rest for an hour every time the girls kissed in Sakura Trick. Anyway, usually Yuri VN's are kinda too straight forward. I've seen many Yuri NV's in my time and I gotta say, it goes like this:\n\n- Talking\n- Kissing\n- Y U R I S E X\n- The end\n\nKindred Spirits on the Roof isn't like this (To all who are dissapointed that it isn't like this, shame on you, and me.) The characters are lovable, memorable and down right sweet and you'll have to rest for a whole day just to get your blood sugar in normal levels. The art feels kinda 'home'-ish, if that's a correct adjective to use for art. It certainly is good don't get me wrong.\n\nThe characters are well made, specially the main character. Usually when you see a girl in a VN you think \"I want to see that girl nekkid doing hot lesbian action with another girl\" (Is it just me? Really? Fuck you guys.) But the MC of Kindred Spirits left me with the feeling of \"I want to be friends with this kind of person.\" But the latter still applies, that's why we have the MC's friend Ano. Ano is a Best.\n\nNow for the negatives.\n\nThe only negative I honestly could find right now (Since I haven't finished the game yet) is the music. Again, don't get me wrong the music is good, makes me want to jump around and frolic in the fields of Japan with my lesbian friends, but god damn the LOOPING is just damn horrible. You play the VN then the jumpy uppity music plays, and you're so happy, the characters are happy, the gods of Yuri are happy, then the music comes to an end and you think \"Oh shit is it gonna be serious? Shit is this shit gonna hit the fan?? Don't ya fucking pull a CLANNAD on me ya fucking bastards!\" Then the Music plays again and everyone is happy again.\n\nAll and all it's pretty gud.

There is enough variety for anyone to find characters to their liking and while I liked some characters a lot more than the rest, I did not hate any of them. Even the teacher/student pairing, made all the weirder because the teacher looks like she is 10, did not grate on me like I tought it would, mostly because every character has her time to shine and her own quirks.\nMore than anything, I felt like this game perfectly captured the nature of teen drama as I remember it. How even the most insignificant of exchanges can be misunderstood and blown out of proportion, not because anyone is mean, but simply because everyone expects others to just understand \"obvious\" stuff via pure empathy.\nThat said, in my teens, things did not resolve so systematically well for everyone... but here the happy endings go a long way to compensate for the sad moments (the whole premise is about ghosts of long dead high school girls who never experienced love in their short lives and  want to so that they can move on... yeah, want some fries with your angst?).\nAs for the sex scenes, they are more erotic than pornographic and mostly well built up into each couple's narratives.

The story is basic but always keeps you wanting to read more.  I actually couldn't sleep until I finished and that doesn't happen to me with visual novels.  The characters are all endearing although 3 of them I didn't much like until the end but with a cast of about 16 or so characters 3 isn't that bad.  For a VN of this nature they also avoid using tropes to limit characters.  I mean the tropes exist but not one character I found to be limited by them.  The romances were fairly believable as well.  They showed some of the bad but didn't rely on soap opera style exagerations to show it.  Also the couples run the gamut from serious and dramatic problems to just gut busting comedy at times, but none of it feels forced.  Two of the couples in particular I always look forward to because they are funny but it was the kind of funny I've seen in real relationships.  A must read even if girl's love isn't your cup of tea.

Being a complete noob to Visual Novels, I had expected something that would keep me entertained for 10, maybe 15 hours -- but as you, dear reader, can see above, this game has kept me occupied far beyond what I had dared to assume.\n\nIn my opinion, the charm of this game lies in the attention to detail that went into fleshing out all its quirky characters. Some of them may fall into well-known cliches, but they do so in a manner that is endearing rather than grating, and thanks to the way their personalities interact with one another, all of them are deeper than just a collection of shallow categories.\n\nI also really like the art style of this game, for the soft colors and realistic proportions are nice change from the ubercute semi-chibis you see in other VNs, and together with the game's setting and the characters' inexperience in matters of love, it weaves a realistic environment where it becomes easy to feel with and root for those poor girls who are understandably overwhelmed by these blooming feelings.\n\nKindred Spirits is NOT a \"porn game\", and whilst this may come as a disappointment to some, I'd say it is actually one of its greatest strengths. \"Fan\"service such as pantyshots or ridiculously exaggerated breasts are thankfully absent here. Make no mistake: in spite of its spicy yuri scenes (tasteful nudity, in the words of the developer), this is ultimately a game about emotions, and you may find yourself laughing or crying with the characters as the story progresses. The writer as well as the translator deserve appreciation for what they have crafted here, and it seems to show in how popular the game has already become -- so much so that it seems to develop into its own franchise, already with 4 Drama CDs soon to be released on Steam.\n\nIt took me a little bit to get used to the calendar you use to select and play/unlock the game's scenes, but I've quickly discovered its value in how it makes it easier to assume the role of different characters experiencing the same scene. I'm not one of those players who hunt down every single \"route\" they unlock with different choices (I play through a story once, and that's my headcanon), but even so I was amazed by the sheer amount of content. Even after the main story is over, there's a ton of \"extra\" scenes that provide additional insight into the side characters, answering questions that may have been left unanswered so far.\n\nPROs:\n+ *very* likeable characters with realistic teenage worries\n+ amazing artwork (including the chibis!)\n+ (mostly) superb voice acting, in particular for some of the more emotional scenes\n+ lots of content (extra scenes, song lyrics)\n+ DEM FEELS (slice-of-life, slapstick, romantic comedy, drama)\n\nCONs:\n- few choices (I'd almost classify KSotR as a \"Kinetic Novel\", though this did not detract from it being crazy fun)\n- not consistently voiced (a few additional scenes may have benefited from voiceovers)\n\nYouTuber Nixxi is hosting an incredibly funny LetsPlay here, though I greatly recommend only watching it after actually having played the game yourself so that you benefit from fully developed attachments to the characters that are being made fun of: https://www.youtube.com/user/VnixxiR/videos\n\nThere is also a petition to turn Kindred Spirits into an anime: https://www.change.org/p/liar-soft-make-kindred-spirits-on-the-roof-into-an-anime\n\nFinishing thoughts: I'm glad I purchased this game, and I'm glad to see it expand into a full franchise.

Their relationships went in ways I didn't expect but definitely had me grinning as they developed. Nothing about it feels rushed or awkwardly forced. It all seems really genuine even with the realism they seem to add to it (a crush that starts out entirely one sided, age difference, etc.).\n\nIn terms of content, it definitely has quite a lot in my opinion. Even after you finish the \"main\" story line, side stories are unlocked that show the other girl's feelings and their perspective. It's also important to point out that while Yuna (the protag) has a large role in aiding the start of their relationships, you also see how these girls come together from their own perspectives. With the side stories, you see what the other person was thinking at the time and how they were feeling, so in a way you get to see both sides. That was utterly amazing, honestly.\n\nAs for the nudity, none of it feels perverted or done in the purpose of trying to get more views/customers. They arrive to that point naturally in their relationship, and not every couple goes as far as some. Even then, everything feels warm and loving. These scenes were made to show their feelings for each other, rather than to just draw naked girls, which is a definite bonus.\n\nFinal thoughts: While the price can be a bit... well, pricey... for what they're offering you, I honestly think it's definitely deserved and worth it.

If I was asked to describe 'Kindred Spirits on the Roof' in terms of my anime experiences, I would have to say that it reminds me of a cross between \" Kuttsukiboshi\" and \"Sakura Trick\" mixed in with a cross between \"Maria Sama ga Miteru\" and \"Strawberry Panic\".  \n \nThe two ghosts - or 'Kindred Spirits' as they prefer to be called, may as well have been drawn from the likeness of Sachiko and Yumi. Not to mention, Matsuri and Miyu - the track and field sempai - look an awful lot like Sei and Y\u014dko. This led me to believe that the design choice may not have been entirely unintentional. Considering how big a part \"Maria Sama ga Miteru\" has had in the Yuri/Shoujo ai genre it doesn't really surprise me. In fact, it almost felt as if the game was paying homage to these roots, expanding on them and going into an area that was not possible 10 years ago.  \n \nI very rarely play a game through more than once \u2013 feeling as if once I've done the main story there are too many other games out there to try so no need to do all the \"side stuff\". Kindred Spirits on the Roof however is a visual novel that made me want to not only experience all the \"side stuff\", but made me want to re-experience it again and again - in the same manner as one would re-read parts of a favourite  book or rewatch parts of a movie that left an impression.  \n \nAs flaws are part of any review, I do feel obligated to touch upon them. Although, in my opinion, the main flaw here is simply the lack of voice acting. While all the main scenes have voice acting \u2013 it would've been great to see it in the side stories as well. The voice acting in this game is so exceptional that it's truly a shame that there's not more of it.  \n \nIn conclusion, if you're looking for an experience that will put a smile to your face and make you feel good about life, love and the human race in general \u2013 then look no further. Kindred Spirts on the Roof will do just that \u2013 and more. In my 100 + hours with the game I got the 'full clear' icon with all the extras unlocked \u2013 yet I'm still keeping it in my favourites so that I can come back to it whenever I need a 'pick-me-up'.", "timestamp_created": 1458996185, "timestamp_updated": 1458996534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22051343": {"recommendationid": "22051343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091223830", "num_games_owned": 560, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462085949}, "language": "english", "review": "This was my first dating sim that I have played and I gotta say I hope that others can measure up this because it was pretty amazing.

There's not really any other way to put it. I like the medium in theory, but the vast majority of what you can find is just bad. Pacing in particular is a problem, followed up by tendency to throw in reprehensible content.\n\nKindred Spirits is novel right off the bat because something actually happens in the first hour. While it's not immune to pacing problems, Kindred Spirits' plot moves along fairly regularly, aided by the device of the planner breaking the story into discrete chunks. Another thing that stops Kindred Spirits from feeling like it's stalling out is the fact that it follows a handful of couples, so someone's story is always advancing meaningfully whatever you're reading.\n\nThe couples are what is going to make it for you if you like the game. The characters are all unique and fairly well written, and the game for the most part does a really good job of differentiating the characters' internal monologues when there's a scene from their perspective. Yuna is an interesting character and one who I feel a lot of kinship with, but seeing the antics of the various couples as they fall in love and strive to start a relationship is bulk of the draw.\n\nWell, I guess there's one other potential draw. The elephant in the room.\n\nAccording to one of the translators, sexual scenes are only roughly 6% of the script. Having read all of it, I'm surprised it's even that high- and if sex scenes are 6% of the script, then things like \"nngh\" and \"ahn\" have to be at least 3%. I'm not a huge fan of sex scenes in these kind of games to begin with, but if you're going to have them Kindred Spirits' ones are fairly good. They do a decent job of making the people actually seem like teenagers who have no idea how to bone, and the CGs never get more explicit than a few anime tiddies. Unless you're incredibly morally offended by euphemistic reference to heavy petting you'll probably be fine- it's not like people are breaking out the dildos for a 50 page orgy.\n\nOne complaint you can level (aside from the pacing and editing, which, while WAY above VN standard, is still a little long sometimes)  is the \"extra scenes\". Once you finish the main story, you're only about half way done. Various scenes pop up all over the planner, and the main way they're unlocked is making choices in the main game. This is sort of a hassle, so I'd recommend just going back and choosing the other option every time you see a choice to get it out of the way early. The extra scenes are nice, but they're where the game threatens to outstay its welcome. Personally I was charmed enough to enjoy it right up until the final extra scene, but I suspect a lot of people will be done about halfway through the extras.\n\nAlso, the game makes you think it might have alternate routes, but that's a lie, choices only affect the extra scenes. Which is a shame, but there's nothing wrong with there being one story you want to tell.\n\nIn summary, Kindred Spirits is a cute little game that's a lot of fun.

soured my entire experience with it. However for the most part I really love it. The couples are a bit hit and miss but they're clealry designed try and tick as many boxes as possible and theres a couple for everyone I think. The game looks and sounds good, though its resolution options (or total lack therof) are a bit annoying and I came across a reoccurring bug where the game wold freeze after about an hour playtime, though I suspect this is more a harware problem and not the real probelm i have with this game.\n\nThe problem is that what you want, doesnt matter in this game. This game is about as linear as it gets and any choices you make are at best completely pointless and at worst simply there to give you the illusion you're participating. Now heres the real kicker. The game has a romance involving the player character, which you get to influence in absolulely no way whatsoever. A fact i learned after i made a choice the i thought loigically, would almost certianly cause a different outcome and it having apparenly no effec and never being brought up again.\n\nHonestly finding out that I had no agency in this world was shocking. The game's own presentation and genre had made me think that, of course being able to pick who the protagonist ended up with, that was a given. Instead the game had presented me with a choice that caused me to anticipate that I would get to pick a romance and given me idea who i would get to pick between and I in my enthusiam latched onto it. But I latched onto the wrong character, the one who though i prefered i suddenly wasnt allowed to romance. I was never supposed to romace them but I thought I would be able to and as it seemed more and more like I really wasnt ever going to get to romace the character I had over the course of ten hours set my heart on the more I resented the other character for not being her. \n\nNow you may be thinking. \"That's a bit entitled surely? If the developers want to tell a paticular story they're allowed to.\" Which I agree with wholeheartedly. But it brings me to my second problem with this aspect of the game, which is that I find this romace to be uncharacterisically uncompelling, In fact I find the inital premise behind the romance slightly offputting being about as close to incest as you can get without it actually being incest and its not like this is a par of the game that can be skipped or skimmed over as its the main storyline.", "timestamp_created": 1457668514, "timestamp_updated": 1457668514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21750101": {"recommendationid": "21750101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011015009", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490300337}, "language": "english", "review": "It's almost bittersweet that I've reached the end of this so relatively quickly, though that has much more to do with spending the entire week dedicated to finishing through it.\n\nA couple of things to note first off. I think the price-tag is still a bit steep, and I'd highly recommend watching this like a hawk for sales if you're truly interested in experiencing it. The demo will give you about the first 2 hours of story and introduce all of the characters. You can even carry over your save state from the demo since they're all held in simple files.\n\nThe other issue I've run into was performance. There's nothing about this VN that should cause stutters or lag, but I found consistently that I'd get about 20 minutes into a session and suddenly text speed would halve and the minimal on-screen movement of sprites would diminish even further than that. This problem might be localized, and it's ultimately a minor gripe, but I figured I'd give the heads up.\n\nThat said, I do highly recommend checking this out, especially if you're a fan of romance in any way. There's a lot to get into and there's a surprising amount to digest. The base game covers about 21 hours and the extra content delivers as many or more scenes in a smaller format for 5 hours.\n\nNot a single moment is wasted driving the narrative. There are multiple points of comedy (Ano is an absolute trip), there are chances to cry, and there are points of pure catharsis. This novel is a bit unique in that sex drives the narrative, yet is never solely the focus. It would be unfair to say the erotic scenes don't serve their own purpose in character development, but they are simply moments where everything comes to a head.\n\nI think the thing that impressed me the most in this is how organic the development of the main character is. I won't tell much, but it's very clear from the beginning that Yuna is not living entirely as herself. Her story perhaps more than any of the others is worth being read and appreciated.\n\nReally, the thing that will make you enjoy this game is the sheer realism behind it in spite of its crazy, spirit-driven premise. A wide range of situations reach all of the characters, from the couple that have been in love for years but have had to hide it, to a new, entirely taboo affair between a teacher and student, to a 2 out of 3 couple that overthinks absolutely everything.\n\nIf it were any use, I'd write paragraphs on paragraphs about the merits of each individual character, and that's really where the biggest strength of Kindred Spirits on the Roof lies.\n\nIn summation, when two ghosts tell you to make girls have sex with each other, you'd best damn listen.

I like visual novels, like CLANNAD. This game appears to be the first uncut yuri visual novel on steam, but it isn't too graphic. The price worried me a bit, but I made up my mind and decided to get it. I didn't expect this game to be good. I was really into the story, and I found myself playing 18 hours straight. I would never play a game for that long in one session.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n+ A total of 7 romantic couples\n+ Has uncut imagery *wink* *wink* *nudge* *nudge*\n+ The pacing is good, not too quick, but not too slow\n+ Music is good\n+ Gallery\n+ Planner that gives you the days when something happens between characters\n+ Extra scenes after the game is completed\n+ Replay scenes over and over again *wink*\n+ [b]Yuritopia[/b]\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n- Not many choices/ Choices don't affect outcomes (Counter Pro: It appears choices do matter in the extra scenes)\n- Only one ending\n- Voice-acting only in important scenes\n- The choices you make only have extra dialogue\n\n[h1] In Conclusion [/h1]\n  It was really tough for me to say bad stuff about the game. I just couldn't think of anything wrong with it. I finally completed the game, but I felt weird. I just wanted to stop; and forget all about this game, so I can play it again.

The actual sexual content is almost incidental, although I would still recommend for adults only.\n\nWhile the game is expensive, it is also quite lengthy for a single route with bonus content, between 30 and 40 hours.  Normally I like to read for just a few hours at a time, to let a story marinate and let me immerse in its setting and characters and situations.  Although each scenario is relatively short, there's always something happening or something to look forward to or some reason to read just one more!  After the main route is completed the game opens up bonus scenarios equal to a small fandisk, which is good because no fandisks were made so this is all there is.  I wish there had been more of Hina's \"wawawa\" moments, but what there is is very good.\n\nThe music is suitably cute with a decent variety of tracks.  Early on they got repetitive, and the way they faded out then got loud again when they looped to the beginning was kinda distracting.  Days later though I will sometimes hear them sneak into my consciousness at relevant times.\n\nThe characters are central to the experience, and everything about them is spot-on: their basic design, art, poses, expressions, outfits, actions, and voices are all perfectly suited to them.  Sure some of them are a little stereotypical or tropic, but the story at least gives reasons for them to be the way they are.  The characters share moments that are cute, sweet, touching, and occasionally surprisingly hilarious, all while staying in character.  I couldn't help but cheer for all of them.\n\nTwo characters deserve special mention:  Hina is the most adorable ever, and Yuna's voice actress nailed it with a sweet-sounding voice I could listen to forever.\n\nWhen it's all over, you're left with an ending theme by Rita that will keep me nostalgic for a long time to come.\n\nSachi-san, Megumi, Yuna, every day with you was so much fun.\n\n[spoiler]Yuna, I hope you can meet them again someday.\n\nSayonara.

Seriously that's what the internet is for so don't waste your money.\n\nI fully expected something like that from this game, just another excuse to ogle at fictional girls. To my surprise it was not like that at all, at least in the time I've played it thus far. No gravity breaking tities, no brain-less bimbos smutting up the place, no (well, almost no) hyper exagerated archtypes. It's almost as if Kindred Spirits wouldn't be a typical anime *gasp*\n\nJoking aside there is an interesting story here to enjoy, unless you don't like visual novels then see the above note, and the characters I feel are well written so that everyone actually becomes a character and not a one note prop to move the story. Best of all this is an actual game with choices. I don't know how the choices affect the later story, but it does give some agency to the audience which I think too many types of these games forget. The story is told different angles so I also didn't feel stuck with the main character through the whole ride. A nice thing also is that I don't think the game makes blanket statements about homosexuality, there are characters who question such pairings, maybe not enough to be more realistic but enough that the audience knows this isn't a completely common thing.\n\nThe one problem I have with the game is the voice acting. I am one of those anime fans who prefers anime subbed rather than dubbed which this game is, so if you have a problem with japanese voice acting that is something to note. My problem comes from the voices they chose for some of the characters. Everyone has a VA to them so that's nice, but some of them sound like kids in elementary or middle school. That's my thoughts though.\n\nIt's a nice game with a good story and more character than a stereotype anime. If you enjoy these things then this might be up your alley.\nBottom line: Good characters help make a good story, bad characters help it become porn.", "timestamp_created": 1456771076, "timestamp_updated": 1456771076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21541978": {"recommendationid": "21541978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097433538", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456718738}, "language": "english", "review": "I came for the yuri and stayed for the surprisingly good story and well developed characters.

It also comes closer to the real world of LGBT-land than typical yuri stories; the word \"lesbian\" (or the Japanese equivalent, anyway) is actually tossed around, some characters worry about coming out of the closet to their families and friends, etc.. If you like visual novels and you like slice-of-life romance stories, Kindred Spirits is about as good as it gets.

The R18 stuff is not much, with 1-2 CG per pairing with nothing much going on, along with conveniently placed stuff to cover the private part. You can see nipples, but that's about it. So again, don't buy this if you're looking for the R18 content\n\nIf you're not just looking for that, then maybe wait for a sale or something. The price is a bit daunting indeed, but for me personally, i did not regret buying at launching discount, at all.\n\nGameplay:\nNothing much, it's just your usual VN. The kicker here is that everything is already predetermined, so no matter what choice you make, the ending is still the same. The choice however would unlock more extra stuff for you to see after the main game complete, which makes the playtime more than worth it. Unlike usual VN where you go in a straight line, this VN enables you to go parallel, meaning there's one main story, and several side story that you happens at the same time in the timeline. So you'll be playing as several characters, seeing it from their own perspective, which makes the depth of the story really hits home. Of course, this can leads to several moment where some story ended up on some not-so-likeable note and you need to wait for the story to progress to see the continuation. So far it's not a problem to me, but it's definitely not something i'm used to.\n\nStory:\nIf you're buying this not for the story, then you missed out a hell lot. The story here is well written and nicely paced, and with the unique cast of pairings, well maybe not so unique, but some is, you can't help but like most of the cast. This is not your perfect utopia where everything went smoothly, which means every character have their own conflict to deal with, adding more realism to the story. This game is one of the few games that actually managed to make myself cry, despite being a R18 yuri VN. Overall, i cannot reccomend the story enough. Definitely a must buy if you enjoy School Romance and Yuri genre.\n\nOh and the supernatural part do comes in and out of the story, but in the end it doesn't really affects the realism.\n\nGraphics:\nYour standard VN style CG and sprites. Can't really comment much on this part, but if you like what you see in the screenshots, you won't have any trouble liking the art-style. The R18 CG is pretty well done though, i must admit. Definitely more detailed than the screenshots provided.\n\nSound:\nThe VA is great. Every voice fits with the character, and the acting quality is really good. You won't be disappointed with the VA quality. What you might be disappointed with might be with the amount of voiced lines. [b]NOT ALL LINES ARE VOICED[/b]. All the main point of the story is voiced however, so in the end it's not much of a problem. The R18 section is voiced, so yeah.\n\nThe soundtrack is nice and all, but there's nothing more to it. It fits the mood well, but i won't go as far as to reccomend it. The OST isn't so bad either, but yeah, just decent. One of the insert song was quite good however, which i would reccomend listening to it.\n\n\nTL;DR:\nYou like good storytelling? You like yuri? Buy it, it's worth the money. Don't buy it if you're in it for the R18 stuff.\n9/10\n\nP.S.

She quickly becomes their (slightly unwilling) accomplise in bringing other girls in her school together.\nIn order of best to worst from my experience:\nArt: 10/10\nI havent seen a game of any kind in so long where the artist actually took the effort to make different costumes and colors for a whole variety of situations. In particular, I love the style <3. It really helps to bring to mind the feeling of a girl in love.\nMusic: 9/10\nThe track isn't very large, but what is there is well made and pleasant to listen to without being too overwhelming or distracting. Only problem I really had was that the tracks didn't loop at all.\nStory: 8/10\nThe premise of the plot is actually...kind of orginal? It definitely wasn't something I'd seen before. Of course, in execution, the story became a little more mundane, but it was still enticing to read from beginning to end, and I loved the ending.\nCharacters 7/10\nMost of the characters are well developed, but they tend towards fairly typical archetypes common in japanese culture, so if you're used to that, you might get bored of their antics quickly.\n\nAs for stuff that can't easily be graded:\n+ Game length: for me, I cleared the main story in about 20 hours, but there's more for you to do afterwards, and I estimate about atleast another 5-8 hours of gameplay is left. Not bad at all.\n- UI: While the UI is not cluttered, It is instead compact and fairly complicated for a VN, including far more visual buttons than is common. On that note, the options is fairly cluttered, even if everything is labeled.\n\nAll in all, I think the game is almost worth its full price, which is not something I'd say about most VN's, especially on steam. Even at 10% off, I think this game is worth buying.\n\nTL;DR : 11/10 would yuritopia again", "timestamp_created": 1456174277, "timestamp_updated": 1456174277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560868", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21385971": {"recommendationid": "21385971", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155385541", "num_games_owned": 974, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457618729}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u767e\u5408\u63a7\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u597d\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6f2b\u957f\u7684\u7b49\u5f85\u540e\u7ec8\u4e8e\u5728\u53d1\u552e\u540e\u7b2c\u4e00\u65f6\u95f485\u5927\u6d0b\u628a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u5c0f\u8bf4\u6dfb\u5230\u4e86steam\u5e93\u4e2d\n\u6211\u6ca1\u8bb0\u9519\u7684\u8bdd\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u51e0\u5e74\u524d\u5c31\u6709\u4e86\uff0c\u5f53\u5e74\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u73a9\u53d1\u73b0\u963f\u91ce\u7ebf\u88ab\u5220\u6389\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u6c14\u7684\u6012\u6454\u9f20\u6807\u6012\u5220\u6e38\u620f\u7136\u540e\u8d76\u7d27\u6253\u4e86\u4e00\u76d8cod\u6d88\u6d88\u6c14\n\n\u6211\u73a9\u7684\u65e5\u5f0fgal\u4e0d\u591a\uff0c\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u65f6\u95f4\u90fd\u82b1\u5728\u4e86RTT\u6e38\u620f\u548cFPS\u6e38\u620f\u4e0a\uff0c\u51e0\u5e74\u524d\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u73a9\u767e\u5408\u7075\u5176\u5b9e\u662f\u62b1\u7740\u4e00\u79cd\u5f88\u90aa\u2640\u6076\u3002\u3002\u3002\u54b3\u54b3\uff01\u4e0d\u8fc7\u73a9\u4e86\u51e0\u7ae0\u540e\u6211\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5267\u60c5\u76f8\u5f53\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8352\u5e9f\u4e86\u597d\u51e0\u5929\u7684FPS\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u5c31\u50cf\u6211\u4e0a\u9762\u63d0\u5230\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u963f\u91ce\u7ebf\u88ab\u5220\u6389\u4e4b\u540e\u6211\u5c31\u597d\u51e0\u4e2a\u661f\u671f\u6ca1\u518d\u78b0\u8fc7\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u5c31\u8fd9\u4e48\u5e9f\u4e86\uff0c\u540e\u6765\u4e8c\u5468\u76ee\u624d\u8865\u5168\n\u73b0\u5728\u7b97\u4e0asteam\u3002\u3002\u3002\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u7b2c\u4e09\u5468\u76ee\u4e86\u5427\n\n\u753b\u98ce\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\u86ee\u5e72\u51c0\uff0c\u53ef\u662f\u6709\u51e0\u5f20CG\u660e\u663e\u753b\u5d29\u4e86\uff0c\u89d2\u8272\u77ac\u95f4\u6389\u4ef7\uff0c\u8fd8\u597d\u53ea\u662f\u51e0\u5f20\u800c\u5df2\n\u97f3\u4e50\u86ee\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u98ce\u683c\u5f88\u6e05\u65b0\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ed9\u4e2a\u597d\u8bc4\n\n\u8981\u8bf4\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u6211\u5c31\u662f\u5e0c\u671b\u5b98\u65b9\u80fd\u5728steam\u4e0a\u5438\u5b8c\u91d1\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u628a\u963f\u91ce\u7ebf\u8865\u4e0a", "timestamp_created": 1456148873, "timestamp_updated": 1456148873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.734161", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21385081": {"recommendationid": "21385081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078424269", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502847510}, "language": "english", "review": "Mm.

Add in some great slice-of-life moments that make you laugh, smile, and empathize. It's that type of game. I think I could recommend it to just about anyone who enjoys sweet slice-of-life stories, manga, etc.\n\nFor me, this is one of the very few Yuri Visual Novels, and was a must-buy from what I heard. And I have no regrets- it is definitely worth the price-tag as well. Most will scoff at it, but this is very long for a Visual Novel- you have the main story scenes, the side-story scenes(marked by cherries on the planner), and then you also get access to post-main-story scenes which are represented by apples in the planner and are unlocked by making different choices in the main story.

No......not at all.\n\nGranted, #yuritopia is definitely an apt, one-word description for this VN, but....well....it's too substantial. Of course, Liar-soft knows their target audience quite well, so it is ultimately, uh, quite scandalous. So, it is obviously not nearly as philosophical as Utena or as strict as Hourou Musuko or as dramatic as Maria-sama. It's not that deep. But, it's not as fluffy as Yuruyuri or Love Live either. If I had to place it, I suppose it's spiritually not far off from Aoi Hana or maybe, Sasameki Koto? \n\nI think Yurirei is smarter than both of those though.\n\nTo begin with, Yuna is neither ditzy nor particularly shy. Her mature, reliable personality is the freshest possible gasp of autumn air as a female protagonist. Her quiet confidence is intoxicating, her mannerisms are delightful, and I identify with the way she thinks immensely. She does have some of the cold and withdrawn characteristics that I see more often in male protagonists, such as the famous Tomoya Okazaki, but she is about twice as caring, 10 times smarter, and 100 times as responsible as that guy. Hina is also amazing, even more so as seen through Yuna's eyes. Her blunt cuteness is not some ____dere gimmick, but the main pillar of her personality, and she is, in many ways, just as responsible and intelligent as Yuna herself. \n\nIn fact, in general, these writers seem to revel in introducing certain tropes, then annihilating them. In a low quality story, Aki would really just be an uptight prude that gets \"broken in\" by Youka. Then, their relationship would have no meaning beyond 'opposites attract.' Seina would just be a shy freshman. Tsukuyo would really be an incompetent teacher. Nena would just be a dumb girl that falls asleep all the time. In most stories of this type, I tend to think to myself, \"How are these people so thick and clueless?\" In Yurirei, I am just as likely to think, \"Oh, I didn't realize she'd already thought about it that much.\" or \"Whoa, that was quite perceptive.\"  \n\nAh, I fear I may have already spoiled too much. For maximum enjoyment, please go in blind now. \n\n*ahem*\n\nThe focus is on characterization, not panties; this is a story of romance, not sex: the uncertain confession, the embarassed atmosphere, the soft touch on the arm, tension, suspense, and ectasy. Their relationships develop in a way that feels natural, despite the manipulation by Yuna and our resident ghosts. Couples respect each others' boundaries, and they care deeply for each other. They plan their future together. They talk about how their parents or society might perceive them. Unnecessary fanservice is minimal, and even when kinky stuff finally starts happening, the art doesn't zoom in on their boobs, but does a great job of showing their expressions and body language; it is all rather sensual, and, imo, in very very good taste. \n\nHence, in case you haven't figured it out yet, if you're buying this just to, uh, yuri your yuri, you're probably going to be extremely disappointed. \n\nHowever, if you're a true yuri lover like me (hehe), you will fall in love with this......as I have.", "timestamp_created": 1456055494, "timestamp_updated": 1456058078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.718016", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21356117": {"recommendationid": "21356117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012037547", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456095292}, "language": "english", "review": "Being a happily married straight-ish female.

The game is fantastic. Probably one of the best takes in VN form on the yuri genre. It's light hearted, often funny and very touching towards the end, \"healing\", and characters are very cute. The things you may criticize in this game are mostly attributable to the development budget. That said, I can't comment on the translation. I assume it will be fine enough. The original text is plain and simple and I assume it remains as readable translated.\n\nLiar soft is one of the VN companies with a more indie feel. It makes very unique and fun games, though not necessarily with the highest production value. You can say it occupies a niche spot in an already niche market.\n\nOften times this is reflected in the fact that there is limited voice acting. That just means mostly the writer was more ambitious than the budget allowed in terms of full voice acting. I would also point out that although the consensus is fully voiced acted VNs are the way to go, partial voice acting allows writing of longer monologues, which some may enjoy. \n\nNow I was really surprised this game got released on Steam uncensored. The price is high but it's what you would expect for a limited audience release. If you buy this game it may encourage them to make bigger budget works with western release in schedule. When the volume is higher obviously that allows for different pricing schemes. \n\nFinally let me reiterate that the game is fantastic, espcially if you are a genre lover of yuri--it's not to be missed.

The stories intervine perfectly and the characters interact naturally with each other. One is able look into each character's head and maybe that's why they are all very likeable, everyone has their own reasonable concerns and worries. In terms of writing and length this may very well be the best visual novel I have read so far in a genre I am quite fond of but end up being disappointed very often.\n\nSadly the audiovisuals are not on par with the writing and those which other VNs present, I don't mind the mild and pure depiction of what made it unsuitable for all-ages, it's quite fitting actually and just shortly going back to the writing: Those scenes are actually quite meaningful unlike in some many other works.\n\nIt's obvious why the audio could be better, way better, while the Voice Actresses are all very good as one might expect, the times there is actually voice acting is very limited.\n\nAbout the visuals, while not bad at all, it'S just that in comparison the drawing appears crude and the number of sprites is low. I can't really argue about the prior but still I personally prefer it smoother.\n\nWoth mentioning and up to each self to decide is whether they really want a story with real choices and different endings because the choices here are swallow and there is only one ending for all. I really do not mind at all though obviusly it would had been an interesting read if it was possible to end up with other character.\n\nCertainly there is also the point regarding the price but that's again not up to me to decide, all I can is inform you about the fact that I took like 20... or maybe even 30? hours reading it (and like 20h idling, napping or doing something else while Steam was counting an alt-tab'd game) so it seems like a fair value proposition to me at least, as long as it is enjoyable that is and indeed this was the case for me.", "timestamp_created": 1455890558, "timestamp_updated": 1455890558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490041", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21317255": {"recommendationid": "21317255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064271640", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461504123}, "language": "german", "review": "wo ist dass denn ein sexgame \u00fcberhaupt nicht ich will mein geld f\u00fcr den scheiss von kindred spirits wieder zur\u00fcck.", "timestamp_created": 1455888671, "timestamp_updated": 1455888671, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.244231", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21313423": {"recommendationid": "21313423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136085375", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464406906}, "language": "english", "review": "A pros/cons rundown and some thoughts, for those thinking of buying the game! Sorry it's a little long,,\n\nPros:\n- Very very cute art! A good variety of sprites, expressions, and CGs.\n- Catchy and effective OST, with an included \u201cmusic room\u201d to listen to all the tracks.\n- Each character is distinct, has their own background, thoughts, motives, goals, personality, and problems/flaws that are all very relatable, or easy to sympathize with.\n- The couples\u2019 stories were all really compelling, and each and every one felt like it had something to offer.\n- Some common yuri tropes are addressed and consulted, exposed for their flaws, or given a very human, realistic spin to them.\n- While it was nothing mind-blowing, the story was always engaging in some way, and EXTREMELY emotionally investing. I cannot stress enough how invested this game gets you into its interesting and compelling cast of characters, and all their relationships with each other, romantic or otherwise. I cried and burst out laughing and smiled and was on the edge of my seat and relieved and every other emotional a game could make you feel. (well, except for afraid maybe, haha)\n- SO. MUCH. EXTRA. CONTENT. AFTER THE MAIN STORY. Hours worth of extra scenes are unlocked based on what choices you pick in the game, so make sure to save at every choice so you can easily unlock them all!\n- The sex scenes were all incredibly tender and sweet, with beautiful art in CGs, and none of them felt gross or overly fanservice-y. (though the lack of Super Explicit Content might be a negative for some people)\n\nCons/stuff to keep in mind:\n- Not all the scenes have voice acting. Only major story events, couple events, and scenes that have CGs include voice acting.\n- I\u2019m not a fan of a good handful of the voices. Too many of them are shrill and high-pitched, which can be pretty annoying, especially with the characters who are also loud and cheerful on top of that. (I recently found out this might because a LOT of the voice actors are reused for multiple characters)\n- Almost ALL the characters have obnoxiously high-pitched and squeaky voice acting during sex scenes.Doesn't ruin it, but it IS off-putting for me.\n- The background music doesn't loop; it fades out and then restarts, which can break immersion for some people.\n- No agency, and therefore no routes. The main character, Yuna, is entirely her own character, with her own goals and wishes and feelings. So, you can\u2019t change the outcome of situations or the story. YOU the player don\u2019t really have a say, and are only along for the ride. I know that tons of people will be disappointed to know that there are no routes and no agency on their part.\n- There\u2019s a couple that\u2019s a teacher and a student. Their relationship lacks the manipulation and toxic power-imbalance that plagues teacher-student sort of relationships, and so I personally was able to find enjoyment in their story, but I know that others might not, so I\u2019m putting this out there now. (note: it is possible to speed through their scenes and arc by selecting the \"Skip unread text\" option in the options menu and then using the skip button)\n- Unlocking all the extras can be kind of confusing. Not too hard, but a bit of a pain\n- Some of the sex scenes felt out of nowhere, or like they weren't properly lead up to\n- The sex scenes are also WAY TOO SHORT. Could've used some more detail in the text and, like\u2026 fumbling and exploring and learning.\n- Some of the dialogue in the sex scenes was so over-the-top or weirdly put that it was unintentionally funny\n- And finally, there's a glitch that me and a friend of mine have, though I haven't heard of anyone else dealing with this yet. About every 15-20 minutes, the game will dramatically slow down and stop progressing, and nothing but closing will fix it. I found a way to slowly save the game and then close from the menu, but it's a bit irritating to pull off. Didn't bother me too bad, but I know it'd be a huge pain for some people. Hopefully this glitch is extremely uncommon.\n\nAnd finally, some tips:\n\n- SAVE AT EVERY CHOICE. You will need to go back to them to unlock all the extras, and they are WORTH IT.\n- NEVER. FORCE CLOSE. THE. GAME. EVER. It'll insist that you haven't completed scenes that you have, and make you redo them just to move on in the story, every time you force close. Always close from the menu.\n- If you live with other people, wear headphones. Trust me.\n\nFinal thoughts? This game was an absolutely joy to play, especially for its great cast of characters and compelling stories. Absolutely worth the price and more, for me, and I hope others will enjoy the game as much as I did! \n\nIf you want a more indepth version of this overview though (plus some extra tips), I posted one here: http://systemrestart.tumblr.com/post/139577888536/with-less-than-a-day-until-the-initial-sale-for", "timestamp_created": 1455870502, "timestamp_updated": 1455870828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600374", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21313222": {"recommendationid": "21313222", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987226085", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507272935}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you having passing interest in anime lesbians?

The Voice Acting (VA) - For the most part the casting was spot on, the majority of characters fit well with their VA's however there were at least two cases were the VA's were horribly miss cast. They absolutely don't fit their respective characters. One especially more glaring than the other, and if you've watched as many anime and played as many VN as I have this can be  quite a major sore point.\n\n2. R+18 bits - Considering the premise it had to be done, otherwise the kindred spirits (or yuri-re as they want to be called) wouldn't be able to pass on. That said I believe that the game has massive potential to be a all ages love story that transcends gender boundaries. Simple and sweet. So I genuinely believe its R+18 portions actually hold it back.\n\nAnd with that over lets move on to the pros.\n\nStory - It's simple, it really is, there is no great drama, no dark mystery, no epic adventure, no grand revenge quest, nothing of that sort. But it works well for pieces like this. As an avid player of visual novels (VN) I've seen quite a myriad genres so, sometimes a nice fun and simple story like this is really just the best. 9/10\n\nArt - As with the story its fairly simple but well drawn, the art is crisp and nice, the character design was well thought out, each character having their own distincts faces and quirks. It's nothing impressive but theres nothing to complain about either. 8/10\n\nMusic/BGM - Same with the story it is failry simple, however they fit the mood of each respective story arc really well. Nothing on the level of Two Steps from Hell but then again this isn't that type of game. 8/10\n\nCharacters - Easily the best part of the game, I love the characters, ALL of THEM, they've all got their own personalities and quirks as well as distinct visual differences. Can't say much about them without bringing in spoilers but the attention to detail to each one is very pleasing espeically since they have a large cast of characters. And the character design is also well done, each individual is distinct from the other. This is actually impressive as even some highly praised VN's out there fall victim to their characters essentially being hair or skin color swapped versions of each other. 10/10\n\nGameplay - The format this VN uses is actually quite uniqe and refreshing and it also gets rid of the annoying repetitve nature of most other VN's when your chasing diffrent character arcs. It however means that replayability will sadly be non-existent save for reminesence. So it remains to be seen wether this is a good or bad idea. 8/10\n\nEnjoyment - I love Yuri VN's and its a damn shame more aren't in the english market. This was a nice change of pace however so it comes highly recomended. 10/10\n\nOverall - The Pros heavily , HEAVILY, outwiegh the cons so... 8.83/10\n\nTL;DR: I highly recommend this game to anyone who isn't averse to the genre (VN's or Yuri).

got released in Japan, which was back in 2012.\n\nWas the wait worth it?\n\nHell yes.\n\nAs another reviewer has mentioned, this story does have a very porny premise.  Two ghosts rope MC into playing yuri cupid for various couples in the school so that the ghosts can spy on them and learn how to make love to each other, as girls\u2014yes, this is morally questionable no matter how you word it\u2014but despite this, the story is not centered around sex at all.  Really.  It took me around 12 hours to reach the first nsfw scene, and all the way up those 12 hours, the story focuses on developing relationships, emotional connections, friendship.  Rather than sex being the focal point of the game, it feels very much like a beautiful culmination to everything that couple has experienced together up to that point\u2014from the confessions, to the trials and tribulations of trying get their love reciprocated, their sense of stability after ironing out misunderstandings.\n\nAlso, while the whole \u201cb-but we\u2019re both girls!\u201d may seem excessive at some points, homosexuality in Japan is still very much condemned.  But that\u2019s one of the most refreshing things about this game: not only does the story touch upon real issues like social stigma and family expectations, but it also doesn\u2019t write off the girl/girl romances as just a phase, like so many other works in yuri genre do.  One couple in particular discusses and plans their future together in the face of a homophobic society, and that really resonated with me.\n\nAs someone who has also tried out the Sono Hanabira series, which oversexualizes girls (and even glosses over the fact that one of them is a huge age gap student/teacher lol), I am very happy that this game doesn\u2019t treat homosexuality as a joke or something just to fetishize.  I really felt like the story was reaching out to girls in similar situations, living in fear of condemnation yet still brave enough to face their feelings and look forward to a brighter future.\n\nSetting aside my accolades for the story, the voice acting, art, and music are also superb.  The nsfw scenes are very tasteful, and despite the fact that the OST is about 12/13 tracks, the songs are catchy enough that I never felt bothered by it.\n\nConclusion: if you love girls, love girls loving girls, love a good story, please get this game.  It\u2019s $30, yes, but there\u2019s around 30 hours of gameplay, so it\u2019s well worth the money.  You won\u2019t regret it.", "timestamp_created": 1455633498, "timestamp_updated": 1455633498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 278, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.913532", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21252848": {"recommendationid": "21252848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022507862", "num_games_owned": 484, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464358314}, "language": "schinese", "review": "13\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u4e00\u76f4\u5446\u5728\u6211\u7684\u786c\u76d8\u91cc\uff0c\u767e\u5408\u5927\u6cd5\u597d", "timestamp_created": 1455631654, "timestamp_updated": 1455631654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21252002": {"recommendationid": "21252002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101648567", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455625907}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e24\u5e74\u524d\u63a8\u7684\uff0c\u8981\u8bf4\u4ec0\u4e48\u662f\u798f\u97f3\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u3002\n\u53e6\u5916steam\u4e0a\u7684\u65e0\u5220\u51cf\u7248\u7684\u3002\n[spoiler]\u5176\u5b9e\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5f88\u5c0f\uff0c\u8981\u770b\u7684\u8fd8\u4e0d\u5982\u53bb\u770b\u73b0\u5728\u7684\u5356\u8089\u756a[/spoiler]\n[spoiler]\u53e6\u5916\u6211\u6700\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u5e08\u751f\u7ec4\uff0cH\u65f6\u7684\u653b\u53d7\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u7b80\u76f4\u76f4\u6233\u4e2d\u6211\u5fc3\u810f\uff0c\u751c\u6b7b\u4eba[/spoiler]\n[b]\u603b\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u767e\u5408\u4e61\uff0cFor our Yuritopia\uff01[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1455628828, "timestamp_updated": 1455628828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709133", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21251692": {"recommendationid": "21251692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014273403", "num_games_owned": 450, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474001893}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely worth it if you're interested in VNs at all.

I saw this mentioned the week or so leading up to the game by a few people and I decided to give it a try since they had a demo avaliable. I'm extremely glad I did because this ended up being one of the best visual novels I've read, with wonderful characters and an emotinal plot. Though the game is rated 18+ and does contain sex scenes it's quite tame overall, and really doesn't even factor in until around halfway through the game. I was also surprised how the game tackles the subject of relationships, it doesn't pretend that they happen overnight or without some stumbling blocks. I mean the story is still pretty fluffly overall (it's about lesbian ghosts that wanna spread the lesbian around a school, c'mon) but I still think it took the romances realistically for the most part. Anyhow, let's break down what the pros, cons and nit-picks bout this game real quick.\n\nPros:\n-A great main character, Yuna was delightful throughout. Almost all of the characters (barring one or two minor examples) are well written\n-Emotionally engaging story, I'll admit I teared up quite a few times\n-Satisfying ending\n-Extra scenes that open up once you complete the main story\n-OST is good, even if there are only about 12 tracks.\n-Game takes relationships surprisingly seriously.\n\nCons:\n-Some of the couples are just not as interesting as others, and the game makes you follow every side story\n-Title is kinda weird. I read why it's that way but it's still weird.\n-There ain't much porn if that's what you're here for.\n\nNit-Picks:\n-I wish there had been just a bit more drama. I love the story but half the time the main character is just sitting around waiting for stuff to happen\n-While the extra scenes after the main story were a nice touch, they were kind of pointless overall, to be blunt. While it did flesh out the relationships between some characters a bit more, they didn't do much for me. I'd have much preferred it if they'd given each of the couples a \"one month later\" epilogue or something\n-Some of those songs in the OST, while good, might get annoying once they play for the 50th time\n-I wish the game was longer. Though this should probably be a pro, I think this is one of the best compliments you can give a game. I wish there was a sequel, anime, something,\n-By the way, if these ghosts wanted to see girls doing it, they DO have the internet. Feels like they could've solved this problem in 10 minutes. (I know not really, but still)\n\nOverall the game was a delight to play, and I hope more similar games come soon.

After playing, A Kiss for Petals - Remembering You, I really needed a new Yuri/Shoujo-Ai game to play and this filled that slot perfectly.\n\nThis is also the first uncensored visual novel on steam; however, the story does not center itself around this concept, but on the interesting interactions between the characters themseles. The scenes themselves are actually quite tastefull and fit with the game's character driven storyline.\n\nKindred Spirits on the roof is an innovative and refreshing take on the visual novel genre; therefore, I would recomend anyone buying this game to both be preprared for and understand what type of game it actually is.\n\nYou play as a slightly anti-social girl who, while eating alone on the roof, discovers two ghosts and is then draged into playing match-maker for a variety of different yuri couples.\n\nThe purpose of the game is to create a Yuritopia!\n\nWhat else do you need to know about it to XD\n\nAs of this moment, I have completely cleared Kindred Spirits on the Roof XD\n\nThe only real problem that I had with the game was the fact that steam overlay does not work and therefore I could not take recordings or screenshots; however, despite this the game was so good that I ended up losing a few days sleep.\n\nDespite having only one ending, the game has a massive amount of extra content after the initial storyline ends. Extra content is garnered by choosing different dialogue options when they are presented towards you; however, as previously mentioned, the game only has one ending so your choices do not actually affect the main game.\n\nOn the subject of characters, I was actually quite suprised by quite a few characters in this game as well as how my opinions on them shifted later on. There were about two or three characters I just did not connect with, but there were also quite a few a characters that I initialy disliked who ended up being some of my favorites. I actually wish that a few of these characters had gotten a bit more time spent on them, but there is always the possibility of a sequel....maybe.\n\nThe art style was about mid-range for me, but it was a lot better than I was expecting and actually complimented the game's other elements quite well.\n\nThe ending, which I will not spoil, brought everything to a close quite well.\n\nOverall this was quite a great game and I would deffinitly recommend it to those who enjoy yuri and/or visual novels.", "timestamp_created": 1455475202, "timestamp_updated": 1456715433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531337", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21207611": {"recommendationid": "21207611", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998512111", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469841064}, "language": "english", "review": "The best yuri visual novel you'll ever play.", "timestamp_created": 1455460368, "timestamp_updated": 1455460368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493882", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21207523": {"recommendationid": "21207523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283453803", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455874323}, "language": "english", "review": "Surprisingly well-written, despite its porny premise (two dead lesbians want to bang so that they may ascend to the afterlife).

In other words, I've already read it. Niche titles like this need all the support they can get after all, so if this VN even slightly interests you, I'd say go for it. (Guess I'm already showing my bias huh?)\n\n \u5c4b\u4e0a\u306e\u767e\u5408\u970a\u3055\u3093, officially translated to Kindred Spirits on the Roof, is a Visual Novel about love. Girls love, to be more precise. The protagonist of our story is Toomi Yuna, a student of Kokonotsuboshi Girls Academy of Commerce. The plot sets in motion when she encounters the ghost of two since long deceased girls who happened to fall in love with each other in the afterlife. These girls wish is to experience their \u201dfirst time\u201d together, only problem is, they're just not sure exactly how to do it. Which is why they request for our protagonist to create a \u201dYuritopia\u201d at the school, by helping girls struggling with their feelings. For those not so versed in weeb vocab: They're basically asking her to make the school into a lesbian paradise.\n\n And that's more or less it. I realize it sounds kinda dumb when I put it like that, but stick with me! What I described in the above paragraph might sound like some generic setup for some kind of porno or whatever, but be aware, this VN is far, far from what some people might want you to think. This is sadly the curse called prejudices this game is inherently burdened with. With the western VN market being such that it is, it's inevitable that it would at a glance be grouped with the likes of Nekopara or Sakura Beach etc. But I repeat, this is not the case. Kindred Spirits is not aimed at your usual western VN or Eroge demographic. If anything, Kindred Spirit panders more to the female readers than the male ones, as I feel it is completely devoid of the male gaze. Yes, there are sex-scenes. But then again, their focus and implementation relies more on the romantic aspects, rather the sexual ones. They are there not so you can get your rocks off, but to finalize and deepen the relationship you helped come to bloom. It's more beautiful than sexy, and cute rather than seductive. This is something that I feel needs to be brought to light, if just to ever so slightly elevate some of the prejudice plaguing this VN (or genre as a whole). It could certainly be seen as fanservicey or whatever the kids call it these days, but then again there is nothing inherently bad about that. Bottom line is that this VN is not offensive. It takes a concept that could easily make 100 times the profit by being a straight up Nukige, or self-insert Eroge, and instead makes something endearing and romantic out of it. That is at least commendable, if nothing else.\n\n But enough of that. Is the story itself any good? Is there any gameplay? The story itself is nothing complicated at all (which you could probably tell from the synopsis alone), but nor does it try to be. It is simply a story about love. It just so happens to be between girls this time. It is both cute, charming and funny as hell at times. It is a straightforward love story, without much depth, twists or deeper meaning. If you're feeling up for some HNNNG's then this is the story for you.\n\n The gameplay is not much to speak of to be honest, since the story is mostly linear. You won't have any bad endings or failed routes. Which also means that you won't alter the story overly much with your inputs, but rather reading a story. There's no fail state, game over, or dead ends, only love\uff5e. There are a couple of extra scenes and dialogue, but that's about it. The game time is somewhere between 10-30 hours. It is in other words, a relatively short to medium long-ish length VN depending on your reading speed. What I have seen of the translation so far is that it is not only up to par, but actually very good and genuine. It goes without saying that this is as good as it gets as an English reader.\n\nTL;DR: If you are looking for a romance heavy Visual Novel without having to self-insert as a faceless protagonist to sex up some underage girls, this is probably as good as it gets. If you don't mind, or even prefer GL over vanilla,  then this is no doubt as good as it gets no matter your other preferences. If you're looking for porn/fanservice, or something to get your rocks off, you should probably look elsewhere. The same goes for those wanting a dark, mature or deep story of any kind. What you're paying for is a cute, well-written and funny love story that I urge you not to miss.\n\n Anyways, those are my poorly written, hastily put together thoughts on this particular VN. Check it out I'd say. It's good. Ignore the usual prejudices, but at the same time, know what it is you're paying for when you buy it. I might come back to edit the review if it would prove necessary, but I'll get to that when I get to that.\n\n Thanks for reading, and remember:\u300c\u30e6\u30ea\u30c8\u30d4\u30a2\u300d\u306b\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1455368465, "timestamp_updated": 1455467087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.781832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21175150": {"recommendationid": "21175150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028979039", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455343402}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u62c9\u62c9  18X  \u6709\u4e2d\u6587\u8865\u4e01\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1455360393, "timestamp_updated": 1455360393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21173366": {"recommendationid": "21173366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032776414", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 10033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504225045}, "language": "english", "review": "I kinda suck at in depth reviews so i'll be blunt.\nThis is one of the most well-made, heartfelt and overall enjoyable VN's i've ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1455355187, "timestamp_updated": 1455355236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592107", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21172209": {"recommendationid": "21172209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150470772", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455610241}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u5c4b\u9876\u4e0a\u7684\u767e\u5408\u7075\n\u6700\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u767e\u5408\u6e38\u620f\n\u5bf9\u6211\u6765\u8bf4\u975e\u5e38\u7279\u522b\u7684\u5b58\u5728\n4\u5e74\u524d\u770b\u5230\u7acb\u7ed8\u7b2c\u4e00\u773c\u5c31\u559c\u6b22\u4e0a\u4e86\n\u611f\u8c22\u767b\u9646steam\n\n[spoiler]\u4f46\u662f\u4e3a\u4f55\u6ca1\u6210\u5c31 \u597d\u60f3\u628a\u59b9\u5b50\u4eec\u7684\u5934\u50cf\u653e\u5728\u9996\u9875\u2026\u2026(\u00b4\u2565w\u2565`)\t[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1455351248, "timestamp_updated": 1455352205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622179", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21170497": {"recommendationid": "21170497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172621475", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455346436}, "language": "schinese", "review": "13\u5e74\u6c49\u5316\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u60f3\u7740Liar\u8fd9\u6b21\u5012\u662f\u505a\u4e86\u4e2a\u6709\u610f\u601d\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u6ca1\u60f3\u5230\u5c45\u7136\u4e0a\u84b8\u6c7d\u4e86\uff08\u4ec6\uff09\u3002\n\u6c49\u5316\u8865\u4e01\u5728\u697c\u4e0a\u6709\uff0c\u8fd9\u91cc\u4e5f\u8865\u4e00\u4e2a\u94fe\u63a5\u597d\u60f9\n\u539f\u5e16\u5730\u5740\uff1a\nhttp://www.yamibo.com/thread-201679-1-1.html\n\u611f\u8c22\u7eee\u60f3\u541b\uff0cTochika\u59d0\uff0c\u571f\u8c6a\u59d0\uff0c\u6c50\u5bd2\u59d0\u59d0\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u7ec4\u91cc\u7684\u6210\u5458\u2014\u2014\n\u6ca1\u6709300\u8d26\u53f7\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u6211QQ\u53f7\u7684\u670b\u53cb\uff08\u5bf9\uff0c\u8bf4\u7684\u5c31\u662f\u4f60\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u79c1\u4fe1\u5bc6\u6211\u7ed9\u4f60\u8d26\u53f7\u5416\n\n\u6c99\u7eb1\u5f88\u7f8e\uff01\u6c99\u7eb1\u5f88\u7f8e\uff01\u6c99\u7eb1\u5f88\u7f8e\uff01 \u56e0\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u5b9a\u8981\u8bf4\u4e09\u904d\u2014\u2014\n\u5927\u5bb6\u4e00\u5b9a\u8981\u559c\u6b22\u4e09\u4eba\u7ec4\u5662\u221a\n\n\u201c\u7686\u69d8\u3001\u3088\u3046\u3053\u305d\u30e6\u30ea\u30c8\u30d4\u30a2\u3078\u201d\n\u201cWelcome to the Yuritopia\u201d\n\u201c\u6b22\u8fce\u6765\u5230\u767e\u5408\u4e61\u201d", "timestamp_created": 1455344300, "timestamp_updated": 1455344300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.763286", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21169024": {"recommendationid": "21169024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043629545", "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1875, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472747532}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros: Shipping\nYuri\nCute Soundtrack\nYuri\nArt is cute\nYuri\nTranslation is on point.\n\nCons: It's 35 dollars.\n\nVerdict: Buy it.

Spoiler-tags are used liberally, and I'm not going to bring any big spoilers into the review whatsoever--I want you to experience the game on your own!\n\n[h1]The demo is free from MangaGamer, and is roughly 2 hours in length.[/h1]\nReally, just try it.\n\n[h1]This isn't a nukige.[/h1]\nNukige being defined as a game where the plot only exists as a vehicle for sex. If you're looking for graphic content, this is probably not the game for you.\nSpoiler includes the length of time before reaching the first 'erotic' scene:[spoiler]15 hours[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]The game has partial Voice-Acting[/h1]\nHow partial? Well... about a fifth. From my estimation (not looking at raw files, but simply from my experience playing the game...) it seems to be somewhere around five to six hours of voice acting. That's more than any single season of anime will have, anyway. All of the funniest, most exciting, or most painful moments are acted--it is a slight disappointment that it all isn't, but, they made sure they got the most out of the performances, and they are well-done.\n\n[h1]This game has a full SoundTrack.[/h1]\nThey're somewhat modest about mentioning it, but there are over a dozen tracks, not including the opening and ending. Their usage and application in each and every scene are great and help reinforce the writing and bring it to it's fullest emotional potential. Some of the tracks you WILL connect to emotionally by the end.\n\n[h1]The game has roughly 25 hours of content.[/h1]\nThere's more details about this throughout my review, but, putting it here as well. After getting the 100% completion, I had spent 26 hours myself.\n\n[h1]This is mostly a kinetic novel.[/h1]\nThere are some choices to be made, and some alternate scenes and dialogues to be had, but you're mostly along for the ride. There is some non-linear experience, and plenty of perspective changes, but the story is pretty much set. There might be an alternate ending--I don't know yet though, and its definitely something you should experience for yourself! Gameplay is mostly just taking the story at your own pace, and choosing what parts you want to see first.\n\n\n\n\nI played the demo before playing this game--it's available from the developer's website and is roughly 2 hours in length (at least, for my reading/emotional engagement speed)\n\nI played the game immediately upon release from the developer's website, some many hours before the official Steam release. I slept around 4 hours after making it through a decent bit, and then finished it. I imported my save into the Steam version by simply copy+pasting the save directory.\n\nI spent 19 hours playing through the main scenario after speeding through the identical demo scenes, leaving me with a 21 hour playtime. After completing the main scenario, extra scenes were interspersed throughout--a large amount, actually. I would estimate at roughly a quarter of the main scenario in length--you're getting closer to [u][b]30 hours than 20 with this game[/b][/u], at my speed. \n\nEDIT2: I finished all of the extra scenarios. They are VERY numerous (78 in all!) and well written and fill in every gap. It took me an additional 5 hours to read them all, so that raises my time spent to 26 hours before full clearing the game. And even if the main scenario is over, the extra scenes are VERY much worth your time.\n\n\n!!NOTE!! This review is a work in progress. This concludes my fact-based guide. I will be updating this review with my full thoughts on the game shortly.

You'll find little bits of \"Westernization\" here and there, but nothing that'll really disrupt the dialogue.

There really isn't much to say about the game since it's pretty straightforward and full of fluff for you to discover. The premise is very simple though - Toomi Yuna assists two \"kindred spirits\" (yurirei, a play on words that literally translates to lily spirits or otherwise known as lesbian spirits) on the roof in hooking lesbians up at her school. Everything is very lighthearted and soft though. But don't forget this game is 18+ for a reason...\n\nIn any case, if you are looking to buy this game, be aware that some parts are not voiced in this game, so that MAY take away from your experience. Typically, introduction scenes (for new characters and the whatnot) and important ones (romantic CGs, certain scenes, etc) are voiced, but the common chitchat scenes are not voiced. \n\nI would recommend this game for anyone who likes visual novels in general and is appreciative of the yuri genre. \n\nYuritopia Simulator 2016 is a go!\n\nEDIT: WOW, after playing through the entire game, I feel absolutely compelled to play it all again. Everything about this game is simple - the art, the story, the music - but yet, I was just so moved and enjoyed every minute of it. In this case, Okujou no Yurirei-san really proves that simplicity is not a bad thing at all. In fact, it is what makes this game so good in my opinion.\n\nI won't go into any spoilers, but all I can say is I really loved the moral of the story and how so many things are connected with one another.

I wasn't expecting much when I bought it, but what I got out of it was a good 30 hours of surprisingly complex character development, adorableness, and quite a few \"squee soo cute\" moments. It's a bit pricy, but considering how much I got out of it, I'd say it's totally worth it. \n\nThere were a few s\u2764x  scenes, but nothing that didn't feel deserved and natural in the flow of the character's relationships. They definitely weren't the focus of the game, more of just a culmination of hours of watching the character's develop their relationships. If you're looking for something s\u2764xy, then you'll be disappointed, but if you come into this looking for an adorable and surprisingly complex (despite the tropes) VN about various girls falling in love you'll be pleasantly surprised.\n\nAs you'd expect, I do have a few complaints. The first would be that only some scenes are voice acted. The voice acting that is there is excellent, but it does make the remainder of the VN feel a bit bare in comparison. In addition, the soundtrack could have used more variety. There's only a few songs you'll be hearing repeatedly throughout the whole experience, usually one per \"mood\". What is there is good, (escpecially A A Ai, Youka's song), but it can get tiring after a while.\n\nOne final thing to note: the Steam overlay causes issues with the game. If you want to experience it properly you'll want to launch it directly from the game folder. I noticed that text tended to lag and certain videos (like the end game credits) failed to load properly if launched from Steam. This will throw off your hour count unfortunately, but it's really all you can do.\n\nOverall I'd give this a 8/10.

I'm so addicted! This game has pretty bad UX. There's quite a few things I hate, but I just can't stop playing it. It's fun.\n\nDefault keyboard shortcuts are awful. Ctrl z, then # to cast a spell. 0 to explore, p to pickup, directional keys to move. I don't have 3 hands, I can't be in all those places at once! \n\nIt's annoying how bad the in game help is. I don't want to have to alt tab to lookup everything, just tell me what it is ingame!\n\nTwo annoying ways I died to far: \n1) In a village, my wizard Chat'd some sort of giant. He got mad and double punched me and I died from full health.\n2) Hunger. Seriously, I can die in like 5 hours of game time from hunger.\n\nI think I read some advice saying fighter better for newbies and wizard is harder. NO. Wizard is SO much easier. Fighter can't run away very well, Fighter has to worry \"if I melee attack this monster, will I be cursed/doomed/my weapon corrodes\", will this monster hit me once and cause some effect that lets him hit me 10 more times until I die?\n\nTreasure Hunter is awesome, but it's annoying you have to know that you have to pick \"Alert\" as your starting talent to get it. How was I supposed to figure that out without reading online?\n\nRight now I'm trying to start a Lawful charismatic barbarian orc who can read.

I mainly bought the Steam version to support the brilliant Developer!  I never sent him his postcard and for that I feel guilty - so I bought it instead, he certainly deserves the money.\n\nSo - \n\nRoguelikes like ADOM aren't necessarily about being 'fair' but instead are about risk management, survival, and learning.  Do I recommend ADOM?  Hell yes!\n\nSome very minor spoilers exist below, plus a rambling anecedote about a real life survival training exercise - so, fair warning...\n\nI remember one of the first times I played ADOM I kicked a staircase in a dungeon and the whole dang thing fell down on my head, killing my pretty successful character who had gone further than other runs up to that time!  I was like, what the hell was that?!?  I looked it up and it is a known thing that happens rarely.  Apparently if you kick stairs you can get a bonus (I think it builds strength?  It has been awhile), but occasionally it will kill you dead.  It is rare that kicking stairs will kill you - but it happened to me on the first try so I guess I won the anti-lottery.  \n\nI quit ADOM for a few weeks in disgust, then went back and avoided kicking stairs :).  Eventually (after 3 years of on and off effort) I beat the game (Elven Archer) for the normal win (closing the chaos gate) and had low enough chaos I got a  good ending too.   This was all on an older ASCII version, not the Steam version.  I actually took my wife out to dinner and had a nice bottle of champagne to celebrate - few games actually make you feel like you achieved something for real, but I felt like I had done so when I beat ADOM!\n\nSo personally I rate ADOM as one of the greatest games I have ever played.  Don't let occasional unfairness deter you from playing it.  Swear a lot when you die, have a break, and try again when you are ready.\n\nFun fact - I later did a survival training walk in the Pilbara in Australia's outback - it was a five day hike starting out intot the wild with only two litres of water and a full belly (plus a basic survival kit and one of those lightweight survival blankets).  I wasn't alone (5 other students plus two instructors) but it was as close to a real emergency as could be 'safely' simulated - we had to find and purify our own water, improvise any tool besides our survival knives, forage for what food we could (or starve, we did a fair bit of that :), make our own shelter and fire, navigate for ourselves etc (we did have a somewhat out of date and high level map of the general area), and on the last day our instructors kindly abandoned us (they did give us a walkie-talkie in case something really went wrong :) and we had to reach the finish line without even their comforting advice (thats what they were there for really, to advise us, and teach us a last few things that you have to be in the field to learn, and also to maybe save our butts if we got bitten by a snake, but not to do the work for us - it was survival training!).  \n\nAnyway, the point of this rambling story - at times on that walk, I found myself feeling like I was playing ADOM :).  It was all about resource management, cautious risk taking, maintaining what control you could - more over yourself than anything else really - and thus staying calm and clear thinking, preserving your health and wellbeing, and not giving up, no matter what.  It was tough, but man was it (masochistically) fun (and who woulda thunk you can find a pebbly pile of rocks as soft as a featherbed after 4 days of survival hiking.  Wow!)\n\nBut there you go - Roguelikes like ADOM can actually teach you some aspects of survival thinking. Now that's potentially handy!  \n\nSo if you have no other survival skills, but find yourself in a survival situation, try to think like you are playing a hardcore roguelike is my advice (but you know, if you die, you don't get to try again, so be extra roguelike!).  \n\nSo go play ADOM!", "timestamp_created": 1515219946, "timestamp_updated": 1515220239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519685", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38977556": {"recommendationid": "38977556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096405225", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3984, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487205638}, "language": "english", "review": "The best roguelike of old going strong into the future!

Even if the refreshing feel is some unfortunate luck it will still be a enjoyable challlenge. Sure you can reroll a character or such to get a better start, but many other games allow that too. So if you like to power game and min/max things go right ahead. Knowlegde is a better weapon in this game then most things and you will get that in time.

No game has ever had me fist pump, yell with glee, scream in terror, or pout with discouragement as this game. That's what makes it great, it's a game that inspires very strong emotions, and that's why I love it. Upsides are there are tons of artifacts I've only seen once then never again, or not at all, making exploration very exciting, you never know if you'll find some new epic gear you've never seen before each playthrough. Now the downside, this is a roguelike, you expect it to be hard. You want it to be hard. You want to lose a character you loved, come back and kill that SOB with your next guy with flaming fires of avenging RAGE! That you can do, and it feels great, but early game is really, really tough. Specifically there are creatures which with one hit can poison you, stun you, confuse, or paralyse you, any of these status affects almost always end up in instant deaths. And first times through you won't know, hey don't get close to that guy or you'll die, in 1 hit. You're just hitting everything else like normal then pop, game over.

So, imagine my surprise when it got a successful launch of Indiegogo; I'd have joined onto that investment opportunity, but well, ADOM had faded from my mind by that point and wasn't actually looking for it. However, these days, I'm happy I didn't get on it, as I throughly regret purchasing ADOM Deluxe. \n\nWhen I first bought ADOM Deluxe, it had like 50% of the promised features on day one. Then, the developer went on a very long hiatus, holding up the development team, and we had no content updates for over a year and a half. I gave up on the game, sometime around June of 2017, of ever seeing an actual update to ADOM. Fast forward 6 months, and I found out that ADOM finally got a slew of major updates. So, I redownloaded the game to try it out.\n\nHonestly, I should have just left ADOM on steam collecting dust. The interface changes are terrible; hell in the character creation screen, most of the text pops out of the interface boxes... a sign that things weren't going to be good. Created a new character, and most of the controls I've learned to use from the old ASCII build and the build I played back in Dec of 2016, are all changed. The interface and controls has been changed and not for the better. Being that the game forces you to know a ton of information, just to make it playable, forcing players to relearn a brand new interface and keybindings is too much.\n\nHonestly, I'd suggest everyone to stick to the free, ASCII build. It was a pretty good game then, and it is now too, but you have to really dig to find it, and these days I have better things to do that relearn everything from scratch. If you want to support Thomas, then buy the game. But, if you want to play the game, don't bother with the Deluxe edition.\n\nI'd stick around and offer advice on how to fix things, but honestly, the last time I tried to do that, the toxic community and the hostile development team, ate me alive.

I though that ADOM would be another success in that line of games that I would really embrace, and was really looking forward to playing it.  \n\nAnd there are a lot of things that ADOM does well, such as a better graphics presentation than anything else not-named TOME or some character building options and decisions.  You also have the major keys you want to press that bring up various screens on the side of the UI so you can use hotkeys like every Roguelike player has had to do or you can just click and play that way.  Good job on those, ADOM!\n\nI also enjoy the additions of leveling up with skills, training, the sign you were born under, and more, and the character design has more teeth to it than a lot of other games in the genre.  \n\nThere are a few qualms that I have though.  Most Roguelikes are hard, that's the point.  They are designed to be a challenge, and no less so with ADOM, especially in the early game. I give ADOM mad props for being tough too.  But where it errs is pushing that to design decisons that make the game require extensive foreknowledge or heavy subsequent plays to have a shot at winning.  I'll give you two examples of that in a moment.  But that is not a normal Roguelike tactic. I can pick up, and win at, Angband without reading the entire wikia first and five or six walkthroughs and watching YouTube videos.  Sure, I will get better as I play more, which is true of other games, but Angband and friends always played fair with you, even when it was playing hard.  I won Angband without scumming.  I never came close to beating Moria.  I almost beat Zangband, but lost in the final battle.  You get the idea.    \n\n\nADOM doesn't play fair.  It has design decisions that force you to know about ahead of time and plan for. \n\nHere are two examples, one early, and one later:\n\nEarly Example - In the first town, there are two mutually exclusive quests that you could come across by talking with one of two people there, and the first one you talk to gives that quest.  Since you have a quest coming into that town to talk to as many people in the first town as you can, you are talking to them anyways, as there is an in-game incentive to complete that quest.  But one of two quests gives you a prize thats good for some characters and not others, and vice versa.  I took the wrong quest becuase I didn't know that the town had two quests that are mutually exclusive, and they don't even need to be.  Both create seperate dungeons and characters, and you certainly could do them both.  Without knowing the rewards ahead of time, you miss out on a major quest reward early.  \n\n\nMiddle Game Example - There is a dungeon in the game called the pyramid that you cannot get to until you're of a high enough level.  I entered it when I arrived in the vicinity with my Halfling Duelist and was told I didn't have an invite.  Then around level 14 I found a papyrus and read it, and I was invited for a challenge at the pyramid. Now's that's totally fine up until now.  You have dungeons that open up later pretty often in lots of RPGs, including Roguelikes such as Zangband.  I finished my dungeon delve of this 12 level dungon and then by the time I had finished I had reached level 17, and then I stepped out, dropped off some of my extra gear at this oasis I found, and then went to the pyramid.  But I couldn't enter it.  Why not?  I still had the papyrus with me.  So I looked it up on the Wikia.  And this is a major and very important dungeon to complete because the ruler has two major guaranteed artifacts you really want to snag.  And the issue was that you can only enter it from levels 13-16.  I was too high to do that challenge.  I saw that one of the items, a special armor, is one that is perfect for my class, and really helps you survive long term, and I missed out.  \n\nThat's ADOM.  Design decisions have been made about the game but have not been communicated to you as a player.  The papyrus that invited me to the pyramid didn't say that I couldn't arrive after level 16 and it was a limited time offer.  The quest in the first city never said that if I accepted it I couldn't do another quest instead.  \n\nSo the result is a game that appears, with the investment of a few hours, to be a sturdy entry into the Roguelike genre, but the more I delve into it, the more I realize that this is not a game that plays fair with me as a player.  And why would I want to continue to play that sort of game after already investing more than 20 hours into it? \n\nThis could have been a game I would easily have seen myself with 100+ hours.  But there are these horrible design choices that don't respect me as a player or give me the agency to change them in the game.  That's a major philosophical issue that I hope the game cleans up.  And if it does, and becomes more player friendly with inforamtion in the game, or changing up some of those design decisions, then I would certianly be open to revisiting this review and the game itself.  But that's not today.  And it's likely not tomorrow either.  \n\n\nIt's okay to be hard.  It's not okay to hide information that makes the game harder.", "timestamp_created": 1513563655, "timestamp_updated": 1513564135, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 84, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695315", "comment_count": "13", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1514021402, "developer_response": "Thanks for the extensive comments.\n\nI agree with you (somewhat) on the pyramid issue - there could be a hint about this being a timed quest that only is available for a limited amount of time. Please note two things though: (a) It is highly unlikely that you will win the game on a streak that first gets you to the pyramid - so normally you'll not lose anything as you will have learned about the time limit after one game. (b) While the rewards are very good they are still not required in any way to win. So it's not like you are truly losing something important.\n\nNonetheless I get your point and have added an RFE to address this issue in one of the next releases: http://www.adom.de/forums/project.php?issueid=5863\n\nI personally disagree about your comments on the mututally exclusive quests in the village... as neither of it is truly important for solving the game and there are so many different venues you can take in the beginning that it IMHO just doesn't matter. BTW the (a) argument from above also applies here: Probabilities are basically zero that you are going to win on your first, second or third game - so by the time you have learned enough you'll know about the exclusivity.\n\nThe design philosophy behind this is basically that choices matter - being able to do everything at any time is quite easy for the player, but I prefer forcing you to make difficult choices. That's also why I agree about the pyramid point because you (1) don't even get to know abut being forced to make a choice and (2) the rewards are a lot more important than the ones in the village choice.\n\nIn summary: Thanks for your feedback and sorry for you not being able to enjoy ADOM as much as you should due to my conscious choices. \n\nMerry Christmas nonetheless!"}, "38389773": {"recommendationid": "38389773", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970547237", "num_games_owned": 509, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 12534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511594430}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing ADOM for 15 years, and I still love it.

The idea of a title with complex, emergent gameplay with an evident and long history of development gave me strong Dwarf Fortress vibes.\n    ADOM is probably one of the more Rogue-like roguelikes you can find on Steam. The game is stuffed with content, including dozens and dozens of ways to meet your demise. If you survive, the game promises many rewards. You can become a king, or achieve godhood. Neither of which I experienced, because in my few hours of the game I simply stumbled into various ways to die within 24 hours.\n    I had mild frustrations with the controls and UI. Usually the mouse would be sufficient to navigate and find the information I wanted, but sometimes I would find myself confused on why a spell didn't fire correctly or how to perform certain actions. Understandable considering it's history, but that doesn't mean I'm still not a spoiled modern gamer. Evidently the game will be getting an updated rerelease sometime soon, which I expect will resolve some user unfriendliness.\n    I'd highly recommend this game if you're deep into roguelikes, difficult games, or imaginative adventures. I'd also recommend this title if you missed out on 90s PC gaming and want a little taste of history.\n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxlvjS8FkD0&ab_channel=UnlimitedAmmo] Impressions [/url]", "timestamp_created": 1511839816, "timestamp_updated": 1511839816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455397", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37803730": {"recommendationid": "37803730", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993437410", "num_games_owned": 665, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "last_played": 1515502437}, "language": "english", "review": "ADOM belongs with Angband and Nethack as one of the definite classic roguelikes.

Then if you digg it pick up the Steam version to encourage further developement.", "timestamp_created": 1511460806, "timestamp_updated": 1511460806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

I didn't even know that you could do that. Which leaves my snarky remark as the only remaining comment from me and shifts the picture more negatively than it IMHO originally appeared.\n\nTo repeat the factual points I raised in my now deleted comment:\n- It seems that the review does not relate to the most recent release but an older version as many aspects (like tedious keymapping, missing hints and guidance) have been addressed. As we try very hard to improve the game based on feedback I advised the reviewer to once more try out the latest release and see if it felt improved for him.\n- I commented on being expensive with the statement that this IMHO is a highly subjective matter. I strongly believe in adding value instead of in engaging in endless discount battles and that's a point to which I stand firmly. I can't feel that the price of a single movie ticket is too expensive for any decent game at all and I believe that ADOM is more than decent enough to be rated at that price level.\n- I do not think that ADOM easily screws your character. Examples would be welcome, flat bland statements do not make for a good or helpful review.\n- Regarding repetitveness I pointed the review to the various modes in all the latest releases that allow you to create a new character (even with extensive customization) with 3-6 clicks (and a name you need to enter). Which hardly can be called repetitive any more. It takes about 5 seconds to generate a new character if you know what you want to play. Naturally if you check all choices and optimize attributes to the last bit this can take much longer. But that is not necessary to enjoy or win the game and thus a conscious player choice.\n- And about me being unprofessional: I'm sorry for reacting with an attitude after you snarked at my initial comments which tried nothing but to explain. I believe I'm taking a lot of time and effort to listen to the player community in general and respond appropriately. What I'm done with after 25 years of doing this is taking people seriously who are rude, dumb, trollish or simply unfactual. Yes, then I'm also leaning towards reacting likewise because I am a human being that spent most of those 25 years doing this for fun in my free time without earning money for it. And I come from a generation where burning down trolls was a good sport. But that doesn't mean you generally will find me unprofessional. I welcome you to discuss this with me face to face at Roguelike Celebration next week in San Francisco if you happen to be around that area (see https://roguelile.club).

ADOM is exemplary in game design, has a multitude of options and is, for the most part, fair.

Switching between both styles is simple (F10), too, so that is a plus.\n\ntl;dr: buy this if you want to play a piece of roguelike history\n\n\n\np.s.: thank you Gordon Overkill for having so many great gameplay videos, as that helped me make the purchase :)", "timestamp_created": 1492984147, "timestamp_updated": 1492984147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31264739": {"recommendationid": "31264739", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992221936", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 826, "last_played": 1516231383}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0442.", "timestamp_created": 1492728329, "timestamp_updated": 1492728329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482196", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30866665": {"recommendationid": "30866665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090002778", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 15948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502600775}, "language": "english", "review": "ADOM causes me to not sleep enough.

It's colossal.\n\nFirst of all before you start the game you have to understand that the game has kind of a learning curve, there will be a lot of deaths caused by things you did not expect. If you especially hate starting over, the game is not for you. I hate starting over too but not enough to deter me from this masterpiece. There are so many race/class combinations to give you a new kind of game that you are mostly just excited to try again with different tools - if your high elf wizard died early to some trivial door trap, start over with a troll beastfighter. Now you maybe cannot read but hey, the trap that killed the flimsy elf only tickles you. Maybe use those spellbooks you find as missiles now? And if you die again perhaps try a more stealthy approach as a gnomish assassin. You get the idea. \n\nThe monster library is endless and the game story is intriguing, I dunno how anyone can have the intelligence and creativity required to make this game happen but I am glad someone did. It's a very complex and unforgiving RPG - to be able to beat the game honestly you will need a lot of time, brains, patience, nerves and also some luck. ADOM is _not for everyone_ but I still recommend if you like RPG's and a BIG challenge. TIP> use the internet for information, there is a good wiki.

I am just letting people know to disregard any negative reviews concerning keyboard commands and key bindings.  I just played a bit and used my mouse for the entire session.  There are many key commands if you just want to use a keyboard, but ALL of the keyboard commands are listed right next to the written commands.  You do not have to memorize tons of keyboard commands to play ADOM. There's even floating text windows that appear when you mouse over certain things.\n\nADOM is now streamlined and very user friendly!  I almost didn't purchase this game because of the negative reviews concerning the multitude of keyboard commands. So if you were on the fence about purchasing this game but was worried about having to memorize many keyboard command, it's not true any longer.  You can use your mouse for \"most\" of the commands.  I never needed to use the keyboard once...\n\nJust by my brief session with the game, I can assure you that this is a quality game made with a lot of love!  There are many options covering all aspects of the game.  The UI is basic, but again has many options and is also mouse driven.

ADOM is (originally) an extremely hard, ascii based rouge-like which has been around on multiple formats since the late 90's. Personally I think it's by far the best traditional rogue-like, and I've tried a few over the years.\n\nEven with what would easily be over five hundred hours playing this game over the last 15+ years or so, first on Amiga, then on Windows. I've only ever completed this game once, and even then I was cheating by backing up my save file. Something which is uneccesary in this Steam version, as there is the option to disable perma-death in exchange for a big reduction in points. There are also options to selct optimal birth month, stat rolls, etc. Which saves a LOT of time if you play ADOM as I do with a specific charachter class in mind.\n\nThe graphics and sounds actually add quite a bit to the gameplay.  Especially the sound which allows you to hear if you've hit or missed or been hit. And graphics for example; It's much easier to locate the tiny girl in Terinyo when you can see a graphic of a tiny girl instead of a red \"t\" which under the Windows version could look almost identical to an orange \"t\" on some monitors.\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with ADOM, even if familiar with other rogue-likes such as Angband, the keyboard configuration will seem a bit alien. But the list of keybindings is readily available in-game by pressing \"?\" as well as on the title screen, so it shouldn't take too long to get comfortable. For those familiar with ADOM, you'll be pleased to know that it's exactly the same.\n\nOh, and I don't know if I'm just being distracted by the beautiful hand-pixelled graphics and atmospheric music, but it seems to be just a little bit harder that the text-based ADOM, especially the small mountain cave. Getting a character over level ten can be an achivement.\n\nIs it worth paying fifteen bucks to play a game you can get for free without the graphics/sound? Hell yeah! The only thing I can think of which is wrong with it is the text can be a bit small, but then the display has more lines, so it evens out I guess.\n9.2/10", "timestamp_created": 1482399354, "timestamp_updated": 1485491986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661549", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28324011": {"recommendationid": "28324011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120841934", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 30709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1083, "last_played": 1516197049}, "language": "english", "review": "ADOM is not for the faint of heart: you will die.

ADOM is a pretty venerable one, not quite as old or well-known as games like nethack but it's an important one. Why? Well, one thing people attribute to roguelikes pretty often is that they are hard and obtuse. To a certain degree this is true, but not always. Playing a valkerie and knowing how to write Elbereth makes nethack pretty easy, or you can play something like Dredmor or a Mystery Dungeon game to have an easier time. \n\nBut ADOM takes being weird and hard to higher levels. Cats are a constant menace. Funny lizards make you think that wasn't a good idea. Why does this level have so many corpses in it and why does my mouth have tentacles in it? ADOM probably won't give you the answers to these questions without making you work for it. \n\nAnd yet we find ADOM here on Steam, with shiny new features that make playing an old fashioned roguelike a little more palatable for people who weren't doing it in the 90s. The updated tileset is excellent, letting characters have personality and making the screen much more clear than the old ASCII symbols while retaining the ability to switch back when you want to see the whole level at once. Perhaps the biggest change is the ability to save and reload (at the cost of reducing your final score, of course). This makes the many, many fatal mistakes that one can encounter in the Draklor Chain a little less punishing. It might not help you from starving right off, but it could keep you from losing right at the start in the Puppy Cave. Then there are the weekly challenges, to add spice to players who are constantly looking for new ways to play. \n\nAll things considered, ADOM is a classic roguelike and the Steam release has a lot to recommend it. If you are a fan of newer roguelikes like Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup or Dungeons of Dredmor and want to dip into older titles, this is the place to be.

It was top of the line in its day and drove very well at the time. For a number of years, it's been sitting in a garage, and the owner recently decided to bring out the car, spruce it up, and get it back on the road. The paint has been touched up, the upholstery has been redone. The car was made before a lot of features you'd expect today were put in, so the owner has got seatbelts put in, and a new sound system, and some other odds and ends. But a lot of the car is still the same... it runs on a diesel engine, standard transmission, no power steering. It's a beautiful car, but it is still, in many respects, a product of its time.\n\nADOM is much the same. It's a fantastic game. It has more depth and complexity than just about any game out there, and is fiendishly challenging without being unfair (mostly). I've put in more hours into ADOM than probably any other game I've played, donated happily to the Indiegogo campaign, and look forward to the new developments as they come out. But if you've never played Rogue-likes from the 90s, you'll probably be in for a shock, much like if you've never driven without power steering, you'll be in for a shock the first time you try to drive without it. The interface is admittedly clunky, and despite the dev team's best efforts to modernize it, the learning curve is still pretty steep, and figuring out how to perform a given action (let alone when you ought to perform that action) isn't always transparent. I can imagine a lot of players finding this off-putting, and I think if you look at the negative reviews of this game, this is very much the kind of sentiment you'll see. This game isn't for everybody; due both to its difficulty and to its aesthetic, it will probably only appeal to a certain segment of players. Like the classic car.\n\nIf you've played ADOM before, you'll probably love it as much as you did then.

I played it quite a while, first the free version and then the Steam version, and I am still charmed by its music, by its atmosphere, by its depth. Even the minimalist tileset is charming.\nNow I have all this hunger to master the game. It's slowly becoming an addiction, trying to go deeper or further than the last time. I'm learning bits and pieces and having a grand time. It's like learning to juggle, every time adding one more ball to an already incredible act. Even death is sometimes fun. Last night I laughed as I died, heavily poisoned, right after emerging victorious close to HMV. The Gods were tired of my nagging to them and chose not to answer me. But who cares, one more ball was added to the juggle. \nAnyway, to all of you trying to decide the game's worth based on Steam reviews: get it, pour a glass of wine and join me in my quest to master this wonderful game.", "timestamp_created": 1460665738, "timestamp_updated": 1460665738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475811", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22270779": {"recommendationid": "22270779", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993846127", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 48672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505751293}, "language": "english", "review": "In my humble opinion: One of the best *games I have ever played.\n\n\n\n*Roguelike\n**If that is your cup of tea\n*** Cup is ok starsign for a monk", "timestamp_created": 1459957523, "timestamp_updated": 1459957523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22237589": {"recommendationid": "22237589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044006471", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 11407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471977716}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1459782826, "timestamp_updated": 1459782826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.396510", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22232113": {"recommendationid": "22232113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032946058", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484788337}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played adom since i was far too young to understand much of anything- and ive kept coming back for over a decade- and  i have no intention to stop now", "timestamp_created": 1459752226, "timestamp_updated": 1459752226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501812", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22144832": {"recommendationid": "22144832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040831641", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1912, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510459029}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best games that I have ever played.

This review is coming from someone who has not played the original games in the series and has no prior knowledge, and from someone who didn\u2019t grow up playing this type of game either. Please bear that in mind with this review. \n\nGameplay is like any other roguelike game, where you get to choose from an array of different characters, and develop levels, statistics and skills as you progress.  The game is played from a top down angel and is very heavily weighted towards stats and what choices you make in whether you succeed or fail.  The game\u2019s tutorial absolutely bombards you with way too much information which personally left more confused compared to when I first started. The controls and UI are quite possibly the worst I have ever experienced in a game too. There is quite literally a different button for every single mechanic in the game. This game made me feel sufficiently stupid because of how much jumble there is on any one screen at any time. The game was telling me to use buttons that I don\u2019t think I have ever used on this keyboard. I am surprised this is one of the most popular roguelikes ever just from going off the usability of the game thus far. \n\nThe graphics are bad, there is no way around it and anyone who says otherwise is purely saying it from a nostalgia standpoint.  The pictures in the screen shots are definitely not what the game looks like on my screen, and I was playing the game in 4k. \n\nI am still stuck in the tutorial of the game, because of being dumbfounded with the controls and the amount of information being thrown at me but this game if you manage to get into it, will offer you hours and hours of content with a very high replay ability factor also being the main reason behind this. \n\nI am fully expecting this review to not be very popular given that I have reviewed it before even getting out of the tutorial; and I am clearly missing something about this game since it is so highly rated. But for me, having not grown up playing this type of game, and from someone who is not able to take in abundant amounts of information and learning the most whacky confusing control scheme, I simply cannot recommend it. It is possibly a generation thing, but if you mostly agree with my reviews and enjoy the same games I do, then you may want to eerie on the side of caution when trying this out as it is simply a game I did not enjoy at all. \n\n[b][u] Tom's Score Card[/u][/b]\n1) Stay away\n[b][u]2) Not Recommended[/u][/b]\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n----\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

It features several dozen different dungeons, some with fixed layout and others randomly generated each time you play.  It also has an 'overworld' adventure map, which was an unique feature in ADOM's young days.\n\nThere are a lot of different character types you can make from a big selection of races and classes who can pursue multiple different endings.  Save the world from ChAoS as a Troll Paladin, or maybe take the place of the elder chaos god Andor Drakon as a Hurthling Farmer? Anything goes.\n\nADOM has always been and will continue to be freeware, downloadable from the developer site adom.de.  Recent features include the graphical Noteye tileset that vastly improves the visual appeal.\n\nOn Steam, the Deluxe version promises a slew of additional features, many of which at the time of this review several months after release have not been realized in the game.  This is a point worthy of critique.  The small development team working on ADOM have always done things in their own pace, which is perfectly fine for a freeware hobby project.  However with a Steam release comes expectations of promises being delivered on.  As much as I love the devs and the wonderful game they've created, this must be pointed out.  While ADOM is a complete game in its own right, the DELUXE version is far from complete.\n\nThat bit of complaining aside, ADOM is a beautiful game.  It is a brutal, oldschool roguelike with such a staggering depth that even with the community wiki on hand, it can take years to uncover all its tricks and secrets.  It will kill hundreds of characters, often just when you felt they were getting somewhere before you can even think about beating the whole game.  It has the replayability for the game to still be addicting to play for all those attempts, with all its character variations and random generated nature.  In fact, I recommend this game not for the story and reaching its ending, but for all the journeys your poor doomed characters embark on before they inevitably get crushed.\n\nIf you like turnbased dungeon crawling, traditional roguelikes with deep systems that you will keep learning new things in even after years of playing, ADOM comes strongly recommended.  However!  I would suggest playing the freeware version on adom.de first.  Unless you just want to support the developers of course (which you should!).  The Deluxe version of the game on Steam doesn't as of yet add much of features to justify a price tag.  Once implemented I think the Steam version will be safely recommended, as well.", "timestamp_created": 1458439681, "timestamp_updated": 1458439756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.733836", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21891340": {"recommendationid": "21891340", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045122045", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "last_played": 1515714141}, "language": "english", "review": "ADOM is the only game that i have played regularly since 1997.

Wrote my own program to auto-backup the saves so I could cheat permadeath when I wanted to. I have played many dungeon crawl games, including Rogue, the OG of the genre. Out of them, this is one of the best. \n\nA large open world (for the genre) full of quests and NPCs. There is plenty to do and see in ADOM as well as a large selection of Class/Race combanations. The mechanics are perfect. This game was created based on PnP rpgs like DnD, and attempts to recreate this as much as possible. There are a ton of hidden rolls, and many are refrenced in the text. The text really makes it feel like a tabletop rpg, well written and really sets the tone.\n\nADOM is also Random and unpredictable. You may die on the way to your first town, killed by enemies you stood no chance against, or kick down a door  to find a large demon ready to rip your head off. With permadeath on it is a hardcore dungeon delvers wet dream come true. This game is hard.\n\nBut now there are options to turn certain features, like permadeath, off. This opens the door for people like me, who enjoy the style, but dont like always playing a hardcore character. It also makes it easier to really enjoy the story and world without fear of losing your character . The graphics are not cutting edge, and I for one am glad. This is the update the game needed. Havent fiddled with the other game modes, but I theres just so much to do. I am also glad development seems to be continueing, so there may be more content to come. \n\nSo there you go, I love this game, totally worth my money.  If you are into old skool Rogue-Likes and value depth over fancy graphics I think you will too.\n\n\n\nps~Thank you Thomas, for all the hours I have played your game over the years, I bought this almost as soon as it came out on steam, and you deserve every penny.

Make your fighter have lots of strength and toughness but little learning\n-Different playstyles: You're wizard doesn't have to wear cloth robes only, have him wear plate armor and attack with weapons (assuming you got the strength for it ;))\n\nGraphics/UI/Music\n-The graphics and UI are very nice looking, especially after this update. The animations are nice as well, and soon there will character customization (I'm really excited for this one)!\n-The UI updated also looks very good (although it does have a tendency to get in the way when your character is at the top of a map. Hopefully this gets fixed soon)\n-The music has also been improved as well, and there are a lot of good tracks in this game\n\nSupport\n-Game is still being supported years after it came out \n-New content is planned even after this new update (new artifacts, levels, quests; Go check out the adom forums or the creators twitter for previews)\n\nWith any good game, there are also some cons:\n\nCons:\nDifficulty\n-When learning how to play, the game can be rather harsh (hunger, corruption, etc.). The difficulty barrier isn't as large as something like Dwarf Fortress, but it is there. You have to be able to learn from your mistakes. If you can't do that, this game might not be for you. If you stick with it though, it's a rewarding game.\n-If you do have problems, the community is quite helpful (as long as you are willing to learn). There is an active adom community in the steam forums as well as in the roguelikes discord chat. Feel free to stop by!\n-You can also turn off certain things like hunger and corruption, or you can also play with reloadable games if you want to play that way\n\nKey Bindings: \n-This game has so much in it, and there are a lot of key bindings that are somewhat unintuitive. If you might not be able to figure it out, it can be quite frustrating. The game does give quick hints now, so its helpful, but this complaint is one I see a lot from negative reviews, and I do agree with it. \n\nBugs:\n-Like many games, there are always going to be bugs you run into, and ADOM is no exception. The game runs quite well, but every now and then you will run into something that might be a problem. If that does happen, be sure to submit a bug report, otherwise they wont be able to be fixed.\n\nTedium:\n-One thing that I might complain about is there is a small amount of tedium in the game. You have be constantly eating, sacrificing for piety, managing inventory, avoiding cats, going to certain areas at certain times etc. It's not a huge deal, as imo it adds an interesting twist to the game. However, it might be a turn off for some people, so I thought I would just bring that up.\n-A lot of knowledge can be found from the adom wiki, which is maintened quite well by the community. \n\nPast these cons, I love this game, and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves roguelikes!\n\nIf you are on the fence about this game, there is a free version you can download from here: http://www.adom.de/home/downloads.html\n\nIt's a much older version, but soon it will be updated with some of the new content.", "timestamp_created": 1454903131, "timestamp_updated": 1509563054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20952757": {"recommendationid": "20952757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203189120", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 138, "last_played": 1515954047}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my absolute favourite rogue like. I have been playing for at least 10 years and the new steam version adds some welcome changes.\n\nI love this game simply because it has all the awsome features you would expect from a roguelike but with a world map.\nThe world map is always the same and features a lot of entrances to dungeons and villages, each being different in sometimes a variety of ways, and for the most part are randomized every game. this leaves you free to pick and choose which quests you want to take. Once you have figured out a lot of the early quests you can choose to skip the ones in which the rewards do not interest you.\n\nMy one criticism of this game is that the religion system sucks. It's not interesting, the rewards for becoming uber pious are kind of lackluster when i consider how grindy and unenjoyable reaching that point is. Fortunately it is not necesary to concern yourself with it. I compare this game in this regard to dungeon crawl and IVAN which both have interesting and fun religion systems.\n\nAnother aspect of this game that i like compared to other roguelikes, such as dungeon crawl, is that the skill system is very rewarding. some skills are passive and just buff your character but others have specific applications.\nyou can pick pockets, pick locks, build bridges, craft arrows, tame animals, brew potions, smith armour...\nFor me this adds a layer of character that helps me role play.\n\nI recomend this game however if you do not have any experience with roguelikes i suggest you do some reading about the genre as this game is brutal and, other than the games basic mechanics, this is mostly a trial by fire. \nI am adamant about not using guides or cheating, however this game is so brutal that despite knowing all i need to know i have never managed to win even a single time despite using the adom guidebook and perusing forums for additional insight.", "timestamp_created": 1454605884, "timestamp_updated": 1454605884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552239", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20879592": {"recommendationid": "20879592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111742109", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450993005}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the idea behind the game but (for me) the control system for movement/fighting was too complex. i have never been much of a hotkey user and playing a game that relies on hotkeys ruined it for me. great game for someone else.", "timestamp_created": 1454268596, "timestamp_updated": 1454268596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519774", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20809540": {"recommendationid": "20809540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011300382", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453151601}, "language": "english", "review": "extremely dated game reskinned with new graphics. controls are clunky and require a lot of memorization. you will probably be frustrated unless you already know the controls from the old game. most of the positive reviews have a lot to do with the nostalgia factor, but this game is extremely hostile to new players.", "timestamp_created": 1454005414, "timestamp_updated": 1454005414, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526315", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20805436": {"recommendationid": "20805436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028439184", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510457738}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing this game since the late 90s.

That is only partly true. The truth is that I've been playing this game since August, 1998. So it's basically like... 17 years. Soon my playtime will be permitted to buy alcohol and smokes. I remember the time when with my best friend we sent a postcard to the creator, Thomas Biskup, because back then ADOM was \"postcard-ware\" - when you wanted to thank the developer, you just had to go to the post office and send a postcard. It is worth every penny considering the game's been free for over 20 years and you can still check the free, older versions at adom.de\n\nNow ADOM is on Steam and for ~15 euro you can experience one of the hardest, most challenging, vague (in terms of \"what should I do now?\") and merciless games of all time. ADOM is one of the legendary roguelike games. That means permadeath after 30hrs of game, that means all your scrolls getting soaked because you forgot to grab that damned blanket, that means drowning, because the ice you created with ice bolt just cracked and you and all your belongings are gone, that means getting burned because one of your fire resistance rings isn't blessed, that means almost crying when you see game message stating: *THUMP*.

I have been playing the ADOM 3 beta and now the final v3.0.6... Man, what a total overhaul and awesome set of improvements! The UI now scales to whatever size screen you have, and it works great on my WQHD Alienware 13R3 to my rMBP to my little tiny GPD Pocket. Next, the simplification of the key commands is huge - it makes the game much easier to play. The sound and graphics/animation are improved, the questing has nice pop up text, and in general everything is much more polished. There are more game modes, etc. This is easily one of the most polished Roguelikes on Steam now - and there is a lot of competition. (Frankly quite a few are also worth playing, a testament to the dedication of their creators and the benefit of us the gamers.)\n\nPrevious Review, October 2016:\n\nAs of the latest beta, R71 in October 2016, I re-purchased this game and have played it a few hours. While I have only played it on an 11\" MacBook Air so far, I can say that all my complaints about the previous version have been addressed. The game looks good and operates properly as soon as you run it. It has a steap learning curve, but that's not entirely unexpected in this sort of game. The tile graphics are reasonably nice.\n\nOriginal Review, December 2015:\n\nThis was the first ever Steam game I returned; it's that bad, at least on my Mac. First, basic computer program sequences didn't work. For example, I couldn't figure out how to quit out of the game and the standard Command-Q and menu items did nothing. I eventually pulled up the \"Force Quit\" menu and killed the program that way (equivalent to kill -9 for Unix users). Second, the fonts and window don't scale properly, and there are about 37,000 settings for these things, none of which produce a nice, usable look and feel on fonts unless you leave the window a tiny thing on the screen. On a 2560x1440 or 1920x1080 screen it is just insanely silly. Third, the tutorial is more annoying than helpful. It randomly pops up a super-small text box that is ridiculously difficult to scroll through telling you things that are generally irrelevant at the time. Sure, it's a roguelike and so there are tons of commands, but at least list them for me in some sort of importance order on the side of the screen or something.\n\nAll in all, I've been playing Roguelikes since, literally, Rogue in the 80s and this was one of the worst experiences ever. I returned the program to Steam and downloaded the free one. I've spent a few hours with the free one and found no way around any of these problems above. If you want a truly great Roguelike to buy here on Steam, look at ToME instead. It's cheaper, easier to learn, much more beautiful, and \"just works.\"", "timestamp_created": 1450619262, "timestamp_updated": 1515206597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481665", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1515444164, "developer_response": "Thanks once more for updating the review.

And take my advice, the tutorial isn't that good, it's better to wiki everything, unless you are really really masochistic and wanna learn everything through dying.\n\nBut once you learn the tricks of the game, it's enormously fun. For example, I kept starving to death, because I didn't realize you could eat corpses and nobody minds. No karma lashbacks, and no getting sick, unless you eat something poisonous. Then I finally got past the third dungeon. That's right, I've died multiple times and still hadn't gotten past that third beginner dungeon. Then I made the mistake of wandering into a random dungeon and getting killed by a room full of giants. \n\nAnyways the perks of this game are:\n 1 it's very difficult, sort of like demon souls. \n2. It's a delight for people who like to imagine what the fights look like instead of seeing it. Like when I accidentally wandered into a water trap with a fluff ball in my backpack and gremlins started appearing out of nowhere. I was like \"Oh, ****\" and they constantly multiplied around my Monk character. Hundreds of dead gremlins later, the floor was flooded with blood and my monk had came through unscathed. \n3. There are many, many, many different ways to play the game. You could be the unarmed monk,(my favorite), the untouchable wizard(too frail in melee for my tastes), or the cunning assassin(kept dying, cuz he doesn't start with heal) and much much more. Apparently there's a race that starts with the spit acid ability or something. \n\nOh well, this reviews getting a bit too long. In short, this is a good game for those willing to put up with how hard core it is and are willing to put up with the ridiculous key mappings.", "timestamp_created": 1450157690, "timestamp_updated": 1450157690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19703132": {"recommendationid": "19703132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084432836", "num_games_owned": 2465, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 111, "last_played": 1515266790}, "language": "finnish", "review": "Aaah, ihana klassikko, siit\u00e4 on jo liian monta vuotta kun t\u00e4t\u00e4 pelasin. 10 pistett\u00e4 ja papukaija merkki Thomakselle. <3", "timestamp_created": 1450137674, "timestamp_updated": 1450137674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532294", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19694870": {"recommendationid": "19694870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043105200", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455737144}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely loved the original, pure ASCII version. played it for years (won it twice...)\nSaw it on Steam, bought it... just found out, it cannot be played in offline mode?!?

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of indie rogue-like Ancient Domains of Mystery (ADOM). ADOM was released on November 16, 2015 on Steam by a team headed by Thomas Biskup, including: Jochen Terstiege, Zeno Rogue, Krzysztof Dycha & Lucas Dieguez. \n\n(NOTE: This review was produced by using a key for the game that was provided by the Developer/Publisher)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zMMjOCStQfE\n\nThe \"Too Long, Didn't Watch\" Review:\n\nSTEEP learning curve. Sky high difficulty. Permadeath. TON of replayability. Short on Graphics, Audio.\n3/5 but a MUST if you're a rogue-like fan. \n\n\nThe \"Meat & Potatoes\" Review:\n\nThis has been a very difficult game for me to review. It is a solid game. I am totally getting the hang of it just fine and enjoy the genre. However, these controls are still stuck in 1994. The graphics and sound are too. But wait, there is a LOT more to this game. First, the character creation alone is immensely deep. It's really great. Oh sure, you can randomize your hero/anti-hero (yup, you can be evil. why not?), their class, race, stats. You can also choose them yourself. There are quite a few to choose from. Even better, you go through a nice little quiz (or you can randomize this too) to determine some things about your character. This makes for tons of different combos and ways to play the game. I absolutely LOVE this aspect of this game. It is straight RPG with it's abilities, talents, etc. right down to rating them by dice roll and modifier. The controls though. It takes a long time to master these controls. SO much going on all over the keyboard. I feel like some of this could be somewhat simplified, but maybe I am wrong. There really is an crazy amount of depth to this little rogue-like. Fully fleshed out tons and NPC's to be found. All in all, for your average gamer there is a lot to consume here. This is not light gaming at all. More like a Paradox game or Wargaming (a la Ageod games, etc.) there is a lot to master before being able to fully enjoy this game. As you unlock all of this though, it is very rewarding. \n\n\nAvg. gamer score would rate out at a 2/5.

I had played it before the kickstarted campaign for the graphical version and had enjoyed it then, and I enjoy it now even more. It just offers a lot of depth and complexety, I can really dive into the game. The world really feels alive. I also enjoyed TOME, the other great classical roguelike, but somehow I always preferred ADOM. TOME just feels more like game, with its MMO-like skills, while ADOM has the typical quirkiness and complexety of games like nethack, just with a persistent overworld and an actual story, which for me is more immersive.\n\nI like the music, the tilesets and the many possible options, the mouse control. The loading times are pretty much non-existent, which isn't the case for TOME for example. But it still expects much the users to use the non-intuitive outdated old keyboard-shortcuts.\n\nADOM is hard and unforgiving. The new ingame tutorial doesn't change that. I would recommend reading the beginners guides on the wiki and the ingame manual. It's a game for people who have a lot of patience and are prepared to die early. I contrast to most rogue-lites and also many roguelikes, such as TOME, I always grow attached to my characters, so having them die is even more painful.\n\nTl;dr: ADOM is still one of the best games for roguelike fans who like depth and are prepared to die a lot and I am positvely surprised of the technical overhaul. But it's still nothing for people who simply want to explore a world and don't like reading manuals. \n", "timestamp_created": 1449016475, "timestamp_updated": 1449016475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19425796": {"recommendationid": "19425796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261245776", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 81, "last_played": 1516450987}, "language": "english", "review": "I learned the basics of this game about 1,5 years ago and have since then been playing it fairly regularly. Haven't managed to finish one yet, but the great thing about this game is that it doesn't really matter that much. It's not about winning. It's about your character, that you'll be scared for, that you'll pray for, that you'll coddle up and train. You'll be angry at fate, god or just the rng, you'll laugh at stupid deaths, you'll get surges of adrenaline at the sight of that out-of-depth monster around the corner and be immensely relieved when you make it to the next staircase without being followed. Pride when you get out of a situation that looked completely desperate by using your wits, disbelief when you finally identify your stuff and see that you've been carrying around 2 (!!) amulets of life saving, anger at yourself when you lose that really promising character just because you didn't stop playing in time (when you noticed your eyes started itching and your vision got a bit blurry, but hey, you just couldn't leave the game at that point, no way...)\nI'm really no game expert, I don't have any comparison to other roguelikes or any other computer games for that matter.

Enemies falling under your blows left and right, it doesn't even matter what type of beast you just encountered, they all go down just after one or two blows from your greatsword. You happily hoard treasures while mumbling something about having no real challenge. Then as you raid another of the countless rooms you suddenly see a ghost. Easy you think, you fought many of these and they are more annoying than anything. But then pops up another and another and another... a whole horde of ghosts. You fight but it's no use, each time you slay one, several others drain you with their touch. You turn to run but you cannot navigate the the tight corridors as well as these incorporeal beings. It is only a few seconds from there that you drop dead... drained till you collapse of old age.\nThat's one way an ADOM game goes.\n\nIn another you are a powerful mage, having no trouble burning, freezing or electrifying whatever you encounter. That is until you meet an enemy that commands even greater magical powers and easily no-sells whatever your arsenal of spells throws at it. What now? Drink a potion? Use a scroll? Run? Too late in any case. As the only tunnel leading away from the enemy already has an angry giant blocking it. Struggle or go out swinging?\nAnd that's another way an ADOM game may go.\n\nBut perhaps you won't even be this lucky, you might be a looser who eats the first kobold, realizes his error once vomiting the contents of their stomach and then be unfortunate enough to meet a ghul, becoming paralyzed by its touch and choking on your own vomit.\n\nOr you'll explode attempting to perform alchemy. Or you'll get bit by something poisonous and realize that without antidotes you're just on a timer to your death. Or you'll read a cursed book at a VERY bad time. Or you'll decide to stand on an obsidian altar while a particularly religious orc is in the same room. Or if you're really lucky you'll live long enough to die attempting to challenge a physical god.\n\nIn short ADOM is great for creating an emergent mini story of your own character's struggle (and likely death), offering a ton of freedom and depth, but also demanding patience, dedication and application of one's own brain to learn the game. Those who can handle it can expect a deep and rewarding experience as it is a much bigger achievement to beat superpowered bad guy when you're just a frail mortal who can be blown away at every wrong step.\n\nNow if the game had more polish in terms of graphics and animation and a much friendlier UI I'd have no trouble to recommend it to pretty much everyone, if only for the hillarious ways one can meet their demise.

Un petit bijou vid\u00e9oludique, qui ressemble pas mal \u00e0 mon jeux pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 (Tales of maj'eyal, TOME,  pour ne pas le nommer). C'est un magnifique Rogue-like.\n\nUn petit avertissement tout de m\u00eame: ADOM c'est comme une voiture. Il faut apprendre \u00e0 l'utiliser. Et au d\u00e9but c'est difficile, on pense qu'on y arrivera jamais. Puis apr\u00e8s, comme pour le voiture, on fait 50km en pensant \u00e0 ce qu'on va faire \u00e0 manger, et la voiture se pilote automatiquement.\nADOM c'est pareil. Les commandes sont assez barbares. En plus il y'en a des dizaines (marcher, parler, prier, tremper des objets dans l'eau, envoyer des sors, utiliser des torches, manger, etc... etc... etc...).\nIl ne faut pas se laisser intimider par ces commandes barbares. Elles deviendront \u00e0 99% automatique.\n\nAttention encore \u00e0 une chose, ADOM ne vous prend pas par la main. Je ne vous cache pas qu'au d\u00e9but vous ne saurez pas trop ou aller, dans quel ordre aborder les dongeons. Alors l\u00e0 il y'a 2 \u00e9coles:\n1 l'exp\u00e9rimentation. A force d'essais et d'erreurs, vous aurez une bonne id\u00e9e du parcours \u00e0 faire (ou \u00e0 \u00e9viter).\n2 Le wiki d'ADOM. Il est super bien fait. Et il permet aux impatients (comme moi) de gagner un peu de temps au d\u00e9but.\n\nDerni\u00e8re chose, le jeu est en anglais. A ma connaissance pas de patch FR. Mais il y'a vraiment peu de texte \u00e0 lire (surtout description des sors et des talents). Un niveau d'anglais tr\u00e8s basique est largement suffisant pour profiter \u00e0 100% d'ADOM.\n\nBon voil\u00e0, c'\u00e9tait les c\u00f4t\u00e9 \"n\u00e9gatifs\" du titre. Maintenant pour le reste.... Ben c'est que du positif.\nD\u00e9ja la dur\u00e9e de vie... A 30h de jeux, j'en suis au d\u00e9but du jeux (je commence \u00e0 survivre r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement jusqu'\u00e0 la ville des nains). Et je prends un immense plaisir \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir les subtilit\u00e9 du jeux.\nLes diff\u00e9rentes classes sont int\u00e9ressantes, et il y'en \u00e0 vraiment bcp.\n\nEn plus n'\u00e9tant pas du tout un habitu\u00e9 des jeux de r\u00f4le \u00e0 l'ancienne, je d\u00e9couvre aussi le syst\u00e8me d'alignement (loyal, neutre, chaotique), ainsi que le syst\u00e8me d'objets bennis/maudits/non-maudits.\nC'est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant.\n\nFranchement ADOM c'est comme TOME. On y pense toute la journ\u00e9e, et on se jette dessus d\u00e8s qu'on rentre \u00e0 la maison.\nTr\u00e8s peu de jeux m'ont fait cet effet dans ma vie.\nEn parlant de TOME, il y'a une diff\u00e9rence notable avec ADOM. La gestion de l'inventaire. Dans ADOM, l'inventaire n'est pas illimit\u00e9. Et il d\u00e9pend de la force du personnage. Il y'a aussi la gestion (basique) de la faim.\nM\u00eame si cette gestion de la faim est probl\u00e9matique dans les premi\u00e8res heures du jeux, une fois les bases assimil\u00e9es, ce n'est plus un probl\u00e8me.\n\nLe nombre d'ennemis est tr\u00e8s vari\u00e9 pour le moment (je suis au \"d\u00e9but\" du jeux). Et j'en ai rencontr\u00e9 des dizaines de diff\u00e9rents. Humano\u00efdes, b\u00eates, insectes, dragons, d\u00e9mons et autres machins fantastiques font parties du zoo ADOM,\nLe nombre d'objets est aussi impressionants. Batons, haches, \u00e9p\u00e9es, dagues, massues, arcs, fouets, etc... etc... etc... \nA ce sujet un petit regret. Notre \u00e9quipement n'est pas toujours repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sur notre perso. Certains objet le sont, d'autres non... \n\n\nBon, j'ai assez perdu de temps. Je repars dans affronter les dongeons obscurs d'ADOM !

There is a small list of reasons, but it comes down to the fact that the game just isn't much fun.  Perhaps that's a symptom of being 'roguelike', perhaps not.  \n\nPros\n- easy to get started, play a while and then stop.  ei no load times, no startup ads to watch, no fancy graphic splash screen\n\nCons\n-  Vast majority of games end in you dying.  Since this is permadeath all the time invested is lost.  Period.\n- Most of the things that kill young characters (hunger, traps you can't detect on doors you must go through), poisons you can't cure, monsters that one-hit-kill and who are also faster than you are) you have no possibility of avoiding.  The game doesn't attempt to balance things, it mostly just rolls RNG's and eventually you die.\n - Your character rarely knows anything about the equipment/potion/buffs.  You could die with a potion of healing in your possession and have no possibility of finding out.\n - Even if you choose a class that allows you to see cursed/uncursed status, the game has undetectable cursed items to saddle your character with usless sh*t.\n - Game does a very poor job at allowing balanced characters.\n - Too many things completely invulnerable to player attacks/spells, and very little chance to determine what could be effective against them before you die.\n - If you need something (food particularly, healing, a decent weapon, an identify scroll) you will never find it.  If you don't need it, the stuff drops like rain.  And of course this lack is going to kill you.\n\nPretty much the game is more of a fancy RNG, rather that someting that is fun.   Some will find this fun, most people will find it frustrating and unrewarding.  And the fact that it kills you repeatedly without any possibilty of not dying makes it more fruitless.", "timestamp_created": 1448669356, "timestamp_updated": 1448669356, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.384013", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19318496": {"recommendationid": "19318496", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213449817", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448241420}, "language": "english", "review": "way to dtinkin complicated  for my simple mind ......   people who feel theres never enough detail or things to consider   this is for you, not me", "timestamp_created": 1448659209, "timestamp_updated": 1448659209, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.329026", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19310838": {"recommendationid": "19310838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080640211", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458329437}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played ADOM more than any other game: on and off over the span of 18 (!) years.\n\nThe game's complex dynamics, rich world and variety keep me coming back.

For some reason it isn't on here, so I'm trying again.\n\nThis game is to roguelikes what Baldur's Gate is to CRPGs. After playing for over ten years, I can safely say that this is one of the best games I've ever played. The reason for this is it's strict dedication to its core mechanic -- you, dying.\n\nOne of the best descriptions I've ever heard of game mechanics was concerning Dark Souls, in that (paraphrased) \"this is a game that is fair to the player -- always FAIR -- and the difficulty does not surprise you if you pay attention.\"\n\nADOM is like this. Sort of. Instead of there being ways to see what's ahead and then killing you a la Dark Souls, ADOM's core mechanic isn't actually dying. That's the means to teaching you. You will suffer legitimate losses of equipment, stats, companions, or everything you have in a gripping, slow or numbing, painless death. Then, you are expected - required - to learn from that experience in your next character.\n\nThis shows in everything that the game does. RPG classes in 99% of RPGs are meaningless. In ADOM, some are similar to eachother, but every class has at least one unique quality to them that will change the entirety of the game. Races are the same, with each having a sort of opposite, such as the Mist Elves and Trolls; M.Elves have unstoppable magical capabilities and dodging, but Trolls have towering health WITH regeneration (the MOST coveted skill in the game) and can massacre just about anything (can I just say Troll weaponsmith w/sword of sharpness? Yes, I CAN say that!) (... right before I died).\n\nI've been playing off and on, but the adventures have been memorable. I was introduced to the game by scumming and knew too little to understand that this was NOT as the game was designed. Once I found the ADOM Guidebook online, I started playing rogue (with a little experimentation). My first winning playthrough was a Human Fighter, Phaeton; he ran into a vault of Greater Molochs. It took me HOURS to kill just one, but once I did, my level rocketed and I was able to kill each one easier until my 100 Courage could take on 2-3 at a time, hitting lvl50 in no time. The Balors at the end nearly killed me, but I desperately used a scroll of familiar summoning and hit the jackpot -- a Greater Flame Elemental killed literally everything but me on the entire floor. I just followed it around and picked through the carnage. My second playthrough was a Wizard, Gafgarion, that died in the duel with Nuurag-Vaarn. When 1.2.0 was released, I dove in head first with a LOT of attempts, but finally got a High Elven Paladin, Matthias, and for the first time I got Justifier. For those who don't know, this may be one of the best non-minmax occurrences in the game. I edited my sprite to epic proportions, turning Justifier into the Master Sword from Zelda, and mopped through every dungeon. You think such imbalance isn't fun after while... until your save loads a JSON error and corrupts, thereby losing everything.\n\nNow that I'm done rambling, here's what makes this Steam version special. You can remove all of what I just talked about. However, that's not such a bad thing. What the Steam release signifies is a willingness to accept new players. The depth and complexity of content in ADOM is such that I probably haven't seen half of it. And it's probably only going to get bigger. Therefore, it makes sense to have ways to let players explore it. There's still tons wrong with it, as one review brought up the online-only functionality. This doesn't really bother me. Unless he's travelling in the bush (doubtful), turn on hotspot on your phone for 5 mins. The act of getting ADOM on Steam in a saleable format was probably a Herculean task, and so I expect errors. Any aspersions against customer sales disrespect are fallacious and made by people who have clearly never perused the forums or seen comments made by Thomas Biskup. Since Morrowind modding, I have never seen such a dedicated community of collaborative effort.\n\nIt has never been a better age to get into roguelikes, and this game is one of the best.

The dread beast that inflicted the wounds upon you lies smoldering before you, the last of your power expended upon its ruin.  Through the doorway that led you to this chamber, you hear a thunderous 'HARUMPH'.  This can only mean ruin.  You frantically search your belongings, desperate for salvation.  You pray to your God, but the ground quakes at your request, a stern denial from your patron deity.  A tremendous stomping grows nearer, and you fear that your time is short.  Sweat pouring down your bleeding face, you find a Wand of Digging in your pack, intact but depleted of charges, alongside your Wand of Door Creation.  Like a man gone mad, you plunge the Wand of Digging into your only potion of Booze, and cry out when the wand glows once more.  You fire it behind you, creating a vast tunnel wherein you dash for safety.  You zap your Wand of Door creation behind you, and with your faintly regained power Magically Lock the summoned door.  You run down your new corridor, seeking escape, only to find another dead end.  The impossibly heavy steps of the impending creature grow close now, as you huddle in the corner of your shelter.  The steps cease, you hold your breath in sheer terror, silently attempting to gather yourself in meditation and regain power.  An explosion of splinters erupts from the other side of your corridor, and the many eyed horror that approaches from the gloom freezes you in your place.  You think of Terinyo as the horror steps toward you, you think of the home you left behind.  Your fear gives way to darkness, the darkness to silence; Ancardia's greatest hope extinguished like a torch in the rain.'\n\nYou die.  You survive.  You learn. ADOM is a game that offers you a canvas upon which to design your own adventure.  Are you a hero?  A villain?  Do you aspire to seal the forces of Chaos away, or reign over it a mad God for eternity?  Are you a simple farmer, far from home?  A gambler, seeking the highest stakes casino in all the world?  Call it a roguelike, call it a fantasy role playing sandbox, call it a sadistic RNG exercise, ADOM is all that and far more.  No experience is perfect, games crash, characters are lost.  ADOM is mysterious, and you may puzzle at the Scroll of Dark Predictions in your inventory, or the Tract of Chaos you see on the ground.  You may wander to the Tower of Eternal Flames, and enter without caution.  You die.  You survive.  You learn.  ADOM is a game of mystery, a game of skill, a game of chance.  Distinct from its peers, beloved by its fanbase, and better than ever here on Steam.

You need to be patient and learn/ list lots of commands on the keyboard.\n\n\nI first played ADOM around 2003-2004. We had a crappy computer which couldn't handle many games at all, but my brother had ADOM on it. I tested it and was instantly hooked: So much to explore, so hard! Only one life? The merciless roguelike system where the game is permanently over when you die made me curious.\n\nThe added graphics are quite nice addition to the game and I imagine it's easier for new players to get into the game. I use only the keyboard controls for the game, as it is much faster (and I've played it for years so it comes natural). I recommend tackling the keyboard commands if you want faster gameplay.\n\nThere are so many ways you can be good (or bad) at this game. The game has been around for decades so it is well-balanced, but also still very challenging. I haven't still finished this game without \"cheating\", that is what was known as save scumming, where you copy the save file in case you die and continue game from there. I died just once to a stupid mistake which I don't remember anymore, but it still annoys me, even after multiple years. I'm fully determined to finish ADOM in the near future...\nIn a nutshell, the reasons I enjoy playing ADOM:\n- Challenging enough\n- Addictive - you'll probably end up screaming like a maniac for dying, swear you had enough ADOM for a week, only to find yourself trying a new character 10 minutes later\n- Variable - Dozens, if not hundreds of ways to play the game (race, class combinations + different endings, quests to pursue, places to visit)\n- Unpredictable - You might get mighty lucky early in the game, or really unlucky (dying to a random stone block trap early on for example), or both at the same, or neither. Just like life!\n- Bang for your buck - If you end up liking this game, you will probably enjoy it for years - I estimate that I have played more than 1000 hours pre-steam\n\nIf you decide to buy the game: Don't totally spoil yourself reading guides beforehand - just go to places, explore them and read late-game guides only if you get stuck to some place.

Its one of those \"two-and-a-half to three stars' moments. \n\nNow I have to explain that I'm one of those people who were playing ADOM since early-days. I spent countless hours and spent dozens on dozens of characters to their eventual deaths. And that is something you have to get used to in this game. Your characters die. When they die, they're gone for good. Shiny gear. Nifty abilities. Everything. Gone. The only thing you'll have to remember them by is their entry on your personal high score board reminding you that your best character died on level 5 of some hole in the field because he/she died of the black plague because you ate a kobold corpse on the ground. \n\nI'm resisting the urge to ramble on and on here. ADOM really is a good game! Its wonderfully complex yet simple in its premise. There is no real story involved. 'Go and fight Chaos'. They drop you on the world and wish you good luck. The overworld is always the same. And the dungeons you dive into are always random. But this time, instead of the ASCII characters representing yourself, enemies, and items on the ground, you have a nifty little graphical representation. And in the 'old' game, you had to memorize a LOT of hotkeys, as combinations of letters with alt/shift/ctrl were what you had to press to perform actions and bring up menus. \n\nBut that's the rub. The GUI (that's Graphical User Inferface), in my opinion, is about 75% of what you're buying here. Yes, there are a few different modes you can play in. Yes, you can now play by using the mouse and right-clicking to bring up a menu of things you can do instead of remembering its keystroke to make it more forgiving for newbies learning how to get around - though the game itself can still be brutal. But when you get down to brass tacks, you're buying cosmetics. \n\nThat's why I wavered on the tumbs up and tumbs down. I love ADOM. It's a relic from junior high through college for me.

I don't personally care for the graphical version, but being a fan of skyrim and fallout, I can also understand the longing for something more than ASCII characters moving around.\n\nI also highly recommend checking out the wikia.  The world of Ancardia is so full and detailed, that it will help you immensely to look up your class and race to see what fun specialties they afford you!  Many have fun skills you can only have as certain races.  Be prepared to immerse yourself and realize how much fun the game can be! \n\n*Disclaimer:\nThere are absolutely traps in this game!  Dr VectorX is in no way responsible for damages caused by in-game traps.  Damage liability waiver includes: burning, freezing, falling, impalement by spear, impalement by arrow, crushing by giant rocks, spawning of giant golems, death by rats, death by wolves, death by acid, death by explosion, death by confusion leading to falling down a hole, death by teleportation into a deadly mob of feral pixies who tear you to pieces after you comment about how tasty the remains of their brethren are, death by spawning of <color> dragon, death by starvation, death by water causing all the gremlin cotton balls to reconstitute and mob you for not cleaning your pockets, death by being eaten by a grue, death by drinking a random unknown pool of liquid and effects thereof, death by zombie, death by ninja, death by dwarf, death caused by mud in the face, death from not knowing how to wipe ones face, death from clean ears, death by metal poisoning, death by curse, death caused by riches, i.e. over abundance of gold pieces, death from drinking a potion you foolishly didn't identify, death accidentally bouncing magic off a wall and catching yourself in the never ending ricocheting magic, and any other magic related deaths.  All complaints should be directed to the Creator hotline.\n\nEDIT (11/18/15):\n\nThe game currently has stability issues with the steam version.  Because I like this game so much and I want people to be able to see how good this game is without the unfortunate launch day issues that plague many games (squinty glare at CoD), I want to inform everyone that they may try ADOM for FREE.  The only catch is that the releases are not the latest ones.  However, they are stable and STEAM free.  You can find them on the link below.\n\nhttp://www.adom.de/home/downloads.html\n\nYou can download BOTH the graphical UI version AND the ASCII version.

Allow me to start likening it to other games.\n\nIn spite of the fact that it takes up about the same amount of space on your Hard Drive as Five Nights At Freddy's, it's story, lore, and gameplay are almost as deep as the land of Tamriel's. Gameplay is smooth, and the controls, while beyond numerous, are simple, and easy to understand. The downside is the difficulty. I have been playing it for years, and I have never beaten it. Namely, this is because I tend to have a Throw-Myself-At-Anything strategy, and if you are not careful, this can lead to you having a bad day really quick. Couple the fact that this game comes standard with PermaDeath, and you really want to be careful how you play. Imagine Dark Souls with the Skyrim Dead is Dead mod installed. Pretty hardcore. In addition, the game has at least six different endings. Multiple quests, endless, randomly generated dungeons, with a few of them literally infinite in size. An expansive, MASSIVE overworld that is bigger than the size of Oblivion. Random encounters in the wild with numerous creatures to face, from bandits to jackals to the Brotherhood of Chaos to hill giants. A simplistic, incredibly fun game with an incredible lore. You have multiple races, and multiple classes to pick from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Pray to the gods for assistance, but don't abuse their generosity. And with Talents, you can customize your ratling fencer to be unique from other Ratling Fencers you may create, leading to an admittedly still finite, but very, very, VERY large pool of possible combinations. This is a game 22 years in the making, and it has managed to stay true to it's roots, while at the same time become attractive to a newer audience.

Buy food if you didn't start with much, and especially have food for long treks through the wilderness. Anyone can put a madman out of his misery - a true hero will find a way to heal him. Giant inscects have hard shells, and you may need to swing like a berserker to cut through. Your first mindcrafter will be killed by a stone block; do not be angry when this happens.

This title can certainly hold its own right up  there with the best of modern games. Some may have you believe a single person (Thomas Biskup) built this, but as is stated in the credits, the end product is the result of thousands of peoples hard work and ideas.

Yes, it is FUN.[/b]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Timeless game that has been shaped over 20 years, which is reflected by system complexity that goes unmatched in modern games.\n+The ability to seemlessly (simply push F10) switch between classic ASCII and tiles.\n+Tiles and music are beautifully done.\n+Many modes that are all well recieved.

When I select my character by clicking him, the menu won't pop up, and I will be stuck.  Have to hard reset the game to restart the game.  I've had to hard reset like over a dozen times, and since it is a 'roguelike' game there is no save of my character, and a self save takes me back to the main screen (annoying).\n\nFun game though w/ tons of characters and classes to play.  Pretty basic like other games like Hammerwatch imo, w/o multiplayer which is a shame.  Typical hack in slash that is strongly keyboard based though.  Game is probably slightly overpriced, and worth probably in the 9.99 for the basic overall quality of the game (there really is no soundtrack for example).\n\nWhat is cool, is you get to play a combo of tons of races and classes (that should be more previlent in more fantasy genre games like this one), but are not.  For instance I love playing a Troll Barbarian.\n\nThis game I guess is a bit old there are some indie strat guides out there to help you select your character and to explain stuff (like selling stuff requires you to go into the merchant shop and drop the item on the shop floor, lol weird), and in that regard, the game seems overall unpolished compared to the price point which it is at imo.\n\n----\n\nAfter playing more hours and seeing the dev reply to the game, let me expand my review some more.\n\nThis is the typical game that falls into \"challenging\" and tries to prey on perhaps the nostalgic feelings of those who maybe played this game in the past.\n\nGranted I like challenging games, but realistically you will get 3-7 hours of frustrating fun.\n\nI found it extremely difficult to get past the southern dungeon on my way past the map.  \n\nAll dungeon maps are always rectangular in nature, vary very little; granted they seem to be using a random seed of some kind, but after 3-4 times it gets stale.  There are torches on the wall, other than that, there is no decor.  Character animations are limited and are only left face and right face.  Also when I equip certain equipment like the helm it is barely visible or not visible at all.\n\nThere is no soundtrack, the ambience sound is almost non-existent.  Occasionally I hear the drop of into a puddle in a dungeon.  Again, the atmosphere of the game feels incomplete.\n\nThere are TONS of games similar to this, Gauntlet $19.99 (when not on sale, 2015 game) (http://store.steampowered.com/app/258970/ ) is a popular game my friends play that has a multiplayer aspect, which this game does not have.  Also Hammerwatch $9.99 (not on sale) which does exist, unlike what the Dev has said and exists here on Steam:  http://store.steampowered.com/app/239070/\n\n\nLet me describe a small experience I had playing a Troll Barbarian, which granted is pretty cool since most games fall short of providing the race/class combo which games like this should have (orignally stated above).  I roll this toon, spec into two handed weapons, and I go into the trial dungeon, first door is locked, I can only kick it down, in the process of kicking the door down my huge club is broke, lol wtf ok.  So basically your skill that you used to get the 2hed item is worthless and now you have to punch guys.\nOverall sound effects are stale, limited, and lackluster, and could be improved dramatically.\nIf you are going to bring back a game from 1995 update date, improve it a ton.  Check out Divinity Original Sin (http://store.steampowered.com/app/373420/), a game which was just enhanced w/ over 90+ hours of gameplay and fully AAA voiced acted.\nSpell casters feel bulky and there is not hotkey menu like modern games have (again you are paying for a 1995 1st addition D&D type game).  I have to constantly hit he escape menu to break away from the immersion of the game to open a spellbook.  After some casting of the spells they are \"forgotton\" (no tutorial on this at all btw, to explain this to first time players of ADOM like myself), and I have to relearn them.  Which means you have to worry about carrying 100 stone tombs everywhere you go.  This is a problem if you play a gnome mage (which I tried out), and tried carrying around 5 tombs plus heavy rations.\nCertain classes have to eat CONSTANTLY like the game should be renamed \u201ciron ration buffet\u201d as trolls have to eat 1-2 every dungeon level.  Since food weighs a TON certain races are bogged down w/ carrying capacity issues (which only mildly exists as a nuisance in other games).\n\nOn the flip side I like rolling a quick character and just smashing through enemies in the dungeons.  But other games have this pleasure of smashing AI units into the ground.\nAlso initial encounters past the first town can kill you very easily.  You see the theme here?  This game has a HUGE learning curve w/ 8bit graphics.  Time/reward/money do not align that well.\n\nWhy are the rations so heavy in this game? And not proportion to the character size, again another design flaw.\n\nThis game is geared towards probably ppl who are in the 30s.  Why pay for this game when you can get far superior games for roughly 1-2x the price.  Although if you want to step into a time machine and try to play and relive the sweet memories when you were 8 years old on your Commodore.\n\nI feel like this game is a semi money grab at the nostalgic feels of old time gamers who played this game and who want to shell out $ for these feels.\n\nAfter being frustrated for the last time, I uninstalled.\n\nFunny, when a long time bud on Steam who saw me playing this game on messaged me:\n\n\"2015 >> azbolg still playing shit games\"\n\nThis game is a solid 4 / 10.", "timestamp_created": 1447742382, "timestamp_updated": 1447860132, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.176441", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19125221": {"recommendationid": "19125221", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995633765", "num_games_owned": 704, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 60, "last_played": 1515743919}, "language": "english", "review": "0.)

How to review ADOM? Well, it's one of the Great Few, an actual roguelike (not roguelikelike or light or anything) that helped define the genre. ADOM's strongest points are a mix of a persistent plot with procedurally generated elements, and a much deeper lore than its kin.\n\nOnce again the ultimate evil raises its ugly head and only a single hero can defeat it because fate says so. That hero is you. Or, will be you. Eventually you will defeat evil. But before that, you will die. A lot. And then again, and then some more. And you'll probably love every single death because you learned something, or had the chance to try out a new trick, or just had a brief moment of clarity how something COULD be done, only you didn't do it.\n\nADOM \"Steam\" is a pretty huge package. While the original game can be played for free, this version comes with a nice set of \"deluxe\" options and, seriously, this is a game that has been around for ages. I played it for ages. I think it's fair that at some point someone gets a bit of my money for the entertainment I had, because this is a game made for old dogs like me. A perfect throwback to my teen years, not pimped out until it's no longer the game I learned to love but with a nice, sensible lick of paint and a sleek interface. And I can still have it all in ASCII if I want.\n\nThere's just no way not to recommend this game. \nIf you already know it, you want to buy it for the same reasons I did: For nostalgia, for running the dungeons again, for feeling the thrill of a fight where each move matters, for smiling at the fact that your Steam Playtime can never, ever, match the hours you already sunk into this monster.\nIf you never heard of ADOM, you want to try it out because it is a nicely structured, engrossing game that polishes some concepts of the genre to a silky sheen. You'll appreciate the interface, which is readable but doesn't get in your way, you'll start out small and then you'll be hooked.\n\nAll this said, it's still a roguelike. As in, one of the games that took care we HAVE roguelikes. There are many things here that are part of the genre but not to everyone's taste- a fairly rocky early game, permadeath, TONS of ways to die yeat another stupid death, and an omnipresent element of randomness that can, and will, screw you up big time at least once per run. ADOM doesn't pull any punches and you need to be aware of that, this is not a recent rogue-light, this is bedrock. If you are just curious what the craze is all about, you may want to try the free version, just to see how it sits with you. \n\nBecause like most old roguelikes, ADOM is a game that rewards patience, planning, developing strategies and preparing for the worst- while still allowing players to improvise and come out of a tight spot with some sweet experience and a new trick in their book. \n\n15 Euros can buy you more recent, visually impressive, or (to be honest) more streamlined games after all, but ADOM takes time to master, and beating it once is nothing, considering the endless replayability the genre itself has to offer.\n\nHappy dungeon-dwelling, spell-singing and corpse-cursing!", "timestamp_created": 1447728635, "timestamp_updated": 1447728635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531560", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19122483": {"recommendationid": "19122483", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970153763", "num_games_owned": 569, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 3976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509608841}, "language": "english", "review": "HIGH quality roguelike, great game!", "timestamp_created": 1447722523, "timestamp_updated": 1447722523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499985", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19122122": {"recommendationid": "19122122", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987270895", "num_games_owned": 818, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 4768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515279612}, "language": "english", "review": "After 10 years - give or take - Ancient Domains of Mystery still wakes that primal excitement in this quite cynical gamer. \n\nADOM is one of the first true roguelikes among Nethack and the like but was the only one of those that made me sit on my chair, scratching my hair with the decisions the game made me do, or the sheer amount of options it presented. I was stunned that you really needed almost the whole keyboard to play the game and it sure took time to learn most of the quirks. Back then the game was presented in ASCII aka by symbols like letters and numbers. Plain 'g' for goblin and 'k' for kobold.\n\nThis new Steam version has graphics in form of a tileset tho, so you don't have to learn how to \"read\" the game first even though it doesn't remove the fact that you still have to master them buttons. I think the tileset is very decent taking concideration the scale of the game and the amount of classes/races/weapons/etc there is. \n\nThe UI sure feels clunky though and I recomend taking your time to read through everything the first time. After generating few characters and painfully losing them you'll surely get the hang of it and the gameplay get's much smoother and faster. It's not as difficult as Dwarf Fortress but in a whole new level compared to i.e. Dungeons of Dredmor if that helps anything. \n\nI might add and edit the review if needed but for now I just wanted to welcome my old friend to Steam and give it a nice 9/10 review.", "timestamp_created": 1447720339, "timestamp_updated": 1447720339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472936", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19121864": {"recommendationid": "19121864", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982293787", "num_games_owned": 1187, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 2334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514827837}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the cornerstone Roguelikes, lovingly enhanced for steam and the modern era.

To describe it as \"hard\" would be both true and misleading: It's actually very easy to play and very easy to make a lot of progress, but actually winning is a delicate and unlikely affair. Dying is practically inevitable and although in the \"Deluxe\" version it's possible to turn off perma-death it's certainly not in the spirit of the game to do so. I can't even begin to enumerate the number of games I've played but I've saved well over a hundred memorials to \"notable\" dead characters on this computer alone. I have only approached the approximate half-way point twice, I have never come close to winning... and still I play, because what keeps me coming back is the variety and the challenge.\n\nThis is not a game you will win in a weekend, or a month, or a year, but you will enjoy every session (right up to the moment you die). I encourage you, dear reader, to cough up the meager sum that is asked here for this gem and immerse yourself in a wonderful game in which the developer has truly Thought Of Everything. If mud splashes on your face it blinds you until you wipe it away. If it's dark or you're illiterate you can't read books or scrolls; if you're deaf you can't hear what NPCs say to you, but the wail of a banshee will also not affect you. Sometimes kicking things breaks them, sometimes it just hurts your leg. You can eat the raw corpse of a hurthling but it will taste better and sustain you longer if you cook it first.  The texture and depth is incredible and, thanks to randomly generated elements, your choice of race, class and winning strategy it's never quite the same twice.\n\nFor new players I recommend three things: Patience, determination, and to avoid standing directly in front of doors when opening them.

I've been excited ever since the crowdfunding campaing, and been singing praises of this game ever since. It's brutal, hard and random, yes, but such is the nature of TRUE rogue-likes. \n\nDeluxe version gives you the options to lower the difficulty for more casual of players, so they can get enjoyment out of this game as well. Even giving you option to properly save your game, unlike the normal mode, where your game save is tied to your characters life, once character dies, it's gone. This is something not available in the free version. More on that later.\n\nBut the true meat of this game comes from flexibility of the combat... You have your basic Melee, Ranged and Magic attacks, but you also can use Mindcraft, companions, special race/class abilities and alchemy to name a few varied methods of dealing damage. But you can in turn take damage from ridiculous stuff among others, and get killed in many, many ways, including getting crushed by dungeon, whipping yourself to death, getting sacrificed to one of many gods, having too much stuff in your inventory and my personal favorite: Getting eaten by grue. Also, you can get killed before you even move (or take your first step) with certain race/class combinations on certain day.\n\nThere are plenty of static elements in game that stay same from game to game, but majority of the dungeons are randomly generated, keeping you on your toes every time. No two games are the same, which makes this game highly replayable.\n\nDeluxe version of ADOM is not only worth your money, but as it gets more features, which will keep coming until the Creator of this game feels this game is complete (and moves onto the Sequel) makes this game truly worthwhile. But if you are not certain of getting the Deluxe version yet, you can always download the Free version of this game from ADOM homepage, and try it out as much you want. The base game is the same regardless, but There are bunch of nifty features that will not be in the free versions ever. But if you so desire, you can run the newest free version of this game on your Amiga or old MS-Dos computers. That's how old-school this game is.\n\n//Additions\n- Point based Character creation has been Added to the game, which allows more customization.\n- You can now also Choose your starting Starsign, unlike previously\n- Majority of Bugs Fixed (Basically, unless you applied to the beta, which you can do if you so desire, you shouldn't encounter any bugs)\n\n//Coming Features\n- Animations\n- Volcano (A new dungeon, that is completely different from other places currently in game)\n- More Quests\n- Even more Bugfixes", "timestamp_created": 1447706861, "timestamp_updated": 1480011406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19119369": {"recommendationid": "19119369", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979399256", "num_games_owned": 3472, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 9232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456129631}, "language": "english", "review": "This is, simply put, the greatest game ever made.

The depth of this game is unrivaled by anything. You will encounter mind boggling scenarios and unimaginable deaths. For instance, I was walking through a dungeon once and I heard a water trap go off. I came around a corner and I was blown to bits by fiery death. As I sat there wondering what in the hell just happened, I came to realize that a goblin had stepped on the water trap that I had heard go off and when he got hit with the water, a potion that he was carrying reacted with the water and exploded. Or how about the time I ate a kobold corpse that made me sick and then promptly got bit by a ghoul that paralyzed me and I choked to death on my own vomit? Yes, this kind of stuff actually happens. It's the kind of stuff that makes you rage quit the game and, oddly enough, it's what keeps you playing the same game going on 20 years.\n\nI will drink from a pool tonight in a toast for ADOM's arrival on Steam.

The explanation for this was polishing the game for the general steam audience rather than the more forgiving hardcore old fans of the game. Despite this, it is not really ready for a general audience despite there being easily enough time to prepare it.\n\n[strike]1. The game can crash: I experienced a crash within my first two hours of play. The game is permadeath but does autosave every 1000 turns. The problem is that in order to recover from a crash you have to know what you are doing and rename a certain file a certain way. The game is not programmed to realize it hasn't shut down cleanly so it can't help you.[/strike]seems fixed\n\n2. There is mouse control but it's not total, meaning you have to press keys sometimes. It's not easy to even predict when you'll have to press a key rather than being able to use the mouse.\n\n3. The default keys are really bad from a HCI point of view (human-computer interaction): For example to rest to regain hp etc. until something disturbs you is w5 or w. That's a two key sequence for something you will be doing all the time. [strike]Even worse is the autoexplore which is w?. That's a two key sequence with the second key requiring shift! This for something you will also be doing constantly. [/strike]auto-explore is now - (minus) (casting spells as shift z, (pick spell letter), direction is bad too although is being changed to non shifted z which is slightly better)\n\n4. It is possible to redefine the keys but unless you are an old player of adom or go looking on forums you wouldn't know how to. You have to go and get the config key file from where the game saves game data to (as in not the base game directory, e.g. for me it's C:\\Users\\<username>\\Documents\\ADOM\\adom_steam) edit it in a text editor (and you have to know how to) [strike]and then put it in the right directory.[/strike]\n\n5. There are certain features \"coming soon\". They include things like points-based character creation and being able to choose your star sign. Despite these things really not taking very long at all to program, they have been languishing on todo lists for ages. One of these at least was used by the greenlight campaign as an example of something that would be exclusive to the steam version and yet somehow didn't get programmed in the year and a half between being greenlit and steam release.

If you're a fan of rogue-likes, you've probably played ADOM already. However, this is the first of the classic rogue-likes to make its way into Steam and a wide new audience. People who are interested in rogue-like themes and the so called rogue-lite games might find a lot to like here.\n\nAs a rogue-like, ADOM is a turn-based RPG. This means that every time you take an action, all of the other characters in the game do so as well, including enemies. In a sense, it's not really turn-based as all the movement happens at once, meaning you never have to wait for the enemy's movement. Combat is a simple matter at ground level but gets more complex as the game progresses. In its most basic form, you are simply \"running\" into enemies. This causes you to attack them and they will attack back at you and so on. However, you can influence this combat in many ways. This includes switching your tactics to gain better to-hit chance and damage at the expense of defenses (can be used flexibly and in different ways depending on the situation), casting spells, drinking potions, zapping wands, reading scrolls, firing missiles, using skills and maneuvering around the dungeon to name a few. Trash mobs you can simply run into and destroy with ease, but whenever you encounter a new and unknown, potentially strong monster, you might want to slow down the pace and consider what gear you have to help you. And remember the number one rule of rogue-likes: always have an escape plan in mind!\n\nADOM is absolutely brutal. Rogue-lite games often mention how they are extremely difficult and will require multiple tries before you beat them. These games also tend to be relatively short, 1-2 hour experiences in various genres from fps to platformers. ADOM on the other hand is a purebred rogue-like through and through; a successful game is likely to take 15+ hours and the hundreds of failures you will suffer on the way will add even more hours on top of that. Now I happen to think this is a strength; there is immense amounts of replayability in the game due to a variety of races and classes you can play as, in addition to a huge amount of procedural generation when it comes to monsters you encounter, loot you find and dungeon layouts you will explore. And once you beat the game normally, guess what! There's several Ultra Endings to attempt as well! These endings are insanely hard to pull off, require EVEN more tries than the normal one and are virtually impossible without some outside information sources.\n\nADOM's strength in relation to other rogue-likes lies in its structured nature: Terinyo is always in the same place as well as the main dungeons of the game. There are quests that you will undertake in a logical order and once you learn your way around the early game, it is possible to form a strategy. This is absolutely key; where many rogue-likes hinge purely on RNG to get you going, ADOM actually has a very deep strategy layer to its gameplay. The other notable selling point in relation to other rogue-likes is the skill system; every race and class has a set of skills they start off with, and these skills can be improved as you advance in levels. This gives leveling a more meaningful feeling compared to some other rogue-likes where you simply gain more health and magic points.\n\nNow this review could go on forever, but hopefully I've given you some insight into whether or not ADOM is something you might be into. Personally, I love this game. I have beaten it three times the normal way and once I've achieved the Avatar of Order ending. I've played this game over the course of 15 years, two development cycles and who knows how many hours. It is truly something special.\n\nLastly, some meta-advice:\n\n-Do not play the game in softcore mode! Permadeath is an integral part of the rogue-like experience and you will hate ADOM if you don't have permadeath on. A character is very likely to die; you have to learn to deal with it. The entire premise of the game is that you roll hundreds of characters until finally one of them sticks and gets farther into the game than the others. If you keep struggling with a character who was never even meant to survive the experience will be miserable. Not to mention you will never have that feeling of utter disaster when your best character dies at the final level. Or on the way back after winning the game. And all of those losses will build up to the final success; when you finally, after all that heartbreak, beat the game and leave Drakalor Chain, you look back at the time you've spent and go: \"Fuck yes, I actually did it. I beat this son of a bitch of a game. Hell yes.\"\n\n-Don't be afraid to look up stuff on the wiki: ADOM is a massive game and very cryptic in some areas. However, I would suggest avoiding making a habit out of this. Explore the game freely; you're going to die so many times anyway so what's the point of completely spoiling yourself? But once you get a promising character rolling, you might want to check up on the effects of eating this specific monster's corpse, or how dangerous exactly that Gorgon is ;)\n\n-Give the ASCII version a try! The tilesets are very nicely done and the bare-bones ASCII style might seem clunky and unintuitive at first. But you'd be surprised at the advantages it has. For example, you will easily identify new enemies: a small \"g\" is always going to be a goblin-like small humanoid, an uppercase \"D\" is always going to be a dragon or dragon-like huge lizard like drake and so on. Very clear and handy compared to the tilesets imo.

Truth be told, of all games I have played on my PC in the last 15 years, ADOM has surely been the one I keep returning to most often. And if there's anything that hasn't changed since the first time is that, whenever I do start up a new character, I can hardly keep myself off the game until the character dies... or until I win. Today the game is officially released on Steam, and the least I can do to repay ADOM and its team for hundreds upon hundreds of hours of fun is to review it.\n\nSo, what is ADOM about? It's a fantasy-themed roguelike RPG where you create a character of your liking, choosing from a roster of several races and professions, and embark upon a journey to find out what is it that's plaguing a remote mountain chain. Most of the elements are pretty easy to grasp now that we have mouse control, graphics, and even some rudimentary animation, but should you spend some more time with the game, you'll certainly realize the complexity and level of detail that manifest themselves in almost every aspect of the game (well, except the dialogues\u2014this isn't Planescape: Torment for sure) and this tends to hook everyone who spends more than a couple hours with it. It's not often that you play something for years and keep learning something new and relearning old things with every playthrough. Most of the in-game situations have lots of different possible solutions, which is something that large expensive AAA-titles have all but forgone these days. This game certainly rewards intelligent, thoughtful play\u2014which in no way dimishes its ability to pump adrenaline in certain situations.\n\nAs far as roguelikes go, ADOM is definitely more on the traditional RPG side: the world isn't as sandbox-ish as something like Dwarf Fortress, there are a lot of fixed elements and reasonably fleshed-out quests; a typical ascension (the roguelike lingo for completing the ultimate quest and leaving the game) takes from a full day if you're just rushing everything to something closer to a week\u2014even for experienced players. Virtually all the development decisions with regards to its content are also made by the same person, Thomas Biskup\u2014the ageless director and Creator of ADOM. Obviously, there are some disadvantages to this approach, which served to be the main reason the game has at one point spent a decade in neglect, but this man's creativity and burning passion for hardcore RPGs, the fantasy, and the adventure, is what's taken it here\u2014after more than 20 years since its inception. So when Thomas started a crowdsourcing campaign in 2012 to make massive updates to ADOM, I was among the people who contributed without a second thought. Getting ADOM here on Steam, which is almost unthinkable for a genre so niche and seemingly impenetrable, is a huge success. No-one thought this would be possible before the campaign ended. All of the funds that were raised were put to good use, and the backers recognize the main reason behind it: to give the development a strong push, not to make money out of a free product (more on this below).\n\nIf you've never played roguelikes, or have no experience with turn-based RPGs in particular, ADOM in its current form is definitely a good place to start. It's definitely a slow burner, and it might seem a little unforgiving at first, but don't discard it if your character keeps getting killed in the first 10 minutes. Try different approaches to the same problem, play to your character's strengths, take the easy ways and pay attention to many generous cues\u2014all of this will be rewarded. At some point you might even decide to turn the graphical interface off and continue playing with good old ASCII\u2014you'd be surprised how immersive can gameplay get if you let your imagination paint the picture. It works just like a good book. Although the monster designs are definitely sweet, and they make the game seem more like a Spiderweb Software RPGs\u2014another dear favorites of mine.\n\nThose of you who have already tried ADOM many years ago and are wondering what is different about it these days are in luck: virtually every aspect of the game has seen improvements\u2014often drastic ones! Difficulty curve is a lot less spiky now, most of the infamous exploits are fixed or toned down to sane levels, and there's quite a bit of new content to dabble in if you feel like it (none is shoved down your throat, mind\u2014TB recognizes the game is long as is)\u2014both semi-fixed and completely random. Even if you keep playing without graphics, I encourage you to leave the in-game music on: it fits the game quite well and definitely enhances the roguelike experience.\n\nSo, to sum up, if you enjoy some or most of:\n[list][*] large, detailed, fantasy-themed worlds;\n[*] exploring dangerous, non-linear series of dungeons, which you can enter methodically or try diving in early for their treasure and the adrenaline rush that comes with it;\n[*] RPGs with heavily customizable characters and elaborate combat mechanics;\n[*] games that aren't afraid to challenge you and give choices with impactful, permanent consequences;\n[*] games that are immersive, detailed, and treat you like an intellectually capable person once you let go of the tutorial;\n[*] that immense feeling of reward when you have finally beat the game for the first time;\n[*] achievements that are, for the most part, [i]actual and commendable achievements[/i];[/list]\n...ADOM just might be your top pick. It has its problems, but they're relatively minor and ultimately dwarfed by the good stuff.\n\nLet me conclude by saying this. Those of us who have been playing ADOM for years upon years don't do it because of nostalgia\u2014we never did. [b]It's because ADOM excels at what it has set out to do, and is constantly getting better at it[/b]. How many games you know have seen their authors grow into successful businessmen and yet [i]still[/i] keep working hard upon improving and polishing a piece of creative effort they have started back in their college years? This game is an honest-to-god result of so much love, thought, and craft, that you'd be hard-pressed to find anything that compares. We play ADOM because we feel this. We play it because it's [b]still genuinely fun[/b]. And by the way: if you don't want the fancy and convenient stuff in the Steam version of the game, the classic, fully-hardcore version of ADOM with the same fully up-to-date quests, mechanics, and content has been, and will always remain, [i]distributed for free[/i] on the [url=http://www.adom.de/]original site[/url]. This speaks of honesty and love more than anything else I could think of. Support it while you can!\n\nSo, would I recommend ADOM? Well now, why [i]wouldn't[/i] I. Play it. Play the hell out of it!

I've since spent hundreds of hours exploring the mysterious Drakalor Chain. ADOM is one of my all-time favourite games, and certainly the only game originally released in the 90's that I don't play for nostalgia - but because it is still fresh.\n\nADOM is an RPG in the true sense of the word: it does not impose restrictions on you. The problem I have with most RPGs these days is how they limit the player's actions. The choice between good and evil is often in fact the choice between the good and evil dialogue option. ADOM is different in that you can actually do whatever you want, be anyone you want to be. And doing whatever you want actually means something in ADOM, since the game has a ridiculously large amount of content. Really, it does.\n\n- Gameplay -\n\nIn ADOM, first you'll create your character. Your character will be given a starsign that will have some effect on him/her. After that you'll choose your race, profession, talents etc. from a ton of options. These choises will guide you as you start your journey, but won't limit you as (or if) you progress.\n\nAs the game begins, you enter Drakalor Chain, a troubled valley with many mysteries to explore. From then on it's all up to you. Go to the nearest village and interact with the townsfolk or find your own path. Battle fierce beasts, learn incredible spells, rob stores, fight for money, make friends, embark on quests, search for artifacts, brew deadly poisons, control minds, barter items, cook food, worship your gods, play instruments, raise the dead, clean your ears...\n\nAnd of course you'll die. You'll be drowned, burnt and crushed to death. You'll die of hunger and sickness and bloodloss. You'll accidentally kill yourself conducting dangerous magical experiments. You'll die as you are sacrificed to strange and terrible gods. You'll die and return. And maybe, just maybe you'll one day defeat the powers that plague Drakalor Chain. I never did, yet, but I'll keep on trying.\n\nSee you in the Caverns of Chaos!", "timestamp_created": 1447703555, "timestamp_updated": 1447703555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19118547": {"recommendationid": "19118547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056296284", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 931, "last_played": 1516006173}, "language": "english", "review": "Adom is fun.

You're fragile, healing potions are few and far between, and there are dozens of monsters between you and your goal: therefore you have to weave a complicated path through killing everything before it can strike, dodging or blocking those strikes, or just plain getting away from your enemies for a few turns.\n\nCard Quest is fast, thrilling, and quickly stealing my evenings since I bought it. It is a card game, but there are no individual cards to hunt down, it wouldn't work in multiplayer, and it's more like the devs replaced typical turn-based rpg combat with cards. Instead of hitting attack, you choose an attack card from your hand. To dodge, use a dodge card when the enemy attacks. There are cards for drawing more cards, for restoring your limited resources, etc.\n\nOkay. The skinny: you pick a class, wizard, fighter, rogue, ranger. Every class has different sets of cards that you mix n' match to build your deck. You can add equippable armors or amulets in your slots that augment different decks. Then you pick your campaign - there are three - and go right into combat. Every campaign is lavish, with short written segments to set the stage, with tons of varied enemies with darn good art, and bosses at the end of every gauntlet. Once you beat a specific segment's boss, you can choose where you go next, unlocking more story and fighting a different set of monsters. Rinse, repeat until you hit the final areas - I can't comment on them, because I'm still back in the catacombs or trying to kill a king.\n\nWhich is to say: this game is tough! Once you start getting hit, unless you can turn the tables and wipe out your enemies, you're going to die. A lot. Which is fine, the game is fun!\n\nPlay the tutorials first. They're not just good at teaching you the flow of the game, they're good puzzles in their own right and they give you handy equipment you can bring into the main campaigns. I particularly liked the rogue one, where you have to beat up an entire thief gang before they'd let you join.\n\nTo sum up: I love this game. I love playing as a wizard who surrounds themselves with electricity that roasts the undead as they swarm, who creates intricate illusions so enemies keep whiffing, who calls down the heavens to zap a towering mountain of corpses. I love how lovingly crafted this game is, with details built into every monster and encounter.\n\nThis game is incredible, and I highly, highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1515031747, "timestamp_updated": 1515031747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528186", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39014343": {"recommendationid": "39014343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120130945", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 155, "last_played": 1515364150}, "language": "english", "review": "Smart and challenging card game.

Those choices are set unlocks, eg \"Unlock the xtreme four swords and belt pouches fighting style for Fighter by beating the forest, level 2-B\".\n\nYour choice in where to go is branching, so you want to ideally beat everywhere as everything to unlock all your options.\n\nWhat do you do with those options? Each character class has three slots for card packs, which contain a preset group of cards per pack. Those cards build and consume various resources, and so you want to have a fair balance of build and consume for things. You also have three equipment slots that augment certain playstyles by drawing, generating, or damaging.\n\nThe art is not \"great\", but very much has the \"oldschool RPG\" charm. I enjoy the art here more than I'd enjoy something generic and bland. \n\nThe gameplay uses a few relatively simple basic mechanics for the monsters you encounter, with a good variety of tools for dealing with them, and you're made to consider what to do. It's not super duper deep, but it's also quite beyond the bland fare of clickers and very basic RPGs. You're at the mercy to some extent of RNG, but card draw and cycling is common enough that having the right type of deck matters a lot more in the later areas, and earlier areas are more a case of learning to use what you have.", "timestamp_created": 1510241723, "timestamp_updated": 1510241723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640996", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36381278": {"recommendationid": "36381278", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963664525", "num_games_owned": 755, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 2584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 175, "last_played": 1515959877}, "language": "english", "review": "Half RPG, half card-puzzle-game.

Coupled with the requirement of going through all the previous fights after every new death, it just became a chore to do the fights I could win with my eyes closed just so that I could get to the one I was struggling with.\n\nNow a lot of things ghave changed - the encounters are still mostly scripted, but there is much more variation within them, you can finally choose how to level up your character, and there's a lot more items and subclasses to give the game some much-needed variation. You don't feel like guessing the designer's intended path anymore - instead you're solving emergent issues on the fly. And you don't have to do the early fights for hundred times anymore (although the requirements for it  are still a bit too restrictive, in my mind).\n\nSo yes, Card Quest is now making full use of its combat system, which relies on fighting-game like combos and careful management of very limited resources. There's no CCG element (although you can unlock decks, which are basically subclasses), so what you see when you start a stage is more or less what you will have to get by. There's never a point where you feel invincible, as it's often enough to overstretch yourself for one turn to receive a kicking, from which it'll be difficult (but not impossible) to get back on your feet.

I enjoyed the game, but not quite for the reasons I expected.\n\nWhen I bought this game, I expected it to be something of a 'deck-building' game, when it's really more of a resource-management game. That is to say I expected to theorycraft some overpowered decks by finding hidden synergies between card packs, but the way the game is designed causes most card packs to only work with a few others, and it's fairly obvious which ones go together and which ones don't. \nIn mechanics: You have three slots that can hold a card pack, and put together they create the deck you draw from. Most of the card packs will also use or generate a secondary resource, so if you try to combine packs that generate fire and use arcana (for example), you won't be able to attack or defend yourself for very long. Now there's usually at least two to three card packs per slot that use or generate this secondary resource, but that also means there are very few combinations that work together and it's pretty easy to see which ones will drain resources faster than they can be replenished. \nAlso on the negative, you unlock these sets one piece at a time, so the early part of the game is extremely difficult and grindy until you've unlocked enough packs or equipment to put together a new playstyle.\nAnd finally, the endgame is pretty boring because there are a few easy-to-find deck combinations that are overpowered and will let you destroy pretty much anything before it can fight back, just because you end up generating more resources and cycling more cards than you use.\n\nSo why do I recommend it? Well, I could say that many card packs have special effects that aren't explained until you start using them, and they often force you to play the class differently. I could also say that the game does include a large enough variety of enemy mechanics that you'll need to keep a strategy in mind even by the end of the game. But really, I'm not sure. Maybe I just enjoy the rhythm inherent to a late-game character when I know which cards to chain to keep my resources strong. I'm hesitant to recommend Card Quest since I have more complaints about the game design than praise for it, but I had fun and I don't regret buying it at all, and that's the bottom line I'll judge a game by.

Ex- You can make a Berserker / Longsword / Spiked Shield combo for your Warrior which would create a deck for you on Berserker Style defensive moves, Longsword attacks and combos, and Shield Blocks that harm the enemy.\n\nAfter you set your character you go out into the dungeons which are a series of fights leading to a boss battle. Kill the boss and unlock a new item for your character class! There are 3 dungeons each with 20ish floors total so there is a ton of content to fight through as it's a pretty different experience with each of the 4 classes.

I find it a welcome change of pace because while I can appreciate the hardcore fine-tuning of your deck with specific cards, sometimes you just want to focus on the tactical aspect of the battles.\n\nYou'd think this would make this game a walk in the park, but nothing could be further from the truth. The tutorial will kick your teeth in as you learn the basic synergies and possible combos you can string, and then the main game will shower you with more options, more challenges and more headscratchers.\n\nThe best aspect of the game is that it never feels as if the game simply decided to screw you over. When you lose, you can always pinpoint your defeat to a mistaken discard, stamina overuse, poor target selection, lack of foresight, etc. There's always a way, and that way is never dependent on buying a legendary card pack with your hard-earned money.\n\nIf you're casual about card-collecting, but you love a good challenge (and what a challenge it is!), then look no further.", "timestamp_created": 1499539886, "timestamp_updated": 1499539886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531692", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33239875": {"recommendationid": "33239875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018687510", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501012504}, "language": "english", "review": "Addictive!

if FTL and a modern digital card game had a baby with most of the fun parts of both and none of the flaws.\n\nYou build your run from the start out of pieces of equipment, each of these pieces of equipment come with cards that make up your deck.  For example, a sword comes with 3 sword hacks and 1 sword stab.  This is how you build your deck.  Unlike any other roguelike i've played, there are very little upgrades you can get within the middle of a run.  In fact, there isn't really any.  Every single stage comes with a piece of equipment or upgrade to a piece of equipment, but these carry over run to run and mostly serve to give you more options.  You don't slowly build up a run as you play it, you build your run from the start and see how far you can get.\n\nIt's an extremely well designed game with tons of replay value.  At the time of writing this, I've played about 20 hours.  I've just about got the warrior to the maximum level, and I only very recently beat the final stages of both campaigns.  I haven't even touched the other two classes outside of the tutorials.  I've enjoyed every hour, though some of the deaths made me upset, that's expected in a game like this.\n\nEvery single time I died, I always felt like it was my fault and that I could have done better, because the game gives you plenty of options to help compensate for bad luck or mistakes.  After I learnt how to play, I felt like the only way for me to die was to make several mistakes in a row, or to make a mistake after getting unlucky.  I never got a string of bad luck that killed me on it's own.  None that I can remember, anyway.\n\nSo far, I absolutely love this game.  I have to be honest and admit that its probably not for everyone, it's very slow paced, repetitive, and runs where you don't unlock anything new can feel like a complete waste of time even if you earnt XP.  The game would be less repetitive and more interesting if you could change equipment freely between stages, even if it doesn't make sense within the story.  Packing throwing axes for levels that I know are going to be full of contact damage jerkasses would save me loads of time, and being able to adapt my strategy stage to stage would probably lead to me trying lots of new loadouts instead of sticking to what I know works well.  It would make the game slightly easier, but it would make the game easier in a way that makes it more interesting, and this game is nowhere close to being too easy.\n\nTo sum it up concisely:\n\n+ Great design, card games can be hard to design properly, especially if they're non-conventional, but card quest doesn't really have any design flaws, every mechanic works, every loadout can work, there are mechanics that allow you to make up for bad luck and the game is still extremely punishing in spite of that.  It's perfectly fair, extremely unique, and very interesting.  I can't imagine any ways it could be designed any better.\n\n+ Extremely replayable.  Whether you are leveling up, going for different stages to see new enemies and unlock new equipment, or just trying out loadouts you haven't considered before, card quest definitely seems to be made for replayability.\n\n+ Cheap and Deep.  It's 8 bucks homie.  Assuming I play the other two classes just as long as I've played the warrior, and the enchanted forest gets added and is just as deep as the other two campaigns, I will play card quest for 90 hours before I unlock everything.  And that's assuming that there won't be any more content released for the existing campaigns, or new classes for that matter.  This game is already extremely deep, and it has the potential to get exponentially deeper.  I'll probably still play it after I unlock everything, too.\n\n+- Extremely difficult.  You're probably gonna want to pull your hair out.  This game starts off decently challenging, but every single stage is a nasty difficulty spike.  Every single one.  On the other hand, if this game wasn't hard, it would be boring.   Winning feels rewarding and the slow paced nature of the game isn't as bad because if you're anything like me, you're going to spend most of your time planning anyway.\n\n- Hard to start playing.  When you first start off, you have deliberately underpowered equipment, and none of the get out of jail free cards like armors, trinkets, and bag items.  This is in addition to being new to the game, which I'd say has a high learning curve.  Your first few hours are going to be the hours you hate the most.  In order to upgrade your starting equipment to the same power level as most equipment, you have to be able to beat the first two stages.\n\n- Slow paced.  Getting to the end of the game requires going through 6 stages, each of those stages have 8 (I think) levels in them.  Each one of those levels, depending on the difficulty, could last anywhere from 30 seconds to 30 minutes.  That's not an exaggeration, rounds with lots of undead guards or contact damage enemies tend to take that long for me.  It can feel like a slog sometimes.  And if at any point you screw up enough to die, you start either all the way back at the beginning, or halfway through the game if you've done every single 3rd stage with that character.  It can feel like an absolute slog sometimes, and obviously the further through the game you are, the longer each level will take.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if you think this game looks cool, and the things I've said negatively about it don't bother you, you will probably love it.", "timestamp_created": 1489880915, "timestamp_updated": 1489880982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30482697": {"recommendationid": "30482697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045401832", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506255634}, "language": "english", "review": "Addicting and lots of replay value.

Cards can be used or purchased using energy and (sometimes) a tactic stat (rage, tactics, faith, etc).  CQ is turn based with you attacking first in most situations before the enemy launches their attack on you.  Bosses are encountered at the end of every area.

This means that rather than cherry-picking the best cards in the game, you get interesting tradeoffs - do I want to bring this shield that consistently blocks big-damage attacks, or this smaller shield that blocks for less but adds a dodge and a shield bash to my options? Adding to the decision making is a \"Chain\" system where certain cards gain additional effects if they're played one after another- you might have a sword swing deal additional damage, a spell have its energy cost reduced, or a quick dodge draw new cards to replenish your hand - and Chainbreakers that have dramatic effects, but disrupt the flow of your chain.\n\nLike FTL, this game starts at high difficulty and steadily ramps it up as you progress. You start with a basic, mostly serviceable deck for each of the game's three classes, but it won't get you far beyond the first chapter. As you complete chapters and level up, you very gradually unlock the additional equipment and styles that will let you really start making decisions about your build, but it should be noted that the most frustrating fights will be right at the beginning, when half your inventory is empty and bosses seem like impenetrable walls of hitpoints. This isn't helped by the fact that there's a few mechanics the game currently doesn't explain very well (tip: discarding cards you don't need right now is almost always a good idea before you play anything that draws new ones, and the ability to mulligan your starting hand at the cost of energy is crucial for the default Warrior deck, who has energy to burn but won't last long if his opening hand doesn't have the right cards). However, this would be pretty easy to improve as Early Access rolls on.\n\nPresentation-wise, it doesn't re-invent the wheel, but it doesn't need to. The art is 16-bit-style pixel, but clear and well-crafted. The sounds are stock assets, and the music is provided by Kevin MacLeod. I find none of these things detrimental to the game- it has a fun, hobby-project atmosphere and feels like a fully developed aesthetic choice rather than a slapdash use of existing assets. However, if you're the type of person who looks down your nose at pixel art as a category, or feels smug when a sound effect is reused from elsewhere, that will probably get in the way of your ability to enjoy this game.\n\nRegarding its Early Access state, it already feels very fully formed and ready to strut its stuff. There's very little in the way of \"missing features\"- the main screen has two complete campaigns with a third \"not available in this version\", but the two campaigns already in there are meaty enough that this feels less like \"this game is light on content\" and more like \"wow, they're going to add a whole 50% extra game to this game before it even launches\". Other than that and a little UI polish and bugfixes, this game is pretty much good to go.\n\nAll in all, I quite recommend Card Quest. You may recognize the other games that make up its DNA, but it blends them in a way that's very much a fresh and unique experience, and if you like what it's offering, it has a lot of it to offer.", "timestamp_created": 1486322708, "timestamp_updated": 1486322708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29705907": {"recommendationid": "29705907", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994705798", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 96, "last_played": 1516361645}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun.

One boss has a special ability called Damage on Contact: 1, meaning I take 1 damage every time I hit him with a melee ability.\n\nI happen to have no Ranged cards in my deck.  This is something I overlooked and really didn't realize until getting to that boss.  he simply has too much HP for me to chip through without taking enough damage from Contact damage to kill me, or severely leave me at a HP defecit for the next area.  \n\nThis problem basically means that, while the game has branches for each area (Go Here or There, your choice), some of these branches are just not feasible for me to go to with certain decks, and it kind of defeats the point.  \n\nThe game also has \"rogue-like- features, meaning if you happen to die, you have to start the entire run over from scratch.  This feature does not fit this game, at all.  A lot of bosses, depending on what you're using, almost REQUIRE that you hit a certain rotation of cards to successfully defeat.  If you are unable to accomplish significant progress within your first turn by cycling enough cards to either kill all the Adds the boss has, or just outright kill the boss, you're basically in deep shit. Bosses typically have more than one attack, meaning more resources (Stamina) must be spent ot play Defensive cards, which leaves you at a defecit when you recover Stamina each round.  So, if the boss is attacking you (usually) twice, and you didn't kill ALL those Adds and left 1 or 2, that's 3 cards you have to play and use Stamina for.  Some bosses even have a passive, and unavoidable effect, where they'll deal damage AND drain Stamina from you every turn.  The only way to counter this is to make them Unaware, which means you can't attack them, because that will remove it.  You can't Stun them because all bosses are Stun immune.\n\nBecause of this rotation requirment, this means if you play the game as intended, you're easily looking at SEVERAL re-runs of a boss until the RNG fits into place to give you the run of cards you need to get a good chunk of progress through a boss through your first turn.\n\nAs of right now, you can hit Escape and Return to menu, which will let you restart the Encounter.  I don't exactly consider this cheating, as I cannot progress until I beat the boss anyways, it's more or less saving me several hours of having to repeat the same content for no apparent reason.  In other \"rogues\", you generally learn something each time you die and are better armed for whats ahead of you the next time.  In Card Quest, you maybe learn something the first time a boss kills you, but beyond that, it's really just trial and error until you hit a good string of cards that let you do what you need to do.\n\nThe game would be in a much better state if the following were implemented:\n\nLetting players change their classe's equipment after every stage.  With this feature, I can actually choose where I want to go whenever I want to, instead of letting my deck dictate that.  If I want to go to the Sewers where contact damage is a thing, I think swap out some equipment to arm me with Ranged damage.  If this area has a lot of enemies that spawn Adds, I can swap equpiment to give me some AoE stun options, and so on.  As of now, once you pick your starting equipment, you're locked into it the entire run, so you better hope you make no mistakes as to where you want to go.\n\nSecondly, getting rid of the Rogue elements.  There are no other \"rogue elements\" in the game aside from \"start over\", so this addition is just benign and seemingly only for the ability to add the tag to their game.  The game is already a massive grind as it is, as the XP rewards for enemies are atrocious, adding more of it isn't helping anyone.", "timestamp_created": 1485901230, "timestamp_updated": 1486438825, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.693635", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29595606": {"recommendationid": "29595606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091638264", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486643296}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoy games in the card RPG genre, this would be a wonderful addition to your library, but make sure you keep it under the \"You WILL die\" section of your library, with Super Meat Boy and Dark Souls.", "timestamp_created": 1485822153, "timestamp_updated": 1485822526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29575991": {"recommendationid": "29575991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034706201", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485733844}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Something of an obsession...Card Quest is a stellar entry into a genre that was starting to seem like it might have no more stellar entries left, deserving of both your time and your money.\"\nFull review for HeyPoorPlayer here: http://www.heypoorplayer.com/2017/01/29/card-quest-review/", "timestamp_created": 1485734742, "timestamp_updated": 1485734742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29550689": {"recommendationid": "29550689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015531498", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 2709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503777228}, "language": "english", "review": "Fights are like solving puzzles \nVery challanging and rewarding feeling\nTheres a lot of content already if you play all 3 classes and want all unlocks", "timestamp_created": 1485639226, "timestamp_updated": 1485639226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562984", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29521756": {"recommendationid": "29521756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083824217", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 129, "playtime_forever": 1757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486336829}, "language": "french", "review": "3 compagnons unis par les liens du sang, de la magie et de la discr\u00e9tion ; ils voguent aux abords du fleuve du mal sans pr\u00e9tention.\n\nUn royaume envahi et \u00e0 la merci du d\u00e9mon, une ode \u00e0 la destruction.

It is a tactical card game where you have selection of different equipment which gives you different active effects as well as builds.\n\nThe biggest flaw is the level up system giving vertical power progression. It is essentially impossible to beat the entire dungeon on your first playthrough as the passive bonuses are not there. Instead you need to level up a few times to give the bonuses. I wish the bonuses were unlocked by beating a level and the equipment (which for the most part is horizonal power with the exception of getting a new slot used) was earned over time.\n\nHowever I do find the game really fun.\n\nThe Rogue is by far the easiest class to understand early on because it relies on energy as its only resource while the other classes have more resources.\n\nYou will need to level to beat some of the dungeons. The first floor is beatable at level 1 or 2, and then it seems like around 3, 5, 7, 9 for the remaining tiers. These are ballpark levels and it should not take that much more grinding but just expect that the vertical progression holding back your advancement a bit.\n\nThere are absolutely equipment that is better at going down some paths. You will quickly realize that some builds are great early on but may need to be changed out to deal with certain floors. This is most obvious with things that only affect melee range once ranged monsters start appearing.\n\nThere is several mechanics in the game that need to be figured out.

Beat that first dungeon by force of repitition if luck is not on your side and you shall not be disappointed for the next to come.  Note that the beating the game is  not based on luck, you'll have to collect all the items from each dungeon and decks to be rightly set for the last boss, I don't know how hard is the last boss but the system i just described on how to beat him is obvious.\nThanksfully there's no loading time or anything preventing you from completing your runs very fast, jumping from one encounter to the other in seconds if you already know what to do.\n\nCard quest has a huge replayability with its diverse classes to play from the start. Each have they own different sets of deck and equipments and you get more access to these as you progress in game.\n\nFor that price it's a gem, I know I am going to spend a lot more hours on this games than a lot of $40 AAA games.

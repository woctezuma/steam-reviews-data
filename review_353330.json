Its focal point, our single eyed Sachi, makes for a very cute VN, and her whole character was adorable. Even with a single large eye she was able to melt my heart. However, the weak writing made for a rocky read.\n\nThe art in this game is a little hit or miss, with the best sprites and CG going to Sachi (of course). The sprites for other characters felt lackluster or had proportional errors which made them look a little strange or stiff. The one thing I think the art does well is capture the tone of the surroundings, which is not something VNs focus on. The sprites come off as dark and a little dull looking, using lots of grey tones, but as the story's mood shifts these sprites begin to warm up with brighter colours to complement feelings such as happiness. It's a really nice touch, and blended the art style together with the backgrounds and emotions the story was trying to convey. Furthermore, this VN has really nice background music, and sometimes it was pleasant to just let it loop. I definitely think this is one of the VN's strongest traits, as the tracks could shift between scenes but never felt boring to listen to.\n\nConcerning the writing, the game was free of spelling or grammar errors, and the characters were written with mostly distinct voices, which become apparent later on in the game as there are some POV changes. However, despite all the good things I've said so far, this game has weaker writing. This is explained in the author's afterword as due to the fact the game was rushed, and I think it shows in the game. Characters don't get fleshed beyond what we're presented with except for Sachi, and a lot of the development between Sachi and Mamoru kind of just happens, rather than a good steady progression of their relationship. Of course, with a game focusing on our one eyed heroine, Sachi would get the most development, but even then it is not done in a natural or satisfactory way, and her arc (which coincides with the antagonist's arc) ends in a rather anticlimactic tone. The good things I can say concerning the writing were the changes in POV, giving us insight to several characters, and tidbits of characters doing things that indicate depth to them (but as stated earlier, it's never expanded upon).\n\nWhat drew me to this game initially was the heroine, but aside from a few mentions of her eye it doesn't really come up much and doesn't seem like much of an impediment to her. I would have thought she would have been tormented and hated the single eye she had, but she doesn't really get bullied over that so why is her eye not a stronger trait in the story? I feel like this was a critical piece of writing that should have been included into the plot.\n\nEvery way I look, I just see a lot of missed potential. Sachi is great as a character, but if the writing had been stronger and the characters had more depth, this game could have been fantastic. I want to love this game, I really, [i]really[/i] do because Sachi is absolutely precious, but I cannot recommend this game, especially for the high price it's asking for. The game, aside from being a short play at around 3 hours, offers nothing beyond mediocre writing and characterization, which is unfortunate. I would like to see the dev go back and polish this game or add something new, because I think an overhaul of this game could make it well worth the $10 price.

\n\nThis is my first time reading a kinetic novel! (As opposed to otome.) Also, my first time as a male character wooing a girl. And you know what? It was wonderful!\n\n[h1]The Wonderful[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]The one-eyed girl, Sachi, is adorable!  So many cute moments!  There's a scene[spoiler]while she's being fed,[/spoiler] when she blushes and scrunches up her eye, that made my tummy do little flip-flops!  It makes you want to playfully tease her a bit more just to get those adorable reactions.  Her learning how to smile and trust is absolutely heart warming. \n    [*]Though she does have social problems, it's not so much based on her appearance.  Even her bully[spoiler]just despises aspects of her personality.[/spoiler]She has problems even a two-eyed girl might have, which makes it relatable.\n    [*]The art is lovely. I'd call it quirky.  Refreshing to look at.\n    [*]All characters have fleshed-out personalities. (I want to know MC's friends!)\n    [*]It's not a heavy story--more like a fairy tale.  Though I admit, first seeing her and her wounds/bandages is alarming.  You can see those for yourself on the store page before you buy.\n    [*]The English is flawless.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Not so Wonderful[/h1]\n[list]\n     [*]Short!  Finished in 3.5 hours.  As cute as it is, there's no way I'd wanna pay $9.99 for this--it's just too short.  I got it for $2.49 at 75% off which was a steal!  I wouldn't pay more than 5 bucks for it.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]...And the Weird[/h1]\n[list]\n     [*](mild spoiler)[spoiler]There's a plot device where the MC touches her wounds and scars to become more physically intimate.  It kinda reads like a sexual encounter...without the sex.  I felt like I was watching somebody's kink.  Not horrible--just odd.[/spoiler]\n     [*]There's an author's section where the creator apologizes for the shortness and quality.  That's the whole topic.  Apparently, she was rushed to meet a deadline to paticipate in some project. (Maybe a convention?)  It's a bit bizarre to include an author's not-so-short apology for the game you just purchased.  \n[/list]\n\n[h1]The Verdict[/h1]\n     I can't recommend this visual novel enough.  If you like cute, sweet, and sentimental--without breaking your heart--this is the game for you.

Anyone who likes monster girls/creepy cute atheistic and slice of life romance, would enjoy. \n\nThe VN is pretty basic; you can\u2019t chose responses and there is only one ending. Regardless the VN is nicely done and was a decent read.  After you beat the game, extras will be unlocked. Some will be basic story, with the characters interacting after the ending.

The story was cute, if a bit short, and it was generally entertaining, but for it's regular price of $10...it's definately not worth your money. There are at least half a dozen VN's on Steam that I could recommend for the same price or less with better art, better story, longer play time, etc. \n\nI think it's kind of sad that this game turned out the way it did, because I really do think that it had potential, but even the author admits that the game was rushed and was lacking in several departments. Had the art been cleaned up a bit, included some different routes, and just been given some more depth to the story, this could have been a great game, but as it stands, it's just an interesting and unique concept that didn't move far beyond that.\n\nUnless you're super into monster girl stories, like the anime meets Tim Burton art style, or you have an injured girl/scars fetish (The author's words, not mine), then you might enjoy Love at First Sight, everyone else should just move along. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1505166781, "timestamp_updated": 1505166781, "voted_up": false,

There are nothing that you need to do, no choices you need to make, all you have is a story to read. This is not a game, but a short visual novel for you to waste a little time on.\n\n[b]Is it a good story?[/b] Yes, if you wish to see a short, sweet story of \"something popped out of a fairytale\" then i say go for it. The story give me a vibe of [url=https://www.katawa-shoujo.com/]Katawa Shoujo[/url] as well (for obvious reasons).\n\n[b]How would i describe my experience reading this?[/b] The story is nowhere near perfect, that much is certain. Certain parts feel rushed and you can see the VN potential of being something greater had it the time to be polished. The author explained this issue in the VN itself, but here the short version:\n[spoiler]This is the author first attempt at making something in a game/VN format. The author is a Japanese living in America, and their English is not great. They only have about two months to work on this project before barely turn in before the deadline for Comitia, not to mention being mostly a one person project (they only had help with the soundtrack). Due to time constraint, the VN's full potential of being a full-fledged \"game\" was gone. This finished product only feature one path where the main character woo our cyclops. Should you search up the author and his artworks, there are pieces that indicate the VN to having multiple pathways with multiple \"unique\" girls to interact and potentially romanced. Sadly, all of these features are scrapped, and the author was not happy with the result.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Should you buy it?[/b] Admittedly, the game is not worth the $10 price tag only because the missed potential that it could be.

I would not recommend this to a first time VN reader.\n\nLove at First Sight is a bit of a tricky visual novel to review. Let's start with the good and neutral parts.\n\nThe artwork is its main selling point. While it could be considered amateurish, it has a lot of charm and I like it a lot. The backgrounds, CGs, and character sprites all have a similar quality to them that make them pleasing to the eye. The soundtrack is, at best, adequate. The story is told in multiple short \"Acts\" that have a small animation utilizing a CG or scene from the previous \"Act\". There are no choices to make throughout the story.\n\nLove at First Sight's plot is very cute and heartwarming, and has a lovely message and overall theme. It was an enjoyable read despite its somewhat strange subject matter, which is the primary reason I don't consider this a good pick for new visual novel readers. The characters were also a joy to read about even if they didn't have a lot of depth.\n\nBut..and this is an enormous but...Love at First Sight just isn't worth the price, whether it's the full one ($11 CAD) or on sale.\n\nThe primary reason for this is that the story just isn't very memorable. Sure, it's sugary sweet and more slice of life than anything, but the only thing you'll really remember about this story is that the heroine is a cyclops. Other than that, it is quite similar to other tales of its ilk, and I could predict the \"twists\" that came with it.\n\nIn addition, I read the novel in just about 2 hours, which feels too short for the price, especially full price, and [i]especially[/i] when more memorable visual novels are available for [i]free[/i] (see CUPID).\n\nSo, despite the fact that I honestly consider this novel to be \"good\", I really can't justify the price, and can't justify a \"recommendation\". Of course, feel free to snatch it up and read it when it's on sale, but don't go buying it at full price. You'll likely feel disappointed.\n\nNow I feel bad for marking this \"not recommended\".

A puddle of chocolate, with a side order of touching angst; the heroine is for better or worst a most troubled and sympathetic woobie, which is the main draw of the game. If you want to vicariously rescue a tragic and unhappy one-eyed schoolgirl step right up.\n\nWhen I said simple and short, I really meant that. The game has the simplest backstory, though side characters are decent, and I've heard some praise the hero for being active; perhaps that's why the game ends so quickly. Too quickly, and far too suddenly; any good ending should look forward somewhat into its characters' futures, which this game does not do.

Only a couple of months ago he had to transfer to a new school, but he has already found good friends in Tomoyori and Akemi. However, he meets a strange girl a year below him, named Sachi, in a hallway. She is strange in that she is a cyclops; she has only a single, large eye. In addition, he sees that she looks injured or beaten up as she is covered in wounds and wears tattered clothing. She does not have any friends, but Mamoru decides to be nice and spend time around her.\n\nThis game is a kinetic novel, a type of visual novel with no branching story lines and only one ending. It can be played through as fast as the player can read it. I would estimate that it would take the average person around two or two-and-a-half hours to get through the whole thing.\n\nTo start off with a positive aspect of this game, I thought the artwork was fairly good. It manages to be a pleasing combination between cute and creepy at the same time. The colors used in the game are more on the darker side giving it a kind of creepy feeling, but the design of the characters is rather cute in contrast.\n\nUnfortunately, most other aspects do not work well. The writing and characters are always the most important parts of any visual novel and the quality of them in [i]Love at First Sight[/i] is very mediocre. All of the characters in this game are incredibly two-dimensional and types of clich\u00e9s that we have all seen before. You have the protagonist who is little more than an empty shell nice guy self-insert for the player, Sachi who is the shy and lonely character you help, Akemi who is the one bubbling with energy, Rui who is a standard fare school bully, and so on. It is especially annoying when none of these characters are ever fleshed out. This is very true with Rui as she comes off as the most clich\u00e9d type of bully imaginable who is angry all the time for no real reason. The Sachi character really should have been developed more considering the whole quirk of the game is her character. Aside from her appearance, her unique characteristic of being a cyclops has almost no bearing on the story at all. She could have been depicted as a normal person with two eyes and the exact same character traits and the story could have played out the same. It is just a major disappointment to not see this aspect used at all.\n\nAnd that brings me to the other major problem with the game: the story. All in all, it is a very predictable high school romance story. The player-character meets a cute girl, they spend time together, go on dates, and be happy. I really do not think I am spoiling anything here. Nothing of substance happens in the story. There are no plot twists, no major developments. Even considering the short length of the game, this was a chore to complete.\n\nAlas, even the music itself is not that great. It quickly became repetitive and irritating.\n\nThere is one other aspect that I must comment on. In the bonus content that is unlocked after completing the game, the creator is pretty open about the fact that some of his fetishes (he mentions eating and scars) made their way into the game. A few scenes in the game depict Mamoru touching Sachi's various scars which was awkward enough during play, but knowing the creator's intentions just gives the scenes even more negative connotations. Is it really necessary to depict a girl with injuries just to satisfy some weird fetish? This type of writing is really inexcusable and should have been left out.\n\nOverall, this game is a disappointment.

And of course as a MC, white knight role is his priority to be uphold. As the story progress, romantic relationship developed between them, heartwarming & cute scenes come into their everyday lives.\n\nThere are several subjects that can actually be expanded & explained more (the game developer said himself it was a bit of rushed due to time factor) such as the bully's background story, MC's friends & the girl's relatives which I felt not satisfying enough. According to someone in discussion board, a sequel is in progress.. so yeah, will looking forward to find out the answers in the next installment, hopefully.\n\nOverall, it's still nice & enjoyable for a simple audience, my advise is, purchase it on discount price, give less expectation & you are good to go.

Maybe show why she only has one eye, have people be more surprised that there's a girl with one eye hanging around.

I like how the main character (Mamoru) is just genuinely interested in our one-eyed heroine. Sure, he was surprised -- like any normal human being would. But then he wasn't weirded it out by it and was kind of like your average guy falling slowly in love. I like, love, adore his friend, Tomoyuki because he's so tsundere and smart. The dialog he shared with Mamoru is (to me) really well thought, and felt like they had been friends for a long time. It might be a bad thing though, because our MC had just known him for 2 months but they could already share thoughts, in a way. \n\nAs what the author explained at the end of the game, this game could've been better if there was more time. So I was left a bit unsatisfied when it ended because it felt short. Still, it was a sweet journey with a very ... funny, interesting fetish put on. The EP you unlocked later on that talked about those fetishes are very cute too. I'm not into that but I can appreciate and wish happiness to the couple for sharing such ... ideals.\n\nThe negative notes I have about this game is how easily the conflict between the bully is solved (then again, time was limited for this game to be made), and Akemi's character isn't my best friend type. I think I relate more with Tomo and I can't stand overly energetic people but, hey, as a manga / fictional character, she works. She falls into that archetype so this is just preference issue, is all. \n\nThat said, I really wished that the author makes updates to add to the game to make it better and add more archs that was claimed to have been cut due to time.\n\nOVERALL: Don't expect much from this \"rushed\" game. Think of it as a light read that you can pick as you're waiting for another game to load.

fetishes.\"\n\n\"Love at First Sight\" Is a rather straightforward visual novel. Boy meets girl, girls bullied, they go through the stages of being friends and then romance. The charicters are well written, the art is well done save for a small lack of detail in a few scenes. The music fits rather well to boot. For a game made in two months due to procrastination and a deadline I think this speaks to about 98% of the clients playing it. It's a very good game with the amount of time it took to build it. Though I would love to see a patch where it adds all the things the author intended to be in the final cut.\nFor 10 dollars and the slightly short 3 hour playtime it's overpriced. Get it on sale but not for more than 50%. The creator disirves credit for all his work.\n\nAll in all you get a game with an engaging story and very well writing charicters. Though sad to say it has a lack of the common branching story line so its more like your reading a manga than playing a true visual novel. Grab it as you won't soon be forgeting the faceless protagonist and the one eyed beauty. (Oh yeah forgot to menton that) Or loudmouth, calm tom, ice stare lady, and shark toothed angry girl. You also won't forget the authors fetish for certain events that im not aposed to myself now that I'm typing it out.\n\n\"Wanna know how I got these scars?\"\n(Now imagine the Joker dressed in a

I don't know why I like it so much, but it's currently my favorite VN (not that I've played a lot).\n\nThe story is a really cute romance, with a nice, \"creepy-cute\" style, and some weird romantic parts thrown in to match that, but it's very enjoyable. There's nothing ecchi, so people won't think you're a pervert for liking an anime cyclops. Sachi is, of course, really cute. Play the game for her. <3\n\nIt's pretty short and progresses quickly, which could be seen as a con, but I like that.

game crash in my first 3 1/2 hours of game time making me play from a save from 20 minutes prior\n  -  Black screens you need to click through\n  -  The GUI was inconsistent within itself\n  -  The music was repetitive and it wasn't unusual to loop through a track multiple times in one scene\n  -  I had a few \"who wrote this?\" moments where dialog was awkward or an event that didn't make sense\n  -  No dialog options\n  -  One of the achievements requires you to play through the game in Japanese\n\nPositives\n + Story was pretty cute\n + The artwork was incredible charming\n + Sachi was an adorable character\n + I got the game while it was on sale for $2.49\n\nWith all of the above put it mind It should shape up to a negitive review, but the game does carry the apeal through it's 3 1/2 hours even through it's flaws.  I have to recommend this game to people who are turned on by the art or if you just really like cyclopes ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)", "timestamp_created": 1482827222,

though it's a kinetic novel (which means there's zero choices in the game) it still felt like a proper VN.\n\nThe fetishes that are very clearly displayed, didn't feel intrusive and were overall cute and endearing, if you're okay with a scar, feeding others your own food, and your girl getting punched (there is no actual scene of her getting punched but it was in dialog and it wasn't in a sexual way either) fetishes then this will be just fine for you too as it was for me.\n\nNow onto what it's about.\nYou're just some dude who meets this cyclops girl and she's cute and you fell in love with her at first sight of course, if you can't tell that from the name and pictures then you must be some kind of airhead, like a certain character from this game.\n\nNow the flaws.\n1. The music can be pretty bad at times though intentionally, I know this will be annoying to others but I was fine with it since I knew it was trying to portray a sort of off kilter and creepy (not scary creepy) vibe.\n\n2. The little cinemas where they tell you what act you're on are tween animated (look it up) though it's not too bad at times, at other times it makes me want to die a little since it's kinda cringy.\n\n3. No choices, this really sucked since I wanted a route without the fetish parts so the ending would have them be less close (Neutral end), a route where you'd abuse her yourself (bad end), or even a route where she's a masochist and you're a sadist or something (true end perhaps) since she did seem like the masochist type.\n\n[b]Overall I loved it and it tugged on my weeaboo heart strings but it's only worth it if it's under six dollars.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1482645564, "timestamp_updated": 1482645564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28602302": {"recommendationid": "28602302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089148594", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508847568}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc678\ub208 \ucde8\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4 \uc8fc\ub294\uac9c\n\ud55c\ub9c8\ub514\ub85c \ub9d0\ud558\uc790\uba74\n\uac13------------\uac9c\n\n2017-10-07\n\nhttp://charac3730.blog.me/221112096816\n\ubc88\uc5ed \uc644\ub8cc", "timestamp_created": 1482598981, "timestamp_updated": 1507421080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642857", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28581760": {"recommendationid": "28581760", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118852472", "num_games_owned": 533, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482563270}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5e78\u3061\u3083\u3093\u304c\u5927\u597d\u304d\u3067\u3059\u3002\u521d\u3081\u3066\u91d1\u9aea\u30ed\u308a\u306b\u5acc\u306a\u6c17\u6301\u3061\u3092\u611f\u3058\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1482556494, "timestamp_updated": 1482556494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28468574": {"recommendationid": "28468574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198244925466", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482158230}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful with a wonderful story.", "timestamp_created": 1482158346, "timestamp_updated": 1482158346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28320585": {"recommendationid": "28320585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202525417", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481510012}, "language": "schinese", "review": "[strike]\u4e00\u7bc7\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u7684\u82f1\u8bed\u9605\u8bfb\u6750\u6599[/strike]\n\n[b]\u8bf7\u4e0d\u8981\u5c06\u8fd9\u90e8\u6e38\u620f\u4e0eteaching feeling\u4f5c\u6bd4\u8f83[/b]\n\u4e00\u90e8\u6cbb\u6108\u5411\u7684gal\uff0c\u6d41\u7a0b3h+\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u5c31\u80fd[b]\u5168\u90e8\u5185\u5bb9[/b]\u901a\u5173\uff08\u4ec5\u6307\u56db\u7ea7\u82f1\u8bed\u6c34\u5e73\uff09\n\u6709\u70b9\u730e\u5947\u7684\u52a0\u597d\u611f\u5ea6\u65b9\u5f0f[spoiler]Mamoru\uff1a\u522b\u4eba\u6478\u5934\u6211\u6478\u75a4[/spoiler]\n\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u914d\u97f3\u4f46\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4e2d\u4e8c\u75c5\u5c31\u5e94\u8be5\u81ea\u5df1\u4e2d\u4e8c\u6ee1\u6ee1\u7684\u5ff5\u51fa\u6765\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5305\u542b\u5267\u900f\u5185\u5bb9\n[spoiler]\u867d\u7136rui\u662f\u4e2a\u8d1d\u9f7f\u4f46\u6700\u540e\u90a3\u6ce2\u52a9\u653b\u6253\u7684\u771f\u4ed6\u5988\u6f02\u4eae[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1481509870, "timestamp_updated": 1481509891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501618", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28229396": {"recommendationid": "28229396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326213075", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481077126}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Graphics are noticeable, narration results a bit monocled.[/h1]\n\nI do not recommend this game as in my opinion it is lacking content and some events are resulting slightly rushed.\nDialogues result too simple, characters are actually nice but lack personality and seem to be pushed forcibly in the story.\n\nThe story is a generic romantic encounter between a boy and a... wait wha, a cyclops...!\nBesides the plot lacking events, what seemed out of place in this game to me is how plain our main heroine is presented; a silent non reactive shy girl having a single eye (with no utter explanation to it, nor affecting particularly the main story) being bullied. After -obviously- getting noticed by senpai, she starts opening up bit by bit, et cetera, et cetera.\nSo the only \"particular\" trait of her would be her eye and wounds presented upon her sprites which lack background story.\n\nI am not understating the developer's work and time put in this game. Actually, the art is quite interesting and particular (mostly appreciated the background art!), music is just right at the point. \n[i]What makes this game too ordinary is not the fact of it being a Kinetic Novel.[/i]\nIt may need some retouches as the developer noticed themselves, but its basics might create a good starting point.\nI purchased Hitomebore during sales and honestly if I were to

They don't all have much direct explanation of their backgrounds, with most development coming from a scenic style of writing. For those who are pretentious enough, or unfortunate enough to know what that means, you know that its where the characters primarily express themselves through the context of a scene. This lets you read into their character from their direct parts, rather than necessarily just being told what to think. There are parts where they will tell you mostly of how to think of the characters, but the real thing is that there doesn't seem to be a world that the characters are in, rather some inconceivable void past the tinges of a world at the edges of your vision.\n\nAfter all fo the halabaloo, it has good writing, but not much of it.

It is essentially, a simple love story minus the depth and complexity that most novels have.\n\nFirst things first, I like the art style \u2013 it has that indie vibe that makes it stands out. It\u2019s not over-the-top beautifully wonderful that make your eyes moist \u2013 but it works nonetheless. Thumbs up!\n\nUnfortunately the music is, for the most part, colourless. There are a couple of songs that are passable, but all of the tracks repeat themselves too often, so it\u2019s better played with the volume on low. Thumbs down.\n\nNow for the main story. It\u2019s\u2026 barely above average I guess. There\u2019s just no real \u2018meat\u2019 to it. For me, a visual novel (or any game for that matter) needs to either be entertaining, exciting, original, funny, shocking, or at the very least, somewhat interesting \u2013 and sadly, Love at First Sight scarcely delivers in a couple of those categories.\n\nOverall, if you\u2019re a heavy fan of visual novels, and see this one on a sale, than maybe this will be for you. It\u2019s okay for light reading and, well, it DOES have a cute girl with one eye.

There really is nothing that stands out too much in this VN:  Boy falls in love with girl, girl reciprocates, they date, she meets his friends, he meets her relative, girl learns to stand up for herself... everything here is something anyone over 15-18 has already seen or experienced, whether first hand experience or through an entertainment medium.  \n\nThe story doesn't overstay its welcome, though it'd have been worthwhile if we could have had more unique scenarios. Backgrounds are heavily reused, there aren't a lot of variety to sprites, characters are not voiced.  BUT despite these flaws (if you would call them that), the entire story is a warm, feel-good experience.  Characters have well-defined, one-dimensionsal personalities, but Sachi especially exhibits some growth, which is nice to see.  Though initially weak and spineless, Sachi is likeable and it's fun seeing her mature overly the course of the story.  Sachi's eye is initially viewed as something to be embarassed about, but Mamoru is not repulsed, or even attracted, by this unique aspect.  The eye isn't a big problem; very little about the story would be changed even if Sachi had two eyes. It differentiates Sachi but doesn't define her.  -------> [Good moral to glean]\n\nTo sum it up, the story/art is pretty generic, but it'll make you feel good inside.  It's worth a read or two.  \n\nI'd recommend this to anyone with a few hours to kill, or as an intro to a VN rookie.", "timestamp_created": 1467694835, "timestamp_updated": 1467694835, "voted_up":

Plot revolves around the protagonist falling in love with a cyclops, who's shy and has been bullied because of her condition. His two friends help him out a little bit after he gets closer to her, and they all become good friends in the end. I really felt that the protagonist was a bit too forward and chatty.\n\nHe kept asking all of these questions, in his attempts to be friends with the cyclops, that it came off as cringey to me. It toned down in the later acts, but still, it was awkward and weird. Especially since his friend, Akemi, is supposed to be the chatterbox in the group.\n\nThe acts felt short to me, but surprisingly, I managed to finish the game in about two hours. The extras unlocked after beating the game is pretty interesting, as the developer revealed he had time constraints when making this game, and thought about making it a doujinshi.\n\nWhich, for those that don't know, is a manga. I highly recommend going through all the extra content after finishing the game, and viewing the epilogue scenes. I don't really have anything bad to say about the game, since this was made during time constraints, but I would like to say that I'll be supporting any future releases by the dev, who made a great game.\n\nThought the transitions where you had to press enter several times, and going from classroom to the halls, was pretty cute and immersive. I can see some people finding that off-putting though, but regardless, and like most games, it's all up to preference.\n\nOh, and the game is more of a kinetic novel than anything, which doesn't have choices.", "timestamp_created": 1467081690, "timestamp_updated": 1467141677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534884", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23879251": {"recommendationid": "23879251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259448227", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509299315}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u044f \u0432\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0441 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0437\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434\u0430", "timestamp_created": 1467076656, "timestamp_updated": 1503237447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23869995": {"recommendationid": "23869995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035405763", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467025947}, "language": "english", "review": "it's okay. werid from time to time (scars fetish), but cute. nice story. nice artwork.", "timestamp_created": 1467053133, "timestamp_updated": 1467053133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23855129": {"recommendationid": "23855129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075152276", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467487477}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud751..\ud751", "timestamp_created": 1467016750, "timestamp_updated": 1467016750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23836444": {"recommendationid": "23836444", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993219560", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466913456}, "language": "english", "review": "I RECOMMEND THIS VISUAL NOVEL!

sitiations, so if you spect see that on the game you will not find it here.\nsecond, this is not a monster girl story, and our protagonist is not a cyclop, but a normal girl with a malformation, that cause her to be \"ugly\" for society,she is bullied because of this, as you probably already guest, she also have a weird obsession with her injuries, that part was a little creepy, but is nothing really disgusting or that you close the laptop and run, the art is very cool, despite the fact that every character look like a shark or like a depressive whale.\nthats all, by the way, the game don't

Although many things in the game could have been improved, it was sill solid as a linear and sraightforward story. The concep itself is unique, not one you see too often; a heroine with monster-like features. If the game had more time to work on this, it could have reached stars and beyond; but I'm not complaining with what was given, after all the creator himself stated that he had limited time. I personally would like a patch here which would give interactive routes and cause more strife between the characters. A route for the troublesome blonde! Now that would be interesting! \n\nOverall, could it have done better? If given more time, a whole lot! But if you do buy this game now you probably won't regret it, although you might feel an emptiness in the overall scene of things, it still gives you a story with a lot to ponder on about post gameplay. \nReally looking forward to the next vn by this developer; I know it takes a lot out of you to make, but you seriously should!

More than once there were times you'd expect there to be more shown, but he just ends up alluding to events and then skipping right over them (presumably cuts made to get the game done on time). The story with the main antagonist ended in a very unsatisfactory manner, though I will refrain from expanding on that any further to avoid spoilers. Most of the side characters also didn't really get as much time as I would have liked in order to get to know them better. Also - unless you share in some of the creator's fetishes for things like injuries - a lot of the dialog will seem forced, weird or unnecessary as they are mainly tacked on to serve his own indulgences.\n\nThe art style is nice and the main selling point that drew me to this title. Though as with everything else about this game, it would have been nice to have had more of it, for instance there was very little by way of CG stills/cutscenes. However, it does have a far more coherent and enjoyable aesthetic than most other amateur VN offerings and deserves a fair bit of praise for that alone.\n\nSound was just so-so. Some of the music could use a bit of work, there were some grating off key notes thrown in inexpertly throughout a few of the tracks that detracted from my enjoyment, but otherwise the soundtrack was ok and fit the story well enough.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it, but the creator really should put another 2-4 months into completing this, then this would be well worth the asking price and a highly recommended title for those who enjoy quirky VNs.

As far as dialogue is concerned, it fit and made sense, yet I still found it slightly dull somehow, with exceptions for all of the puns and reoccuring themes.\n\nIn the extras the developer said that he rushed the game for a release date and procrastinated for some time. This is evident in a few places, which are not that horrible, and for which I was surprised for him to site as examples of this. The greatest effect of this though is actually the limitation of certain characters in regards to their presence, the scope of their personalities, the amount of scenes that they are in, their actual appearance in the game, and segments of story that would make sense to include, or would have been nice to have in it.\n\nFor some reason despite wondering why the affection object character, Sachi Usui, was depicted as being constantly injured and wearing bandages in screenshots before buying it, I didn't realize how much of a fetish game this is. It contains no nudity or purely sexual content, however Sachi is almost entirely based on fetish fufilment, and fetish interests are very heavy throughout the story. It didn't bother me, however it did catch me off guard.

I will try to keep this completely spoiler-free, which means I will probably not talk much about it story-wise.\n\n- Story and Characters\n\nYou must have noticed that the heroine of this VN isn't your mainstream moe heroine, she's way more cute and interesting. I won't say anything else about her, because I found out that actually getting to know her through the story is what made this such a great experience for me.\n\nThe story is short and the cast small, but I loved every part of it, even the slightly strange ones.\nYou have two very likeable characters as your support casting, who are not just filling up the space, but instead have their own things going on. Their personalities are also built very clear, so that the way they act and interact with you and the other characters feels very natural.\n\nAlso, don't forget to check the Extras after you finish. There are a few extra scenes there.\n\n- VN\n\nNow, for the technical stuff.\nThis is a linear visual novel with a single route. Which means it's more like a digital book than a game itself, and to be fair most visual novels are exactly that. I would say the greatest selling point of this kind of product is that you get an experience similar to those you would get from reading books, comics or manga, but with the extras allowed by the medium used to convey the story.\n\nA story can be conveyed in many different forms. A linear visual novel allows you to attach shifting scenes to every piece of dialogue, with characters in different poses over backgrounds. You are also allowed to place pictures drawn for special events, and in this game's case, even small cutscenes for every chapter title. And finally, wrap it all up with music fitting for every moment. This is an experience that is most close to reading a novel, with many additionals you'd only get from it being digital.\nIf this is what you came here looking for, then Love at First Sight is indeed what you want.\n\n- Art\n\nAs for the art, I feel particularly drawn to the hard lines and the painting style, which reminds me of another VN that I live very much, which is Danganronpa. The animated cutscenes are very well made and looked really cute. I enjoyed it.\n\n- Music\n\nThe music in the game feels really nice to the ears and blends well with the ambience. Most of the times, I barely even notice it's presence, as I felt it was part of the scene itself and not just something on the background. My regards to kyou1110 for the great work, though I did like every song of the game.\n\n- Conclusion\n\nFinally, I want to congratulate Ray-K for making this great game. Making a game isn't easy, and making a game by yourself is a hard challenge. But, making a game of this quality by yourself is no short of heroic. People like you and Toby Fox are what I consider heroes in this industry.

An enjoyable reading for a relaxing afternoon. \nThe story itself is a pretty straightforword romance tale. There're no surprising plot-turning events.

Her character development is also smooth and believable, and gets you attached to her from start to end. Unfortunately other characters could use a more polish, maybe especially for Mayumi. \nArt design is the selling point here IMO. Ray-K's heavy, rough and somewhat eerie style gives the game a distinguishing look just like the heroine. It may not look as exquisite as some of the other VNs, but it's stunningly beautiful and fits the theme very well. \nMusic is  pretty simple, nothing stands out but certainly not annoying. Missing Love is a nice little piece.   \nThere're also some fun stuff to check out in Extras after finishing the story if you are interested.

I had always wanted him to continue this game but after I played it myself I see why he didn't. This game is simple, the creator even bashes himself for doing this in the afternotes, however I like the game more cause of it. There's no way to fail this game, no way to go down a path you didn't want to take, no way to mess something up. The music, as simplistic as it is, is very nice and catchy and changes somewhat frequently, my most favorite track was when there was drama with Rui. The story is nice and simple, shy girl who has no courage or anything like that and gets bullied, falls in love with a boy who loves her back, she slowly comes out of her shell and even stands up to her bully, an almost cliche type of character development but at least it's there, some games the characters develop so little during hours of gameplay if at all. The only thing that really makes Sachi different is the fact that she's a cyclops, other than that she's no different from anyone else, and as a guy who doesn't judge on appearances I easily see why Ma-Kun (don't want to type his name wrong) was attracted to her, heck I'd date her if she existed. Could this game be longer, yes (note it says I have like 7 hours into the game but I had left it running while did other things) but just because it's short is really only something that an individual has to decides is a good or bad thing. Do you want a game that you play for hours and not get anywhere significant (like most rpg's) or do you want to play a game that's short but be entertained while you play for those few short hours. Is this a perfect game, no but most aren't, I personally would've liked to see Tomo and Akemi get more and more intimate and actually admit how they feel, round 2 of Ms. Bully (Rui) and Ms. Upbeat (Akemi), and even a b*tch slap delivered to Rui via the small scarred hand of Sachi, but those are personal nitpicks, maybe in a continuation of this story and again I would prefer it this style, simple straight to the point, just something that you'll sit down to for an hour or two just to enjoy a nice little romance story without the filler of anime or the images of manga or the complexity of a dating sim (cause let's be honest some of these styles of games can be pretty complex with their choice/path system and all sorts of flags) I would personally rate this a 4/5, it's simple, fun, no hassle, just an overrall carefree game.

point. \n\nThe characters are pretty interesting and likeable for the most part, although the MC is a bit of a goose at times and a tad pushy but hey, considering how short the game is (2 or so hours) a fair amount of development goes on and any shortcomings in character development are hardly noticible.  The pacing and story is great with only a few dull moments here and there.\n\nThis isn't a typical romance VN. Its not overly cheesy, has more going on thematically then just romance including some kind of unsettling moments, and other characters (well 2 out of the 3 more minor ones) actually have a significant role to play in the story, so you don't  feel like you're trapped following a hapless protag around while he tries to get laid.\n\nPros\n- Great art style. which is mostly what caught my eye about the game (heuheuheuhueh)\n- Music is pretty decent too.\n- The story is interesting enough and has some pretty cool moments\n- SACHI!!!!!!!\n- Short and good for when you don't feel like taking on a 50+ hour epic with 1000+ choices.\n- No choices (could be a pro or con)\n- Got oddly aroused during a certain scene and now find myself asking some hard questions.\n\nCons\n- It could be a bit longer but by the Devs own admission, he rushed the game to reach a deadline and didn't get to add more routes/ choices etc.\n- Sometimes the protag is kind of annoying, but hey, writing facless yet relatible characters that players can project onto is hard.\n\n\n10/10 would date a cyclops gorl again.", "timestamp_created": 1458045926, "timestamp_updated": 1458045926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529061", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21846834": {"recommendationid": "21846834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040427321", "num_games_owned": 1090, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458024554}, "language": "english", "review": "While this game doesn't seem to be the highest budget VN you'll see on Steam, It certainly is worth the price, considering the beautiful artwork and fairly interesting story.\n\nOutside of that...

There's only one path to take, you have no conversation options and it's basically just a pimped out graphic novel for you to click through. The story is a bit lackluster and \"typical\" as far as <insert yourself here> VN's go. \n\nEven after all these faults, why do I recommend this game? Because I learned a lot about the process and how this game came to be via the bonus content that you unlock after finishing the game and I have a lot of respect for the creator and how he handled his situation. This is basically a one-man-show and he created it in the shortest time period. Mad props.\nAlso: The art style resonates with me. It's creepy-adorable and I kind of want to see a full color graphic novel type manga from this creator. \n\nPS: I'm glad the creator specified in the bonus content that he has a fetish for feeding and scar touching.

The artstyle is really nice and well done. The music is a bit meh but it does what it needs to do. Though there's nothing explicitly NSFW in the story, there are a few on the nose moments; it kinda makes the game feel more innocent and cute. \n\nUnfortunately the game is really short, about one to two hours, maybe three if you're a really slow reader or just admiring the art. Furthermore, the game feels rushed (what with its two month development period) and incomplete with lots of things being left out, it feels as if the game is like an unfinished canvas, it just needs a little more. The story is also pretty generic as well as being linear but that's a slight nitpick. \n\nHonestly i wouldn't suggest buying this game at full price but it's definitely a cute little love story to buy on discount. \nI really want a sequel!", "timestamp_created": 1451474975, "timestamp_updated": 1451474975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20057504": {"recommendationid": "20057504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109785219", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464575216}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u53d7\u4e86teaching felling\u7684\u5f71\u54cd \u6211\u7a81\u7136\u89c9\u5f97\u8fd9\u5bb6\u516c\u53f8\u753b\u7684\u59b9\u5b50\u597d\u53ef\u7231\u554a \u7136\u540e\u4e0d\u5c0f\u5fc3\u5c31\u4e70\u4e86\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f \u4ee5\u524d\u5f00\u59cb\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u5996\u602a\u59b9\u5b50\u5c31\u662f\u86ee\u559c\u6b22\u7684 \u73a9\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u4e4b\u540e\u5c31\u6df1\u7231\u7684\u4e0d\u80fd\u81ea\u62d4 orz \u63a8\u8350\u4e00\u4e2a", "timestamp_created": 1451366303, "timestamp_updated": 1451366303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496278", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20056682": {"recommendationid": "20056682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003878164", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508124912}, "language": "english", "review": "I greatly enjoyed this game...but I think it could have been longer.

As a personal fan of Ray-Kbys' artwork, this piece displays some of his most inspired 2-D animations, which are short, but are used to astounding effect. This being a fairly short piece (I finished all content within 5 hours), hearing that this may have been a full-blown dating sim game with a branching story (if Ray-K hadn't procrastinated until 2 moths before) raises my hopes that Ray-Kbys may try his more determined hand at a full-blown dating sim one day.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who likes vanilla romance visual novels, people who like cute anime games, people who like unique artwork, people who are into injury/cyclops girls/sickeningly sweet romance fetishes, and just people with good humor, as this VN displays all these qualities and more. Just enough character development is placed into the story to entice veteran 2D romance enthusiasts and critics of the genre alike. As an added benefit, the cards for this game sell for nearly as much as the game itself on 50% off atm, assuming you don't wish to collect them for the rare adorable-cyclops-girl Steam backgrounds, so buy away!\n\nWell worth $5, still worth $10 for VN enthusiasts.

[i]Love at First Sight[/i] is a pretty straightforward high school romance VN. There's no ero in the game itself, but it has a few ero-guro undertones that might be off-putting for some. Even so, there's a certain soft grace to it all; Ray-K's painterly style brings warmth and tenderness to every scene, catching the restrained giddiness of young love in a way that might be lost with cleaner, flatter designs. It is, in a word, comfy.\n\nThe characters are likeable, for the most part, with Sachi standing head and shoulders over any run-of-the-mill moeblob love interest. She invites sympathy and the urge to protect, but her vulnerability never really grates. The music doesn't stand out by any means, but its gentleness supports the cozy atmosphere well.\n\nThere is very little beyond the story's single path, unfortunately \u2014 about two hours of content in all. Even the most casual reader will chew through it quickly, and depending on their tastes, they'll probably be left wanting more. It's perhaps not enough to warrant the full $10. But if it's on sale and you have five bucks to spare, time spent on crisp autumn back-streets with a cute cyclops girl is time well invested.\n\nAdmittedly, I might be biased here; that wide, bottomless eye will ease open your chest and grope the scars. But isn't that the point?\n\nPick this up if you enjoy cutely macabre aesthetics, monster girls, romance, and if you see it on sale.\n\n---\n+ Cute monster girl heroine\n+ Cozy autumn setting\n+ Warm, comfy art style\n+ The extra features serve as a fun little epilogue and development backstory\n+ When you're done with the story and extras, check the creator's Pixiv for a bit more\n\n- Only one story path\n- That one path is a little bare-bones and straightforward\n- At 2-3 hours, the VN is extremely short \u2014 perhaps too short to justify a $10 price tag", "timestamp_created": 1446899810, "timestamp_updated": 1446901075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.813939", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18909500": {"recommendationid": "18909500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004018408", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511179033}, "language": "russian", "review": "[h1] \u041a\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b \u0431\u044b \u043c\u043d\u0435, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044f \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0443 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434 - \u044f \u0431\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043b [/h1]\n\n\u0425\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441 \u0443\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u043d\u0430\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438\u043d\u044e - \u0440\u043e\u0431\u043a\u0430\u044f, \u0431\u043e\u044f\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f, \u0431\u043e\u044f\u0441\u0449\u0430\u044f\u0441\u044f \u0432\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446\u0430 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c (\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u043b\u0438\u0448\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0444\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0438), \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0434\u043e\u0432\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0433\u0440\u0435\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0446\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f. \u0412 \u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e\u043a, \u0432\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u043a \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430\u043c, \u043d\u0438 \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439, \u043d\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0451\u0440\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0437\u043d\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0446. \u0418\u0437 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u0432\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0431\u044b \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0443, \u043d\u043e, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b \u0441\u0430\u043c \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440, \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0438 \u0441 \u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0439 \u043e\u0444\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0439.

While it may not have the action, cast, or production budget of bigger name VNs, I actually prefer small and simple ones like this. The whole thing is over in about two to three hours, but it manages to tell its story well enough.\nStarting with the positives of the game, the between-chapter animations are adorable. The very first time I saw one I let out an audible squeal that I am not ashamed of. Theyre simple but well executed in ways that will make your heart melt. Continuing with the uguu-train, Sachi herself is a very adorable love interest and easily one of my favorites, even out of bigger name VNs that Ive played. Although her character isnt anything new, the person who made the game knew what they were doing and how to use Sachi for maximum effectiveness. I would take one Sachi over a hundred Sakura Matous any day. \nThe supporting cast of the VN is also very enjoyable, however scarse they are. There is only six named characters in the entire VN, and while that is a disappointing thing, the cahracters are all likeable enough that you wont even care. Akemi and her explosively cheerful attitude and Tomo's indifference play off of each other like poetry, and I really enjoy seeing characters like them. As stated before, Sachi is one of my favorite VN characters. She makes my heart sing. The main character, Mamoru is bland as white bread, but that is of course to be expected of a VN protag so that the reader can realte more. If he went around kicking puppies, then I dont think many people could relate.\nUnfortunately after the good must come the bad, and Ill start with the worst offender that youll be dealing with the whole game: The music is terrible. It sounds like a cheap MIDI on a fifteen second loop. I understand that the game was made by a single person, and I understand that you might not be an author AND a composer, but its still a negative.\nThe plot is a standard VN highschool plot: Boy transfers in, boy has small or nonexistant group of friends, finds outcast girl, helps her come out of her shell, kiss kiss fall in love, and then help her overcome her main issue in the story. If youre expecting twists and turns, then you are a fool. While the plot and character archetypes are all very known by this point, I do have to mention that they are all well done, especially for how long the VN is.\nFor the praise I gave Akemi earlier, I must tack on some sins as well. The game doesnt allow her to be as expressive as she is due to the limited facial expressions and poses that it provides. This doesnt detract from her character of my enjoyment of the VN, but it does leave me wanting more out of her that I will be unable to have.\nNow we have to get to the elephant in the room: Why does Sachi have two tear ducts when she only has one eye? Huh? Seriously though, the elephant is the scar scenes. I had no idea I was into that kinda thing, but it's said you get a new fetish everyday, right? While the \"normal and well adjusted\" people playing this will inevitably be very weirded out, I welcome the scar scenes for all they are, and enjoyed them. I didnt see it as Mamoru just being a creeper, but instead as a show that Sachi trusts him enough to let him touch her in places she's been hurt at. That being said, the fact that Mamoru himself points out to the reader how strange it is to be doing it does not actually make it any less strange. In fact, shining a light on it like that only brings more attention to it, as opposed to letting the scenes flow natually as they should.\nOverall Id say this visual novel is fairly high on my list, as I enjoyed it immensely. It may just be my love of monster girls and apparently scars talking, but I give this game a very deserved 8.5/10. Id highly recommend this game.

The supporting characters are well done as well. They actually felt like living, breathing people as opposed to the common Mary Sue. \nThe game is short, I'm not going to lie about that, but there is not a problem with a short game; problems arise with poor pacing, which usually goes hand in hand with short length. That is not the case with L@FS, while the game only took me two hours to complete, the pacing was impeccable. While I would love it to be longer, thats not really an issue with the game but more that Sachi is really cute and I didn't want it to end.\nSeriously, the pacing is good enough that they could extrapolate a 6 or so episode OVA.\nThe extras were fun as well, with I believe 4 additional scenes available that gives a nice epilogue to the characters and an afterward by the author. \nSeriously if there is one thing I will say about this game is that it has staying power. You might play it once, possibly twice, and it is short, but in that short time cements Sachi in the reader's hearts. \n", "timestamp_created": 1440243903, "timestamp_updated": 1440243903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501067", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17655328": {"recommendationid": "17655328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011429592", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441168964}, "language": "english", "review": "A great visual novel with turly enjoyable characters.

Anyways.  Actual review.\n\nAs I said above, the novel is a complete package, although it does feel a bit rushed (which the author recognized and apologized for).  However, it is a very sweet and cute story about love between two very different people (except for their seemingly shared scar fetish... still don't get that).  It sadly doesn't touch on the WHYS or HOWS of Sachi's existence as a monoeye, mainly focusing on their relationship and the drama she faces in school from being bullied and at home.  But she's such a cute and endearing character that you don't even really mind that.  All in all, I think it's worth the $10 I spent on it, and I'm hoping that the author revists this character and this world that he's built for more novels, hopefully improving or re-releasing this game with more content, new routes, etc.\n\nPlease note, to fully appreciate the game.. you probably need to already have some sort of positive bias for anime waifus and monstergirls in general.

Everyone's touched upon that. I'm sure Ray-K feels that it should be longer, too, but as he lays out in the afterword, he gave himself too short of a deadline. Having to make almost every aspect of the game himself, from the story to the art to some of the music, it fell short of his own expectations. Honestly, even I was a little disappointed by the way the story abruptly ends without resolving some important and interesting plot threads, but after reading the included words from the creator, I felt a little more sympathetic. \n\nHowever, even if it's a little stunted, it's extremely charming. I don't remember the last time a VN like this has made me go \"HHHNNNNGGGGGGHHH!!!!\" over a character so many times. Sachi is unbelievably cute, with irresistably sweet moe elements slathered on so heavily I think I almost went into cardiac arrest. The protagonist's name is 'Mamoru,' or 'to protect,' and you'll almost certainly end up following that sentiment. Once I learned about Sachi's problems, I immediately had a burning passion to protect her and make things better for her. She's mind-bendingly cute. I don't know how she [i]wouldn't[/i] melt the ice around your heart. The artist clearly has a deep passion for her, and it shows; the romance with her has a lot of impact. Others have mentioned that her one-eyedness isn't 'utilized' enough, and she could easily have any other disorder; however, I feel like not focusing [i]too[/i] much on her specific disorder made the romance feel less directly fetishistic, which worked out well. \n\nOther than the heart-explodingly adorable heroine, the art is very charming and somehow satisfying to look at. The story is a little simple, but it's very sweet, a heartwarming sort of tale with a few little surprises and victories to keep you going. I found the banter between Tomo, Akemi and Mamoru to be a little tiring sometimes; as much as I liked the three of them, they kept going through the same tired routine of chastising Akemi for being too energetic over and over again, and their banter felt a little hackneyed. Still, they were charming, too, and it all left a good impression.\n\nThere's an antagonist character, and I won't give too much away, but you'll absolutely hate her at first. Then there's a section which might change your mind a little, and then just when it seems we'll get some character development... the game just ends. It ends on a much-anticipated scene, too, so again, I can't say the ending wasn't a letdown, but the rest of the game makes up for it. \n\nWhat else? Well, there's not much else to it. The music is a little discordant at times, but not unpleasant, easy enough to listen to. The backgrounds are all nicely drawn, there's some nice little animations in between the chapters, and the cute bandage-themed UI really adds to the game's charm. There are some surprising moments of fetish play related to stroking Sachi's scars, but it actually turns out to be pretty cute, and the game never veers too much into indecent territory to ruin its sweetness. While the protagonist was a little generic, I really appreciated that he wasn't creepy or perverted like most VN protagonists. He had a sincere desire to protect Sachi, and it was easy to empathize with him. \n\nSo, overall, it's a short story and it could use a little more fleshing out, but I certainly don't regret the purchase. It's totally bursting with charm, and will definitely lighten your mood.

Published by the folks at Sekai Project, this high school romance chronicles the blossoming relationship between a shy girl named Sachi Usui and a transfer student called Mamarou. What is so distinguishing about this generic plot I hear you ask? Well, if the game\u2019s picture hasn\u2019t given it away already, Sachi happens to be a Cyclops. The novel\u2019s leading lady was born with a single giant eye and no nose\u2026 although that isn\u2019t too odd, as anime characters tend to be lacking in the schnoz department. Love between a human and a monster girl sounds weird to me, but then again what do I know? Monster Musume sells by the bucket load so clearly there is a market out there for geeks who lust after mythological creatures.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nOur unorthodox tale of love begins with Mamarou bumping into a tearful Sachi. The ocular challenged cutie is feeling low, as a nasty classmate has been tormenting her. Although taken aback by her distinct appearance, Mamarou cannot get Sachi out of his head after their inaugural encounter. Wanting to get to know her better Mamarou begins to meet up with Sachi during recess. After learning that Sachi is an avid reader he begins to woo her with a stockpile of manga before eventually asking her out to a movie. Ah, so that\u2019s what I have been doing wrong. I keep wasting money on flowers and chocolates. Next time I try to court a beauty I will shower her with comics instead.\n\nLove at First Sight\u2019s supporting cast, which you can count on one hand, includes Mamarou\u2019s two best friends. Akemi is a bubbly lass blessed with a motor mouth and is the polar opposite of Tomonori who is much more reserved and sombre. Although likable, Mamarou\u2019s chums are fairly one-dimensional and no I\u2019m not talking about the way they are drawn. The same applies to Rui \u2013 the bully who picks on Sachi. Always seen with a scowl on her face, she is presented as a stereotypical troublemaker who preys on the meek. Perhaps the most fleshed out character from the bunch is Sachi\u2019s aunt. She is initially presented as a cold-hearted foster parent, but the novel\u2019s later chapters reveal that her relationship with Sachi is a bit more complex than that.\n\nVERDICT\n\nMy rating for Love at First Sight is three stars. It\u2019s a sweet short story brought to life by some striking artwork. Creepy Cute is the artist responsible for creating the novel and it must be said that he lives up to his moniker. Although the graphics have an eerie quality to them he still manages to make the scar covered Sachi look adorable. Even though the story is sold on starring a mono-eyed girl the narrative doesn\u2019t dwell too deeply on Sachi\u2019s looks and reads like a standard teen romance. The only thing weird about the plot is Sachi\u2019s fondness for having her wounds caressed. Is this a clever way of exploring intimacy without resorting to potentially controversial sex scenes? Nah. In the extras section the author openly admits to having a scar fetish.\n\nI would award Love at First Sight a higher score if it weren\u2019t for its steep asking price. The whole thing can be read in just two hours, which isn\u2019t great given that the download costs \u00a37.00. A bit more content would have been nice, especially as Sachi\u2019s final confrontation with Rui feels a tad rushed. Due to time constraints (the whole project was made in a couple of weeks to meet a convention deadline) there are also no branching paths to explore, which hurt the title\u2019s replay value. Those quibbles aside, I still give Love at First Sight a thumbs up. Sachi\u2019s plight should resonate with any readers who suffer from shyness, victims of bullying or anyone who has self-esteem issues pertaining to their physical appearance. Don\u2019t let the cost put you off sampling this treat.

Beyond this point I will try not to delve too deep into the story as to spoil it but some points in the story I feel essential to this review.\n\nThe point of reference for my opinion is that I think Clannad and Clannad After Story are the best works ever. No play, movie, opera, etc. can compare.\nI'm not an expert on anime or trying to say that my opinion is the way it must be, this is just my point of reference.\nWith that in mind, I picked this game (VN) with no great expectations.\n\nI was blown away by this simple beautiful story.\n\nThere are only 6 characters (other than minor players) in the whole story.\nThe drawings are simple but I think they are elegant. They convey the right mood at the right time in line with the story line.\nThe music simple as well, but I found it to be moving similar to the music in Clannad.\n\nThe heroine in the story has a physical deformity and suffers at the hands of a bully. The bully, as all bullies do, sees a weakness and attacks leaving injuries and scars. If you have never suffered at the hands of a bully, you probably cannot truly feel the plight our heroine goes through. The bully does this because our heroine is weak, but I think she is so strong to keep going and not give up. But she is not aided by anyone until our hero shows up. It's sad but this is a story that plays out so often for real everywhere. In the story no one says or does anything. I think that is just as bad as the bullying itself.\n\nAnyway the heroine is scared physically from the attacks. These are physical scars but I see them as emotional scars. So when there is reference to our heroine asking the hero to 'touch her scars' I don't see that as a 'fetish' on the part of the author. I see that as her letting the hero into her most vulnerable spot - her deepest feelings - and he is touching the scars on her very being. Again I see this on an emotional level not physical and I don't think any two people can be closer than that.\n\nOther characters in the story blend well with the plot. One of the hero's friends is very outgoing and one is almost zombie like. I think many people can relate because I think many people have friends like that. Throughout the story they stay true to character but you also watch their characters develop. The aunt of the heroine seems aloof but as the story develops, her character really comes through. Then there is the bully. Enough said.\n\nThis has been referred to as a typical high school romance type situation. But I got so much more out of it. I really liked the character development and the story line. I thought it had depth and though it appeared simple it was actually quite complex and elegant. In the end I wound up playing this straight through from start to finish in about 5 hours (not the fastest by any means) but I just couldn't stop. I thought it was that good.\n\nSPOILER ALERT:\nIt was just nice to see a VN like this where the good guys win - ordinary people (even our one eyed heroine) doing extraordinary things. I wish my act was as together in High School as these characters.\n\nThe author offers apologies for shortcomings he sees with the 'game'.  Though it is not really a game but rather a VN, I still see this as a great experience that I would have gladly paid triple the amount to play. I hope he will make another because I just thought this was that well done.", "timestamp_created": 1432872538, "timestamp_updated": 1432872538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16048088": {"recommendationid": "16048088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042046002", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434316698}, "language": "english", "review": "So uh... This is a review...\n\nI was aware of this game (and Ray-Kbys) even before Sekai decided to pick it up. When I heard news of the game getting translated I literally was like \"MOM! GET THE CAMERA!\" (Happy)\n\nAnyway, first thing to note this is a static visual novel, this means there are no alternative paths or events which really happen in the game, which is slightly saddening as there are a few things in the game which feel a bit left out...\n\nIn terms of the story, well it's pretty much in the game's description - You meet a one eyed girl, she's cute and fragile, [b]YOU WILL LOVE HER![/b] The game is fairly short, roughly 2 hours long if you're a slow reader like me, perhaps not tons to have fun with but, quality over quantity!\n\nThe art to put simply is \"creepy cute\", it uses colours and elements (Such as Sachi's comparatively detailed eye) which could put off some people, finding it too creepy, but at the same time it manages to make \"aww\" at how cute some of the CG / art can be. Really this is the deciding factor for if people will enjoy the game or not, i'd suggest looking up some of Ray-Kbys' art online, just... Be careful where you look kiddies XD deviantart should be dandy.\nIt's also got some animations here and there when progressing through chapters... They're nice :P\n\nThe music is... Meh. I'm not an expert of music myself, but yeah, it uses a MIDI sound board I believe and it's neither good or bad in my opinion... Two of the tracks I find fit two of the characters rather well, the chill one for Tomo and menacing one for Sadokawa, apart from those the music is okay, it's definitely not the center piece of this game though.\n\nI also read the after thoughts of the game and all I've got to say is, I hope Ray carries on making these sorts of games, even better ones, when he's ready himself of course. I would personally love to see a sequel or re-release/upgrade from this game with multiple path choices, mainly for more Sachi and to close off all the loose ends.\n\nIn total then, yeah, I really enjoyed what I bought. I really can't get enough of this sort of art style as well as the cuteness of Sachi and that one eye, i'd hang a picture of her on my wall anyday :D", "timestamp_created": 1432863157,

touching her scars it may be funny sometimes, the game could have done without that and would be much better, it would have been okay though out of curiosity first few times, another problem is though it is a little short and more things could have been added to it.

First i'd like to say that 'Eye' love this game!   This game is one of the sweetest, charming, cutest and heartwarming games ive played in along time.   The only complaint i have is that it's too short and that it's lacking polish in some parts of the story.  But other than that the game is amazing.   The characters are deep, well fleshed out, and very likeable.  Especially Sachi the cute uni-eyed heroine of the story.

Ignore the haters.\n\nHitomebore is a love story visual novel that, from my understanding, was made mostly by one person. Originally released last year at COMITIA 107, the Steam version comes with improved CGs and an English translation by Sekai Project. Hitomebore runs on Renpy, which is fairly uncommon for a Japanese production despite its status as the go-to visual novel framework in the West, so that's quite interesting.\n\nThe game's strongest point (by a considerable margin) is its creepy look. There is a short animated clip whenever the chapter changes. Unfortunately, like so many other visual novels, the game runs natively in a low, 4:3 resolution.\n\nMusic is MIDI-tier at times, but not unpleasant to listen to. I kind of like the main theme in fact, but it's not something I'd listen to outside of the game.\n\nStory is where it all falls apart, both in terms of length and writing quality. Without spoiling anything, let's just say that the game never takes full advantage of its fairly unique theme of having a girl with one eye. You could replace it with a different condition without having to rewrite much of the story, which by the way is high school drama that we all have seen a thousand times before. Highlights are the scene where the MC feeds Sachi, and the scenes where he touches her scars. You will be getting about 2-3 hours of story, which for its price tag is quite short.\n\nFor 10 bucks I can't recommend it due to its length and writing, but since Sachi is such a likeable character and the game is an indie product, I can't regret spending 10 bucks on it either.", "timestamp_created": 1432385351, "timestamp_updated": 1432385733, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 234, "votes_funny":

Surely there can't any room left in that head for a brain? Ah, whatever. The only thing more bizarre is her choice in clothes. A melon wrapped in pink meringue springs to mind.\nThe story is quite cute, but I found something slightly disturbing about it. It's a very typical Japanese anime relationship that develops very slowly and is really gentle. All good so far. It tries to deal with the issues of a person who doesn't conform to norms\u2026. but you get the idea that the female protagonist was made that way to appeal to the small number of males who find solace in the belief that if normal girls don't like them then maybe they can find an abnormal one that will.  Maybe I am being too harsh, but I have never really liked the overly demure female characters that seem fairly popular with Otakus. The novel goes so far to refer to the player as the protagonist at several points in the game, making it very clear who this game is aimed at.  \nIn short, I think this novel will appeal to a niche market. It is very well produced, the illustrations are just fine, and while some will find the story very cute, others will be perplexed by it.

I'll start with that. The game's story is nothing to write home about. It's a boring, standard, high-school romance. Now, sure, there's nothing wrong with a clich\u00e9d story, but if a story's going to be clich\u00e9, it needs to make up for it in some other area.\n\nOkay, so if the story's clich\u00e9, how about the characters? Well, they're just as two-dimensional as the story. The protagonist is a VN protagonist. He's 'nice,' kind of, and that is all there is to him. The cyclops girl, Sachi, is the shy one who doesn't have any friends. The supporting cast is comprised of the loud one and the cynical one. That's all I remember about them. The antagonist is 'the bully', who I'm convinced only exists to justify the writer ham-fisting his fetish for scars into the game. \n\nDid I mention that the author really likes scars? Because there are at least three different scenes in the game where the protagonist touches Sachi's scars. Each scene is written with the sort of lurid prose you see when you know that the writer is masturbating furiously to what they're writing.\n\nMoving away from the author's fetishes, let's talk about the soundtrack. It's even worse than the story. Every song is made using bad MIDI instruments that don't mesh well. The songs themselves have no sense of what constitutes a good melody or harmony, leaving a soundtrack that manages to almost be mediocre at its very best.\n\nThe art's interesting enough, it has a decent, sketch-like aesthetic, but I question if that's intentional or just a result of the fact that the game was made in the space of two months by a single guy.\n\nNow, length: The game is an hour and a half long. It's an appropriate length for what it is, but certainly not worth the ten dollars it's charging.\n\nAll in all, this game is really not very good and there are so many things better than this that you could be spending your money on. Hell, there are visual novels better (and longer) than this at the same price point or lower on Steam right now.\n\ntl;dr: If you really, [i]really[/i] like cyclops girls, amateurish storytelling, and scars, I won't stop you from buying this.

try my best lol\nI wouldn't call this a \"review\", but more of a \"my experience\"\n\n[b]**(Disclaimer if you are not knowledgeable of Visual Novels)**[/b]\nA VN, or Visual Novel, is exactly what it is. Like reading a book or short story on a tablet or your computer.\nSome give you the option to make decisions while others are simply telling a story. There are plenty of Visual Novels on other places besides Steam. Some good, bad, serious, funny, all-ages, and the more adult oriented ones.\nIf you'd like you can check out more here [url=https://vndb.org/]Visual Novel Database[/url]\n\n[b]I am still very very VERY new to the VN scene.[/b]\nI have a few more VN's stashed away for a rainy day, but my Japanese is at level 0\n\nAnyways\nThis isn't actually a review, but more of a \"my experience with this Visual Novel\"\n\n\n[b]So the overall Story[/b]:\n(I'll try to not to go into detail to spoil any of it. So I apologize if my review seems a bit blunt)\nThe story takes about 2 - 3 hours to complete and gets to the point rather quickly.\nAs most of you already know from the pictures on its Steam Store Page, it's about the girl with 1 eye.\n\n[b]The Writing[/b]:\nI wouldn't say it's the best, but I feel that it could have been worked on better.\nThe dialogue describes the characters couple that with the character design and you can easily make out which and what kind of personality a character has.\nI did get a few laughs from some of the dialogue though.\nThe Author himself said that he felt that he wished he had more time to work on the game before the deadline to turn his work in.\n\n[b]The Characters[/b]:\n(Sorry can't go into too much detail with this!)\nYou have the\nEmotionless\nHappy-Go-Lucky\nTimid/Shy\nThe Antagonist\nI really wish the Creator took more time to flesh out the Characters more. There are hints that provide what kind of past 1 or 2 characters have had, but as for the rest the Creator doesn't really go into detail about the others.\nThere seemed to be a lot of potential to give the characters a ton of background story. But I guess the Creator didn't have much time to do that with the deadline so close.\n\n[b]The Music[/b]\nThe music in a Visual Novel is supposed to set the tone for current events in the story.\nBut in this case it's a bit of a \"hit or miss\"\nSome of the music just doesn't seem to fit or could have been done better to better fit the mood to either tense it up or bring it back down. \nThere were some scenes that didn't need any music at all like some of the classroom scenes.\nAnd certain scenes that needed its own special music different from the usual ones that come up throughout the story.\n\n\n[b]FINAL THOUGHTS[/b]\nThe Story itself had a lot of potential to add a lot of things.\n[b]Like different endings, different routes, and maybe even more chapters[/b]\n\nIf the Creator had more time to flesh out the game more I'm sure he would have made something even more amazing. \nIf only he had more time.\n\n[b]***I really wish more Visual Novels would release on Steam\nAnd I really wish that people took the time to play through the VN and review it instead of leaving stupid comments like \"SO CUTE WOULD WAIFU AND FUG TO OBLIVION LOL\"\nI get sick of seeing people with less than an hour of playtime reviewing the game and giving it a review similar to that.\nPlease try to avoid being these kind of people.\nIt's an Anime related game on Steam. I get it, but at least try. \nIf you want a perfect example of what I'm talking about just look at some of the reviews for other VN's on Steam.***[/b]\n\nThey are trying to tell a story, but there are people that think it's a joke because they see a side-boob.", "timestamp_created": 1432071581, "timestamp_updated": 1432071881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552727", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15904339": {"recommendationid": "15904339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010307214", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451592654}, "language": "english", "review": "Literally the cutest, all other waifus are garbage.", "timestamp_created": 1432061235, "timestamp_updated": 1432061235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472326", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15902094": {"recommendationid": "15902094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088535919", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432053403}, "language": "english", "review": "Man, I'm a sucker for vanilla shit.

A pure, heart-warming romance game where the apple of your eye only has one eye![/quote]\n\n[h1]Handlung:[/h1]\n\nDie Handlung ist eigentlich eine recht typische Love Story, bis halt auf den Punkt, dass es sich bei der weiblichen Protagonistin mehr oder weniger um ein Monster Girl handelt. Bei der Geschichte sticht nichts besonders hervor und das meiste l\u00e4uft trotz diesem Umstand nach Schema F ab. In der Hinsicht gibt es hier keine gro\u00dfen \u00dcberraschungen. Auch der (recht kleine) Dramateil wird ohne gro\u00dfe Schwierigkeiten sehr schnell abgehandelt. Die Handlung ist zwar interessant, der Spannungsbogen wird aber recht flach gehalten. Trotzdem hat man aber Interesse hier am Ball zu bleiben und die Geschichte rund um Sachi und Mamoru weiter zu verfolgen. Hier wird definitiv nichts neues Erfunden, aber auf dem was in dem Genre sonst so Gang und gebe ist, wird solide aufgebaut.\n\nIch hatte zu beginn doch eher eine Handlung erwartet, welche mehr mit dem Thema Diskrimination rund um Sachi handeln wird. Dieses Thema wird allerdings nur am Rand angeschnitten und ist definitiv kein Hauptaugenmerk des Settings. Dies hat mich positiv \u00fcberrascht, da sich insgesamt die Handlung doch anders entwickelt hat, als es vorher f\u00fcr mich ersichtlich war.\n\nDa es sich hier um eine kinetische Visual Novel handelt, gibt es keine Entscheidungen zu treffen. Man beginnt einfach zu lesen und ehe man sich versieht, ist man auch schon am Ende angekommen. Als relativ schneller Leser war ich mit Hitomebore inklusive den Extras in unter zwei Stunden fertig.\n\n[h1]Illustrationen:[/h1]\n\nDie CGs und Illustrationen der Charaktere sind hier deutlich anders als in anderen Visual Novels, die ich bisher gelesen habe. Es unterscheidet sich hier doch stark von anderen Zeichenstilen. Das was man sonst so in Visual Novels zu sehen bekommt, wirkt vom Stil her hiergegen schon fast klinisch rein. Hitomebore hat einen Zeichenstil, bei dem sowohl die Hintergr\u00fcnde als auch die Charaktere gemalt wirken, wobei es ein eher grober Malstil ist. Ich finde nicht, dass dies mit irgendeiner anderen Visual Novel zu vergleichen ist. Hierbei muss man aber auch sagen, dass der Stil definitiv nicht f\u00fcr jeden etwas ist. Als jemand, der selbst kein Auge f\u00fcr Kunst hat, kann ich es aber auch nicht mit irgendetwas aus der Malerwelt vergleichen. Hier muss einfach jeder mal selbst ein Auge darauf werfen und entscheiden, ob man sich mit dem Stil anfreunden kann. Ich f\u00fcr meinen Teil habe mich zumindest mal darauf eingelassen und meiner Meinung nach passt es definitiv zu Hitomebore.\n\n[h1]Charaktere:[/h1]\n\nBei den Charakteren liegt der Fokus klar auf den beiden Protagonisten Mamoru und Sachi. Hinzu kommen noch zwei Freunde von Mamoru und nat\u00fcrlich eine Antagonistin. Auch wenn Hitomebore relativ kurz ist, wurden die Hauptcharaktere doch befriedigend entwickelt. Allerdings nur befriedigend, da man am Ende doch immer noch offene Fragen zu den Charakteren hat und man sich doch fragt, auf welcher Basis manche Entscheidungen der Charaktere getroffen werden. Gerade was die Hintergrundgeschichte von Sachi angeht, h\u00e4tte ich mir doch deutlich mehr gew\u00fcnscht. Dies zieht zwar das Charakterdesign nicht wirklich herunter, ein bisschen mehr w\u00e4re hier aber doch w\u00fcnschenswert gewesen. Was mir hier wohl ein wenig gefehlt hat, war bei der Produktion jemand mit einem Auge f\u00fcr Details, welcher die Charaktere noch etwas ausgeschm\u00fcckt h\u00e4tte. Bei den Nebencharakteren h\u00e4tte deutlich mehr Informationen gut getan. Diese sind vom Aufbau doch deutlich schw\u00e4cher als die Protagonisten. Hier h\u00e4tte ich mir sogar gew\u00fcnscht, dass es auch bei denen Charakterentwicklung, vielleicht sogar eine romantische Entwicklung gegeben h\u00e4tte. Rin, die Antagonistin, ist die Charakterin, die am schlechtesten erkl\u00e4rt wird. Hier brauchte man wohl einfach nur eine Gegenspielerin. Eine Substanz steckt allerdings nicht hinter ihr, was schade ist. Meiner Meinung nach sind in Hitomebore die Charaktere doch ein leichter Schwachpunkt. Dies ist etwas, was bei einer Visual Novel, deren Fokus auf den Charakteren liegt, nicht passieren sollte.\n\n[h1]Sound:[/h1]\n\nDer Sound ist f\u00fcr mich das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Manko. Es gibt in den Optionen zwei Schieberegler: Einen f\u00fcr Musik und einen f\u00fcr Soundeffekte. Obwohl es Schieberegler sind, funktionieren sie gef\u00fchlt doch wie Kippschalter. Entweder h\u00f6rt man gar nichts oder man bekommt das Trommelfell mal ordentlich durchgepustet. Ob dieses Problem \u00fcberall auftritt, kann ich nicht sagen, bei mir war es zumindest unter Mac OS der Fall. Warum es \u00fcberhaupt einen Schieberegler f\u00fcr Soundeffekte gibt, ist wieder so eine andere Sache. Gef\u00fchlt gibt es nur drei Soundeffekte in der ganzen Visual Novel. Das h\u00e4tte man dann auch komplett weglassen k\u00f6nnen.\n\nWas die Musik angeht, so konnte ich hier schon nach kurzer Zeit nichts anderes mehr, als mit den Augen zu rollen. Der Soundtrack hat mich einfach Wahnsinnig gemacht. Hier war ich dann doch froh \u00fcber den \u201cSchiebe-Kipp-Regler\u201d. Von der Musik bin ich einfach nur aggressiv geworden. Normalerweise soll Musik ja die Ereignisse der Novel unterst\u00fctzen, hier f\u00fchrte es aber dazu, dass ich einfach nur noch rot gesehen habe. Bei aller liebe, aber ich konnte mich absolut nicht mit der Musik anfreunden. Das ist dann aber auch mein gr\u00f6\u00dfter Kritikpunkt an Hitomebore.\n\n[h1]Fazit:[/h1]\n\nHitomebore ist vom Setting und von den Illustrationen definitiv mal etwas anderes, was sich doch in dem Bereich deutlich von anderen Titel abhebt. Leider wurde dann aber nicht das volle Potential genutzt und gerade bei den Charakteren sind doch Mankos zu sp\u00fcren. Nachdem ich die Musik ausgeschaltet hatte, machte Hitomebore doch durchaus Spa\u00df zu lesen. Da man mit der Visual Novel keine gr\u00f6\u00dfere zeitliche Verpflichtung eingeht, kann ich trotz der Schw\u00e4chen jedem mal empfehlen, einen Blick in Hitomebore zu werfen.\n\n[h1]7/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1432021606, "timestamp_updated": 1432021606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521381", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15896712": {"recommendationid": "15896712", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026884623", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432193098}, "language": "english", "review": "A short kinetic visual novel, Love at First Sight: Hitomebore is a solo project by the artist Ray-K. \nThe plot is a fairly standard high school love-story/drama with an unusual character; Usui Satsi (or Sachi, as this official release has localized her name as). The story is warm for the most part, and touches on typical subjects in high school that come with being an \"odd one out\".\n\nThat being said, there isn't a whole lot to get out of this read if you aren't already predisposed to a few things:\nA) Liking Ray-K's cute and macabre artwork.\nB) Finding cyclops girls to be the most precious thing in the world (who doesn't?).\nC) You don't have stupidly high expectations because you've actually read (or tried to read) more than just the popular, cream of the crop VNs (with even some of those not actually being that good).\n\nI'll be frank, $10 is a steep price for this short read. There's nothing new or unprecedented here, just a small solo project that's well put-together for the most part. Ray-K is responsible for everything except some of the music and of course, the Ren'py engine.\nHowever, as a fan of Ray-K's art and general curiosity after skipping through an untranslated demo he released a while back, I was pleasantly surprised to see it translated and released here. I didn't hesitate at all to purchase it.\nThe game actually includes some nice extras: character profiles, stages of development, and some bonus scenes, but some are left untranslated at the moment. Hopefully that will be changed in the future.\nThe creator, Ray-K, admits it wasn't ultimately near his original vision in an Afterword that's included, but is very satisfied he was able to make a game featuring his character, Usui Satsi.\n\nBut yeah, buy this game so you can learn to love cyclops girls if for some reason you already don't and earn some cute trading cards.", "timestamp_created": 1432021371, "timestamp_updated": 1432021371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.783083", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15896078": {"recommendationid": "15896078", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967599040", "num_games_owned": 6421, "num_reviews": 192, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434081817}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30b5\u30fc\u30af\u30ebFreakilyCharming\u306e\u30ce\u30d9\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300c\u3072\u3068\u76ee\u60da\u308c\u300dSteam\u7248\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3067\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u3053\u305d\u5dee\u7570\u306f\u306a\u3044\u304c\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30ca\u30eb\u7248\u3068\u9055\u3044\u7acb\u3061\u7d75\u3084\u80cc\u666f\u7d75\u304c\u63cf\u304d\u76f4\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u307f\u305f\u3044\u3002\n\u3068\u3042\u308b\u9ad8\u6821\u306b\u8ee2\u6821\u3057\u3066\u304d\u305f\u3070\u304b\u308a\u306e\u4e3b\u4eba\u516c\u300c\u798f\u6c38\u8b77\u300d\u304c\u3001\u5c4b\u4e0a\u306e\u767b\u308a\u968e\u6bb5\u3067\u51fa\u4f1a\u3063\u305f\u5358\u773c\u306e\u5973\u5b50\u9ad8\u751f\u300c\u81fc\u4e95\u5e78\u300d\u306b\u8208\u5473\u3092\u6301\u3061\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u898b\u305f\u76ee\u30fb\u540d\u524d\u901a\u308a\u306e\u4e00\u3064\u76ee\u30e9\u30d6\u306a\u4f5c\u54c1\u3002\n\u30dc\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0\u306f\u6570\u6642\u9593\u3067\u8aad\u307f\u7d42\u3048\u3089\u308c\u308b\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\n\n\n\u3061\u304f\u3057\u3087\u3046\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u3053\u3044\u3064\u3089\u3001\u9ad8\u6821\u751f\u30ab\u30c3\u30d7\u30eb\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a(\u6ce8\uff1a\u5b9f\u969b\u9ad8\u6821\u751f\u3068\u3044\u3046\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3067\u3059)\u30d9\u30bf\u30d9\u30bf\u306a\u604b\u611b\u3057\u304a\u3063\u3066\uff01\u3042\u30fc\u3093\u3068\u304b\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u304a\u5f01\u5f53\u98df\u3079\u3055\u305b\u305f\u308a\u3001\u624b\u3092\u3064\u306a\u3044\u3067\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u304a\u3063\u3066\u304b\u3089\u306b\uff01\uff01\uff01\u30c9\u30b8\u3063\u5b50\u3055\u3063\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3082\u304b\u308f\u3044\u3059\u304e\u308b\u305e\uff01\u3053\u3063\u6065\u305a\u304b\u3057\u3044\u4e8c\u4eba\u306e\u3084\u308a\u53d6\u308a\u898b\u3066\u3066\u3001\u304a\u3058\u3055\u3093\u7fa8\u307e\u3057\u304f\u306a\u3063\u3066\u304d\u305f\u304b\u3089\u3001\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3053\u3057\u4ffa\u3082\u5c4b\u4e0a\u306e\u767b\u308a\u968e\u6bb5\u3067\u5358\u773c\u306e\u5973\u306e\u5b50\u898b\u3064\u3051\u3066\u304d\u3066\u9752\u6625\u3092\u9001\u3063\u3066\u304f\u308b\uff01\uff08\u30c0\u30c3\uff09", "timestamp_created": 1432015895, "timestamp_updated": 1432081064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 95, "votes_funny": 56, "weighted_vote_score": "0.650137", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15895218": {"recommendationid": "15895218", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977092120", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432009751}, "language": "english", "review": "A cute, short story.

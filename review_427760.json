The game ran well and the graphics were fine (could have been clearer in some places). This is not a hard core horror game but more a investigative psych thriller. It does have some jump scare moments but that is not the highlight of the game. The fact that it has a story and flows to a conclusion would be the reason to like this title. Great job Wolf and Wood. I was skeptical of this but in the end I was very pleased. I am terrible at puzzle games but managed to make it through this. There is a walkthrough in the guide section so if you are not a puzzle person like me juse that to get through and enjoy the game. But gratefully the game gives you enough clues to help you move along. Most people shouldn't have a problem. The only thing I found a little annoying was holding the flashlights, blacklights and lighters. You have to keep your hand on the trigger or it will drop.

[b]It's roomscale perfection[/b], and one of the fisrt/best titles that 'scales' to your playspace. If yours is too small, you are allowed teleportation, but I did not try that, and if you have no room, get a bigger apartment. It's truly, certifiably, immersively scary. All the environments look great, it renders well. Of all the VR horror games, it surly is the most frightening, and suspenseful, and I am an advanced level 10 journeyman in Virtual Reality,  so I should know.

I seem to remember being butt hurt and regretting my purchase, but before long, I was taken. I was only able to play around 1-2 chapters per night before it was done, and that was a fun week. I didn't really pay attention to the story (something about a little boy), but I will next time. I only took a few trips to the websites to get a hint, and overall the puzzle-age is fine.\n\n25$ is a perfect price for this, and it is worth ever damn shekel. They added a bonus episode, too! Woo! That was like, last year. God damnit, it's been so long since I've played this game. I'm trying to forget about it so I can play it fresh, but I fear everything will come back to me.

Both have been a revelation, yet containing so many flaws ([i]Greenwater[/i] especially) that I struggle to give either of them a strong recommendation. Nevertheless, here I am recommending this game, and not just to reward the developers for taking a big risk in a new artistic medium.\n\nThis game's strongest and weakest points demonstrate what can be most challenging and most rewarding in virtual reality game design. First, room-scale VR can do horror like nothing else. Most horror movies and videogames bore me or even put me to sleep. But [i]Greenwater[/i] puts you in small, claustrophobic rooms roughly the same size as your physical play space. Unlike in [i]The Gallery[/i], there are no blurry far away objects or textures and no need for potentially immersion-breaking locomotion systems. Everything is right in front of you and within physical walking distance.\n\nThis also means that whatever is going to scare you, and you just [i]know[/i] something is coming, it's going to be very close, and running is impossible both in the real and the virtual world. There were some parts of the game where I had to just stop and come back to it later because the suspense was driving me as mad and paranoid as the character you play. I found out after this happened a few times that this only makes the game [i]more suspenseful[/i]; it's better to just keep pushing forward.\n\nThere are times when you need to move to a different room, and as long as the door is unlocked, you just press your trigger on the doorknob, and your virtual body fades out of one room and into the next. It's so simple, and works beautifully. Future VR game designers should take note of the techniques used here; mere level design could solve many of the locomotion questions that are still being asked about VR games.\n\nSecond, fear seems to make it easier to achieve presence, but wonky unrealistic physics destroys it, at least in games that aren't set in fantasy/scifi worlds. And this game's physics system is deeply awful. Even just picking things up, like the titular chair in a room, feels wrong and awkward the way it swings in your hand. When you pick up pills and put them in a mug, they sometimes fall through the mug. Drawers hardly ever shut perfectly, which is excruciating to me. It feels even wonkier than the buggy physics in Surgeon Simulator games.\n\nThis game is basically an elaborate escape-the-room, so having such broken physics occasionally feels like a deal-breaker when your progress depends on manipulation of objects. Perhaps this is good for some people, as it will add some comic relief to a game that would otherwise be so frighteningly suspenseful it would simply be unbearable. But I would rather not be shifting in and out of presence all the time.\n\nThe actual story and horror elements in the game are really rather shallow, depending almost entirely on the creepy setting, music (that always seems to be [i]judging[/i] you), lighting, and occasional psychotic visions than on interesting characters. But it all works really, really well in this game, because you are playing a psychotic character. You feel it from the moment the game starts, that your mind is unstable and your perception of the world is unreliable, and that you are always being watched and scrutinized by the mental instutition you're trapped in. In spite of the disastrous physics system, this has been one of the most immersive gaming experiences of my life.\n\n4/5", "timestamp_created": 1483221329, "timestamp_updated": 1483293636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28861711": {"recommendationid": "28861711", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032465447", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483262266}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow, I really enjoyed this game.

Lonbow in the Lab is pretty good but it gets very repititious fast and lacks any depth. \n\nI must say, it's the first time I've played any gaming or any system where everything just stinks.

There's no middle ground, i.e., for example 3 of 5 stars on here is equivelant to another Positive and normally someone could clearly see the game is just average at best or junk and yet got a positive review.  \n\nGood tactics but tactics like that don't last forever. \n\nThe Playstation VR although not that great either, but if I had to choose one over the other it would be the PS4. At least in it's infancy has had a few games that are very fun. Can't say that for this system. \n\nAnd I don't want to hear any shit from you teeny-bob dorks that cream their pants with all this mindless wave shooting platforms and other stuff.

The mundanity of these tasks only adds to the experience, because you quickly get a sense of comfort and believe that all you're trying to do is the innocent task of opening a lock, when all of a sudden your blood turns cold as you're confronted with the evil that surrounds you.\n\n10/10 - by far my highest recommendation for Vive horror titles", "timestamp_created": 1478772753, "timestamp_updated": 1478772753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500050", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26493481": {"recommendationid": "26493481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071847972", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478456139}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was AWESOME!

I don't think a horror game or movie has ever scared me as much as this game did.  As a 27 y/o adult, nothing really scares me (unless it is something dangerous with realistic consequences), but this game gave me genuine anxiety.  I've never had goosebumps so bad that all my hairs stood up until this game.  I screamed out loud several times playing this.  It only took me 2 hours to beat the game, but I don't regret buying it all as it provided a very immersive, emotional experience.  I was sometimes too scared to even start the game, but I was determined to complete it.  It does not rely on jump scares, it is much more genuine and the story itself is scary.  There are parts where I just froze and was too scared to move or do anything.  While I recommend this to most, I can't say it's for everyone.  The puzzles are challenging, and if you don't have patience, focus, attention to detail, and problem solving skills, then this is not for you.  My wife could not get past the first level because she got frustrated from not knowing what to do and would give up too easily.  You end up getting stuck in a room and if you don't figure out what to do you could get stuck there for a while.  You build a relationship with the room and you start to feel trapped, which for me added to the creepiness and immersion-level of the game.  As a gamer I enjoyed the challenge and the determination to continue paid off.  If you are a gamer who has the patience for puzzle games and wants to get scared, this game is for you.  If you want to scare your friends, I recommend beating the game yourself first so you have all the levels available, then just throwing them into a scary part of the game where they don't have a whole lot to have to figure out, and the scares start right away.  The game gets scarier the further you get so the beginning can be a little slow for people that struggle to solve the puzzles.

But A Chair in a Room takes that trope and throws it on its head. Masterfully done, the game uses ambiance and sound to provide a tense and suspenseful atmosphere, as well as to create a truly immersive experience. Turn the chaperone grid to developer (so it just shows the floor) and you have an experience you'll forget is a game!\n\nThe story is equally good, with a small but superbly done cast, solid voice acting, and some very convincing animation (I'm not sure if motion capture was used, but it doesn't matter, the result is very realistic).\n\nThe puzzles are not too hard, and the controls are pretty intuitive. I only had to look for help on solving two puzzles, and one of them was just how to operate a locking mechanism. Everything else I was able to figure out by logic or trial and error.\n\n[MINOR SPOILERS COMING]\n\nNow for the scares, because that's why we buy horror games. The scares are GOOD without being overdone or overtly cheap. There were only two moments where I actually screamed out loud, but they were masterfully done. If you scare easily, you will be creeped out by this game. If you don't scare easily, you'll still be tense while playing. That is the hallmark of good psychological horror--even the bravest people will feel the suspense. Now I did say that this game doesn't rely on jump scares, but it has one that will get you. I won't spoil where it is in the game, but it is completely appropriate given the context. Yes, it is one of the times I screamed out loud.\n\nMore on the story and how it's told... and this is the only sin the game commits. You have to be TOLD the real story at the end, which is drawn out a bit too long, instead of SHOWN the story throughout the game. I didn't like having to have things explained to me, I should have been able to put it together from the clues. I get why the creators did it, I just don't agree. But when you take in the entire game as a whole, this is quite forgivable.\n\n[SPOILERS DONE]\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of psychological horror or solid puzzle games, as either will be able to enjoy the experience.

If you get scared easily and are wondering if you can actually handle the game, without spoiling anything, I will say that there are some spooky moments that can really creep you out, but nothing that was far too scary for me to progress. \n\nThe story itself was pretty good and definitely didn't go where I thought it was going. The puzzles and such were all pretty cool and par for the course from other 'escape the room' games that I've played. There were none that I encountered that I couldn't find out on my own, though that's not to say I never used the built-in hand hint system and there were a few moments when it tool me a little over a couple minutes to figure out exactly what I was to do. \n\nI really liked how they gave instructions on using gear in the game. Putting the instructions in text on objects in the game was really, really cool. Borderline on a spoiler maybe, but I also really liked how they took full advantage over a player's looking direction. \n\nMy biggest issue with the game was with the play area, though it's not all the game's fault. I have small parts of my Chaperone area drawn in a way that includes parts of my couch and recliner, since they are so low to the ground, they have never gotten in the way of RPG or FPS style games. In this game though, there's a lot of reaching and grabbing that takes place low to the ground, and that made things problematic. Luckily, I was able to push down enough on cushions or squeeze between cushions to reach low places, so it never stopped me from beating the game, but it came very close to me having to pause the game, take my headset off, and moving my couch out of the room. My space isn't small, but I just wanted to get as much as I could. Despite that, and this is where I do fault the game, it placed a small number of things actually outside of my Chaperone space, but luckily this was just space above more couches, so I just leaned over the couches to access these places in-game, but some people may actually have a wall or something that they cannot get through or passed.\n\nSo, if you want to play this, it's not crazy scary but has some spooky moments, you better have a large area relative to what other games require, and if you have cheated your Chaperone space then you might want to make sure you haven't cheated it too much.  All in all, I really enjoyed the game and had fun getting spooked. Getting scared in VR is quite exciting and A Chair in a Room has only increased my anticipations of future horror games in VR. \n\n4/5", "timestamp_created": 1470459176, "timestamp_updated": 1470459176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471204", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24703445": {"recommendationid": "24703445", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995664657", "num_games_owned": 985, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474698523}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes.

(Partially correct, see my edit att the bottom!)\n* It has more variety than most other early VR titles... combined. That says more about other VR titles than this, though.\n* It's very immersive if you have the space for full VR room scale.\n\nREASONS TO AVOID:\n* If you have small space. I have 2.5x2.9 square meters and it's working great, but much smaller would probably not.\n* If you are impatient and don't like obscure far-fetched puzzles. This game has them. They are far fetched. Sometimes you just end up trying everything with everything. I'm a pretty clever dude and I almost gave up early on. \n* If money matters to you. As an indie title with low quality assets, it's really worth maybe 10 euros, not 20+. It's overpriced because it's VR, and VR makes everything look shiny.\n\nMinor annoyances that don't really matter:\n* Game physics could be better. Objects behave like they have no mass.\n* Loading screens could be smoother. Sometimes your \"hands\" disappear and you see default controllers while loading.\n\n-- Edit: August 7, 2016. After playing some more, I have this to add:\n\nAvoid this if you don't handle jump scares well and want to finish the game. At a certain point in the narrative the atmospheric sense of dread and tension becomes a predictable jump scare formula. To me, the whole point with fear in a game is that you can overcome it, force yourself to move forward. But that point is lost if you're certain that there's an unavoidable jump scare ahead. The game makes you look really hard at something and, predictably, startles you with a loud noise and something ugly out of nowhere right in your face.

It has taken thrillers and horror games to the next level times 10. Do you remember playing F.E.A.R. for the first time thinking \"THIS IS THE NEXT LEVEL\"? This game makes FEAR look like a joke. The polish on the atmosphere is insanely well done. So many times I had chills and heavy breathing because of the anticipation. \n\nThis game also serves well as a VR demo and party game. Hear me out on this. The beginning of the game is not that scary, it's just tense. It does a great job showing off the feeling of presence in VR. Secondly, if you have a bunch of friends around, it can make it easier to get through the really scary parts and also you guys can hot swap in when someone \"NOPE NOPE NOPE\"s out of the game. The game is only 3-5 hours long, so savor the moments and spread this game out over a few days. Yes there are some \"jump\" scares, but it's not the traditional jump scare you would think of. It's more like, you didn't expect something to be there. \n\nPROS:\n-very atmospheric\n-great voice acting\n-will scare even the people who don't normally get scared\n-works well for a VR demo and also as a party game\n\nCONS:\n-it'll ruin all other \"scary experiences\" as child's play compared to this\n-Some bugs are kind of annoying due to room sizing issues and puzzle bugs (i'll explain more below)\n-Floor calibration issues seemed particularly bad in this game, but didn't ruin the experience\n\nSUMMARY:\nIf you own the VIVE and can at least tolerate somewhat tense/scary situations, this game is a must. Nothing compares to it.\n\nBugs/issues I found:\n\nA few times the room scale and positioning was way off. I freshly calibrated the room in the Steam VR setup multiple times and it still forced us to spawn inside of walls or had to break past the chaperone boundaries in order to reach a critical point. Teleporting sometimes would break or turn off in the middle of a level and we were then stuck. The floor would often be off by a few inches. Nothing game breaking, but still frustrating that this game only seemed to have that issue compared to other VR games I played with on the same steam room setup.\n\nPuzzles were usually fine and fun, but occasional puzzles were frustratingly hard to do with the controls (the combo lock for example). \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1469476680, "timestamp_updated": 1469476680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24520241": {"recommendationid": "24520241", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960389498", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493226979}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes the physics are a little wonky, but that's easily forgiven.

I know it's become kind of in vogue to claim that a VR game isn't getting enough love, but this is one title that REALLY (in my opinion) needs to be in everyone's Steam library.\n\nWhile playing, I couldn't get over the persistent feeling that the game felt like it was breaking first ground for what room-scale horror is going to look like in the next five or ten years. \"I'll bet this is what people thought of Alone in the Dark,\" I thought to myself. And really, the comparison doesn't stop at the positives. AitD had an absolutely atrocious and clunky movement system, and everything felt like it was moving in slow-motion. Similarly, Chair in a Room's object-interaction system leaves a lot to be desired. It's very immersion-breaking to pick up a bucket with an object in it, only to watch that object clip through the bottom of the container and fall to the floor. I won't spoil things, but there's a scene in which you're required to use the Vive's trackpad to dial in the numbers on a combination lock. I'm not even sure how I ended up getting it open. Even with the numbers in hand, I had trouble controlling the precision of my selection.\n\nAnd yet, the game scared me to death, over and over again. I haven't been this terrified since playing the original \"F.E.A.R.\" on my college room mate's laptop back in 2005. Each and every scene is oozing with atmosphere and dread. And the jump scares are punctuated very effectively with the game's sound design.\n\nBy the end of Chair in a Room, I was scared to look at ANYTHING for fear that it would trigger another terrifying episode.

Also, try to get the 2.5 by 2.5 meter play space so that you don\u2019t have to rely on teleporting around. I did this halfway through the game by extending by chaperone boundaries on one side by 6 inches over my desk (there isn\u2019t any point where you\u2019re swinging your arms so no risk of damaging your controllers really). Also, turn off chaperone boundaries for a truly immersive experience (if you are at the 2.5 x 2.5 meter) since the game scales the rooms to be within these boundaries anyways.

Like many VR games it's rather short (I finished it in just above 3 hours) and quite expensive considering the short amount of time you're likely to spend with it (currently 22.99\u20ac). But considering the relatively small audience for room scale VR games at the moment, I guess the games come at a premium.\n\nBut if the price is not an issue, you get one of the most immersive and complete \"mature\" room-scale VR games available. The game will creep you out at points, and scary stuff in VR -is- another level than scary stuff on your PC monitor, so you must be able to handle it. The immersion is so effective, in some scenes my thumb was hovering over the steam-menu button as an \"emergency exit\" option, scared that something could happen that would really freak me out and fry my brain or something.  :D\nObviously this game is not for everybody, but if you are used to horror games, it's nothing really too bad.\n\nThe game has a nice variety of scenes and a satisfying ending. Sometimes it manages to be fun in a way that is not central to the game, as you can fool around with some of the more playful items in some of the scenes (building blocks!). \n\nThe one thing I didn't like so much is that it relies a bit too much on music and sound effects to put the player into a scary mood, especially towards the end. Of course music is a very effective means for this sort of thing, but towards the end I was getting a little tired of the usual sound cues (they were even starting to hurt my ears a bit, as there is a lot of \"beeping\"). I wish they would have made more with visuals instead of relying so much on the sound design.\n\nBut with the overall experience in mind, this is a minor complaint.

Luring you into it's depths with a bit of mystery, really grasping your full attention...And then right when you least expect it, pulls the rug out from under you and reminds you of the kind of heck you agreed to enter when you put the headset on.  \n\nMechanically, there are a number of relatively simple puzzles that mostly rely on logic and modest observation skills.  It's never particularly difficult, but does expect you to make note of your surroundings and check out things that might seem hidden at first.\n\nThe game makes brilliant use of roomscale environment. Recommended is 2.5x2.5m to play without any need for teleporting (I played with ~3.5x3m).  You simply walk around your room which the game environment is appropriately sized to match and give you freedom explore intuitively and incredibly immersively.

This world is dark, it is too real even if the \"grhafux\" aren't that good (Animations are just reduced to making objects slide or vibrate. ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0 )). It is too small for me to ever feel safe. This world is disturbing. And since it is VR, I'm in this world. The immersion is total, when everything goes right. My room was missing like 20cm to fit in for the game, so it was a struggle of learning how to open real world doors to reach for virtual pills to progress from virtual rooms to virtual rooms. I had to do the first half of the game like this, until they patched in a teleport mode. Though honestly the real room scale mode made me feel way more immersed and helpless into these unknown places. I've never felt that trapped before to be honest\n\n\nSo then first 10 minutes, I dive into the story. This is pretty cool, a murder, mental illness, a psychiatric yard, some doctors with a broom in the ass, flashbacks, some pills to trip with... It really sets in the character of the game, and helps you identify with him quickly. English being my 2nd language, I don't really grasp the story. But all I know is that I'm screwed in the brain and some pills make me go from room to room. These rooms vary a lot. Sometimes I'M ON A BOAT, sometimes in a corridor, sometimes in a cabin in the woods... These are neat. But all these rooms are dark enough to make you feel unsafe. Every noise, would it be the perfect placing of cue music to a simple clock ticking, makes you freak out.\n\n\nI spend the next hour trying to resolve the mysteries unfolding before me. It feels like a point and click game, and can become quite frustrating since it is so easy to miss objects that are key to progression. The grabbing of the objects can also be infuriating : I struggled for like 3 minutes on the first release version with the UV lamps just trying to turn it in my hand . But all in all, these puzzles are really designed in a refreshing way. And by refreshing, I mean that you drop a huge sigh of relief everytime you manage to put a key on a door, not because of the mentionned control problems, but because it took some good effort to grab that damn key in the first place. Satisfaction and fun. Overall, the progression isn't that hard, but I've had some friends getting stuck for 30 minutes in some rooms, because the clues the game gives you through notes on your hands were written in an English too hard to understand for some. Still, it doesn't hurt the enjoyment to much as you roll through the doors.\n\n\nAnd this is when the first \"jumpscare\" happens. I'm here in this corridor, and... I can't describe how much manlyness I lost in the process, screaming like a little child while trying to pass through the physical wall of my play area. This is scary. These moments aren't common, but when these happen, you are in for a treat. These are not Pewdiepie level jumpscares. These are smart. As if you were put in a dark room, and a mask slowly fades in view and approches you. A game that closely reproduces this level and sensation of fear would be Fatal Frame. This is so mentally challenging I had to pause the game at one point to take a breath and regain sanity.\n\n\nAfter 6 hours, I finished the game. The story was quite interesting, even though it is totally not as rich as a Silent Hill. But I'm glad I finally came out of this rollercoaster. Damn, what an experience, one of the best I've had in my life. And when I say this, it means it is better than sex. Not that sex gets me jumpscares... I mean, it depends on how the sex is done, and who it is done with... I mean... nevermind.\nDrugs are still better nonetheless.\n\nOverall : 9/10, not enough chairs", "timestamp_created": 1467128769, "timestamp_updated": 1467198909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473251", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23894855": {"recommendationid": "23894855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026465601", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467123661}, "language": "english", "review": "May or may not be based on a true story. \n\nAn experience that will puzzle you, not make much sence maybe?

Somebody in the Dev team who thought of this idea must be a genius. Not having to teleport through out the whole experience adds a lot to immersion. The way devs placed the game environment is just genius. They even added teleport support for ppl with smaller space. I think even if you have minimum VR space, you can probably enjoy the game with very little use of teleporting.\n-Beautiful graphics. The most realistic graphics on Vive so far. The Lab has good graphics but this one has the most Realistic graphics. None or very little annoying aliasing, thank god\n-Plot is actually well written(I don't know the ending yet but it is very engaging yet not too confusing)\n-Very good use of BGM and use of 3D sound effects.\n-No jump scare abuse that means nothing but horror.\nCons\n-Object clipping through sometimes\n-Physics is still not as good as how things are in the Lab but it is not horrible.\nBottom line\n-The Best full game on VIve so far.

A Chair in a Room, to me, all things considered (being 1st generation game and all) comes really close to these AAA titles I so much love. I believe A Chair in a Room truly is how horror games in VR should be implemented !\n\nPros: \n- Great scary ambiance !! (not relying on cheap-and-easy jump scares)\n- Nice general storyline that grabs your attention\n- Sounds and music\n- Creative and very good use of room scaling\n- Since the 1.1 update the mechanics are really good (thanks !!)\n\nImprovement ideas:\n- Story could be a little bit more refined (some scenes are a bit hard to make sense of in the general storyline)\n- Because every room is basically your room space, it's really nice to move up to the wall and open a door to get to another room. It'd be even nicer if, when you get to the other room, you have the door you just opened at your back (instead of being \"teleported\" in the other room and try to \"guess\" which door you actually came from). Now, I know that, reading this it doesn't make sense as in real life your wall remains there and you can't walk through it, but maybe in the \"loading\" moment when opening the door there could have a UI indication to pivot 180 degrees and then the room would be loaded in front of you (with the door in your back). (Hope that makes sense). I believe, after a couple doors, it'd become quite a reflex to pivot during loading.\n\nCons:\n- Loading times between some scenes are a little bit of an immersion breaker (minor!!)\n", "timestamp_created": 1466473234, "timestamp_updated": 1466473234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23672118": {"recommendationid": "23672118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164065886", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466440887}, "language": "english", "review": "Some reviews say this is a one hour story sit through so maybe the Vive experience is adding to that as I'm 5hours in with a few chapters left but really enjoying most of it so far.

I know from brief experience that horror games tend to have strong stories or emotional drive and I wanted to see the potential of this type of game going in with a completely fresh perspective. I felt that this title deserves a good word to try and interest as many people as possible.\n\nI think it's important to start with the outweighed negatives. This game has physics issues with interactible objects which can be disorientating at times. I also needed to use the locomotion system (beta build currently) to progress due to my smaller than required play area. In spite of these two \"immersion breaking\" factors, I felt completely involved in the surroundings and universe the developers created. A third factor would be the clue system, there have been two instances I have been frustrated enough with the time it has taken to solve a puzzle that I have felt it necessary to quit out of the game to find the answer. A secondary stronger clue system might be a solution, or just a tweak of the existing ones. I had issues in one scene in the first room and a second scene in the bathroom of the motel. Reading other reviews points out I am not the only person to have this experience, which is a shame. A linked downside to this is that I have had to replay sections up until the puzzle to get back to my progress. Some form of quick autosave would be appreciated for convenience.\n\nRoomscale horror is fantastic. VR allows for some truly unforgettable set pieces. The sound design is superb to go hand in hand with this. The soundtrack is great and it really fits with the environment. To be honest, I do notice bad textures and \"jaggies\" in games (including this), but this seriously makes you look around them out of pure fear and respect for the terrifying atmosphere. There was also some texture pop-in in the onrails sections, but this may be due to my GTX 970 being on the lower end of the performance scale. You quickly get over the videogame aspect and put your mind into the shoes of your character. I would put this title alongside other high presence games, namely The Gallery and Waltz of the Wizard. If I was more sadistic, I would actually demo this game to other people that didn't directly ask just for the sheer immersion factor. It's that good!\n\nWolf and Wood deserve huge credit for what I consider to be the most substantial and fulfilling title I've played so far on the Vive. The Gallery was magical, but this is brutal and unforgiving and will have a longer overall playtime for the money. At 3 hours in, I am still progressing through the game (chapter 4 for people that have completed it). I believe (and sincerely hope) I am about half way though based on the Polaroids on the start room door.\n\nI wanted to write this review when my initial impressions were still fresh. In spite of this, I would still recommend the game on the basis of value for money and strength of the experience. \"A Chair in a Room : Greenwater\" sets the bar high for future titles in my opinion. I have enjoyed the game enough to put it in my current \"must own\" list of games. If you do not typically enjoy horror games or are unsure you will enjoy this, I would suggest waiting for a sale as I do not recommend missing out.\n\nI cannot wait to see what else the developers have in store and I sincerely hope they continue in this avenue of development.", "timestamp_created": 1464997102, "timestamp_updated": 1464997102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23368485": {"recommendationid": "23368485", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992522670", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464988190}, "language": "english", "review": "I have to say, for the number of bugs I had while playing this should be an Early Access: Alpha game.

I didn't find it to be too scary, but I'm not easily scared. There were a couple moments that made me jump, and many more that I found rather creepy/spooky. This game does a great job at giving you a sense of presence. There is no teleportation mechanic and you need to actually walk to get to the different areas in the rooms. That being said you do need a larger play area (2.5 by 2.5m) however I was able to manage with a play area 2.1 by 2.4m but I also have a buffer zone that lets me go outside of my bounderies a good bit. Between rooms there is a type blank space that lets you reorient yourself for the next room. I found this to work very well and not break my imersion in any way. The game does a very good job at creating a tense atmosphere. It creates a sense of worry or panic in the player without needing the use of jump scares like other horror games. The story is pieced together very well through memories and flashbacks that keep you from understanding the whole thing until the end. \n\nThat being said, the physics in this game could definitely use some improvement. Items you pick up in the game often clip into things causing them to fall. In one instance I lost a flashlight which I needed because it bumped into a closet door while I was bending down to pick up another item causing me to have to restart the level. The items clip through each other at times causing things to occasionally spaz out. The hitboxes of these items are also a little off. I occasionally would grab the wrong item because something was sitting next to what I wanted to pick up. I found myself frustrated at a couple spots where I knew what I was supposed to do, but was unable to because of the physics. I always eventually got it to work and never quite got the point of rage quitting but I did get fairly close once or twice. Even though the physics can be frustrating, its by no means game breaking. \n\nPros\n- Great use of room scale\n- No need to teleport around (teleporting used in other vr games for movement is something I personally think needs to be improved on, I find it to be slightly game breaking)\n- No cheap horror scares, genuine sense of hopelessness and fear\n- Good story\n\nCons\n- Object physics\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this game. A majority of VR experiences are demos at the moment and this feels like a full game. It's a short game. It took me only around 3 hours to beat it but I'm sure it can be done much faster, even on a first run through. I spent a lot of time reading the signs and pamphlets in the game and I also didn't progress further until I was sure I saw everything there was to see in an area. Also I had to play two levels over because of physics issues. Realistically I would look to get about 2 to 2 1/2 hours of playtime out of it. I don't really see much replayablility out of it once you beat it once, but it would be good to demo to others who wanted to play a horror game.", "timestamp_created": 1464917343, "timestamp_updated": 1464917343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23343074": {"recommendationid": "23343074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027583013", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497317608}, "language": "english", "review": "I do not normally write reveiws but this game deserves a good one so here it is!\n\nThis game is pretty amazing so Im here to give the DEVs some props!

I'm a big horror fan and I knew with VR, these kinds of games would be great for it if done right. Well, I'm happy to say that this is one of the best out there so far for the Vive!\n\n   Pros - Great atmosphere and music. This is something a horror/suspense game needs and this one pulls it off! As for the scares, from what I played so far it does the job. I've been playing horror games for years now and never got scared or felt uneasy. This game made me jump and creeped me out. Great job! For the hell of it, I wanted to see how good of a job it does to make you feel like you're there in the world. I was very impressed with even the little things. When I was on a boat, I shifted my weight from one foot to the other, rocking back and forth. The boat actually moved like it would in real life. Bravo for the small details!\n\n   Cons - So far the only thing I can complain about is the object interaction. Holding items feels weird unless you go out of your way to manipulate them until they fit in your hand how they are supposed to be. Then you have items that fall into walls or floors. If that happens with a key item, you have to restart the chapter. The other thing is room scale. It tells you that you have to have a certain amount of space, which I'm sure is true. It warned me my room wasn't big enough, but I continued anyways since it was just slightly off from the recommened space. It still worked well!\n\n   With the small cons this game has, you must play this!

Let down by janky physics/interface and unsatisfying puzzles.  Still one of the best room scale horror games and worth the asking price.\n\n---\n\nLooks and sounds great, with some great creepy visuals and audio. Story doesn't pull any punches and there's a good element of psychological horror rather than just relying on jump scares, although there's some of those to enjoy too. \nUse of space in room scale is one of the best I've seen too. Rather than rely on a teleport mechanic, you move one room at a time. Between each section you're asked to position yourself so that there's always space to move. I think this works really well, and adds to the immersion as you always feel like your doing the moving around yourself, rather than by some  teleport magic. \n\nThe puzzle design is passable, if you can call them puzzles. None of them really require thought more than just banging together random objects. I found at least one of them to be annoyingly non sequitur.  It's a shame that there was nothing there that I really had to engage my brain for. \n\nMy biggest criticism is with the interface and physics. It really lets down the whole experience. Picking things up, which is arguable the most common thing you do, is awkward as hell. Even if you do manage to get a grip things can annoying just drop out of your hand for seemingly no reason. On more than one occasion the thing that was dropped dissapeared forever causing me to have to replay sections of the game to continue. This was excacerbated by the lack of any inventory system which meant the only way to carry the required items between rooms was in your hands. In general the physics feel seriously janky and really reduced the immersion for me. On the plus side, the physics on the underwater sections were really nice to play with.\n\nOn the whole, despite the problem with the physics, I very much enjoyed the game and can recommend it.

VR horror adds a level of debth thats impossible to achieve in any other medium ive experienced. If you are into horror games and you have a vive, do yourself a favor and pick this up.\n\nPros: \nAmazing atmosphere. Its actually scary.\nI dont think ive ever played a game that has made me so scared. Not because what happend was the most frightening ive ever seen, but because it definitely ranked in the top 10 scariest things I've ever physically experienced. Having you be the player, walking around, exploring leaves you so immersed, at times i forgot i was playing a game. I never thought to tear the headset off my face because I was standing there confronting these things and I knew it was hopeless and there was nothing i could do but let my fate unfold.\n\nGreat little touches that really immerse you in the game.\nThe post cards have smudge marks on them from being handled with someone with oily skin. Its only noticable if you hold a card under a light and angle it a particular way. Who thinks of that?! Also, there is a moment where a bright light is shined in your face. I instinctavely held my hand up to the light to shade my eyes and it worked. Little moments like that pulled me in completely and I totally lost myself in the game. The developer did an amazing job making you feel a particular using sights and sounds. I dont think ive ever been so present in a VR experience before.\n\nCons:\nHolding objects is a pain.\nObjects you can interact with come in two flavors, ones that you hold steady in your hand in the position you grabbed them in, and objects that kinda swing freely in your hand. I would say 95% of the objects in this game should have been the steady kind. Unfortunately, its only about half that you hold steady. This makes moving large objects very difficult, even if you use two hands. Two handed holding feels like you are grabbing two strings attached to the object and its free to spin and sway however it pleases. But even the static object holding was not optimal. If you pick something up off the floor, and try to look at it, you have to hold your controller awkwardly. Objects are held in the exact position you pick them up in. This works, but i think it would be greatly improved if they snapped to a default position in relation to the controllers orientation. That way you wouldnt need to keep picking things up and putting them down until you hold them in the optimal position for use. \n\nThere is some replay value, but not much. \nThis isnt really a con though and just kind of the nature of this expreience. I went back and replayed some portions of the game and the atmosphere stays, but if you know the solutions to puzzles and when some frightening scenes are, you can mostly get through the game unaffraid. That being said though, there were still some times when id forget something was about to happen and jump out of my skin =]", "timestamp_created": 1463521301, "timestamp_updated": 1463521301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23009487": {"recommendationid": "23009487", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996634235", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489346318}, "language": "english", "review": "Great storyline and atmosphere.\nIt feels like the first true full story based game on the vive.\n\nThe controls can be tricky (things get dropped if they touch walls/other objects) and sometimes scripted events don't seem to fire on queue.

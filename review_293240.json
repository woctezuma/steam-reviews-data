After a couple games, they last as long as you want them to (barring game crashes, which are uncommon in my experience.)\n    [*]Games are initially relaxing but there are several \"bad\" powerups to make them challenging such as taking double damage, receiving no healing, disabling weapon upgrades, and increasing enemy aggression\n    [*]Lots of upgrades, costumes, weapons, and powerups combined with randomized galaxies make for tons of replayability\n   [*]Scores are based on single games, not cumulative, and only log once you die, This can result in frustration if your life has gone on for hours and you've accumulated a high score in the millions and then the game crashes.\n   [*]Music is intermittent rather than looped- I've gone anywhere from 1-30 minutes without music. \n   [*]NPC's are tight-lipped and you'll find items that seemingly have no purpose. A dependency on guides is created but luckily there's a very comprehensive one on Steam.\n   [*]Achievements aren't difficult, just obscure or time-consuming. Game has SIX card drops due to the amount of cards required for a badge.\n  [*]ETA: If you crash, the only thing that's lost is your game score. You'll still keep the money, artifacts, and costume unlocks. \n\n[/list]\n\n\n\nIt's cute with a little quirk and deceptively addicting. I bought it on sale a couple years back and let it sit inactive until a couple days ago. It was a mistake to let it sit in my library for so long! I assumed my foray into this game would be a quick 1-2 hr dip but it ended up pulling marathons out of me.\n\nIt has me hooked with its replayability- due to the randomized galaxies, you can't start new games knowing where everything is and finding every powerup, costume, and weapon in one life is impossible unless your luck is crazy good. The dialogue is unique and cute without being obnoxiously twee.\n\nThe story isn't overwrought, it doesn't hijack the game by overloading you with scenes, decisions, or dialogue. Instead it takes a lighter hand and prods at you gently throughout your personal cosmic journey. You're aware of the history and the stakes but the game lets you goof off and explore. A boss is dropped on you at specific points, but if you know what points trigger a battle you can avoid them indefinitely.\n\nThat brings about a slight con- because of the minimalist dialogue and vagueness of hints, many aspects of the game are cases of Guide Dang It. In my first playthrough, I found an item that had no real info- it turns out it requires players to do two somewhat odd things with it to unlock a costume with a very useful ability. \n\nAlso, it could just be me but the steam overlay doesn't load with it and FRAPs doesn't respond to it either. This means no screenshots unless I go the old prt screen + MS Paint route. So I couldn't screenshot my progress during a very fruitful 7 hour run in which I unlocked many things and tripled my previous high school.

The classic arcade core with a botanical twist; the cartoony-cute art style; the tone-setting soundtrack that is memorable but unobtrusive, fun and sophisticated; the gentle humor balanced by some existential far-outness in story bits and easter eggs throughout the game\u2014each of these elements is full of personality and together they help to define each other and the game as a whole, making Cosmochoria a unique experience that\u2019s more than the sum of these parts.\n\nMost of the action involves you thrusting around from planet to planet Lunar-Landing-style, planting seeds and briefly nurturing plants while defending them from alien ambushes. When you succeed in healing that planet, you move on to another. Boss fights challenged me but weren\u2019t depressingly frustrating. For me the game delivers something between casual play and old-school arcade grinding, leaning more towards casual.\n\nI liked the designer\u2019s pacing choices. There are at least a few different satisfying endings and you probably won\u2019t find all the hidden artifacts before you beat the game a few times. Artifacts alter certain elements of the game and can be selected or deselected before every session. Apart from that, you also have a running total of little triangular bits (common finds as you fight through alien hordes) that you can use to purchase permanent upgrades for you character stats, weapons, etc.\n\nThe music is REALLY well done. All electronic and spacey, sometimes more ambient and other times more groovin, but in like an alien/cyborg kinda way. Perfect for cartoony space exploration.

not to recommend this game. In the end, I have to give a cautios recommendation.\n\nMain issue is in the core gameplay. It has rogue-like progression element to it, where each time you start a new game, you can buy persistent upgrades and jump past bosses. This means that you end up starting new game rather often (permadeath), and repeating same tasks (plant seeds, build base, kill enemies) over and over again. This means that gameplay may get rather repetitive and grindy, if you don't particularly enjoy the mechanics.

During this you are constantly harassed by annoying, but not dangerous enemies that teleport right on top of you. Enemies rocket at you from the otherside of the map giving you no opprotunity to dodge and forcing you to lose your powerups. They are easy to kill when you can fire at them, but often times the planets are too small to shoot them enemies from a distance. \nThe first three bosses are exactly the same. Pathing straight to you while shooting fire/ice/whatever so I have little hope that there is any variance later on.\nWeapons kill fast, but are uninteresting. Starting weapon shoots a single line of weak pellets, the next weapon shoots 3 lines of weak pellets, and the homing laser doesn't home to enemies.\nJetpack is difficult to control, very slow decelleration, but very fast acceleration. Have fun fly past planets as you try and land.\nThere is no distinction between planets, each one functions the same way. Some have lava or water, but they can be easily avoided and are often only an inch deep. There are different sizes, but that only means it takes longer to capture them. Captured planets heal you, but the larger ones that take longer to capture don't heal you more.\nOverall this game has an interesting idea, but the execution consists almost solely of grinding while fending off annoying enemies.", "timestamp_created": 1498942365, "timestamp_updated": 1498942365, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685799", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32833459": {"recommendationid": "32833459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195018449", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501453152}, "language": "english", "review": "best gam\n\nwill get drunk again\n\nnah jk but good gaim\n\nWAIT THAT MEAN GG\n\nAAAAAA NO", "timestamp_created": 1498516833, "timestamp_updated": 1498516833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.155721", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32830089": {"recommendationid": "32830089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034614210", "num_games_owned": 3227, "num_reviews": 151, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498504846}, "language": "koreana", "review": "[h1]\ud589\uc131\uc744 \ub5a0\ub3cc\uba70 \ud14c\ub77c\ud3ec\ubc0d\ud558\ub294 \uc288\ud130 \uc561\uc158 \uac8c\uc784[/h1]\n\n\ube44\uad50\uc801 \uc2ec\ud50c\ud55c \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c\n\uc8fd\uc5b4\uc788\ub294 \ud589\uc131\uc744 \ucc3e\uc544 \ub418\uc0b4\uc544 \ub0a0 \ub54c\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc2dd\ubb3c\uc744 \uc2ec\uace0\n\uadf8\uac83\uc744 \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub7ec \uc624\ub294 \uc801\ub4e4\uc744 \ubb3c\ub9ac\uce58\uba70\n\ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud589\uc131\uc744 \ub418\uc0b4\ub9b4 \ub54c\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc774\ub97c \ubc18\ubcf5\ud558\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uc8fc\uc778\uacf5\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud328\ud134\ub3c4 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c\ub370\n\uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uad11\uc120\ucd1d \uacf5\uaca9\uacfc \uc810\ud504 \ub531 \ub450\uac00\uc9c0 \ud589\ub3d9\ub9cc \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uba70\n\ud2b9\uc218\ud55c \uc7ac\ub8cc\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud574\uc57c\ub9cc \ud3ec\ud0d1 \ub4f1\uc758 \ubc29\uc5b4 \uc2dc\uc124\uc744 \uac74\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec\n\ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uacf5\uaca9\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\ucda9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uc5b8\ub4ef\ubcf4\uba74 \ucd5c\uadfc\uc5d0 \uc720\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ub85c\uadf8\ub77c\uc774\ud06c \uc561\uc158\ucc98\ub7fc \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc\n\ub2e8\uc21c\ud55c \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \uc810\uc810 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uac00 \ub192\uc544\uc9c0\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774\n\uc624\ud788\ub824 \uace0\uc804 \uc544\ucf00\uc774\ub4dc \uac8c\uc784\uc758 \ud615\ud0dc\uc5d0 \uac00\uae5d\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uadf8\ub7ec\ub2e4\ubcf4\ub2c8 \ucd5c\uadfc \ud2b8\ub80c\ub4dc\uc758 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uae30\ub300\ud558\uc2e0 \ubd84\uaed8\ub294\n\uaf64\ub098 \ub2e8\uc870\ub86d\uace0 \uc2ec\uc2ec\ud558\uac8c \ub290\uaef4\uc9c8 \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\uaca0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\ub9cc\uc740\n\ubc18\ub300\ub85c \uace0\uc804 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c\uc758 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc88b\uc544\ud558\uc2dc\ub294 \ubd84\uc774\ub77c\uba74\n\ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \ub9cc\uc871\ud558\uba70 \uc990\uae30\uc2e4 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uac83 \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uc644\uc804 \ud074\ub9ac\uc5b4\uae4c\uc9c0\ub294 \uaf64 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub3c4\uc804\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud560 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc0dd\uac01\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc\n\uac8c\uc784 \uc624\ubc84 \ub418\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \ud68d\ub4dd\ud55c \uc18c\uc9c0\uae08\uc744 \ub204\uc801\ud558\uc5ec \n\uce90\ub9ad\ud130\ub97c \uc131\uc7a5\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294\ub370 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\ub2c8\n\uadf8 \uad34\uc815\uc774 \uadf8\ub9ac \uc9c0\uacb9\uc9c0\ub9cc\uc740 \uc54a\uc744 \uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4\n", "timestamp_created": 1498509973, "timestamp_updated": 1498509973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32810473": {"recommendationid": "32810473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310487627", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498475324}, "language": "french", "review": "Je croyais que \u00e7a allait \u00eatre un jeu calme et facile \u00e0 jouer, mais notre bonhomme est une vraie savonette.

Si tratta di un curioso esperimento indie che, pur senza grandi pretese, riesce a fornire una piacevole alternativa a titoli pi\u00f9 convenzionali, forte di un gameplay semplice e immediato (bench\u00e9 alla lunga ripetitivo) e di una curva di difficolt\u00e0 ben bilanciata.\n\nNel gioco svestiremo i panni di un piccolo astronauta  - dico \"svestiremo\" perch\u00e9 ci troveremo nudi come mamma ci ha fatto - che vaga in uno spazio generato proceduralmente (come da dettami della filosofia roguelite), e popolato da pianeti inospitali e deserti: la nostra missione sar\u00e0 quella di rivitalizzare ciascun pianeta piantando semi sulla sua superficie, che germoglieranno e cresceranno fino a diventare piante. Maggiori le dimensioni del pianeta, maggiore sar\u00e0 la quantit\u00e0 di semi necessaria a riportarlo in vita: una volta terminato il nostro compito il pianeta si mostrer\u00e0 in tutto il suo rinnovato splendore floreale e ci restituir\u00e0 il favore garantendoci un effetto curativo limitato (direttamente proporzionale alla sua grandezza) e alcuni oggetti di varia utilit\u00e0.\n\nA complicare i nostri piani ci penseranno varie creature aliene, dalle quali verremo bersagliati con insistenza durante lo svolgimento del nostro compito di \"giardiniere\" astrale: per fronteggiare i nemici avremo in dotazione la nostra arma primaria (inizialmente molto scarsa) e tre tipi differenti di torrette da difesa. Le creature uccise dropperanno dei diamanti, che potremo utilizzare come valuta per acquistare potenziamenti permanenti di vario tipo, tra cui armi sempre pi\u00f9 letali e materiali necessari alla costruzione delle suddette torri. Tutti i potenziamenti (ma in particolare quelli dedicati al nostro arsenale offensivo) si riveleranno di primaria importanza soprattutto nei combattimenti contro i diversi Boss, che periodicamente si manifesteranno con l'intenzione di consegnarci all'oblio cosmico.\n\nUna volta sconfitto un boss questo ci consegner\u00e0 una pietra dimensionale, che funger\u00e0 da checkpoint e ci permetter\u00e0 di iniziare le nostre run successive da un punto pi\u00f9 avanzato della \"storia\". Mano a mano che progrediremo nella nostra avventura le ondate di nemici si faranno sempre pi\u00f9 frequenti e corpose, e sopraggiunger\u00e0 di tanto in tanto l'esigenza di battere una ritirata strategica verso pianeti gi\u00e0 esplorati per guadagnare tempo e medicare le nostre ferite. Il livello di difficolt\u00e0 in Cosmochoria, come evidenziato in apertura, \u00e8 abbastanza flessibile da permetterci di prendere confidenza con il gioco mantenendo un ritmo basso nelle fasi iniziali (simili ad un tutorial), pigiando sull'acceleratore in maniera graduale ma decisa solo in un secondo momento.\n\nPer quanto riguarda i controlli, Cosmochoria si presta ad essere giocata principalmente con tastiera e mouse, con quest'ultimo che garantisce una mira precisa nelle operazioni di attacco. Segnalo per\u00f2 che il gioco \u00e8 perfettamente fruibile con un pad standard, a patto di sviluppare una buona sensibilit\u00e0 e precisione nella mira con lo stick analogico secondario; per questioni di spazio e comodit\u00e0 ho sempre utilizzato il controller XBONE nei viaggi in treno, e devo dire che non ho trovato particolarmente scomoda questa impostazione, anzi. La fase di spostamento tra un pianeta e l'altro e l'impatto della forza di gravit\u00e0 sono implementati in maniera credibile, tant'\u00e8 che avremo pi\u00f9 di un grattacapo nel gestire velocit\u00e0, accelerazione e inerzia di movimento cercando al tempo stesso di evitare che il nostro omino finisca alla deriva nello spazio.\n\nDal punto di vista della grafica, la particolarit\u00e0 di Cosmochoria \u00e8 lo stile, che ricorda a tratti quello dei disegni per bambini. Ci troviamo infatti immersi in uno spazio a tinte pastello dove tutte le figure, dall'astronauta ai nemici alieni, sembrano uscire da un libro di fiabe per bimbi, o meglio ancora dalle pagine illustrate di un famoso romanzo di Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. Stile grafico a parte, ci\u00f2 che potrebbe influire negativamente sull'esperienza di gioco \u00e8 la pesantezza del motore grafico (forse di derivazione Flash o HTML5 - purtroppo non ho informazioni precise al riguardo) che va in affanno nei momenti pi\u00f9 caotici delle battaglie rallentando vistosamente. E' un problema riscontrabile in particolare su hardware un po' datati (come il mio maledetto portatile) e che ho avuto modo di notare anche nella prima release di The Binding of Isaac: in quel caso il successo riscosso permise di mettere in cantiere un remake (TBoI: Rebirth) molto pi\u00f9 snello e performante, cosa che dubito succeder\u00e0 con Cosmochoria per via del minor impatto in termini di vendite.\n\nLato audio le musiche sono quasi oniriche e creano un sottofondo gradevole e rilassante senza risultare troppo invasive. Gli effetti d'altro canto sono molto basilari e non particolarmente elaborati: \u00e8 un compromesso assolutamente accettabile, soprattutto visto il carattere fiabesco di Cosmochoria, che non toglie nulla alla qualit\u00e0 complessiva dell'esperienza sensoriale.\n\nIl mio giudizio su Cosmochoria \u00e8 senz'altro positivo. Se dovessi esprimerlo su una scala da 0 a 10 sarebbe un 7-, perch\u00e9 sul lungo periodo vengono purtroppo a mancare stimoli tali da permetterci di chiudere un occhio davanti alla ripetitivit\u00e0 del gameplay (sbarca su un pianeta -> pianta semi finch\u00e9 non rinasce -> ricomincia). Il gioco risulta comunque molto piacevole se preso in dosi ragionevolmente piccole, e lo stile grafico \"cute\" unito alla semplicit\u00e0 di approccio e al tono generale fiabesco potrebbe tutto sommato rendere Cosmochoria appetibile anche ad un target pi\u00f9 giovane.\n\n[i][b]Se questa recensione ti \u00e8 piaciuta clicca \"Segui\" sulla [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/retrogamingcafe/curation]pagina del Curatore[/url] del mio gruppo: sarai sempre aggiornato con i miei personali consigli e le recensioni dei migliori titoli indie/retro/roguelite in circolazione![/b][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1491322466, "timestamp_updated": 1498653345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549891", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30875822": {"recommendationid": "30875822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053788131", "num_games_owned": 5396, "num_reviews": 222, "playtime_forever": 906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512305809}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]OVERVIEW[/h1]\nCosmochoria is a science-fiction rogue-like game of exploration from indie developer Nate Schmold.\n\nIn Cosmochoria, you play a pants-less little pink guy in a space helmet, spawning on an unnamed planet in the middle of space. Your task is to plant flags to claim planets and grow plants on them, thus restoring them to vitality. As you claim planets, fight off aggressive aliens, meet NPCs, and find weird items, the game slowly reveals its story and your goals.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nGraphics are simple, but elegant. The game is two-dimensional, played from a side-on view, with colourful pixel graphics used throughout, and a unique stylised look.\n\nYour character is a chubby little naked person in a space helmet, and he (?) is almost as big as some planets. Planet appearance is variable, with planets ranging from those that look like the leftovers over some sort of nuclear war to some that bear ancient ruins reminiscent of Mayan civilisation. Even the larger planets are only an order of magnitude larger than the main character.\n\nThe camera keeps the character in the centre of the screen and, by default, rotates loosely around as you orbit planets (by running around their surface). It works well, although it takes some getting used to as you reorient yourself, especially when jetting off into space.\n\nSpecial effects are simple, but nicely done.\n\nThere are only very limited graphics options related to window mode and screen resolution.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nSound effects are good: well-normalised and used appropriately. The jetpack sound has a nice feel to it, and the pea shooter weapon sounds suitably weak.\n\nMusic is good, only occurring in certain situations, such as when a boss draws near. I haven't worked out what causes little bursts of background music in other situations, but the sporadic nature of them adds to the overall weirdness of the game.\n\nThere are no voices.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game is very easy to play, but hard to master. You have only five controls: move/rotate left and right, jump/jetpack, crouch/pick up/use, and shoot.\n\nWhen on a planet, gravity keeps you on the ground, so your most common actions become running around the planet either clockwise or anticlockwise, shooting enemies, and crouching to plant or build. Once you've restored a planet, you can leap in the air and use your jetpack to escape orbit, then navigate your way to another planet to start all over again.\n\nControl in space is fun, with your escape vector governing your path across the galaxy, and only limited fuel in your jetpack to correct it. Planets all have localised gravity fields, though, which helps to bring you back to ground when you find another one.\n\nMaking your job harder are a horde of nasty aliens of various types, who chase and shoot at you, and a 'boss' enemy that gets activated after every few planets that you restore. These become difficult fast, but keep at it and you'll soon learn some tricks to make defeating them easier.\n\nThe galaxy is procedurally generated each game, including planet placement and size, and NPC and artefact placement. The game includes three resources: seeds, bricks, and some sort of currency. Seeds are only collected and used in the current game. Bricks and currency are carried over to your next game when you die. Bricks can be collected and used to build towers and other structures on planets. Currency can be used to buy permanent upgrades in the shop before you start a new game. It's a good system. As you play not only do you start to understand and get better at the game, but your character also becomes more powerful and able to do what's required of him.\n\nThe game also has a strange collection of unique artefacts that can be collected. Deliver these to the correct NPCs and you end up with another artefact that allows you to change the universe in some way. Again, this is activated or deactivated before each game. Some are beneficial, like a NPC and boss detector, whereas others are downright dangerous, such as one that makes enemies more aggressive.\n\nUnfortunately, though, Cosmochoria either doesn't like new hardware and software (i7, GTX1070, 32 GB RAM, Windows 10), or it's become more buggy since its early days. I first played it about a year ago, then put it away until it was 'finished'. It's in full release now, and is much more fleshed out, but it also seems less stable. A few times an hour the game will just freeze for about 20 seconds, then resume again as if nothing happened; there's no stuttering or other performance-related issues, it just seems to decide to have a rest. I've also had occasional crashes to desktop, with the game giving no warning and no error, and just dropping back to Windows. This has invariably happened while I've been doing very well, too, so it's immensely frustrating.\n\n[h1]PROS AND CONS[/h1]\nPros:\n+ Creative universe and plot, with unique interactions and a good sense of humour\n+ Rogue-like aspects are well thought out\n+ Addictive and very replayable\n+ Pleasant pixel graphics used to great effect\n+ Nice music and sound\n+ Creative Steam Achievements\n\nCons:\n- Buggy: in-game freezing and occasional CTDs\n- No save system (which would be almost forgivable if it weren't for the CTDs)\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\nCosmochoria is a unique rogue-like game of space exploration. If you can appreciate solid design, good pixel graphics, and a sense of humour, then you should definitely take a look. It's just a shame about the crashing.\n\n[h1]7/10[/h1] (-1 for stability issues)", "timestamp_created": 1491051160, "timestamp_updated": 1491051204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670311", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30638448": {"recommendationid": "30638448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098607985", "num_games_owned": 430, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446489491}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know why people like this game.\nIs just awful. graphicly it is okay but i don't really like it\n\nIs seem to be a tower defense but most the tower seem useless.\nYou will have to take down enemies yourself.

Reading past this does have spoilers... so if you want to experience the exploration aspect of the game, I recommend not reading further..\n\nThere are definitely some other things to try exploring: There are story pods hidden throughout each play-through that give you some deeper clues to an over-arching storyline. There are a multitude of costumes and weapons and power-ups you can unlock that will grant you more power & make planting & surviving less of a chore. \n\nThere are also a lot more enemies you encounter as you get deepr into the game. 9+ bosses to beat and an actual end-game boss and end credits you can achieve.\n\nAmidst all that, and to really be able to 'get good' at the game, there are sort of 'secret mechanics' that you have to discover / unlock / strategize with that will help you become adept as a proper naked space traveller. These mechanics are never spelled out for you but become evident if you experiment with what things do and how best to utilize them. In a way, that aspect of the game was designed almost as a puzzle.. where you have the tools introduced via the UI and stuff, but its up to you to really unlock the best way to use them... but there definitely is an *intended* methodology. \n\n It IS possible to beat the game on your very first playthrough if you havent unlocked anything on the loadout screen yet, but the loadout screen store gives you a chance to pack the 'right' upgrades and items into your bag to ensure a super efficient space journey.\n\nEither way, I appreciate you checking it out, hope you had a couple fun hours with it.\n\nCheers,\nNate"}, "25130138": {"recommendationid": "25130138", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961217692", "num_games_owned": 1691, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439477835}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than no man's sky.

That too alone lost in the universe travelling through space starting with nothing but a gun, a seed, a jetpack and a helmet. Well if you did you should definitely get this game. But beware this game can take hours of your time without you even noticing it.\n\nCosmochoria is a cute little indie game which has relatively no rigidity of dimensions and thats exactly what makes this game so good in orientation. The story is not rigid as in you dont have to do a certain things to unlock certain levels. In other words you can play any ways you like and still get to the end result. The basic story being (as explained) you start off with a seed, a gun, a helmet and a jetpack. Your task being to save the galaxy one seed one planet at a time. There are interesting plot points every now and than as in they give clues to how the galaxy came to be the way you find it.But no rigidity in storyline.\n\nThe gameplay is superb, as in spontaneous, rapid, smooth and graphically nonperiodic. You have to infuse life into the galaxy and make life spawn again in the galaxy one seed at a time. In your path there are alien creatures, spaceships and bosses.They are tasked with stopping you. But dont be afraid. You get bonuses by killing them, like building points for healing towers , etc.One peculiar feature of the game being every time you die you can level up your gear if you have certain gems in your tally. (you collect them by killing aliens)\n\nThe game has smooth graphics, good music and neat storyline. All in all there are many positives about this game, which overshadow the negatives. A few being:-\n\nPROS-\n\n1.addictive gameplay\n2.Nonrigid storyline\n3.replayability\n4.easy on the pockets\n5.A very active dev\n\nCONS-\n\n1. Could get a bit boring as you play through, for you being the only player in the game\n2. no saves during the game\n\nAll in all the game is 7/10 for its nonrigid storyline.

You do unlock snippets of story as you revive more planets but it\u2019s never done in a \u2018do this\u2019 or \u2018follow this\u2019 kind of layout. The general story behind Cosmochoria is very simple yet very enjoyable. You\u2019re a little astronaut tasked with reviving planets which are dying out across the galaxy. Armed with nothing more than a jetpack, a single seed and a small gun it\u2019s up to you to save the galaxy before it\u2019s too late.\n\n[b]General Gameplay[/b]\nThe gameplay is simple, you start on a planet which will vary in size play from play and you must start by planting seeds which you\u2019ll only have one of at first. You must plant and tend to your seed whilst defending yourself from the various enemies you\u2019ll run into with your aforementioned peashooter. Once your seed reaches full sproutyness it\u2019ll give you more seeds and heal that planet a little. After you\u2019ve planted enough seeds the planet will be fully healed and you\u2019ll be rewarded with a chest which can have many things inside ranging from building blocks to random items or snippets or information and tips. Since there is nothing forcing you to leave the planet you are welcome to stay and keep planting there but you\u2019re better off using your jetpack to fly off and find another planet to save.\nEach planet has it\u2019s own center of gravity and once you leave you\u2019ll be floating through space using your (limited) jetpack fuel to guide you around. If you decide to fly right out of the edge of the map you WILL die so don't try it like I did. As you\u2019re travelling through spaces you\u2019ll can come across \u2018glitches\u2019 which teleport you elsewhere on the map which can be fantastic or really, really awful so use them which caution. \nThe enemies you encounter start fairly simple but as you progress and heal more planets you\u2019ll find harder enemies. When you kill anything it\u2019ll drop crystals which you\u2019re able to level up yourself with once you die and the bigger the enemy and harder, the more crystals they drop. Bosses will spawn periodically when you heal a certain amount of planets and they are a lot bigger and stronger. It\u2019s usually wise to have a small base on a planet by then to avoid being obliterated right away since bosses can seek you out from anywhere they are. You\u2019re not alone when it comes to killing enemies and defending yourself though! You\u2019ll earn something called \u2018building blocks\u2019 which allow you to build various towers on the planets you land on which can range from turrets to healing towers. Building blocks do not seem to be massively common and have to be bought with crystals if you can't find any and run out so spend them wisely.\nSince you cannot level up during a run you\u2019ll find yourself dying a bit at first until you manage to get some crystals and get a bit stronger but once you get the hang of it you\u2019ll be able to survive a fair amount of time each time but at first it can feel a little bit grindy. Since you\u2019re able to choose what you spend your crystals on in which order though you can quickly progress the way you want choosing to prioritize health over speed if you\u2019re dying a lot or focusing on jetpack fuel if you find yourself running a little low. \nThe further you progress and the more planets you heal will allow you to start further in the game each time so you are not constantly having to beat the same bosses over and over. Planets are randomly generated each playthrough so nothing is quite the same and there is plenty for you to explore ranging from NPCs, random backstory snippets and giant bosses so it never feels boring and has high replayability.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n--- Addictive gameplay\n--- A level-your-own-way system.\n--- Randomized world each time for extra replayability.\n--- Great graphics with accompanying soundtrack.\n--- Wide range of weapons, planets and enemies.\n--- Very friendly and active dev who is quick to solve any issues.\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n--- Can feel a little grindy.\n--- Gets a little repetitive after a while.\n--- No saving during runs: if you exit you have to start over.\n\n[b]Summary[/b]\nI got Cosmochoria in a bundle and this game alone is well worth the price of the bundle itself. Hours and hours of relaxing gameplay paired with cute graphics and a brilliant little soundtrack makes Cosmochoria a fantastic purchase and a game well worth checking out. Though a little hard at first the game eases up a lot and becomes a very enjoyable and time-consuming game.

Once you figure out how to play and what you are doing, things get easier.  It is still very repetitive.

It is invaluable since this game does not have and auto-mapping feature.\n-- Once you have the map, use it to aim when travelling between planets.  That way you are not floating aimlessly between planets.  It will cut down on your travel time and give you more time for collecting resources.\n-- Use the Easter Island monoliths.  After you build up 20+ seeds, build one on each planet as you start to tarraform it.  It helps a lot with the creeps that constantly spawn.\n-- When you find the portals, use them in boss fights.  They are especially usefull against the space dragons.  It will let you instantly get way from them.  When they find you again, shoot them as much as you can, then portal away again.\n-- While you are using the portals, build pyramids on your portal planets to reinforce them.", "timestamp_created": 1456411467, "timestamp_updated": 1456411467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21386753": {"recommendationid": "21386753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117155501", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500215446}, "language": "english", "review": "you can be a panda with a ninja sword. this game is so asian.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1456151816, "timestamp_updated": 1456151816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477099", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21383461": {"recommendationid": "21383461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117001089", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493832760}, "language": "french", "review": "Cosmochoria est terriblement prenant, mignon et relaxant.\nChaque \" game \" apporte quelque chose de nouveau et donne envie d'en voir toujours plus.

The art style is very bright, colorful and generally happy. (When you're not in the depths of outer space, that is.) Every planet is unique, with its own size, background objects, and possibly water or lava. Each time you play the game you get a randomly generated map, so you\u2019re always exploring new space. The problem is, you\u2019re exploring new SPACE. All of outer space looks just about the same, so unless you have planets evenly spaced, it can get boring. Also, there are some NPCs who, when you talk to them, activate a conversation loop that you can only escape by pausing and killing yourself. The two bosses I managed to fight (before conversation loops) were the exact same; one was big and red, the other small and blue, both of them fire-breathing worms. Another glitch I found while playing is that occasionally, the map won\u2019t show where your planets are, which made navigation a pain.

Don't buy this game on sale, pay full price instead because for once forget about money and other things that cause stress in your life and allow this little hooker to bring you one last true feeling of joy and satisfaction before you lock yourself in your car with a hose redirecting the exhaust into the cabin. Weirdly specific? Don't turn around, but I'm standing right behind you.\n\nCosmochoria (I pronounce it out loud a few different ways every time I read it, koz-moke-reeah, kosmo-koreeah, koss-mok-whoreeah, koz-mo-fuggiteeah) is a wonderfully delightful little game. Most of the game is unexplained and as you play, you discover the quaint fun of jumping, flying, and silly jokes about assgas that you suddenly realize is alarmingly absent from anything you've played lately. You'll lose a huge chunk of time mercilessly extinguishing the lives of an alien horde who were probably just trying to provide for a family they were pressured into raising by social conditioning they never thought to question until it was too late. There's also fun to be found uncovering or learning how everything works and unlocking items that alter the game mechanics. Go ahead though, don't find out on your own, look all the stuff up; you're an iconoclast or at least consider yourself one and really like the nice feeling you reward yourself with believing that to be true.  Why not set yourself up for dissatisfaction? You do it in many other aspects of your life. Weirdly specific? That's because your own desire is the cause of your suffering, as desire is the root cause of all suffering.\n\nAfter carefully considering exactly how far never really taking the advice of others seriously has gotten you in life, should you decide to ignore caution and engage in the ego-driven, hedonistic pleasures in life as I have, and you purchase and play this game, I have one bit of advice: Don't bother tearing your hair our trying to figure out where to buy upgrades, you'll go bald. You have to first play the game and then die in order to access this screen. I spent five hours on my first play without dying and let me tell you I was practically screeching like a banshee after visiting every planet three times without finding a vendor. The loading screen tip I was given was \"Buy a new weapon right away. Seriously. What are you waiting for?\" My inner monologue became narrated by the Earl of Lemongrab, just a long, high-pitched wail of how unexemplorable (wait, is that it?) this experience was, and it was then that I struggled to recall who it had been narrated by previously. Was it me, I wondered? Why do I talk to myself in my head at all? Weirdly specific? Why do you talk to yourself in your head anyway?\n\nIf you read this, honestly ask yourself what you actually get from reading reviews subjective to another's experiences? The experience of consciousness, you know the feeling of being in driver's seat of your own little meat bag, the same feeling responsible for the illusion of \"free will\", this experience is entirely subjective. The experience of consciousness seems to universally fool people into thinking they are in charge over the course of events in their lives rather than being  instinctive, highly reactionary creatures, who's decisions are entirely based on that subjective experience; an experience that yields a range of reaction based on cultural programming, brain chemistry, and genetically predisposed personality traits. Maybe it's possible to read a review written by a family member whom you understand very well and can somewhat accurately apply the same context to their phrasing, but a person who has lived a substantially different life from you will apply entirely different context to the same phrasing. In order to effectively transplant an idea from another's mind to yours without erroneously interpreting their true meaning, you must have established a common framework of knowledge and understand without assumption what context they may be applying. \n\nBut hey, you don't buy any of that... do you? You believe in free will. You believe you can alter your circumstances through rational decision making. Somehow, you are unencumbered by the emotional biases built up in others that accumulate over a lifetime. Somehow, you are not impaired by the impressive array of illogical heuristics that rob others of neutral observance, perceiving without judging, and feeling/thinking without attachment. Okay great, do something that betrays a typically conditioned response.  Do something for someone else completely selflessly without the self-driven motivator of being able to feel good about your altruistic behaviour; buy the game at full price rather than wishlisting it and buying it on sale. Oh, and please, start clicking \"no\" next to \"Did you find this review helpful?\" when the review is absolutely useless without the missing context found only in another's subjective experience. Maybe then we can actually use the reviews to inform our opinions on whether to purchase, rather than using this space for jokes phrased like 4chan greentext posts, with the same unoriginal ending, time and time again, \"10/10 would <do slightly quirky thing in game> again\".", "timestamp_created": 1454858900, "timestamp_updated": 1454858900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502520", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20959603": {"recommendationid": "20959603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258797779", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453427631}, "language": "english", "review": "fun if bored", "timestamp_created": 1454633163, "timestamp_updated": 1454633163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20903289": {"recommendationid": "20903289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190884671", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460759117}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El primer juego que compre en Steam y puedo asegurar que fue muy buena eleccion, me apasione por el juego, es muy divertido y puede darte muchas horas de diversion.", "timestamp_created": 1454372179, "timestamp_updated": 1454372179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20809167": {"recommendationid": "20809167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095863805", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495884368}, "language": "french", "review": "Haaa, Ce jeu...\nC'est sans doute le jeu sur steam qui a le meilleur rapport qualit\u00e9/prix.\nC'est sans doute le jeu avec le plus de rejouabilit\u00e9 au monde, bref il est top.\n\nLes fans de S-f s'\u00e9tant essay\u00e9s \u00e0 rogue legacy trouverons leur plaisir dans cepetit jeu vraiment agr\u00e9able :)", "timestamp_created": 1454004347, "timestamp_updated": 1454004347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20778461": {"recommendationid": "20778461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207087209", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478587422}, "language": "english", "review": "when i finished the game and replayed it with the ultimate suit, it felt like I was Neo that mastered the matrix .", "timestamp_created": 1453862653, "timestamp_updated": 1453862653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20735906": {"recommendationid": "20735906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137331535", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451789753}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun when you're bored, great music and art style but a bit expensive\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1453673663, "timestamp_updated": 1453673663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20710792": {"recommendationid": "20710792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031954550", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453584051}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a very original idea (healing planets by planting seeds on them), nice graphics and music, and a very enjoyable exploration side.\nSadly, the gameplay is not good, so the game manages to be frustrating without being difficult - most of the time I'm just ignoring enemies (and ignoring being hit) because destroying the enemies is boring and pointless.

Some be gotten evil has destroyed the galaxy and rid it of life. Your task is to hover over to each planet and plant seeds to restore life on said planets while at the same time fending off invaders and monsters.\n\nThe monsters start of simple and easy to deal with but increase in difficulty and variety as time progresses (Or as your save more planets, im not particularly sure). Every now and then, a boss has a chance of spawning in an attempt to ruin you for good.\n\nThe area you will be playing in is widely blank (It's space lol) save for a few planets here and there, big and small, which you will need to roam around to find, inhabit and restore. While it seems simple, floating in space combined with limitted jetpack fuel actually makes roaming space more lethal than it sounds since you would have to ration your fuel so you are not caught floating in space on an empty backpack towards the edge of the galaxy (Which causes death if that isnt obvious enough)\n\nThere are collectibles and artifacts that you can gather and send to the \"Wise one\" to be examined (Which is basically a way of cashing in your found items to be used in your next playthrough or identifying what it does). Permanent Stat and character upgrades are also available with currency you collect while playing the game which improves your chance of survival each time you traverse the abyss. There's also artifacts in the game which you can activate to change the base game mode either making it easier (Enemies spawn less/do less damage) or harder (Less Jetpack fuel). Top that off with procedurally generated map layouts to the game and you've got yourself a good replay value game.\n\nOverall, the game is completely worth getting and trying out. For the price tag they put on the game (23RM for me), I would say it is actually a pretty good deal considering how well fleshed out the game is. A discounted price is like taking Bacon and Eggs and adding MORE BACON AND EGGS.\n\nEdit: I seem to have forgotten one other thing. Im fairly certain it's obvious enough but the game has a strong childish and cartoon like art style which some might like or not. Personally it gave it a more innocent and simple atmosphere. The game would look more serious and action oriented if it was painted in another way. Like imagine Risk of Rain's explosion, art and chaos in this game. Pretty sure it'd probably be less about saving planets and more about destroying them.

But there are also animals/enemies attacking you, lots of them. When you planted enough seeds, the planet is filled with love! :D So you go on to the next one. The orange/red thingies that the enemies drop when you kill them, makes it possible to buy updates when starting a new game. You keep previous upgrades and also orange/red thingies. You don't keep the planets and other stuff you found. When you die, you have to search for planets and make planets happy again.\nI myself was sometime not even trying to plant seeds, because I had the feeling that at that moment, killing enemies was  better at that point, because it would give me more orange/red thingies to buy updates.\nYou could also look on your map, to see where you are. Beware that outside the map, you will die. Also, when you're out of fuel, it's not possible to move anymore (you have to wait some time before it recharges). So it's best to only use fuel to change directions, that means you fly very slow, but, who cares? :)\nThere are also things you find on planets, that you could deliver on another planet. I find this hard, because I was never able to discover all planets in one game. So.. It's hard to get the planet where you get something you have to deliver, and the planet where you have to deliver it, at the same time.. But still liking it.\nYou have to find out yourself how everything works. At the moment, I have 4,4 hours played. But I still don't know what everything is. Especially the messages you see on some planets. But I'm gonna discover more and it will be fun!\nAlso, I defeated one boss, but I'm not able to defeat the second, that would be hard to find out how to do that, too. It's so powerful! Haha, but I'll get there, I hope.\n\nI totally recommend this super cute game! <3", "timestamp_created": 1447238786, "timestamp_updated": 1447238786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499807", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18925463": {"recommendationid": "18925463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098845114", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446284244}, "language": "english", "review": "cutie game ever!!! pew pew :D", "timestamp_created": 1446885630, "timestamp_updated": 1446885630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526642", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18867561": {"recommendationid": "18867561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013059148", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479475989}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u6614\u3000\u30bb\u30b7\u30eb\u30fb\u30ed\u30fc\u30ba\u3063\u3066\u5974\u304c\u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3088\n\u7a7a\u306b\u6d6e\u304b\u3076\u661f\u3005\u306b\u3082\u690d\u6c11\u5730\u4f5c\u308a\u305f\u3044\u3063\u3066\n\n\u3063\u3066\u30bf\u30ef\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30d5\u30a7\u30f3\u30b9", "timestamp_created": 1446605622, "timestamp_updated": 1446605622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459290", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18836781": {"recommendationid": "18836781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040595440", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456918976}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "gostei muito desse jogo", "timestamp_created": 1446469167, "timestamp_updated": 1446469167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18829841": {"recommendationid": "18829841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003013824", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447498697}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a pretty charming game.

astronaut trying to revive a dying galaxy by planting seeds on small-scaled planets\nDifficulty: 5/10 (normal playthrough), 8/10 (going for achievements and how to figure them out)\nLength: 5 minutes to 2 hours for a single stint, 5-7 hours for a campaign playthrough, up to 15 for getting all rewards\nMode: singleplayer campaign\n\n\nThe positive aspects:\n\n- fresh and funny gameplay. The player travels through a galaxy of 50 planets, planting seeds, crafting defence towers and shields, battling bosses and probably saves the galaxy by beating the so-called cataclysm \n- a variety of powerups and perks. In every stint you do you will gain credits which you can invest in powerups and perks before starting another one. Those will permanently boost your abilities and thus make it easier to progress further. Very motivating!\n- neat cartoonish graphics and funny dialogues\n- Over 20 \"artifacts\" (to be randomly found in chests that pop up as rewards for revived planets) to twist gameplay mechanics in either a positive or a negative way, such as half/double damage, no planet healing, fast planting etc. \n\n\nThe negative aspects:\n\n- rather short, repitive gameplay \n- simple story (galaxy is dying - please help!)\n- lack of content: galaxies are basically the same - not much variation; towers don't have upgrades; boss fights don't require special tactics most of the time\n\n\n\nResult (and summary for those who have no time reading):\n\nWhat a great and cute game cosmochoria is! Saving the galaxy and unlocking perks several times will make you spend hours ingame. If only there was more content, like additional galaxies, upgradable towers and more challenging boss fights! But hey, its an indie game and it does a great job - hopefully there will be a sequel one day!\n\nDefinitely worth the buy!", "timestamp_created": 1445788308, "timestamp_updated": 1445865815,

universe aka a videogame they are living inside, and the thing that destroyed them was sent by the programmer to wipe their existence and start the universe fresh, only they created a stone which allowed them to bend the video game code to their will, but just as they were finished creating it, they were destroyed, though they knew they would be destroyed so they imprinted their knowledge of the stone and their history onto a child's DNA and tweaked his biology to allow him to live forever in order to one day explain this catastrophe to an adventurer capable of navigating the cosmos and avoid the great cataclysm from reappearing and destroying everything once and for all!!\"[/spoiler]\n\nTHanks again tho. :) Hopeefully with further updates to the game it will address some of those negatives you brought up! <3"}, "18660923": {"recommendationid": "18660923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098400345", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 702,

This game isn't easy to master. At every turn, it is designed to throw a curve ball your way. As of writing this, I've sunk almost five hours into it and not gotten bored at all. There are many things to unlock, many things to explore, and many tasks to complete. I would be willing to bet I could sink another ten hours into it, easily. For a game I spent $3 on during a steam sale? I'll take it. Hell, I'll throw my money at it.\n\nI'll summarize with this: is Cosmochoria going to win the 'OMG BEST GAME EVER!!! STOP MAKING VIDEO GAMES, THIS IS IT, WE'RE DONE\" award? No, probably not. But are you going to have a ton of fun while playing it? Yes. Easily.

Permadeath, unlockables that can be used over multiple playthroughs, procedurally generated maps, etc.. However, unlike most rogue-likes, the difficulty comes mostly from personal choice. You can unlock artifacts by finding them in the game and having them identified. Half of the artifacts will decrease the difficulty in some way, like, for example, giving you the ability to instantly plant seeds, which is how you heal planets, or have less monsters on screen. The other half will increase your difficulty, like not allowing turrets, or no healing, which will essentially turn the game into a survival. \n\nThe story is a nice addition, though not necessary to enjoy the game, and completely optional. You can learn about how the world came to an end by randomly generated messages on planets. The main issue I had with it is that there's a lot of nonsense in between the messages themselves, and while it does actually fit in to the story, it makes it a bit confusing to cope.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, you'll find yourself dying a few times at the beginning. The game has an upgrade/unlock system that you can only access when starting a game. There's a decent weapon variety once you have the currency to unlock it, and there's some costumes you can unlock in game for that added variety, all with their unique benefits.\nYou might find that a session, once you get used to the combat and pace of the game, takes a long time. A run from start to finish would take 1-3 hours, which is why the game has a milestone system, which will place you after the defeat of each of the bosses.\n\nAll in all the game is a good bit of fun.

It's also hard to describe exactly what *type* of game Cosmochoria is.  I hesitate to call it a platformer or a shooter, though both of those are well represented in its design.  I suppose the best thing to do is watch some gameplay videos and see if it's to your liking.  Personally, I've found it strangely addictive.  It has a very charming and very colorful art style, and the background music is quite nice, as well.\n\nThe author means it when he says that it is a game of exploration because that includes many of the mechanics as well.  There are ample hints dropped in-game, like what to do with the strange objects you sometimes find, so do pay attention.  One object in the game, the Moai statue, took me until just recently to learn just what it does, and that is only because the game now hints/tells you.  I bought Cosmochoria some time ago on Humble Bundle and the earlier builds gave no clue (that I could find) as to its purpose.  Now that I know what it does, it is *very* useful.\n\nOne adjective that goes a long way towards explaining this game is \"strange\".  The concept, the enemies, the dialogue... all very strange.  But in a good way.  Apparently, there was some drama recently concerning the introduction of a Pewdiepie enemy sprite into the game.  I guess some people felt it didn't belong or it broke the immersion.  Really?  There are plenty of bizarre enemies and nods to other games (Purple Tentacle, anyone?), and *that* is what some people choose to complain about?\n\nThe game's difficulty progression is, on the whole, fairly balanced.  The action certainly gets more hectic as you progress, and larger planets have more room which generally means more enemies, too.  Fighting a boss on a large planet can make the battle a lot harder than it might otherwise be as your attention will be divided amongst numerous enemies.\n\nThe artifacts that you can unlock during gameplay are pretty neat, as well, because they aren't all good.  Some will give you advantages to make the game easier while others won't.  This is a good mechanic since it means that, later on, you have the option of increasing the difficulty of the game (in some cases, significantly) if you like.\n\nThe only major fault I have with the game is actually the weapons.  You start with a wimpy pea shooter, so upgrading your gun ASAP is all but required.  In my game, all of the guns, except for the final two which are still locked, cost 1500.  Now, so far, each gun *has* been very different from the others.  The problem is that, with the exception of the second gun, the blaster, the remaining weapons make the game much more difficult.  They might not be automatic, which means *lots* of clicking, or they might be amazingly weak until leveled up a few times.  So far, each time I buy a new weapon, I always end up switching back to the blaster rather quickly.\n\nEdit (Oct. 19): I've now tried all of guns except for the two that are locked, and I think I can lessen my criticism a little.  The shotgun is actually usable.  It doesn't fire nearly as rapidly as the blaster, but it has a very wide spread and decent power.  I also forgot to mention the sniper gun.  I'm not sure how long I could remain alive while using it, but it is extremely powerful.  The downside, however, is a very slow refire rate and no spread.  Bullet spread is actually rather important because the surface of planets curves, in general, away from your player meaning that hitting enemies on the surface can often be difficult.  One solution is to jump up to give yourself a better line of sight, but if you're using a gun with slow reload, you'd better have a good aim.  For guns that spray out lots of bullets, like the blaster, hitting surface enemies is a lot easier.\n\nOne other issue could be, I suppose, the difficulty of the boss enemies.  The first few dragon-like bosses come across as extremely difficult, especially as you encounter them at the beginning of the game.  Expect to die... probably a few times.  That said, it's not *that* bad.  You're going to die plenty of times anyway, and each time you can spend your accumulated crystals for better stats and weapons.\n\nAnyhow, get this game.  It's a lot of fun and I think you'll find yourself spending a lot more time playing it than you might plan on.", "timestamp_created": 1445233391, "timestamp_updated": 1445319769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18558145": {"recommendationid": "18558145", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062566883", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445310171}, "language": "english", "review": "Best indie game I have played, ever.\n\nSharp learning curve, do not read any guides... figure it our yourself.\n\nWorth every penny.", "timestamp_created": 1445205409, "timestamp_updated": 1445205409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18557703": {"recommendationid": "18557703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082649849", "num_games_owned": 3976, "num_reviews": 140, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445200242}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]\nPros:\n+ Kawaii\n+ Wonderful planets\n+ Nice soundtrack\n+ Epic boss fights\n\nCons:\n- Expensive upgrades\n- Issue with retrieving the artifacts\n- BSOD\n[/h1]\n\nThis game have a charm but there are some things that I believe should be fixed.\nThe goal in Cosmochoria is to grow plants until the certain planet create its own atmosphere (there are 50 planets). Visual style is kawaii and neat, every planet is colorful and different. During exploring you will be swarmed by many different foes, some of them are annoying, some of them are really bad. Boss fights are nice but ice dragon is overpowered and the green cloud boss is really easy, you can just stand in one place and shoot around until it's defeated. When I was almost done with the game I found some kind of easter egg or boss, still don't know what was that because I was immediately terminated by blue screen of death (in the game). About artifacts - it's hard to find the place to bring the artifact back, for me it's not worth it. I think the solution would be some kind of radar to point where you need to go. There are some weapons to unlock but they are expensive, after 2 hours I was able to buy homing blaster which is worse than laser blaster that costs 15x less. Some upgrades are too expensive and I was not even bothering to buy them.

The point of the game is that its just a game. It is hinted at all throughout, but the point is that the whole experience you are playing is nothing more than the whims of a guy who programmed it. \n\nThe fact that main character, Cosmo, chooses to spend what he must now realize to be a very synthetic reality planting seeds in what are essentially non-existent planets is only a testament to HIS interpretation of what his life truly means or what he truly feels he can express even in his fabricated / limited reality.\n \nNow i don't spell ANY of that out in black and white. I leave it up to the player to even care enough to piece together the tidbits that you learn from the hologram pods, speaking to the hermit, speaking to the hermit after every boss battle, etc. Even the final screen after you destroy the cataclysm\u2014or not\u2014you are given a the end screen which shows cosmochoria on an old tube-tv with an atari joystick in front of the tv. I leave it up to the player to take what they want from that.\n\nThat all said, my intention is deliberate: This game is just a game. It means nothing but what you think it means. It is, quite literally, simply the end results of a guy holing himself up in his bedroom office for a year and a half making something weird / funny / fun just for the sake of screwing around and having fun with it. \n\nThe fact that a nobody no-name solo developer (me) who never even *made* a game before, created something that caused a guy like Pewdiepie to turn his head and pay attention - a guy who has made an arguably global name for himself sharing his experiences with people for the sake of comedy / entertainment / etc.. the fact that his video reached hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of eyes of people who might never have seen my work before... effing rights im going to make a funny little naked version of him and put him in the game that i programmed all by my self as a stupid tribute / thanks to him & just for the hell of it. \n\nIf that doesn't rub you the right way, Im so sorry to have disappointed you.

I mostly stand by what I've said. This is a bit more than a flash game, the developer is definitley DEVELOPING the game. The map is lovely, it's nice to see what places have already been settled. Also I'd say this game certainly has more merit as a casual game. Slowly progressing through the improvement system and going through the story, which admittedly I haven't had the patience to do, is likely a rewarding experience. I'd like to elaborate on the VERY SLOW part. RPG elements, and taking a long time to progress because you need upgrades is fine, I just don't prefer those sort of games. My problem with this game is building. Sitting still and planting for a couple seconds is just frusteratingly slow. If we could drop the seeds and watch them auto grow that would be much better.

At first glance, it looks cool, with some fun little mechanics, and an interesting idea behind it, but it's very poorly executed... It's not even close to being a complete game, and is a beta version, at best.\n\nThe entire gameplay mechanic is landing on planets, holding the down key to plant a seed, which takes several seconds (even with upgrades... UGH), while pausing fairly often to shoot completely unchallenging enemies.  Repeat this several times per planet, and you get rewarded with a worthless item that you can carry (only one at a time) that has to be set down to build anything else... there is absolutley no reason you can't do both, it slows the game down even more.  After you plant many seeds, dependent on the planet's size, you \"heal\" it, and a chest pops up with either resources, or thost stupid do nothing items.\n\nYou can blunder your way around space discovering new worlds, which is awful, because the minimap icon is very difficult to read, so often your course takes you off the map, and into the sun (certain death), and the map doesn't even display planet locations, just your x,y coordinates on a blank map... it's nearly worthless, and is, hands down, the worst map function I've ever seen in a game, which is made worse by the fact that you SORELY need it to navigate featureless open space.  Eventually you'll stumble upon less than a handful of worlds with important characters on them, such as the bearded man, who will tell you what those  awful items you've been lugging around one by one do (most SUCK), and if you're lucky, you'll find some teleporters that will enable you to bounce around between planets you've rescued, although there's literally no reason to ever return to them.\n\nThe game starts off REALLY slow, since your planting speed is ridiculously slow, your defautl weapon atrocious, and your jetpack fuel limited... one of the least fun things I've ever encountered in a video game is having to blast off into space completely blind, then run out of jetpack fuel, and be left drifting aimlessly until it refills itself ever so slowly.  \n\nOh ,you collect shards or crystals or whatever from killing enemies, and can use them to pay for outrageously priced upgrades between game sessions, none of which even come close to lowering the monotony of gameplay.  I don't care if I could instantly colonize the planets, instantly find worlds, or hell, even had a minimap that served any function at all... this game still wouldn't be fun, even if you removed all the hinderances to gameplay, because there are no fun aspects to be enjoyed... GD, it REALLY is this bad, and it's a shame the cute graphics and nearly free price caused me to squander hours of my life only to be disappointed. \n\nYeah, so this game has some potential, and is cute-looking, but I doubt it will ever be expanded into anything I would ever recommend to a friend... it's just a hair above what a high school student would make in an into to programming class.\n\nThis is one of the most cruel reviews I've ever written, but I believe it to be fair.  Despite the game being almost free, I wish I had never encountered it, because the few hours I wasted playing it, hoping it would become enjoyable were for naught, and honestly, I'd have much preferred to have cleaned my room instead; at least there would have been a reward for the time wasted.  I'm so turned off by how poorly almost every concept was implemented, it would take a miracle for me to ever look at this game again, even with a massive update.

Controls take a bit of getting used to, but before you know it you're rocketing off into parts unknown (or directly into a star, whoops) in hopes of saving the universe!\n\nThe goal is to revive planets across the galaxy by planting, protecting, and nurturing seeds. In return, the revived planets heal you as you stand on them and pop out a chest of goodies when they are first revived. If you are easily frustrated by having to start over and over from scratch (but stronger each time) this might not be your game. It's a game that is meant to have multiple takes - you can activate powerups that you've found in previous runs to keep you alive longer and get further towards your goal. Enemies are relentless jerks, constantly spawning in to ruin your day. With good fortifications, you can hold off wave after wave, but eventually you have to venture out to another rock in hopes that you can get it alive and protected before your naked little butt gets spanked. \n\nIn summary: challenging, charming, and not-too-serious. \n\nAs a side note, this is backed by one of the most dedicated and enthusiastic devs you could possibly ask for.

Watch our review here on Steam Punks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGLwR_WXMlQ\n\nIt\u2019s refreshing to see a chunk of new indie titles actually come off of Early Access lately. While that section of Steam has become somewhat of a wasteland for perpetually unfinished indie titles, a large amount of them have actually worked their way through to completion in recent months. One that may fly under a lot of radars is a small rogue-like platformer named Cosmochoria. Should you pay the low ticket price to shoot for the stars, or are you better off leaving the jetpack behind?\n\nThe game is focused on rescuing planets by planting seeds and cultivating them while defending yourself from enemies, travelling from world to world with nothing but a ray gun, a jetpack, and your space helmet. The concept is novel at first; healed planets in turn grant you a partially replenished life bar, as well as a piece of treasure that can usually be exchanged for small gameplay modifications from the game\u2019s only real story character, the old bearded alien. The elder also goes on to reveal pieces of the story for this universe upon completing each boss. The game doesn\u2019t really take its own narrative seriously; holograms of some planets\u2019 past residents are spread out to give some strange but humorous lines. The dialogue is typically pretty tongue-in-cheek, even the menu text doesn\u2019t seem to care too much about its own story. With the amount of light-heartedness it\u2019s difficult to take the story seriously at all as it\u2019s slowly revealed to you. The galaxy was apparently destroyed by a great cataclysm, and reinvigorating planets and collecting pieces of a \u201cone stone\u201d is supposed to make it return once more so it may be extinguished.\n\nCosmochoria is setup around rogue-like elements, when players die they can spend collected diamonds on upgrades like weapons, speed boosts, and equipment. The lack of tutorials is refreshing, as it gives you some time and space to discover every design aspect on your own. The game is essentially broken down into lives or runs. At first you\u2019ll feel completely vulnerable to the cosmos with little in the way of defending yourself, but eventually you become strong enough to take on a large chunk of the galaxy at once. Sadly some upgrades fail to make the player actually feel powerful, which is a hugely important aspect in this kind of design. Very few buyable guns feel effective and the upgraded speed just makes maneuvers feel more jerky and hard to control.\n\nUltimately progression feels like a bit of a grind, and as you get further it unfortunately only gets worse. Summoning bosses is done by rescuing a certain number of planets, though their appearance is random after you\u2019ve completed the correct number. This means you could rescue 6 planets waiting for an enemy that should appear after 3. This problem halts the flow of the game immensely. Planting seeds and fertilizing them is probably the least interesting thing to do, and having to do a lot of it for no reason is a real blow to player morale. This all wouldn\u2019t be such an issue if health wasn\u2019t so vital in each run; the AI in this game is overwhelmingly centred upon rushing the player for contact damage. Often times we would die fighting off miscellaneous enemies waiting for the boss to arrive, only to restart the game and recoup our lost planet count. On more than one occasion we experienced game ending crashes due to what seemed to be attaining too high player speed, making purchasing speed boosts and entering portals to be a reluctant affair. Space exploration feels vast and intimidating at first, but this is quickly replaced with a sense of checking off a list once the map is purchased. Bricks can be collected and used to plant tower-defense style objects, though since these can be carried between runs you\u2019ll constantly want to save these for something, and likely forget about them altogether. The colourful but plain art is cute and appealing, but to some it can be jarring in its simplicity. Music is suiting for the ambient spacey tone, although there can be some real ear piercers.\n\nIt\u2019s really too bad that there are so many problems to be found in Cosmochoria. There is something here to be appreciated, as the game captures a legitimate arcade feel and does so well to pay homage to Mario, Asteroids, and Space Invaders. It\u2019s not a title that deserves to be completely skipped over, but it\u2019s clear that this one may need some more time in the soil.\n\nSCORE: 6.5", "timestamp_created": 1430965487, "timestamp_updated": 1431125388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15718179": {"recommendationid": "15718179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055830572", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1638, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518882437}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

I am currently at 15 hours and have completed it sorta...i won't spoil why i say sorta.  There is easily another 20+ hours of trying to collect all the different unlockables.  The game is great fun.  The graphics are simple and yet very appealing and cohesive.  The object of the game.  You start out in a universe of 50 planets.  You start on one planet and your object is to bring the planey back to life by planting and growing plants.  You have a jet pack, so you can jet around and even leave the current planet and go to another planet.  You are free to go where you want in the universe.  If you try and leave the universe you will burn up.  Also, you only have so much jetpack juice so try and conserve it while out in space and not on a planet or you could be heading towards the areas where you burn up with no way out.  There are also monsters to avoid.  while you are planting and roaming the universe, there are bad guys trying to hurt you.  You need to kill them first. They will come when you are planting or building.  Yes building, there are buildings that do specific things.  Kinda like a tower defense on different planets.  You have to collect relics in order to build so you can't just go and build everything or you won't have anything left to build.  Also you can only fit so much on a given planet (planets come in different sizes) so build wisely.  Once you have planted enough trees the planet will be renewed and form an atmosphere.  There are also bosses.  The bosses are not too varied.  I think the first three bosses are basically the same thing but they shoot different types of bullets.  Still fun and challenging.  There are lots of upgrades you can purchase.  More recently with the upgrades, the game is pretty easy for the most part.  That is ok because the final boss is very difficult.  \n\nOverall the game is a lot of fun and very addicting.

So the basic mechanics are: jet around in space from planet to planet, planting trees to restore them. Once a planet is restored, it dispenses a random treasure and heals you. While this is going on you will be assaulted RELENTLESSLY by enemy aliens, which gets pretty frustrating. I was having Spore flashbacks for a while. After X time has passed, a massive boss monster will spawn, which necessitates jetting through space while managing your fuel and hopefully hopping between restored planets for healing. This is the phase where you'll usually die horribly and start over -- and if you don't, you plod on until the next boss spawns.\n\nFrom treasure chests you'll either get some gems (for postgame upgrades), bombs, bricks (build largely ineffective towers with), or artifacts. Artifacts can be traded in for mutators accessible from the main menu, such as disallowing towers, more enemies, less enemies, \"no eggs\" (???) and the like. Most of these are also largely ineffectual, as I've noticed no difference even playing with fewer enemies and lower enemy health. Each time you start a new game the galaxy will be mostly randomized, including planetoids, what types of enemies will appear, and whether or not weapon powerups (which are crucial, as you can't buy weapon upgrades) will actually appear. The RNG swing is kind of ridiculous, I've had games where apparently every chest has contained an artifact, and others where they don't seem to exist. I've repeatedly gotten duplicate artifacts, and sometimes I've been unable to trade a new artifact in for no apparent reason. I somehow collected a pickup from a boss after the game was over despite dying to it, which gave me a white screen and a weird three-minute musical number.\n\nIt's really hard to tell how much of this game is actually functioning as intended, what's glitching out and what's just plain dickish design, and much like Rogue Legacy the necessitation of perishing repeatedly to grind upgrades is starting to rub me the wrong way, but to a certain extent I'm still quite enjoying it anyway.

None of the initially unlocked weapons upgrades are any better than any of the other weapons by straight numbers (I still haven't unlocked two of the weapons) , so play around and see which one serves you the best.\n-It's a bullet storm with a purpose.

My current impressions of this game: still positive! This is a stylized, fun game, with very smooth controls, great artstyle, atmospheric music, ambiguous goals (I mean that in a positive way), and just enough addictive quality to keep you playing. The premise of this game is simple; relaxing, even. But what you'll soon fine is that this game can get quite hectic at times, making you go from \"ahh\" to \"AHH!\".\n\nThis game is still in development, and with the newest update, you can tell it's further along the lines of \"completion\" than \"development\". There are lots of great components to this game, that at first felt a bit disjointed, but as it's getting updated, everything is blending in together nicely. So I'm confident that the finished product will feel as cohesive as the dev intends.\n\nSo what is Cosmochoria? At a glance, you're a naked astronaut, terraforming - gliding from planet to planet, planting seeds and buildings and mapping out a very foreign universe. Baddies show up to stop you and you blast them away with your laser. However, as the game progresses, as you unlock more, you'll find that there's more depth to it than that. You're mapping out a universe. Dodging enemies while terraforming. And there's always the sense of an impending boss fight coming up. You have to balance offense and defensive tactics, depending on the situation. Sometimes enemies show up steadily, sometimes not at all, sometimes 4 pop up with no warning. Balancing that with what to build in that moment (plant or structure) keeps things fresh.\n\nOverall, the game is fun as is, but coming together nicely!\n\nMy only minor gripes with the game, as of now, are that some of the power ups, feel a tad underpowered. And that sometimes getting hit will power down your gun.\n\n[Sugggestions]\n\nThe power down aspect: I still think this is too punishing. Especially if it happens in the midst of a boss fight. I would suggest that the power down is timed to like... 30 seconds or so. This way, you're still punished for being hit, but you can also adapt to it. It makes fights more situational, and not as dire. Like, if I accidentally get powered down twice and a boss shows up, I know that I don't have much of a chance. However, if that happens but it's timed... I know I cna just run and hide for a bit or focus on dodging attacks and play more defensively until I'm back to full strength. It could add another layer to combat.\n\nCompass/Map: I LOVE this very necessary addition. Although I suspect it was here, pre-update, and I just never thought to click the compass in order to open the map. For familiar design sake, maybe the map can benefit from being in the top right corner - only because that's where it is almost every game, and I'm just used to glancing up/right to get my bearings. But this is a very very loose suggestion because I got used to it almost immediately\n\nMapping: This is another loose suggestion. The ability to name planets, or mark certain ones, would be beneficial. That way you can look at the map and get your bearings, or if you have to escape from danger you know to go to planet X because you remember putting turrets down there and such. It could really flesh out the universe map mechanic, and help the player feel like they're contributing more to really discovering/fixing this universe.\n\nSave feature: sometimes games go on longer than I'd like, but I'm really satisfied with my progress and don't want to suicide. On the other hand... that could be defeating the purpose behind the game concept.

Also I should mention that I received this game from indiegamerchick for her #GamesMatter campaign on Twitter.[/i]\n\nCosmochoria is a new action-adventure/strategy title with roguelike elements from developer Nate Schmold in which you, as the astronaut Cosmo, must breathe new life into a lifeless galaxy by planting seeds and fending off aliens.  Armed with nothing more than a laser blaster and a jetpack, (seriously, that's it, our little hero is buck naked) your task seems daunting at first, but all doubt washes away once you dive into the game and start shooting aliens and planting trees.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nOne of the first few things you'll notice is that Cosmochoria is by-and-large an homage to old-school games like Donkey Kong and Asteroids, complete with high scores and tons of pew-pew goodness.  The gameplay recalls a time when action games were one of the most popular games available.  To its credit, Cosmochoria goes a bit deeper than that.  Movement is done with the WSAD keys, you fire with the left mouse button and use your jetpack with the right button, and the S key brings up the action menu, from which you plant seeds and build structures.  When you start a new game, the first thing you'll see is the upgrade screen, where you can purchase things like bonuses and new equipment, as well as acquire new structures such as defense towers and force fields.  You make these purchases with crystals that are dropped by enemies, and they can come in real handy, as sometimes you will be faced with alien creatures and spaceships coming from all directions.  At some point, a boss creature will appear, with a big, red life bar as long as the screen.  These boss battles can be pretty tough, especially when you're first starting out and upgrades are sparse.  However, it's absolutely worth the struggle, as bosses tend to drop a plethora of crystals.\n\nI mentioned earlier that Cosmochoria has rogue-lite elements.  The game is challenging, but not in a way that's really punishing.  When you die (and you will, a lot), you lose all of your progress, but keep your crystals to spend in the upgrade shop.  Some of the items in the shop include new equipment, extra health, and a mini-map.  The mini-map is a huge help, as it will help you keep track of what planets you have saved.  As you start to plant seeds and allow them to fully grow into trees and other plants, the color will return to the planet.  Your progress here is marked by a heart in the center of the planet.  Once the heart meter fills up, you have saved that planet and can move on to the next one.  As an added perk, saved planets can actually heal you as well, as long as the heart meter isn't empty.  More trees means more life to give.  I couldn't tell if the planet can regress once it's been saved, but I'd imagine that isn't a feature that's being considered as it would equal a ton of micromanaging.\n\n[h1]Presentation[/h1]\n\nGraphically, Cosmochoria is very cute and colorful.  The game is drawn with a hand-crafted 2D vector style of illustration, and while there isn't a lot of variety to the enemies at this stage, these creatures are at least presented in different color palettes to present a sense of variety, although some of them could also benefit from some added animation.  All in all, the game is very sharp and pretty, if simple.  The sound is excellent even this early in development.  Minimal sound design is employed, but the sounds of gunshots, revived planets, and your jetpack sound just right.  The music is electronic-based, and while it is quite catchy, it could also use more variety.\n\n[h1]Wrap-Up[/h1]\n\nYou could play this game until the cows come home, and far beyond that.  Unlocking every upgrade will take you hours upon hours, and since the world is randomly generated every time you start new, nothing is ever the same with each play.  Completing a \"perfect\" game will take you weeks, if not much longer.  For the high-score nerds, this game also features integrated leaderboards, so that you can compare your stats with other players as well as your friends.  There are a lot of updates being planned for this game, and it could take several months before it's even remotely complete.  However, what's already available is very much in a playable state.  I haven't really encountered any major bugs.  All in all, this game is pretty fun.  Progression starts out slow, but by slowly farming a few crystals with every playthrough, you'll be able to afford a nice upgrade in no time.  Once you do have a few upgrades under your non-existent belt, things will pick up.  Perhaps a bit of tweaking to make these upgrades more affordable could help, but it's not a huge deal.  Developer Nate Schmold is working very closely with the community to make this game as good as it can possibly be, and he's open to pretty much anything.  Overall, this game is enjoyable even in its current state, and it gets a big thumbs up from me.", "timestamp_created": 1423097466, "timestamp_updated": 1423097466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14329345": {"recommendationid": "14329345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092127539", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493665096}, "language": "english", "review": "An Absolute Amazing Game, Amazing Developer, And Amazing Soundtrack!

In this game, the goal is to reinvigorate as many worlds with life as you can!  However, enemies - who shoot lasers, for good measure - intend to stop you.  There are also gems that you need to pick up, so that when you inevitably die, you can buy supplies and important upgrades so that the next time takes a little longer to kill you.\n\n[b]What Works[/b]\nFirst, each planet has its own gravity, which makes the shooter gameplay really interesting, because you have to learn to aim around the planet you're on.  Also, the gravity serves a more important purpose - being anchors for the deep space, Asteroids-esque travel you do through the title.  On a planet, you can move and jump as you'd expect.  In space, however, gravity goes away, and all of a sudden it's up to the supplies in your jetpack to nudge your velocity such that you intercept other planets.\n\nThere's a neat TD mechanic in this game, in the form of the things that bricks can create.  You can fortify a planet with towers of various kinds, which is oh-so-necessary, because every third planet you revive invariably leads to a boss fight, against at least one big, nasty Chinese dragon, who spews projectiles the way you spew...well, never mind.  Moving along.\n\n[b]What doesn't work[/b]\nThe first parts of the game allow you to progress really fast, but for me after getting the Laser Pistol - an exceptionally useful upgrade - the game slows to a crawl for me, probably because I'm having difficulty beating the Fire Dragon.  It seems that beating bosses unlocks some upgrades, which leads to a slight balance problem between a boss standing between you and an upgrade you need to more easiliy defeat it, instead of the game giving you tools that actually help you defeat the boss.\n\n[b]Should You Buy This Game?[/b]\n[i]Yes, if on sale.[/i]  I'd absolutely say it's worth $4.99.

But... wait you are a naked Astronaut with one poor Seed in his back and a Weapon that cant pirce a lausy Fly. Well but thats all you get to start with.^^\n\nIts a Game with a simple Mechanic. Plant seeds, fertilize them earn seeds from grown Plants and after you Plant enough a Planet awakes back to life and give you a lil HP back depening ond the size of the Planet. Maybe you found some NPCs to interact with -if you life long enough. The hole Universe is against your Plan and you get constantly attacked from different Mobs. This foolish ones Drops Crystals and after your dead you can use them to Upgrade your naked Astronaut and unlock new Weapons and yes you  keep naked, no clothings to unock.\n\nThis Game have some Interesting to Explore in the Space between the Planets and on the Planets too. Some Eggs (yes i sayd eggs), NPCs with some interesting to tell or sell, items you can deliver to NPCs, Diamonds, Teleporter Gates and your dead.\n\nThe Game Randomize the Universe with different Planets in sizes, colors, shapes and patterns. After back to life Planets have different atmosperes (colors) and get some Clouds. You can Build Towers for you defense but thats not a Tower defense game.\n\nIn the Begining its hard but after some Upgrades you come deeper and deeper into the game and Explore interesting things and was able to use new Tactics to survive. E.g Build some Towers on Planets (big ones are a good Place for that) , add Statues that Regenerates the Planets Energy and Plant more Plants (Plants and Statues heal a Planets Energy and a healed Planet can heal you).\n\nBossfights, oh yes every 3rd Planet you heal a Boss try to kill you. Good Luck!\n\nAfter all i can say its a nice Game with not one what i can call a BUG its good Balanced and the Developers add constantly new Stuff. For me a 8/10. The Game still needs more different Mobs, NPCs and things to Explore, but im sure after its done i give him 10/10. Important for me would be a option to save bevore i quit (Iron Man like) bring back all Planets to live is to much for me in one session.\n\nIf you like Indie Games with Rogue like Elements give that Game a chance, its a Gem and its so funny Plant a variety of plants on a Planets Surface and see him come back to life.", "timestamp_created": 1420084960, "timestamp_updated": 1420085147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13609876": {"recommendationid": "13609876", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031545484", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436772812}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun little action game, I died a couple of time before I knew what to do but still a nice game.

That said, there is a real nice weight, and the controls are very tight.\nThe AI is likewise simple, but diverse in type. You will often be juggling several enemy types, whilst trying to reform a planet, it can get hectic.\n\nThen you have tower defense thrown in there, to start with I hardly ever built towers, then the game opened up and started to make sense, and you realise they are really necessary as you progress.\nThe planets are basically your health packs/defense/offense. You cant take on the later enemies without flitting around using planets youve set up.\n\nThis all comes together very naturally as you progress, with a lot of 'ahhh!' moments.

I appreciate your feedback and it will definitely go towards making Cosmochoria a more enjoyable game for you and everyone else who has it in their library or who are looking into picking it up. \n\nI realize this doesn't help you now, but as the game gets more developed, there will be more secrets and story bits woven throughout the gameplay. Right now there are a few NPC's you can come across that either progress your upgrading in a way that doesnt require as *much* grinding, or else start to reveal some of the mystery/story elements behind the game. Because the game is so sparse right now it might take a while before you come across those dudes, but they're there, and there will definitely be a lot more of that as time goes on.\n\nAlso in regards to the grindyness, I have been listening and working towards coming up with ways to alleviate those feelings, just by giving more engaging ways of earning crystals that reward certain playstyles other than just \"DEFEAT BOSS EARN BUNCHES OF CRYSTALS\".\n\nAnyways, thanks again for your review, I hope you keep Cosmochoria in the back of your mind and check back in from time to time as it gets further along in preparation for the full release next year!\n\nWith respect,\nNate"}, "12419603": {"recommendationid": "12419603", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974796350", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1414029120}, "language": "english", "review": "What an amazing adventure!

You'll jetpack around in classic arcade fashion pew-pew-pewing all that stand in your way as you rocket between the rocky spheres in an effort to rescue these planets from bleakness.\n\nYour early career as a cosmic space horticulturist will be painstakingly difficult and a bit of a slow start. The game starts you off with the core essentials and not much else, including a basic jetpack for floating between planets, a puny peashooter and just enough seed to get you started with your first plant of each run. The planets start off barren and empty but as you fertilize them with your psychedelic plants become more and more cosmic and groovy. With each anomaly you plant a new wave of enemies approaches and you're faced with defending yourself while managing to plant more in the process. The further you get and the more you plant, the more intense and difficult the enemy waves get forcing you to skip and jump over shots and fight back the small alien creatures dropped by UFOs.\n\nLuckily, filling a planet with enough funky space plants to fill the empty heart at the core means you've accomplished reviving it, and the planet gives back its lifeforce to your missing health as some strange act of gratitude. This lengthens your lifespan giving you a chance to collect the dropped gems from enemies used for buying new equipment or items between plays. The equipment you accumulate through your many playthroughs are what take Cosmochoria from being just a fun arcade romp to a fully addictive and almost roguelike experience with persistent elements that expand on the length of each trip. You'll find permanent upgrades for everything from maximum health, speed of your character, to the amount of starting seeds you bring with you at the beginning and all will help push you on your journey to discovering the secrets of Cosmochorias world.\n\nThe world [b]is[/b] chock full of secrets to discover, and given the randomized nature of the game will appear at the least expected of times and runs. These secrets are obviously.. a bit secret so I don't want to spoil them but can come in the form of anything from strange and mysterious turds to ancient space eggs. Their usage is generally as cryptic as the item itself, and usually involves finding another oddball character in the galaxy to bring the item to. The rewards you gain from these strange, cryptic, and secret side quests randomly sprinkled across this colorful cosmos are extremely worth the trip and usually give you permanent upgrades that will carry over and speed up your future endeavors into this trippy realm.\n\nCosmochoria makes me feel like a kid on saturday morning again, the oddly nostalgic twinklings of the opening song evoke a melancholy feeling in me that is both very happy and at the same time a bit sad. The memories of childhoods filled with imagination and creativity seem so close to us in our minds, but are also far in the past and unreachable in our adult lives. Perhaps this is the point of Cosmochoria? To remind us that even though we're adults, the world isn't so bleak, that we can still escape to worlds inside our minds the same way we did as children and forget the troubles of reality and really expand our imagination even during the mind-numbing process of growing older. This is a game without a demographic, for anyone and everyone to enjoy, it's a showcase of the kind of creativity and imagination games can and should have, and the only requirement is that you have a serious passion for fun.\n\nCosmochoria is an incredibly fun and addictive journey into a fantastically colorful world of cosmic entities.Filling each planet and watching them transform is addictive to me in the same way watching your ball in Katamari Damacy fill with the trinkets and relics of the world you roll up around you was. It's very accessible in its arcade-like execution and controls, but retains the high skill ceiling of a roguelike that keeps you pressing on to find what you need to increase your survivability in future plays. It's the kind of game you can pick up and play for a few minutes, or get lost in and obsess over upgrades and collectibles for hours on end. Not only is it just plain damn fun, but it features a stylish world with a unique cast of characters and monsters that I won't ever forget in the same way I never forget the cartoons or picture books that shaped my childhood. Yes, Cosmochoria is that kind of an experience.", "timestamp_created": 1412010743, "timestamp_updated": 1412025857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769885", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12290934": {"recommendationid": "12290934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002734128", "num_games_owned": 1998, "num_reviews": 340, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480636381}, "language": "english", "review": "Cosmochoria is a strange, strange game.  This doesn't mean that it isn't fun mind you, though flying into this game blind will confuse the heck out of you for a little while until you get an idea of the general gameplay.  In short, you'll be planting seeds on planets to bring them back to life.  Once that happens, they'll heal you (but drain its heart in the process).  Planting more seeds will refresh the planet's life force so that it can continue to heal you.  At any time, you can travel to other planets via a jetpack and repeat the process.  While this is happening, the game gets progressively harder and throws more enemies at you.  Luckily, you can use the diamonds you pick up to purchase upgrades for your profile (which stays with you from game to game).  Overall, it's a pretty fun game with a lot of potential.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWCH2o4KkSQ\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzk7lQHeHrA", "timestamp_created": 1412008968, "timestamp_updated": 1413853165, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473763", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12290831": {"recommendationid": "12290831", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979084213", "num_games_owned": 3581, "num_reviews": 921, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430160495}, "language": "english", "review": "Cosmochoria is an action game set in space where you control a naked cosmonaut that wants (and has) to explore the secrets of the universe by planting seeds, floating through space in search of other planets and by killing gigantic bosses. Got your attention ? Good. Let\u2019s read on.\n\nThe gameplay dates back to a time when the action genre was still one of the most popular genres out there. Cosmochoria is thankfully a bit deeper than that, and even though you will still blast tons of enemies there\u2019s more to do than just killing alien life forms.\nBy planting seeds and growing plants you\u2019ll earn additional seeds. These seeds can and have to be used in order to save dying planets. Plant enough of them and the planet will come back to live again. This is shown by a huge heart put in the center of the planet itself. The heart acts like a meter and when it\u2019s filled up you\u2019re done saving that specific planet and it\u2019s time to move on again. The meter will decrease if you have less than full health. That\u2019s because the life of the planet is also used to recharge your own health meter. Anyway, if there\u2019s a warp point on the planet you can use one of those to transport to a different planet and if not then you can use your jetpack to get moving again.\nWhile planting seeds you will be regularly attacked by invading aliens so it\u2019s your job to kill them while growing these seeds into plants. Once you stop planting and you\u2019ve killed all of the remaining enemies they won\u2019t spawn as quickly anymore. Killed enemies will drop crystals that can later be used to buy better gear and upgrades.\nOccasionally a boss will spawn. These are extremely tough, especially at the beginning when you have nothing but your starting equipment, and they take a lot of patience and skill to kill. They\u2019re even harder to hit when you\u2019re out in space so let\u2019s just hope for your sake that you\u2019ve already landed on a planet when the fight begins.\nYour jetpack is part of your default equipment and it can be used to dodge incoming fire (by hopping around) or it can be used to propel yourself into space. Once you\u2019re out of the atmosphere you have to rely on your jetpack for navigation. If you stop using it you will still continue to float into the direction you were moving. The jetpack\u2019s meter will very slowly refill and it\u2019s key to time is as efficiently as possible. There are red zones (I think they are some sort of suns) and if you come in too close you will burn up and die. If you approach a new planet and enter it\u2019s atmosphere you will automatically drop on the ground. Then the whole process repeats itself.\nAfter you die you will lose everything but your crystals and before starting a new game you can use these same crystals to upgrade all kinds of stuff. You can select an upgrade that allows you to take extra seeds with you or to move around faster. And as I already mentioned you can also bring more powerful guns with you and even unlock new outfits.\n\nCosmochoria uses pretty, but simple, 2D vector graphics. The whole game looks sharp and has a nice style of its own. Some enemies could benefit from some extra or more animations but that might eventually be fixed or added in a later version of this Early Access edition. \nThe game uses minimal sound design at the moment of writing this review but the sounds of gunshots, completed planets and your jetpack (among others) sound perfectly fine. \nThe music is catchy and electronic, but it repeats itself a bit too often and could use a little more variety. But again, these might be implemented at a later stage of development.\n\nYou could play this game until the end of time. Unlocking every upgrade could take you tens of hours and since every galaxy is randomly generated nothing is ever completely the same. Completing a \u2018perfect\u2019 game will take you weeks, if not more. The game also has integrated Leaderboards so that you can compare your stats with other players and friends.\n\nPlenty of updates are still being planned for this game and it will take at least several months before it\u2019s remotely complete. But what\u2019s there is already very much in a fully working, playable state. And above all, it\u2019s quite fun. It does start off slow, but by slowly collecting a couple of crystals with every game you play you\u2019ll be able to afford an upgrade (or several) in no time. Things really pick up when you have a few upgrades in your possession. Still, a bit of tweaking so that you can afford something earlier would be nice (progression feels a bit too slow at the beginning) and would also be better for the casual gamers out there or those who don\u2019t have the time to play it as much as they\u2019d like.\n\nThe developer is also actually working very close with the community to make this game even better so if you have any suggestions or things that could be improved \u2013 anything really - don\u2019t hesitate to post in the forums or to mail the developer himself; he's actively listening. I was surprised to see some of my suggested feedback make it into the game within days of reporting it.\nOverall, I really enjoyed Cosmochoria. So there you have it: a big thumbs up from me.\n\n[Rating: 81/100]", "timestamp_created": 1412008416, "timestamp_updated": 1412008416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649766", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12290669": {"recommendationid": "12290669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037101776", "num_games_owned": 2898, "num_reviews": 200, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434312648}, "language": "english", "review": "These dragons are worse than the ones from South Park's Guitar Hero :(.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_x1SnXtWUY\n\nCute as heck game with 2D cardboard cutout visuals and lots of bubbly effects. Plant seeds to renew life on planets and fight off mean alien saucers trying to stop you from reviving nature. Once the heart of the planet is restored, shoot off into space and do it all again, but beware of the many dangers of the cold and dark galaxy. Keep your blaster handy, you're going to need it!\n\nGameplay gets enhanced with consecutive random playthroughs, gaining currency and putting it into character development. Additionally, it's possible to build a range of defensive and offensive structures to help you keep space monsters at bay. Fans of Rogue Legacy might get a kick out of this one.\n\nDid I mention how cute it is?

Just to be clear you are not buying some 25% finished barely playable POS.  At this point you are spending your hard earned money for a fully featured, mostly complete, extremely addictive and enjoyable game that is still growing and expanding. \n\nEven though Cosmochoria may seem like an evil Frankenstein of retro game mechanics the pure creativity, original art style and epic soundtrack take mechanics you already know and love and make them feel \"new\" again.

Not only do you get to fly around in space NAKED, (which is amazing all on its own), but the tree-planting, planet-revitalizing aspect of the game really adds a unique element to the familiar space-shooter gameplay. The planets add some interesting dimension and strategy to the game; for example, large planets take much longer to revive than teeny tiny planets but also provide much more protection.\n\nThe map is randomized each playthrough as well, which keeps the game from becoming stale or dull. There are things that spawn randomly throughout the universe that you will stumble across, (such as NPCs and other secret things) that offer upgrades or sidequests. I would tell you about them but they are seekrits. (Spoiler! PETS!!)\n\nCosmochoria is challenging, but not punishing. After dying, the crystals you collect from gunning down enemies can be used to buy various upgrades, (from increased health to new weapons, to special abilities) that will help you progress further the next time you play. (And some of the weapons are really really fun!)\n\nBut yes! Expect to die. A lot. You will be swarmed by aliens. You will accidentally fly into the sun. All your hard work will be destroyed by some angry UFO who was, apparently, having a bad day and decided to take it out on you. But know that there is always some crazy new stuff waiting for you upon your inevitable demise, and you will do better next time.\n\nBut the most important thing, I think, is that Cosmochoria is simply fun to play. It's fun to blow up enemies while desperately trying to keep your baby trees alive, and it's satisfying to watch planets come back to life after you've worked so hard to protect them. There's a zen-like quality about the game that somehow comes through despite all the crazy hectic alien killing.

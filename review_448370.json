m\u00eame, du moins il faut savoir utiliser les atouts qui sont \u00e0 notre disposition de fa\u00e7on judicieuse pour ne pas mourir trop vite, sans oublier de faire un maximum de victimes.\n\nDans ce jeu, il y a deux objectifs en fait, le premier \u00e9tant donc de r\u00e9sister le plus lomptemps possible aux assauts des ennmis mais aussi de faire un maximum de kill pour d\u00e9bloquer des perks dans 4 arbres de comp\u00e9tences diff\u00e9rents.\n\nCe n'est pas le jeu de l'ann\u00e9e je vous l'accorde mais il est plaisant \u00e0 jouer, de surcro\u00eet il n'est pas vilain graphiquement, j'irai m\u00eame jusqu'\u00e0 dire qu'il est assez joli (pour un jeu \u00e0 5\u20ac), les explosions sont bien faites par exemple, les d\u00e9cors sont destructibles aussi ce qui rajoute \u00e0 l'immersion.\n\nEnfin pour r\u00e9sumer, si vous voulez vous prendre pour RAMBO, que vous voulez faire votre guerre, que vous voulez d\u00e9fourailler tout ce qui bouge, que vous \u00eates assez endurant pour d\u00e9fendre votre position et bien IS Defense est un jeu qui peut certainement vous plaire :D\n\nArticle disponible sur mon blog:

You're going to be mowing down digital humans for fun, it's hardly important what clothes they're wearing so chill your triggers.\n\nSecondly, it's a puddle deep turret shooter with some progressive persistent unlocks. So enter only those who want a violent alternative to minesweeper.\n\nThat said lets get onto some observations.\n\nThe persistent unlocks offer something to strive for, of course that also means once you've unlocked some of the juicier items you're left chasing scores and leaderboard positions. These do highlight your friends which is kind of neat but you can only see this while playing, can't see an option to do it from the menu which is a bit odd.\n\nAs the developer of Hatred I did expect a bit more gore but alas you'll need to settle for some nice explosion effects. Reality is you'll rarely see or have time to appreciate any of the human/bullet relationship detail. \n\nGrind. Each map unlocks after achieving a cumulative enemy and vehicle kill target. This means you'll be playing the same map many times before you can move onto similar gameplay over a new canvas. The lack of variety therefore is a bit of a negative, the positive being you're not going to see all the maps in less than 4 hours and well you'll be earning xp to unlock those persistent skill upgrades.\n\nAs noted by other reviewers, some of those upgrades remove a lot of the hinderances the game starts off with such as needing to reload or operate the rotation of the turret via keys. Judge yourself whether you feel this sucks although it should be said you don't have to upgrade those skills (but you can't deactivate one you've purchased!).\n\nLevels play out randomly which can impact your run and I question to some degree how leaderboards would be totally reflective of people's skill when RNG could influence the result but bah, it's a silly game so why worry about that.\n\nAn annoyance I found most impacting of my fun was the attacks from the sides. While it's neat you are forced to change your focus to a new area of the maps it's also often done while you're also being attacked from the front. There are some support powers you could call in at this time but it again leaves you somewhat open to RNG on how much damage you'll be unable to avoid.\n\nOn the whole. I'd reccommend this if you want some dumb brainless fun with some challenge (and a sprinkle of RNG). Workshop support is in there (although I see only two entries as of writing) so there may be some additional longevity or at least eye candy in the future. Get it cheap and I think this is a good one for a quick blast now and again.", "timestamp_created": 1506831465, "timestamp_updated": 1506831465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0,

Wrong.\n\nIS Defense does exactly two \"edgy\" things - there are suicide bomber enemies (and not weird scifi ones like in R6 Siege) and some enemies carry ISIS' flag. That's IT. The opening movie mentions the real life fact that ISIS *renamed* their organization to \"Islamic State\" (i.e. note the crucial distinction that the devs are just saying what \"IS\" stands for, and do NOT actually identify IS as Islamic, even though they factually are) and they declared a caliphate. In the ridiculous dystopian future of the game (which is set in 2020) IS has taken over all of northern Africa, but it takes pains to claim that the locals were all forced to support IS (i.e. there is no mention of Muslims voluntarily joining IS).\n\nThe guys you're shooting are never identified as Muslims.\n\nI'm pretty sure the words \"jihad\" and \"Allah\" are never used!\n\nYou never even get a good look at the enemy soldiers' faces.\n\nThere is no gore - the only satisfying kill is when you blow up a truck (which takes a STUPID number of bullets) and the jihadists all go flying as ragdolls.\n\nThe enemies never ululate (that high-pitched trilling \"la la la la!\" noise that terrorists like to do)\n\nYou don't get to rescue gays that IS was going to execute.\n\nI'm pretty sure you never get to kill any camels.

I never played it until today because frankly I wasn't expecting much.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThis game is actually pretty damn good. Obviously it's not an in-depth immersive experience but for what it is it is genuinely a hell of a lot of fun. The skill tree and special abilities really make the gameplay more involved than just 'aim-shoot-repeat'. Some of the abilities are milestones that make the game 10x easier (increased fire rate, no reload etc.). Personally I find it a shame that they allowed 360 movement to become unlocked as it kind of removes the entire Q/E yaw functionality but it does allow for more brutal, fast-paced meat-grinding which is pretty much this game's selling point.\n\nWhile I would have liked some humor in the mix to spice up the enjoyment factor, for example suicide bombers shouting \"Allahu akbar!\" as they ran at you, I understand that this may have wound up with some offended parties.\n\nAll in all a surprising little gem that delivers some solid fun while not trying to be anything more than it is.

Why? Because who gives a flying f**k about ISIS anyways? :D\n\nHere is my review for the game:\n\n[h1] Background [/h1]\nYou operate a stationary position armed with a machine gun and a rocket launcher. Your mission is simple: Defending your position from endless waves of ISIS fighters, attacking you with ground troops ([b]suicide bombers[/b] included), fast-attack vehicles armed with machine guns, as well as Zodiac boats and landing crafts which deploy enemies in missions with beachheads.\n\nWhile defending your position, continuously killing enemies grants you Skill Points, with them you can upgrade you skills, from weapons to reinforcements and fire support.\n\nAlso, you get the option to call in 5 different assets:\n1. [b] Cargo Plane [b/] - a C-130 randomly drops 2 crates of either extra health or extra rockets, sometimes both of them.\n2. [b] Infantry Support [/b] - a squad of 8 riflemen to assist you with the fighting. You can call the infantry squads as many times as you like. Friendly fire is on, so don't kill your own guys :P\n3. [b] Artillery [/b] - fire mission of artillery shells dropping on the battlefield for a short period of time.\n4. [b] Airstrike [/b] - ultimately the best asset against large presence of enemies which you can't fend off, a group of 3 F-16s will drop bombs across the battlefield.\n5. [b] Attack Helicopter [/b] - an Apache attack helicopter is deployed above the battlefield, killing the enemies from anywhere they come.\n\nThe game includes 4 missions with each one is unlocked by killing a specific amount of ground troops and vehicles in the previous mission in order to advance.\n\n[h1] The Good [/h1]\nIf you really want some anger relief, this is one of the games that actually does that. With the amount of endless action and enemy waves, also being ISIS... Just sit back, relax, have a cold drink, a snack, and never raise your finger from the fire button.\n\n[h1] The Neutral [/h1]\nWhile the game is described by the developers as a side-project, don't expect to get a [b]Call of Duty[/b]-style fast-paced gameplay or a NASA-super-computer graphics and effects. Though released in 2016, the graphics and special effects are mediocre, but not alarming enough to make you regret it. It's not the graphics that you should worry about!\n\n[h1] The Bad [/h1]\nWhile I really like this game, after buying it during the Steam Summer Sale in -50% for just 2.99$, I played for about 3.5 hours straight and completed every mission and unlocking every upgrade. The game is relatively short, also not very much challenging as soon as you completely upgrade you skills.\n\nSomething else that disappointing me is the minimally variety of enemies to kill. No, I didn't expect a building-sized MECHs, but maybe some tanks, APCs, etc. Your own support is also minimally attractive. After calling-in the infantry squads a few times, I expected to get also some friendly vehicles to add a little more taste to the battlefield. The helicopter wasn't enough for me, to be honest... :(\n\nThe game would also be great if it had cooperative feature. What is better than killing ISIS with your friends?\n\n[h1] Final Verdict Score: [b] 7.5/10 [/b] [/h1]\nPersonally I wasn't disappointed [u] entirely [/u] from the game.

Then again, pretty much every shooter since Wolfenstein 3D features a specific group of people as the entire enemy force, so it is not as if this game stands out of the crowd.\n\nSo, is IS Defense any good? Yes, but not for a long while. Genre-wise, it is a stationary turret shooter\u2014the game type that is usually a short mandatory minigame in most modern FPSs. Since it only has four stages with two foot soldier and three vehicle enemy types, it is not exactly a poster child of variety.\n\nGranted, those four stages will last a while, since this game has quite the difficulty curve. Each level requires you to kill a certain amount of enemies (accumulatively), but their swarm gets uncontrollable barely after a minute or so.\nThis is where the upgrade system comes into play. You can upgrade your health, main gun, sub-weapon, and the various support powers. The problem with this system is that the player is initially too weak to do anything, but later, with proper upgrades, it takes an almost continuous stream of enemies to drop your health. Sure, this means that dedicated players can reach ridiculous scores, but most may get bored by endlessly repeating the same four stages to get that far.", "timestamp_created": 1496419440, "timestamp_updated": 1496419440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.720780", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32098079": {"recommendationid": "32098079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053548576", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496281068}, "language": "english", "review": "*RATATRATARTATAR* YEEEAAAAAAAA *BOOM BOOM BOOM* FUUCCCKK YOOUU!!!!!!! *RATATRATARATA* YEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH *KABOOOOOM* DIEE DIEE DIEEEEEEE\n\nFun times", "timestamp_created": 1496281176, "timestamp_updated": 1496281176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31998527": {"recommendationid": "31998527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039593588", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496591207}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my first review all i can say i great game- easy to pick up good stress reliever -only gripe night fighting on the coast section bit hard but still s**t hot", "timestamp_created": 1495896851, "timestamp_updated": 1495896851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31994310": {"recommendationid": "31994310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169930253", "num_games_owned": 1004, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498479914}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u6a5f\u95a2\u9283\u3067\u8feb\u308a\u304f\u308b\u6575\u3092\u3072\u305f\u3059\u3089\u3076\u3063\u98db\u3070\u3059\u723d\u5feb\u611f\u3042\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\n\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u304c\u3042\u308a\u3001\u6b66\u5668\u3084\u652f\u63f4\u52b9\u679c\u306e\u5f37\u5316\u304c\u51fa\u6765\u308b\n\u5927\u91cf\u306b\u4eba\u3092\u6bba\u3057\u305f\u3044\u30b5\u30a4\u30b3\u30d1\u30b9\u306a\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306b\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1495883673, "timestamp_updated": 1495883673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503842", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31982417": {"recommendationid": "31982417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078996445", "num_games_owned": 417, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502421098}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a seriously low energy attempt at a game.

Beach Head, on the other hand, had enemies like tanks, planes dropping paratroopers, and attack helicopters which made the game much more exciting. The game also requires that you complete certain objectives on each map before you can move onto the next, and since you're unlikely to finish them on your first try, you'll be playing the same mission for a while.

Terrorists are right up there with Nazis (thanks, Wolfenstein) on the list of enemies you can't feel bad about murdering in cold blood. Hell, you could remove the terrorists from the equation, replace them with ravenous panda bears, and this would still be a fun game. IS Defense is a member of a dying genre of first-person shooters: the \"shooting gallery.\" I've seen this genre most prevalently in arcades, and by Ysmir, IS Defense would've cleared my pocket of quarters if it were in an arcade. Like other games in the genre, you are placed in a stationary position behind a machine gun and tasked with mowing down the frothing hordes of enemies charging at you from the beachhead. Though it may sound simple, things can quickly get hectic and out of hand, with terrorists swarming your encampment from every imaginable angle. Fortunately, IS Defense also boasts a progression system for your character, gun turret, rocket launcher, and support calls. The more terrorists you mow down, the more points you can put into the system, and, in turn, the more terrorists you can mow down. As the bodycount rises, you'll be able to unlock additional maps on which to indulge the game's feedback loop of killing and progression. Really, that's all there is to be said about IS Defense.\n\nIn all, IS Defense is a simple game: shoot, kill, die, repeat. The experience can get somewhat repetitive after a while, but the game is something that is best enjoyed in short bursts. At this price point, the game is certainly worth it.\n\nSmall addendum: I don't know if it has to do with my settings, my rig, the game's optimization, or a combination of those three, but the framerate can become downright abhorrent at times.", "timestamp_created": 1483430135, "timestamp_updated": 1487203643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539864", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28946014": {"recommendationid": "28946014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069157995", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484340784}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite a simple (but fun) game with not much to it, but you get to slaugther saracens by the thousands.", "timestamp_created": 1483373405, "timestamp_updated": 1483373405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474843", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28934595": {"recommendationid": "28934595", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967516650", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 120, "playtime_forever": 604, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492034371}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the best game you will ever play.\nLike, we're talking I would actually wish there was some DLC so I could have mORE1 MORE MORE MORE !!!!\n\nAllahu ackbar simulator of the best kind.", "timestamp_created": 1483351208, "timestamp_updated": 1483351208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462530", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28921797": {"recommendationid": "28921797", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968561644", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 600, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489219580}, "language": "english", "review": "Think beach head.

saying people were upset about this game, controversy, political BS blabla, so I went and bought it. \nThis is a very well made game. The ragdoll and where you shoot people and how it affects them is spot on, I have my body count turned to unlimited and vehicles destroyed all stay there, it creates a real battlefield, which I think is nice. The graphics are really good for a $5 game, its an arcade style shooter as many have said. The upgrades help, but even then the game is still challenging. Blasting away waves of terrorists till you get overwhelmed. The terrorists act smartly (sometimes). What I mean by this is if you have shot the people out of a vehicle, other troops will try to man the turret or the driver seat and use it against you, instead of leaving it a husk. You can cause damage to buildings when you upgrade your MG. When you shoot at hummers, the gunner never dies unless the vehicle blows up, that is my main issue with this game TRUST ME ITS ANNOYING AS HELL AND DOESN'T QUITE MAKE SENSE, other than that, its well made, the AI has some brains, though sometimes your soldiers will be standing in a line and get plowed by an enemy truck like a bunch of idiots, or run and cover next to a flaming vehicle.

The level designs are good and the game feels really smooth and crisp. The graphics on the game are decent, which is good because no one wants to kill pixellated ISIS soldiers now, do they? \nThe game is also moving to Xbox One, and although it is moving to the world of peasantry, it shows that the game is substantially good if it is an indie game getting a [strike] peasant [/strike] console release. I've clocked a good hour and a half nearly in about two sessions. The game is insanely addictive and the leaderboard function always adds to competetiveness (is that a word?) of the game. The ranking system, which essentially isn't \"ranks\" but more just \"you got promoted blah blah have some skill points\" works well. The skill points can be spent on things that help you in your efforts to bring down Allah and his mottley ISIS crew.\n\nOverall the game is great but the only problem I have with it is when I call artillery in and I end up becoming collateral damage at the hands of my allies.\n\nGG", "timestamp_created": 1472729440, "timestamp_updated": 1472729535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540228", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25280155": {"recommendationid": "25280155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081670686", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468244298}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u9ed1\u79d1\u6280\u7684M240", "timestamp_created": 1472705349, "timestamp_updated": 1472705349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25271644": {"recommendationid": "25271644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327715933", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472845939}, "language": "english", "review": "Make America Great Again!", "timestamp_created": 1472662353, "timestamp_updated": 1472662353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502434", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25257721": {"recommendationid": "25257721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163288456", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476567316}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great if you don't wanna think much but wanna test your reflexes and stuff.

I got to the last level with a good amount of stuff unlocked and I almost literally couldn't die because it was too easy. So I think some levels are fun, others easy, and some hard. I honestly wouldn't pay full price for the game right now; there's just not enough in my opinion to spend $8 on. Other than that the game is pretty awesome! It's smooth, well thought out, and regardless to what I said before it does have you coming back if you like endless wave games - though I think the tower gun layout is different to most endless wave games. I think it comes down to opinion mostly - so taste over actual rating - if this game is perfect or not.\n\nAnd about the Islamophobia: If you consider suicide bombers and ISIS flags a representation of Islam and therefore islamophobic - man you're going to be triggered hard here.

Germans, Russians, Koreans, whatever enemy the US has at any given moment are usually fair game in, uh, games. \n\nWhat we have here is basically an arcade shooter. It is a sort of tower defense where you act as a lone tower with a few abilities at your command, as well as an RPG element with a talent tree that will help health regeneration, give troops more health, and more rocket ammo. There\u2019s a lot more but that\u2019s just an example. \nYou start with a beach level where you have to kill 2,000 terrorists. Sounds like a lot, and I died only 300 enemies in\u2026 the first time. Turns out all the experience and talents you earn are cumulative. When I \u2018failed\u2019 the second time It added my ~700 kills to the previous 300 and then I was at ~1000 or so into unlocking the second map.\n\nYou have several weapons in your arsenal including five different active abilities that \u201cCharge up\u201d as you kill enemies. The level 1 is a supply drop and the level 2 summons a few ground troops that I find are actually extremely helpful. After summoning about three groups of them I pushed fairly far into one game.\n\nI will admit, the game feels good. I can understand how some people may find it boring but I find the explosions satisfying and I like watching the evolution from a peaceful beachfront to a horrifying warzone.\n\nThe game has more depth than readily apparent. There\u2019s a sort of resource management to a degree. The skills you get work in tiers. For example, if I used the Tier 3 ability (Artillery bombardment), That bar would tank down to the first tier ability (The supply drop). The more you save, the more powerful supports you receive, culminating on an attack chopper that sticks around for a couple minutes to give you some much needed breathing room.\nAnd the supply drops don\u2019t go away when they drop, you have to shoot the large boxes to benefit from them.

North Africa is now under the control of IS, who is gathering a large army to launch the invasion of Europe via the Mediterranean Sea. NATO headquarters knows the exact locations of the launch, and is in need of courageous soldiers to stand against the invader until the end! Soldier, it is time to fight for the free world! Sign here to enrol!\n\nIS Defence is an action / rail shooter game where you take control of a NATO soldier who is stationed on a vantage point with his machine gun, and you have to kill as many invaders as possible until your glorious death.  This game has three maps available to you: The Sicilians Shores, The Spanish Harbour and The Croatian Mainland. You will have to beat the first map to unlock the second, and the second map to unlock the third.  To do so you will have to eliminate a specific number of terrorists and vehicles. \n\nAt the start of a game, you will be stationary with your machine-gun, a rocket launcher and a certain amount of ammunition. You will notice two gauges on your screen; on the left is the support gauge and on the right your health gauge. Each time you eliminate an enemy (soldier or vehicle) you will see the left gauge going up and each time you pass a certain level, you will be able to call on your support team for assistance, which includes: supplies, infantry, artillery, airstrikes and helicopters. On the other hand, each time you get shot, or a suicidal enemy soldier manages to blow himself up at your vantage point, your right gauge will decrease really quickly until you see a black screen, which will mean that it\u2019s game over! Also, you will acquire skill points in each map and use them to either upgrade yourself, your machine gun, your rocket launcher or your support calls. I really like the progressive difficulty throughout each map of the game. You will find that the first couple of waves will be nice and simple to eliminate, but then you will need to know the right support combination to stay alive as long as you can. It will become a fast and furious game, and you will have plenty of fun. \n\nGraphically the game looks good, with great explosions here, there and everywhere. Good sound effects, too! In my opinion, however, the soldier\u2019s animations could have been better. \n\nIt is a short game - you will probably unlock the other 2 maps within 3.5 hours but you will surely come back to it over and over.

Then you'll probably be okay with this one. Otherwise, you should probably pass. Even for people who enjoy the gameplay, they might find it somewhat stale after a while. In my case, I played it for about three hours. Two of those hours were spent dying over and over again until I finally unlocked all the perks. The entire third hour was spent on the \"desert\" level, gunning down the same waves ad nauseam and realizing, holy shit, I'm effectively invincible. This is as hard as it's going to get. I won't lose unless I actively sabotage myself and self-impose challenges (i.e. conveniently missing all the supply boxes, forgetting to call in infantry, etc.)\n\nI look forward to seeing what kind of new life is infused into this game through its mod support, but the vanilla game, as it stands, is ultimately bland and forgettable.

Now this isnt going to be a bashing review. Im going to give both positives and negatives.\n\nTHE GOOD: \n \n-Simplicity, Its a simple game with a simple goal, kill everything that hates democracy.\n\n-The guns and explosions- The gunplay is fun, its a stationary shooter where you get to mow down durkas with a big machine gun and a rocket launcher, the explosions are beautiful and very well animated.\n\n-Repetitive, but a fun kind of repetitive.The goal is the same on every map, kill durkas. Each map has a level of difficulty and  I find myself dying after a short while but that doesnt stop me from trying again because its too damn fun.\n\n-The skill tree has very nice skills that will really help you out in the long run.\n\n-The help you get to call in ( Soldiers, air strikes, Helicopters) gives the game more life, its not just you versus the Isis horde, you get to call in soldiers to help fight and get to call in air strikes to annihilate everything around you (Your soldiers included so be careful).\n\n\nTHE BAD:  theres gonna be a bit of stuff here so bare with me\n\n- The graphics look great but makes my coputer run a little hotter than I like.\n\n-The Soldiers skins arent so beautiful, youll notice that looking at your troops closely show that they look very bland and the skin quality is very low.\n\n-AI can sometimes be very dumb, Ill have friendly troops all the way across the map shooting at durkas from a distance, Enemy cars tend to crash into other burnt cars or just plain crash into your MG nest. \n\n-The animations are a little wonky for enemies and friendlies alike, it seems as if they took the animation from the soldiers in hatred and just pasted it in there and said \"Good enough\".\n\n-Sounds are great but also have sound clips from the game hatred as well, in my opinion thats kind of lazy.\n\n- The progression system is too fast for my taste. I get too many skillpoints too fast, kinda makes me feel less accomplished if I can 8 skill points in one game.\n\n-Overall the game just seems rushed an unpolished, it looks like it needs some work.\n\nThats my review, this is still a great game for the price tag and I deffinately recommend you give this game a try.", "timestamp_created": 1462245189, "timestamp_updated": 1470850255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524442", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22769963": {"recommendationid": "22769963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018139721", "num_games_owned": 518, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478153811}, "language": "english", "review": "DEATH TO ISIS!\nDEUS VULT!", "timestamp_created": 1462233070, "timestamp_updated": 1462233070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554004", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22769008": {"recommendationid": "22769008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032578483", "num_games_owned": 389, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500814733}, "language": "english", "review": "Beach Head clone with beautiful graphics, destructible environment and amount of explosions that would make Michael Bay proud.\nSupport system is great, upgrades increase strength and spectacularity of weapons to ridiculus degree.\nWaves of enemies attack in random sequences, and their numbers increase as player earns more upgrades, so it never gets too easy.\n\nFavourite level: Harbor", "timestamp_created": 1462227460, "timestamp_updated": 1462227460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22768675": {"recommendationid": "22768675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154425859", "num_games_owned": 1044, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462225681}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]An intensive shooter in stationary locales that takes current events into the realm of tomorrow\u2019s newspapers; IS Defense is a mesmerizing bullet arcade. [/h1]\nThe music is fantastic and adrenaline charging. Add to that the sound effects and voices of enemy terrorists and you are sure to find this game something you will come back for more and more. The opening movie is laced with video & news shorts from today\u2019s news, and weaves out the projected path of IS threat in the European world. It really makes you think about what is happening around you.  \n\nI\u2019ve only had the game a short time, but since many are interested in this game, I wanted to do the review now and lend support to this awesome game. The graphics are great. The premise is simple enough. And, the firepower is great! The card art is something worth collecting as well.\n\nI often say I\u2019m not into fps games, though shooting is something that I can do fairly decently in games. I just normally don\u2019t enjoy heavy combat elements. This one is intense, and you are stationary, making it probably more intensive, as far as fire power goes. You literally mow the waves of incoming enemies down as the suicide bombers attempt to reach you. With the perfect defensive position, your job is to shoot and reload. That\u2019s it. The first level has you on the beach, as waves of pontoon boats are followed by ships with pickups. They all attempt to land a force on the beach and sweep past you. You hear the screams of the terrorists as they wage what they see as a \u201choly war.\u201d And, you are reminded that war is not always a choice.  \n\nThe game reminds me of the words of George Orwell, \u201cPeople sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.\u201d If you are like me, you don\u2019t like blaming a group of people nor a religion, nor other non-germane causes for the evil that takes place. But, the IS is not a religion. It is a terrorist group that is as much a problem for the Muslim community as for the rest of the world. If you don\u2019t see the difference between IS and the Islamic faith, then this game may not be for you. Another word of caution; the shooting is intensive. I usually need frequent breaks when playing shooters like this. \n\n[h1]The game is simple, straightforward, and offers many leveling up rewards for the gamer who likes \u201cbullet-hell\u201d type games. The main difference is you are behind the bullets for much of the game.[/h1] I recommend IS Defense for teens and adults interested in current world events and defending their homeland from terrorists.", "timestamp_created": 1462225724, "timestamp_updated": 1462225868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714591", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22765072": {"recommendationid": "22765072", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961645254", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496826625}, "language": "polish", "review": "Gra realizuje marzenie przeci\u0119tnego Europejczyka tzn. strzela si\u0119 z karabinu maszynowego do terroryst\u00f3w, kt\u00f3rzy p\u0142yn\u0105 do Europy na pontonach.

I was expecting a game was almost designed to leave a bad taste in the mouths of non-radical Muslims around the world. After all, this is the same indie developer that developed and published Hatred \u2013 a game that is banned in Australia and obviously which I cannot purchase from Steam. Hatred has to have been one of the most controversial games released onto Steam in the past couple of years. That they followed with a game where the player\u2019s task is to kill the Islamic State is surely one of the very few ways in which they could have found an even more troubled subject matter.\n\nHowever, I can say that after playing the game that I believe that my expectations were in fact wrong. IS Defense may in fact prove to be a controversial game and others may find the game to be offensive or in bad taste but I do not believe that this will prove to be overwhelmingly so especially when compared to Hatred. In fact I would go so far as to suggest that I found the game to be a pleasing back to the future type game of some of the games that I have vivid memories of enjoying when I was a youngster. Games such as Operation Wolf, Beach Head, Bad Dog McCree and Dynamite Duke. It is the type of on rails shooter experience that isn\u2019t often made anymore because modern technologies has far surpassed the minimalistic style gameplay available to make games back in those days. In the past the level of controversy featuring such anti-western subject matter (e.g. the United States Vs. Russia, games based on the Vietnam War, etc.) have had some controversy but the majority have been able to ignore it. Therefore I surmise that the controversy here is that the subject matter is so fresh and in our face that some may find it offensive.\n\nBefore writing this feature I went so far as to approaching an Islamic friend that I have long had on Steam in regards to his opinion on the game. His opinion is much in the same way as many of the reviews are on the Steam game page. He claims that he is not offended by the material because IS is absolute extremist Islam and does not and will likely never represent true Islam. Therefore he claims that those who claim the game to be \u201cIslamaphobic\u201d are absolutely wrong. However, he does urge that those who consider playing the game to understand the cultural and religious differences between a common non-extremist Islamic person and an extremist. The gulf between the two, he argues, is just as significant as someone claiming to be Christian or Catholic and an Atheist.\n\nI believe that the opening video \u2013 which thankfully can be skipped entirely before launching the game \u2013 provides a very realistic and somewhat educated viewpoint of the potential IS has over the coming years.  It also does a very good job of setting the game up. Sadly, in my opinion, it is by far the best part of the game. For a full release game that is asking consumers $7.99 per copy you\u2019re getting three maps and some repetitive shooting game play \u2013 fire IS troops with your weapon or use a rocket launcher to kill them. It\u2019s very basic but so too were the same type of game decades ago. What is fresh, however, is the nice usage of special effects in the form of explosions and other visuals. The computer AI is hit and miss and not something that I expect will be memorable.  A bit more effort into the development of the game could have turned it into a memorable title but at the end of the day it is the subject matter that is the most memorable aspect of the game.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a relatively short on rails shooter that deals with potential real world futurism then IS Defense is worth a look in.", "timestamp_created": 1462186419, "timestamp_updated":

You are part of NATO forces and you'll have to defend Europe from ISIS attacks. Will you survive? \n\n[h1]Introduction[/h1]\n\nFirst, I have to add some kind of disclaimer reading other reviews from gamers. This game is NOT islamophobic. ISIS is a terrorist faction as many others related or non-related with religion. Please don't say Muslims are terrorist, they are not and many of them are suffering because ISIS. Just look at the news, OK?\n\nAre you stressed? Just play IS defense and kill terrorists!\n\nI don't use to play shooter games but I liked this one. The setting is something attractive to play.\n\nIS Defense is a great \"what if\" for a third world war. If you like shooter war games this is a great option to try. Here you have to kill terrorists and vehicles,\n\nGraphics are awesome also the amazing sound of bullets and missiles. Launch a missile from your Barrett and you will see a great slow motion scene, also, if a bomb explodes near you, the sound will knock out you a little. That's an amazing and realistic thing I like in this game. Each map has is unique and you'll have a lot of fun.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nYou are sitting with your Barrett ready to kill terrorists. You'll have the chance of use bullets or missiles. Try to kill all vehicles and people before they kill you. Use E and Q to move to your flanks in case of attack and don't let them taking your position. Also, you'll have the chance sometimes to ask for infantry and of course supplies, wich means extra missiles and health. \n\nWhile playing you'll get some skill points to improve your health and your killer skills. Once you complete a 100% of the map you'll have the chance of continue with the rest.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\n\nIn my experience, this is a great game to passing time killing terrorists. It's funny how gets complicated with a lot of enemies and you have to use well your resources and don't waste missiles. The game worths it, buy it and play!", "timestamp_created": 1461963772, "timestamp_updated": 1461963772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571238", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22710993": {"recommendationid": "22710993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049417772", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463320720}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes. Yes. And a million times: YES!\n\nDelivered by the developers of the probably most controversial game \"Hatred\" comes their newest work: IS Defense.\nSo what is it about? In case you haven't noticed already, the game is set in a unreal (yet scaringly possible) future where ISIS has taken over north Africa and is starting an offensive against Europe. Your job is to stop them, one Bullet at a time...\n\n(TL;DR in the end)\n\nFirst things first, I don't like rail shooters. I don't like them at all. But this game does not feel like a rail shooter, more like a first-person tower defense, and it's totally AWESOME!\n\n[u]PLOT:[/u]\nYour only task in the game is to pop some Jihadists. How? It's up to you.\nUnlike other railshooters (even though I won't count IS Defense as one) you don't just click with your cursor across the screen, instead you're placed on a stationary fortificated hill with a Machine gun (unlimited ammo, but magazine size of 200 shots) and a Bazooka (you start with 6 shots, you get more via supply drops, I'll get to them later), which can turn around 360 degrees.\n\nAlong with your weapons, you are given a variety of point streaks (Supply drop, Infantry support, Artillery support, Air support and Helicopter support). They are all feeding from the same score pool, that means if you call in a support, you will maybe not be able to call in a different one.\n\nWhile you're mowing down the islamist invaders, you gain XP, which gives your character level ups. At each level up you get one point, which can be spent in your skill tree (4 branches: Player, Machine gun, Rockets, support), which works like most other skill trees (get the lower skills to unlock higher ones, the higher ones cost more points).\n\n[u]MAPS:[/u]\nThe game is really hard in the beginning, but the more games you play, the stronger your character gets, the easier the game gets. Then you unlock the next map, which is harder and requires you to rank up higher to beat it etc.\nI've only played the first 2 maps yet and I have to say that the developers did great work with them. I was expecting the maps to be the same with just a different look, but they aren't. While the first map is an open beach, the second map is a harbor. Where the first map was feeling hard first because of the wide field the enemies were approaching from, you will miss this wide open field in the second map. The enemies rush out of several buildings, stand on the roofs and rush around the corner with their armored cars (yes, they don't just have Toyotas with Machine guns).\n\n[u]ENEMIES:[/u]\nThe enemies vary from regular infantry, infantry with rocket launchers, suicide bombers, Toyotas and armored cars (at least I have seen so far)\nWatch out for the suicide bombers tho. They're easy to spot (red clothing, suicide belt and running directly at you without a gun continously shouting in Arabic) as long as all is chilled, but when the whole screen is full of enemies, you suddenly see a Kebab infront of your face and the game is over. Regular infantry will also throw grenades when they come close to you and run away when they're on fire. The enemy vehicles try to (and WILL) run over your infantry, watch out for them. When you shoot the driver of a Toyota while the car is in motion, the car will go loose, may run over people, crash into a building, drive into the ocean and die or just turn in circles until it explodes from the fire.\nAll in all, the AI is perfect.\n\n[u]POINT STREAKS:[/u]\n\nSupply drops: A dropship will drop a crate with either health or rockets into the combat zone. Shoot the crate to get it. Upgrades increase the crate number or the contents itself (like 100% health regen).\nMy suggestion: stockpile your crates so you can shoot the health boxes when you need them instead of calling a drop when you're low at health and die.\n\nInfantry support: My favourite one so far. This steak calls in a group of friendly soldiers (marked with a blue diamond) to fight the enemies. Not only do they help you get more kills, they also distract the enimes from you, giving you more time to fight more enemies, reload, etc.\nMy suggestion: Use as much as possible.\n\nArtillery support: Covers the combat zone with Artillery. Impacts are random and they might (and WILL) hit your allies too. Also the standard one is really short.\nMy suggestion: Upgrade to the longer lasting artillery and when you use it, call in the infantry after the shelling is over.\n\nAir support: Call in jets that nuke (not really) the combat zone. More effective but more expensive than artillery.\nMy suggestion: Use it when you can affort it.\n\nHelicopter support: Calls in an attack helicopter that attacks anything hostile on the combat zone. Destroys Toyotas in the blink of a second and really takes some weight off your shoulders.\nMy suggestion: Use it when there's heavy enemy activity.\n\n[u]GRAPHICS/AMBIENT[/u]\nThe graphics are great, as you would expect it from a 2016 game. The game is running great on High-Ultra settings for me, only having massive lags sometimes when shit hits the fan but it only lasts a short moment and continues fluently afterwards.\nThe explosions are realistic, shells are flying across the screen, blood, gore and corpses everywhere (you can set the body count in the options, I suggest \"unlimited\" for the ultimae Kebab removal experience. The vehicles behave very realistic (like stated in the \"enemies\" section). The game is really packing and you wil feel the adrenaline rush through your body while you're defending Europe from the terrorist invaders.\n\n[u]MODS[/u]\nI tested no mods so far because the mod support just came in, but I expect some great stuff from you guys.\n\n\nTL;DR\nThis is the ultimate fast-paced first-person kebab remover game in the world.

Gro\u00df was anderes macht man in Call of Duty oder Battlefield auch nicht, nur in Bewegung. Die Gegner sind in diesem Fall IS Terroristen, doch anstatt derer kann man jeden x-beliebigen Gegnertypen nehmen, ob nun eine unbekannte Organisation, Aliens oder Rinderh\u00e4lften, das Prinzip bleibt dasselbe. Je mehr Gegner man abschie\u00dft, desto besseren Support bekommt man, angefangen bei einem Frachtflugzeug, welches einem eine (sp\u00e4ter zwei) Kisten mit jeweils Munition oder Leben abwirft, bis hin zum Helikopter, der Feuerunterst\u00fctzung aus der Luft gibt. Dazu kann man diese Unterst\u00fctzung und sein eigenes Gesch\u00fctz mit durch Absch\u00fcsse erzielte Skill Points verbessern, zum Beispiel, dass man nie wieder nachladen muss, oder dass die Geschosse (und wahlweise auch Raketen) schneller fliegen. Oder man m\u00f6chte, dass der Helikopter nicht mit MGs sondern auch mit Raketen schie\u00dft? Kein Probem, auch daf\u00fcr gibt es einen Skill! \nDas ganze wurde mit der Unreal 4 Engine aufgebaut, und ich muss sagen, dass das Spiel, und besonders die Explosionen sehr sch\u00f6n aussehen. Dazu muss ich sagen, dass dies das erste Spiel mit der Unreal 4 Engine ist, welches meinen Grafikkarten-Treiber f\u00fcr meine AMD Radeon R9 380 NICHT zum Absturz bringt.\nIch habe jetzt 2 Stunden gespielt und bin dabei, die Dritte (und bisher auch letzte?) Mission abzuschlie\u00dfen, und es kommt noch keine Langeweile auf.

They took over all of Northern Africa, spreading their genocidal understanding of the world\u2019s order. Strongly armed, vast in numbers and prepared for everything, the Islamic State is launching the invasion upon Europe, over the entire Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe player takes the role of NATO\u2019s stationary machine-gun operator, deployed to defend the shores of Europe. His task is to blast as many of the invaders as possible, until his glorious death. To do so, he has NATO support forces, his Machinegun and Rocket Launcher at his disposal. During the progress of this heroic defense, he gets the opportunities to upgrade his gear, his body and army rank \u2013 which affects the efficiency of the called support.\n\nThis game is our small side-project and is our personal veto against what is happening in the Middle East nowadays.

An on-rails wave survival  turret shooter.\n\n---- Plot ----\n\nIn a politically-fictional setting, the year is 2020, ISIS controls all of the Middle East and the North African region through their conquest of world domination. They're next major step? The invasion of Europe. \n\nYou are put into the boots of a NATO stationary machine-gun operator whose task is to stop the assault by any means given. \n\n---- Weapons and Skills ----\n\nYou're only given two weapons here, a M240 Bravo (at least I think it is) and a rocket launcher. At first starting out, your weapons are fairly weak. Over time, when you start leveling and gaining skill points, your two weapons can take out ememies and vehicles with ease with the upgrades you can earn. \n\nWith skills points you can make your MG shoot faster and deal damage harder, etc. Give your rockets the option to shoot incendiary rockets, bigger blast radius, reload faster, etc. Better support help like \"Special Forces\" which gives your infantry more health, make your chopper fire rockets. There are quite a bit of skills to put to use here. \n\n---- Enemies ----\n\nISIS, duh, but in three varieties. Basic rifleman that will shoot at you. Suiciders that will rush your pillbox in an attempt to kill you. Technicals and stolen Hummvees with LMGs on them that deal little damage if you tackle one. In pairs or more, they'll shred your health if you not careful. \n\n---- Support ----\n\nSupply Drops - refills your health or rockets\n\nInfantry - helps handle ground targets\n\nArtillery Shelling - handles ground and vehicle targets\n\nAirstrikes (my favorite) - drops bomb payloads onto ground targets and vehicle targets like artillery, but more damage\n\nand lastly, Chopper - does everything the others can do. \n\nEach one can be upgraded in some way with skill points earned.\n\n---- Overall ----\n\nThis game reminds me of Boom Beach, and other rail shooters. Great game to spend time playing to see how far you can last against wave upon wave of fighters. If you unlock all the skills and plan accordingly, you'll be almost unkillable.

Funny thing is, there's a good game here too, and it's cheap![/H1]\n\nSo, IS Defence. Islamic State. Dieties bless you Destructive Creations. First you riff Postal with \"Hatred\" which was a decent enough attempt at Postal, it wasn't -great-, but it was good enough, and despite all the controversy, it was a good enough \"shoot everyone\" game much in the same vein as Postal. It was a bit clunky, it was definitely cheesy, and much like Postal, it is almost certainly going to be one of those interest pieces that lots of more progressive media pieces chew over and fill their virtual birdcages with down the line on slow news days.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, now you're going to riff Beach Head, another classic game, except this time for the controversy angle you're throwing Islamic State into the mix. I mean, fair play to you, you're based in Poland, so the chances of someone running at you with a suicide vest isn't exactly high, but this is a bit like throwing a red rag to the bull here. The people you're aiming this one at aren't exactly renowned for their sense of humour to put it lightly.\n\nThat aside, is the game actually good? Well the answer is \"mostly very, and for what they're charging, absolutely\"\n\n[H1]Strip away the political undercurrrent and what you have is an Unreal 4 version of Beach Head, very well executed and with a very high, almost Arcade difficulty[/H1]\n\nPut this in an arcade cabinet with some appropriate controls, and this thing would eat your loose change like no tomorrow. Seriously, it's hard, really hard. The first map will take a good dozen attempts before you secure a good foothold and get the hang of what's going on, the second map will throw a whole new set of problems at you (such as your friendly Islamic State militants deciding that a sea only approach is a bit last year, they can now come at you over the road an on the roof of buildings), I'm working on unlocking the third map but there's a good likelihood that'll add even more verticality and yet more difficulty into the mix. This is not by any measure a game where you can autopilot your way to victory. You need to prioritise your targets, get rid of the most dangerous threats, and keep an eye on what's going on at all times, as well as call down your various cooldowns as they become available.\n\nOn top of this you have a simple meta levelling tree that offers a nice solid selection of useful upgrades (which in turn make the later levels much more viable), and the ability to fully rotate the turret on it's \"rail\", which is important for dealing with flanking actions. Graphically at max settings it looks pretty, not jaw dropping, but pretty, with everything represented well enough, and the enemy soldiers flying through the air when the explosions begin the light up the scenery (as well as the beach surf turning red once enough of them die on the first map, that was pleasant!).\n\nSound effects are passable, not amazing, but passable, in fact a lot of the game can be said to be much the same as Hatred, it's not going to win awards, it's not going to be the high watermark of any particular area, but this is good, solid entertainment, and as a remake of the original Beach Head, without any unnecessary frills or spills, it achieves what it's set out to do, and it does it with a solid level of competency. Most importantly, it's priced at a point which places it firmly in the \"impulse buy\" area, which means that if you're hesitant, you've really not got too much to lose in giving it a whirl.\n\n[H1]Closing thoughts[/H1]\n\nDestructive Creations are getting a rep for taking old concepts and remaking them very competently, first Postal and now Beach Head, and controversial slants aside, both of these have been executed with decent skill. Neither have been exemplary in either case, but they've been solid entries in the catalog, if these are opening entries in what Destructive Creations can manage, and in time they come up with bigger and better things, then this is a good sign of things to come. As for this one? If you enjoyed Beach Head, well, for the price asked, it's a gimme. If this kind of game isn't your bag, you can safely skip it, it's not going to sell the unconverted.\n\nVerdict : [b]Recommended to fans of the genre, pass if you're not up for shooting a lot of dudes from a fixed turret.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1461175175, "timestamp_updated": 1461175192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571330", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22537389": {"recommendationid": "22537389", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970704194", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505648504}, "language": "german", "review": "!!WAS#F\u00fcR#EIN#BRETT!!\n|FETTfetterULTRAfett#ISD|", "timestamp_created": 1461174373, "timestamp_updated": 1461174373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22537101": {"recommendationid": "22537101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043723929", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462109357}, "language": "english", "review": "best rapefugee simulator on the vidyoe market\n\nI rate it 88/88", "timestamp_created": 1461173306, "timestamp_updated": 1461173306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518519", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22537048": {"recommendationid": "22537048", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970152675", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467671438}, "language": "german", "review": "Die Grafik k\u00f6nnte es mit Battlefield aufnehmen.

Again, while it's short, it also lasts longer than I do in the bedroom and I don't have to deal with waking up thinking \"what the fuck did I do last night\" afterwards.\n\n\nSo onto a better review (skip to the bottom if you just want pros and cons). You can forget there being a storyline at all. You're a big ass machine gun with unlimited ammo (though you have to reload until you unlock the chain feed skill) and you have to mow down things attacking you, you also have a rocket launcher attached but this has limited ammo, the machine gun does not. These things attacking are infantymen, trucks and humvees which can attack from 360 degrees and have a range of armour values (the humvees being the most heavily armoured, infantry having no armour and die with a single bullet as far as I can tell). There are 3 maps which can be viewed as easy, medium and hard. The difficulty level is not linear, the second map is a little more challenging than the first, the third map is immensely more challenging than the second.\n\nThe enemy design is pretty basic, the humvees look like stolen US military ones, the white trucks look like the beat up toyotas you might find on the sands of the middle East. I do like the touch of them flying IS flags, it's nice to be mowing down hundreds of enemies and feel like you're doing the world some good. There are also small boats and large transporters which carry enemies and can be destroyed prior to landing, though the transporters require 2 or 3 rockets for destruction (but they carry around 6 soldiers and 1 or 2 vehicles)\n\nThe graphics are surprisingly nice, solid framerate too, I guess Unreal 3 is to thank for that. The level designs are pretty good, fair. I like the second map the most as it's a good mix between open areas and covered corners that the enemy can attack from. The first map is far too open and gives a lot of chance to destroy enemies before they can attack you as it's a beach and the third map is a little chaotic as enemies seem to come from literally everywhere and have cover until they are relatively close.\n\nThere are a series of skills to unlock. You can make the gun more powerful and accurate, you can make your rockets more powerful, you can boost your survivability/health and you can increase your \"assistance\" power. The assistance is a perk system where within each map you earn experience that can be spent on CPU help in the form of: \nsupply drops; health crates and rocket crates, \ninfanty support; a group of soldiers who shoot at the enemy with you, \nartillery support; random sustained explosions knocking out enemies around you for a while, \nair support; a group of jets bomb the shit out of the map and \nhelicopter support; a chopper hovers around the map shooting shit for you.\n\nThe downside is, the difficulty level seems to be tied to the number of skills you have unlocked and to how many forms of assistance you request in each map, or maybe it's simply rated against the XP you're earning in the map. I might be wrong on this but I lasted longest when I had fewest unlocks though. \nI also found that the rocket launcher is a bit of a gimmick, due to the limited ammo and my resistance to wasting experience points on supply crates, I found I didn't use it much as the actual power of the rockets is negligible compared to the fully upgraded gun. \nIt would be far improved by the rockets slowly respawning as you play every 30 seconds or so rather than requiring supply crates, or even having that as one of the skill options.\n\nThe CPU support also kills the infantry you request when using artillery or airstrikes, to the point some airstikes wipe out all my infantry. Helicopters do not stack, you can only have one at a time. Infantry does stack, but I'm not sure what the limit is. The infantry also tends to run very far out and it's easy to mow them down with enemies once they've expanded away from your area too much. This can be pretty annoying as by 2-3 minutes in each map, CPU support becomes necessary. The helicopter and airstrikes can save your ass, while the infantry often take a lot of the heat off you by eliminating the smaller targets.\n\nYou can unlock all the improvements and defeat the map challenges (certain kills and vehicle kills per map) within about 3.5 hours. Considering the game costs as much as about 2 beers here which might last 1 hour at a push with a bunch of friends talking rather than drinking, I'd say that equates to pretty damn good value for money! I'm 4.4 hours in as of writing this and I've killed 16000 enemies - there's an achievement for 30000 which looks like it might be the most difficult achievement in game, along side the last 20 minutes on each map - I think my top survival is about 11 or 12m.\n\nSo:\nPros:\n+Explosions\n+Killing Terrorists\n+Stress Relief\n+Surprisingly good graphics for the money (thanks, Unreal 3)\n+Entertainment\n+Value for money (playtime vs cost)\n\nCons:\n-Only 3 maps\n-Not much replay value outside of stress relief\n-Inability to turn off improvements once unlocked despite increasing difficulty\n-Unpredictable and non-linear increase in difficulty level during play\n-Fairly short gametime before \"completion\"\n\nSummary:\nBuy it, it's cheap and fun, you wont regret it. There's also a potential for mods in the future (hopefully more maps) so that should extend it some in the end!", "timestamp_created": 1461170809, "timestamp_updated": 1461170827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22536270": {"recommendationid": "22536270", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961124522", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461182432}, "language": "german", "review": "Great :)", "timestamp_created": 1461170202, "timestamp_updated": 1461170202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22536253": {"recommendationid": "22536253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093100024", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486312011}, "language": "german", "review": "Das Spiel macht echt spa\u00df und die Grafik ist auch nicht schlecht.

There isn't a lot to it, structure-wise: you have three levels and four skill trees, and you use a machine gun, rocket launcher, and five different support abilities to destroy waves of attacking soldiers and vehicles. It's very reminiscent of classic arcade games, both in its structure and in its difficulty.\n\nIts simplicity works in its favor, given how the game progresses. You aren't just completing a stage by defeating X waves of enemies and moving on to the next; your objective is to last as long as possible against an increasingly intense assault, with your eventual score ranked according to both your number of kills and the length of time you spent alive. At the beginning of the game, you're going to die early and often, but as you play, you rack up skill points which you can invest into persistent upgrades across attempts.\n\nAs you unlock increasingly powerful abilities, you find yourself able to last just a little bit longer each time, and there's a real element of challenge involved in learning how and when to use your support abilities as well as what to prioritize and when. The real challenge of the game is not to finish all three maps (which will happen pretty much no matter what, as \"finishing\" a map is as simple as racking up a certain number of kills across your playthroughs), but to push yourself to see how long you can last. And you will eventually lose: like the recently released Devil Daggers, \"winning\" just means getting further than anyone else before you bite it.\n\nMy main criticism is a lack of enemy variety: there are normal old soldiers, suicide bombers, technicals, humvees, and three types of landing craft (pontoons, and small and large troop carriers).

Not content with mere infiltration of Middle Eastern refugee groups, these undocumented immigrants invade Europe equipped with everything from their conventional armaments (small arms, technicals, skiffs) to military grade weaponry (humvees, armored troop transport ships, etc.).  \n\nThe game is very similar to Beach Head 2000 and its sequels, but avoids many of Beach Head's shortcomings by including more contemporary game mechanics such as skill points (which unlock features like faster reload times, explosive ammunition, and increased health), the ability to summon power-ups (supply drops, allied infantry, and apparently airstrikes and mortar bombardments (the last two I haven't yet experienced in the game, though certain parts of the skill tree that I haven't yet unlocked indicate such elements)), and having more than one environment (the game starts the player defending the shores of Sicily, with other settings becoming accessible only after a certain number of enemy troops and vehicles are eliminated; the progress carries over into each new game), so IS Defense, while still easily accessible to the less than hardcore gamers, is also a lot more advanced than the more casual Beach Head games.\n\nAn extra touch I particularly enjoy about the game is the roaming camera that sweeps the area after death.  The oncoming hordes are still rushing and chanting their war cries, carcasses litter the scene (there's a feature under the advanced graphics options to have the corpse limit set to \"unlimited\"), any remaining allied troops still fight to the last man, and I've even seen enemy vehicles fatally run over their own jihadists!  Any supply drops requested just before death are also shown faithfully carrying out their last mission, so I wouldn't be surprised if I see enemy fighters get crushed by the dropped crates someday.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent effort from a gaming studio of modest means, and I hope to see some DLC for it in which the player must defend American shores from the Islamofascists.", "timestamp_created": 1461155981, "timestamp_updated": 1461155981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22532629": {"recommendationid": "22532629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278429557", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498417294}, "language": "english", "review": "Surprisingly good for the price!\n\nYou control a MG turret (always stationary, 360 rotation) and shoot waves of ISIS soldiers + their vehicles swarming you.

If anyone remembers the old BeachHead series arcade games from way back you willrecognise this game. Its a Classic Turret Defense, mindless survival against waves of ever growing enemies, The more kills you get the more perks you can call in. You also have a skill tree allowing you to upgrade and cause even more carnage. This is an arcade classic with a bit of a new twist and pretty decent graphics. \n\nNow for the political part. If this game had unnamed terrorists then it would go unnoticed and not a single person would complain. They could be Soviets, Nazis, Chinese, Koreans, and absolutley noone would give a rats ass. But so many people are afraid of this islamaphobia crap that they dont like this game, because they used a modern threat, A legitimate threat thats known throughout every household people have their panties in a bunch. This isnt kill all muslims, or Immigrant Slaughter Simulator. This is a game where you defend a beach from ISIS forces. No different than say if they made it defending new york from a nazi invasion or Red Dawn as a turret defense. \n\nIf you really want to ignore this fun game and rally for its removal because you think being against ISIS is racist or islamaphobic then you should also rally for the KKK and Nazi symbolism to be socially accepteptable.\n\nLong story short this is a fun game, no matter who the enemy is. The turret defence style game needed a comeback and I think this is the best attemptp to brong it back.

Worth more than a similarly priced fast food combo meal. \n\nIt's a simple yet challenging static defense game, which plays like it belongs in an old school arcade.  No, it's not a rail shooter.  This train ain't going anywhere unfortunately.\n\nPros:\n\nKill Islamic State.  'nuff said.\n\nPretty graphics, lots of fire and explosions.  The smoke, mist, and vegetation obscuring the battlefield give it a realistic feel that makes you question if the daeshbags are coming.  (get UAV skill to end this problem)\n\nGets challenging and strategic.  You have to deal with flanking attacks, and balance your supply, infantry, artillery, airstrike, and chopper support.  Decisions have to be made very quickly.\n\nThe real time leaders board that updates as you play.  Good call.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCons:\n\nToo short.  There's only three levels.  \n\nAI is stooopid, even considering that they're daeshbags.  Drivers will run over their own infantry, and crash into things.  Vehicles don't move intelligently, they seem to just follow a set path and smash through anything in the way.  Enemy and friendly infantry make no use of cover and concealment or even keeping one's head down.\n\nThere's only a few enemy types I've seen so far.  Infantry, suicide bombers, trucks, humvees, and the three different landing boats.  When you play your first game you'll see all of them.  Nothing new to see through game progression except the two other maps.\n\nDebris piles up and clutters the battlefield pretty badly.  This is a good feature sometimes, but annoying when an enemy truck parks behind a pile of blown up vehicles and can't be hit.  Also messes with enemy vehicle pathing.  It looks silly when infantry are standing on top of a wrecked truck engulfed in flames and don't even notice.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWishlist:\n\nMore maps.\n\nMore enemy types.  Tanks, rocketeers, car bombs, armored personnel carriers, etc.  Make advanced infantry that throw grenades if they get too close.  \n\nMake it an actual rail shooter.  Do convoy security.  Have to protect the friendly vehicles in the convoy until they get to their destination.  You could string along the missions and incorporate a light storyline instead of making them all a fight to the death.  Ideally this entire game would be just an added survival mode feature while a campaign mode made the bulk of the game.\n\nI hope you incorporate such into sequels/expansions.", "timestamp_created": 1461114279, "timestamp_updated": 1461114279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22525703": {"recommendationid": "22525703", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971543635", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465936571}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing for the price, only complaint is that there's only 3 maps. It is hard at first, this is a game where it's impossible not to die. You'll die, a lot starting out. You get endless waves of enemies until you die, but it gets easier or at least to where you can live longer without dieing as you unlock talent/skill point abilities. For instance, i only was able to kill 50 terrorists before being over run when starting out, about an hour later I was killing 200-300, right now i'm killing 700-1000s at a time without dieing.There are fully destructable environments, you can shoot anything and destroy it, vehicles, walls, everything. It's pretty amazing for the price, the graphics are pretty good, I give it a 10/10 for the price. Glad I picked this one up, it's really fun. I almost gave up on it in the first hour because like I said it was too hard and I felt like an idiot dying so easily, but I realize there's no way to really win, it's endless waves and you'll be over run eventually they dont run out of terrorists, but lasting longer made it fun, it gets utterly chaotic at about 6-7 minutes in, everything destroyed, you can't even tell what's going on hardly anymore how cluttered the screen is how many explosions are going on, it's amazing fun.

Runs pretty well while looking pretty good and comes with a decent amount of replayabilty even before the built in modding capabilties.\n\n\n\nWriting a review before the inevitable shitstorm some of the game media website are bound to stur up.\nIts obvious the dev team choose what on the outside looking in would be a 'controversial' topic. Thing is ISIS is a fucking abhorrent terrorist organization and perhaps the most pressing threat to the first world/western civilization making them an obvious antagonistic force not just off their own 'power' or ability but much of the sympathy they seem to be getting from people within the very nations they would sooner see burned to the ground. If media outlets are shilling this game out as racist or islamaphobic just remember that nearly 10 years back CoD4 did about the same thing over the course of its campaign and is still lauded as perhaps the last 'good' call of duty.\n\nThe game plays well, for a 5 dollar game on steam you could definitely get much worse, less polished, and typically perpetually stuck in 'early access' game. Compared to those IS defense is a godsend.\n\nIts a waved based survival \"rail shooter\" stressing the rail of course as you never actually move from your spot however you do pivot in a full 360 degree area most of the action dealing with the front line and usually needing the pivot for flanks within the game to deal with enemies behind you. I havent yet gotten too far in but while you'll tend to die pretty quickly the game is clearly about getting your skill trees upgraded in order to progress further. \n\nThe visuals considering what the game is and how much its costs are incredibly obviously not The BEST\u2122 but are pretty goddamn good something that combined with the gameplay within leaves me hoping they manage in some VR integration in the future or a VR rerelease perhaps if I indulge in the VR wave in the future I'd pick this is up again in a heart beat.\n\nAll in all you get a really good Game for Buck ratio you get three stages to progress through and built in Mod support so if the modding scene takes off even a little bit the game will likely have more replayability then it has any reasonable right to have as a $8 game.", "timestamp_created": 1461099211, "timestamp_updated": 1461099541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637274", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22522783": {"recommendationid": "22522783", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968398206", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486441631}, "language": "english", "review": "Sounds like someone's in denial over the fact that it took them 1000 hours to beat this easy \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing game. \n\nPretty sure I haven't even played video games in general for 1000 hours.

The premise is simple:  Man an MG nest and destroy everything that comes your way.  You have two weapons at your disposal--an MG and a rocket launcher--and numerous support abilities, ranging from supply drops to air strikes, that you can activate once you've attained enough kills.\n\nAlthough the gameplay is rather simplistic, it's also highly replayable.  There are several \"hooks\" to keep you coming back like persistent skill trees, unlockable levels, leaderboards, and end-level statistics that show how many enemies you've killed, vehicles you've destroyed, and whether or not you survived longer than your previous best time.\n\nGraphically, IS Defense is pretty impressive.  Thanks to epic explosions and ragdoll physics, blowing up incoming landing craft and technical trucks never gets old.  There are also lots of graphics options to tweak, including a much-needed FOV slider.  Best of all, the game performs quite well on my rig even in the later stages of invasions in which all hell is breaking loose (i7 4700, 8 GB RAM, GTX 970).\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a simple, yet fun shooter chock full of explosions and carnage, IS Defense is a no-brainer for 8 bucks.

I've dumped four hours into this game without even trying and enjoyed every minute of it. Allied AI are rather compitant by moving into different positions, though fail in moving out of the way from oncoming vehicles or standing beside burning trucks. However the infantry AI make up for this by being EXTREMELY aggressive with pinpoint accuracy against enemy infantry, leaving you to deal with harder targets. Audio is clear though the music is difficult to hear over the multiple layers of combat audio, which is fine anyways cause you can blast whatever 5FDP song you want to this and it'll work.

You sit in your little tower and shoot some terrorists, that want you (and pretty much the entirety of Europe) dead.\nYou start without any upgrades in the first level. Relatively quickly, you will aquire skill-points, with which you can add some very handy and fun upgrades to your tower and support-units, such as getting rid of magazines and therefore being able to shoot even more mindlessly into the crowd.\nThe support units are useful as well. I myself actually like the cheapest ones the best, the infantry and the supply plane. Both are really easy to get and help a lot. (You have a small bar on the left, which rises the more terrorists you shoot. If it's at stage one, you can use the first option and it will take away one part of the bar.)\nThere is not a lot of variation with the enemies you face. In the later levels, a few new ones will appear, but nothing too crazy, which isn't that bad, if you look at the kind of game you're playing.\nThroughout the game, you will play on four different maps, which are in fact really different from each other, they're not just painted differntly, which is another plus point.\n\nThis game is pretty fun, if you want to play something simplistic just for inbetween. I would suggest buying it, when it's on sale and has a 50% discount, if are stingy, just like me.\n\nAnnoying things: The terrorists that run in your face, when you're not looking and then procede to explode in your face, which can end your game pretty quick, especially if there's three of them in a row so that you can't see anything for 5 seconds (if you survive their attack). Also, sometimes boxes, which the support plane drops, just fall through the floor.

Get flanked, turn around to deal with flanking scum, turn back around anddd have no idea whats shooting at me because they are hiding behind destroyed vehicles or have a vehicle sitting with said destroyed vehicles pretending to be a destroyed vehicle, effectively camouflaging them.\n\nThis rage inducing crap on top of repetitive grind is a no in my book.

Pero si, su motor grafico que ambos comparten, y lo mejorado de su gameplay. \n Me explico, antes en Hatred, era dificil apuntar y los Hitboxes enemigos, estaban mal hechos. La camara no ayudaba en nada y los colores Monocromaticos confundian y camuflaban a todos con el escenario. \n Pero en IS Defense, no solo mejoraron eso, si no que dispararle a los enemigos en primera persona, es mas efectivo y se puede disfrutar de los desmembramientos en primera fila. \nLos colores de los escenarios son mas distintivos, conservan una tonalidad oscura y con toques de colores terciarios, como en Hatred, pero no abusan del blanco y negro, y estan bien balanceados. Haciendo que ahora, se pueda diferenciar a un enemigo, de una pared.\n Aqui apenas se nos trae una historia, pero se nota que es sensilla, para un arcade simple.\n Lo tipico: \u00a8Isis Invade Europa.

However, I will admit this time, they made a simple but fun game. IS Defense is basically a graphically advanced Defense game you mostly find on flash game sites like Storm the Castle when it comes to premise and gameplay. The real difference here is that is has a skin of \"stick it to the kebab\" attitude, which we can all come to agree on. I guess it's a cheap \"get out of the shit\" card after what they pulled with Hatred, but there is something this has that Hatred doesn't. \n\nFun. \n\nWeapons have a nice punch, especially when upgraded, the stages are endless defense missions but never feel dull or boring as you mow down the Islamic State's grunts, amour and suicide bomber sappers and rank up your abilites. Sure it's simple but it keept me playing to see the next levels. You feel like your a field commander and a MG nest gunner at the same time by managing troop support, supply drops and air support, plus, they finally use Napalm again, the smell of victory brings a tear to my eye. It's arcade fun with Michale Bay explosions, true, but it's just pure barebones fun and where we can all come together to Remove Kebab. \n\nHatred was basically a crappy take on Postal and as a game on it's own failed to keep engament and any sense of value in gameplay or \"story\". IS Defence however, it's over the top and made like an attempt to stick it to political correctness, but as a person who just wants fun and a cheap thrill, it's a good one to fish out when on sale. \n\nNow let's see if Ancestors can make or break these guys now.", "timestamp_created": 1517219469, "timestamp_updated": 1517570680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

In Militia you control 3 random heroes against a big number of enemy units. To win a battle, you need to defeat all units marked with gold stars, or \"leaders\". When you kill all of them you win.\n\nBut it's not that simple. To win a match in Militia you need to clear three boards with one go with the same units. Everytime you win you earn EXP and get higher ranks, making the game harder when you win. This way Militia is always challenging and as you get better at the game, it presents more difficult strategic challenges.\n\nThe key to victory is learning the abilities of your heroes.\n\nFor example the Warrior attacks three tiles in front of him, mage can move one tile and cast a X shaped spell or dash for two and attack one enemy. The Spearman/Horseman moves for two tiles and can move on a tile with a enemy unit killing it, and then can attack two tiles in a straight line.

Actually, it's two games in one as there is a \"light\" and a \"dark\" mode with different unit sets and vastly different rules. Basically, you control a small number of pieces (1 to 3) against a huge horde of weaker pieces (10-20 is typical after the early levels). Your job is to take out a couple of enemy pieces - those marked with a star (typically 4-6 enemies are starred). The movement and attack rules for your pieces (and those of the opponents) seem very hard to remember, but after a couple games you'll be quite familiar with them, surprisingly enough, so no problem there! As you move up in ranks (the more you win, the higher your rank is, leading to harder setups - you can also lose ranks if you lose too much) you will have more enemies, while you will have to make do with 3 pieces at most. Yet with careful thinking, you can set up elaborate attack strategies and kill enemies without losing any of your pieces. \"Unwinnable\" scenarios are uncommon - I've yet to meet one, though technically I guess it might be possible.\n\nIf there is any disadvantage to the game, it's that replayability is not necessarily endless - once you learn both rule sets, you're basically just doing the same thing, except in different setups.

Keeping track of areas the enemy can attack is as crucial, if not moreso, as it is in more mathematically-complex tactical RPGs like Fire Emblem or Advance Wars.\n\nIf you manage to get through all three rounds, you gain EXP, and if you gain enough EXP, your rank goes up and so does the difficulty of future games. Losing, on the other hand, makes you lose EXP, which can be a bit upsetting since it feels like an arbitrary time-wasting punishment.\n\nLast but not least, there's also \"Dark World\" mode which has entirely different units from the normal game, as well as Endless and Timed modes.\n\nOverall, this game is great if you want something quick to pick up, puzzle through a few rounds, then put down for another time.", "timestamp_created": 1462503388, "timestamp_updated": 1462503388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563665", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22789897": {"recommendationid": "22789897", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993930568", "num_games_owned": 4459, "num_reviews": 350, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462363082}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a roguelike and it's really good.

But that isn't true.\n\nThe gameplay follows the \"Easy to learn, hard to master\" scheme, as you'll learn almost everything about the gameplay mechanics in 10 minutes, then you are thrown into randomly generated levels. The challenge there is getting to the highest rank possible - every won game gets you closer to rank promotion, every lost game gets you farther.\n\nRank determines the difficulty of generated levels and provides a big challenge for everybody, as you'll have to keep a winrate better than 50%. While you'll be trying, you'll realize strategies and combos with specific units that you haven't thought before and... well, you'll get better.\n\nThere are two modes, light mode that is best for new players (but also provides a challenge) and dark mode, which was introduced later in Militia ([i]but on Steam it's a expansion that is already included with the basic game[/i]). Fighting both orcs and undead is really tough job, you'll often find yourself thinking your plan for some time, as there is no way back after you take your turn. There isn't an undo button, every mistake comes with a regret (and lose, and getting closer to losing your rank).\n\nThe whole presentation, from graphics to sounds, is simply awesome. Graphics are great for the game's intention, you'll just learn few pictograms, falling in love in it meanwhile. Militia is a big surprise for me, as it's simply great game.

The movement patterns are simpler with their limited range but those attack patterns, swap spells and refresh abilities of your units combined with the amount of enemies vs your 3 ones makes you think - or lose. This part makes Militia much more like a table top or the fight part of a classic RPG...with 1 HP units...\nLimited number of turns adds some additional pressure even though to me it seems at the moment that it is more of a rule to prevent endless fights - only have had 1 or 2 fights where i came close to the limit.\nMore frustrating (but also challenging) is the \"3 wins vs 1 lose\"-mechanic which means you have to clear 3 floors before it's a (real) win and you gain XP but every lose will cost you XP immediately. Those XP are only counted toward a level showing your progress and difficulty level - no upgrades or character progress or something like that involved.\n\nOh, and the game swaps out your remaining 'support' unit if you lose your last 'fighting' unit to give you a better chance...or make your fine plan totally useless after that mistake...", "timestamp_created": 1452015727, "timestamp_updated": 1452015727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541096", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20258510": {"recommendationid": "20258510", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982893207", "num_games_owned": 1436, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453839287}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome gem of a game.

At the beginning of each round you are placed on a procedurally generated board with the objective of using your given pieces to clear the board of the 'Captain' pieces. The only real way that it's like chess is that any given piece has a specified move set.\n\nThis game is the almost the definition of \"Easy to Learn, Hard to Master\" the rules are always the same and in theory if you just think hard enough there's no way you can lose! However you always miss that one archer in the corner or that imp. It's strategy in its purest (and arguably best) form.\n\nWhilst the game is local only it scales in difficulty with your ability. The more matches you win the higher your ranking the more difficult the scenarios. However if you fail a match you lose ranking and thus the difficulty decreases. Ideally this means that you slowly hone your skills and hit rank 10! (I'm still only at rank 5... it gets hard fast).\n\nIf that's not enough for you the game also includes the 'Dark World' Expansion which adds an entirely new mode. It features completely new pieces for you and the computer which allow for abilities that wrap around the board, create or detonate explosives and lots of other new abilities that make for an even tougher experience. This again comes with its own laddering system. It pretty much doubles the amount of content in the game.\n\nMilitia is a great game and one I'm likely to lose a fair amount of time to. It's simple yet compelling and likely appeals to a very wide audience including those who do not traditionally play games. The game is great on Steam but also maybe better as a portable game which is available on tablets. The developer also looks to be adding even more content in the future such as endless mode and time attack so it seems that I'll lose even more time to it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1449779591, "timestamp_updated": 1449779591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578490", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19546783": {"recommendationid": "19546783", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999184630", "num_games_owned": 691, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449340809}, "language": "french", "review": "Un jeu tr\u00e8s sympathique, avec un gameplay solide.

It was released on December 2nd, 2015 for \u00a34.79. A review copy was provided for The Hidden Levels. \n\nMilitia is a \u201cbite sized\u201d turn based strategy game which heavily plays like the classic board game chess. The game is simply played with just a mouse and has no controller support. The game has nice contrast between the two competing sides and the \u2018board\u2019 on where it is played. No issues arose for me during my time playing Militia. The replay value is very high if you can learn and adapt to a more simple styled game. There are no difficulty options but the enemies get difficult with each level you complete. \n\n\nWhat I enjoyed:\nEasy to Learn \u2013 Within a few moments of playing I fully grasped the game controlling my troops with ease. There was a help screen in the game which I did not need\nEver changing challenge \u2013 The enemies adapt to you, the levels are randomized and the difficulty ever more increases keeping the challenge fresh.  \nMusic  \u2013  The music in the game is really outstanding and a real strong suit to the game. It really adds to the atmosphere. You could easily just leave the game running and enjoy the music. \n\n\nWhat I disliked:\nPrice \u2013 The price at \u00a34.79 seems steep for the type of game you\u2019re getting.\nNo control of your units at the start \u2013 All the units are placed down randomly posing a greater challenge. I would like some control over where the troops would be placed though. I would also love to have control over what type of troop is gained.\nLimited in turns \u2013 You only have a certain amount of turns to kill all troops before losing. You also are heavily outnumbered.\n\nIf you enjoy games like chess and have a great amount of patience for simple games, you could easily find yourself playing this game for long periods of time. The challenges keep rising and the randomization of the game keeps you on your toes. The game may not have a lot of depth but I fully enjoyed the simplicity and the easiness to grasp the game and rules. If you do love chess and any other styled game, this will be enjoyable.\n\nScore: Wait for a sale\n", "timestamp_created": 1449108657, "timestamp_updated": 1449108657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567849", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19449776": {"recommendationid": "19449776", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992053310", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449107308}, "language": "english", "review": "Good casual game and I like the mechanics.", "timestamp_created": 1449106643, "timestamp_updated": 1449106643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19449569": {"recommendationid": "19449569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052658262", "num_games_owned": 1026, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452868592}, "language": "english", "review": "Really chill Hoplite-like roguelike strategy game.

Don't get me wrong, some of the early game difficulty is reasonably easy, but with the new changes to force a bit more strategy and causing you to think about your moves a bit more due to what's on screen and the number of turns, and the game's chess like mechanics do work in that sense. The developer obviously gives a crap about his game and meeting gamers requirements, as he responded rather quickly to my initial video/information, and changed the game in line. So in short: like Chess? Like strategy? Take a look at the game.\n\n[b] Gameplay Footage and Video Review:  https://youtu.be/MhFGxq6L93E\n[/b]\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]+:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Good core strategy elements.

In particular, even though I didn't like it at first, the force mage was a nice touch and really became fun to use once I got a hold of it.\n[*] Good Implementation of controls to see where you can move, and color coating certain elements of the game (like teleport moves) to understand what it meant. \n[*] Advanced tactics in refresh mechanics works rather nicely, rewarding players for smart play. \n[*] Like the simple aesthetic and there's a clean look that works rather well.\n[/list]\n\n[b]-:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]  The AI. The AI's inability to take advantage of the situations at times can lead to easy solutions and can really ruin the experience. The generals in question shouldn't charge you with reckless advantage if they are the last one alive.

The levels were large and expansive, certain of the AI enemies were intelligent and challenging, and graphically it stacked up well against its contemporaries, beginning the reputation of the Unreal Engine.\n\nWhile many of its mechanics are somewhat dated and bland now, it is important to remember that Unreal was released nearly 20(!) years ago - 1998. A combination of the below two guides will make your playthrough more palatable on modern systems - specifically, I used the unofficial v227i patch, and the Extreme textures, which made a substantial difference to the look of the game.\n\nAll credit for the below two guides goes to the respective OPs:\n[url]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=712297329[/url]\n[url]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=129368243[/url]\nHighly recommended to FPS fans - this is a vital piece of history which needs to be experienced.\n\nPlayed on Windows 10 Pro x64 without any issues.

Excellent level design, and a long game. Played it for the first time this year so I'm not blinded by its nostalgia. The game starts off really slow, with the most basic of guns which aren't that fun to fire and the most basic of enemies and the least exciting levels for the first 2-3 hours. Once you get the Flak Cannon, things change and things get super fun after that point. The last couple of levels just wowed me with its scale and intricate level design. You would get stuck at certain places, and some of the areas seemed a little cheap when it came to puzzle solving. Such mechanics don't exist these days so you'd tend to find it annoying and cheap. Fret not, for these scenarios are far too rare, and Youtube always exists.\n\nBut one major problem however is the technical side of things, atleast without a ton of tampering. The mouse doesn't move right. There is an option for 'Raw mosue input', which is supposed to fix any mouse smoothing / acceleration, but I simply wasn't able to enable it. After a few minutes of trying to get it work right, I just gave up. Got used to it and since the game has slow combat (but good combat), I didn't find this to be too much of a hindrance. It initially seemed like a killer at start, but really, it didn't bother me at all after a point considering the nature of this game. I did download some unofficial patch for it, and it still didn't fix anything. But don't let this affect your decision in buying the game, because despite its issues, it's a great game.", "timestamp_created": 1516213336, "timestamp_updated": 1516213481, "voted_up": true,

It's Unreal.\"\n\nDisclaimer: I love Unreal. I'll try and be objective. As tears roll down my face and I tremble before the screen as the adrenaline rush wears off, I'll try and be unbiased. No promises.\n\n(First off, download the (Epic Games approved) 227i patch and you'll fix most problems. Then, you're good to go.)\n\nYeah, I'm the guy that discusses presentation first, so let's get this out of the way: \nUnreal engine 1 is old, and it shows, but as with most well-crafted 90s games, it's mostly the character models and animations that haven't aged quite well. The texturework is great, the weapon models are great, the environments are amazing, imaginative, hell, even the skyboxes are gorgeous. The sound in this game is also top-notch, everything from the music, the gun sounds to the enemy grunts and roars and squeaks, everything is as it should be. Movement in this game is fine-tuned, hyper-responsive and smooth.\n\nAnd it has to be. Because in ye olde times, some evil genius at Epic games designed the most relentless, punishing, ass-kicking enemy AI the world has ever shaken a crosshair at. You know how, in some shooters, you kind of become immune to the event of seeing an enemy because you left-click and they disappear? Here, everytime someone jumps in front of your face, you will crap your pants, strafe, jump, shoot until they finally drop dead. Though the enemies are somewhat (*somewhat*) bullet-spongy, the way they move and attack you'd swear there's someone on the other side, sadistically cackling at your feeble attempts at victory. They dodge rockets and projectile weapons, some even use the same weapons you do, and they're hell-bent on splattering your guts all over the wonderful level designs. And you better pray you've managed your ammo well. Because the Dispersion pistol is like throwing beans at an ogre.\n\nSpeaking of weapons - no one does weapons like this anymore. THE F&$K HAPPENED, YO?! You've got a measly projectile-based Dispersion pistol, soon replaced by an AutoMag pistol, then things move up from ASDM (aka Shock Rifle) and Ripper (launcher of spinning discs of death) until you get your hands on the fabled Flak Cannon, the Rocket Launcher, the GES BioRifle, a sniper rifle, and two iterations of a Minigun. Every weapon is balanced perfectly, they all have alternate fire modes and ammo is distributed masterfully. That doesn't mean it abounds, it takes considerable restraint not to blow everything at once, but every time you seem to be running low on something, it shows up sooner or later.\n\nWe're missing one more piece of the puzzle, the level design. You wake up in a cell on a ship with your Dpistol and your trusty Universal Translator. This is a fairly genius way of slipping both lore and objectives to the player without annoying cutscenes and walls of text to read. The only downside here is that the last thing you looked at with your translator is what appears when you call it up - a \"log\" function would've been nice, because sometimes, you lose critical objective reminders. For example, you find an engineer's log that says there's a coolant leak and that you should activate the pump so you can access the power generator, which basically means \"go here because you need to activate this system to open that door\", but then you look at a door and all that useful info gets substituted for a simple door label (Main Hall). I sorta-maybe promised I'd be \nobjective, and here it goes: while the level design is awesome, the game can turn into a wander-fest fairly quickly if you're not aware of what switch you hit, what switch you have to hit and what your final goal is. I sometimes spent quite some time re-navigating a level if I left it unfinished and came back after a few days. Luckily, the levels have enough detail and polish so that navigation is hardly a problem, and the variety of the environments you move through as you progress the very simple story - get off the planet Na Pali alive and eliminate the Skaarj - also helps to keep you engaged.\n\nThus, when you combine the uncompromising enemies, the incredible arsenal and the outstanding level design, you have something as close to 90s FPS perfection as you could possibly get. Writing this on Steam feels like treason, but I never understood why Half-Life got all the spotlight and praise and not this exquisite piece. As I mentioned, the level design can get confusing and I'm not a big fan of the \"touch switch to activate it\" system instead of using a \"use\" button, but that's really the only thing I can find fault with.\n\nThere are certain elements in this game that have been sadly phased out as FPS games changed, for better or worse.

I remember i only ever got as far as getting out of the vortex rikers ship and going in that house. I never took on the first enemies, i was a young kid and this game scared the absolute crap out of me. Also the inverted mouse made it impossible for me to aim back then as i was bad enough already with the mouse. But even so, i absolutely loved this game and would get excited to go home and play the tournament part. The maps were awesome to. The sounds are incredible and perfect for the game. As a kid i didn't understand games like doom and unreal which added to the fun. Playing it again now it still scares me honestly. Worth every cent this game. \n\nAlso my copy of the game had a demo of alien vs predator with it. Now that was terrifying. I never even made it out of the hallway thing you spawn in. id just throw flares and shoot the aliens until i was out of magazines then scream in fear when they get me. Good times. something i will never get back. Because i was a kid then (and had no clue how games work) but also at that time those graphics were basically life like and the best. And the decapitation these games had was super brutal back then, it was awesome. \n\nIf you hadn't had an experience like me and feel like you cant relate i honestly feel bad for you, this was an amazing game back when it came out and i was really young.

I didn't even know this game existed until earlier this year. With that out of the way here's my review\n\nIt's extremely good.\n\nYou'll have to install a patch to get it running, but there's a great guide explaining how to by DUNCAN DONUTS, you should be able to find it pretty easily. The installation's also really easy since the patch uses an installer. Once you've done that, just get rid of the FPS limit in the advanced options and you're good to go. Another thing to note is this is one of those older games that wasn't made for 1080p, so all the UI looks really small even on a large monitor, I recommend 720p.\nAll of this setup only takes about 5 minutes, it's not much of a hassle, and to be fair you should expect to have to do some kinda extra setup anyway for a game this old.\n\nVisually the game's obviously dated, but it's not ugly, some effects like the fog and a few bits of lighting still actually look pretty decent. The visuals don't take away from the atmosphere though, the sound design is great with tons of little details like being able to hear lights humming when you get close to them, and despite the audio quality not being as good as today, none of the sound effects are painful or ear-grating. The soundtrack is great too, my favorite song so far is Shared Dig, though it definitely sounds best alongside the game rather than on it's own imo.\n\nThe gameplay's solid, it's the usual arcade shooting you'd expect from the time, each gun has an alternate fire that's decently different from it's normal use. For example the rocket launcher doubles as a grenade launcher, there's another weapon that works like a railgun, but you can also shoot a slow-moving orb instead that does more damage, it's really well put together overall.\n\nMy only main complaint so far is some of the level design, the first (technically the 2nd) level of the game is pretty large with a lot of branching paths, that kinda thing doesn't really work in a game like this, especially since only one of those paths is going to lead you to the next level. The level also just feels a lot bigger than it needs to be. Everything after that's kind of a mixed bag, some levels are great and linear enough to where you won't get lost, but still allow for some exploration and secrets to find, while others are pretty large and confusing. It's not bad enough to make the game unplayable or anything though.

The visuals were jaw dropping along with the beautiful dynamic music, unique weapons & enemies,  and versatile level design of its alien world. Combine all these and you've got an extremely atmospheric and stunning game.\n\nI feel lucky to have experienced it then and I long for the day when another game comes by and blows me away like Unreal did. At the beginning of the second level when you step outside the ship to see the vast open landscape with a beautiful waterfall, sky, birds flying above (which you can shoot down) and the epic ambient music kicks in-- that's one of the best moments in gaming history. Never before in a video game had anyone seen such a large open area as that, let alone so detailed and alive.\n\nMake no mistake about it, this is the most beautiful and atmospheric (old school) shooter with the best soundtrack you will ever play. Even today, nearly 20 years later, the game still looks amazing.  Just look at [url=https://youtu.be/nedohYSmXLY]this fly-by intro[/url] of the game.  If that doesn't pique your interest and make you wanna play it, you should be ashamed to call yourself a gamer!\n\nThis was Epic MegaGame's flagship title and the birth of the Unreal Engine; the most widely used and popular game engine to date. Today, roughly over 600 games are powered by the Unreal Engine including big hits like Borderlands 2, Bioshock Infinite, Mass Effect 2, Rocket League and the Batman series just to name a few. There's no denying this is one of the most important and influential releases ever.\n\n\n[h1]HELPFUL LINKS[/h1]\n\n[list][*]http://oldunreal.com/oldunrealpatches.html\nLatest community made (semi-official) patch.

The music to this day always been making me dream of this strange world ( beautiful ambient and soundtrack) . The colors are still to me the best color choice we've ever had in a futuristic/parallel universe FPS .

for reasons including:\n\n- Combat is not the usual kind, that fights are quick and twitchy. The enemies take a fair bit of damage, and it makes for longer and more interesting fights. I'd propably not really like it if weapons had realistic damage.\n\n- Gunplay feels quite nice. (with 227 patch UT99 based sounds, the original weapon sounds are quite subtile) Weapons have a suitable recoil in the animations and you get some shake too from shooting the weapons. Automag's bang, minigun and rifle's sharp blasts are perhaps the best sounds.\n\n\n- Great weapon variety..only 3 conventional firearms, them being a handgun, sniper rifle and a minigun with pointlessly fiddly but cool barrel setup. Rest of the weapons include a bolt type energy pistol, a crystal spike firing nailgun analogy, beam energy rifle, multi barrel rocket launcher, a huge shotgun like cannon that fires rather large metal chunks in a spread similarly to a shotgun, 3 bladed disc launcher, a device that fires sticky and volatile green goop. Every weapon has an altfire, here I described only primary firemodes. So yeah a lot of depth in the gunplay.\n\n- The atmosphere..wonderful. The music, art style, sounds and premise/lore itself mesh together in a way that creates a really excellent sensation/perception of the game's feel. It rivals the first S.T.A.L.K.E.R I even dare say..\n\n- Great soundtrack. There are somber, moody, energized and calming tunes all, every of them fitting the level perfectly. Neve's crossing and Bounds of Foundry tunes in particular..are just MAGICAL.\n\n- Graphics have held up pretty well for being about 20 years old. I mean yeah, there sure isn't advanced shaders or post processing effects and the environments are blocky but the developers made the most of their beautiful creation, the Unreal Engine. I can perfectly picture how the places would look in real life, how the water would shimmer and shine, how the sky would look and so on.\n\n- Multiplayer is great, coop is my favorite gamemode. But sadly not a lot of players active..\n\nThe bad:\n\nDevelopers cut some really great maps that were in the 1997 beta..thankfully though some of them were retouched and reimplemented in the expansion pack.", "timestamp_created": 1500325033, "timestamp_updated": 1501450311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577870", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33598708": {"recommendationid": "33598708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319904071", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500690548}, "language": "english", "review": "In many ways, this isn't a very good game anymore.

The original version still runs fine without any patches but this updated version is much better, hassle-free and rock steady. One thing i remember fondly about this game that i couldn't find in any other fps shooter is a weapon that shoots spinning disc cutter that can bounce around corners (Predator style weapon). Fun weapon to use when surrounded by enemies; watch them scramble for cover and watch-out it can cut hurt the player as well.\n\nHighly recommended, can't go wrong with this one.

This was the introduction of that legendary Unreal AI which really hasn't been beat to date. The music makes you feel like you are in an early 90's movie which is fun for a man of my age and brings back a lot of memories.\n\nThe level design is a bit frustrating at times. There is no map and the levels can be very large and complicated. You will definitely spend a lot of time exploring and getting lost in the process which I suppose can be part of the fun if you look at it that way.\n\nThe guns are really cool and unique which made the subsequent Unreal Tournament an obvious success.\n\nMaybe this was more of my own system's problem but I experienced a lot of strange audio glitches.

At the time, it was revolutionary in terms of its engine and capabilities, standing shoulder to shoulder with the likes of Quake. At that time, I was young and played it with cheats on - just wanting a power trip I suppose.\n\nI picked it up again in a Steam sale and it languished in my library for several years. Laterly, I've been going over that library and picking titles to get into and actually complete. Unreal Gold caught my eye and I decided to give it a go. Fairly this time - no cheats and medium difficulty. I don't have all the time in the world to struggle through the hardest difficulty, but I still want a challenge.\n\nI know a lot of people on Steam try to give marks for various portions of the game - gameplay, graphics, sound, etc. I don't think I can quantify any game in that manner. All I can give are my impressions of it and how much fun it was to play. Overall, Unreal and the expansion campaign was entertaining. Gunplay was quick and generally responsive; the need to collect and manage both ammo and health were a hallmark of the 90s FPS genre. The guns themselves were ok, but they lacked any real impact. Sometimes, it seemed like I was firing marshmellows at the Skaarj rather than hot lead. The Eightball launcher was particularly lacking in that feel of something dangerous being thrown around. Levels were varied to an extent, but I caught myself thinking, more than once during the campaign, that the levels were almost like a slog to get through, rather than fun. Some seemed to stretch on and on, and a few were confusing enough that I had to consult the Internet to figure out where to go. In a linear FPS, that's rather strange. I like the lack of hand holding, but searching an area for 20 minutes to figure out where I am to go or find what moved when I pressed a button was irritating.\n\nMy other complaint was the lack of light in the game. There were places that were terribly dark, and the ingame flashlight was woefully inadequate to illuminating these. Flares were ok, but too few.\n\nDespite these complaints, the game was enjoyable overall. While gunplay suffered a bit, the Flak Cannon more than made up for that. Killing your way around Na Pali was still a romp I would recommend at least once.

I bought it whenever I bought it on steam more recently (probably a few years ago) and probably never played through it because of various life events and just adulthood in general, but I fired it up again recently and was immediately reminded why I love this game.\n\nIt is, to this day, one of the most enthralling games I've ever played.  Much like Half-Life (which was released soon after) this game tells it's story and moves the player forward directly through the gameplay, without cutscenes or very much dialogue.  You get a PDA like device which is used to read things written by other \"characters\" in the game or just messages in the world/translating a sign written in an alien language.\n\nLike the store page says, you start as a prisoner (from what I can gather) and that's what I really love about the story in this game; the protagonist is just a piece of flesh that was discarded by a society.  They aren't the chosen one, a spy on a special mission or an elite spec ops soldier (even though there are subtle and maybe not-so-subtle religious overtones that suggest otherwise).  No one within a thousand of light years from where you are cares about you.  You're not special.  You're garbage.  It's beautifully grave and nihilistic.  Don't get me wrong; there are certain aspects of the narrative that kind of give you an ego boost in a roundabout way, but the game pretty much lets on that you are just the wrong person at the right time.\n\nAs far as the gameplay itself, you can definitely see how in an alternate universe, that this game could have been the single player phenom that half-life turned out to be:  Super fast paced combat against agile, unforgiving enemies that take lots of rounds to kill, interspersed with moments of unease as you tread through dark and quiet maze-like hallways, changing to more open outdoor areas and puzzles that span large sections of a maps.\n\nObviously, by todays standards, this game is going to look extremely dated, but that only makes the theatricality of the setpieces that much more impressive. Lastly, while other games that had come out at that time used every chance they could to use colored lighting in the tackiest possible way, the artists in this game used a much more subtle and \"thematic\" approach that really lets that first version of the Unreal Engine show it's worth for that era.\n\nAnd for those of you who, like myself, like to lose hours upon hours into a game, then this has that covered.  It is NOT a 5-6 hour quickie like a lot of modern FPS campaigns.

Le llamaron \"Quake 2 killer\", puesto que rivalizaba directamente con el t\u00edtulo de Id Software. Desarrollado por Epic Games, Inc., fue el origen de la famosa saga y el Unreal Engine, el motor gr\u00e1fico m\u00e1s conocido y usado en el mundo de los videojuegos.\n\nNo pude jugarlo en su \u00e9poca debido a que no ten\u00eda un equipo que cumpliese los requisitos que exig\u00eda por aquel entonces, por lo que lo he jugado por primera vez casi 20 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su lanzamiento. Mi an\u00e1lisis se ha hecho teniendo en cuenta el a\u00f1o de salida del juego (a\u00f1o 1998), donde lleg\u00f3 a ser el top gr\u00e1fico que hab\u00eda por aquel entonces. \n\n[h1]HISTORIA:[/h1]\n\nEncarnamos el papel del prisionero n\u00ba 849. Estamos encerrados en una celda a bordo de una nave-prisi\u00f3n, pero durante el viaje por el espacio la nave se estrella en el planeta Na Pali, donde transcurre toda la aventura.\n\nPor el impacto quedamos inconscientes y tras recuperarnos, empezamos a controlar a nuestro personaje. Ah\u00ed nos damos cuenta de que el impacto de la nave ha desactivado los sistemas de seguridad y podemos escapar de nuestra celda. Al principio comenzaremos sin ning\u00fan tipo de arma ni objetos, tendremos que ir buscando vida y armas por el interior de la nave.\n\nPronto nos daremos cuenta de que el planeta donde nos encontramos, Na-Pali, es habitado por los Nali, una raza alien\u00edgena primitiva y pac\u00edfica de aspecto humanoide pero con cuatro brazos, que viv\u00edan en paz y harmon\u00eda hasta la llegada de unos alien\u00edgenas llamados Skaarj que est\u00e1n interesados en el Tarydium, un cristal que posee una gran energ\u00eda y que es muy abundante en este planeta. Los skaarj est\u00e1n invadiendo el planeta y acabando con la vida de los Nali, someti\u00e9ndolos a todo tipo de torturas.\n\nTras huir de la nave tendremos que recorrer enormes extensiones de terreno, visitando aldeas, castillos, fortalezas, naves, etc. enfrent\u00e1ndonos a los Skaarj y sus guerreros entre otros muchos peligros.\n\nNuestra misi\u00f3n es escapar del planeta Na-Pali. El argumento es interesante y aunque no demasiado complejo, est\u00e1 bastante bien llevado. No alcanza el nivel de Half-Life en este aspecto ni mucho menos, pero s\u00ed es un factor m\u00e1s importante que en la mayor\u00eda de los shooters de esos a\u00f1os.\n\n[h1]JUGABILIDAD:[/h1]\n\nUn shooter incre\u00edblemente fren\u00e9tico, de los de la vieja usanza pero con algunas innovaciones interesantes que hemos visto aplicadas posteriormente en otros juegos, como poder hacer saltos en todas las direcciones para esquivar a nuestros enemigos. A\u00fan a d\u00eda de hoy sigue resultando tremendamente divertido y adcitivo. \n\nDispondremos de una cantidad enorme de armamento, todos con dos tipo de disparo diferentes. Las armas podremos ir recogi\u00e9ndolas de nuestros enemigos o bien encontrarlas por los enormes escenarios. \n\nEl juego se basa m\u00e1s que nada en disparar y acabar con todo lo que aparezca, avanzar e ir buscando pulsadores y palancas repartidos por los niveles para poder pasar al siguiente nivel. Hay multitud de caminos posibles a elegir, siendo bastante f\u00e1cil perdernos dada la extensi\u00f3n de los escenarios. Podemos visitar muchas zonas para conseguir objetos y armas ocultos o bien obviarlas para ir hacia el siguiente nivel. Hay varias formas de llegar a nuestros objetivos, el juego da mucha libertad y no es nada lineal, otro factor a destacar.\n\nLa IA enemiga es impresionante, pudiendo ver como nuestros enemigos nos rodean, huyen, se esconden, esquivan nuestros ataques, aparecen por la espalda, pelean entre ellos, etc.\n\n[h1]GR\u00c1FICOS:[/h1]\n\nEs sin duda el apartado m\u00e1s impresionante de Unreal. Ya desde la intro, que m\u00e1s bien parece una demo t\u00e9cnica, nos damos cuenta de las posibilidades que ofrece su motor gr\u00e1fico. Enormes escenarios, reflejos en el suelo (algo impensable por aquel entonces), el agua m\u00e1s realista jam\u00e1s vista hasta la fecha, el cielo, los efectos de luz, las sombras... es tan bello que dan ganas de quedarse mir\u00e1ndolo sin hacer nada.\n\nNada m\u00e1s empezar a jugar nos damos cuenta de que los escenarios interiores est\u00e1n llenos de detalles, con luces que nos deslumbran, efectos de niebla, rayos que iluminan el camino a su paso, sombras realistas, reflejo del entorno y del propio personaje en algunos suelos... simplemente impresionante, fue el top gr\u00e1fico de su \u00e9poca con una diferencia abismal sobre todo lo visto hasta la fecha. Otra cosa que sorpende es la interacci\u00f3n con el entorno, pudiendo destruir la gran mayr\u00eda de los objetos que aparecen en los escenarios, adem\u00e1s de forma muy realista para su \u00e9poca. \n\nTambi\u00e9n sorprendieron los escenarios exteriores, de una extensi\u00f3n enorme, llenos de detalles. En aquellos a\u00f1os no era muy com\u00fan ver escenarios exteriores de esas dimensiones, con extensiones de terreno muy grandes llenas de r\u00edos, cascadas, cielos muy detallados y realistas, fauna, vegetaci\u00f3n, fortificaciones, aldeas, castillos, naves, planetas, soles, etc. \n\nLas f\u00edsicas tambi\u00e9n destacaban para tratarse de un t\u00edtulo del a\u00f1o 98, todo estaba recreado y cuidado hasta el m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo detalle.\n\nEl dise\u00f1o de los enemigos est\u00e1 hecho con mucho mimo, pudiendo ver diferencias notorias dentro de una misma especie alien\u00edgena, distintos tama\u00f1os y armaduras, etc.\n\nOtro aspecto a destacar es el gore: desmembramientos, sangre que salpica en las paredes, decapitaciones, enemigos que intentan matarnos arrastr\u00e1ndose por el suelo a pesar de haberlos partido por la mitad...\n\n[h1]SONIDO:[/h1]\n\nEl sonido es otro aspecto sobresaliente en Unreal. Durante nuestra aventura podremos escuchar gritos a nuestro alrededor que nos mantendr\u00e1n en tensi\u00f3n, gru\u00f1idos de los alien\u00edgenas que nos acechan, los sonidos de la fauna del planeta Na-Pali, etc. Todo acompa\u00f1ado de una banda sonora excelente, muy variada y extensa que mejorar\u00e1 la experiencia en conjunto enormemente. \n\nMi lista de pros y contras: \n\n\nPROS:\n\n- Un cl\u00e1sico, todo amante de los shooters deber\u00eda jugarlo para conocer uno de los referentes dentro del g\u00e9nero\n\n- El origen del Unreal Engine, el motor gr\u00e1fico m\u00e1s popular y usado del mundo\n\n- Muy superior a Quake 2 a nivel t\u00e9cnico\n\n- Gr\u00e1ficamente el conjunto es ESPECTACULAR, no hab\u00eda nada igual en su \u00e9poca. A\u00fan a d\u00eda de hoy luce muy bien\n\n- El modo singleplayer es muy superior al de Quake 2\n\n- Escenarios gigantescos\n\n- Total libertad, 0 linealidad\n\n- El dise\u00f1o de los niveles: los castillos, fortalezas, los lugares ocultos, etc\n\n- Genial banda sonora, variada y muy extensa\n\n- El gore: Desmembramientos, decapitaciones, sangre en las paredes, etc\n\n- La nitidez de las texturas\n\n- F\u00edsicas son bastante buenas para la \u00e9poca\n\n- La enorme variedad de armamento, cada uno con su ataque secundario\n\n- El sonido: gritos, gru\u00f1idos, etc\n\n- Los efectos gr\u00e1ficos: la niebla, el impresionante efecto del agua, los efectos de luz, las sombras, los reflejos en el suelo, el cielo, el fuego, la forma de romperse de los objetos, las explosiones, las moscas sobre los cad\u00e1veres, etc\n\n- Es bastante largo (explorando los escenarios al m\u00e1ximo me ha durado m\u00e1s de 15h en dif\u00edcil y sin haber jugado a\u00fan la expansi\u00f3n Return To Napali)\n\n- Genial IA: los enemigos nos esquivan, huyen, se esconden, nos atacan por la espalda, pelean entre ellos... etc\n\n- Incluye la expansi\u00f3n \"Return to Na-Pali\"\n\n- Se puede encontrar bastante barato en las ofertas de Steam\n\n\nCONTRAS:\n\n- Es bastante f\u00e1cil perderse por los enormes escenarios\n\n- En el modo multiplayer no alcanza la calidad de Quake 2\n\n- Algunos fallos de clipping\n\n\n[h1]EXPANSI\u00d3N RETURN TO NA PALI:[/h1]\n\nPROS:\n\n- M\u00e1s horas de diversi\u00f3n\n\n- Nuevas armas\n\n- Nuevos enemigos\n\nCONTRAS:\n\n- M\u00e1s de lo mismo\n\n- Pocos a\u00f1adidos\n\n\nCONCLUSI\u00d3N:\n\nImprescindible si amas los shooters y quieres revivir uno de esos juegos que cambi\u00f3 el g\u00e9nero de los FPS.

I finally got around to restarting it recently, and my thoughts are as follows.\n\nGameplay-wise, Unreal is decent. It's an Old-School FPS, but it forgoes a lot of the trappings of the genre. A lot of the weapons don't fit into any of the usual FPS weapon categories (shotgun, machine gun, etc.), instead filling roles that they just made up on the spot. The default infinite-ammo pistol is actually quite useful, and it only gets better over the course of the game with the help of collectible upgrades (which I apparently missed, like, three of). Besides that, there's a solid variety of weapons, each with a clear and identifiable function (and an alternate fire, which is neat), and all of them feel pretty good to use. There's a lot of overlap with Unreal Tournament (including the Flak Cannon, God Among Firearms), although they all look different.\n\nOn the other side of the gunplay, the enemies can be goddamn annoying. They all have too much health, really hard-to-avoid AoE attacks, and/or frustratingly unpredictable dodges, and sometimes the game will just send a seemingly unlimited steam of them at you. One or two at a time is fine, but more than that feels like tossing ammo into a bottomless pit in the hopes that doing so for long enough will grant progress. The higher-level Skaarj in particular can get fucked.\n\nHowever, gameplay in Unreal takes a backseat to world-building, and that element of the game is noticeably better. It's really atmospheric, and everything seems weird, unsettling, vaguely hostile, and alien. Not just the alien planet that you're on, either\u2014that would be expected. Even your weird, hard-to-classify weapons seem like they don't belong, and you shouldn't be using them. The first level in particular, once you get out into the open air, makes you feel really vulnerable and unsafe, even though there aren't any enemies around. The game also plays with some ideas that Half-Life would use to greater effect later in the year, like friendly NPCs, areas with little to no combat, and seamless level transitions, and the way they make the world seem more real only makes the alien-ness more convincing and threatening. It's a wonderfully crafted atmosphere, and the game manages to more or less keep it up throughout.\n\nActually, both the gameplay and world-building take a backseat to the engine, because Unreal is primarily a tech demo for the now-ubiquitous Unreal Engine. It has some fairly impressive features for the time of its release, and it can't wait to show you its transparent water, colored lighting, and high polygon counts. Sometimes it gets a little obvious that certain areas exist only to show off engine capabilities, but mostly it's pretty innocuous. Early 3D physics are still annoying, though.\n\nUnreal also clearly wants to be Quake 2 so hard it burns inside. You have an infinite-ammo pistol instead of a melee weapon, there are blocks of text tacking goals onto your otherwise-meaningless button-pushing (without a use button), there's anger-inducingly mazy level design and no map, and overall the two games just feel very similar in a lot of ways.\n\nThe player character is female, which you don't really see enough in this genre. The fact that it completely doesn't matter and you can only tell if you look in a mirror or get injured reinforces my belief that developers should put more racial and gender diversity in FPS, because it doesn't hurt the game at all and more diversity is always nice.\n\nUnreal has a lot of issues, and I wouldn't say that it's an especially good game, but I almost never felt frustrated while playing it. The gameplay isn't that fun, and it's not memorable at all except when it's being dickish with the enemy distribution, but the atmosphere is good enough to make up for that. Overall, it's worth a purchase, but if you have to choose between this and its immediate sequel, head for the latter without hesitation.", "timestamp_created": 1493532524, "timestamp_updated":

As I understood, modding UE1 games is a great challenge because you need the exact version of the engine the game was compiled on + some of the developers were modifying the engine to have some extra features they wanted to see in their games, which means, I guess, that without any kind of reverse-engenering skills modifying the game is from hard to impossible, also the engine is proprietary.\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n- Shooting mechanics (it's kind of clunky, great variety of weapons, however after beating the game I didn't manage to figure out the purpose of each weapon (if they even have any or just designed for the player to have a wide choice)\n- Enemy design (the whole pool of the enemies didn't bring anything new to the genre, there are a lot of the enemies with the basic patterns just for the diversity, even from the point of 1997 there was nothing really new to it).\n- Rare change of the pace (for me means that the game is a little bit monotonous, however that happens sometimes (Serpent Canyon and etc))\n- Boss fights (Just shoot it till it dies, pure boredom)\n- Some levels (near the end of the game) took me a lot of time because of running in circles, trying to understand where to go.\n\nTo sum up, this is a great demo for Unreal engine, especially for its time, also the game without any kind of huge letdowns. For the best experience I would recommend to play on easy or something like that, because I don't really feel like this can be a really interesting and challenging experience from the point of the actual game mechanics today. Was kind of a chore to finish the game, though the first part felt great for some reason, maybe it gets repetetive really quick. 7.5", "timestamp_created": 1490289136, "timestamp_updated": 1490480883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486700", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30633432": {"recommendationid": "30633432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181789178", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506432814}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0437\u0443 \u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438 \n+\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0430\n+\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u043a\u0438 (\u043e\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u043c\u044b\u0448\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f)\n+\u0423\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0433\u0438\n+\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0438 (\u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u0437 \u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0441 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u0448\u044c\n-\u041d\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 (\u043b\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430)\n-\u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0443 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0434\u043b\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f (\u043d\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0438\u0435)\n-\u043d\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0437\u044f \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0448\u043e\u0442\u044b (\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0436\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u043a\u043d\u043e\u043f\u043a\u0443 \u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043d \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439)\n\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043a\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0441 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0439", "timestamp_created": 1490009951, "timestamp_updated": 1490009951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502439", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30536244": {"recommendationid": "30536244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276987293", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "last_played": 1515702126}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright, i've been putting off this review for quite some time. For those of you who don't know, this is called Unreal Gold because it's a 'deluxe edition' if you want to call it that. The actual game is called Unreal, but it comes with the expansion \"Return to Na Pali\" and is kind of like a sequel. I would recomend getting this game on sale, i'm not saying it's bad, this is one of my favorite games, it's just that the price seems a little too high. On sale it goes for at least $3, i got the Unreal Deal Pack for $5 during the Winter sale, I couldn't imagine how cheap it would be on the Summer sale. Anyways, this game is similar to Half-Life, so if you enjoy that game, this is a must buy. I will warn you that this game gets a little dark. By that, I mean hard to see. I don't want to explain too much before you get it, because going into it knowing nothing is the most immersive way to play this game. It can start a little rough, but keep going, you will thank yourself later. Multiplayer also works still, and this game is lots of fun with friends.\n\nSo in a nutshell, buy it, and if you're unsure, wait for a sale.

This review is based heavily on the CD ROM and GOG.com (DRM-free) releases of Unreal Gold. So my Steam time with Unreal doesn't even come close to my experience with this time-tested classic.\n\nWhile Unreal Tournament gets damn near all the spot light for Epic, and understandably so, it really started as an add-on for Unreal. Unreal Tournament was originally an expansion for the, admittedly weak, multiplayer component of Unreal. However, Unreal's single player core game is phenominal. In fact, the core mechanics, graphics engine, and weapon functions that made Unreal Tournament a masterpiece were first introduced in Unreal.\n\nUnreal's single player experience has aged like the finest of wines. The minimalist story practically tells itself via the environment. The atmosphere draws the player into a fully realized world. The music sets the mood for much of what's going on, and even drops out altogether at some points allowing a vaccuum to add tension or calm. While the graphics definitely show their age, they get the job done and almost lend a \"vintage\" feel to a game from a ground breaking era. In single player, Unreal is neck-and-neck with Quake.\n\nIn this era of dumbed down, \"hyper realistic\" military themed FPSes with tacked on single player campaigns, I've grown to appreciate Unreal Gold more than ever.", "timestamp_created": 1486456394, "timestamp_updated": 1486456394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615160", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29731587": {"recommendationid": "29731587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198224605628", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486338117}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is not playable.

It truly was groundbreaking at its release back in 1998 and it really set the foundations for games for the next millenium. Except for mouse acceleration (which I believe can be fixed by a mod? I don't know), the gameplay still holds up compared to modern games. Most enemies are able to dodge projectiles quite well and never stand still. Some of them even use a variety of weapons too. Every single weapon and item you pick up is still useable up to the very end of the game, and the game doesn't hold your hand and take you to your destination; you have to figure out where to go and what to do all by yourself.\n\nAll of the levels look incredible - to vast caverns and plains, dangerous cliffs and ancient alien temples with familiar yet weird and fantastic architecture filled with intricate hallways, and futuristic spaceships, with a unique soundtrack to go with it. However if you're looking for more of a \"cinematic\" experience, this game doesn't have it. Story is mostly told through your personal experience and observations from simply playing the game and through journals that you pick up. Proper characters and dialogue are not present at all.\n\nI want everyone to experience this game because It truly is a great game that every FPS fan deserves to play.

The look is different. The feel is different. And what gives Unreal an edge is how these differences, while not always positive, distinguish it from the legions of other 3D shooters. In Unreal, you are a prisoner aboard a ship en route to a penal colony. The ship crashes on a mysterious planet where the mystical Nali race is being subjugated by the cruel and technologically advanced Skaarj. As far as the game itself is concerned, the graphics are incredible. Today he is no longer glorious, but in his time it was the perfect engine used. Of course, they can download texture pack. \n\nOne of Unreal's best features is the enemy AI. In other games, the logic of certain creature actions seems to be linear and undefined. In Unreal, each opponent attacks with his own style, using a combination of melee and ranged attacks. In its time this game had a great potencial. Unreal is a truly great single-player game.[/b]\n\n[i]In the game you will find a lot of secret hiding places and levels. Which will reward you with simple equipment, ammunition or story. In his time, perhaps the best action game. With the best AI. It was even the first game to change music according to the situation.

El a\u00f1o pasado fue Dead Space y Stalker, y este a\u00f1o le toc\u00f3 a Unreal. Unreal fue una saga muy conocida por los Unreal Tournament en la \u00e9poca de los cyber. Yo recuerdo con gran cari\u00f1o la fase de las dos torres, aunque hab\u00eda muchas m\u00e1s. Por desgracia este \u00e9xito fue el que luego la hizo desaparecer. El juego segu\u00eda el esquema de los primeros Doom, un escenario abierto y que el usuario fuera explorando y matando, pero esta vez tendr\u00eda una IA muy buena, y un aspecto gr\u00e1fico \u00e9pico. Otro detalle muy chulo en la \u00e9poca, era los personajes que te pod\u00edan ayudar y la posibilidad de ver escenarios sin enemigos, s\u00f3lo explorar y explorar. El argumento del juego es muy simple, eres un prisionero que escapa de la c\u00e1rcel y vas a acabar a un planeta esclavizado por unos seres muy chungos. Tu intentar\u00e1s salvar tu vida y de paso, a los seres del planeta. El argumento me recuerda mucho a las pel\u00edculas de los a\u00f1os 60-80, en especial por el final. Como es la versi\u00f3n Gold, el juego trae la expansi\u00f3n Return to Na Pali cuyo argumento os lo dejo a vosotros, y que en el juego no aporta mucho m\u00e1s. Entrando en analizar el juego... pues lo normal ser\u00eda decir que ha envejecido muy mal y dem\u00e1s al ser del 1998 (N64/DC), pero yo creo que esto no es as\u00ed. El juego muestra una IA y un dise\u00f1o de fases que bien les gustar\u00eda tener a los juegos actuales (2016), y si bien el motor est\u00e1 desfasado, muestras luces y ciertos efectos muy punteros para la \u00e9poca.

with it. I looked at it without much interest and said \"what the hey, I'll give it a go\".\n\nI AM SO GLAD I DID.\n\nThe Pros:\n+ The level design is mind boggling. The developers put an excruciating amount of detail into each level (of which there are quite a lot). While progression is linear, the maps are so big and complex with lots of secrets to find that it feels like a first person exploration game at times.\n+The soundtrack is beautiful. there are a full 3 hours of full game soundtrack, and each level gets its own unique track. Its too bad that the OST isnt included as a downloadable DLC with this game.\n+The gun play in this game is what spawned the rise of Unreal Tournament. It's tight, It's fast paced, It's intense, no BS.\n\nThe Mehs:\n=There's not much to the story, and what there is can only be found out through data logs left behind by dead crew members or through translations of alien text. The story in the Return to Na Pali expansion is better explained as it gets actual voice acting.\n\nThe Cons:\n-Wonky things start to happen if you try to run this game higher than its native resolution of 800x600.

Levels range from enclosed to outdoor and many intermediate areas inbetween and I obviously encourage anyone to buy Unreal. This version of Unreal (Unreal Gold) comes equipped with the official expansion pack - Return to Na Pali. I don't think return to na pali is quite as good and as long as the main game, but it is still a relatively decent experience none the less.\n\nWhat I mainly like about Unreal is the extensive content creation capabilities, you can basically create new anything with this game such as worlds/maps, models, skins, textures, sounds, weapons, items, music and mods as the game comes packed with the developer tools, which have been expanded upon with the 227 patch, which also fixes almost every issue with the game, improves performance, adds new capabilities for content creation, adds new tech (such as character shadows) and some supplementary new effects. The patch, created with the permission of Epic games, can be found in the downloads section of www.oldunreal.com , it is sort of compulsary to obtain and install the patch otherwise multiplayer is inaccessable since the gamespy shut down (which shut down the gamespy master servers for multiplayer games), and the patch also updates Unreal to connect to the new masterserver. Multiplayer also allows a hotlink to custom created content, which can be downloaded from that server on the spot simply by connecting to it, over Unreal itself. This means it is very easy to create custom content and share it just by adding it to your server, this is a feature that alot of games from this era (including most games in the current generation) do not have, as usually mods for such games must be downloaded outside of the game + placed and configured in the correct folders, which then afterwoods you can connect to a server if you have done all that correctly, unlike Unreal which downloads everything over the game just by connecting to a server, and runs it from the cache + is already configured.\n\nThe 227 patch is actively updated, so new iterations of the patch will come out subsequently, adding more capabilities and more features.\n\nIf you haven't experienced Unreal yet, I urge you to. It's always nice to see new faces in the community!\n\nEdit : Also nominated Unreal Gold for the 'Test of Time' steam award.", "timestamp_created": 1478536780, "timestamp_updated": 1480181409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677121", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26464173": {"recommendationid": "26464173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122510715", "num_games_owned": 428, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478464835}, "language": "english", "review": "The way I would describe this game is a mark of the transistion between games like Quake and Doom into games like Half-Life, and it's great. The levels are large and open with enemies that will actually dodge your attacks. Most if not all enemies (I might be forgetting one or two) fire projectiles that you can dodge out of the way of. There's an average amount of weapons for a game like this, but each gun has multiple firing modes, from the option of using the projectile firing machine gun as just that or using it as a shotgun, to the rocket/grenade launcher that you can charge up to fire multiple rockets/grenades at once.

Na Pali is a beautiful place to explore, especially were there is lots of vegetation and waterfalls. There are levels were you can explore space ships, native villages and ancient temples. The game still looks good today. \n\u2022\tInteresting story.   \n\u2022\tAwesome soundtrack, especially at the beginning.  \n\u2022\tPlenty of secrets to be found, some are hidden in quite clever places. \n\u2022\tA great selection of weapons. My favourite weapons were the Stinger and the ASMO. \n\u2022\tAs you shoot your way through the levels you will come across things like PDA's, Diary's and over things, you will able to find out what a particular person was doing before they died or find out some useful information.\n\u2022\tIntelligent A.I. Some of the enemies are hard to kill because of there agility. \n\u2022\tThe expansion pack has new weapons and enemies.        \n\n[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u]\n\n\u2022\t I wish the player had a permanent flashlight, one in which recharges, instead of having to keep finding flares and flashlights throughout the game. I had to fire my gun to light up some areas in the game.  \n\u2022\tI didn't find the power ups very useful. I very rarely used them.\n\u2022\tThe game can be confusing sometimes. I got stuck a couple of times not knowing were to go or what to do.   \n\n\n[u]Conclusion[/u] \n\nI really enjoyed Unreal, like I said very impressive level design. It's a beautiful world to explore.

Fight your way through tough enemies that can appear from anywhere just to find out what happened to the rest of the crew and what your options for survival are.  As you progress through the world you learn more about what happened to everyone and how far they made it, what happened to the planet natives, and who the alien invaders are and what they want.  Gather new weapons and discover the right tool for the job as you face new and bigger enemies.  You'll quickly find out that some weapons have the ability to completely explode an enemy, sending body parts flying and bouncing with a trail of blood, while others can sever limbs with the same outcome.\n\nWhen you finish the game and discover your final outcome you have the pleasure of going back and playing again on harder difficulties.  Harder difficulties not only make the enemies stronger and your weapons weaker, the enemies are faster, come in greater numbers, and (my favorite) they become SMARTER.  Smarter, meaning they hide, ambush, fake their deaths, and mislead you down the wrong path.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect is much appreciated.  Play online (if the servers are still running) or go against the computer in a botmatch and make the match you want to play, with maps inspired by levels from the main story.\n\nBuilt back in 1998 on the brand-new Unreal Engine the game takes your breath away with amazing detail and a breath-taking score to compliment the variety of environments throughout the game.  Customize your controls with action-mapping and fine-tuning sensitivity, while also changing the HUD to need your desired style.\n\nThe only downside to this game is the lack of detail and textures when you get up close to an object or environment wall.  According to an interview with developers, this was the result of a time and budget constraint.  Just imagine what they could have accomplished without those constraints and how different our games would be today.  Many games and development companies use a variant of the original Unreal Engine, such as Battlefield, Borderlands, Life is Strange, Duke Nukem Forever, BioShock, Dirty Bomb, and many, many, many more.\n\nI originally got this game not long after it came out and was blown away by everything and immediately fell in love with it.

Of the first person shooters I've played, this one is way better than most. The amazingly rich environments suck you deep into the plight of the peaceful Nali and the cruel world of their oppressors. When you awaken in your cell, you are alone, the bodies of your shipmates bloodied and lifeless. Many are torn in two. Sirens and garbled voice recordings break the uneasy silence, as you crawl through the battered remains of the ship, only to find that you are the sole survivor, lost on a planet full of hostile beings intent on your demise. That is only the beginning, though. Your travels to escape the planet will lead you through many varied locations that are very easy to differentiate from one another, each one more visually stunning than the last. That is definately one of Unreal's strong points. \nThe brilliant designers do not allow for the levels to become tediously repetitive. Each environment has it's own personality. Another strong point, and perhaps most important, is the enemy. Long gone are the days of Doom when enemies would simply stand their ground, and trade fire with you. These enemies are much more cunning than that. They will use cover, snipe at you from high perches, duck fire, dodge and even call for back-up if neccessary. Some of your enemies will even try to draw you into traps and ambushes. \nThis game is exceptionally challenging and rewarding, making most shooters pale in comparison. I was most impressed with the dramatic lighting, ambient sound and music, utilized to it's full potential, making this lengthy epic bristle with life and tension. This is an ideal purchase for anyone who does'nt already have this classic in their library. You can take or leave the included expansion pack, as it simply doesn't offer much more variety to the original experience, but don't over-look this title due to it's now ridiculously low price.

awe of this game as a kid, especially when I went into my local CEX and they had a dozen PC's running the demo on a loop. The graphics were at the time genuinely amazing. However if I remember back a bit harder I also remember never finishing it, and playing it again now I'm not the least bit surprised.\n\nThe level design is poor. If you're of the opinion that the mid - late 90's was the golden age of level design and has subsequently gone downhill then comparing to something contemporary like quake the level design is doubly poor. Storytelling breaks the golden rule of \"show don't tell\" by being accoumplished through innumerable, slightly-awkward-to-access message dialogues. Enemies are wooden and moronic (again compare to quake, or even doom,) and with the notable exception 1 or 2 well loved weapons (read: flak cannon) these is absolutely nothing here beyond a cookie-cutter shooter. Albeit one that happened to look very pretty at the time.\n\nThe whole thing could written off as a glorified tech demo, and unsurprisingly that's what the name \"unreal\" has come to mean to most gamers, it's an engine, not a game.\n\nAdd into the mix the usual retro-gaming bug bears such as no auto save or widescreen support, awkward default key-binds and proprietary surround sound and you have an experience that IMHO it isn't worth going back to.

Also, whilst it starts of very good, it starts to become too repetitive (unlike Quake 2, for example), and the last level is just horrible in my opinion. However, there are some nice puzzles, and I liked it most of the way into it, however it just became a chore to complete it for the sake of it.\nIf the Unreal bundle is about \u00a35 then give it a try, as there's still people playing UT, UT2005 and UT3 (if you can get multiplayer to work), so it forms a fair bundle of single and multiplayer games.

Unreal is a beautiful game and not just visually, the lore, music and atmosphere are superb. Enemies are as diveres as the locations you will be exploring, you start off in a prison ship and quickly move onto a mineshaft, a castle, an arena and run down villiages the locals used to live in.\nThe ship transporting you has crashed into the alien planet inhabited by the Nali, a peacful race that only wants to help you in your quest. Their planet has been over run by Imperialistic Skaarj, a powerful reptilian race wanting only to harvest the Nali homeworld for reasources and will kill anything in their way (i.e. you). \nUnreal is a big game, my first playthrough was around 12+ hours, and thats on the highest difficulty which i 100% recommend to play on, it is so much more satisfying when you beat this game on the highest difficulty. \nAs i said before the atmosphere is awesome, there will be times where everything goes silent, your health is low, you are in complete darkness and the flash light is running out of power, and just the idea that there may be an enemy around the corner is absoluty terrifying. Im not going to lie, there have been times where these damn spider like enemies jump out of the wall and i have jumped at the mere hiss they make. \nThere has been times where i have gotten stuck but I will just take a break and come back to it later and the answer will be so obvious that i wonder why i didn't think of it before. There are also countless walkthroughs to help you get out of pickles.\nUnreal also has botmatches which are always fun to play, and if you have played Unreal tournament '99 then you will see a lot of familiar maps. \nThe only thing that i can think of that i didnt like was dying and finding that i didn't save and since it is an old game there is no auto save so it completely your fault if you forget to save.

It also uses the menu from Unreal Tournament, rather than the one from the Unreal disc version.\n\nToday, Unreal could almost be called a hidden gem. It was big back in 1998, but over the years it has somewhat faded into obscurity, at least compared to games like Doom and Quake, which are still widely known and popular. Perhaps this is because Half-Life, a great, but in my opinion inferior game, released at the same time and received vastly more media coverage. Or because the multiplayer version, Unreal Tournament, would become the flagship of Epic Games.\n\nUnreal remains one of the very best single-player FPS to this day. The gameplay could be described as an in-between mix of action-packed shooting (Quake) and atmospheric exploration (S.T.A.L.K.E.R.). The shooting isn't quite as polished and fleshed out as in the id games, but the leveldesign is top-notch. Together with the great music, it creates an immersive atmosphere that's rarely seen in games. Unreal will lead you through so many unique and memorable places over the course of the campaign that it's hard to list them all. You'll explore ancient temples, and it will make you feel as if you were Indiana Jones. You'll also make your way through the decks of a crashed spaceship, and you'll feel just like Ellen Ripley. Add a village in the sky here, an alien mothership there, the leveldesign will take you from one highlight to another.\n\nThe arsenal consists of ten weapons and, seeing as this is an older game, you can carry them all. All weapons have two fire modes, while some have additional depth to them, such as the ASMD that can do combos or the 8ball that can load up to six rockets or grenades at once and fire either spread out or close together and even lock on enemies to fire heat-seeking rockets.\nAll weapons are different from one another, most are interesting and innovative. Unfortunately, they are not balanced. Different weapons have different strengths and weaknesses, but some are outright better than others. The Flak Cannon is a strong counter for the quick and aggressive enemies that like to engage the player in melee combat, and will be your preferred weapon for most encounters as long as you have enough ammo. The more powerful hitscan weapons also pack a good punch and are overall strong and versatile. The most common enemy creature in the game, the Skaarj, is agile and very good at dodging, which makes it a real challenge to inflict meaningful damage with weapons that fire projectiles. Those weapons tend to become easily replaced as your arsenal grows.\n\nUnreal pits you against a number of enemies, from small insects to huge monsters. They really fit into the world and make you believe as if those creatures are actually living there, and not just random mobs placed into the maps by the leveldesigner. Most enemies are distinctively different from one another and require different tactics and weapons to defeat. Each level usually has a prevalent enemy type that makes up most of the population in that area, while the other, general types will take more of a backseat but are still there. The Skaarj, which you'll see throughout the game, come in about a dozen variations with varying stats and skins. Noteable is an AI that is impressive even today, almost two decades later. The pathfinding may let enemies find you even from far away through terrain that is difficult to navigate. Most enemies are reckless when at full health, and cautious when injured. Their ability to lead with projectiles as well as Skaarj's mobility and agility make for a formidable challenge on higher difficulties.\n\nUnreal does have multiplayer, though it's probably hard to find online games after all these years. The multiplayer always seemed to lack [i]something[/i] that ended up making it feel unfinished, though I could never point out exactly what that was. Perhaps it's the weapons which are designed to slay monsters, though they are still potent and perfectly capable of fragging players once you get good at the game. If you want to give multiplayer a more serious try, I'd suggest checking out Unreal Tournament, what's basically a polished version of the multiplayer released as a new game, and the best of its kind only challenged by Quake 3 Arena.\nIt's also possible to play with bots, and they give inexperienced players a good run for their money. Filling DmFith, DmHealPod or DmMorbias with 16 bots and just reveling in the carnage it would unfold kept me entertained for hours on end in a time when internet access wasn't readily available. It's definitely worth checking out.\n\nI'd also like to mention that, on a technical level, Unreal could quite possibly be [i]the[/i] most impressive game relative to release date, which makes a worthy history lession second only to Wolfenstein 3D. And if you had a 3dfx Voodoo card in 1998 you know exactly why. We were used to playing Duke3D and Quake when Unreal came along with its colored lightning, reflective surfaces, glow effects, volumetric lightning, and and and... it was eyecandy on a level that put Crysis to shame. Even the AI was and still is amazing, only really outdone by F.E.A.R.. And yet Unreal is more than a simple tech demo. It's actually a good game, solid in every aspect. And the first game that earned the right to call itself a \"Quake killer\". Did it kill Quake? No, but the attempt was more than respectable.\n\nIf you like FPS, you'll love Unreal. It's one of the best single-player FPS ever made, and a must-play for any shooting enthusiast. Its leveldesign, music, graphics and AI raised the bar in 1998 and still hold up today.", "timestamp_created": 1466968969, "timestamp_updated": 1487253258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.763649", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23797059": {"recommendationid": "23797059", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043603583", "num_games_owned": 484, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502481656}, "language": "english", "review": "God I miss games like this.

I only had gotten the game a few years ago, as an idle curiousity to see the roots of Unreal Engine. I didn't manage to play through the main game the first time, those years ago, but more recently, I had the chance here. I got the OldUnreal patches and everything for the copy here on Steam, which I'm using through family sharing, and this game, this game is fucking amazing. The gameplay is extremely quick and fluid, with a lot of polish for such an old game. Even better, uncapped framerates with custom renderer support, an FOV slider (Although it's easier to control in the .ini file, and also labled Widescreen adjust), and so many cool weapons. Every weapon feels great to use, the sounds have punchiness, the music puts you in a groove, and best of all, it's so much fun. While the game is fast paced, it also has loads of puzzles, nonlinear level designs, and I can't name a single thing it does wrong beside the slightest, tiniest bit of audio crackling in the music. You can only hear it if you're really, really looking for it though.\n\nOh, and the environments are so vast, that I can't help but feel that they're just gorgeous, despite being low res and low poly.\n\nSo, in recap, Unreal does all of these right:\nWeapons\nAudio\nEnvironmental Audio\nMUSIC\nInteresting Enemy Design\nInteresting Levels\nLevels that make you go \"woah\"\nMUSIC\nAnd

Both are very enjoyable and nice to come back to every now and again.\n\nAs a child, I mostly did botmatches because they were so much fun! There were a variety of gamemodes, weapons, and maps (Radikus and Tundra being my favorites). The gameplay is pretty fast paced, which keeps every match interesting.\n\nIn regards to the singleplayer, it is sort of a \"figure out where to go by yourself\" sort of campaign. I don't know too much of the story, but all I know is that you crash land on a planet and you were apparently a prisoner of some kind.\n\nPlus, the online mode is STILL FUCKING FUNCTIONAL. Holy Jesus this blew my mind when I tried it for the first time. Some servers have mods that change the gameplay entirely, or give you new weapons to toy with. It definitely was worth waiting a minute or so.\n\nIn conclusion, if you like aliens, fast paced combat, O.P bazookas, nostalgic environments and violence up the wazzoo, get this game.

To this day it haunts my dreams with it's large open maps, complex level design, and stunning graphics (for its time). You can't go wrong if you are into older FPS games and this game has always stood out and been unique.\n\nThis particular Edition comes with the Return to Na Pali expansion (Which is lower quality imho, but it's still worth a playthrough.)\n\nIt features a lot of pretty unique weapons, all designed to show off different aspects of what the engine could do, and they end up being so different that it's actually refreshing. The levels and environments are also varied and interesting. Some of the levels in this game are seriously impressive (I'm looking at you, sunspire). The game is still pretty damn pleasing to look at as well, despite it's lack of polygons and lower res textures, the level design really makes great use of the engine and puts a lot of other 3D shooters of the day to shame.\n\nWhere I feel this game really excels above all else, is it's music. It has some of the best video game music I've ever had the pleasure of hearing. Seriously it's an amazing soundtrack, check it out, especially if you like Alexander Brandon.\n\nThe game does have a story, but  it's not shoved down your throat. Instead it's told through a universal translator item you obtain near the start of the game, it will pick up various messages from dead bodies, books, computer terminals, and can be read to learn about the world and characters in it. The translator also often tells you what a switch does or provides important clues to progressing (This game can be a bit troublesome to navigate compared to most of the linear games we get these days). \n\nReturn to Na Pali actually has some \"cutscenes\" that are basically monologue of the main character over a section of the map, these can be skipped and some of them weren't even working for my last playthrough.\n\nSo now for the downside, this game has some crashing problems, and by some, I mean a lot! There is a good community made patch that you really should seek out before playing, as it removes a vast majority of the crashes.\n\ntl;dr: Awesome and unique FPS with a lot of variety in weapons and environments and some of the best music I've ever heard.", "timestamp_created": 1459754092, "timestamp_updated": 1474279376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556290", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22209663": {"recommendationid": "22209663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104321350", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439358438}, "language": "english", "review": "I used to play this game when I was younger and absolutely LOVED it.

Unreal Gold is an updated version of Unreal, which was released in 1998 among other FPS classics. Unreal is pretty much what happened when Epic Games looked at Quake 2 and said \"Yeah that's good and all, but what if we did that, with awesome graphics (for the time), exelent lighting, a unique weapon lineup, and an amazing soundtrack?\" And from that, Unreal was born. In Unreal, you go around from map to map (which are generally really huge), fighting an alien race known as the Skarjj, while occasionally helping out another alien race known as the Nali. Unreal has amazing variety in the themes of levels, one minute you're in a crashed prison ship, the next you're in a mountain area, and then the next you're in a mine, and it keeps going on, introducing new and varied areas. Unreal also has an amazing soundtrack, who it's composer would later work on games like Deus Ex. I love the soundtrack in this game, as it has inspired other soundtracks from games that arn't even in the same genre (Freedom Planet for example). The graphics have aged decently. While the texture quality and low poly enviorments and NPCs look bad by today's standards, the lighting in this game is absolutely amazing, and puts other games with great lighting like System Shock 2 to shame. Unreal also has AI which is extremely impressive, even to this day, that almost moves around like another player at times. Unreal's biggest strength however, lies in it's unique weapon lineup, which inclueds the Upgradable Energy Pistol, The Razorjack, The Bio Launcher, and The Flak Cannon to name a few of the awesome weapons. If I had to choose a favorite weapon, it would probably be the Flak Cannon, as it gives a satisfying punch to when you shoot an enemy at point blank. I don't have too many problems with this game to be honest. If I had to nitpick any problems, it would probably be that you do move a bit too slow for my liking, and that sometimes these maps can be extremely confusing to first time players. I also really didn't like the Return To Na Pali expansion included, as many of the changes made to it break the fundamentals of Unreal, and it just doesn't hold up too well. If you like old school FPS games, then Unreal Gold is a game that you should play before you die. I highly reccomend patching the game with The OId Unreal patch, that fixes many bugs the game had, and allows you to run the game in modern resolutions. It's completely Unreal that a first person shooter like is this awesome. If you're a fan of Old School first person shooters, or even FPS games in general, then I reccomend you check this one out.

Sadly this game has aged about as well as the original quake. I.e. Not very well. THe graphics are still pretty nice but the lack of variance in scenarios and interations  leaves one feeling a bit fatigued after a while. There is little room, reason or reward for the stealthy approach and everything but The Nali want to kill you.\n\n[b]PROS[/b]\n- Good graphics\n- Polished mechanics\n- Good level design.\n\n This game was a little ahead of its time and does a wonderful job of creating the feeling of a big m interconnected world. It certainly beats Half-Life in so far as the variety of the locations. It's a pity they feel so sterile.\n\n\n[b]CONS[/b]\n- Poor pacing\n- Visceral satisfaction is low.\n- The Na'li\n\nVisceral satisfaction is a weird thing. You know like how in DOOm you never seem to get tired of liquifying a bunch of imps.  Yeah.. Nothing like that here. I seldom if ever found felt satisfied after beating a mini boss or enemy rush. Relieved. , yes. But never satisfied. The fights and enemies are just a bit too annoying. I found greater satisfaction in completing the environmental challenges than I did the combat.\n\nThen there's the Na'li. Every time you see one of these suicidal gits your heart will sink because they are just so  helpful. They will often unlock secret and otherwise inaccessible rooms with nice items and they are so eager to do it they klose all survival instincts.  Get too close and they will begin to run pell mell for theyr stash and invariably right into a group of enemies that are a;ll to happy to kill them. Unless you generously run ahead and absorb the attacks with your sturdy organs.. So every time these guys show iup you're in for an escort mission at high speed. If you're lucky you can snheak around the Na'li, run ahead and clear out the enemnies  before triggering the sprint but other times you have no choice but to try your best to sprint ahead and absorb bullets.\n\nHonestly it is a good game but I can see why Half-Life and Quake surpassed it as far as siingle player and narrative.", "timestamp_created": 1457606761, "timestamp_updated": 1510533398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21575471": {"recommendationid": "21575471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063978878", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457233477}, "language": "english", "review": "A classic \"must play\" that still plays really well!\n\nIf ever there was a game to remake with the new Unreal engine....", "timestamp_created": 1456879633, "timestamp_updated": 1456879633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567086", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21504287": {"recommendationid": "21504287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205719515", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456110278}, "language": "english", "review": "In 1998, Epic Games brought us the original Unreal. The game was unlike anything PC gamers had seen before, it had innovative weapons, beautiful graphics (for the time), and a very complex story that some people thought was boring, while others found it worthy of a literature adaptation. But with Unreal Gold, you can experince this game in the way it was truly ment to be played. This package not only contains a slightly modified version of the original 1998 game, but it also contains an expansion pack that practically continues the story of the original Unreal game, this expansion pack goes by the name of The Return to Na Pali. In all seriousness The Return to Na Pali is a really good expansion pack (albeit shorter than the original game) that contains new weapons, enemies, and levels (obviously). I must warn you that the original Unreal and The Return to Na Pali are quite possibly the hardest FPS games you will ever play in your life. Seriously, there were some levels in these games in which I died more than 10 times.  But don't let the difficulty scare you, Unreal Gold is a compilation that every FPS game fan should have in their possesion. This compilation is totally......UNREAL!!!!  P.S.

It was one of the earliest forms of awe I can recall when I was navigating through the wreckage of the prison ship and going outside onto an alien planet to confront brutes and skaarj and all the other nasty crap. The story was pretty neat, the graphics, at the time, were awesome. The mechanics were, and still are, pretty solid. This series, including the follow up Unreal Tournament, were easily one of my favorite games to play as a child and experiencing it again as an adult took me down nostalgia avenue and socked me right in the feels. \n\nThe action, again, feels smooth and the fights all feel pretty visceral as you blow your enemies to chunks. The environment is as much fun to look at as it is deadly because among being a great FPS it's also got some decent platformer elements combined with some slight puzzle solving areas. Keep in mind none of this is really too difficult but some secret areas can be accessed for more loot or plasma pistol upgrades which really go a long way to making the end game less difficult. As you go through the levels you will find data pads or letters or messages that sort of reveal parts of the story as well as adding some depth to some of the weird scenes you come across. Bodies laying around a room full of guns or some lone crates with chunks of what used to be people beside it tell a story which really adds a lot of immersion to your playthrough.\n\nMy only real issue with the game is that some of the graphical settings don't seem to really work but this could just be my machine. Brightness and screen size seem to be constant issues. The only setting that seems to work without issues is 800x600 which is fine, but since I can't really adjust the brigthness level and it seems too dark.

Najbardziej oczywisty to grafika, kt\u00f3ra w tamtych czasach wyciska\u0142a wszystkie soki z \u00f3wczesnych komputer\u00f3w. Po drugie to klimat. Na ten aspekt sk\u0142ada\u0142o si\u0119 te\u017c kilka czynnik\u00f3w. Po pierwsze to projekty poziom\u00f3w ze szczeg\u00f3lnym uwzgl\u0119dnieniem du\u017cych otwartych lokacji.

The AI in Unreal and Unreal Tournament 1999 is very advanced, as they become better at dodging rockets and predicting your own movements, which means they'll aim their rockets and other projectiles not directly at you (at least not 100% of the time), but where you're headed, with surprising accuracy. The AI is actually better than most people I've seen play FPSs, and not because their accuracy and HP stats were raised 200% like most games. You, as the player, are also able to use agile dodging moves like the enemies you face. Because of this, and the fact the levels are very large with plenty of secret areas to explore, and a ton of inventory items and weapons to find, Unreal is very fun to play. The graphics are great, and the music is, too. It has most of the same composers as Deus Ex and Unreal Tournament 1999 (obviously).\nIf you're one of the people who likes a bit of story in their games, Unreal offers a lot of that in the form of a universal translator the player can use to read alien texts and carvings, while also reading the diaries of humans also stranded on the planet you're on.\n\nMusic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xMp0fZiJaM\n\nOverall, the game is excellent, and for the $10 price tag, you'd be silly not to pick it up.", "timestamp_created": 1453004410, "timestamp_updated": 1453004410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20567049": {"recommendationid": "20567049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120780532", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452969228}, "language": "english", "review": "holy sh*t was this a good game.

This game stands heads and shoulders above all other shooters with a believeable and intriguing world, easily some of the best design in gaming history, incredible sound design with a killer soundtrack and some seriously fantastic visuals that more than hold up 20 years later.\n\n[b]The Great[/b]:\n++Not only did this look visually stunning for the year in contrast to everything else, as well as introducing an engine that would go to run some of the best games ever released (i.e. Deus Ex, UT99, Rune) the game looks fantastic today with some really impressive lighting and colourful landscapes.\n++Alexander Brandon and Michiel van den Bos' work on the soundtrack is honestly half of the game. The music provides such an incredibly otherworldy atmosphere and provides some of the best music ever heard in a video game. No exaggeration.\n++The sound design is rivaled only by Thief the Dark Project when it was released. Mixed with OpenAL, it adds to some really believable environments with realistic high quality sounds that suit the games atmosphere.\n++Unreal's multiplayer may have been made redundant by Unreal Tournament but the game features some great experimental maps and includes bots, which were very uncommon for a PC shooter back in the day as well as lots of options and game modes.\n++There's a reason the weapon array of this game has gone largely unchanged through every iteration of the series, including the latest released in progress since 2014. The weapon array is probably the best I've ever had the joy of using. Every single weapon is useful and each one suits a given task but not only that, the sound design offers some meaty feeling weapons on the more realistic side but also makes the more sci-fi weapons feel great and bassy. These weapons were entirely original as well. The majority of these weapons are stuff you really just won't find anywhere else.\n++The level design is this games biggest strength. The utterly gigantic expanses of land and breath-taking views and vista's add to the feeling that you really are on a foreign planet. Everything is so interesting\n++This game has a pretty unique way of handling story providing most of it through your handy translator. This provides back-story as well as information on how to continue your journey in a believable way. The game is also one of the few I've played that is entirely seamless. It feels like a journey from start to finish and everything connects naturally.\n++Enemy design is interesting and thoroughly varied. This game also boasts to having some of the best AI ever, and to this day, that's still true.\n\n[b]The Good[/b]:\n+The games engine holds up well on modern PC's as long as you use DirectX9. Getting the fan-made 227i patch also helps as well allowing high resolutions and a FOV slider, as well as a bug list too numerous to mention, and more.\n+The game is long, really, really long. This isn't a bad thing because the pacing is so fantastic and the gameplay is so refined you'll never feel bored. This is actually a big strength. It also means lots of replayability.\n+Multiplayer options are great and online multiplayer is still supported through the 227i patch. The server browser is really well done.\n+The game gets better and better as it goes, which is saying something with such a breathtaking intro.\n+Movement is fluid and easy and the games unique dodging ability is helpful and adds another layer of depth.\n+The game is challenging without ever feeling unfair or atificial. Enemies aren't bullet sponges on the hardest difficulty. (Note: The 227i patch offers a few more harder difficulties harder than the default games hardest. These difficulties have a big problem of bullet sponging enemy types. The original games hardest (Very Hard) does not.)\n+Return to Napali is decent\n\n[b]The Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal[/b]:\n+-The level design may be the games biggest strength, but sometimes with so many levers being pulled I'm not always entirely sure how I even progressed in the first place. You will get stuck sometimes in these large environments, but honestly it's not so much of a big deal for it to really be an issue.\n\n[b]The Bad[/b]:\n-N/A (Note: This isn't even my favourite game ever and yet it's still the only game I have no cons for)\n\n[b]The Horrible[/b]:\n--N/A\n\nSound: 10/10\nGraphics: 10/10\nGameplay: 10/10\nContent/Replayability: 10/10\nOverall: 10/10\n\nAwards:\nRunner-Up Game of the Year - 1998\nBest FPS of All Time\nBest Soundtrack of All Time\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nThis game is what every shooter should aspire to be.

It is also a genuine visual and aural feast, and a game that presents level and specific sort of challenge that simply isn't seen anymore.\n\nAs is fitting for game's adventurous feel, its levels tend to be huge and exploration-heavy, and often require reading of various clues and careful scrutiny of one's environment in order to proceed. They are always expertly crafted and pleasing to the eye, be they ancient temples and moody ruins with their exquisite architecture, dark spaceship interiors or, especially, Na Pali's unforgettable outdoor locales. Many of Unreal's environments look genuinely beautiful to this day, which is no small feat.\n\nAnother expertly crafted element is the soundtrack, which simply cannot be praised enough. Whether the tracks are subtle and evocative, perfectly fitting for game's slower and exploratory sections, or fast and pumping ones that enhance many of game's intense gunfights, they are always excellent and memorable.\n\nNow, game's gunfight are perhaps its most unusual part, one that will make it or break it for most players. Unreal opted for something quite different from the norm: while it has its share of simpler enemies that are focused on simply attacking the player while moving in his general direction (say, some of Na Pali's native fauna), major part of the game is exact opposite from mowing thru hordes of uninteligent meat. Unreal's most dangerous enemies are sparsely placed through its spacious maps, they are agile, hard hitting, constantly in motion and surprisingly intelligent (they will dodge your projectiles, run to cover, fake death etc). Surviving your encounters with these bastards requires fast reflexes, awareness of your immediate surroundings and understanding the nuances of game's varied and creative (and highly satisfying, if one allows it to be) weapon arsenal.\n\nThis is a must play, and for a particular kind of player that can fully appreciate it, Unreal remains truly one of a kind game: one that was unique back in the day, and one that is even more special today.", "timestamp_created": 1452610201, "timestamp_updated": 1452610924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 72, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.824914", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20396289": {"recommendationid": "20396289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150183370", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 6587, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450138508}, "language": "english", "review": "Including the facts of variable fast paced gunplay (imho - the best of ever made), smart and agile enemies, atmospheric music, peculiar leveldesign and survey/text based narration Unreal can definitely be named the best single player FPS.\nIt's satisfactive to play especialy now, when annoying cutscenes, plot based companions and character progression bullschit are often prior to gameplay which is left dull and boring.\nPS - Don't forget to emulate glide or instal oldureal patch to see all beauty, this game is supposed to have on corresponding hardware.", "timestamp_created": 1452258736, "timestamp_updated": 1488453148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20388571": {"recommendationid": "20388571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045524630", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1051, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512414796}, "language": "english", "review": "Hell yeah I recommend it", "timestamp_created": 1452221203, "timestamp_updated": 1452221203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20242959": {"recommendationid": "20242959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255378939", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 6481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451796653}, "language": "polish", "review": "Gra wszechczas\u00f3w.

I rememer playing the original Unreal not too long after it came out and loved it, but was at that middle school age when finishing games wasn't always my top priority, especially with a game like Unreal where most of the jazz was about the multiplayer experience. Deathmatched with my friends into the wee hours of the night back then. But man, what an absolutely amazing single player experience. Just a few pros to name off the top of my head:\n\n- Music is perfect for the setting, really adds to the ambiance.\n- Story is engaging and delievered in a very unique style.\n- Graphics acually hold up really well.\n- Really solid AI, especially for a game made in '98\n- Fairly challenging, even on lower difficulties. Prepare to use your brain every now and then for puzzles.\n- And most importantly just a flat out good old shooter. The gameplay and guns are just plain fun.\n\nI highly recommend grabbing Oldunreal's 227 patch before diving into this. It really modernizes the game in a few different ways and makes for a really awesome original Unreal experience. Really glad I picked this up during the Steam sale and finally finished the single player campaign.

You play the game as Prisoner 849, who was on a transport ship going to a Moon base prison. However something happens and you awaken with the ship crash landed on a mysterious planet. You blast your way through the game with a whole range of different creative weapons, whilst exploring the planet and trying to figure out what happened to the transport ship by reading varies journals, as well as figuring out a way off the planet. \n\nFor its time the graphics were unreal, with amazing looking environments, lighting and textures, which are more well detailed, especially up close. The levels vary from large open fields with a few houses or caves to explore to smaller areas such as a spaceship or a temple. Each area looks unique and it\u2019s easy to distinguish one area from another. The weapons are fun and unique to use such as the bio rifle which shoots green toxic globs and the flak cannon which shoots out shrapnel, which can ricochet off any surface. The enemies vary from slow moving aliens which fire rocket launchers, to fast moving enemies which shoot projectiles at you, almost every enemy in the game shoots a projectile, only a few will use hit scan weapons. The enemy AI is extremely good and are very challenging. You will find yourself dodging left to right to avoid enemy projectiles whilst shooting them down, which can get very intense. From beginning to end this game is a wild ride and is worth a playthrough.\n\nThe expansion Return to Na Pali is good but doesn\u2019t live up to the main game. You get a few new weapons, which whilst fun to use aren\u2019t that interesting and some new enemies. The story is told a lot more straight forward, through cut scenes and audio blogs from prisoner 849 if you play as a female. The levels for the most part well designed however the level layout makes no sense, in one level you\u2019re in a base which is located in the middle of a cliff and the next level you\u2019re in the mountains.

Buying and playing it again is like coming back to an old friend.\nIt's hard to tell if I should recommend it to players now (Or at the very least, to people not in my age range). It's certainly worth buying on Steam just to have it available if you're looking for a walk along nostalgia lane.\n\nFrankly, it's still a functional game and I'm enjoying coming back to it with two extra decades of general gaming experience. I'm not cheating so much and allowing myself to explore, rather than noclipping through all the doors like I did as a child. I'm reading every translator popup I can find, something I didn't do before. I also never played the expansion. \nWith all of that combined, it's like coming back to a new game in some way.\n\nFor 10$, it's basically the price of a bargain bin game in a retail store.

But first let me tell you that I must've spent MONTHS on this beauty of a game simply because of the amazing atmosphere of EVERY SINGLE LEVEL it has, and its all SP. Most of this game may be its SP, (Single Player) BUT I swear its very fun. Why? Well, let me say that this was one of my early childhood games. It was the second game I ever played, under Quake 2. I believe it was the game I played the most when I was that young. If not this one, then it was Jazz Jackrabbit. (HUGE congrats to those who know what it is, its so obscure these days) Oh, yeah, I REALLY hope Steam brings Jazz Jackrabbit (...2...) here, because I really miss it. The only way to get it is on Amazon. :( Anyway, I'm getting off-topic here, I went all the way to like the 4th-5th level, I mostly knew the second and third levels out of all of them, though, because they were the ones I replayed the most when I had no idea what I was doing as a very little boy. I loved the music on the third one, which, let me say. THIS GAME HAS THE MOST AMAZING MUSIC EVER. Just play through every single level, and tell me it doesn't. Oh, yeah, right, speaking of levels, this game hasn't got much of a story whatsoever, but most are lengthy and there's a TON of levels, enough to keep you busy for a whole month. Trust me. The MP's the practically the same as Tournament, sure, Tournament featured a whole new bunch of things that could be considered balancing to some but I still prefer Gold for even MP purposes. Gameplay's thrilling. I can't say much else, lol, I think that getting the game on a sale is definitely worth it for every FPS lover. I also encourage anybody who enjoys video games, music and ambience to play this, because all three things are top-notch in this game.

Certainly it's not the gameplay. As a classic FPS it can be excused for being mechanically little more than a long string of bullets being introduced to faces, with the bosses being able to take more bullets to the face than most. Admittedly that's a bit of an undersell, since compared to things like the Dark Forces Saga the enemies are pretty varied in their attack forms. But even then only the Skaarj (quick-moving backflip enthusiasts) and Mercenaries (with their shields) have much in the way of techniques that warrant a change in strategy beyond \"pull out a bigger gun.\"\n\nBut for some reason that's apparently the appeal of classic FPSes, sprinting at high speeds while commiting genocide. In which case that's kind of hard to fault. But it's not my preference, so why my love for this game?\n\nThe answer would have to be \"atmosphere.\" Like with Morrowind and Metroid Prime, I'm a sucker for games with a strong sense of place and meaning. Unreal has a sort of psuedo-fantastical feel to it that, along with its minimalist storytelling, gives the game a somewhat mythic feel that's hard not to love. And while the particulars of the layout tend to be fairly nonsensical and \"gamey,\" Unreal's level design is based largely around huge locales that let you explore the ins and outs of them in a way that gives a very tangible sense of scale.\n\nIt's not perfect, and in many ways has not really aged well, but whatever mechanical failures Unreal has is eclipsed by the wonderful weight of its atmosphere. It's still second to Metroid Prime in my not entirely humble opinion, but if it was visually brought up to speed and given the gameplay quality of, say, Half-Life... that'd be hard to top.", "timestamp_created": 1424677263, "timestamp_updated": 1424677263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14592780": {"recommendationid": "14592780", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974374095", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511207182}, "language": "english", "review": "EDIT: wrote this review because today is my 10 year anniversary on Steam and I was feeling nostalgic.  And also because my graphics card has been dead since October and I haven't replaced it and I'm suffering \"gaming-withdrawal\".\n\n\n\nI was 17 in '98. After a decade of console playing, upon graduating high school, that summer I decided to celebrate by building my own computer. Unreal was the first FPS I ever played, on my first homemade computer.\n\nFunny: after my Windows '98 was up and running, I went to my local CompUSA to buy \"Doom\", since that's all I'd ever heard anyone talking about. It wasn't in stock, and the guy behind the counter said, \"Yo, have you heard of Unreal?\" And the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nI was blown away. Sets were colorful, AI was challenging (oh SNAP i just shot him that \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 faked his death!), music was atmospheric, weapons were fun, SP campaign was LONG.  Every time I killed a Skaarj I triumphantly screamed \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 YOU, B\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 and emptied my clip into his carcass just to make sure he wasn't faking me out.  I played that game STRAIGHT for like eight months. Easily 300+ hours. Many times in the middle of the night with earphones blasting and my eyes popping out of my head like a cartoon: WTF IS THAT \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 HOLY \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 ITS COMING RIGHT FOR ME OH YOU WANT SOME TOO???????

A game that I am sure of many people will remember for it's amazing graphics at the time. Even now in 2015 as I am writing this review, I can still say that Unreal is a great looking game with an amazing plot.\n\nUnreal is a fast paced 1st person shooter with a huge campaign, as well as the possibility to fight in deathmatches, capture the flag and many more gamemodes with bots. The levels in this game can be quite difficult to navigate trough and have many secrets to be revealed, but are all extremely well made. There is a large variety of weapons that you'll aquire troughout the game as well as a large variety of enemies that you'll encounter in Unreal's large amount of levels, giving you the possibility to shoot your way out in every way imaginable.\n\nA thing I should also mention is the difficulty of this game. There are 4 different difficulty settings in this game, easy being the easiest setting and 'unreal' being the hardest. What they did is actually improve the enemies' AI, increase their damage and decrease the amount of ammo, health and upgrades you will find troughout the levels. This is something you'll rarely encounter in nowadays' games where they will just increase the damage you'll take and decrease the damage you deal. Unreal has a great way of spicing up things by making it more difficult in different ways.\n\nLike any other game, it needs music. The music in this game is not just some lousy drums and some silly beeps here and there. No no, there's a lot more to it than just that in Unreal. Each and every track is extremely well made and adds a lot more to just a simple level where you pass a cave or tunnel. As soon as you'll enter a spaceship for example, you'll notice the music will change to a more electronic style which fits really well with the level.\n\nAll in all, Unreal is a great fast paced futuristic shooter with a nice variety of weapons, great enemy A.I. and an amazing storyline that I could reccomend to anyone that doesn't care about graphics, but about gameplay instead.", "timestamp_created": 1421365277, "timestamp_updated": 1430585288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605598", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13992443": {"recommendationid": "13992443", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058635054", "num_games_owned": 1389, "num_reviews": 132, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421308709}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the greatest games of all time and still fun all these years later.

I found the environment and atmosphere of this game to be breath taking and indulging. The music only add to the vast and vibrant levels by making it feel like there was a form of suspense or seriousness or maybe just that relaxing music to make you feel like you do not have to worry about much right now on this alien planet. Also, I must mention the AI and enemy design. Not only did this game have insanely intelligent AI, the overall character of the opponent shined differently for each of them. I would say that I played the game completely on Unreal difficulty but still to be that intelligent in the game at all is awesome. They have strafing manuevers, dodging, approaches based on your weapon(yes they will try to charge you if you have an Automag out rather than charge you with a Flakk Cannon out), they can feign death, and even go get help if they feel they might lose the fight. Then, the story. I did not find the story the most compelling but definitely something different and likeable and of course the main protagonist is silent but that just means he is much harder to judge while he remains mostly neutral anyway.

This is one of those games that you NEED to experience before you kick the bucket as it's pretty much the pinnacle of FPS before the massive decline.\n\nThe story is pretty simple, you're an inmate who's prisoner transport ship crash landed on an alien planet and you'll need to explore lengthy, non-linear levels to progress, you can learn some of the games interesting lore by reading messages left on the dead bodies of humans, reading diaries and scripture on walls, similar to that in Metroid Prime where you learn all the lore from scanning objects and alien text on walls.\n\nThe graphics are incredible, especially being that it was originally released in 98', which was one of the best years for gaming in my opinion. The sound is superb, the weapons sound deadly and powerful. The atmosphere is relentlessly amazing through-out largely thanks to the sound effects, music, scenery, amazing lighting effects and all round amazingly designed levels which see you exploring large layouts, filled with many paths and many hidden secrets while fighting bad-ass enemies that fake their death, dodge your attacks and have different behavioural attributes.\n\nThe weapons in Unreal are varied and each behaves in a very unique way, my personal favourite being the Flak Cannon which sends shards of flak at your opponents, shredding them to pieces and has an alternate fire of a grenade that explodes on impact. \n\nI honestly envy you if you haven't played this yet, I'd kill to be able to see everything in this game for the first time again, it's an experience made by true masters who took so many obscure factors into consideration that its scary, this is one solid shooter you don't want to miss out on.", "timestamp_created": 1420221624, "timestamp_updated": 1420243290, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750057", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13685255": {"recommendationid": "13685255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170632585", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419805799}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Oyun, Unreal Tournament'in atalar\u0131ndan.

The story does its job well, and the atmosphere is superb.\n\nMy few complaints would be that some of the mechanisms for opening doors can be arbitrary and confusing at times, as are the few points where you have to kill a certain amount of enemies to progress.\n\nOverall, you won't be disappointed with this game.", "timestamp_created": 1419843865, "timestamp_updated": 1419843865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549030", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13646127": {"recommendationid": "13646127", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972577069", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507171645}, "language": "english", "review": "Unreal.

However, you play it again, since the universe is really addicting. \u2018\u2019Unreal\u2019\u2019 has a nice plot, marvelous soundtrack, huge amount of different weapons, large levels, lots of creatures and incredible for its time game engine (the strongest rival of \u2018quake engine\u2019), which demonstrates its possibilities by showing the large opened areas, detailed water, reflections, shadows and colored lights. Yes, this game is old, it was released in the 1998th year, so I doubt that kids will appreciate at its true value. But if you\u2019re an old school gamer, then you should definitely try this game out, particularly if you have played Unreal Tournament and wish to kick some NPCs\u2019 ass with \u2018shock rifle\u2019 and \u2018flak cannon\u2019.\nNotice: if you decided to play this game, I would recommend you to download high-quality texture pack, Direct3D 9/10, patch 227i and ENB to make the game look better.

There are several different types of aliens to shoot from shark-like creatures to huge titan beasts, there are also upto 13 different types of weapon with alt fire modes. As you progress through the game, you find new weapons and power-ups which can be useful, there are also ammo, armor and health packs which you have to use wisely to conserve resources. When you first buy the game, make sure you adjust the settings to your preferances and optimize the game to run best on your device, I recommend changing the graphical/audio settings, character models, controlls and interface settings before you start playing. There is also multiplayer and bot matches, which host about 20 additional maps, you can set up a match with your friends or if you don't want the fuss just start a bot match and practice, get a hang of the maps and weapons to learn while you progress.", "timestamp_created": 1409525147, "timestamp_updated": 1409525147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441176", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11911826": {"recommendationid": "11911826", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970815801", "num_games_owned": 919, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1409345409}, "language": "german", "review": "[u]Unreal[/u] - Man bekommt heut zu tage zwar grafischen Augen- \nkrebs beim zocken, aber trotz allem hat das Spiel nach all den \nJahren keineswegs an Spielspa\u00df, seiner grandiosen Atmosph\u00e4re \nund dem ziemlich kultigem Retro-Gameplay verlohren !\n\nKlare [u]Kauf-Empfehlung[/u] f\u00fcr jeden Old School-Shooter Fan :)\n\n[b]9 / 10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1409338193, "timestamp_updated": 1409338193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504682", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11903832": {"recommendationid": "11903832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078954500", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495913411}, "language": "english", "review": "the best first person shooter ever!", "timestamp_created": 1409279889, "timestamp_updated": 1409279889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11713303": {"recommendationid": "11713303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125866930", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1410588381}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0430\u043a \u0432\u044b \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435: \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u044b \u043d\u0430 \"\u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435\" \u0448\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044b \u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430?

Without it, countless games are nonexistant.\nWhen this game came out back in '98 I was floored by the scenery.  Escape from the crashed ship and take a minute to look around the world, take in the rich pallet of colors and textures that add so much to the game.  Listen to the score, it's right up there with something by John Williams or Jesper Kyd.  A few years ago they released an Unreal collection that included a cd of the game score, which gets regular play when I'm driving.  I've spent many hours on this alien planet.  It has lots of replay value because of its four difficulty levels.  They don't just make the enemies stronger and your weapons weaker; they make the enemies SMARTER, stronger, and faster, and there's more of them.  There is not much story to the game.  You are a prisoner on the worst prison ship in the galaxy, you have no name, only a number, and the ship crashes on an alien planet.  Your goal is to survive and escape.  No dialog, no cut-scenes, the tutorial is in the manual and if you don't like the default controls you action map them.  Multiplayer is the godfather of Unreal Tournament and its sequels.  This one only has DM, player vs player with or without bots, or player vs bots.  And these bots can get just as brutal as the enemies in single player.\nThe game has few negative qualities to it.  If you look at it from today's perspective the polygons that make up the world and its inhabitants are obvious and they have no textures when you get up close.  According to an interview with developers, time and budget constraints prevented them from putting better textures on objects when you got up close.  What they did get right is the blood and gore aspect.  Shooting an enemy in the head can result in the head flying off and bouncing around while the body tries to stop the bleeding from the neck.  Explosives can render whole bodies (alive or dead) into bloody chunks that get launched across the room.  Try doing that in Battlefield or Mass Effect.\nBottom line: This game has stood the test of time.  It put time in the camel clutch and made time humble.

However; What makes it special is that it was released on its own source, engine, and everything else. It is freely changable with how you play it; Game-speed (overall except of the music), the way you see your weapons (Right, left, center, hidden), and with the custom hud.\n\n  The game is ambientic. You feel like you are going forward the way you ticked those maps off without any kinds of annoying loading screens. And it feels good when you finish the game. Very dramatic.\n\n  Genres: Action FPS + Puzzles. If you are the lazy thinkers of this generation please do not waste your money on this lovely game. All the time it requires thinking and knowing were are you going, were have you been, etc. You do not dumbly shoot the aliens. Never.\n\n  Since the game is old and never gets updated now it contains glitches. If the button is not working, or the door is not opening feel free to use a console. Gladly they do not ruin the game. (Multiplayer is not dead)\n---\n  Weapons.....are unreal. Dispersion Pistol is the cutest~ Automag is for scouts. Stringer is for semi-minigunners. ASMD Shock Rifle is for semi-snipers. Eightball is NOT for rocketjumpers. Flak Cannon will work for anyone...for the shotgunners I would say. Razorjack....love this thing (But not anyone will), GES Biorifle is for spammers! Rifle...for tryhard snipers. Minigun for minigunners...and Dispersion Pistol for kawaii people. :3\n\n  Items....are adorable (Some of them) Invisibility is useful but helpless when you attack someone with it. Flashlights are quick. Flares are useful at dark levels. Nali Seeds....good for people who like to eat healthy stuff~ Everything else you will find out yourself.\n---\n\n\nAnd overall...what can I even say now. Title sais it all!\n\n72/10 Would play forever more, with a lovely Dispersion Pistol and a Razorjack~\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1402980075, "timestamp_updated": 1402980075, "voted_up": true,

Just Unreal released in 1998. Return to Na Pali is one of the biggest craps I've ever played. Unreal (1998) is really well-made game in classic FPS style. Gameplay is addictive, weapons are diversified and every player will be satisfied. There's also some nice maps but in fact I can find few levels (Chizra - The Water God Temple, Bluff Eversmoking...) which I really hate. Unfortunately, I saw some AI bugs but it's some kind of Unreal's appeal. I confess I was not interested in the storyline (I know just the overall meaning) so I won't tell you anything about it. Last levels are really great for me - short, \"quick\" and good. ;) I played it on 'unreal' difficulty level (the hardest) and I finished the game in more or less 20 hours (I have started it twice).\nI have to say something about Return to Na Pali... It is really bad. I thought it will be as good as Quake's mission packs...but no. Levels are boring. I was waiting for the ending during the whole time. I met AI bugs in every level. What about new (3) weapons? Hm... I was using just two of them Combat Assault Rifle (yeah, it is one of my favorite) and Grenade Launcher which I don't like. The third - Rocket Launcher is just weak and useless.\nI finished this erm... mission pack in 8 hours. And if you really want to try it I will just tell you that I prefer to abacinate myself rather than play this again.\nUnreal Gold is worth buying.

on va voir ce que ca donne\" sans me renseigner ou quoi que ce soit.\nHe bien il se trouve que c'est tout simplement le meilleur FPS auquel j'ai pu jouer dans ma vie et je n'en reviens pas.\n\nGraphisme completement dingue (m\u00eame sans mods !) alors que le jeu a 16 ans (sorti en 1998) et fonctionnant du tonnerre en tr\u00e8s haute resolution sur n'importe quel pc (m\u00eame sans carte graphique !) grace \u00e0 son moteur visionnaire qui repoussait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque les limites du possible, bande son totalement geniale, IA surpassant de tr\u00e8s loin tout ce qu'on peut voir actuellement dans nos jeux, univers original et immersif, ambiance totalement g\u00e9niale, bonne dur\u00e9e de vie, bonne difficult\u00e9, exellente jouabilit\u00e9, exellent arsenal, aventure inoubliable, level design tr\u00e8s recherch\u00e9 tr\u00e8s ouvert et tr\u00e8s vari\u00e9, bref, je m'arette l\u00e0 la liste d'\u00e9loge pourait continuer encore tr\u00e8s longtemps.\n\nJe n'arrive pas a croire que ce jeu soit sorti quasiment en m\u00eame temps que Half Life (consid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 sa sortie comme une claque graphique et une exp\u00e9rience hors du commun) alors que Unreal le surpasse sur bien des points, surtout techniquement de tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s loin.\nJeu qui sombre tr\u00e8s tristement dans l'oubli \u00e0 cause du d\u00e9clin de sa license, c'est pourtant un veritable bijou du FPS que nous avons la, vu sa qualit\u00e9 incroyable et son exp\u00e9rience de jeu unique et inoubliable, j'ai du mal a comprendre comment Unreal n'est pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 aujourd'hui comme le ma\u00eetre \u00e9talon du FPS devant doom, ou quake, ou half life, qui poss\u00e8dent pourtant moins de qualit\u00e9s.\nJeu au concept et au design tr\u00e8s novateur dans le domaine du FPS \u00e0 son \u00e9poque, ayant \u00e9norm\u00e9ment influenc\u00e9 l'industrie du jeu vid\u00e9o en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, il fut incompris \u00e0 sa sortie et peut \u00eatre un peu trop en avance sur son temps...\n\nAllez, puisqu'aucun jeu n'est parfait, on pourrait reprocher \u00e0 Unreal de manquer de consistence dans son histoire, sa difficult\u00e9 un peu en dents de scie, ses hitbox parfois un peu foireuses, sa qualit\u00e9 de niveaux un tout petit peu in\u00e9gale, sa fin un peu bacl\u00e9e, ou encore son boss final un peu facile, mais c'est vraiment chipoter.",

It blew everyone's mind at the time with how visually impressive it was, featuring some of the most immersive environments ever created. Of course, Halflife came out later the same year and diverted everyone's attention somewhat, but the the original Unreal remains a must play classic. Set in a futuristic techno-gothic universe with a Mayan touch, Unreal is a fairly long game (unlike many of today's) that should provide a satisfying experience in one of the most unforgettable worlds to be created. I hadn't played this in many (about 10) years, and the nostalgia overload as the second map began (stepping out of the prison ship onto the alien world, and THAT music starts) was well worth the reduced price of \u00a32.99 I can tell you! Not all of the level design is as innovative as the outside parts, there are some Doom style dark futuristic corridoor moments to add variety, and the medieval looking parts are vaguely remeniscent of Heretic. There are some instantly memorable level designs here, and a soundtrack that in places is just unforgettable. The enemy AI was very intelligent for its time, the Skaarj and their dodging in particular will cause you to waste plenty of ammo if you don't aim well. Being that this is Unreal Gold, it includes the Return to Na Pali expansion which despite apparently not being as good, is a good addition for extra gameplay.

But most importantly the deadly ferocious Skaarge: a capital alien race seeking complete control over Napali's resources and claiming it for their own ideal purpose as their planet with its innocent 4-armed inhabitants called the Nali, using them as slaves for their corrupted tasks. The Nali fear the skaarge and the terrors of Napali but they seek and pray for their savior where ever they may be to save them from their control from the skaarge and the threats of Napali to bring them hope and haven to their race, who is you (duh). As an ally to the Nali people they'll aid you in any way possible providing ammo, items, secret routes, and sanity from whatever that was left that they had in their home planet that is now the Hell's Sanctuary. Progressing through the vast beautiful world of Napali you'll encounter many fascinating yet horrific locations such as ancient sky temples, abandoned vandalized villages, other crashed humanoid piloted ships, and finally finding the Skaarge Mothership in order to find and destroy the \"Source\" and ending the Skaarge race once and for all making your escape from Napali with a low fueled but reliable escape pod and float seemingly in space hoping for someone to rescue you to safety..\n\n[Return to Napali] (Expansion Pack)\nOnly realizing that your vision of \"safety\" turns into a return to hell when you're captured from another different human incorporated ship (The UMS Bodega Bay aka Unified Military Service) and be forced to be sent back into the hellish world that you survived again to locate the \"Prometheus\", a ship filled with rich and viable weapons information in which the captain of the Bodega desires for greatly and chose you as their scout due to your cunning experience and survival that you had already on the planet. Once fighting your old pals once again, you locate the ship and find the weapons information in which the Bodega demanded, only realizing after listening to a past recording of another UMS ship that provided a brief description about the Bodega's dark background of its greed and misfortune. You are later attacked by the Bodega's soldiers as they were planning to get rid of you once your mission was complete in order to let no one know about their schemes. After wiping out their attack squads you continue on your own path once again to find an escape out of Napali and getting your revenge to the Bodega. After finally locating your (more improved) mini space shuttle you then escape Napali for good and encounter the \"UMS Bodega Bay\" tricking their attack upon your ship you manage to take down their ship and thus escape with victory and hope that you'll finally find your safe \"Haven\"...\n\n--My Opinions--\n\nAs a childhood classic of mine, I strongly recommend this game for those who love both FPS and are adventurous and love suspense, mystery, and survival in a game. As I already briefly explained the plots to both the game and its expansion pack (or DLC), I can't give it any more other reason to why this old but still decent work of spanktacular beauty, excitement, and challenge is not worth the buy. Already with its amazing architecture, creatures, and story, it is filled with such well composed music that truly brings you with the feeling of sparking your imagination for exploration, survival, and adventure. Despite its exciting intense gameplay, it does have some tedious puzzles that may take some time and thinking to pass but they aren't that bad. Lastly, it also comes with a game editor which captures the essence of its infinitive sense of creativity and exploration of a never ending journey. From designing your own world built by your imagination for the whole world or just your friends to endure your own world in the Unreal universe.\n\n9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1388461692, "timestamp_updated": 1388462378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679785", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8444915": {"recommendationid": "8444915", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036988148", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510440068}, "language": "english", "review": "Unreal is very old, and graphically it shows (Turok N64 feel) (high resolution mods more than make up for this) but the game feels so open world and explorable that it's well worth anybodys time. The maps are huge, with many \"secret\" areas to uncover, and lands to explore, and maybe even encounter a friendly alien just waiting to open a secret to only whom is aware of to unleash some wicked weaponry to use against your foes. The game has stellar ambience with it's soundtrack and design, and can be quite freaky, if not terrifying at times. This game is very twisted in design, unfortunately this sometimes goes a little out of hand, as it can become quite confusing. Regardless of the small flaws, Unreal was still worth my purchase of a retail copy. While quite different from the sequel everyone hated but I enjoyed fairly enough, this game takes you back to the past of exploration in first person shooters while still being quite linear to an acceptable degree. While playing this game, I feel appropriately immersed by it's uncomparable \"Sci-Fi Star Trek\" feel. \n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1388455431, "timestamp_updated": 1391637697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500594", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8432055": {"recommendationid": "8432055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035868451", "num_games_owned": 1010, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417549354}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is called Unreal Gold because it's the last Golden game in the Unreal series.", "timestamp_created": 1388423641, "timestamp_updated": 1388423641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461134", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8421231": {"recommendationid": "8421231", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981578067", "num_games_owned": 383, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1388816948}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply.

a single player game than UNREAL!\nI know it may sound corny, but consider that the game has come out in 1998, and the graphics still look good!\nA 'proper' atmosphere, where players with an actual imagination can try out different ways of tackling any baddies, or different ways of reaching 'secret' places.\nProbably the most enjoyable aspect of this game would have to be the 'physics' with respect of the character you control to its environment:\nthe extremely unique double sideways jump, which made the 'space' jump all but absolete, allows you to reach areas with slanted faces in almost a single movement, thus outmaneouvering opponents, especially in multiplayer LAN games, giving freedom of movement a whole new meaning.\nThe only other game that in my opinion would come close to this kind of control today would have to be: elder scrolls oblivion, another great game, where character control is second to none, especially the jumping ability, something that was unfortunately removed in skyrim.\nHowever, Unreal's real strength (padon the pun, lol) lies with the adventuring and exploration of every nook and crany to find useful items on your journey to escape the planet of the Nali. \nCome-on guys, that's a page turner right there, lol.\nYou're on your own, just crash landed on this UNREAL planet in your prison ship as the only survivor, making your way out of the ship and stepping into a completely alien world of both mysterious wonder and great danger ... now go play the game!\n\nI don't actually play the STEAM version of this game, as I have a fully customized version of it thanks to the support of a still very large UNREAL community, like oldunreal.com, where people still release amazing new player maps, single or multi player ones.\nI only bought this game to let the developers know that there are still seriously UNREAL fans out there, and I sincerely wish they would remake the single player game of it again using todays graphics tools and hardware available.\n... imagine the eye-candy when playing Nali Castle, Spire or Bluff Eversmoke maps ...\nAnyway, before I get too carried away: it's a damn great game, ESPECIALLY if you've never played it!\nGet it, then get yourself the high-resolution texture packs, and for heaven's sake, lose yourself in the atmosphere ...\njust for the record, I still play this game several times a year for several weeks at a time EVERY YEAR since its release, that's how damn good UNREAL really is!", "timestamp_created": 1385722674, "timestamp_updated": 1385722674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8,

The original Unreal is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Lots of awesome original weapons, all with alternate fires, all super fun, and with such meaty sound design. And you gotta love those super deep-voiced grunts when you jump. Lots of fascinating enemies and NPC interactions. Really great lore and worldbuilding from the text logs you can observe, and a real sense of scale and gravitas with the story despite the complete lack of dialogue. No cutscenes, all real-time and ambient, but with sick-ass music. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant map design, with breathtakingly expansive levels to explore. \n\nAesthetically, everything in the game is just beautiful, even today. Such colorful and lush sci fi landscapes and architecture, and not just the usual everything-is-metal-and-high-tech stuff you often think of when thinking of sci fi settings. It's truly an alien world... And the enemy AI is actually challenging and crazy smart, which is just astounding considering this is a game from 1998 and how lame AI often still is today. The game is really challenging in general, and it is very long.\n\nWhen I think of a true JOURNEY of a game, I think of this very Unreal right here. No fucking Tournament, just plain-ass original Unreal 1 right the fuck here. It is positively... UNREAL, the places you'll go in this game. The very definition of an adventure. People always going on about how great Half-life is, but I honestly feel this game might be a notch or two more amazing than Half-life, for the same sorts of reasons Half-life 1 was/is awesome. And I do fucking LOVE Half-life. This game... This game gave me feelings, guys. Real fucking feelings. I was truly in awe. This game should be recognized more, and it has my 100% recommendation, especially considering the price.\n\n\nThe expansion, Return to Na Pali gives a bunch more levels for even more Unreal goodness and continues the story directly where Unreal 1 left off, but the player character is suddenly given a voice, and I think that goes against what the original Unreal was about. He'll (you'll) talk in between levels in some dumb kinda unncessary monologue about what just happened and what's going to happen next. So Return to Na Pali is the same fun as Unreal 1, but with some mediocre new narrative style. So even including Return to Na Pali and Unreal 2 (which goes even further into the voiced characters, try-hard hamfisted story bullshit territory, and is really quite a different kind of game altogether), there truly hasn't been another game quite like Unreal since Unreal came out all these years ago, and while the Unreal Tournament games aren't bad, I think it's a damn shame Epic (Mega)Games never made another game as incredible in the way Unreal was. Here's hoping for a really good current-gen remake of some sort; this singleplayer Unreal truly deserves another chance in the spotlight. Or perhaps a whole new Unreal game altogether, if they can nail it like this one did, and take away from the stains of Return to Na Pali and Unreal 2. It is one of the most amazing experiences I've ever played, and I wish more people could understand what I'm talking about by playing the game for themselves. So go do that, reader!

Unreal Gold is an exceptionally well done title, with complex map and world design, encouraging the exploration of levels and scenery. There is a story told within the game - mostly in text logs and level pacing. It's old fashioned and true, requiring not countless hours of cinematics taking up the entire game. \n\nUnreal Gold suffers from one huge flaw, and that is the lack of an FPS cap. For older computers that was not a problem, but for todays more powerful rigs and technology, it is. The game essentially runs without a hitch, but to make it playable you will need to download community patches to address the issue of having unlimited FPS. \n\nUnreal Gold is an excellent title and despite the years gone by it still stands fast in terms of quality and entertainment to be derived from it.

I hated this game as a kid. I couldnt' get used to the movement, the enemy AI and guns at the time. But I recently bought Unreal and Unreal Tournament 99 and 2004 on GOG. So I thought I should do a review that gives the game justice. \n\nUnreal basically is a game where you are a prisoner that crash lands on a planet. Your goal is to get out alive. You go from alien ship to building killing loads of enemies while solving puzzles with fast precise movement and strafing. Not plot heavy, but hey, it's a old school FPS it doesn't need to.\n\nNow that I'm 20, I love this game to death. I play the DRM free version of it actually. The main reason I love this game is because it's old school. I love the old school genre of FPS Games like Serious Sam, Doom, Blood 2, Painkiller, and recently DUSK. \n\nThe movement is so amazing. It feels like you are actually experiencing an earthquake at one point and that is just an achievement in it's own right. The movement is one of the best things about the game. I love it.\n\nThe enemy AI is some of the best I have ever encountered in a video game, they are difficult to kill, but yet they seem fair to the challenge of the entire game. When you kill a boss, it feels like you are strong and have accomplished something.\n\nThe graphics are amazing too (Well, in 1998) As with Half Life's Gold Source Engine, Unreal uses it's Unreal Engine 1, making it revolutionary for the time being. Many other engines followed in the coming years leading to Unreal Tournament 4 (Or UT 2017) which has continued the arena based shooter franchise.\n\nOverall, the game is fantastic is still holds up with the original Unreal Tournament.\n\nBut before I end my review, I want you people to stay away from the Sequel Unreal 2 The Awakening. It ruined any chance of a Unreal 3 due to it's clunky shooting and slow movement controls and bascially having nothing to do with the original Unreal. It was obviously made for consoles as it was released on Xbox. But Unreal Championship was like a launch title and that was better than Unreal 2! \n\nWhatever. I'll just stop my blabbering here.

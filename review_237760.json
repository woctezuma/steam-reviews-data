The Music selection however is not very good in my books. Some licensed music would have been nice but it's very understandable why it's not here. I suggest to anyone playing to turn off the in game music and instead have a playlist of Dubstep artists like Excision, Datsik or Camellia playing in a google chrome tab. The visuals are quite clean and nice however I'd like the cursor color to be just a tad bit more noticeable  because sometimes the color 1 from one right might be color 2 of the next and you could accidentally lose combo because of the slight lack of visual information on what color your cursor is. Also in flood and minefield special rounds I find the screen to be a bit too busy, that is the sole reason why I prefer Reaction and Acceleration more. All the gameplay is quite solid and simple. Powerups work great with the exception of the mushroom, do yourself a favor and use your mg elsewhere. 10.99CAD is also a bit of a steep pricetag for a game like this. around 5 bucks would be a great deal for a package like this. \n\n\nI'd score this a 7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1510909907, "timestamp_updated": 1510909907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36091220": {"recommendationid": "36091220", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967399452", "num_games_owned": 777, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509226217}, "language": "french", "review": "Si vous \u00eates fan de hi-score et de challenges rapides, alors c'est le bon jeu pour vous.

It'll have you on the edge of your seat and being all aggressive with your mouse. The game is [i]well worth the full price[/i] with various modes, great effects, and well placed achievements. If hesitant, keep an eye out for [i]Cipher Prime Studios[/i] bundles.\n\n***\n\n[i]Intake[/i] is a small arcade game with the singular goal of racking up combos by wiping out multicolored pills as they fall from above. The standard mode has you popping pills before they hit your \"shield\"/goal area. Right clicking shifts the color of your \"shield\" area as well as your mouse. Matching the mouse color with the falling pill's color will result in the start of a chained combo. Only combos can increase your score. If a pill touches down and the color matches? Your \"shield\" will take care of it. If it doesn't, you'll lose a life. Fairly simple.\n\nAs simple as the gameplay [i]should[/i] be, standard mode's levels grow progressively faster and more chaotic. \n\nOne of the cool things about [i]Intake[/i] is its system of unlockables. If you're looking for a challenge, beside the standard mode, there are additional game modes that unlock as you play. These include: [i]Acceleration, Flood, Pro, Minefield,[/i] and [i]Reaction.[/i] For example, [i]Acceleration[/i] lobs pills at you with insane speed while [i]Minefield[/i] psyches you out, playing the game's frantic pace against you by making every pill a flashbag which temporarily stuns you visually. There's also powerups, cool effects, additional color pills, and other interesting things to unlock.\n\nYou can compare your scores with friends or against other Intake players around the globe. The game also features achievements and decent looking badges. If you're into badge making, the wallpapers and emotes are nice looking. \n\nSome of the negative reviews claim that the soundtrack lacks diversity. This is only partly true and might only apply to new players. You can [i]unlock songs[/i] from your Drugstore as you gain the in-game currency called [i]mg[/i] (miligrams). While you might be stuck playing the pep rally techno \"Be Aggressive\" for an hour or so, that can be changed by racking up enough mg. It could take a while depending on your skill and time dedicated to the game. In all honestly, I'm not too concerned with the song selection in my arcade games so YMMV.\n\nWhy did I explain the game in so much detail? Because [i]if Intake lacks anything, it would be proper guides and tutorials.[/i] It's all trial and error. [i]Cipher Prime Studios[/i] is known for releasing games which are both artistic and minimalist. Their puzzle/strategy games such as [i]Fractal: Make Blooms Not War[/i], [i]Auditorium,[/i] and [i]Splice[/i] are all \"learn by doing.\" [i]Aesthetics heavy, explanations nill.[/i] Unlike [i]Splice,[/i] the mechanics are not really that difficult to master.\n\n[i]Intake[/i] is for arcade players with quick reflexes. The overall rave/drug scene references might not be for everyone but, if you made it this far in the review, who cares? You're probably fine with it. The game play is solid, the music is catchy, it has excellent visuals, and it's well worth its price in gold-pressed latinum.

It wasn't easy, because each time I decided I won't be playing this game anymore, I started it up for \"the last time\". I did that like 10 or 15 times already.\n\nWhat is Intake?\n\nIt's a game about dubstep drugs. Yup. That's it. Drugs. And Dubstep.\nHow is that a good combo?\nWell, Intake is a very simple in design game. You have to destroy colored pills. There are two colors, but you can only use one at a time. Two button game. Quick and easy. The difficult part begins when game throws hoards of those pills at your face in a split second. Did I mention flashbangs? Oh yeah, Intake has them. Lots of them at times. Hit one and your combo (and screen, and sanity, and flow) are gone. \n[i]Wait, wait... what combo?[/i]\nWell, the more pills you hit without missing, the higher your combo, the higher your combo, the better your score. Combos grant you really weird power-ups as well.\n\n[i]Okay, okay, but is it a good game?[/i]\n\n[b]Yes.

Efectos de sonido y estimulos de recompensa hechos aposta para que te vicies! Cosas a desbloquear, logros, desafios.... Me ha costado unas 9 horas de juego para llegar al nivel 100, y la curva de reflejos y concentraci\u00f3n es muy gratificante. \n\nAunque se hace todo m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil cuando desbloqueas ciertas mejoras, no me parece f\u00e1cil en general, sobre todo a partir del nivel 60, o los desafios. De todas formas, me veo incapaz en esta vida de sacarme todos los logros... es decir: 1000x combo? Completar los 100 niveles sin morir, sin upgrades y sin perder ning\u00fan combo? Are we crazy? Pero vamos, esto es bueno, entre los desafios y completar ciertos logros da para much\u00edsimas horas m\u00e1s. \n\nDe hecho lo veo un buen juego para calentar si vas a tener una partida seria luego a otro juego. Ocupa poco y las partidas no son largas, es un buen arcade para matar ratos cortos, o para tirarte con \u00e9l unas horas.

'Intake' is a fast paced, highly addictive, musically-driven score attack that tests your reflexes as you struggle to save a body from certain death as pills fall from the throat of it's seemingly unhappy owner. I'm not really sure why this person is trying to end their life, perhaps they recently lost their job, or maybe they're going through a nasty divorce, or maybe'Starbucks' was just out of their favorite blend of coffee; nevertheless, it's up to us to save them.\n\nThe gameplay is extremely simple, which goes for most great games of this genre. Snap your mouse back and forth and destroy the falling pills with the coordinating colors before enough fall past you, and you die. The more pills you destroy in a row, the bigger the bonus, and the more rounds you get through, the more intense the gameplay becomes as the game throws combinations of \"attacks\" at you. 'Intake' takes the things that made 'Tetris' memorable and builds upon them, so you know it's good.

Being reasonable at twitch games and tetris etc i thought this would be a walk in the park, I am now looking at some of the achievements wondering if its possible. you simply mouse over the pill to pop it however the pills at first come in 2 colours ( which as you progress you get the choice of different colours and music ) so you pop say a green pill with left mouse and then click right to change colour and pop a red pill doesnt sound to taxing until there are 20 of them dropping quickly towards the bottom of the screen, a few hit home and its game over. There are also pills which you must completerly ignore or they accelerate all other pills to the bottom of the screen.\n\nDuring the main game you get the chance to collect little white pills which are redeemable in the store for perks ( slow down, electric shots etc ) these do help but in now way make you feel powerful you also get a small drop of these pills which you have to shoot to collect at the end of your game via a bonus round. The further you get in the main game the more the pills in your bonus game will be worth - so basically you will have more cash to spend on perks.\n\nHard to describe how totally addictive this game is, when i first played it my coordination was all over the place which made it a stressful ( not in a fun way ) game.

mental reflexes to their limits.

Shoot the right colored pills, keep the combos running to boost your score, and most of all, avoid losing the few lives granted. You can also purchase more music, more powerups, more lives, more colors, and so much more with your... um... \"drug money?\". These will help you accomplish so much more in the game, but they can also be turned off if you don't like the option, or if you really wanted to test yourself.

I grabbed it awhile back before it was on Steam and loved it - how excited was I when a few months later I noticed I could activate it in my library!\n\nIt's a sleeper hit, unknown gem, whatever adjective pair you want to use to describe it is applicable.  It's well polished, addictive, and fast paced - like the best Shmups (might be why I'm so drawn to it).\n\nThe premise is simple: click on pills to make them explode.  Two colors come down at once, right click to swap between colors, build combos, and set high scores.  \n\nIn execution, it gets tricky: the music is blaring, your palms are sweating, and the pills keep coming.  You click and click and click but the waves keep coming down.\n\nIt's intensely fun with superb sound design.  Speaking of which, make sure you have some solid headphones.  You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you had little cheapo earbuds in while you played this.  The best experience is engrossed with your nose an inch from the monitor and the EDM soundtrack and high-quality sound effects bursting your eardrums.\n\nThe visuals are really nice too.  Nothing too complex, a few particle effects and some color shadings but the game pulls it together into a great, color popping aesthetic.  \n\nAs for settings options, for an indie game this guy is packed full of them.  Full featured color-blind modes, \"gartnervision\", which gives background to the landscape mode the game is set in, a full suite of upgrades to unlock and turn on and master, even different game modes and challenges including a \"No Nonsense\" mode which cuts out bonus levels and keeps you in the heat of things longer and at a faster pace.  You can really tell with the available settings, options, and unlocks that the developers really cared about this game and took the time to polish all the edges - even the flavor text for your power ups has funny little quips that fit the theme of the game.\n\nDon't miss this one.  I'd recommend it for just about any gamer with a love for pulse-pounding action, especially if you want something to pick up for short period of time play...if you can put it down.\n\n-Be Aggressive.\n\nP.S. - the quality of the soundtracks in the game is very high - the review video on Steam doesn't do it justice.

CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK !\n\nTo break the monotony every once in a while,, you get a special level with one difficulty setting pushed much higher, like much more pills onscreen (\"flood\" levels), or less pills onscreen with a much faster falling speed.\nThis is 100% skill based and feels like a nice mouse aiming / reaction time skill test.\nI think the game is entirely procedural/randomized. It just gets harder until you eventually lose.\n\nThere are some bonuses here and them (items, unlockable) which you should have all unlocked in a few hours hours. Hopefully they do not distract too much from the gameplay (just like the special levels, they help break the monotony).\n\nAbout the graphics: they do their job. Pretty but the readibility is good, which is absolutely necessary for a fast-paced game like this. There are some nice hommages to arcade some will catch :) With some tweaks to difficulty and items, this would sure make an excellent arcade game. If arcades still existed.

Its a simple mechanic, of two coloured pills each level. You can switch colours between the two and match to maximise score. Although im not a big fan of dubstep, the music is still impressive and well done, I do like the way the colours compliment eachother and the way the levels ramp up makes the game really hard. The powerups are fun and interesting and overall the game is impressive.\n\nA game is nothing without its faults, It has a very strange screen resoulution, screaming that this is a phone game aswell, and personally i think the powerups came in rediculously frequently. I also think the bright colours may or may not hurt peoples eyes.\n\nIn conclusion, if your looking for a game about popping pills, then you probably might need help, but this game is really fun arcade score attack and I'd advise considering this game.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1392163607, "timestamp_updated": 1406887727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9056287": {"recommendationid": "9056287", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963115458", "num_games_owned": 961, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1398193646}, "language": "german", "review": "http://youtu.be/c1E6fVeax0I", "timestamp_created": 1392143897, "timestamp_updated": 1392143897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513811", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8934769": {"recommendationid": "8934769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079232557", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1394116640}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 timekiller. \u0417\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438.", "timestamp_created": 1391263798, "timestamp_updated": 1391263798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8912909": {"recommendationid": "8912909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043883206", "num_games_owned": 332, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507757811}, "language": "czech", "review": "Very good game !", "timestamp_created": 1391108212, "timestamp_updated": 1391108212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8900464": {"recommendationid": "8900464", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972319241", "num_games_owned": 948, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1397225759}, "language": "english", "review": "I wasn't sure about this game, but now I'm absolutely in love.

Likely.\n\nTo be honest, you should get what this game is about just from the video and screenshots. Perhaps, exactly what's going on make sort of confuse you, so I'll elaborate. Intake is an drug/rave/club referencing arcade action title requiring the player to \"stay alive\" by destroying pills that are floating down the screen. At any given time, the pills will be of one or two colors in which will add to your combo if the game screen is in the right color. The default controls are as simple as can be: Mouse to aim, left click to shoot,  right click to swap color (besides mouse aim, you can rebind the keys in the launcher, which may actually improve performance for you for keyboard keys). If you click a pill in the wrong color, it will be destroyed, but any combo you had will be lost. You want to destroy pills before they hit the bottom of the screen. If they reach the bottom and your screen is the wrong color, you will lose a life. The mechanic is reminescent of Ikaruga and eXceed 2nd: Vampire Rex.\n\nWhat makes the game interesting enough to bother playing with, besides it's simple, yet addicting (no pun intended) mechanics is it's art direction. From it's sharp, modern rave club color pallete and interface to its dubstep music and clean, non-intrusive sound profile, Intake leaves you immersed in a exciting experiene.\n\nAs you clear pills, you will meet the goal of completing the level, which turns all pills on the screen into colorless tablets which can be gathered for extra Mg (Milligrams, points basically) as well as enabling an arc of tablets which can be collected for points. After earning enough Mg, next time you loose, you can buy upgrades including more music, more color pallets, invicibility bigger pills and extra lives, which will probably be the most important upgrade. Higher levels get harder as pills fall down faster, more pills spawn and black pills called Flashbangs that will stun you and temporarily blind you to pills. Eventually events occur such as a massive flood of pills or a small comet-like attack of extremely fast moving pills. \n\nIntake is extremely fun and addicting. Unfortunately, the game gets a little too hard for my skill level around the high 20's/early thirties, which is a shame because I really enjoy the game. I can see myself maybe improving a bit, but I'm not quite sure I can reach the skill level needed to go much beyond game leve 31 or so. That said, beyond the fact that I only had one track when I played (I unlocked another, but for some reason I still had the same song) I can recommend this game to basically anybody that is into arcade style games and isn't epileptic. The drug and party theme will put off the conservative and parental types, but it doesn't necessarily romanticise the use of drugs and instead is more of a theme for gameplay, much like Dr. Mario.", "timestamp_created": 1387990692, "timestamp_updated": 1387990692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8272199": {"recommendationid": "8272199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044743269", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425214557}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc804\ud615\uc801\uc778 Easy to Get, Hard to Master.\n\ud558\ub2e4 \ubcf4\uba74 \uc0c9\uc0c1\uacfc \uc774\ud399\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ucde8\ud558\ub2e4 \ubabb\ud574 \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub85c \uc57d\uc744 \ube60\ub294\ub4ef\ud55c \ub290\ub08c\uc744 \ub290\ub084 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1387971024, "timestamp_updated": 1387971024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8267451": {"recommendationid": "8267451", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996677565", "num_games_owned": 598, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469510112}, "language": "english", "review": "\ubcf8\uaca9 \uc57d\ube60.. \uc57d \uae68\ubd80\uc218\ub294 \uac8c\uc784", "timestamp_created": 1387948479, "timestamp_updated": 1387948479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8255166": {"recommendationid": "8255166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023973147", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1388113753}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know why this is fun. \nDoesn't stop me from playing it.

Cipher Prime has always had great music in all their other games (Auditorium, Pulse, and Splice come to mind) but this is, to my knowledge, the first dubstep-centric game which they have done, and the tracks are fantastic. Plus, everyone knows that dubstep is the sound Transformers make when they are making little Transformers.\nSound effects are likewise well done and fit well with the music, so much so that listening to the soundtrack alone feels like something is missing.\nThe gameplay is simplistic and easy to comprehend, yet rewarding. You use your mouse to shoot pills, which fall from the ceiling in two colors. Your spacebar (or second mouse button) switches the color of your laser, and the game records your ongoing combo. \nThere are plenty of unlocks (new tracks and pill color combinations) and powerups to keep the game fresh through multiple playthroughs. \nIncludes both local and global scoreboards, as well as Achievements. One of those achievements is called \u201cDouble Rainbow.\u201d Don\u2019t throw your money at the screen so hard, you might break it. \nHas the classic \u201cWinners Don\u2019t Do Drugs\u201d splash screen which took me back to my days in the arcade playing Street Fighter II.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nIf you\u2019re not a fan of dubstep/techno, you will probably not enjoy this game.\nBeing a throwback to the days of arcade games where the only objective was a higher score, there is little replay value for those who prefer storylines or need some sort of ending. \nThe game can be a little unforgiving at first, with only two or three mistakes resulting in a Game Over.\nCan you play it while the children are awake?:\n\nSure, though it won\u2019t make any sense to them. No real violence to speak of. You may \nwant to keep your child away if they are epileptic, though the game has no specific \nwarning about this.\n\nWhile I\u2019m picking nits\u2026\n\nMake sure you have a good headset or earbuds to play this game with. I found it\nenjoyable both on my Turtle Beach headset and my Beats earbuds. Also, I personally\nthink Cipher Prime is an underrated studio which deserves support so they can continue\nmaking games. They just successfully kickstarted Auditorium Duet, so I am not the only\none who feels this way. Cipher Prime makes fantastic casual indie games and amazing\nmusic. Their games are money well spent no matter which one you buy.\n\nDid I make time to complete it?:\n\nI\u2019m not sure there is any \u201ccompleting it.\u201d Remember, arcade style. I have put a couple\nof hours into it and certainly came away satisfied. Also, the soundtrack made it to my\niPod for working out.\n\nRecommended Purchase Price:\n\n$8.99 (which is the current sale price on Steam through Nov 12,).

There is 2 colors changing each round, and you can unlock a harder difficulty by unlocking 3 colors or more.\n\nThe game is enjoyable, playable and most of all replayable :)! but as i said, the major thing that drags it down is the lack of music :(\n\n8/10!", "timestamp_created": 1384078426, "timestamp_updated": 1385407262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499682", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7614180": {"recommendationid": "7614180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024999020", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512202251}, "language": "english", "review": "For those of you who don't think a time-waster game could possibly take over your life, I dare you to buy Intake.

While playing records you have the option to add effects (more available than on a DJM 1000...if anyone knows what that is), mix with a crossfader, and change individual gains.  You can also change the visual effects of the environment around you while playing.\n\nThe concerts are visually insane.  This contains one of the most stunning uses of VR as an art form that I have experienced so far.  Personally, it has run flawless for me also so I am unsure of the negative reviews from others recently due to issues they are having.  If I can run it on my old PC without issue than it can be assumed the issue lies with them or their system and not with the game itself.\n\nOh did I mention it is free?!?\nI hope more continue to join in the future so that content continues to be updated", "timestamp_created": 1509009640, "timestamp_updated": 1509009640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36006559": {"recommendationid": "36006559", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984041293", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500607332}, "language": "english", "review": "This is fantastic!

Hands down one of the best VR experiences available, free or otherwise. Beautiful, fun, and the live shows are absolutely stunning. \n\n\n________\n\nI'm not one to usually take the time to review games, but TheWaveVR deserves a few moments of my time, just as it does whole heaps of yours. \n\nOn it's own, it's a well accorded and usually decently populated digital space. You have a private area, your Cave, that gives you a dashboard for friend controls and wardrobe, as well as a dance floor and dj booth. While you're not going to find bleeding edge mixing tools, you're given a few dozen tracks of a decent variety and a handful of intuitive sliders and controls. While the experienced DJ might find it elementary, for the average noob it's a blast to mess around with. And once you feel like you want to show off your skills, you can even invite aforementioned friends over for a concert. \n\nThe public digital space is called the Expanse, and is rather expansive. There is a main hub with a selfie stick and accompanying jumbotron, as well as a store for buying a variety of digital toys, BUT DON'T WORRY! This ISN'T some cheap microtransaction ploy!

Stable, smooth, and without any glitches or connection isues. \n\nEven if you're not an EDM fan, this is worth at least wandering around in.

The party poppers are something like a disco ball the flys up using a pre-made animation. The toys are things like bubbles or fire spinners that you mess with. The stuff going on during a show is like the trips. It appears a lot of it uses shaders to get cool effects and can use models or pre-made animations for other effects.\n\nThe game is free to play. Currently there are no micro transactions but there is an in-game currancy that is earned through in-game actions. The currency can be used to by in-game items.

I met many wondeful people in this world. I felt at home, and that is a precious commodity in these times.\n\n  I stumbled across an after hour party hosted by one of the devs, Grimecraft. He was exhausted, as was Adam Arrigo, CEO of The Wave. They had been in VR for countless hours, evangelizing this glorious Alice in Wonderland experience that they and their team had created. We got invited to Grimecraft's personal homespace. His cave. And he DJed the last party of the first day. And it was glorious. And Adam shared his toys with us and I felt a kinship with those in the room. As if I'd taken XTC except I was totally sober. \n\n There was a young guy in the room, 14 or 15, and British, by his accent. He questioned Adam, and exclaimed his wonderment at the experience. And I was uplifted hearing him. For I realized there was hope in the world, for a positive future. His wonderment healed my soul, eased my typical cynicism. And that is priceless. \n\n April 13, 2017. A day I shall always remember. For today the Metaverse was born.

Definitely, an experience \"tripping\" with other people and even getting the chance to speak with some of the developers. Visually, it's face melting and if you are glow stick junky, you're going to feel right at home tracing crazy shapes all over the place like I did. We can't forget the sound... the ambience makes the visuals pop, part carcadian rhythm, part cuckoo juice that turns any sane human into a crazed monkey addicted to drinking battery acid. In other words, it's best described as if the Secret Life of Walter Mitty fell in love with Adventures of Baron Munchausen. I even think that every stage performer/artist could only dream of giving an experience like this to their audience. Kiss those dreams goodbye because, well, it's real now but in a virtual reality kind of way. \n\nI could go on about the visuals and how it's psychedelic, magical, Alice in Wonderland-ish but what really stuck out was the social aspect of the experience. Sharing a \"trip\" had just about everybody going, \"whoa, this is cool\" especially when you had that one thing we bought in the game that just made you feel like you just melted, man, just melted. For someone my age, now 35, I'm transported back to \"high\" school and college during the good ol' transformative years of experimentation and connecting at different wave lengths with people. The presentation and environment is every bit tie dye and whimsey with hearts floating all around you when you make friends with people... Oddly satisfying and sort of erotic, in a cartoony way. In one instance, I got lost in the overworld with someone and we traveled together and met back with the group. It's tough not to get giddy. \n\nAs far as immersion goes, TheWaveVR, just effin' nails it. Think about the Nintendo days when games slowed down and that actually helped you beat a game or when you have to wait in line at a busy club and they let all the girls in but kept all the guys outside because the door guy was being a bucket of cement... It was exactly like that. Everyone was so anxious to get in and spend all their hard earned trippy pills, the only way to protest was to start putting on a lightshow at the door. Even though several of us were a few trippy pills short, there was enough bromance to go around. And then I got in... I started to feel sorry for the bros waiting outside in the cold. I know they would have felt the same for me (I think lol) but I knew they were there for the same reason. Our destinies lied where the DJ booth was shreading the tables so they would understand it wasn't my fault that the computer chose me instead of them. \n\nDespite some of the glitches, I came out utterly surprised about what I really liked about TheWaveVR. You could take a single player game and if it crashes, steam is going to be pouring out of your ears. If you are playing a multiplayer game where it's player(s) vs player(s), you are going to get pissed off that you can't put digital bullets inside somebodies pixel skull or when the loading screen just goes on and on. I know we've all been through these types of scenarios and many times just makes the blood curl. Where TheWaveVR succeeds is how it draws connections between people that are in it and with the dj. So what if you've lost a few brain cells bugging out with some random person you met. Are you honestly going to tell me that the last Wolverine movie you saw was so intellectually stimulating? Probably not. I'll tell you this though, there is social intelligence baked into the concept of this app. From the connecting umbilical chord when people are all drawing, shared tripping experiences, to the dj tonguing our ears with the beats and painting our eyes to the rhythm. I still can't get over not being able to get \"into the club\" (some waited 45 minutes)... and even if someone was anxious, well, we all shared that anxiety... Here man, I got something that might take some of the edge off. \n\nTHINGS I LIKE: \n+ Fast teleport\n+ Trippy visuals\n+ Engaging with people\n+ Glitches and waiting to get into the club\n\nWISHLIST:\n- Having a map, nsew\n- A board with all the performers and when they are scheduled to perform\n- A board with most popular performers\n- make a cocktail out of the trippy pills\n- purchase/free albums for attending event\n- open mic nights. \n- be able to toggle between music and people talking\n- live broadcast for those goobers who don't have vr  (kidding, I still love you even if you are one \"d\" short of 3d)\n\n8 Graphics: plain background, awesome special effects. \n8 Control: teleport, 8, superfast and I yet have to race someone from end to the other, needs hot keys\n9 Comfort: w/ teleport you don't get sick\n10 Sound & Music: drop the base!\n\n\nI love this one.

Imagine being IN one of them.\n\nThe visuals combined with the music are beyond astounding. The trips legitimately made me feel like I'm tripping.\n\nYou get small achievements for exploring and being social.  This game was designed to be social and it's best experienced like that. \n\nYou can get currency to spend on trips, which range from psychedelic visuals to fun little mini games. You can also buy streamers and fire nunchucks and hottubs.\n\nThe population is low. I only found 4 people online when I was on at most,  but everyone is always friendly.  Dancing and tripping with randoms is a lot of fun.\n\nYou have your own cave in which you can create your own music and image.  I've tinkered a bit and it seems like you can really create your own unique aesthetic. \n\nYou can mix and fade and distort the music in different ways and host parties at these locations as well.\n\nI haven't done a live music show but I'm extremely excited.  I want more people to play this.\n\nIf you like electronic music and amazing mind warping visuals, you're at home.", "timestamp_created": 1516931071, "timestamp_updated": 1516931071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}}}

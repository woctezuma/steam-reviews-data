The women in the group are interesting and fun to play. The items and the way leveling works is good. The thing is playing alone is too difficult and the mechanics work against you.\n\nThe color shield mechanic forces everyone to be present and active but could make play one-sided if only one color is left. It's not like you can't hit the enemies, it just won't do any damage. This could lead to situations where one play is really bored. Also in single-player it gets frustrating that you have to switch back and forth between two characters. It's even worse when one of your characters is down. The shield just clutters up the screen with the same color as the character and gets in the way of a fun action game.\n\nSince I only recommend picking this up if you're going to play co-op you should know that the characters do not interact with each other besides resurrections. If you do want to play single player make sure to turn on story mode.

I'm not a huge fan of the level-up system, but it does give you the option of grinding to overcome a particularly hard level.\n\nOne of the best co-op experiences I've had.", "timestamp_created": 1520868370, "timestamp_updated": 1520868370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40763193": {"recommendationid": "40763193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282570727", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2421, "last_played": 1521726381}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u80fd\u591a\u4eba\u4e00\u8d77\u73a9\u66f4\u597d\u3002\uff08\u987a\u4fbf\u6c42\u6ce2\u597d\u53cb\u4e00\u8d77\u73a9\uff09", "timestamp_created": 1520856341, "timestamp_updated": 1520856341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40752602": {"recommendationid": "40752602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081270242", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 3219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 344, "last_played": 1521748111}, "language": "english", "review": "Having played through the game with 2 friends, figuring out all the secrets on our own, then doing NG+ solo, and then moving on to speedrunning this game, I absolutely think that it is a blast. Fans of Castle Crashers will feel right at home here, with similar gameplay, personally I find the gameplay much more rewarding than that of Castle Crashers.\n\nThe game had a bit of a rocky launch with some connection issues, all of which have been fixed now, and the game plays very smoothly both solo and coop, so whether or not you have friends to play with, or someone to sit on the couch and play  with, a mixture of the two, or just want something to do to destress on your own at the end of the day its a great choice. \n\nThis game is difficult, I'm not going to sugar coat it in the slightest, its hard, you will die, and die again, but the action is fast paced and whenever you do die the game throws you right back in really fast, and you lose no character progress when you die, so you will always get stronger no matter what, which allows for even some younger or inexperienced players to have fun and not feel stuck while playing. \n\nMusically this game is very well done, and the character dialogue is very good, and pretty funny, however some people disagree on that point, depends on whether or not you like one-liners really. But if that isn't for you, you can disable all non-essential dialogue (so 99% of dialogue) in the options menu. I highly recommend however, that you do the first playthrough with dialogue on, then future playthroughs it is up to you.\n\nAll in all I thoroughly enjoy this game, and will continue to do so for the forseeable future, so if you are interested pick it up, and give it a shot. \n\nOne more thing, there is currently no lobby system for multiplayer, its all through steam invites right now, however the devs have stated that the next patch, which is coming soon, will remedy this, so if that's a deal breaker for you, wait til patch day and then give it a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1520804763, "timestamp_updated": 1520804763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40748035": {"recommendationid": "40748035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014525041", "num_games_owned": 570, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2007, "last_played": 1521743863}, "language": "english", "review": "I cannot recommend this game enough.

co-op experience. Initially, my partner and I pirated this game and played it through (Sorry!

It's a beat-em-up designed from ground up for co-op, yet plays fine solo too. The arenas are huge, the enemies are varied, attacking over various areas with various patterns, the pace is all Castle Crashers or TMNT arcade, but the core combat is something unique.\n\nYou have four characters with different movesets, two melee fighters, two ranged fighters. They only have one basic attack string, but they have a few command moves on top of that for dodging, turret laying, heavy attacks, or what have you. The command moves can cancel... this is important, so important the game stops you and tells you about it twice. A lot of the game is footsies, then, trying to get past enemy attacks and hit your combo on them and cancel into a command move to either get out of there from the other enemies closing in or to get some air juggle bonus damage on the enemy you smacked. The result will never be as crazy as a Platinum game but is far more thoughtful than Castle Crashers ever was. Even better, you unlock alternate attacks for basically every button/move for every character to give you some real customization.\n\nSolo play is done with a tag button, allowing you to swap between two characters.\n\nAs the Rogue Legacy devs did this, there is of course a massive meta grind of constantly pouring cash into your stats as well as leveling up each move, and a NG+ if your grind is that important to you to have another round of it. The need for buying grind points for each girl makes it tough to play as everyone, sadly.\n\nStill, a fine game, with friends or by yourself, it's certainly not a blend of game design you've seen in this genre before.", "timestamp_created": 1519023394, "timestamp_updated": 1519023394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520548", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40211408": {"recommendationid": "40211408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025650730", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518055742}, "language": "english", "review": "Best coop beat-em up Ive played\nTeamwork actually required\nDiverse playstyles\n\n>only thing is the riddles get ridiculous after the first world and require a guide or gl hf dumping a year into solving them", "timestamp_created": 1519007614, "timestamp_updated": 1519007614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40211258": {"recommendationid": "40211258", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976835021", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519432973}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is amazing.

Unlike a lot of games in this subgenre, it's got four characters that all play very differently and have their own equipment and skill unlocks. Both of those add even more variety to the game - equipment unlocks add all sorts of advantages and drawbacks to your attacks, and skills progress through smaller versions of Rogue Legacy's stat tree. \n\nMost of the stages are about three screens of increasingly difficult fights against standard enemies (of which there are probably around 10 species) followed by a boss. These can get very difficult, but you keep any currency you gained before dying, and there are plenty of optional levels, so you've got options if toughing it out isn't quite your style. Combat is theoretically pretty simple since you only have four attacks, but they do a fantastic job of shaking up scenarios to prevent you from ever getting comfortable with a strategy, and the skill ceiling is very high. \n\nNormally these kinds of games are only really satisfying in co-op, but Full Metal Furies gets around that by letting you pick two characters in single-player. You can instantly swap between them at any time using R2, which opens up all sorts of interesting possibilities for comboing and balancing health. Enemies will often spawn with a shield that can only be destroyed by one of your characters, and those shields can change color as they take damage, so learning to swap well is absolutely necessary to progress. It's a great system. \n\nI don't think anyone plays this genre for the stories, but FMF is actually pretty solid on that front as well. It has a very silly sense of humor that almost always worked for me, but everything is skippable if you'd rather it just stayed out of the way. Regardless, none of the scenes are very long. \n\nUnfortunately, while I always had enough currency to level up both of my characters (Sniper and Engineer) once or twice after missions, I don't think it's possible to keep more than your player count up to level without replaying levels. I didn't have a problem with that, because I loved playing a team of all glass cannons, but mileage may vary.

That said, it's also really, really goddamn hard. Don't be fooled, this isn't just Castle Crashers' cousin; this game is a brawler + a shoot 'em up, where you're typically going to be 3-hit in the most convoluted, evil battle scenarios and boss fights.\n\nPlenty of unique levels, content, gear customisation, stats to go deeper into your character, secrets to uncover, challenges to complete, bosses to conquer. A good level of polish to the sprites, environments and artwork in general. Each character is incredibly unique in their playstyle -- like, absolutely no overlay between them and, depending on what gear you put on your character, you can vary and specify your playstyle to a fine point.\n\nThere's some questionable writing here and there, typically running with the lowest-common-denominator joke and delivery, but it's all in good fun and doesn't detract from the game or the nature of the story itself -- worth reading if you want to feel a little more invested in the characters and surrounding world.\n\nMy only real issues with this game are from the difficulty. I know that sounds like a limp-wristed thing to say, don't worry. But the sheer length of some fights and the composition/design of some enemies [i]really[/i] digs into your skull when every second is a painful reminder that this game wants to kick you to the ground. Beating the odds for 5 minutes, only to be backhand-slapped from half health, then knowing you have to repeat the fight, is something that requires both a lot of skill and a lot of mental fortitude to get over.\n\nAside from that, I do feel the difficulty is aided by the often apparent amount of visual cluster. There will be you, several enemies, coloured shields, flashing sprites, telegraphed warning icons, explosions, solid environmental objects, bullets, bullets, bullets, dashing effects, a gigantic boss, massive laserbeams, invisible snipers, etc. It can be incredibly hard knowing where you are. In fact, when playing with my friend, we both play with colourblind mode [i]on[/i], despite having no problems with our eyes, just so we can have the added benefit (despite being more cluster) of seeing drawn lines between [i]us[/i] and the coloured enemies that we're assigned to kill, so we don't lose track.\n\nNot a perfect game, but still remarkably underrated.", "timestamp_created": 1518925111, "timestamp_updated": 1518925373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461538", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40173682": {"recommendationid": "40173682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009434648", "num_games_owned": 1098, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 422, "last_played": 1521163826}, "language": "english", "review": "A rock solid couch co-op.

There are some other issues here and there, but the gameplay itself is beyond reproach. The four classes that you have access to are quite distinct: each has four separate abilities, and each ability has four total variants. You can also \"level up\" each variant to gain an account-wide bonus (bonuses that will apply even if you switch characters) to HP, attack damage, special attack damage, and gold find. Lastly, you can use the gold that you find to put points in your skill tree. The skill tree allows you to either modify or enhance your abilities, or can give you a flat bonus to either your health, attack damage, or special attack damage.\n\nUnfortunately, I felt that many of the ability variants were clearly inferior to others, and found that many of the skills in my skill tree weren't very interesting. With the sniper class that I played (Meg), I changed my grappling hook to a shield bubble, but otherwise used her starting abilities for the entirety of the game. In other abilities and skills there seemed to be this focus on shooting enemies out of the air for additional damage, but this just didn't seem like something I could execute reliably. One weapon option for Meg was a sniper rifle that took so long to reload that I thought it was jammed, and another sniper rifle that lacked a laser sight. As certain enemies in this game are quite small (turret bots) and others almost invisible (snipers), your laser sight is absolutely invaluable when it comes to making your shots count.\n\nThe other issue with the title, at least for my co-op partner and I, was the inclusion of a bunch of obtuse puzzles. To reach the actual end of the game, you'll need to input funky symbol passwords over and over again into these computers in the clouds. I think there are perhaps ten of these computers, and the clues for their solutions are found both in-game and out. It seems that players are expected to find \"stone tablets\" hidden in the game's levels in order to solve the puzzles. We stumbled upon a handful of them, but nowhere near every one. Luckily, we were able to scour Youtube and Steam forums for the solutions, but it was irritating to have our fun game periodically interrupted. Perhaps some players find this to be a fun scavenger hunt (one puzzle solution is found in the game's release trailer), but for us it was mostly exasperating.\n\nFortunately, none of this really matters, as the moment-to-moment gameplay is so engrossing. The game is tough, and will require you to use your abilities often and well. You'll learn which enemies to prioritize, and about each enemy's attack pattern and vulnerabilities. In addition, certain enemies will emerge with a shield of a certain color. The character of the corresponding color must put damage on that enemy before his or her co-op partners can begin damaging that enemy. Although I read that certain reviewers found this gimmicky, I thought it was absolutely genius. It enhances the amount of focus that combat requires - is your cooperative partner getting swarmed by enemies that only you can damage? At the end of every single play session, my co-op partner and I commented, \"man that was great.\" What else can you ask for in a game?\n\nThe game also has a great sense of humor. Each character has their own personality, and often we literally laughed out loud. The meta-commentary and randomness of some of the enemy encounters is really charming.

They are neccassary to be solved about 15+h in. (would be better if they were completly optional though).\n\nThe game is nicely polished, music, sound- and artwork just feel right!!

Join the discord, and grab a friend, because while the single player alone is solid enough to hold you through the game, it is best enjoyed with more players.\n\nTruly, this game has the potential to be the next best castlecrashers game to pop in and enjoy your friends at any time.\nPlus, most of the early-day bugs are gone, so if you heard any negativity from the croud going \"The game can't support online\" and stuff, the Developers are actively, and rapidly, fixing any and all problems. From the point of my purchase till now, I have seen almost every problem that arised vanish before my eyes, and the only ones that do remain are very minor. Plus, this was only about 2-3 weeks ago, so imagine what's going to be done over the next few months?\n\n\nTL;DR: The game isn't perfect, but it has a lot of potential.

It achieves quite a lot - it gives new life to an old-school genre from the 90s (Beat'em Ups), the gameplay has an amazing flow (smooth responses, big brawls with frantic action) that becomes really addicting fast, and also great silly sense of humor and likeable heroes and villains (if you are not too offended by all the silly humor and childish puns going on!). \n\nAnd above all, the multiplayer really shines! Just like the old Beat'em Ups, it's a bunch of fun to cover your buddy beat a lot of baddies together, but FMF adds it up with with different character classes, shields who can only be broken by specific players, revive and aggro mechanics and custom combos. That's all put together in hectic boss fights on a challenging and difficult game, but one that strangely doesn't feels too frustrating when you fail together and try again. Maybe because it's a joy to play together, and also because the RPG mechanics smoothe things a bit.\n\nAnd the end game is amazing. Behind all the ridiculous jokes, the silly dialogues and the frantic and non stop action, is hidden an epic (!) of complex puzzles(!!) and a reflection on the dangers and limits of ideology(!!!).\n\nMaybe the only thing that is holding this game of being an instant classic so far is its release. This game had a very bad launch, with nasty network bugs, and the absence of means to quick-play multiplayer with strangers (missing features like Online Matchmaking, or even a multiplayer Lobby). A Beta was sorely missed. The Devs have noticed these problems, though, and seem to be making a good job of quickly fixing what has to be fixed.\n\nAll put together, FMF is an amazing game, that seems like it was made with a lot of care, and you wouldn't be too surprised to see it in almost every 'Best of 2018' lists that are going out there.", "timestamp_created": 1517625427, "timestamp_updated": 1517625427, "voted_up":

This seemed similar to castle crashers, which we loved to death and figured it couldn't hurt to give it a go.\n\nThe gameplay is quite spectacular. Nobody ever feels left out or like the \"useless character\" that can often accompany these sorts of games. Each of the characters are unique and have a clear role, but you can change them up so much by mixing around your equipment, which is half the fun imo. The leveling system is solid, finding equipment is fun, puzzles are great and the dialogue is A+ material. Seriously, the one liners and the general humor is some of the best I've seen. \n\nI highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new co-op game to blast away with their friend or friends. I can't speak for the solo experience, but this certainly feels like a game you don't really play on your own.\n\nIt's a shame the game doesn't seem to be selling so well, it's quite a treasure.

Best enjoyed in co-op.\n\nI've been [i]trying[/i] to write a review for this game for a while now. But everytime, I just booted the game up instead and enjoyed it a bit more. Now that I've finished it twice with a friend, here are my humble opinions about the game. \n\nFull Metal Furies takes the traditional brawler formula and improves it greatly with its own style. The new mechanics that are introduced highly enhance the gameplay, and also encourage co-op to a degree. There are four characters that you can play with, and each character comes with their own set of arsenal and offers wildly different gameplay options. \n\nIf you are planning to play this game solo, you are allowed to select two characters, and can swap between them at any time. However, I [i]really[/i] recommend that you play this game with at least a friend, if possible a full party. As I've said, this game is best enjoyed co-op. \n\nThe game also offers some puzzles that are quite clever. Some of these puzzles require you to think out of the box a little, while some others hide in plain sight. Solving them was both challenging, and fun. Of course, if this is not something you'd like, you can always check out the guides section and get the answers from there directly. \n\nThe story is better than I expected. Actually, much better than I expected as I started the game with zero expectations of liking it at the first place. The humor is right on the spot; quite a few of the dialogues made us laugh out loud actually. And it doesn't overstay its welcome; it knows where / when to stop, and avoid taking it too far and have the opposite effect.\n\nThe graphics made me feel awkward at first, but I've grown to like the mixed style in time. If you don't like what you see, I can totally understand that, but you'll be missing a lot if graphics are the only reason that makes you not interested in the game. \n\nThe music; its soundtrack is almost 2 hours long and with 41 different tracks, and it never got old in our playthrough. I'm somewhat of a soundtrack junkie, and pay extra attention to the music of any game, and this one is simply excellent.\n\nFew of the players unfortunately experience networking issues apparently, but developers are at hard work trying to solve any issues that they find / are reported. We didn't experience such issues, and aside from some odd game bugs here and there, our playthroughs were steady. \n\nAs I've said at the beginning, if you are into brawlers and/or co-op,  I highly recommend this game. And don't forget that it is best enjoyed in co-op. All in all, I think this game is a gem. I hope you'll see it and enjoy it too.", "timestamp_created": 1517211867, "timestamp_updated": 1517211867, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39700559": {"recommendationid": "39700559", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991866183", "num_games_owned": 487, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517208232}, "language": "english", "review": "After Castle Crashers I was like, ehh, another brawler?\n\nBut this one is actually good.

Imagine the moments when you are being overwhelmed and a player comes down from the sky deus ex machina style to relieve you.  Or when things are going well until enough enemies are populated on screen for four players but suddenly two d/c. Those moments would have been golden for game variety.  \n\nAlso how about 2 player with the combo change mode you implemented for 1 player?  3 player combo change mode coud consist of everyone having the ability only to change to the color that has been excluded from the 3 \"primary\" color picks.  Don't know how much more code that would take, but with that variety in matchup style, you could encourage a purpusefully harder 2 player or 3 player experience repeating the same levels.  The player could be made responsible to cover all enemy color types in all player count combinations.  I could be useless but I couldn't find this feature with a friend connecting to my game.

The World, etc., then you will LOVE this game. I've always loved those games, but I was rarely able to finish them due to the repetitiveness of the levels and same-ish enemies, but this game takes all that and kicks it up a notch while remedying those gripes. The enemies are diverse and challenging each in their own way, the levels are varied and beautiful, and the challenge (IMO) doesn't come from just throwing wave after wave of clone mobs at you; the enemies are smart, they dodge you and don't just soak up damage like fodder, and they have skills that stack with each other to make each screen a CHALLENGE. This game makes you think on your feet and utilize all of your skills and combos. There's just a touch of RPG elements in there too with unlockable skills and items that change how you play, as well as stat upgrades and boosts. ON MY FIRST NIGHT OF PLAYING I PLAYED 5 HOURS STRAIGHT. IT'S LIKE THAT.\n\nMy only two gripes here are that there is no online lobby (invite only) currently, but there's a Discord with people always looking to match up, so if you don't have any local friends or steam friends with a copy, I'd suggest the DIscord. Also the resolution at 1080 or higher is less than perfect. The dialogue text becomes a little blurrier, but the action and character sprites don't seem to be affected (again, IMO).

Essentially, a side-scrolling brawler with RPG elements added, such as acquiring new gear that provide unique bonuses or skill augments, leveling up, talents trees, and permanent stat boosts as you level up and progress.\n\nPROS:\n+ 4 unique classes each with distinct play styles\n+ RPG elements give the game a lot of depth\n+ Weapon system encourages experimentation and exploration to find them\n+ Rogue-like aspect means you can eventually conquer harder levels by replaying previous ones to get gold and level up\n+ \"Bubble\" system, in single-player, adds a strategic layer to combat, forcing you to switch between characters to take down certain enemies\n\nCONS:\n- Difficulty of combat. While you can replay previous areas to level up, the combat is usually frantic and it can be hard to predict enemy attacks, especially when 2+ enemies attack at once (which is common). Combat feels a little sluggish/slow which is kind of frustrating.\n- No open online co-op. You have to play with friends locally or invite people from your friends list.\n- Need to replay earlier levels to tackle harder levels. While I like that you can eventually get stronger through pure attrition, it can sometimes get annoying to have to replay the same levels multiple times.\n- Not enough skill diversity. Would like it if they mapped more skills to other buttons to give your character more options in combat. You basically have attack, counter, power-attack, and dodge.\n- \"Bubble\" system is frustrating in co-op play. If an enemy is a certain color and your teammate of that same color is down, that enemy will not be stopped until that same color player is revived.\n\nThis game has a lot of potential. I can still say i'm enjoying it after 7+ hours of play but the difficultly along with the sluggishness of combat is a bit irritating. It's very close to scratching that brawler/RPG itch but just isn't quite there yet, for me. \n\nDespite my complaints, I would still highly recommend this to people that are a fan of the genre as it's one of the best ones to come along since Castle Crashers.", "timestamp_created": 1516833063, "timestamp_updated": 1516833374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39590785": {"recommendationid": "39590785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046664981", "num_games_owned": 522, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517338954}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1]\u00a1Las Furias en acci\u00f3n![/h1]\n\nSi os hablo de Cellar Door Games quiz\u00e1s algunos no sep\u00e1is a quienes me refiero, pero si os digo que se trata del mismo estudio que hace unos a\u00f1os nos brind\u00f3 aqu\u00e9l excelente rogue like titulado Rogue Legacy, la cosa cambia \u00bfverdad? Pues bien, este es su segundo trabajo, Full Metal Furies, un t\u00edtulo del g\u00e9nero beat 'em up, en el que eso s\u00ed, tambi\u00e9n ha participado en su creaci\u00f3n los chicos del estudio catal\u00e1n BlitWorks (Fez o Jet Set Radio) y eso se nota sobre todo en el argumento y los di\u00e1logos, como ya ver\u00e9is m\u00e1s abajo.\n\nLa premisa argumental en un juego de este tipo nunca suele ser nada del otro mundo m\u00e1s all\u00e1 que una excusa para lanzarnos a soltar mamporros. Pero este no es el caso, ya que rompiendo con esa t\u00f3nica, en Full Metal Furies contamos con una trama mucho m\u00e1s elaborada de lo habitual en un beat 'em up. Somos las Furias, un grupo de chicas guerreras que luchan en una eterna cruzada por devolver al inframundo a los terribles titanes, unos seres muy poderosos basados en la mitolog\u00eda griega. Pero no os asust\u00e9is, no es una trama pesada, sino al contrario, muy f\u00e1cil de digerir pues en ella impera el humor m\u00e1s absoluto, con unos di\u00e1logos cargados de cachondeo y que en muchas ocasiones ser\u00e1n desternillantes (en otras ingeniosos a m\u00e1s no poder). Pero por encima de todo, muy bien escritos y perfectamente traducidos a nuestro idioma, se nota mucho el trabajo de los barceloneses BlitWorks en todo lo relacionado con la historia del videojuego.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1279204646\n\nPero pasemos al aspecto que m\u00e1s importa, su jugabilidad. Como ya os digo, se trata de un beat 'em up y el soltar galletas a diestro y siniestro ser\u00e1 una constante. Es un juego muy pensado para jugar en compa\u00f1\u00eda de nuestros amigos (en red u online) y ser\u00e1 posible juntarnos hasta 4 al mismo tiempo. No en vano, el grupo protagonista est\u00e1 compuesto por 4 chicas, cada una con sus distintas habilidades diferenciadoras. De todas formas, tambi\u00e9n es perfectamente viable (y divertido) jugar en solitario, el juego se adapta a ello, aunque se nos obligar\u00e1 a jugar con dos personajes, pudiendo cambiar entre ambos muy r\u00e1pido con tan solo pulsar un bot\u00f3n, creando as\u00ed estrategia entre nuestros dos personajes en forma de combos y dem\u00e1s. Si caemos podremos resucitarnos con el otro personaje (o nuestros amigos si jugamos en coop), fallando la misi\u00f3n solo si todos los personajes caen.\n\nOtro aspecto muy destacable de Full Metal Furies es que, debajo de su aparente simpleza, esconde un juego muy elaborado que combina el g\u00e9nero beat 'em up con el del rpg, as\u00ed pues, mientras vamos avanzando por su trama e infinidad de misiones secundarias, iremos adquiriendo experiencia, oro, subiendo niveles y desbloqueando multitud de habilidades y equipo para nuestros personajes. Lo que al principio parecen solo unas pocas y simples habilidades o equipos a desbloquear, pronto se transforma en m\u00faltiples formas de cambiar y mejorar a nuestras guerreras a medida que subimos niveles y desentra\u00f1amos los much\u00edsimos secretos que esconde el juego.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1280342241\n\nY es que esa es otra, Full Metal Furies est\u00e1 plagados de contenidos que poco a poco descubriremos, incluso sus escenarios, lejos de ser los t\u00edpicos de este genero, no consistes solo en avanzar hacia delante, en muchos de ellos hay bifurcaciones y zonas secretas, lo que hace que tambi\u00e9n sea un juego de exploraci\u00f3n. Adem\u00e1s, suelen ser variad\u00edsimos, no solo en aspecto, sino tambi\u00e9n en lo que hacemos en ellos.

I enjoy the difficulty, as it is a bit harder than others in the genre, and the game plays excellently solo as well as co-op (online play works flawlessly too!).

With it being so obviously designed for co-op play I thought it may not hold up too well in single-player. Whereas I did play some local co-op, more often than not I was playing solo and actually really enjoyed it. \n\nThe ability to pick two characters to switch between is a brilliant mechanic and stops the combat from getting stale. With how levelling works in the game it's possible to level up all characters evenly and switch between them regularly, too (though I imagine you'd be strongest if you just focused on two characters instead).  \n\nOne of my favourite aspects was the progression system, in fact, as it feels really satisfying to level up your abilities and gear, and doesn't take too long to do so. I think this was what really kept me hooked. I've written a [url=http://www.indiegamewebsite.com/2018/01/20/full-metal-furies-review/]full review of Full Metal Furies[/url] elsewhere if you'd like to read it.

Alex is the whirlwind fighter who gets feverishly into the thick of things and grows in utility as you master her counter-attack and Meg's the backline powerhouse, who deals serious damage but requires a level of mastery to play well (so definitely take note of the difficulty STARS when choosing a character for the first time - or make sure you've a strong front-line partner to work with).\n\nThe skill trees expand the play range and agency of each character - honing them more compitently into their team role as you learn their style (which is where the RPG component comes into play). A low level Triss, for example, feels really basic in the early game as you learn the basic combos, and have to deal with shield breaking - but as you climb the tree, your talent selections give you comeback, shielding, reflecting and damage negation tweaks that reinforce her \"Tank\" role and expand the groove of being the shield-weilding frontliner.\n\nThe equipment blueprints and masteries are an impressive addition. Equipment changes the way a particular ability plays in general - which at the start is helpful to refine a playstyle that lets you learn the game and the character. As you become more proficient, the mastery system encourages you to switch gear, and learn each new styles to benefit from the stat gains that come from leveling up the item. Both these systems are incredibly sophisticated ways to keep the game feeling new, and addictive - unlike every other \"brawler\" I've played before, where characters are all the same, and stay stale for the entire game - making it a chore to play by the end. The RPG twist to the genre, with attention to the meaningful action-oriented upgrades ensures you're involved in the gameplay decisions and are constantly learning, adapting and gaining \"mastery\" as you play. It never gets old.\n\nEnemies are impressive, each offers a clear challenge, with strong AI patterns that are recognizable and comprehensive and that in combination with other enemies, create the ever-expanding difficulty. Even similar enemies later that may look, on the surface, like pallete swaps have additional, and important moves that make them an entirely new challenge. The barrier system is also really smart. While it may initially SEEM artificial, it is a critical part of the game that makes Co-Op ACTUALLY MATTER! Unlike other games of the type, where one good player can just carry you through - the mechanic forces each player to become an important part of the team. In difficult stages, where weaker characters need to take action, it creates a compelling sense of comeradery as teammates have to work together to lock down untouchable enemies, or protect their needed partners so they can get in to break the shield. It's compelling and makes each encounter feel incredibly, co-operatively dynamic!\n\nThe writing and story in the game are also something to take note of. Clever, witty banter and puns-within-puns ripple through not just the dialogue in the game, but the menus and overlays as well; giving the game a fun, tongue-and-cheek tone. It's easy with a group of players to want to skip the banter... but if you can, take the time to read it through - there are some good lines that can catch you off-guard, and, as you dive deeper - there is a story that is remarkably and intelligently connected - if you're paying attention. Everything is carefully crafted and expressed - and it can be easy to overlook - not that the game suffers if you do - but it speaks to the depth and the levels this game has. There is care and craft here that the developers have put into expressing a holistic and powerful game experience.\n\nFinally, the puzzles. As a player, they sit on the edge of confusion for a long time - why are there puzzles in this game? Do they matter? Isn't this game just about hitting stuff, and hitting more stuff? Well, I won't spoil anything here, but just as the dialogue feeds the experience with care, the puzzles do the same. And they are fun, mental challenges that once you solve or decipher are often personally rewarding and an unexpected surprise. The game doesn't insult your intelligence, and provides in-game clues to everything - it simply asks you to think outside the box from time to time - which is incredibly rewarding.\n\nI played through the game first with a co-op partner (2P). The back and forth combos, the teamwork, the revive loops were all gratifying and intense experiences that I will remember! \n\nI've played only the first couple worlds again solo ( as Triss/Erin) and in 4P with my friends (as Meg...HARD MODE!) and each experience has been different and uniquely fun. Solo, it's a pretty satisfying experience to swap and combo between characters for chaining air-crits or save yourself after one character goes down, and in 4P, evading the chaotic bullet-hell of certain fights is nail biting - but every time is a good time.\n\nIf you haven't played the game yet, and any of the action from the videos looks like it's up your alley - give it a shot.

But don't get it twisted, I wouldn't review if I didn't feel like I understand exactly what this is.[/i]\n\n[b][i]Full Metal Furies[/i] is a fresh take on the Beat'em Up genre.[/b] The fighting mechanics are super tight, and work really well. That part is great - and other Beat'em Up games should be taking notes. The controller support is nice too. Other veteran players say that the skill ceiling is quite high, and I totally believe them. I kept getting better and better even over the short time period. Great.\n\nNow onto what I think doesn't work.\n\nThe pixel art pieces placed on the 'smooth' art background feels off; perhaps 'bland' is the feeling that comes to mind. Okay, it's just aesthetics so lets move past that. The storyline is pretty 'meh' to me and I quickly found myself skipping through it. The one line jokes are... Not great. Okay, fine. I wish this were more classic action RPG instead of more Beat'em Up. What I mean is that I wish there were randomized loot, an open-ish world to explore (instead of corridors with barrels and boxes on repeat), and less of the 'puzzles' which were  hardly groundbreaking to say the least.  \n\n[b]They say single player is just as prominent as multiplayer - but I can't shake the feeling that it was still pieced together as an afterthought.[/b] Really, how could it not be? I would find it mind boggling to have a game that is *equally* good/fun with four players versus one; apples and oranges, really. Now, single player [i]is[/i] fairly well done, but c'mon guys this is best (and was intended for first and foremost) with four people sitting in the same room.

The grind. [i]Rogue Legacy[/i] had the meta-upgrades that ended up with a game mechanic that was simply a giant grind. It's very much alive and well in this title too. I knew this going in, so I am not going to dump on it too much, but something always feels slightly cheap to me about that approach. I don't know if the word is 'artificial difficulty' or what, but the idea that it's nearly impossible to finish it on the first run (or first few) just sits strange with me. To be fair, the devs said they could take a fresh build and get quite far (they didn't say 'finish' it, from what I read).\n\n[b]Really, it comes down to the asking price being the deal breaker for me.[/b] While they [i]say[/i] single player is strong - I disagree. And I've played a ton of local couch co-op games, and have a lot of love for that category - and very few of them ever ask $20.\n\n[i]Not a bad game at all.

It is a wonderful game that has quite a bit of depth, the story is funny enough, the music is superb, and it is all made better with a friend. I only complain, as many others do, that the netcode in this game at launch is absolutely atrocious. My friend and I were trying to play together and there skipping for me regardless of who was hosting and then there were times where we could ressurect eachother because one of us would be invisible to the other. Also there were times where the enemies would skip around making it impossible to predict attacks. This can definitely be solved with patches, but it amazes me that it is so terrible. If you're playing solo, the game flawlessly, but you lose out on half the fun. Knowing that it was a small team and that they already released a patch two days after release, I have hopes it will be fixed. And for that matter I can reccommend, though I would wait to see a netcode update patch if you plan to play online with friends.", "timestamp_created": 1516461227, "timestamp_updated": 1516461227,

Turns out this is by those gods that created Rouge Legacy, one of my favorite rouge-likes.  THIS GAME IS AMAZING! I've only played a couple hours of it but am already completely hooked.  It's basically a side scroller beat em up, but with a huge emphasis on strategy and team work. It can be difficult at first, but each gameover offers you stat leveling and gold. So even if you die multiple times on one level you are still being rewarded. It is a fun single player experience, but AN ABSOLUTE BLAST as 4 PLAYER COOP, both offline and online.  This music is great, the story pretty entertaining, and some great pixel art.

Initially I wasn't too impressed with the choice of a coop based beat em up, but boy, is this game awesome.\n\nThe game has a distinct visual style, and I love the art direction and character design. Everyone has its own charm. Great pixel art characters are put on (hand drawn?) higher resolution scenarios and the result is very pretty for the eyes. Texts and some other elements are a bit blurry, but playing on a full HD monitor I didn't find this problem annoying in the slightest. I barely even notice if we're speaking about scenarios, while it's more noticeable with texts. OST is amazing. A Shell in the Pit has equalled, if not surpassed, the work already done with Rogue Legacy's OST.\n\nThe plot is not incredible, as expected from the genre, but from a certain point in the campaign it gets you and becomes pretty interesting. The second half is definitely very good, with more serious themes and some real epicness thrown in the mix. The problem (and I'd say the only problem with the game, aside from network problems which I didn't experience as I played only local coop) is that the writing is pretty inconsistent. The game doesn't take itself seriously for the most part, and there is a lot of humour. Sometimes they got it right, or really right, and it will put a smile on your face or make you laugh a bit, but sometimes (especially in the first part of the campaign, afterwards it gets better) the humour is just so cringeworthy. It's not a big problem in a game like this but it's noticeable. Overall, decent plot with some great protagonists. I love the Furies.\n\nNow for the gameplay: after playing both solo and in couch co-op, I have to say that playing this game is just pure fun and satisfaction. The experience is pretty different thanks to the class swap mechanics, which makes solo play more satisfying yet demanding in terms of skill ceiling. By choosing two classes and alternating them on the fly, you can execute your own custom combos and dish out crazy amounts of damage. Trying all the character/skill combinations is endless fun, and pulling off crazy manouvers is so satisfying it never gets old. Managing the cooldowns of your skills will be essential. In this mode, a bit of grinding may be required, but only if you're levelinng up all the gear and the characters evenly. \n\nCo-op is simpler in a way, but also pure exhilarating mayhem. Building the chemistry with your partner and finding the perfect combination of characters is the core of the fun, and after a few minutes you'll be hooked. My experience has been this way: we both picked a character we liked after a few experiments, and stuck with them for the rest of the game. It was incredible to see ourselves become masters of our abilities and tools on the way. As a result, we'll surely replay the game with the other two characters.\n\nSecrets and puzzles are pretty complex and satisfying to solve/discover, I definitely didn't expect such hard puzzles in a brawler. Some of them are really creative, too. You'll have to think way outside the box. There are also some hidden pieces of equipment, sometimes hidden a bit too well. I would have loved an hint system for finding some of the more elusive treasures in addition of the hints for the Stone Tablets. \n\nOverall the progression and the four abilities system makes this brawler deeper than most, and that's why it isn't boring even after extended sessions. This game is a gem with just few issues (and the networking ones will most likely be fixed soon). Absolutely recommended. Easily an 8.5 if you play solo, 9/10 if you can manage to play both solo and in local coop with a trusted buddy.\n\nP.S.: the last three bosses are absolutely mindblowing.", "timestamp_created": 1516405795, "timestamp_updated": 1516749365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543086", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39470086": {"recommendationid": "39470086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086773851", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519586468}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played about 2 hours of this with 2 player local co op and I'm leaving this review here as a placeholder because so far, I absolutely love this game.\n\nGreat class based beat em up that is actually really challenging.

The music is spectacular, the art direction is great, and the level mechanics are surprisingly deep as well. Playing with 1 other person, the game has ran flawlessly every single time. When I add more though, the host seems to suffer from framerate drops, some weird animation bugs, inability to see/res other players, and general lag. Cellar Door has taken on a big project releasing something like this without a large scale beta test, and because of this we are seeing the results. Does this make the game bad? NO.

I am simply chiming in to praise what I've seen so far.

There's no manual checkpoint, if you mess up you have two options either return to base camp and restart the entire mission or die and restart from checkpoint\nIf you know things are already going south this would be a huge time-saver to be able to manually restart from checkpoint\n\n4.

The music is amazing, although sometimes it does fade in the background during all the chaos of combat when you hear it it is amazing when I first started up the game I spent a solid 40 minutes just listening to the menu music and I'm highly thinking of buying the OST\n\n2. The visuals are also impressive each enemy is visibly different and they choreograph their attacks and movement quite well everything is soft but solid you can tell what everything is\n\n3.

Everything is nice and simple but using the simple controls you can pull off some pretty complex stuff and basically juggle enemies around the battlefield when you get some skill\n\nAll in all this is a really fun game and I highly recommend buying it especially if you have friends who also have it( it's like Castle Crashers but with roles)\n\nI don't know what the developers have planned but I hope they do have more characters in the future not that that's an issue but I would just like more classes or just new people personally", "timestamp_created": 1516380610, "timestamp_updated": 1516380718, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497175", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39462290": {"recommendationid": "39462290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040962787", "num_games_owned": 464, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516541399}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ucee8\ud2b8\ub864+\ub178\uac00\ub2e4+\ucf54\uc635 \uc0bc\uc704\uc77c\uccb4\uac00 \ud4e8\uc804\ub41c, \uad1c\ucc2e\uac8c \ub9cc\ub4e0 \uc544\ucf00\uc774\ub4dc\ud48d \uc561\uc158\uac8c\uc784.\n\n\uc815\uc2e0\uc5c6\ub294 \ud2b8\uc708 \uc2a4\ud2f1 \uc288\ud130\uae09\uc740 \uc544\ub2c8\uc9c0\ub9cc \uadf8\uc5d0 \uc900\ud558\ub294 \uba40\ud2f0\ud0dc\uc2a4\ud0b9\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ubbc0\ub85c \uc81c\ubc95 \uc804\ud22c\uac00 \ucac4\uae43\ud558\ub2e4. \ubb34\uc801 \ud68c\ud53c\uae30\ub098 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uae30\uc220\ub4e4\uc774 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \ucfe8\ud0c0\uc784 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uacb0\uad6d \uc9e4\uc9e4\uc774\uc640 \ud68c\ud53c\uc5d0 \ub2a5\uc219\ud574\uc838\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc190\uace0\uc790\ub3c4 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc800\ub09c\uc774\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub4dc\uac00 \uc788\uae34 \ud55c\ub370 \uace8\ub4dc \ud398\ub110\ud2f0\uac00 \uc788\uc73c\ubbc0\ub85c \uac8c\uc784 \ube44\uc219\ub828\uc790\ub97c \uc2ac\ud504\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ubd80\ubd84\uc774\ub2e4.\n\n\uc194\ud50c\ub3c4 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uae34 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc804\ud22c\uac00 \ubc8c\uc5b4\uc9d0\ub140 \ud2b9\uc815 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\uc5d0\uac8c\ub9cc \ub370\ubbf8\uc9c0\ub97c \uc785\ub294 \uc2e4\ub4dc\uac00 \ub2ec\ub9b0 \uc801\ub4e4\uc774 \ub5bc\uac70\uc9c0\ub85c \ub364\ube44\ub294 \ud615\uad6d\uc774 \ub418\uae30 \uc2ed\uc0c1\uc774\ubbc0\ub85c \ucf54\uc635\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc815\uc2e0, \uc548\uad6c \ubc0f \uc190\uac00\ub77d \uad00\uc808 \uac74\uac15\uc5d0 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub41c\ub2e4. \uac19\uc774 \ud560 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc774 \uc5c6\ub2e4\uba74 \ubc18\ubcf5 \uc219\ub2ec\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uce90\ub9ad\ud130 \uc2a4\uc651\uacfc \uc2a4\ud0ac \ucfe8\ud0c0\uc784 \uacc4\uc0b0\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\ub4e4\uc744 \ub3c4\ub959\ub0b4\ub294 \uace0\uc778\ubb3c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud654\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud558\uc790.\n\n\ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\ub97c \uad8c\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc778\ub370 LB LT\ub97c \uc804\ud600 \uc548 \uc4f0\ub294\uac78\ub85c \ubd10\uc11c\ub294 \ub290\ub08c \uc384-\ud55c \uac83\uc774 \uc544\ub9c8 \ub2cc\ud150\ub3c4 \uc2a4\uc704\uce58\ub85c \uc870\ub9cc\uac04 \ucd9c\uc2dc\ud560 \uac83 \uac19\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1516380100, "timestamp_updated": 1516380157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641888", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39462242": {"recommendationid": "39462242", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969639504", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516380845}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u6c42\u968a\u53cb\u554a!!!!\u597d\u73a9\u8b9a!!", "timestamp_created": 1516379951, "timestamp_updated": 1516379951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39461785": {"recommendationid": "39461785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042851962", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516433506}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd8\u4e0d\u9519.\u6709\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u8d77\u73a9\u7684\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1516378583, "timestamp_updated": 1516378583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39461654": {"recommendationid": "39461654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137377981", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 122, "last_played": 1521653517}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud30c\uc139\uc73c\ub85c \uc6d0\ud560\ud558\uac8c \uad6c\ub3d9\uac00\ub2a5!

Everyone has their time to shine!\n\nYou also have co-op mode, where you and 3 other friends against Titans. [b] ATTENTION [/b] To play online you have to befriend randoms... BUT FEAR NOT! They have made an official Discord server so everyone can get people to play, turning randoms into Beat'em up friends!\n\nTo finish this review, Full Metal Furies has alot of potential, brings hours of gameplay and it's better with friends (since you fight against Titans and against each other to see who can get the hero you all like)!

Will fill in later as I get to play more.\n\nAfter fixing the fact that the game used the integrated graphic card instead of the gaming one on my laptop I had no more technical issues (you actually need a real graphic card to be able to play this game at reasonable FPS, laptop onboard won't do, not even Kaby Lake with an i7 processor. \n\nI played only in 2 players so far, cleared several areas after the first boss. We are both enjoying the game a lot so far. It's worth pointing out this game doesn't have a Rogue Legacy like progression system. When you die, you lose nothing and just continue from the same area ( checkpoints are everywhere ). So far it doesn't feel like items and talents add a ton of customization variety to the characters, so that type of variety didn't pass over from Rogue Legacy either. Maybe this gets better later on.\n\nThe gameplay is still very fun, and the teamplay aspect is as real as they advertise it. At first we were completely lost about how things work and what we should be doing, but after a couple of hours we started to get the hang of it. I realized the tank can actually block aoe, and everything with her shield, even often while pointing in the wrong direction, and from that point on everything was much easier. Currently in the second area, after an hour or so, we didn't die once yet, and I needed 200 deaths to beat Rogue Legacy, so I'm not a very skilled action game player. The game could end up being on the easy side, but we will see.\n\nThe music is great, the ingame art is fantastic as usual.\n\nOne thing I dislike is the way the story progresses, with a lot of click through dialogue that makes it almost feel like a visual novel at times. Rogue Legacy had subtle humor, and the story was served in small chunks as filler, rather than interrupting your gameplay every few minutes. Also, every line from every character tries so hard to sound funny, and for the most part, it doesn't succeed. Also as beautiful the ingame graphics and Kotaki's pixel art are, the dialogue art for the characters feels crude and cheap. \n\nI also don't like the fact I was charged 20 euros rather than $20 for the game, because US $ is currently 0.82 of euro. But this is probably Steam charging policy. Still worth pointing out to potential buyers out there. $24 is not a small amount for an indy game, but I still think  it's worth it. \n\nSo far 8/10. It's a different genre from Rogue Legacy, it's a team game to play with friends for the most part, but due to it's learning curve and initial difficulty it might not be the party game where casual and non-gamer buddies get a controller and everyone has fun.

I've only played local, so it's doesn't apply to me**\n\nOK ANYWAY\n\nThis is a pretty awesome take on brawlers. They do a couple cool new things to make the moment to moment gameplay more interesting.\n\n1. First, if you're playing single player you get to pick TWO heroes not one. This leads to some interesting combos of attacks. There's animation cancels you can do. You get crits for juggling people. You'll catch yourself swapping back and forth while your other hero's moves are on cool down.\n2. The unlocks you get change the gameplay quite a bit. Early example: You can change your DPS's jump so that it goes way higher and has a longer cooldown. BUT it has a much larger radius and knocks people up into the air for juggle combos.\n\n\nOk onto the questionable things.\n1. The dialogue and humor kind of sucks. It's a cross between bad puns and \"fellow kids\". LUCKILY someone on the dev team knows this and there is an option where you can disable ALL non-critical dialogue.\n\n2. I worry it's going to have that brawler problem where you can have under-leveled characters. Like if you don't enjoy the sniper character, but you NEED her later on. You'll have to go back to early levels just to grind for gold and XP.

I've only played two-player so far, but found the whole experience extremely compelling. It gets super hard at times, so be prepared to die... a lot. There is an easier difficulty, but I haven't bothered with it yet.\n\nLuckily there's a whole host of upgrade mechanics to smooth out the difficulty curve, from a Rogue Legacy style leveling system unique to each character, to passive usage-based stat gains, to a skill customization system with a lot of fun variance. It's rare to find a beat-em-up with this level of customization, and I really appreciate it in this game.\n\nThe art's also completely gorgeous, and the soundtrack is superb.\n\nOne word of warning: the netcode might be a bit dodgy. Check recent reviews to see if they've fixed the issue yet.\n\nOverall, if you've got a couch full of friends and have been looking for a good alternative to Castle Crashers, Full Metal Furies is 100% worth a look.", "timestamp_created": 1516288735, "timestamp_updated": 1516288735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39437136": {"recommendationid": "39437136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046175481", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516551392}, "language": "english", "review": "That game feels awesome.", "timestamp_created": 1516285015, "timestamp_updated": 1516285015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39436364": {"recommendationid": "39436364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003584235", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520181977}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "everything is training for [airshot]\n", "timestamp_created": 1516282551, "timestamp_updated": 1516282551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39435647": {"recommendationid": "39435647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192020215", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516457606}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6765\u6ce2\u597d\u53cb", "timestamp_created": 1516280539, "timestamp_updated": 1516280539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39434824": {"recommendationid": "39434824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037465337", "num_games_owned": 538, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516273361}, "language": "english", "review": "I really like the character art and animations, the time put into designing skill trees and upgrades. There is nice music and all female cast feels refreshing. I also liked the idea of color shielding enemies, but it kinda backfires when one player of certain colour is down and rest gets smacked down because they can't hurt the enemies or revive a friend in timely manner. \n\nYou can tell a lot of work and heart went into making of this game. Unfortunately gameplay is frustrating and not well balanced. I've played in single player mode as well as 4 player co-op, and after finishing first map (5ish levels + a boss fight) noone wanted to play anymore.  \n\nThe gameplay is based on canceling abilities/attacks and making combos with other players (i.e. one throws enemy into the air and the second on shoots him down for an Air Crit attack), which works well in theory, but it's hard to coordinate those actions due to weird timing of the cooldowns. Sometimes it makes dodging enemies impossible and some characters feel super unresponsive. Maybe it's the lack of input buffering or something like that.In example if a few enraged enemies target your character there is now way to dodge them or avoid the attack. \n\nAiming with the sniper would use aim snap or something like that since with very sensitive gamepad there is no way to be super precise across the entire screen and make a shot before other character's attack blows the enemies all over the place. \n\nLevel design is uinteresting and unrewarding - each level is pretty much the same with few encounters and a frustrating enviro damage section or \"the foreground covers entire screen\" section. Scrolling \"bullet hell\" sections don't work great if camera bounds are blocking the player movement. If one player is at the bottom of the screen and he dies, he stops all the others at the top - and in those sections this means entire squad dies and you have to replay it all over again. Also if the readibility of the game isn't great (lot of characters, a lot of actions) please don't add the show covering additional parts of the screen or foreground elements. \n\nThere are \"secrets\" hidden on the levels but nobody really cared about those. The same with the story - game is just covered in dialogues and it doesn't fit the frantic gameplay at all. There is an opition in the menu to disable the non-essential dialogues tho, which is a plus. \n\nGame HuB is interesting, and works well in the single player mode, but for few players at the same time it's just a giant mess - the upgrade screens clutter the screen, not everything can be upgraded (some actions may be performed by every player, some only by game's Host), but even tho all players have access to the screens which do nothing but clutter the screen. \n\nI guess having full-resolution backgrounds and pixel art characters and destructibles was readibility choice, but in full HD all menus and backgrounds are pixelated anyway. Sometimes it's hard to tell which elements are destructible and which aren't. You should be able to destroy low-res objects, but there are some high-res walls which you need to destroy that doesn't stand out of the environment at all. Readibility of the characters is poor and with a lot of enemies on screen it's hard to see who is where and it makes it very hard to dodge the attacks or bullets. \n\nThere is some fun to be had in the game and I think it has potential, but in my opinion it needs a lot of work on the gamefeel and usability before I could recommend it to anyone.", "timestamp_created": 1516277605, "timestamp_updated": 1516277605, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621044", "comment_count": "12", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39433338": {"recommendationid": "39433338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035719902", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518867327}, "language": "english", "review": "Rogue Legacy is one of my all-time favourites - Full Metal Furies has a lot to live up to.\n\nPleasingly, FMF feels absolutely brilliant.

Buying the tunes on Bandcamp was an absolute no-brainer.\n\nThe only negative is the lack of visual clarity when displayed in 1920x1080. This makes reading the text a bit uncomfortable. While the pixel-art style masks the slightly blurred visuals, FMF would be even greater with an extra layer of sharpness.\n\nAbove all else, FMF features great action, an awesome soundtrack, and

The writing is brisk, clever, and fun. The gameplay is tight and engaging, and the design of the game is one of enthusiastic cooperation, even if you're playing by yourself. From Ikaruga style color swapping between characters in singleplayer to team tactics in multiplayer, the game doesn't disappoint on the application of its \"gimick\". Couple the unique flavor and cool world design with the crunchy, satisfying gameplay mechanics and you have a strong game, made better by its progression system which doles out just enough to encourage trying new playstyles without feeling like the core of the gameplay is getting smothered under farming or completion hunting. I have no complaints about this game other than the UI being a bit distorted looking (may be intentional, but it's a little bit jarring) and that some levels have inconsistent difficulty and length in unexpected ways.

It's missing many of the minor annoyances of the genre. However, it is much more difficult then some i've played, though ultimately, I'd guess, more forgiving then Cellar Door's previous title, Rogue Legacy. The RPG-style upgrade system certainly helps, as does the fact that you keep all gold obtained in levels- even that obtained during boss fights, as they drop gold whenever they reach a health threshold. Good stuff. Still, towards the end it started feeling rather unfair. If my friend had not  mastered Triss in just a few short sessions, I doubt I would have gotten far. As it is, I was most comfortable using Meg.\n\nThe game's asethetic is absolutely spon on. It has great music, lovely background art and great character designs, and also surprisingly entertaining writing. Triss' being done with everything, Alex's unabashed enthusiasm, Erin's need to educate her less well-read companions, and Meg's state of only partial wakeness and interest. They're all endearing. In addition, there is a deeper subgame involving the finding of ancient tablets and the solving of riddles I was curious to see where this went, but it eventually proved beyond my puzzling abilities to solve, as several of them require out of the box thinking and bring you to conclusions I could not possibly have drawn on my own. Again, my friend had to step in.\n\nStill, unlike say, Shovel Knight's DLC campaigns, or Cave Story's true ending path, Furies did not leave a bad taste in my mouth the way a lot of frustrating games do. I owe this to its presentation- it feels like reaching the end of a journey. As a kid who grew up reading of the Greek myths and enjoying beat em ups, Furies has a comforting familiarity to it.\n\nThere's a nifty ability to switch between two characters if you're playing solo, and mechanics that both make it easier to see whats happening and to encourage teamplay and coordination, like color-coded shields that only the corresponding character can break. It seems to have some issues with resolution- I've played with the graphics settings and its always a bit fuzzy. It also didn't seem to work with the Steam overlay at launch, though this appears to have been fixed. Also, aiming Meg's riflle with a 360 controller feels a tad awkward. But it's definitely playable. If you've been eagerly anticipating this title like me, and enjoy Beat-Em-Ups or Action-RPGs, go ahead and grab it now that its out. \n\nAs an end note, this game has already been heavily patched and Cellar Door seems to have a great deal of concern for it and its players, which is more then you can say for a lot of games.", "timestamp_created": 1516219666, "timestamp_updated": 1517545686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.790417", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39420310": {"recommendationid": "39420310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059242893", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516213922}, "language": "english", "review": "The game feels fun to play but the constant not good humor is too obstructive to keep playing.

Furies is a 1 to 4 Player Adventure-Beat'emup with RPG elements, controlling the Furies; an all girl squad.\nWith fast paced action and extremely tight controls, this game is extremely enjoyable and brutally hard.\nFour characters to choose from, ranging from melee to sniper, all with diverse skills and easy to pickup but tough to master.\nThe art style is great, blocky retro characters over crisp hi-res cartoon backgrounds. A genuinely comedic storyline and packed with charm and character.\n\nSimilar to Rogue Legacy (CellarDoors previous hit), the different enemies all have simple identifiable movesets and attack patterns. But the skill comes in fighting any combination of hordes of them at once!\n\nWe've had so much fun playing this so far, the game had us swearing with anger as it is consistently tough; but we never felt conned or ripped off. This led to us wanting just one more go. And another.\n\nIf you like your games hard, have a band of friends that like to cooperate, love the retro appeal or just fancy something different, this wont dissappoint.\n\nThis will be a future classic.. would love to see a physical release on switch .. wink wink.\n\nBen @ Spinning Wizard\n\nSidenote: despite running rx580s in crossfire, we had no performance issues whatsover. We never saw a bug and had a completely solid experience.

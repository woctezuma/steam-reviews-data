When I first downloaded it I wasn't very intrigued, due to how I felt making things, not getting things to line up properly, but after about ten minutes I made a neat helmet I could wear on my avatar. Still at this point I felt like it was too time consuming until I went to some people's worlds and saw the cool things they made. Eventually I reached a big reason why this game is so good I met two random people and they decided to take me and a few others on a crazy journey, basically we broke the game by flying around at supersonic speeds and had a great time.

The tools allow you to script anything you make or anything that has been made clonable. EVERYTHING you encounter in Anyland was created by the users in Anyland with the in world creation tools... so Anyland is as cool and interesting as we make it!\n \nThe social aspects are diverse but the ability to collaborate and share creations is exciting and inspiring to me. Going exploring into areas/worlds is made fun partially because you can collect cool items along the way and meet new people in crazy avitars created with the in world tools! \n\nIf you like the idea of creating and/or exploring and/or collecting and/or collaborating and/or socializing in unique environments... give Anyland at least 8 hours of your time (not in one day, unless thats your flow) and I think you'll understand it's potentials and value.", "timestamp_created": 1515525809, "timestamp_updated": 1515525809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38921065": {"recommendationid": "38921065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040869501", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 102, "last_played": 1516212926}, "language": "english", "review": "Sick stuff.

To start with, it is at once the easiest game I've ever played, and the hardest. The game doesn't set up any bad guys to beat, and there are no inherent missions to clear. You don't get a high-score, and you're never in danger of dying. You build things out of simple shapes. A table is a flat block and a four long blocks, a drink is a cylinder with liquid inside. The scripting is as simple as telling an object to do something when something else happens. On the surface, it seems to be nothing more than a cute social VR game, one where things a bit more customizable than others, but that's about it\n\nThat's easy mode.\n\nThen we have \"hard mode.\"\n\nWhen you really start getting into it, you'll find a game that is more intricate, more elaborate, more involved, and more open-ended than anything I've ever experienced before.\n\nMost people start with making an avatar, it's a good place to start, and deceptively simple. I've seen avatars that have a squirrel piloting a a WW11 aircraft for a head, one that looks like the Job Bot from Job Simulator, one that has a bird of a head and two birds for hands and nothing else, and a one that looks like a very classy robot. My own avatar has a rocket powered fist I can fire. I made it because I could, and because it pleased me, and for no other reason. You're only limited by your imagination and the amount of time and work you're willing to put into the things you make.\n\nLike guns? There are million to try out. Don't like any of the ones you find? Make your own. You can make it fire anything you want. Bullets, grenades, lazers, bubbles, lava, pigs. You make it, you can fire it.\n\nDon't like guns? Make anything else. Literally. Anything. Else. I made a forest. I also made some fish, they swim around in a little pond. I know someone who made a replica of the Disney Castle. Someone made a train you ride. For Halloween, some users made a Haunted Trail. It was jump scares and even an entrance to The Upside Down. There are worlds built around solving puzzles, worlds built to look beautiful, worlds built for playing games. Just the other day I saw a world where someone made a bubble machine with poppable bubbles.\n\nNot every world or item is great. Not every world or item is perfect, and that is why this game is \"hard.\" Every single thing I've mentioned so far was made by players. The Devs in this game are incredibly responsive to the community, and very interactive, but they only provide the tools. Literally just the tools. When you zone in for the first time, there's no tutorial. You just find yourself on a barren rock with nothing but a pair of hands and a ring on your thumb. There is a tutorial video on the ring you can watch from within the game, but it's nothing more than the basics of the basics. The devs don't want to restrict you on what you think you can do, everything is up to you. So the devs don't provide instruction--\n\nBut the other players do. I've never encountered such a positive community before in an online game. Sure, there are a few bad eggs, but those are very rare, and in over 100 hours of playing I've met maybe two. The community is small, but very helpful. When you're first \"born\" into the world, an announcement is sent out, and chances are someone will stop by to greet you. Don't be shocked, we all just want to share how great of a place Anyland is, and make sure you know how to play. If you have questions, ask--someone will answer. If they don't know the answer, well, we'll try to figure it out together. This isn't just a social community, this is a community of psuedo-gods creating a multi-verse together.\n\nAre you ready to build with us?\n", "timestamp_created": 1513930719, "timestamp_updated": 1513930719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38313972": {"recommendationid": "38313972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204707856", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3390, "last_played": 1516355605}, "language": "english", "review": "So far of all theVR games i have played this is by far the most fun.

If you stick with it! What is more you can animate the items with scripts. The thing that will keep you coming back to the game is the community though, they never cease to amaze me, but more about them further down. \nSo how complex can you get? Well here is a couple of examples, a player showed me a button on his wrist, when pressed glowing wings unfolded from his body, a body he fully made in anyland! Yesterday when playing around with my space (of which you can have a seemingly unlimited supply of should you wish it) some players popped in and showed me a lot of devices, from a gun that fires small needless that actually have an injection animation when they hit you and can then teleport you, to a gun that fired giant cheese puffs that start small and then slowly engulf you.\nYou can also put anything you see into your inventory, don't worry about your kleptomaniac impulses upsetting people, it makes a copy, the original item remains :) and you have 100 pages to utilise so you will not run out of space anytime soon, These items can then be placed in your own areas (and when you look at the description you can see how many times it is placed and its author, a great way to see how popular your item is) \nAnother very important thing to note, the developer clearly cares deeply for the game and his community, many updates and bug fixes, this is no money grabbing shovelware game.\n\n[b]ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENT[/b] \nThe roomscale is pretty perfect for this, once you get the hang of the commands you will be teleporting about and creating items left right and center, at no point did i feel restricted by the roomscale mechanics and you are even able to rotate your self via buttons should you need to, i have also played via the lazy method\u2026. Sitting on my sofa. Now the environments, ok heres where this one is a little hard to review, The environments are all made by the players, so my area since im a noob is very bland, blocked shapes, but then you get some areas that are just breathtaking, some people have spent some serious time and effort to make some truly wonderful areas. It is a game that is almost as much fun to simply explore as it is to create!\n\n[b]GRAPHICS[/b] \nMost things are basic shapes, but with these basic shapes you can build anything, you can also colour them, turn them to metal, to a video screen for youtube, to fluid, to glass. There are both area lights with real time lighting to spotlights that have full lighting and shadows, so again graphics are tricky to nail down\u2026.this is no witcher 3 but it is also better then minecraft if you put the time in to make your area awesome\u2026. Overall i would say that it is a great graphic style for this game.\n\n[b]PERFORMANCE[/b] \nNow mostly the game runs great, i have visited areas with thousands of objects and been unaffected, i have also had my fair share of crashes, a testament to the game though is that when i have crashed i have simply loaded up the game straight away. I have seen objects that will bug out players, and currently a door i made has glitched and has a nasty habit of following players around, i have had some fellow players threaten to make a \u201cDave\u2019s Door\u201d meme...gulp\u2026 but it is early access, a phrase that does make us groan i know and often used to cover a multitude of sins but here it is true, the developer can be seen to clearly be fixing bugs and adding content, in fact since i bought the game i do not think i have seen a single day without a patch (Philip the dev seems to be a one man machine and i truly wonder if he actually sleeps and eats or just codes non stop, there is a reason my fellow players love him so much that there is even a \u201cChurch of Philip\u201d (an institution i think i may be banned from for excessive punning)\nSo in short not the smoothest vr game i have ever played but by no means too buggy (and when it is running ok...which is the majority of time\u2026 it is perfectly fine)\n\n[b]INTUITIVENESS[/b] \nOk here for me is where it fails, my first experiences with the game had me so frustrated i rage quited (an absolute rarity for me) and almost refunded the game, however there is an amazing community in this game and they helped me on the forums and then helped me in game, within a few hours of getting help i was creating animated doors (not the Dave stalker door) with multiple sections and even made myself a head that has an animate mouth which opens and closes as i talk. And just yesterday i made a slot in my body open up like a tray and have a torch dropped into it that other players can use. \nSo let us say it is not intuitive to begin with and has a learning curve that can be got over fast with the help of its community.\n\n[b]MULTIPLAYER:[/b] \nOh man, this is where the game shines, the community in this game, as i have said multiple times now, are awesome. Never have i felt so welcomed in a game then in this one, from people stopping by and complementing my animations on my door and showing me little tips and tricks to impromptu parties\u2026. Yesterday i was working in my secret lab (that is open to the public) when a couple of players popped in, with in minutes we were laughing and seeing the cool things they found and made...a few minutes later more people turned up , we were all talking, laughing and before i knew it time had slipped away and it was 7am and i decided i needed to sleep,(i got woken up at 10am by a neighbour who demanded i keep it down in future\u2026.seems i was having so much fun laughing and chatting that i woke him up \u2026 oops, but it shows what i mean by how fun this community is.\n \n[b]PROS:[/b] \n[list]\n[*] Awesome community.\n[*] Very active dev.\n[*] Your avatar is made by you (or for you) and as such can be unique.\n[*] Your imagination really is the limit of what you can build.\n[*] A super simple yet really powerful scripting and animation system.\n[*] The community that is so good it really has to be said twice.\n[*] Exploring other peoples worlds is amazing, the details some put into them,  and the stuff they make is just awe inspiring. \n[/list]\n\n[b]CONS:[/b] \n[list]\n[*] Steep learning curve to start off with if you do not talk to others.\n[*] Some bugs can be a bit annoying.\n[*] Putting on your body (specially the torso) is very tricky to get right.\n[*] No undo button (though you can undo a deletion)\n[/list]\n\n[b]VERDICT[/b] \nIf you are not a complete solo only gamer and enjoyed lego this is a must have.\nIf you love minecraft for the creative side, then you need this game.\nYou will totally get your money's worth from this.\nAlso did i mention, the community is very good?\nYep it has my seal of approval (no actual seals were harmed in the making of this approval)", "timestamp_created": 1487302266, "timestamp_updated": 1487302478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584235", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29854794": {"recommendationid": "29854794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022527992", "num_games_owned": 684, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 15837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511506449}, "language": "english", "review": "Anyland is Amazing. \n\nThe only word to describe it you can be anyone or anything you choose and create anything you want in this world and the small but dedicated regular players will cast no judgment infact we'll welcome you open armed into our little community \n\nAnyland is a world I drop in on almost everyday I meet my friends in there rooms I chat help them come up with ideas and have lots of fun together. \n\nWhether that be taking a torch and pitchfork and surprising one or own in there world or just hanging out together chatting. \n\nAnyland is wonderful. \n\nI simply cannot recommend it highly enough.", "timestamp_created": 1486839371, "timestamp_updated": 1486839371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494759", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29788079": {"recommendationid": "29788079", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028954718", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486581560}, "language": "english", "review": "\n I am impressed!

Yet powerful, it can recognice simple and also surprising interactions (You can set functions to an object even for when users LOOK at an object or for when you literally just touch it.) Also, you can use scripting on your own avatar! and add animations (More than just lip sync) for when you talk, or you can add buttons to yourself. (I've seen a chicken flying a UFO that could fire sunny-side up eggs at you with a button on their wrist.)\n\nOne of the only things that I find very limiting is the lack of grouped objects.. Currently it can be difficult/time consuming to animate many objects on a single creation.. (My avi has ears made of many parts, I'd LOVE to animate them, and I could but I'd be required to move all parts precisely.. And I just get lazy.. x3)\n\nYou also have an inventory where you can copy/save many creations you find entertaining or useful, and it's also very simple and easy to use (Tablet on your back that holds tiny versions of the objects you've saved.)\n\nAnd currently there's a decent amount of creations to explore! I've seen a nightclub with a working DJ table,\nLarge forrests,  mazes, a working RPG with written dialog, a recreation of someone's living room in a tree house!\nAnd much (Admittedly not TOO much.) more that I've personally seen, but I need to explore more... \n\nAll in all, I HIGHLY recommend this game, I will admit that the user base isn't high.. And that's one of the reasons I'm writing this review, but even when not hanging out with anyone you can be busy on creations! And also there's usually atleast a few users to say \"Hello\" to.\n\nI want this game to rise to add more worth to existing creations and for many new ones to come!\nI overall highly recommend this game and hope to see new users soon.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1483540016, "timestamp_updated": 1483540016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28989325": {"recommendationid": "28989325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008935116", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485554325}, "language": "english", "review": "Just got Anyland a few days ago and love it.

This is fully collaborative sandbox building, sharing items with friends and getting incredible creations from places you explore and people you meet. The only criticism I have is the game is very buggy and nowhere near complete but bugs are getting reported and fixed and if anything it's incredible that I can talk directly to the developer when he hangs out in game and make suggestions or tell him what I'd like to see next. Oh I forgot to mention, you can export objects you create to OBJ format and 3D-print them or just view them in any CAD software.

I just finished my desk in the back, changed the walls into a nice metal/glass combo, made monitors and my computer, created a nice table with measurements built in- equal to reality.\nHow I map my room into VR:\nI stand there in the digital void, and feel an object in front of me with my physical hands- I then create a digital object to serve as a glowing pin suspended in the air and pin this to each corner of the physical object- in VR. Once I have the measurements, I quickly create a large rough polygon with my digital hands, resizing quickly to fill out the shape. I set the color and then decide if I want any additional functionality.\nFor most furniture items I set no further options, as I do not want other users entering my universe to start flipping the desk for fun.\nFor most other items, I set options to make the object \"holdable\". This will create a copy of the object in the user's hand 6 they attempt to \"grab\" the digital item.\nI can easily add an animation to an object-but think of this- when you animate an item in Virtual Reality, and are standing there amongst objects of your creation, the animated object feels very \"real\".\nThe process of animation is very easy-\nExample of animating the blink of an eyelid:\nSelect eyelid object\nOnce selected, a screen will appear, showing \"1\",\"2\"\nThese are the key frames in the action list\nBy default they are empty, but you can click on \"2\", move the item, click back on \"1\" and see the item jump back and forth/ only doing so when you click the buttons marked \"1\", and \"2\"\nBut if we wanted to make the thing animate on its own, we click on \"1\" and select the commands that pop up in this order:\nWhen starts then become next in 1s\nIt's easy.\nYou then click on 2, and under the command list, the bottom option will be the last used command- like a shortcut for your history.\nWhen starts then become next in 1s\nNext for the last position cycles back- so this animation will cycle between frame 1 and frame 2, every 1s- forever.\nNow imagine that instead of it just cycling, it waited for a command-\nAnyland allows for many triggers:\nWhen:\nTouched\nConsumed\nHeld\nThrown\nNearby\nTouched by\nEtc\nSo, if we wanted a shining red crystal floating in the air in front of us to activate a door that opens vertically upon a touch- the process is very easy and very awesome\nBest way to describe this is- \nReady player one\nOr your dreams come true.\nYou could sit there and recreate the entire movie of Jurassic park to become an interactive virtual reality experience if you just took the time. You could create full sized animated raptors, full sized animated t-Rex stepping on a full sized jeep, next to a full sized moat-cliff, near full sized giant trees, near full sized giant brachiosaurus that were animated eating leaves.\nUnderstand that this is not like a \"video game\"\nThis is virtual reality..\nAnd I really have been sleeping in VR.\nI pull up a nice documentary on my virtual television and slip on my virtual sleeping bag- animated to expand and contract with each breath.\nFunny thing is people still show up in my virtual room even when I'm sleeping. They stand over me and watch me. Some even put something relaxing on the television for me.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DeSJBN2nqaY\n\n\nLink to playlist of 3 videos by Gooboberti on Anyland:\nhttps://youtu.be/ssODNmA-wUY?list=PL1ejlqbXsHawWiHXgkbQ_XpuQz6aQb2Ay\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1480571762, "timestamp_updated": 1480571762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732603", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28032524": {"recommendationid": "28032524", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014862557", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508950221}, "language": "english", "review": "Silly game, needs more players", "timestamp_created": 1480407451, "timestamp_updated": 1480407451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503817", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27970191": {"recommendationid": "27970191", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989952569", "num_games_owned": 414, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 9739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496017920}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great!

With the friendly community, bouncing ideas off each other & helping solve design problems is fun.\nI was initially wary of Anyland because I read \"scripting\" and thought \"too complicated\" and that was a mistake to think this. Scripting is optional but it's simple auto-complete commands from lists + your own variables. So simple, yet still powerful. Watch Philipp's short tutorial vids with quick examples, then experiment.\nNow I see various VR games, like wave shooters or \"experiences\" like walking around in an artsy environment for example, and instantly think \"I can make that myself in an evening or 2 in Anyland.\" ;-)\n\n\nIn the Top 5 \"Must Have\" Vive programs for me!\nAnyland is exactly what I wanted for VR and has taken over most of my VR game time since I bought it.\nNot content just cons00ming experiences, I want to create & build *anything*. And now I can create even worlds.\n\nEverything is fairly intuitive to do, from creating to moving to manipulating & resizing shapes; it all feels natural. This is 3-D modelling the way I always wanted, not in a 3-D CAD program on a 2-D monitor with a 2-D mouse.\nThe UI in-game for everything is smartly designed for interaction with VR hands. The devs are thinking in VR, not thinking of traditional 2-D UI for monitors and forcing it into VR.\n\nBecause controls & interfaces are smartly designed and intuitive, modelling things can be done fast after a very short learning curve.\nThe low-poly and low-texture aesthetic of Anyland helps to make modelling fast and easy, and thus the system requirements aren't obscene. (I've looked at other world-building VR programs out now which are ambitious and high-poly and I nope out because they're overly complex to create in.)\n\nThere's a straight-forward scripting language with auto-complete options which is simple to learn & use. This takes the possibilities from static objects & scenery to near-limitless possibilities.\n\nThe dev is active on the Steam forums and listens to suggestions, sometimes implementing new features & script commands the next day!\n\nMeeting other people in VR and chatting is always a great experience. In Anyland where you create your own avatar from scratch, it's even more impressive than other social VR \"games\" because you can fully represent how you want to look, not restricted to things like humanoid or... anything at all.\n\nMy only complaint is a personal one: I want to create so many things, buildings, and worlds and I only have so much time in a night!\n\nFans of RPO: this is like a nascent OASIS.\n\n\nBottom-line:\nIf you have a Vive, and enjoy exploring worlds and/or creating things then get Anyland!", "timestamp_created": 1480109792, "timestamp_updated": 1485028502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27520485": {"recommendationid": "27520485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009801173", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511368777}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really fun, all it needs it more people playing but its still fun creating your own stuff", "timestamp_created": 1480099484, "timestamp_updated": 1480099484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503817", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27508251": {"recommendationid": "27508251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022679792", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513803708}, "language": "german", "review": "Super Spiel, einfach weiter zu empfehlen.

Those 5 hours consisted of about 2 arcade matches figuring out the controls and then hopping into story mode. I just picked the first character which was Sol Badguy. I then spent a little bit fighting 4 enemies and not really minding the challenge. This is where it all goes downhill. I have no idea who was in charge of creating the bosses, but they should be drug out into the street and shot. See, all bosses have gimicks. Once boss for instance just regenerates health, another boss' gimick is that he can take out 3/4ths of your health bar in 1 combo, can get even more powered up and also regenerates his health, meaing that his gimick is that he's a near unbeatable piece of shit. I've played a few fighting games in my day, but none have made me more frustrated than this. I wouldn't recommend this game to worst enemy, I'm pretty sure I could have beaten the entirety of the first Dark Souls game in the time it took me just to beat the last 2 enemies of Sol's \"story.\" I put that in quotes because it has the bare minimum of what a story should have.\n\nIn short, fuck this game. Go right on past it and never look back. Just pick up some other fighting that doesn't make you want to staple your nutsack to the ceiling.\n\nEdit: Came here to edit my review as I'd calmed down and then tried the game again. I looked in the options menu and saw that the game was set to normal difficulty, so I dropped it down to beginner and tried the same route again. Man, it was so much easier. The two bosses that gave me the most trouble, I-no and Order Sol were much more mangagable. My fighting game background isn't the best (came from Street Fighter 2, 4, Skullgirls, those kinds of games) and this apparently has a much higher skill ceiling. If you're like me and this is your first Guilty Gear game, don't be afraid to drop the difficulty down. It is fairly easy to learn a few combos that link together nice, but I don't think the game has a tutorial mode that I think would have been nice. I still have problems with the story though. Mostly because even after playing through it twice (Sol's story), I have no idea what is really going on. I guess it assumes so other knowledge on my part of a previous game, but the story is bonkers. I believe the online is mostly dead as well because most people probably moved to the new Guilty Gear game. In short, I know longer think it's a piece of shit, but there are other more beginner friendly games out there that I think would be easier to get into.", "timestamp_created": 1521294489,

The problem is the control scheme and keybinding. The game assumes you will have a pair playing on the same computer and doesn't give you the option to just not have that on by default. Player 1 can't force control bindings for some reason, instead you have to rebind everything in player 2's control scheme, which I cannot do because the button I need to assign keys with does not exist. The default controls thereof are awkward to use. Even using a controller, the game forces me to use the analog stick rather than the directional pad, which does not make the controls less awkward, particularly for dashing.\n\nWhile the issue is only borderline game-breaking in my case because I'm not playing on the appropriate OS, the arbitrarily awkward keybinding is still a major issue with the game that creates a rather negative experience for me.

The controls are wonky, but they cause your hands to be placed in a relatively inoffensive alignment unlike many 2d fighting games. The combos are just as good as the rest, and the character designs are just as ridiculous as the rest.\n\nIf it's your genre, you won't be disappointed. But do yourself a favor and google all of the controls before booting the game up. Even the menu has non-standard controls. Evidently pressing \"i\" is how you choose an option.

Das ganze 2D-Beat'm Up Genre wird von Capcom und SNK beherrscht. Das Ganze Genre? Nein. Denn in diesem Jahr trat auf Sonys Playstation mit der Guilty Gear Reihe ein weiterer Mitstreiter auf den Plan, mit dem sich der bis dato unbekannte Entwickler ARC System Works neben Street Fighter, King of Fighters und Co seinen Platz in dem Genre sicherte. W\u00e4hrend das tolle Ambiente zu seinem erscheinen als eine Mischung aus Samurai Warriors und Dalkstalkers beschrieben wurde (Video Games Oktober 1998), konnte auch das Gameplay vollends \u00fcberzeugen. Dazu kamen bildschirmf\u00fcllenden Special Moves, die bei einem derart fl\u00fcssigem Gameplay aufgrund des geringen Ramspeichers der Playstation derzeit eigentlich nur auf dem Sega Saturn als realisierbar galten. Und der Erfolg der Guilty Gear Reihe h\u00e4lt bis heute an: W\u00e4hrend sich Streetfighter in dieser Generation als totaler Reinfall herausstellte, und auch King of Fighters nicht mehr DER gro\u00dfe 2d-Pr\u00fcgler ist, der er noch um die Jahrtausendwende war, werden die Pr\u00fcgler von Arc System Works, zu denen neben Guilty Gear auch die BlazBlue-Reihe z\u00e4hlt, mehr denn je zu der besseren Alternative. Mit den vielen Modi bietet diese Reihe auch gerade f\u00fcr Einzelspieler mehr als die gro\u00dfen Konkurrenzspiele. Au\u00dferdem kann man Guilty Gear, ganz ohne Gamepad, im Versus Modus gegeneinander an einer Tastatur spielen.

There are so many that you wonder why their business model is about rehashing the same thing over and over again. One would assume that they would add 2-4 new heroes per release per annum. At that rate, over a 10-year period, you would have 20-40 new heroes. \n\nGuilty Gear Accent Core Plus gives you 25 characters to choose from with 2 repeats. \na. Sol Badguy and Order Sol \nb. Ky Kiske and Robo-Ky\n\nEven Guilty Gear Xrd REV 2 has only 26 characters. It's not exactly a lot. You would be expecting a buildup of even more characters. Hopefully, it will hit the 40 unique character mark.\n\nConclusion, this is an old game since there is an XrD series now. Try it when it's on sale.\n\n[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]\n1. Concept\nI like the concept. Simple and cool.\n\n2. Enhanced Modes\nI like characters being able to have a simple normal attack mode and a super-powered up mode. E.g. Sol Badguy and his ultimate.\n\n3. Simpler than Blazblue\nActions are not as complex so a larger audience can pick up the moves.\n\n4. Status Effects\nPoison: Zato-1's stage\nHeavy: Can't jump at all. Testament does this to Ky Kiske with earth binding magic. \n(Heavy could also be Mei's status effect ie. tying an Anchor to your leg). It would be better as a special skill.\nCursed : Can't Block at all. Sol Badguy stage\n\n[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]\n1. Artwork Lower Grade?\nCertain parts don't look that cool. One example is the scene where Sol Bad Guy stands over Justice.\n\n2. Keyboard Can't Work Well\nThe bare minimum is a D-pad. Best is joypad. The game is not designed to appeal to all systems. Unlike games like Warframe which seem to run on any platform. The combos are just to difficult to pull off.\n\n3. No Proper Notation\nSince this is a direct console port, there is no proper notation of what button corresponds to what. E.g. X, Y means Punch or Kick? Check the controller settings to get what I mean.\n\n4. The Design of Justice\nA bit lame. It's a dragon humanoid mecha with a tail but it's too bland. It needs to be slightly improved.\n\n5. Command List Explainations\nCould it all be changed to arrows? I know what the Z symbol means but it's not clear enough.\n\n6. A.B.A's Blood Pack\nIt's crucial to know how to transform. I had to guess which one was the transform action.\n\n7. Unicorn Head, Raven\nThe ugly shit.\n\n8. I-No final boss, Anji Mito\nI was expecting some super power. Nothing. Just a normal Anji Mito fight.\n\n9. Chip Zanuff's Kick Ultimate\nSo many hits, so little damage. Thematically, you are expecting something painful after getting hit by a blade after so many hits. I understand that it might be for game balance but it's quite lame.\n\n[h1][b]NEUTRAL[/b][/h1]\n1. Character Design\nI kind of like GG's characters a lot but you can see a very strong similarity to Darkstalker. Both in artistry and mechanics. E.g. Testament plays like Jedah from Darkstalker while the rest are like the following in the list. But of course, I liked Darkstalkers.\n\n\"Morrigan vs I-NO\nDemitri vs Sol Badguy\nDonovan vs Ky Kiske\nFelicia vs Jam\nLei-Lei vs Dizzy\nAnakaris vs Faust\nSasquatch vs Potemkin\nZabel vs Eddie\nBulleta vs Zappa\nJedah vs Testament\nDee vs Order Sol \"\n\n2. Never Getting the Action You Want\nSemi-circle back-forward is always confused with uppercut. It's mostly me but I feel that this is one problem of fighting games. The actions and combos just can't be done right by the majority of people.\n\n\n[h1][b]SUGGESTIONS[/b][/h1]\n1. RPG-Fighting Hybrid\nI think one super-impactful idea that I can think off the bat is a RFH. This is basically a Guilty Gear Characters side-scroller. It would be a co-op side-scroller. You can look at Guardian Heroes for what I mean. There is no leveling system, just player skill. However, the focus will be PvE. You will find different monsters, mobs and challenges. Finally, there will be a boss fight. You can choose to play good guy or bad guy. You will fight NPCs like the Holy Knights, Unique Gear Bosses, Big Giant bosses that will need high jumping to hit. Like Apocalyse and Onslaught in the Marvel vs Capcom series. You will get to explore the world of Guilty Gear. Enter shops to buy healing, pick up AI buddies, etc.\n\nThe idea is to appeal to a large audience. For those who like the skilled fighting, play PvP multiplayer or PvAI. For those less skilled players, play RPG style with friends in co-op mode. Actually, the more I type, the more I want Darkstalkers 4 to have it. GG lacks the expandability and continuation of Darkstalkers. I want to fight cool giant bosses with friends and pull out flashy ultimates. There maybe some issues like \"touch ultimates\" since they work on a normal sized model but not on a giant sized boss.\n\nThere's a lot of work to be done but I think a developer like ARC should have the resources to plan it out. There's Guilty Gear Judgement but I think you need a whole package deal. Basically, you have a RPG + Fighting Game all in one-set. Newbies play co-op vs AI RPG, pros play fighting PvP. Like Metal Slug levels, keep moving right.\n\n2. In-Game Tutorials of Combos / Tips\nI don't know what the combos for each hero are. All I see are the actions. It would probably be great to record a few short replays to show the different combos. E.g. 8-hit combo for Sol Bad Guy. I'm not talking about the L1 record button.\n\n3. Air Zone\nI think high-jumping into the air like Marvel vs Capcom opens up a whole new avenue of gameplay and powers for each hero. Currently, the zone is limited to a short rectangle. You can input high air dash, downward strikes/slam, climbing ladder combos, \n\n4. 3v3 Continuous Tag Teams\nThis is an old idea but I like the Marvel vs Capcom/KOF \"pick-3-heroes\"  combo. It opens up more replayability and removes the staleness of playing just 1 character over and over again. You also need to be able to swap heroes mid-battle, not the KOF style of having 1 hero die, move onto the next match and wait for the opposing hero to die. That's very time-wasting. In-game, that's called Team 3v3, very slow and few opportunities to combo.\n\n5. More Status Effects Moves\nFaust can Poison, Sol Badguy can Burn. Rather than all moves doing just damage, how about a lingering status effect for each Hero? E.g. \n\nWeaken : 0 Defence\nSlow : Move slowed and jump reduced\nPeace : Can't Attack at all\n\n6. Chun Li/E. Honda/Blanka Heroes\nWhere's the hero that gets to mash the same button over and over again? You need an easy hero for newbies.\n\n7. Destructible Levels\nHalfway through the match, the floor gives way and collapses and you get air battle. Or Match 1 ends, floor gives way to underground arena.\n\n8. Crowd Effects\nAll the background are kind of boring. If you win, the AI should cheer, get pissed off, fireworks should shoot up or an explosion should happen. If either side wins with an ultimate, a special effect should occur.\n\n9. Valentine instead of A.B.A\nWhile Valentine is from GG2 : Overture, her design is better than A.B.A's key. Also, no 3D space fights please. The 2D is pretty good already.\n\n10. Bad Ending, Good Ending, Hidden Ending\nYou know how many games have these 3 endings? It's time for GG to have that too for each hero. A bad ending if you choose the easy route, a good ending if you choose the hard route and a hidden ending if you choose the insane route.\n\n11. Super-Powered Up Version of each Hero\nLike I-No in the Arcade mode or Slayer when Faust fights him (this is a bad example as all he does is heal a lot). Every hero should have some crazy boss mode with skills that are not normally usable.\n\n12. Interesting Future Playable Characters\nCrow Kurasabe and Johnny's Master Uncho. You can always resurrect them with evil cloning technology.\n\n13. Robo-Ky and Order Sol\nInstead of the obvious reference to Sol and Ky, perhaps Robo-Ky can turn into a robot all on his own? Think of a name like Rob-O. Robo-Ky's horny nature seems to fit with the name, Rob-O. Story-wise, he just upgrades himself after the self-destruct sequence.", "timestamp_created": 1511701594, "timestamp_updated": 1514264678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

GG has always been about flashy combos, extremely diverse gameplay amongst characters and Heavy Metal aesthetics. Accent Core decided to take all that up to eleven and remains the craziest, most robust Guilty Gear there is.\n\nWhile many of the \"AC\" additions were actually introduced in GGXX Slash, AC decided to break the norms by essentially making everyone mini boss characters. Everyone can easily deal high damage, character moves have unique properties that assist their playstyle, new hit states (slide, bounce etc) and the new Force Breaks are there for when your character's gimick just isn't enough. For instance, Sol gets his big damage from Sidewinder loops, but if you can't bother with his Clean Hit mechanic, you can use FB Sidewinder for a guaranteed Clean Hit for only 25% Tension!\n\nThen there are the EX characters and old GG modes and if you thought GG wasn't crazy enough, boy have I got news for you... I really miss the EX characters in Xrd, they added so much more depth to the game, even if most of them were broken for one reason or another. Still, it was just really damn fun messing around with them. GG modes are a fun addition too, but I certainly didn't miss the GG1 style Instant Kills... \n\nFinally, the rest of the modes include a Story and a Mission mode with much less bullshit than their #R counterparts and a Survival Mode that's actually fun. Oh and M.O.M. if you like that, I guess. Extras include old mid 2000s fanart, some of which still looks great.\n\nAs a bonus, if you don't like +R's changes, you can always switch back to the old AC+ version.

(If this title interests you by the by, those older other tie in names to the series mentioned are definitely worth a recommendation too. They are just as good as this, only slightly older versions and a very tiny bit outdated in places)\n\nTo the pros of fighting games and this series, you might like this.. This is a definitely testing game for fast reflexes, combos and strategy on the fly, the only downside is unless you may have some biases with the art style in the game, which in contrast opinion, is possibly the strongest suit right next to the gameplay and controls.\nI can't speak much more in depth than what I know from tournaments and the tricks of being very good skill-wise in this game, as I am not really a hardened veteran / pro of this game, so for a more detailed opinion, this might not be it.\n\nFor casuals, it might be a bit hard to recommend as the game is fairly difficult, but that I don't think should be a bar to set for casual players, as it is not impossible to learn as you go, That's after all how a lot of us learned the basic jist of the game and got better at it, we just played it and even if we lost, we all kept trying harder and better the next time. :)\nThe most important way to decide if you want the game in my opinion, that depends on whether you really are convinced that this is a game you want to play and if you're confused by what that means, I'll use myself as the example of how I got into this game. Back when I used to play the other games a lot, I wasn't into fighing games, it actually was more the style and entire presentation of the game, the characters and all the other sweet things found here, such as tricky moves to pull off, Overdrive moves, etc., all those things in combination made me hyped enough to pick it up and play the hell out of it, just having fun however stupidly or good I was playing.

I can't imagine how good Xrd is if it is better than this game. Heavy Metal Rock was something I didn't like when I first encountered Guilty Gear music and although it was pure rock and I hated it at first, this is really the best video game music I can think of. As for the characters, each has a lot of story behind them that you have to play or research multiple games to fully understand.\n\nEvery character in this game is really cool and over-the-top. The game was basically balanced by making characters extremely powerful, but be thankful you didn't get a version where Eddie was able to destroy anyone if in the hands of a master player. Even bottom tier characters can take tournaments as people are known to play Sol and Ky despite them being rated near the bottom of tier lists.\n\nYou will be dealing with a very complex game in Guilty Gear. Special moves aren't super easy to do and you will have a lot to be remembering. But you can basically optimize how you handle any situation through skill because of things like Faultless Defense (take no damage and space away any attack), Full Roman Cancel (stop attacking mid-move to perform another move) and Gold Burst (gives a huge boost in tension if it hits or is blocked).\n\nAccent Core Plus R is not only the most balanced version of the game, but it also gives characters the most attacks they have ever had in the XX series.\n\nThe game is really fast paced and not really beginner/casual friendly, so I don't quite recommend you buy this game until you get adjusted to 2D fighters and how to learn them, but the game is very rewarding to play due to the fact that you can continuously improve your performance with the various mechanics and moves and large cast of characters.\n\nThis game is basically a must play, but I guess on the other hand, if you don't try this, at least try Xrd, which has much more advanced training for new players and a more flexible gameplay style.", "timestamp_created": 1501701277, "timestamp_updated": 1501701277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0,

It's the same game, it looks and feels like it, but it also feels as it has grown, in a positive way, you know?\n\nSo, let's go to the review, starting with the story. \n\n-Well, story wise, I'm still finishing story mode of most of the characters, but I'm kinda lost since I don't remember anything of previous games, so I've read about the story before this one, and it's pretty good and interesting. Kinda confusing at first glance, though, but still good.\n\n-Great art and character design, sprites in this game (the whole franchise, in fact) are amazing, and the stages (background places and all) are equally great, each having their own \"feeling\".\n\n-Characters are as great as design. They all really charismatic, each in their own ways, and if you like the game and play it for a couple of hours, you'll likely remember them all. They all have their own essence and personality, which is pretty well worked through story. Other good think I think about the characters is that you can kinda \"feel\" their personality only by fighting against or using them, which is something every fighting game should at least try to accomplish.\n\n-I don't know if I really have to say this, but this game has the best soundtrack I've EVER had the pleasure to hear in any fighting game, and I'm not sure if that's really true but it really feels that this franchise got famous mostly because of it's soundtrack. The voices of all characters are great, and is also one of the best dub I've heard in fighting games (Except when Jam starts screaming, that's kinda annoying since I always play this with the volume at max... But still great dub for her too)\nSOUNDTRACK IS PURE DIVINE COMPOSITION MADE BY THE GODS THEMSELVES. I just thought I should remember that part. \n\n-There are plenty to do in the game, with various modes options and unlockable, plus the achievements makes it even better, with some being REALLY hard to accomplish, so it's all a great challenge for those looking for it.\n\n-Which takes me to my next and final point, the gameplay. Now, Guilty Gear is not like other fighting games we know (except for those that followed his path), and it's kinda hard to explain but I can resume it in two words and one phrase: \"Frenetic\", \"combos\" and \"love for the character\". This last one my not make much sense if you're a stranger in the franchise, but you REALLY need to love the character you're playing. I mean, you don't have to worship them or love only them and don't give a shit about other characters in the game, but you NEED to love the character if you want to fully master him or them, For example, I love May, Jam, Ky, A.B.A and Chipp, those are my favorites and I my main/best characters, the ones I master (almost) completely, but that doesn't mean I can't play with Justice, Baiken or Millia (if that was the case I would never finish even story mode). And of course, there's some I simply can't make one combo right, like Potemkin, so I just stick to some tricks and finish his story, but would never pick him on versus mode.\nGot what I'm trying to say? That complement the character's session I was talking about earlier, each having their own gameplay, so if you get this game and doesn't like one or two, try a few more of them before saying the game sucks, maybe you can find your character(s).\n\nAlso, if you play or played BlazBlue, Dead or Alive, Tekken, Street Fighter, The King of Fighters or whatsoever, be warned that your knowledge of those fighting games may not be too useful. I tried playing BlazBlue thinking the the opposite side and what happened was \"ah, I play Guilty Gear and I'm pretty good at it, so this might be okooooooh shit this is different. Why are things so sloooooooow!!! WHERE IS MY COMBOS? WHY I CAN'T MAKE A COMBOOOO?! SOMEONE HELP ME PLS\", so be careful.\n\nAnd btw, the game is difficult as heaven (or hell), so if you like challenges, go for it. Sometimes it's so hard it gets you pissed, I actually lost count of my rage quits in this game, but it's probably between 20~50. (Really, I feel like a no-life waste in society for playing this in maniac/very hard, and also kinda masochist)\n\n-So after all...\nGuilty Gear is a REALLY frenetic fighter where the most important things are combos, knowing your character and understanding the gameplay in general, so you probably won't get anywhere smashing random buttons all the time and hoping something good happens, you really need to practice and work your way to get better in this wondeful (and pretty much forgotten on the mainstream fighting game scene) franchise. \n\nI'll give it a 10/10 without regret, but I know and understand that it might have some problems (not having a rage quit counter being one of them), though I don't really think things like \"too difficult\" can be considered a problem (right, IGN-san? c:), and I think that even with said problems, it doesn't impact on the score for me. And yes, I consider this to be the best fighting game ever made. \n\nAh and btw the soundtrack is really good.\nI'm serious, it's pretty good, trust me.\nYou should try listening to it a bit later.\nFor real.", "timestamp_created": 1499328083, "timestamp_updated": 1499328106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607649", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33263416": {"recommendationid": "33263416", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055346228", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493535863}, "language": "english", "review": "wait what game is this", "timestamp_created": 1499237648, "timestamp_updated": 1499237648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.426762", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33260602": {"recommendationid": "33260602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061045092", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501391756}, "language": "english", "review": "I used to play this when I was young, really good game.", "timestamp_created": 1499230518, "timestamp_updated": 1499230518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33218969": {"recommendationid": "33218969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041601161", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 2252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515125222}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a port of the console release of Accent Core.\nThe game is automatically set to +R which is nice.\nThe menu is set up terribly.\nbuncha other stuff I don't care enough to talk about.\nIt's Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R, it's the 8th version or something of the game released in a decade, everyone else has already moved on to Xrd, and nobody stuck around for the PC release because the netcode is balls.\n\nIf you know people to play with in person or if your internet's good enough, great.

Even though I'm complete garbage at fighting games in general, I found myself playing this game and being driven to enhance my skill, despite it being an old game.  The roster is quite large, with varying playstyles across the board, save for two characters that are semi-clones of the two main characters, but even then, they play drastically different from their original counterparts.  There are a handful of characters that can be picked up easily and can help develop skills and fundamentals for the characters that are more difficult to learn.  However, the game's difficulty in some of it's modes can be troublesome for new players, so if you're a completionist, remember to set it to a lower level lmao.  As for local play, I personally enjoy the Team Vs. Mode, it definitely has that King Of Fighters feel to it, playing out like a crew battle, where the winning character moves on to fight the next with some of their health restored if they took any damage, and there's always the classic One-on-One Vs. Mode.  The mechanics can be quite a task to understand for newer players too, but compared to the three different Roman Cancels in Xrd to the two in ACR, for newer players, even the one less tech to know definitely means an easier learning experience.  The speed at which the game plays is intense, and it's probably the only GG title in my library that I can run, since the only other GG game I own is Xrd, and my laptop isn't the best.  However, netplay can be tempermental at times, sometimes when I try to invite someone, or even the other way around, the guest of the room will randomly be kicked, so this might be a game that you'll most definitely want to play local multiplayer with.  Even with the netplay issues, most of the time it's not an issue, since most people don't go online.  But if you have a less than stellar setup, can find yourself a friend with a Steam-supported controller, or even an arcade stick, this game will kill time for you like no one's business.",

THEY'RE HERE, FUCKER! THEY'RE ALL HERE [strike]except Ultimax[/strike]!\" over it. [b]I rate it: 3 daredevils / 3 ***[/b][/i]\n\nIt took a while, but slowly Arc Sys has been putting their repetoire of fighting games on Steam and it somewhat seems like each port takes notes from the last. Take that unofficial netplay patch for #Reload, make it legit and not as difficult to deal with, add a character from the black sheep of the series [spoiler](Isuka, not Overture)[/spoiler], do about two renditions worth of balancing and gameplay tweaks, add an extra mechanic or two, and that's ^Core+R for you.\n\nAs for netplay, nobody seems to play much anymore, so you'd have to hit up the online fight games community to find matches. That's not so bad, since that'd make it a bit easier to find matches with someone close to you for a hopefully better connection. RIP Ranked Mode though I guess.\n\nThe training mode has more in-depth options like setting certain character's moves to certain properties (i.e. allowing infinite coins for Johnny, setting the charge to Jam's kick specials, etc.), which is more than any other fighting game that I have [strike]I think anyway[/strike], making it simpler to experiment. The only thing it's really missing compared to fighting games released nowadays is the option to change input lag to simulate online, a trial mode to teach you some bread n butter and fancy nancy combos, and that color editor that was only in the Guilty Gear that nobody wants to play.\n\nThe single player modes are more or less the same from the previous iterations. There's a new story for all the characters. M.O.M. Mode adds Order Sol as the hidden boss (and also arcade mode), and the Survival mode added some sweet new stat mechanic that allows you to have better stats and some special buffs like a Glass Cannon sort of skill or adding elemental damage after you beat !BLACK! versions of characters (HERE COMES DAREDEVIL). It's pretty fun, son.\n\nNot really much else to say, [spoiler]except when's Ultimax, but there's probably some form of licensing hurdle abound, so probably never.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]~ Catch you later,\nMike Van Halen[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1482439064, "timestamp_updated": 1482611041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475645", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28466370": {"recommendationid": "28466370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092017028", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492090682}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438. \u0412\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c)", "timestamp_created": 1482149833, "timestamp_updated": 1482149833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543726", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28388699": {"recommendationid": "28388699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219682963", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1521078768}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Guilty Gear XX AC PLUS R \u00e9 um jogo que usa e abusa de combina\u00e7\u00f5es e t\u00e9cnicas, enriquecendo a mec\u00e2nica do jogo.

However, this does [b]not[/b] mean that the game is unapproachable to all but those able to become masters. Rather, what this means is that the game has plenty of room allowing players to grow and really develop unique play styles in general as well as character-specific. ACPR is at the pinnacle of the previous generation of games where lots of attention to detail and bombardment of information takes precedence over accessibility and simplicity.\n\nACPR was never really intended to attract new people to the game. It is merely the culmination of previous iterations of Guilty Gear XX with more content added, gameplay tweaks, and balance changes. As such, it wasn't considered a \"new\" entry in the Guilty Gear franchise. The long road to ACPR is:\n\nXX -> XX #Reload -> XX Slash -> XX AC -> XX ACP -> XX ACPR.\n\nThe iterations span generations of consoles going all the way back to 2002 and the PlayStation 2 and Xbox era right up to 2012 and the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.\n\nPeople who desire lots of options and freedom in a fighting game will do well to pick up ACPR. However, those who want a more streamlined entry into the series and a thriving community should instead consider starting with the latest iteration in the Xrd sub-series available on Steam (currently Xrd -REVELATOR-). Those preferring the latter approach will likely not notice any technical differences between the two games until much later.\n\n[h1]PART II: EXISTING GUILTY GEAR PLAYER[/h1]\n\nIf you are familiar with Guilty Gear titles only [i]prior[/i] to ACPR, then it suffices to say that ACPR is simply the culmination of previous iterations having more added content, gameplay tweaks, and balance changes. It faithfully preserves what is expected of a 'Guilty Gear' title.\n\nACPR is the pinnacle of technical difficulty in the Guilty Gear franchise. The latest Xrd sub-series, which come after ACPR, serve to make 'Guilty Gear' more accessible to a wider audience with the specific effort to attract new players while at the same time retaining the previous player base. What this means is not necessarily a \u201cdumbing down\u201d of ACPR, but rather to allow players to become proficient at the game at a faster rate. Ultimately, though, Xrd does have a lower technical ceiling than ACPR. Nonetheless, Xrd is still a game that requires a high degree of proficiency to master - it\u2019s just not as high as ACPR. People who have plateued in Xrd and want to take their Guilty Gear game to the next level for personal satisfaction will thrive in ACPR.\n\nThe creator of Guilty Gear, Daisuke Ishiwatari, gave an excellent interview explaining the design choices of Xrd and how they differ from ACPR in order to make the game \u201cmilder\u201d:\n\nhttp://www.eventhubs.com/news/2014/jun/11/guilty-gear-xrd-milder-version-past-entries-creator-daisuke-ishiwatari-reveals-thinking-behind-xrds-design-decisions/\n\nXrd:\n- Less emphasis on individual pride in being able to pull off highly technical combos;\n- Now accepts buffered inputs in a number of situations; and\n- Reworking of Roman Cancel (can cancel most attacks on whiff and can visually confirm more easily when comboing).\n\nAdditionally, not mentioned in the above article, is the removal from ACPR of Force Roman Cancels, Slashbacks, and Force Breaks. You can find more information on these mechanics from the following pages:\n\n[b]Force Roman Cancels[/b]\nhttp://www.dustloop.com/wiki/index.php/GGACR/Movement#Cancels\n\n[b]Slashbacks[/b]\nhttp://www.dustloop.com/wiki/index.php/GGACR/Defense#Slashback_.28SB.29\n\n[b]Force Breaks[/b]\nhttp://www.dustloop.com/wiki/index.php/GGACR/Controls#Force_Breaks_.28FB.29\n\nAn exhaustive explanation of ACPR can be found on Dustloop:\n\nhttp://www.dustloop.com/wiki/index.php/Guilty_Gear:_Accent_Core_%2B_R\n\n*****\nPersonally, ACPR is my favourite entry in the Guilty Gear series. For me it\u2019s not so much the technical prowess it requires (I\u2019m actually very terrible at the game and nowhere near what would be considered \u201cproficient\u201d), but rather the freedom it gives me to accentuate my own play style.", "timestamp_created": 1469143912, "timestamp_updated": 1493521021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24431157": {"recommendationid": "24431157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207713425", "num_games_owned": 405, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519843257}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042f \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0437\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0433\u0438\u043b\u0442\u044b(\u0434\u0430-\u0434\u0430, \u043e\u043d \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 Xrd \u0438 \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u041e\u0440\u0434\u0435\u0440 \u0421\u043e\u043b).\n \u0428\u0438\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u044b\u0431\u043e\u0440 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439, \u0442\u0438\u043f\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0430\u0437\u0438\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0444\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433\u043e\u0432 \u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430(\u043e\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0437\u044f\u0442 \u043f\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0446\u044b), \u044f\u0440\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f\u0441\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0440\u0430\u0439\u0432\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043a, \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430(\u043f\u043e\u0434\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0438\u043b \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u0430\u0434 \u043e\u0442 \u043f\u04413 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 better ds3 -

You can't go wrong buying this.\n\nPros:\nThe graphics are the same as you remember them, but don't scale well at higher resolutions.\nBest soundtrack in the series.\nIt's Guilty Gear at its finest.\nThe netcode is decent.\n\nCons:\nAudio quality seems tinny compared to the console version.

I had no idea this game would come to PC and when it did I snatched it right away!\n\nPlease bear in mind this is NOT FOR BEGINNERS, especially folk new to fighting games as a whole! I am not at all new to fighting games and I very much struggle with this game, later versions of Guilty Gear made it what some consider the hardest 2D fighting game. While some may not agree that it is THE hardest no one can deny that it is one of the hardest and honestly it is the main problem I have with Guilty Gear. It's difficulty is almost needless.\n\nUnfortunately I still have to recommend it? Why? Because as a series it is one of the best and more interestingly designed fighting games you will fine. Ishiwatari Daisuke is a brilliant game designer and composer and one of the best in the industry. There is one thing even the most casual of players can enjoy about Guilty Gear as a series and that would be it's legendary badass soundtrack.

The updates each do worse commercially than the last, because refined things aren't as sexy as brand new things. It's hard to sell people on a better version of a thing they already have. So eventually, the carefully polished game is pushed aside for a brand new one, full of imperfections but fresh visuals and ideas.\n\nThose final versions of those games, however, tend to remain loved by a cult following. After all, they're the result of years and years of player feedback. Sometimes close to a decade of it. Fighting games like Super Turbo, 3rd Strike, The King of Fighters '98. They're all final love letters to their most loyal fans before their respective series ventured off into brave new directions.\n\nAccent Core Plus R is that love letter for fans of Guilty Gear XX, and it's written so well that it's hard for newcomers not to swoon over it, too. It's a game literally ten years in the making. With the exception of newcomers Kliff and Justice (who had previously been included as bonus console characters with no consideration for balance), the characters as they're represented in Plus R are based on years and years of player feedback. When Xrd was released later, it turned back the clock on its returning characters in an attempt to simplify them and not overwhelm players. As Xrd continues to see updates, that'll change. But for now, most of the Guilty Gear characters' Plus R iterations are the most interesting and fun they've ever been.\n\nThat said, there are definitely problems with this package. Getting the game to run without heavy input delay requires some fiddling with settings, both in-game and via NVIDIA Inspector (though you could get away with only adjusting the in-game settings). Additionally, the netcode is bad, and makes playing online both a chore and, often, a much, much less pleasant experience than playing someone offline. Lobbies are limited to two players at a time, and there are no replays, either. Meaning there's no way to watch others play, and potentially learn from them.\n\nStill, though. Plus R is the most fun fighting game I've ever played, and is fun enough for me to happily put up with those shortcomings. The game's an absolute joy, and if you've got people to play it with locally, then you absolutely have to at least try it. If all you've got is online play, I'd still encourage you to give it a chance!

This game was a fantastic fighting game for its time. It outclassed Street Fighter IV, Mortal Kombat vs. DC, and was on par with the likes of BlazBlue and KoF 13.\n\nHowever, unfortunately, the game of 26 characters and hard-to-master, yet competitive and fun gameplay, is now outdated somewhat, as Guilty Gear Xrd SIGN has come to the market for a reasonable price of $33 CAD. But, if you can't afford that game, are a GG collector, or if you want the pure nostalgia this game brings, it's for you. Also, it's a better purchase at just $17 CAD.\n\n+PROS+\n+Great storyline, it's very unique to its competitors and has a multiple choice outcome\n+The sprites are fantastic, and look like they've jumped out of an anime, at a good framerate and 720p graphics, they're great to go along with the menus, stages, and life bars\n+Netcode is great, if you can find somebody to play with\n+Unique roster of characters, such as Sol (typical fighting game asshole, has a sword to make him cooler), Ky (police officer, except French, not stereotypical, and has a sword), Jam (a girl who works a restaraunt joint, has a build you'd cream your pants over), Chipp (American, but he's a wannae Japanese ninja, still cool), and Bridget (crossdressing nun kid who can kick your pedophilic ass with his yo-yos)\n\n-CONS-\n-The game is outdated with the release of Xrd\n-A nonexistent amount of people play this game online nowadays\n-Using sprites, some people say that the game is 'outclassed' for its time; I don't neccesarily agree with this since it's the way the devs wanted it to be\n-Too many storylines to complete, they also overlap and it starts to get boring\n-Gameplay is extremely difficult to master, if you play online with noob status, you'll most likely get sent to hell and back\n\nIn the long run, if this were earlier in 2015, I'd give it a 94/100, but since it's getting older, I'm gonna give this, albeit fantastic game, an 86/100.", "timestamp_created": 1450788546, "timestamp_updated": 1450788654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19763579": {"recommendationid": "19763579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166466257", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479583436}, "language": "english", "review": "Dont get me wrong this is a great game but this is one of those games you will want to get a controller on other then that its a great game.", "timestamp_created": 1450451078, "timestamp_updated": 1450451078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19675947": {"recommendationid": "19675947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048258820", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463958806}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Recomendadissimo!", "timestamp_created": 1450018088, "timestamp_updated": 1450018088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531835", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19584368": {"recommendationid": "19584368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258418363", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479049774}, "language": "french", "review": "Les INFINIT\u00c9S DE COMBINAISONS DE COMBOS, du style, de la musique,  le fait qu'une centaine de joueurs peut jouer de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente un seul personnage, QUE VOULOIR DE PLUS !

Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R (melhor chamar logo s\u00f3 de Guilty Gear) \u00e9 o jogo da s\u00e9rie Guilty Gear que possui o maior n\u00famero de personagens, \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m o mais equilibrado, possui uma excelente trilha sonora e tem diversos modos para diferenciar um pouco, sendo eles o cl\u00e1ssico modo Arcade, um Story Mode para cada personagem do jogo, modo M.O.M, Mission, Survival e os demais que j\u00e1 s\u00e3o esperados como Training e \u00e9 claro, Versus mode e Online, al\u00e9m de um Team Battle onde cada jogador (ou a CPU) escolhem 3 personagens para lutar (um em cada round).\n\nA mec\u00e2nica do jogo \u00e9 bem complexa, cada personagem possui diversos golpes e combos que podem serem feitos, al\u00e9m de golpes especiais que por sua maioria s\u00e3o feitos com o cl\u00e1ssico \"meia lua\" e Overdrivers que s\u00e3o golpes especiais que utilizam barra Tension, em outras palavras \u00e9 a barra de especial do jogo, que tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 utilizada para usar outras mec\u00e2nicas como Psych Burst (um movimento especial um pouco mais forte que um especial normal, e um pouco mais fraco que um Overdrive), Cancel (cancela um ataque/combo e instantaneamente voc\u00ea pode voltar a come\u00e7ar outro ataque ou combo) e \"Faultless Defense\" (defesa absoluta onde o personagem n\u00e3o sofre dano algum). Para aprender todos as mec\u00e2nicas do jogo requer que o jogador treine um pouco, com o tempo voc\u00ea ir\u00e1 se acostumar se tiver se esfor\u00e7ado o suficiente. Guilty Gear \u00e9 um jogo que utiliza 5 bot\u00f5es, sendo eles K (kick), P (punch), S (slash), HS (high slash) e D (dust). Al\u00e9m de tudo j\u00e1 mencionado antes, o jogo tamb\u00e9m possui o Instant Kill para cada personagem, por\u00e9m n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito f\u00e1cil de acertar o oponente e caso voc\u00ea use e erre, ficar\u00e1 sem a barra Tension at\u00e9 o final do round.\nQuanto aos personagens, s\u00e3o 25 ao total, cada um com um estilo diferente e ataques pr\u00f3prios. Os gr\u00e1ficos s\u00e3o todos em 2D e muito bem feitos, n\u00e3o tanto quanto os de BlazBlue (jogo criado pela mesma empresa e tamb\u00e9m mais moderno) mas ainda assim tem seu pr\u00f3prio charme.\n\nSe voc\u00ea gosta bastante de jogos de luta, recomendo muito a s\u00e9rie Guilty Gear. Se voc\u00ea \u00e9 novato na s\u00e9rie poder\u00e1 ter algumas dificuldades no inicio, mas \u00e9 s\u00f3 treinar que com o tempo consegue pegar o jeito, para isso h\u00e1 o modo Training, dentro do jogo tamb\u00e9m tem uma op\u00e7\u00e3o \"help\" onde explica um pouco sobre cada mec\u00e2nica da luta. Agora se voc\u00ea \u00e9 novato em jogos de luta em geral, eu n\u00e3o recomendaria come\u00e7ar por este jogo, n\u00e3o \u00e9 algo impossivel, mas \u00e9 que Guilty Gear n\u00e3o \u00e9 um jogo muito \"f\u00e1cil\". Esteja bastante familiarizado com jogos de combate 2D que utilizam \"meia lua\" e demais mec\u00e2nicas para golpes especiais e semelhantes, Guilty Gear \u00e9 um jogo bastante r\u00e1pido e requer... velocidade em seus movimentos.", "timestamp_created": 1448245343, "timestamp_updated": 1448245343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.767798", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19219675": {"recommendationid": "19219675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080734877", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483730667}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0444\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433 \u0441 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043c, \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043e\u043c. \u0414\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u0418\u0418 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e. \u041a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0430. \u041e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e. \u041a\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c \u0444\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433\u043e\u0432 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430\u043c \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0435.", "timestamp_created": 1448214509, "timestamp_updated": 1448214556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592626", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19121779": {"recommendationid": "19121779", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015453793", "num_games_owned": 937, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449773381}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Embora eu preferiria ter a vers\u00e3o mais recente Xrd sendo lan\u00e7ada para computador, GGXXAC+R \u00e9 a \u00faltima revis\u00e3o da s\u00e9rie XX e \u00e9 um jogo de luta bem t\u00e9cnico, complexo, com variedade de personagens e profundidade", "timestamp_created": 1447718326, "timestamp_updated": 1447718326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567972", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19090139": {"recommendationid": "19090139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166885149", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2063, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509079447}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5728\u7ebf\u4eba\u6570\u7565\u5c11\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709RELAY\u529f\u80fd\u5c0f\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u8fde\u673a\u8fd8\u662f\u6068\u6d41\u7545\u7684\u3002\u76f8\u6bd43D\u65b0\u4f5c\u66f4\u96be\u4e0a\u624b\uff0c\u753b\u9762\u4e5f\u6bd4\u4e0d\u4e0a\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u6570\u91cf\u5b8c\u80dc\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89d2\u8272\u8fd8\u6709EX\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u534a\u4e2a\u65b0\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1447580243, "timestamp_updated": 1480651368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19013236": {"recommendationid": "19013236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079442594", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2983, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463254381}, "language": "english", "review": "GGXX^Core +R delivers that classic feel with more refurbished mechanics.

It's important that some of the fighting game and arcsys fans on steam purchase this one and Blazblue continuum shift so Arcsys realizes that if they release their games at or near the same time as on consoles they can still get a good amount of sales on PC, it works for Street fighter so why not Arcsys? \n\nEither way, even if you're looking for online Core +R is still not the most optimal choice, in it's first few weeks of release on steam it the ranked and player match queue were full of people but the hype died soon after and you'll be able to get matches after waiting for long periods of time.

I like this more than Bloody Roar 3, Street Fighter IV, BlazBlue, Sk\u00fcllgirls, and anything else that comes to mind. All the characters are lovable, the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic, the gameplay is absolutely perfectly balanced between casual and competitive, and is just outright fun to play. It's just fun. The characters are entertaining and look good, the animations are good, and the voices are good too. They're all extremely unique, too, and as soon as I started the game up for the first time I immediately connected to them, unlike, say, Street Fighter. I have way more hours in Street Fighter, and yet I can't say I care for 90% of the characters. Ryu's okay, Sakura's cool, and I kind of like Guile, and some others... but when I opened up Guilty Gear, and went straight to the versus mode, I just looked at everyone, and said, wow, these are some awesome characters.\n\nI pretty much picked May once, and then immediately decided she would be my main from then on. But I still can't help but like everyone else, still, they're all just really, really cool, and all feel like they have their own stories and personalities, all of which I can kind of get just by playing as them. And then there's all their story modes, which I haven't even got around to yet...\n\nSome of my other favourite characters are Johnny, Baiken, Bridget, Sol, Ky, I-No... and then, honourable mentions to Faust and Dizzy. And then everyone else. But I guess I can say those first five are my secondary favourites, though I just kind of like Faust's hilariously weird theme, and then I just find Dizzy cute, and oddly interesting as a character. And everyone else is cool too. Just, I don't care for them quite as much obviously.\n\n...

Both their other franchise BlazBlue as well as Guilty Gear have much to offer. Characters are extremely well designed, with each one boasting their own select set of skills and moves. The best part of Guilty Gear, and the feature that sets it well apart from other fighting games, is the balance of the fighters. Nearly every game I play with friends ends up with one of us on a pixel left of health by the end of the match. This makes the fights feel EXTREMELY intense, and any game that can actually get my heart going is a game I'm interested in. Button mashing isn't enough, and you'll come to learn all sorts of new techniques and mechanics as you play. \n\nHIGHLY recommended for ANY fan of fighting games.", "timestamp_created": 1436870141, "timestamp_updated": 1436870141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17034126": {"recommendationid": "17034126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025215720", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516775075}, "language": "english", "review": "Literally the best fighting game of all time.\nDandy step, pilebunker and crosswise heel your way to victory as you\nfight opponents in Arcsys Games finest product.\n\nNetcode is shit though, someone make a caster.", "timestamp_created": 1436823472, "timestamp_updated": 1436823472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631282", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16982597": {"recommendationid": "16982597", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998135402", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 7845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509282043}, "language": "english", "review": "Guilty Gear XX ACCENT CORE PLUS R is the latest and possibly last Revision for this nearly 15 year old Game\nIt is by far the most balanced Fighting Game ever with huge in-depth Mechanics and Modes. Since the Mechanics to explain can fill entire Pages, i recommend visiting the Dustloop Wiki for more Infos.\n\nBesides the Mechanics, also the Characters and the Music (made both by Daisuke Ishiwatari) contributed to the huge success of this Series. It is easy to say that it belongs to the Top 3 of Fighting Games (Tekken, SF and GG)\n\nAccent Core as a Revision was also completely redone with new Looks (GUI, Menus, Character Portraits, etc.) and also the Voicing of all Characters are remade. Since Core Plus there is also a new Story Mode (2 Paths for each Char except Justice, Kliff and Holy Order Sol) and the R Revision received a brand new GUI which replaced that of Accent Core.\n\nAs a Side Note, BlazBlue is also made by ARCsys (Only Music made by Daisuke) and shares some Mechanics but hasn't the same Depth.\n\nIt offers many Modes such as a Story Mode, Missions, Survival, etc.\nThe Story Mode is recommended to grasp the Personalities of the Characters and to see which suits you the best.\n\nHere are some of my Pro/Contra Points:\n\nPro:\n-Good PC Port from the Consoles\n-Variety of many Characters\n-Awesome Rock/Metal Music\n-Voiced Story Mode\n-All Stages from Slash/#Reload Revision are included (must be unlocked through Story Mode)\n-Good Game Mechanics\n-Network Mode! (#R has only Fanmade Network Mode)\n-Latest Revision with new Moves and Balancing for all Characters\n\nContra:\n-Slightly higher Frame Delay than the #R PC Version (5F while #R has 2F set)\n-Slash/#Reload Stages can only be used Offline and not in Network Mode\n-Announcer and some Voices of the Characters (for Example: Baiken has now the Voice of an old Grandma, etc.) are poorly redone. They were better in the Old pre Accent Core Revisions.\n-Network Mode is suboptimal at Times (It uses Frame Delay Input and not GGPO which is faster but has also its own Flaws)\n-Steep Learning Curve while progressing\n-Not much Players online depending on Times. Check the \"Find Player\" Thread in the GGAC+R Steam Forum for Players in your Region\n\nThat's all.

Here is a proof:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/348550/discussions/0/617336568071954048/\n\nAnd I ve been playing Guilty Gear since GGxxReload \u2013 now it\u2019s almost 10 years\u2026so trust no one but me ^_^ \u2013 100% honest review!\n~~~~~~~~~~\nNow the review.\n\n[b]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe overall score is 9.5 from 10.                                 ~\nI would not rate this high ANY other fighting game.    ~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/b]\n\nProS!:\n\n+Stunning port from the consoles. Even better than the original console version! I know it\u2019s hard to believe guys but\u2026I could not find any single lag input\u2026frame drop (system recommendations are too high \u2013 the game itself will work perfect on much weaker pc. \n\n+Improved imput method for the keyboard players. You will be surprised how smooth the imputs for the special moves are.\n\n+ALL console bugs were fixed! They even added arcade borders portraits when I did ask them.\nI could not wish for more. My legacy for the Guilty gear series has been completed.\n\n+Amazing artwork\u2026surprising satisfaction - cos the \u201cstyle\u201d is so well kept and evolved. The ac core style combine with some xxreload(previous series etc.) \u2013 and boom shakalaka.\n\n+Great memorable soundtrack that just fits the game PERFECT. I personally never-ever wanted to shut down the music in the game. Another thing that comes to surprise.Some tracks are like well\u2026street fighter ken stage for example \u2013 are immortal.\n\n+The gameplay is hard to master but not by the ugly controls. It\u2019s all about the skill. The more and better you become \u2013 the more you want to play. Again\u2026I remember this kind thing only at the Primal Rage arcade (when I was a kid) and Ultimate Mortal Kombat from sega mega drive\u2026sweet childhood. ^_^\n\n+Almost perfectly balanced game. This actually comes to surprise when you see that almost in every tournament with +R almost always played with different chars at the grand finals. I would dare even to say that there are NO CHARS in this game that s@ck a@@!\n\n+Almost perfect netplay! You can find and play come really good matches!\n\n+If you love an Anime \u2013 you are gonna love this game even more.\n\n+If you don\u2019t love an Anime \u2013 this game will make you love it and you will want to watch it ^_^\n\n+TONS of offline modes. You will N-E-V-E-R get bored in this game. And there are none which I can call lame\u2026delete this plz etc\u2026surprisingly amazing job done.\n\n+25 chars roster. Anybody will be satisfied and pick the char they will like and love to play. Again I could not find any bad or any \u201cout of place\u201d chars.(Xrd for example Bedman\u2026Jack\u2019o \u2013 looks like Blazblue rejected chars)\n[b]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n++Better than Guilty Gear Xrd!\u2122~\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[/b]\nNow the cons:\n~~~~~~~~~~\n-(-0.25) While I said \u2013\u201calmost perfectly balanced\u201d \u2013 some chars got some nerf since the last version of ggac core(Testament for example my char). While I do welcome the balancing \u2013 some moves are nerfed beyond common sense. The \u201cstartups of the special moves\u201d are too slow\u2026same goes to some other chars\u2026and reverse boosting some other chars: Zappas for example knife summon got huge buff and looks overpowered sometimes\u2026 Chipp Zanuff looks ridiculously fast. Baiken\u2019s counter hits could be a real nightmare. Millia Rage if played well is almost unstoppable\u2026same goes to Dizzy\u2026yep >.<  I ve played a LOT vs pros using this chars\u2026and if they are mastered\u2026the game is starting to look as \u201calmost\u201d balanced..\n\n-(-0.25). The netcode is good. The netplay is good but a little clumsy. We all do need a lobby via XXreload style.  The delay is good but tricky sometimes\u2026sometimes I do host and when we play I have a little delay\u2026sometimes I don\u2019t have any(!) delay( I have 75mbit internet).\nAlso looking for a ggpo online infected. Or some custom network patch like it was in ggxxreload online that was made from a scratch by a Japanese guys(yes this game has it\u2019s own cult)\nJust so I could rate this game almost 10/10!\n~~\nOverall don\u2019t be scared about my last statements\u2026the online mode is still good! Very \u2013 very playable and enjoyable. I just wish that it was perfect as the rest of the game.\nAnd the balance is solid\u2026just some really stupid decisions about some minor moves.\n~~\n\nWell \u2013 did you read all of this? Thanks if yes.\nIf not just buy this AMAZING game and read the review!\nStunning fighting game that no one even come close! \nLet\u2019s ROCK!\n\nALF\u2122.\n\nP.S.\nYeah & add me to the steam friends if  you wanna play some online guilty gear +r!\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nP.S.S.\nHere is my \"little\" Guilty Gear AC Core +R Guide

the best fighters ever!\n\nWhy?\nBecause it offers more freedom of choice than other fighters.\nHow?\nFor instance, in most fighting games, you're (rightfully) quite screwed if you do a bad jump. In Guilty Gear you don't stop thinking at the jump. Will the jumping character attack, air-block (or air-instant block, a sort of semi-parry) any ground normals, spend meter for blocking anti-air specials, double-jump, air-dash forward/backwards? (Not counting character specific stuff as triple jumping etc.)\n\nThe character (mechanics) design is quite extreme too, since almost every character has one or more exception from the standard game mechanics, like: triple jump, double air dash, parry, delayed wakeup on sweep, not being able to dash, being able to level up specials and supers, having a heat gauge that allows for more damaging normals but also running the risk of over-heating unless venting steam (yeah, really) and more... \n\n\nOf course, my recommendation is quite biased:\nI was a casual arcade game scrub since the start of the 1990s and took a liking for 2D fighting games.

The only problem is that the online for this game is dead. Guilty Gear has never been a mainstream series like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, so finding people to play online with is hard without arranging something ahead of time. When you do finally find someone to play with, you'll probably get crushed. The Guilty Gear scene has a small, but dedicated niche of players who are really, really good; some of them have been perfecting their skills since 2002, when the original release of XX dropped, and some even earlier than that. Not only that, but the netcode isn't exactly the best. Sometimes, you'll be fighting against the lag more than your actual opponent. There is plenty of content here for solo players to get some enjoyment, and the tried-and-true local multiplayer is still fine, but the online could use some work.

Variety is all over the place in this one.\n\n[*] Online matches can be dodgy, due to delay and could be a lot better with proper server connection.

For those who are not familiar: Guilty Gear is a heavily combo-based fighting game. It's fast-paced and requires a lot of skill to get good.\n\nThe port is very well done and Arc System Works (the developer) is always providing bugfixes and making improvements on this PC version. With 25 characters to choose from and a lot of game modes to keep you occupied and challenge you (offline and online), Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R is worth the money if you're into fighting games.\n\nPROS:\n\n+ 25 very different characters. There's no Ryu / Ken here. Each one is unique\n+ CPU is very good at reading your moves and one of the best I've ever seen\n+ Soundtrack is phenomenal. You'll certainly rise the BGM volume in-game\n+ Great story and easy to understand, even if you never played any GG game\n+ Online is good, unless you're playing with someone very very far away from you\n+ Skill-heavy gameplay. You're always on the edge of your seat\n+ Works with different types of controllers and arcade sticks\n\nMIXED:\n\n> There's no tutorial, making it harder to start if you're not familiar with fighting games\n> Arcade mode boss is very cheap. This can be good or bad. Depends on you\n\nCONS:\n\n-  There's no combo practice mode. I like to create my own combos, but some suggestions from the devs would be welcome\n\n---\n\nBottom line: If you're a fan of fighting games, this is a no-brainer + you'll have a lot of fun! If you're starting on the genre, I would recommend Street Fighter (any of them, because of the easier inputs), Skullgirls (great tutorial to introduce you to fighting games in general) or BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend / Chrono Phantasma (good tutorial and combo practice mode).", "timestamp_created": 1432989357, "timestamp_updated": 1433362010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.662974", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16075761": {"recommendationid": "16075761", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994173129", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 16543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519633794}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u66fe\u7ecf\u6597\u5267\u9879\u76ee\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e13\u7528\u683c\u6597\u795e\u4f5c\u3001\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u4e0d\u7167\u987e\u65b0\u624b\u3001\u8981\u7ec3\u597d\u57fa\u672c\u529f\u624d\u597d\u73a9~\n\n\u4e5d\u5b57\u771f\u8a00\uff1a\u61c2\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u613f\u6253\u6869\u3001\u6562\u5b9e\u6218\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=884650171\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=889331073\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=900164230", "timestamp_created": 1432986007, "timestamp_updated": 1491616902, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16075117": {"recommendationid": "16075117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020190599", "num_games_owned": 389, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446759107}, "language": "english", "review": "You should have this game.\n\nWhy?

Asi que considerando eso, no es un juego \"viejo\".\n\nSegundo: Para aquellos que solo jugaron la version AC Plus, esta revision es como comparar la version Vanilla de KOF XIII con la version Climax, hay muchas cosas que cambian en los movimientos de los personajes, las versiones EX estan mucho mas balanceadas, Kliff y Justice son personajes decentes, mas combos para todos los personajes, etc. Es la version definitva de GG por encima de XRD que tiene menos personajes, un pesimo balance y apenas viene con la nueva expansion que de fijo costar\u00e1 full price como paso con BB CP Extend.

And trust me; there is plenty of stuff related to GGX2. For the record, I don't count Guilty Gear Isuka as part of the Guilty Gear X2 re-releases. I don't care how many A.B.A. fans I upset when I say that, either. After Guilty Gear X2's initial release, fighting game fans got hit with plenty of remakes of Arc System's crazy chaos combat contest. Thus, you might be wondering if you should bother picking up this game. Well, yes, you should. Look at it this way: do you want the most up to date character roster, the most balanced move set, the most information regarding the Guilty Gear mythos and the most modes alongside the classic arcade and versus? Of course you do! Anyone can see that GGX2ACP is the game to get for those who want the most out of the world of Guilty Gear. Trust me when I say that there is plenty of \u201cmost\u201d for everyone.\n\nThose new to Guilty Gear might be a bit lost in terms of story. The cast of Guilty Gear is eccentric and wild; the types of people you want to hang around with at a party. Due to the aggressive and dangerous nature of Gears, bounty hunters and The Sacred Order of the Holy Knights alike waged a century long war to end the existence of all Gears. Tournaments have been held in the past to extinguish any remaining Gears and the ruler of all Gears: Justice. In doing so, the victors are granted money. Lots and lots money. That's the basic premise behind the Guilty Gear world, but the characters and their eccentricities are what make the game so special. There are no Ryu/Ken types here, thankfully. Instead, you have a huge cast you'd never expect to find. There is Bridgette, a transvestite who fights with yo-yos, stuffed animal and roller blades. There is also Slayer, a vampire with more power than a generator that controls a continent. Seriously, he blocks attacks with smoke from his pipe! We also have the beautiful Millia Rage, an assassin trained to use her gorgeous hair as a weapon. All of your favorites are back and one of the draws of Guilty Gear Accent Core Plus is the fact that two fan favorite characters have joined the roster: Kliff and Justice. While these overpowered jerks are rarely used in normal play or in tournaments, it's still great to see familiar faces and have such a huge variety of characters. With the up to date story mode, you can find out more about each unique character as they battle the entities known as Gears and the mysterious figure known only as \u201cThat Man.\u201d All characters have multiple endings in their story modes. Since each arc is short, you can see different sides of the tale.\n\nAlongside Story Mode, there is a new Survival Mode that allows you to level up your characters as you battle the computer. You can also play the regular Arcade, Training, Versus, M.O.M, Versus Computer and Two-vs.-Two Modes. Accent Core Plus will let you go on-line provided you have the proper PS2 attachments. Once a mode is picked, you select a character and once a character is picked, the fun begins again. The fighting is as hectic as ever yet still retains the familiarity of all of the predecessors. Characters have a variety of attacks, skills and the potential to chain them all together to create impressive combos that demand respect. All characters have strengths and weaknesses, but knowing how each character performs will lead to huge combos and a better understanding of how to battle other opponents. As usual, there is plenty to offer in Accent Core Plus in terms of strategy that goes beyond a standard combo. Techniques such as Faultless Defense, Roman Cancelling, False Roman Cancelling (more on those in a minute) and others are needed to fully get the most out of the fighting. All in all, fighting is a blast. The computer controlled AI does not pull any punches even on the easier difficulty settings. Practice makes perfect when it comes to picking a character that's right for you. This leads me to my biggest complaint about the game: the lack of a good practice mode. Sure, Training Mode gives you some options but it would have been nice to include a mode that gives you hints about the basics of 2D fighting, combo ideas and strategies. Considering this is the best version of Guilty Gear X2, an extra mode would have helped to sell the package and set it apart from the other releases. One of the good things that the Training Mode offers is that it allows you to learn the input of executing a False Roman Cancel. False Roman Cancels, or FRCs, allow you to stop most attacks mid-animation and either follow up with an impressive combo or dash away in case an attack missed. They're very important, but also very trick to learn. Since all characters have different FRCs, learning the timing for each of them will take effort. However, this effort is worth it and it was a good move on Arc's part to include the FRC practice feature.\n\nDespite the lack of a more involved Training Mode, there are some great things to point out that you can only find in Accent Core Plus: bonus material. As you complete the various challenges, you'll unlock stunning artwork. Fans know that the illustrations in Guilty Gear have always been amazing and what better way to see them than as a reward for winning a tough match? Get ready to see the Game Over screen and hit the start button while a countdown begins. Luckily, the rewards for your troubles are well worth it. Once again, anime is the central theme in the graphics department. Animations and scenery look like they should: excellent and full of vivid details. The rock and roll inspired soundtrack is back in full swing, as well. For those of you that buy the game new, you will get the OST on a separate disc so you can rock out with your...well...you know....when not playing Guilty Gear. Finally, all of the voice acting is in Japanese.\n\nThe best thing about Guilty Gear X2 Accent Core Plus is that it has everything a fan of the series could want with just enough extra stuff to set it apart from other remakes of X2. To me, the best part is the free soundtrack. However, even without it, this is still an excellent 2D fighting game from a legendary franchise. All of the characters and their crazy moves, the gorgeous graphics, the awesome music and the endless amount of options available to you make this game one worth checking out. Having now fully immersed myself in both BlazBlue and Guilty Gear, I can easily say that Guilty Gear is the better of the two. Both series are great, but there is something about Guilty Gear that sets it just above its counterpart. If that's not going to convince you to purchase Guilty Gear X2 Accent Core Plus, then nothing will.\n\n\nReviewer's Score: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1432939027, "timestamp_updated": 1432939027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450693", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16066141": {"recommendationid": "16066141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048588921", "num_games_owned": 728, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432932551}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30d6\u30ea\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8\u304b\u308f\u3044\u3044\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1432938038, "timestamp_updated": 1432938038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16065454": {"recommendationid": "16065454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024595988", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478899688}, "language": "english", "review": "The final and most polished entry of the Guilty Gear XX series.

Not at a level the game really and truly needs, but honestly no netcode out there is.  \n\nRegardless, Guilty Gear is another one of the classic fighters to hit Steam. It was one of the first fighting games I played more than a little bit and the one that got me hooked on to the fighting game genre. The game is fast paced and even now remains one of the most technically complex 2D fighters out there. If you're looking for a \"deep\" fighter with a diverse cast, look no further. Guilty Gear has it all and is a pleasure to play at both low and high levels. It is quite a time sink though if you take it seriously, but still enjoyable casually. I honestly feel that the game is more accessible than something like Street Fighter 4 since it generally relies on chain combos rather than links making lower level combos not too bad. But at the same time the combos at the higher end can be much more difficult.\n\nUnfortunately the port doesn't really polish much (or anything?), though the only real glaring age issue is that the sound effect audio quality (not the soundtrack) is extremely low.

If you want to buy this game solely for online mode, forget about it. It's not that GGXXAC+R's netcode is bad or anything (it's actually quite decent). Fighting games are meant to be played with friends, face-to-face. It's way more fun to play with a bunch of guys, sitting behind the screen, cheering for the underdog,screaming when something dope happen etc you know what I mean. Plus, network delay is one of the main reason I dont bother with playing online anymore. It just doesnt feel right at all when you're used to playing with delay-free situation (this is what gamer usually aim for regardless of what game they play). However. spending a bit of time with online mode isnt so bad. But still, I'm not recommend playing on online mode.\n\nSo, if you're not buying this game because of the online mode, why should you buy it then? Well, for starter, It's GUILTY GEAR ffs, the game  that havent released a new version on PC for like 10 years. New story to be discovered. Believe me when I say this, but GGXXAC+R's story is absolutely awesome (yeah, I kinda went through the whole story mode when there was a GGXXAC PS2 rom on PCSX2)\n\nWhat's more to add? Arcade mode's got enhanced with the addition to the hidden Order-Sol Boss (that bastard is really hard to chew), Boss I-no's got a quite few tweak herself with the addition of disabling Instant Kill, making it more challenging\n\nSurvival mode is quite cool as well, you have to ability to power-up your character after defeating each boss. Still. no save function. But hey, it's survival mode. Why do you even need a save function for?\n\nSaving the best for last, we have the major gameplay update. More balance than the previous versions, more mechanics to vastly improve the \"every-situation-has-an-answer\" property, namely throw break, slashback (this one is quite hard to use effectively though). Then we have 2 new characters (A.B.A and Order-Sol) and 2 re-balanced character that was consider OP and was ban from every Tournament (yes, I'm talking about Kliff and Justice)\n\nTL;DR: 10/10 would buy for the game's content", "timestamp_created": 1432813779, "timestamp_updated": 1432813779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.387097", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16036548": {"recommendationid": "16036548", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971678784", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499500645}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally, Arc System Works ports one of their incredible fighting games themselves, bringing the Accent Core series to the PC for the first time.

Easily the most well-balanced entry of the series and sports the largest cast as well coming in at 25 combatants. For gameplay modes it sports Arcade, story, vs, team vs, mission, survival, training, & online. There is also a gallery in which you can view at atwork and other content you have unlock while playing.\n\nThe online play is touchy subject of this title as it can be really good or really bad entirely based on the distance from other players. For example the online feels next to perfect playing against my friend who lives about 40 minutes away by car but playing random people online, it can show some seriously bad input lag. It should also be noted there is no spectating or lobbies for that matter if that was something which interested you.\n\nAs for the port, it runs a lot smoother than the steam store page would lead you to expect with the high recommend specs, so much so i'd guess the real recommended specs are much lower. The only serious port issue i've encountered at this time is no way in-game to exit the game, but that is said to be on a 'To-Do' list. Its also nice that they throw in the OST for the game as an added bonus (though it should be noted certain shared tracks in the game itself are in the included Guilty Gear XX #Reload OST instead of this one, so view this more like an OST expansion).\n\nI really recommend this game as the ideal starting point if you want to get into Guilty Gear, though it should be noted Guilty Gear does have a learning curve, so don't expect good results running up blind against a seasoned player.

If you want to go back in time, switch to AC mode in the Game Options menu.\n[*]Adds arcade-only sidebars!\n[*]Dev team seems committed, some issues already patched out in the first 24 hours.\n[*]Self-published, adds a glimmer of hope for future releases.\n[*]Controllers and arcade sticks recognized by default, and full keyboard bindings are available as well as a separate menu.\n[*]Netplay allows inviting via Steam friends list.[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list][*]Connections always read as 4-bars, and delay is significant across the board. Connections that were acceptable on PS3 are slower here. (Upside: connections are significantly smoother, no bursts of delay. Hopefully the standard delay is fixable.)\n[*]Not much in the way of resolution support, and playing in fullscreen has issues. (If your monitor is >60Hz, the game will read 60fps but run faster. Fullscreen also seems to add additional input delay.)\n[*]Windowed by default, and resolution options are limited. (Default is 1280x720, native res, good enough imo.)\n[*]Game reads controllers, but assigns buttons incorrectly - though prompts will read \"B\" to cancel, you need to press \"X\", for example.\n[*]Windows decides who is Player 1 and who is Player 2 - the game does not ask you to select a side when you start. This also leads to issues like Windows treating you as Player 2, forcing you to bind keys for that side, while netplay only uses Player 1's binds. Only a serious issue re: netplay, since every offline mode works fine as 2P.\n[*]Tabbing back into the game if it wasn't on top causes brief (1-2s) slowdown.[/list]\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n[b]It's AC+R on PC.[/b] As things stand now, it's only good for offline play, but netplay stands a decent chance of getting fixed.

\nmechanics.\n \n\nPROS:\n\n- a solid and rewarding Fighting game, it is difficult to learn (or stop to be a button smasher) and much more difficult to be a good or a competitive player.\n- Huge and colorful 2D hand-draw Sprites and maps\n- includes a good IA., in maniac mode it can be a challenge. \n- It includes all reglamentary game modes (ARCADE, VS CPU, SURVIVAL, VS PLAYER, PRACTICE, ONLINE) and extra ones (M.O.M, TEAM VS CPU, TEAM VS PLAYER, Story, Mission )\n\nCONS:\n\n- you can't stretch the game to fit your Screen. in other words you will have two border despite resolution or mode you choose (windowed or full)\n- the netcode is not for slow connections, if you have a crappy connection below to 8mb, forget it. \n\n\nIMPROVEMENTS SINCE RELOAD:\n\n- a completely new Story mode follows the events of RELOAD.\n- now you can choose the map or the music you want to fight (simply but is a nice touch)\n- 2 NEW characters were added, A.B.A. from Guilty Gear Isuka and Order SOl from Guity Gear Slash (consoles and arcade JAPAN only)\n- Cliff and Justice were re-added on RELOAD (Unlockebles) but their mechanics has been improved to be use in tournaments (AKA. they are not overpower anymore)\n- all arworks and voice-overs for all characters have been redone \n- you can choose between 2 different voice acting for SOL and ORDER SOL, Daisuke Ishiwatari (it's creator) and Jouji Nakata (George)\n- a new announcer (it depends of your tastes he can like you or annoy you)\n- all the maps has been improved and they added it's alternative versions from isuka, maps like FRASCO or CHINA looks really good.\n- you can unlock exclusive illustrations for the gallery or if you clear the story mode you can unlock secret voice actor interviews\n\nthis is a new game for PC gamers, we

Este jogo \u00e9 a revis\u00e3o final (e provavalmente definitiva) da saga \"XX\" de Guilty Gear.\n\nHouveram tr\u00eas Guilty Gears entre o XX # Reloaded e o Accent Core + R, nenhum destes disponiveis infelizmente na Steam: Slash que portou a novata A.B.A de I s u k a al\u00e9m de um nova vers\u00e3o de Sol Badguy no seu tempo da \"Holy Order\", al\u00e9m que diversos personagens ganharam novos golpes, al\u00e9m de claro um rebalanceamento.\n\nAccent Core finalmente mudou os artworks e narrador que estavam sendo usados desde Guilty Gear XX original (isso s\u00e3o quatro jogos!), tamb\u00e9m com novos cen\u00e1rios e dublagens (alguns se aposentaram ou trocaram de ramo, como a dubladora do Bridget, Hiroko Konishi). Por\u00e9m por alguns bugs de \"travamento\" foi feito logo depois exclusivo para os consoles o \"Accent Core+\", que tamb\u00e9m trazia um novo story mode, miss\u00f5es e retorno de Kliff e Justice que tinham sido cortados no AC original (ainda sim eles eram banidos para campeonatos).\n\nEnt\u00e3o finalmente em Setembro de 2012 foi lan\u00e7ado Guilty Gear Accent Core + R para a placa arcade RingEdge 2 da Sega. Al\u00e9m de \"novamente\" mais uma revis\u00e3o do jogo finalmente Kliff e Justice foram adaptados em vers\u00f5es competitivas, antes disso Accent Core tinha sido portado no final de 2012 para PSN e XBLA, Arc System Works ent\u00e3o portou o upgrade de gra\u00e7a de 2013 em diante. Est\u00e1 \u00e9 a vers\u00e3o dispon\u00edvel na STEAM.\n\nConteudo:\n\nAcredito que muitos pularam de Guilty Gear XX # Reloaded para este jogo se somente seguiram a s\u00e9rie pelo PC, os novos personagens ent\u00e3o s\u00e3o:\n\nA.B.A - Uma personagem com 2 modos: um com mobilidade limitada e outra por tempo limitado com muito mais vers\u00e1tilidade por\u00e9m com perigo ao acabar o modo. Ela luta junto de seu \"amigo\" chave Paracelcus\nOrder Sol - Sol Badguy mais \"jovem\", com as vestes da \"Holy Order\" seu estilo de luta \u00e9 menos \"lapidado\" como a vers\u00e3o atual, al\u00e9m que conta com um novo gameplay baseado em golpes \"melhorados\" provenientes do uso de uma segunda barra de \"Charge\".\nKliff Undersn - O comandante chefe da \"Holy Order\", seu gameplay foi adptado para \"stunar\" seu inimigo com seus golpes, por\u00e9m h\u00e1 um risco de usando ele errado o jogador acabar com Kliff \"stunado\"\nJustice - A \"chefona\" do primeiro Guilty Gear, o \"primeiro\" Gear, retorna com grande parte de suas op\u00e7\u00f5es de movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o cortada (sem nenhum tipo de dash e apenas pulo duplo), seu gameplay consiste em \"zonear\" seu oponente para conseguir \"tension\" e assim finalmente partir pra cima, ainda sim \u00e9 um personagem que requer bastante paci\u00eancia.\n\nO game cont\u00e9m diversos modos: Story, Arcade, M.O.M, Survival, Training, Team VS...bastante coisa para se distrair estando sozinho com o jogo. O modo de hist\u00f3ria n\u00e3o tem cutscenes, anima\u00e7\u00f5es ou musicas durante os di\u00e1logos como os da s\u00e9rie BlazBlue mas cumprem seu trabalho de dar mais personalidade aos lutadores do game.\n\nModo online infelizmente \u00e9 um retrocesso em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 como olhar uma partida online, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 lobbies (somente salas 1 vs 1) e o netplay \u00e9 basedo em \"delay\" em um jogo que h\u00e1 recursos como o de \"encurtar\" golpes que s\u00f3 podem ser feitos em um tempo bem especifico. O netcode \u00e9 o mesmo da vers\u00e3o console, teria sido \u00f3timo se Arc System Works tivesse ido um pouco al\u00e9m e melhorado para a vers\u00e3o PC, infelizmente isso n\u00e3o aconteceu.\n\nSe voc\u00ea joga descompromissado e tem amigos pr\u00f3ximos para jogar online, o game cumpre o papel. Caso queira partidas s\u00e9rias e que tu sabe que seu comando vai sair como quer nas partidas, infelizmente as chances s\u00e3o grandes de se decepcionar jogando online o game.\n\nN\u00e3o h\u00e1 muito conteudo novo ou exclusivo da vers\u00e3o STEAM. Ela cont\u00e9m uma op\u00e7\u00e3o extra do arcade de artwork lateral din\u00e2mico usando as artes dos personagens de Accent Core +, nos consoles \u00fanico do tipo \u00e9 um com versoes \"chibi\" dos personagens. O game nas op\u00e7\u00f5es pelo visto tamb\u00e9m conta com a antiga vers\u00e3o Accent Core, por\u00e9m n\u00e3o testei a mesma.\n\nControle:\n\nO input do game foi adaptado para teclados e arcade \"hitbox\" segundo um dos desenvolvedores, al\u00e9m de claro o b\u00e1sico de poder reconfigurar os bot\u00f5es de teclado.\n\nNa quest\u00e3o de controle eles simplesmente fizeram o trabalho mais f\u00e1cil: apenas suporte bom para pads e arcades que suportem \"X Input\", ent\u00e3o sim \u00e9 preciso o uso de \"xboxce\" para que certos controles e arcades funcionem no jogo.\n\nPalavras Finais:\n\nVale a pena? Se o foco n\u00e3o for jogar online s\u00e9rio, Guilty Gear Accent Core + R \u00e9 um \u00f3timo jogo da s\u00e9rie. Muitos modos, personagens e \u00e9 bem garantido ser a \"vers\u00e3o suprema\" do ultimo Guilty Gear \"2D puro\", do contr\u00e1rio \u00e9 melhor esperar um desconto (apesar de finalmente ser um jogo da ASW com pre\u00e7o localizado para n\u00f3s brasileiros) ou uma chance que algum f\u00e3 desenvolva um netplay por fora como aconteceu com Melty Blood Current Code.\n\nCompre tamb\u00e9m se quer incentivar novos ports da ASW na STEAM pois \u00e9 o primeiro game em que Arc System Works \u00e9 publisher na plataforma.

Though its usually good news when more Japanese publishers pour games into steam!\n\nThe steam version though is pretty much like playing on PSN, 4:3 format with the 2 bars on both sides of the screen.\nNot much on graphical changes since this game was on PS2 but the GGXXAC+R has its changes from the last update.  It does change the game quite a bit.  Brings back good memories at the arcade. SP plays just fine, MP is a lagfest but didn't expect MP to be great anyway (My expectation from PSN for MP wasn't great to begin with). Hopefully games like GGXRD will fix that... right???\n\nAny way, I'd recommend this game for hard core fighting game fans and if you like Blazblue series, you'll like this diverse game.\n\nIf you're into SF Series, give it a try, it may surprise you.

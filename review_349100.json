The Android (My personal favorite) highest health, doesn\u2019t need to eat and has a spectacular carry weight. These perks come with a price the price being energy drain and repair kits required to heal. Our last and final character The Psionic has it\u2019s own tutorial and is one of the more difficult to play characters in my experience. A very slow food drain and overtime energy regen are the perks that come with playing The Psionic however The Psionic has the lowest health and can\u2019t carry items.\n\nGameplay: Survival Elements\n\n\nYou have your basic food health and energy bars these all are important unless your character doesn\u2019t use food. Speaking of food there are multiple ways to fill your belly the most basic is gathering some delicious fungi with a food generator being your greatest source once you have the supplies. Energy well doing what it\u2019s name implies powers certain items and is The Psionic\u2019s most valuable asset. Crafting is another key survival element that makes any survival game and the crafting is a simple click one item then click another to combine them it isn\u2019t a fancy material based one but it still gave me the same enjoyment when combining items to build a weapon to fight for my life with. Temperatures oh the dreaded cold and heat it could be your best friend or your worst nightmare if you can\u2019t keep your temp just right. Finding ways to balance the temp wasn\u2019t too hard but if you don\u2019t pay attention to it you might end up dying.\n\nGameplay: Combat\n\nCombat depends on what character you play. The Psionic uses runes that when combined certain ways make different abilities. The Human and Android use guns to eliminate hostile threats. The Alien uses claws to slice and dice its way to victory. Now while combat is fun it can be avoided using stealth. \n\nDifficulty: Something that can scare people away from a game is difficulty. There are 3 settings wimp, medium, and hard. Wimp has little energy and food drain while medium offers the normal food and energy drain and hard makes enemies aggressive on top of the food and energy drain. A problem with this golden survival game is the tutorial. The Basic Training Tutorial took sometime to complete due to the tutorial messages being a little vague on certain mechanics like the food generator but it wasn\u2019t hard to figure out how to put ether into it.\n\nPros:\nGreat survival elements\nMultiple endings\nMultiple characters\nSimple yet great crafting system\nMultiple play-styles\nStealth mechanics\nCombat is fun\nModdable\nMap Editor\n\nCons:\nSome tutorial text Is too vague\nDated graphics\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

I was pleasantly surprised by the ample amount of crafting recipes and items; you could turn common weapons into harbinger of doom, or take corpses of those plant monsters to turn them into turrets.  It's pretty good, and I would even go to say that the crafting is much more elaborated than most survival games.  It also has 6 endings that are vastly different, and finding them all is part of the fun.\n\nSome of its puzzles might be obtuse though, mostly due to certain key items spawning at random, obscure places, such as the very first key opening a fortress further in the game, but aside from that, and despite the variety, it gets pretty dull as the environments are rather empty, despite the items and graphics being randomized on each playthroughs, and the square maps are laid differently.  Think of it as a robot having to put 200 random dots on pieces of paper, they're arguably different, but to the human eye, not by much.\n\nI think that's the point, so that you wouldn't find resources in the same place between playthoughs, but I was getting really tired of having to cross these large maps that ultimately left nothing to be desired aside from their respective ending.  Plus, in my game, I would have one map to the west of the starting point, two on the east, and all of the rest to the north, which meant that if I had to go to the desert which is the nothernmost point, I had to do a lot of backtracking just to get the key for the aforementionned fortress, or just to transport stuff.\n\nIf you're nuts for survival games with ample of possibilities, you'll definitely like this game.  As for me though, after seeing all of the endings, I shut the game off, said \"Yup\", regarding it as an enjoyable enough experience, and left it as that.  I never want to play this thing again, I would start hating it if I'd have to listen to the droning musics any longer.

The game is a bit hard, based on your style and which character you picked. For human I.e it is not easy to go out in the dark with extreme cold at the night or extreme hot at desert area without preparations, sometimes your death will be swift if you start without finding good supply and wondered in wrong maps without knowing! Sometimes you will venture long till you discover your character is starving and die with hunger, but in general the game because easier with each run, u discover how to use things in better ways, what expected from each map u visited, and what's ur character weakness and strength, all in the hard way.\n\nas you can expected, i played the game when it was like version 1.2 or something and followed it till the dev. decided to focus more on his space starship game, he had like 3 models without textures at that time, so hopefully there is something new in this version, if it is small and insignificant i would still looking forward to see it. (edit: I found a weird thing that seems doesn\u2019t belong to the theme, wonder if this is the secrete, but it was fun)\n\nWhat only worries me in this game \u2026 why is it sold for 2 dollars? People might get confused and think it is a bad quality games, I enjoyed playing this game more than a lot of games that I bought for 10-25$", "timestamp_created": 1456621666, "timestamp_updated": 1456621666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480769", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21467986": {"recommendationid": "21467986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046216943", "num_games_owned": 643, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456460289}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid game, absolutely worth two bucks.

Downsides are they lose energy constantly so you need constant supply(kinda like needing food) and they can't heal like other characters, you need repair units.\n[*] Alines can become really strong end game. Downsides are they have increased hunger and can't use tech. They differ from other races with their ability to evolve. Completing certain tasks evolves your alien so you get stuff like better night vision, different attacks etc.\n[*] Psionic has complete different play style from other races.

Probably one of my most favoured games of all time, I can't believe it's on Steam! I dropped the $1.99 in about a second! \nNotrium is a survival game. You play as one of 4 characters from a crew that crashlands on an alien planet. Your goal is to survive, be it that you find a way offworld, or take presedence over the locals and become ze' ubermanche. There is the Human, Alien, Android and Psionic. I personally prefer the Human and Alien to the other two races, because of the amount of gameplay each presents. Notrium hits the \"Survival\" Part right on the money. You constantly have to moniter your temperature and hunger, as well as focusing on the whole NOT DYING part. I sincerely hope Ville releases workshop for this game, due to the huge amount of moddability. Someone modded this into a side scroller guys! How crazy is that?

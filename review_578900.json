If the final fifth chapter impacts this review, I will update it accordingly. I am also a man.)\n\nFemale-driven visual novels have become increasingly common among western audiences. Unfortunately, these games are also peppered with groan-inducing young boys seeking to win the hearts of adolescent girls through affection. Where are the games with dark storytelling and evil men, and why is it taboo for women to fantasize about them? Demonheart wisely accommodates this void with a cast of evil love interests and a thought-provoking dark narrative.\n\nTo understand the nuances of Demonheart, we must trace its origins back to the PC game, Neverwinter Nights. Demonheart originated as a mod, given life as this visual novel. This visual novel is mostly a rehashed story from the mod; however, there are enough new surprises to satisfy returning players, especially since the original mod was never finished.\n\nThe major flaw in transitioning Demonheart from an action role-playing game to a visual novel is the difference in scope. When we subtract the combat and exploration, what's left is a condensed story barely enough to qualify as a short visual novel, clocking in at about ten hours. Regardless, the story expertly weaves a powerful narrative into these limited hours, and the universe the story provides leaves open the possibility for future sequels.\n\nThe protagonist is a beautiful young woman named Bright. She can be anything the player wants, from honest and affectionate to deceitful and cruel. One feature that faithfully makes its transition from Neverwinter Nights is that everything Bright says is produced through the player selecting decision prompts. Typical visual novels only provide these opportunities a few times a game; Demonheart provides hundreds. Admittedly, most of these decisions are an illusion of choice, but because the player won't always know what decisions impact the story, it's suspenseful nonetheless. Bright will be presented a number of evil (or good) opportunities to provide an outlet for a player's dark fantasies while the game monitors her progress with a built-in alignment system.\n\nThe alignment system, unfortunately, feels a bit superficial. In just 20 minutes, the player can max out their choice of alignment. Most games use alignment as a progression system to track the player over an entire narrative, but in Demonheart it feels tacked on to accommodate returning Neverwinter Nights players. Nonetheless, its inclusion is a feel-good ego boost for players to have the peace of mind knowing their good or evil decisions are having an impact.\n\nDemonheart is a dark story, and the weight is carried by its antiheroes, Brash and Raze. Both are potential love interests, imposing their sexual emotions upon Bright. Brash is a powerful and irritable knight, openly disdaining anyone he remotely disagrees with. He's also incredibly sexist and brutally honest about it. Meanwhile, Raze is a demon working from the shadows, whispering dark suggestions into Bright's head and isn't shy about conquering her. Most games driven by female protagonists exhibit bad-boys as basic delinquents; in Demonheart, these bad-boys are genuinely evil men, exhibiting  ruthlessness and sexual perversions uncharacteristic of most female protagonist games.\n\nThese perversions are given further clarity with voice acting. For a small-scale visual novel, I was nervous at its inclusion; voice acting when done poorly can ruin an otherwise great game. The developer wisely invested time into patiently selecting a commendable cast of performers. The voice acting ranges from below average to impressive. The worst is from Bright's mother, who lacks enthusiasm. The best performances, thankfully, are from the main supporting actors, Brash and Raze who perfectly capture their personalities. The two have a unique accent as Brash possesses a rough demanding voice while Raze presents himself as a suave sophisticated playboy. Sometimes, they can deliver a line that falls flat, or perhaps their microphone is too close or far from their face, but it's rare enough to ignore.\n\nThe artwork for the characters and the fictional world they inhabit is both distinct and beautiful. The characters possess a combination of striking eyes with normal human features, possibly inspired from Neverwinter Night's fantasy portrait art. The backgrounds share details from old oil paintings, which is a pleasant comparison to the story's dark fantasy setting. Some early critics shared animosity at early impressions of the game's artwork, but after seeing the totality of the artistic marriage, I am convinced the art is successful.\n\nOne major omission from the art in contrast to its Neverwinter Night's mod is the sex. The mod was not under sexual scrutiny from Steam, allowing for a different depiction of the characters, especially Brash. That version of Brash was a sex-craved addict who practiced what he preached, consequently making him more unpredictable and dangerous. By comparison, Brash in the visual novel is still violent, but stops short at having sex, as if he knows he's being monitored by the ratings board. Not even the protagonist calling him \"queer\" impacts Brash, for under the watchful eye of parents, Brash knows his hands are tied as he's met his match. Oh, but don't worry, it's totally fine if he kills people, right?\n\nDemonheart may lack in explicit sex, but it still provides an unforgettable unique story showcased by its powerful and sexually suggestive cast of antiheroes. It explores a dark female-driven narrative appealing to both male and female audiences, and succeeds better than some had originally thought at the transition from a Neverwinter Nights mod to full-fledged visual novel. Oh, and Lamb, if you're reading this, write a sex scene into the chapter 5 ending. Cut to black if you have to. \n\n[b]Final Score: 9/10.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1515835585, "timestamp_updated": 1515842605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39169254": {"recommendationid": "39169254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179360631", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 265, "last_played": 1515373381}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played through chapters 1-4 (Chapter 5 not released at the time I am posting).

It didn't think it would be that good as there's quite a lot of these on steam but after I started playing I really got sucked into the story!\n\nAs there's only three chapters out so far I'd give it like an 7/10 recommend.\n\nThe story is interesting and keeps you entertained. The artwork is nice and the characters are too. There are plenty of options when responding to events in the game and it actually feels like most of your choices matter. A lot of these games make it so obvious that you need to select specific answers in order to get very specific outcomes, but with this one I was able to play how I wanted to and have the story end up the way I wanted without having to follow any kind of guide and on my first play through; Maybe I was just lucky though. I like that not all answers affect your character's personality which adds a bit more depth to the story while giving more flexibility in how you choose your answers.\n\nA few wishes for the game though, would be:\n\n*A longer story. \nThis isn't to say I'm not happy with the length of the chapters because they are quite long and fleshed out but I don't think that five chapters is enough for what you pay compared to other games of this kind, I know some of those games are dirt cheap and the good ones can charge a LOT but they are pretty good quality and I see that kind of potential here. I bought the game with 20% off and feel like it was quite worth it at that price ($15). In saying that I would be happy to pay around $30 for ten chapters each with the same chapter length that is already there, realistically. But that's just my own opinion.\n\n*More characters that impact the story would definitely be a plus.\nHaving only two characters that it seems like you can romance doesn't seem like quite enough. Maybe another two would make it more interesting but you'd need to be careful not to let this take away from each character's story/personality.\n\n*More CG's in the story.\nYou really only get one or two good CG's in the three chapters that you can play. I'm not expecting to get much more because there is only supposed to be five chapters coming out and this is really disappointing. The artwork in this game is good and the creators would definatley benefit from putting more CG's into the game.\n\nSo far I recommend buying this only with the sale until all the chapters come out at least (:\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511659619, "timestamp_updated": 1511659619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37422533": {"recommendationid": "37422533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082543313", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2094, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514222649}, "language": "english", "review": "seduces people as much as possible.\n\nI am bad kitten.hehehe", "timestamp_created": 1511560079, "timestamp_updated": 1511560079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444444", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36748946": {"recommendationid": "36748946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044436766", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514332849}, "language": "english", "review": "I was unsure of this game at 1st but found the story captivating and am eagerly awaiting 4 the rest of the chapters.", "timestamp_created": 1511378413, "timestamp_updated": 1511378413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36411857": {"recommendationid": "36411857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145638592", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514272780}, "language": "english", "review": "The storyline is what hooked me.

I would have to put my recommendation at more like 85%.  Many of the other fine reviews on here point out many of the game's strong points: world crafting, character crafting, beautiful set pieces, etc. etc.  All of this is true.\n\nHowever, as the game is only come out with 3 out of the 5 chapters at the time of this review, it does come off, at least to me, as being a little short for the $20 price tag.  This problem is made even more noticeable with the absence of any effective form of \"fast forward\" mechanic; which, effectively, limits re-playability.  You can get many more hours of entertainment out of some of the other fine VNs on Steam for a lot less money.  That being said, the last 2 chapters are coming, and hopefully they will bring a LOT more story and value to the table with them.\n\nBut, all of that being said, if you've got the extra cash, and like DARK VNs, this is a great way to spend an afternoon.\n", "timestamp_created": 1507291295, "timestamp_updated": 1507291295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597784", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35140914": {"recommendationid": "35140914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049426667", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504490422}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh man, I am so glad I backed this game on IndieGoGo! I'm always a bit hesitant to back games like that, but this was definitely a winner. \n\nWhere to start? \n\nPros!\n- I love the fact that there are numerous choices and extremely frequent at that! Most VN games have you make a choice once every 20 min of real time continuous game play, which can get a bit boring after a while when it's all reading and less choosing. I like having more choices, but I find myself rewinding a lot just to see how they all play out!\n- Love that you can really truly build your own character with this game. You are not a cookie cutter docile doormat for everyone to tromp about, like in several other VN titles. \n- Sexy mansprites, mmm.\n- Just gorgeous art all around.\n- Music is nice and appropriate for each setting; same with the sound effects.\n- Enjoyable cryptographs to solve (I think that's what they are called? Or word jumbles?)\n- Characters are memorable and great personality-wise.\n- Lots of fun twists in this game, definitely expect the unexpected, and I am sure more to come!\n- Devs actually releasing chapters when they say they will and keep their promises unlike other devs... this makes me trust them and want to buy more games from them in the future (keep up the awesome work!)\n- If you backed this on IndieGogo, they sent out little padlocks with characters on them depending on the level of support... so now I have a padlock with a sexy demon man on it to bedazzle my...uh... anything that could use a demonman padlock! xDDD\n\nThe only \"cons\" right now...and I say that loosely because some of these aren't really cons, but just either room for improvement or it's such a different flavor that I am not used to it yet... :-x\n- Have to wait for each chapter to come out. (Can't wait! AHHH!)\n- I had no idea that I was supposed to be solving a puzzle to \"translate\" the demon language in this game. (Sorry if that is a spoiler... but yea, they did not really explain that at all, or maybe it was explained and I just missed it somehow? But I constantly kept clicking \"give up\" because I didn't understand what the heck was I supposed to do.)\n- Some of the outcomes of choices don't really make any sense... but at the same time, this could be considered a \"pro\" since oftentimes VNs are too predictable...\n- Voice acting can be a bit...uh, rough at times. But hey, I would rather have this than no voice acting so I guess I can't complain too much. The voice acting helps me keep my attention focused (I have really bad ADHD so it can be tricky to stay focused even with an amazing story!)\n- Knowing exactly what happens when you pick something in terms of stat alignment is causing me to rewind and skew my choosing a bit... (e.g. \"oh crap that made me +1 evil, I wanted +1 tact instead!\" *savescums* LOL) One might argue this is good in the sense that you can really tailor your character to your own liking but I wish there was an option to toggle it off just to have a total blind playthrough...\n\n\nI plan to update this review as they release the remaining chapters.

The voice work is quite nice and aren\u2019t grating or out of place. The Demon in your head is especially witty.\n\nSo, you arrive to talk to Orchid after the summons, but soon find there are others who are meeting with her as well; a boy, a mean wench, and a rather suspicious looking hooded girl by the name of Ari. Orchid holds a contest to see who will work for her. You can select whichever choices you want when the moment comes, but if you\u2019re curious about how the responses will be, you can always save in the pause menu and reload.\n\nYou can also see how your responses are shaping your character overall. The character alignment shows various personalities Bright will take on depending on which answer you choose. There is Good/Evil and Tactful/Defiant. I\u2019m on the Tactful/Defiant alignment because I found myself immediately disliking Mark, Bright\u2019s betrothed. So I never responded nicely to him. You get the option later to [spoiler]kill Mark using a potion you can choose to keep when you\u2019re released from the dungeon[/spoiler]. And I so did it, no remorse. :) \n\nYou\u2019ll have instances where you decipher Demon Speak which is sort of like Scrabble, unscrambling words. You will also be identifying key objects of interest with your mouse in some scenes that will reveal more about the location you\u2019re in or more about the plot.\n\nThe one thing that often pulled me out of the story were the expletives. Some of them were alright and fit with the story and lore. Other times, they felt a little out of place with certain situations and dialogues because it caught me off guard or came out of nowhere. \n\nControls use a mouse to either click or select things on screen, so there\u2019s not much to it.\n\n[h1]Graphics/Music[/h1]\nThe art is gorgeous. The attention to each character and detail brings out their personality. Even more so when you hear their voices. The one thing that also stood out to me was that the world feels alive. The characters breathe and blink, smirk or squint. They feel more 3-dimensional for a VN where most of the time, the characters are images that don\u2019t move at all. Very nice touch.\n\nThe music is also fitting for the story and works well to build suspense and add to the drama overall. \n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\nI highly recommend Demonheart. It\u2019s a very different VN that does some things others have, but better. I enjoyed the voice work, the depth of the different characters, and the strange and mysterious story unfolding.\n\nEpisode 3 is slated to release August 21st, 2017 and I will definitely be all over that. So, if you enjoy VNs with some dark humor, gorgeous artwork, interesting cast of characters, and the ability to fully flesh out your protagonist and align them how you want, Demonheart is definitely one to pick up.\n\n[code]If this review/EAR helped you, please give it a thumbs-up.

You better believe it. \n\nFor the first time, I was actually shocked and delighted such a well designed visual novel existed. I really wish I could draw more attention to this game.\n\nWith their ambiently animated cast, it really added that tiny bit of realism into them so you didn't feel like you were just talking to a portrait like a low budget otome. You can feel as if you have more to look at than just words.\n\nThe characters were all fleshed out and ANY questions that arose were excellent for story progression and (HIDDEN) answers. \n\nReally well thought out in the fact that normally, whatever you feel as your own personal reaction to a situation will be a choice you can make. These heavy choices may be taken lightly, but they can alter your 'alignment' throughout your story; which actually DOES affect how characters react to you, or how things happen to you in the story; especially with your 'Infernal Patron'.\n\nThe story holds strong and may seem a bit fast paced if you're really rushing through to devour the story, or if you're a fast reader. Sometimes even I felt that it moved a bit fast, even for no reason. Honestly, I don't suggest blazing through this like some cheaply made Visual Novel or Otome. There is a lot of underlying story you need to pay attention to.\n\nHowever, it holds a very \"colorful\"(dangerous) world and somewhat predictable backgrounds. Sometimes, it feels like your choices don't really matter- and there are no threats to speaking your mind (Or simply opting to be a bitch) other than a character becoming annoyed with you for 2 seconds. There are times when a character may say or do something that won't make any sense, either- especially if you didn't gather everything storywise along the way. There was one time in which even that wasn't an excuse, and a character may become very... odd.\n\nThe backstory for each character (pointing fingers to the patron) gives you the insight to the bigger picture, which is very important to not be blindsided later on; and is in general, worth replaying to test all the choices to find them. It took me personally 3 playthroughs to realize my 'patron' didn't know what a goat was, and he seemed to have a great distaste for things the player could know or have read during the game. Either way, he might not take kindly to every choice you make. This 2nd main character is made up of your choices (Somewhat?? but is mostly an infernal ball of sass). All in all- he's very worth the play to 'meet' in the new chapter.\n\nVoice acting was the only SLIGHT negative as it was picked only for some lines. While sometimes you might expect something important spoken, it likely won't be, even if the comedic effect would worked better that way. \n\nI personally really loved what was available for this game, and truly and honestly recommend it for people who want to really feel inclusive in a story or play as a woman capable of being a badass 'don't need no man' type. \n\nI'll also say to buy it BEFORE it is complete, as the creators might raise the price.", "timestamp_created": 1500850347, "timestamp_updated": 1514947810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547361", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33319465": {"recommendationid": "33319465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324865986", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514748754}, "language": "english", "review": "LOVE IT!\nPlease do keep the chapters coming!!!

And most of the dialouge choices can actually change the perspective on how the other characters view Bright(The Main Character you will be playing) People an view you as A sweet angel to blood thisty monster, etc. \n\nThough if there were issues i would have with the game: while playing some of the  character protraits won't show up(usually happen when i'm doing the \"Good\" route of the game), so it can at times ruin the suspense or leave some people confused. \n\nAnother thing is the saving system, there is no quick save, there so skip dialounge button for those who are trying other paths. You can make seperate save files for the type of route you're doing but you have to make sure to lable it so you know which one to start from once news chapters are updated to the game. \n\nAnd with only two chapters out so far you can pretty much finish them within 2 hours or less if you just playing through one emotion spector.(Good/Evil/Defiant/Tactful) \n\nBut if the schedule they tell us is right we should have the other three chapters of this story by the end of 2017. (Here to hoping).  And a cool thing about this game, where others who are releasing chapters as they go may/will charge you an extra fee, this game is a pay once play for all.

The MC has the potential to be so refreshingly witty, wicked, and rebellious. She isn't someone who's put through the shredder only to come out the other end without even a 'fuck this', like the manaically docile protagonists you find everywhere. I live for revenge.\n\nPlayer choice is something that's often advertised but rarely followed through satisfyingly, and although I have yet to see how important all my choices are, it's extremely fun having some agency, even if it is just choosing a great come-back. Not to mention the dialogue can be very well thought out and the characterisation so far stays true to itself without resorting to archetypes - it makes it feel like the characters are well thought out and have a lot more going on below the surface. I'm also surprised that I had the best time[spoiler]exchanging jabs with Sir Brash; instead of feeling irritated or outraged on behalf of a little angelic MC, I realised their dynamic was actually really funny and they were on more equal footing than I thought[/spoiler]- I can't wait to see what kind of person he really is and watch as their relationship evolves. \n\nThe episodes so far have beenvery intriguing, and I even like the mini games - they made me feel smart! The story has a lot more momentum, relative to other visual novels/ dating games, and it was really atmospheric at times as you move through[spoiler]dungeons and camps sites and woods[/spoiler]etc. I think a lot of that can also be attributed to well placed background music and sounds. It really feels like an adventure. \n\nI only wish there was more content at the moment, as so far it's a little like reading the first two chapters of a good book and then putting it down - I must binge!

The plot is fantastically unique, the characters will suck you in, whether you end up loving or hating them. And Bright, the protagonist you play, feels like such a fleshed-out character, given how many options you're allowed in how you play her and how she reacts to the world around her. It also promises plenty of replay potential.\n\nHonestly, the only complaint I have is that I want more! I can't wait for the future chapters!

You can tell the desginers took their time working out every detail and making sure that the VR experience was smooth and flexible. I love the pick up system behind objects, the physics were spot on to blending with reality and the sound effects were timed correctly and realtisically.\n\nThe storyline was unique in itself but mirrored any 1960s-1970's spy movies or books in it's art and systems, yet with an updated technology bits, think about the Show \"Archer\", that should give you an idea of what the game looks and feels like. The theme music was amazing and I'm listneing to that on repeat while I write this review....and matched with the VR opening credits full immersion, that was great!!! I was already loving the game before I had any direct interactions!!!!\n\nNow lets get down to the puzzles. Of course this follows the pathway of other puzzle games in that you have to find hidden objects through clever interaction of the environment through different problem solving and clues that you find. Not all of which is immediate intuative and require mutliple and diverging lines of thought to come to the solutions. But this game does it in very unique ways and slowly builds you up with its unique system, so much you don't really notice aside from the increased level of challenges with each new mission.\n\nI don't have any real complaints for this game and will be keeping a close eye on this company for new releases and hopefully part 2 of this game.

Once a puzzle is solved you can go onto the next for a total of 5 missions (as of time of writing). There are collectibles to find as you play that will go into your office. Additionally you can mess around with things in the level.

The mechanics felt pretty well designed, I rarely felt like my failures were the game poorly explaining something or having clunky controls.\n\nThe puzzles were clever and very well presented in the classic spy theme.\n\nThe sound and art design were perfect for the experience.\n\nWhile the game may not be very long or have high replay value I think you'll be presently surprised by the quality of the puzzles this game presents. I would absolutely recommend this experience to VR veterans and newcomers alike. You will have plenty of wonderful VR moments where you toss an object back and forth in your hands, pondering your way out of a sticky situation, only to catch the answer out of the corner of your eye. Very satisfying.\n\nI look forward to seeing what else Schell Games can achieve in the future and hope they create a sequel to this wonderful game.", "timestamp_created": 1514193284, "timestamp_updated": 1514193284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38649989": {"recommendationid": "38649989", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969306898", "num_games_owned": 515, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514267004}, "language": "english", "review": "The intro alone is worth the price of admission.

I for one would like to buy 5 levels for \u00a33-5 depending on quality and complexity and if good enough then I would continue to do so.\n\nFun game for the whole family and as easy as it is comical.", "timestamp_created": 1513154051, "timestamp_updated": 1513154051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474860", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38269216": {"recommendationid": "38269216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035425370", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513126286}, "language": "english", "review": "Very recommended game if you have HTC or oculus", "timestamp_created": 1513125871, "timestamp_updated": 1513125871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38267843": {"recommendationid": "38267843", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118789045", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 131, "last_played": 1515520762}, "language": "english", "review": "A summary of my 2 hours gameplay - Drowned, suffocated, fire explosion, poison, lack of oxigen, grenade....................", "timestamp_created": 1513119749, "timestamp_updated": 1513119749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520036", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38244278": {"recommendationid": "38244278", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995839344", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513716026}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a work of art. \n\nConsidering it is one of the earliest players in the still new VR market, it is even more astonishing, how much it does right.

Become the secret agent you always knew you were.... and let the shenanigans begin! \n\nTLDNR: +Game Mechanics, Graphics, Humor :: - No Room Scale, Too Short\nVERDICT: 10/10 Shenanigans, Buy It!\n\nIf you own VR, I Expect You To Die should be on everyone's list.\n\nVISUALS: The visuals are fantastic. Schell Games did a great job. The environments are clean and has a 70s retro feel to them. And oh man that opening intro\u2026. amazing work.\n\nGAME PLAY: The gameplay mechanics really stand out in this game. The controls are simple and everything just works. The game is made to be played while sitting down but gives you the ability to pick up and control things from a distance. It works great and the transition from in your hand to using something remotely is very smooth.It's very intuitive and easy to use. I would love to see this made for room scale. You can solve the puzzles in various ways and laughs are sure to follow as you attempt to complete them.\n\nSTORY: The story is fairly simple. You are a secret agent trying to stop Zoraxis, a nefarious global weapons and pharmaceutical corporation.  You are sent on various missions in hope that you will finally get that vacation you\u2019ve been waiting for. Solve the puzzles or die trying! I enjoyed the story and gameplay so much I just wish it was longer! The studio did release a new mission \u2026 I mean\u2026 vacation\u2026 level for you to play. Its nice to see the game updated. \n\nREPLAY VALUE: I really wish the game were longer as it is so much fun! Even taking your time you can play through the missions in 2 or 3 hours. There is some replayability as you can complete the missions in various ways. There are also achievements for all you hunters out there. This will become one of my go-to games when I demo the HTC Vive. It is also available on other VR platforms.\n\nCONCLUSION: If you own VR, this game is a solid buy! You will not be disappointed.\n\nI stream live on Twitch. Drop by and say hello sometime! \n\nSirSelrahc\nhttps://twitch.tv/sirselrahc", "timestamp_created": 1513016793, "timestamp_updated": 1513016900, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38235231": {"recommendationid": "38235231", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962826429", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514653737}, "language": "spanish", "review": "(Juego t\u00edpico de scape room)\n\nPues s\u00ed, vais a palmar bastante.

Another reason i love this game so much is because i actually talked to one of the lead developers when they visited my school, they did showcase some things about I Expect You To Die and that made me really hyped for it.

You are a pretty inept spy trying to foil the villains plots but getting killed all the time.  Tons of fun but like almost all the VR games out there this one has the typical drawbacks.\n\nPros:\nThe intro is so well done you actually sit through it multiple times.\nThe premise and story is a great idea.\nThe controls are pretty simple and rather intuitive.\nYou can play from a seated position because of your \"Telekinesis Implants\" (which i would like to say is a great way of making the game seated compatible).\nLots of reasons to go back and try for completeness and getting all the items for your office.\n\nCons:\nAgain with VR games it is very short.  You can \"beat\" the game in maybe an hour or two.\nWant all the items in the office it will take longer\nI (obviously) have the steam version playing it with a Rift so I have to reset my seated position regularly and view but I assume that isn't typical for others and doesn't deter from the enjoyment of the game.\nPuzzles can be hard and repetitive with little clues to go on.  You may have to die several times to get the mission right.\n\nOverall this is a must buy for anyone with VR.

You assume the role of a bond-style secret agent who has to solve puzzles under pressure. I won't spoil too much but the gist of the game is you are dropped into an area (like a secret base or special vehicle) and given a simple task. However this simple task requires you to complete several other tasks, often times under the threat of death if you fail, which ramps up into quite a tense and addictive puzzle game. Its got a cartoon art style that is very detailed and works great in VR and the game just oozes charm at every turn. \n\nOne of this game's best features I think is the inclusion of Telekenitc powers. What this basically allows you to do is pick up objects that aren't necessarily within arms reach and move them closer or farther from you. This allows you to grab items from across the room without moving but has the added benefit that if you encounter any controller tracking issues or have a small play space you can use these powers to retrieve the item. For example, if you don't have a large play space you don't have to worry about reaching too far and bumping something, you can just pull it towards you. \n\nThe only downside to this game is the amount of content. Not including the bond-style opening movie and brief tutorial there are only four missions. Each of these missions are unique and can be quite hard to complete but are the same every time. Thus, after you finish them all, you're basically out of stuff to do. Being puzzles have the fun is figuring it out the first time. Once you know the answer its a lot less exciting. It seems to be a common for VR games to lack content. Fortunately  there is new content in the works!\n\nThe game is super fun and oozes charm.

The ear piece narrator does a great job of acknowledging when you try a fun combination, even when it doesn't get you closer to the goal. Each level also has a set of special objectives for completionists that hint at wacky combinations you missed.\n\nMany times you're just picking apart a familiar environment where the real world logic applied (in a car you check the glove box, the arm rest, the sun visor, roll down the windows, etc.). But there's just enough Roger-Moore-era spy goofiness to catch you off guard or surprise you with a joke.\n\nWhile the dialog is pretty clever the delivery is just a tad off, sounds like someone doing an impression of M mixed with Q rather than a genuine curmudgeon Brit.

Come on, admit it, you did the same. So imagine how cool it would be if you could have one that fired for real, have real enemies to shoot at and most importantly you could get away with playing with it age 38 lol. Well, Spartaga is damn close to that, you have the shooting and the flying but you also have an almost puzzle element to the game due to the way the laser works (shoot 4 of the same type of enemy) and the scoring system which rewards combos.  \nOne of the cool things about the game is the different modes, each level can be played normally or one of a multiple of other modes. Including a peaceful mode where you can not shoot but, the enemies spawn with a lifespan that even mayflies would say \u201cDamn that's a short life\u201d, just dodge them as the frantically try to kill you before their number is up. \nOnce you reach Level 8 and face your first boss you unlock a marathon mode (think survival, one life last as long as you can!).\nIf that is not enough variety for you, there is also the ability to level up your special weapons (of which there is a fair few to choose from) and change your skins with a complete experience and level system. \n\n[b]ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENT / GRAPHICS[/b]\nThe main area of the game is a large water plane with particle effects in the distant, planets and stars. It is simplistic and yet beautiful, I love it. But most of the time your attention will be focused on the large array of enemies (that get added to with each level) that are trying to shoot or ram into you.  \nThe enemies have a decidedly retro look and feel which goes well with the game\u2019s sound effects and soundtrack. The soundtracks can be switched between fast beated arcade-style music or some rather relaxing tunes by a band I had never heard of called Carbon Based Lifeforms, the latter is what I mostly opted for, again it works well with the game. \n\n[b]PERFORMANCE[/b] \nThe whole area can be filled with balls of purple energy, white tracer fire of shots, red scatter particles, purple chaser ships and large yellow lasers, and yet it runs smooth as pie. This is a very smooth and well-optimized game.\n\n[b]INTUITIVENESS[/b] \nThe first level serves as a tutorial and will quickly teach you the basics of the game, and you soon learn the power of the 4. What do I mean by the power of the 4? Well when you hit 4 of the same enemy without killing another type you get a laser, 4 more keeps it going and this is where the power of the 4 and the almost puzzle-like part of the game comes in. \n\n[b]MULTIPLAYER:[/b] \nNot multiplayer per say but it does have leaderboards, those little lists that encourage the one more try. \n\n[b]PROS:[/b] \n[list]\n[*] Well designed atmosphere, from the game area to the enemy design.\n[*] There is that \u201cone more try\u201d feel.\n[*] The enemies are added at a pace that allows you to learn each one and keeps the levels fresh.\n[*] Fun boss fights (though you will die the first time you try one...guarantee it lol)\n[*] Choice of two soundtracks both pretty cool.\n[*] Great scoring system which makes you actually think how to approach the enemies and encourages you to not just blindly shoot everything.\n[*] multiple game modes to mix it up and add variety.\n[*] Get to play with a spaceship 38 with almost no judgement (making plane noises and going pew pew can cause mild judgement from your cat...may be just my cat though)\n[*] Can be played with one pad (great if you need to charge one or if you only have one)\n[*] A developer that cares about their game (After my first try video I had a ton of feedback about the tutorial and some other bits and pieces, the developer heard this keenly and pretty soon the game was patched. This is a developer that listens to his users and cares about his game)\n[/list]\n\n[b]CONS:[/b] \n[list]\n[*] At times it can be a little too hard.

Spartaga is a neat arcade game of the bullet hell genre, a nice change from first person shooters. The combo system adds another layer of gameplay that really makes it interesting and engaging, especially when you're trying to shoot a specific enemy while dodging the lasers, bullets, and chasers. It definitely keeps you moving around and reacting to enemies.\nThe enemies are easily recognizable by their colors and shapes, and so are the projectiles, making it so that you know what went wrong.  What goes on in the background also fills the atmosphere nicely as you're listening to the music. The ability to change how your ship, your shots, and the background looks is also great, but it's lacking variety unlike the enemies. \nThe 27 enemies really do feel like they're all different from each other, unlike some other VR games where enemies are just reskins of each other. Shooters,shotgunners, chasers,bombs(sorta), lasers, turrets, tanks,etc., all make the levels quite a lot more exciting.\nI haven't tried the marathon yet, but I really love the game(heck yeah 20+ hours and counting). Somewhat of a completionist, I try to complete the challenges(speedy,pacifist, and elite) that the game provides, and I don't find it repetitive.

The main difference being that most games try to trick you into thinking you're in the world of the game. I didn't get that at all from this game, however, that was by no means a bad thing. It's just a totally different kind of game, where VR is instead utilized to give you a different experience when playing a 3d \"space invaders\"/\"bullet gallery\" type game.

That being said, the leaderboards and scoring and combo powerup system compliment this style of gameplay wonderfully. You'll soon realize there's far more than simply dodging the incoming shower of lasers looking for an opportunity to shoot back. As you plan an attack strategy you need to take into account how many shots on which target will build up your combo meter fastest to upgrade your weapons giving you the best chance of defending yourself.\n\nVisuals:\nThe graphics aesthetic speaks to a retro futurism pastiche of Tron meets Battlezone in Space. Combat can get pretty massive and evokes the epic feeling of Gundam space battles with a Geometry Wars focal point. Most of the backgrounds, while immersive enough will be just that, as attention will definitely be the battle action happening front and center. These graphics aren't going to blow anyone away but they work well with the style of game.\n\nSound Design:\nAt times it felt like conducting as you weave between the enemies and execute your symphony of destruction... a few quick shots here, a long beam fired there, try not to rush through the red alert of incoming seeker ships. This game goes far beyond classic Shoot'em Ups with an abstraction of elements that would feel at place in a rhythm game. And this is aided by an excellent combination of spacey ambient tunes that really fit the flow of gameplay with its varied SFX of enemies encroaching, lasers firing and explosions all around you. It might be relaxing once you get past the chaos and threat of imminent death.\n\nOne criticism:\nThe ship you control doesn't move necessarily in smooth and sweeping motions like all the enemy ships around it. This is obviously connected to input from the controller eg your hand motion. And I get the need to be able to move quickly to dodge incoming shots, but the immersion is reduced when your avatar acts less like a space ship and more like a gnat buzzing about.\n\nFinal thoughts: \nWhile there are some improvements that can still be made and the game style will not appeal to everyone; this is an exhilarating VR experience that will keep you coming back to enjoy the variety this game has to offer.", "timestamp_created": 1503935709, "timestamp_updated": 1503935709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525316", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 32, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 32}}

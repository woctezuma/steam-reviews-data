As\u00ed que, si ya eres fan de la serie, existen varias razones por las que este juego puede convencerte para jugarlo durante muchas horas, sin importar que tanto te hayan gustado o disustado los juegos anteriores.\n\nEn el aspecto superficial el juego hace bien su trabajo, los gr\u00e1ficos son bastante buenos y el dise\u00f1o tanto de personajes (sobretodo en las nuevas formas que desarrollan los personajes principales) as\u00ed como de los dungeons (haciendo un especial \u00e9nfasis en los dungeons de la primera parte del juego), es bastante creativo y, al mismo tiempo, estilizado.\n\nHablando ya en un aspecto m\u00e1s profundo, el juego reinventa algunas mec\u00e1nicas ya utilizadas anteriormente y juntando eso con el hecho de que el balanceo de estad\u00edsticas es bastante bueno (ej. Un enemigo con mucha defensa f\u00edsica ser\u00e1 casi inmune ante un personaje que lo ataque as\u00ed, a menos que est\u00e9 sea unos 20 niveles superior) hacen que el juego sea desafiante si no tienes la estrategia adecuada de acercamiento al enemigo o los suficiente \u00edtems de apoyo para sobrevivir lo suficiente.\n\nUna de las mec\u00e1nicas m\u00e1s importantes en el juego es el sistema de scouts, un reemplazo del Remake System, con el cual consigues nuevos dungeons, \u00edtems, dinero o enemigos, al hacer que unos personajes, llamados scouts, exploren dungeons durante un tiempo predeterminado. Adem\u00e1s, mientras no hagas que el scout reporte sus descubrimientos, el dungeon que lo tenga tendr\u00e1 ciertas caracter\u00edsticas, las cuales ya est\u00e1n determinadas en cada scout, que pueden tanto ayudar como empeorar el desempe\u00f1o del jugador en el dungeon (+10% de experiencia, -10% de ganancia de oro, etc.). Esto permite que dependiendo como nuevas tus scouts puedas duplicar tu velocidad de farmear o de ganancia de oro dependiendo de tu estilo de juego.\n\nOtra elemento importante es el hecho de que al subir de nivel o al salir del dungeon ya no recuperas tu vida y man\u00e1, esto hace que si quieres luchar en dungeons de nivel superior tengan un elemento de riesgo m\u00e1s alto, pues puedes perder tus 2 horas de farmear continuo si no est\u00e1s atento a tus recursos y a tus personajes, que animado con el balanceo ya antes explicado hacen que un dungeon de solo 5 niveles superior sea m\u00e1s complicado de lo que era en los juegos anteriores. En especial cuando, debido a la historia, est\u00e1s forzado a luchar solo en en un equipo de 2 sin alguien especializado en cuaraciones.\n\nSin embargo el cambio m\u00e1s grande que se puede notar entre los juegos anteriores y este es, obviamente, el sistema de combate, el cual sufri\u00f3 una necesaria evoluci\u00f3n comparado con el anterior. Para ser simple, ahora ya no existen los Guard Points en los enemigos, sino que para causar el da\u00f1o m\u00e1s grande ocupas encadenar golpes los cuales permitan al siguiente golpe ser m\u00e1s poderoso, al cumplir la condici\u00f3n que est\u00e9 necesita para hacerlo (ej. Realiza solo ataques de tipo rush, No utilices ataque de tipo Standard, etc.). Lo importante es que el n\u00famero de combos que puedes realizar se viene limitado debido al arma, pues cada arma solo permite que cierto n\u00famero de ataques sean realizados (ej. 3 Rush, 1 Power, 4 Standard) y dependiendo de los ataques que tengas disponibles ciertas armas no convendr\u00e1n, a\u00fan as\u00ed esa es la libertad que genera este sistema de combate, pues cada quien tiene sus formas de pelear y a diferencia del otro sistema basado en Puntos y ataques, existe m\u00e1s de un camino de eficiencia.\n\nEn t\u00e9rminos de historia, esta se presenta en tres actos, y cada una tiene un enfoque que no solo hace variada la historia en todo el juego, pues no s\u00e9 siente como peque\u00f1os eventos que eventualmente se convertir\u00e1n en algo grande, como en los otros juegos, sino como grandes eventos los cuales tendr\u00e1n su final de forma bastante gigantesca, pues con tantos personajes e ideas entre actos se profundiza en el mundo de una forma que solo hab\u00eda sido explorada en Sisters Generation, y a\u00fan as\u00ed el sentido del humor hace que no se sienta pesada, sino que adem\u00e1s logra una gran empat\u00eda con los nuevos personajes, que apesar de ser humoristicos tienen ese toque de humanidad y alegr\u00eda que en verdad sientes que quieres estar con ellos para apoyarlos.\n\nConcluyendo, este juego es lo que los fans necesitaban en el momento indicado, pues refresc\u00f3 las ideas que en su momento Rebirth hab\u00eda desarrollado, y creo un nuevo est\u00e1ndar en cuanto a c\u00f3mo debe ser un juego de Neptunia, siendo desafiante, pero al mismo tiempo entretenido, creando una historia cuya madurez se hace notar en los momentos necesarios, sin necesidad de ser pretenciosa en ning\u00fan momento y con un gran sentido del humor.

The quirkyness, the overall theme and plot were among the most interesting to me at the time. But... We're not here to talk about the entire franchise.\n\nWhat can I say about Megadimension Neptunia VII? It's enjoyable, it's lengthy, it can be challenging at points. It has everything you need for a good JRPG. The combat system isn't the greatest, as sometimes it seems a bit rigged. For example, enemies will target a very specific character from your party, even though it seems like the opposite would be logical. Sometimes certain characters and/or enemies will gain extra turns for seemingly no reason. It's not perfect, but it's enjoyable at the least.\n\nThe story - or rather, storieS - are what sold this game for me. There's always a twist around every corner, for example [spoiler] when Gold Third takes over, or when Uzume turns out to be evil but not really because it's really just a doppelganger (Kurome) [/spoiler]. And when you least expect it, there's always a boss battle. \n\nSpeaking of bosses, I heavily enjoy the new Parts system. If an enemy has certain defensive parts, you can perform a Parts Break on them. That is, attacking said parts enough to the point where they will shatter, leaving the enemy vulnerable. The only area I found this mechanic to be an issue is during [spoiler] the battle with Affimojas [/spoiler]. It felt like it was put in to create a false sense of difficulty - [spoiler] having to break many parts just to be able to get a single hit in wasn't very enjoyable [/spoiler].\n\nThe quests system has stayed the same throughout the franchise, giving the players optional side-quests to perform for Shares, extra items, EXP, etc. It's useful if you want to grind the game to hell, I suppose.\n\nSpeaking of grinding, I found this installment to be far less grindy than previous ones. I only had to go grinding for one or two levels per character every now and then, which is extremely welcome for someone like me who hates the idea of grinding for hours on end.\n\nThe route system. Sometimes the route system felt like an unnecessary nuisance to pad the game for length at certain points [spoiler] for example, the part where you're forced to go from city to city picking up all the members of Gold Third, but being stopped every now and then for pointless battles [/spoiler].\n\nNow on to probably the best part about the game: The soundtrack. God damn, I LOVE Neptunia's soundtrack. Kenji Kaneko and all the other composers did an excellent job in making music for these games, and I applaud them a million times over. My favourite track out of this game would probably have to be \"Absolute.\"\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game. I feel like I got my money's worth, given the 50+ hour length and the sheer amount of content within. The story was great, the gameplay was solid. I have few bad things to say about this game.\n\nPros and Cons time, folks!\n\nPros:\n-Great story.\n-Fucking amazing soundtrack.\n-Great mechanics.\n-Great combat system.\n-Minimal grinding (At least for me).\n-It's Neptunia. What more could you want?\n\nCons:\n-Combat seemed to be rigged at points.\n-Route system seemed unnecessary.\n-Enemies and Characters alike seemed to gain extra turns for no reason.\n\nAll in all, this game is great. I highly recommend it to any Neptunia fan, or for anyone who enjoys a good JRPG.\n\nI give Megadimension Neptunia VII a 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1513369601, "timestamp_updated": 1514609666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38317796": {"recommendationid": "38317796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272858105", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513411945}, "language": "english", "review": "I've only played it for about an hour, but I can say that this is a really good game.

Au\u00dferdem gibt es Extraloot.\n\nFormationangriffe, bei denen die ausf\u00fchrenden Charaktere das oder die Ziele flankiert oder umzingelt haben m\u00fcssen, sind ebenfalls neu und sind vorallem dann n\u00fctzlich, wenn es darum geht, alle vom Gegner getragenen Ausr\u00fcstungsgegenst\u00e4nde anzugreifen. \n\nEine weitere Neuerung ist die EXE-DRIVE-Leiste, die nicht wie in den Vorg\u00e4ngern noch f\u00fcr jeden Charakter separat zur Verf\u00fcgung steht, sondern f\u00fcr die ganze Gruppe.\n\nInsgesamt machen die Neuerungen im Kampfsystem keinen allzu gro\u00dfen Unterschied bis auf einige Ausnahmen, da die Gegner oft schon in den Seilen h\u00e4ngen, bevor ihre Ausr\u00fcstung zerbricht.\n\nEine neue Art des Kampfes sind die Gigantenk\u00e4mpfe, in denen man sich \u00fcber das Schlachtfeld bewegt, indem man von einer schwebenden Plattform zur anderen springt. Hier stehen Combos und einige Spezialangriffe nicht zur Verf\u00fcgung, daf\u00fcr regeneriert man jede Runde einige Spezialpunkte. Generell habe ich diese K\u00e4mpfe fast nie als sonderlich anspruchsvoll empfunden, aber die Idee ist nett.\n\nIn diesem Teil haben die Entwickler versucht, Gameplayelemente auf der Weltkarte und den Dungeons einzuf\u00fcgen, um sie besser zu machen. Mit relativ \u00fcberschaubarem Erfolg, sofern man Backtracking und Randomencounter auf der Weltkarte als st\u00f6rend empfindet. Backtracking, weil man so ziemlich alle Dungeons sp\u00e4ter noch ein Mal besuchen muss, wenn man sich alle Sch\u00e4tze holen will, da man sp\u00e4ter die F\u00e4higkeiten erlangt, Hindernisse aus dem Weg zu r\u00e4umen oder h\u00f6her zu springen und Randomencounter erscheinen auf der Weltkarte im schnitt alle paar Schritte (man muss jetzt von jeder Location zur anderen laufen, anstelle wie in den Vorg\u00e4ngern einfach via schnellreise hin zu gelangen und die Vernetzung der Wege k\u00f6nnte besser sein. Hier wurde eindeutig Spielzeitstreckung betrieben, was ich als Fan der Reihe ziemlich schade finde. \n\nWas ebenfalls einigen \u00c4nderungen zum Opfer gefallen ist, ist die Itementwicklung. Diese ist zwar immernoch vorhanden, allerdings nicht mehr in der Weise, dass man wie im Vorg\u00e4nger Baupl\u00e4ne finden muss (bis auf einige Ausnahmen). Die meisten Entwicklungen schaltet man frei, indem man in den einzelnen Ortschaften in Forschung etc investiert, also Geld rein steckt. Ich kam zwar ganz gut zurecht, ohne fr\u00fch im Spiel gro\u00df was investieren zu m\u00fcssen, aber unn\u00f6tig finde ich das Feature trotzdem.\n\nEin gutes Feature ist, wie ich finde, das Scoutsystem, in dem man Scouts in die einzelnen Dungeons schickt, wo sie durch ihre Entdeckungen verbesserungen f\u00fcr den Dungeon wie neue Gegner, neue Dungeons oder neue Scouts freischalten.\nZus\u00e4tzlich geben Scouts dem Spieler, sofern er sich im Dungeon befindet, einige Boni wie Erfahrungsbonus oder h\u00f6here Chancen, dass Gegner Items fallen lassen.\n\nPositiv erw\u00e4hnen m\u00fcsste man noch, dass das Spiel insgesammt weniger grindlastig ist, als die Vorg\u00e4nger (mit Ausnahme eines Kampfes im dritten Kapitel, aber da war die Arena schon verf\u00fcgbar) zumindest habe ich es so empfunden.\n\n[h1]Grafik, Soundtrack[/h1]\nDie Grafik k\u00f6nnte auf leistungsschw\u00e4cheren Ger\u00e4ten Probleme machen (vorallem die Schattendarstellung) kann aber in den Optionen relativ frei ver\u00e4ndert werden, so dass auch alte Ger\u00e4te damit zurecht kommen. Zu erw\u00e4hnen w\u00e4hre, dass die meisten Charaktere neue Butshots bekommen haben, die wie ich finde, sehr gut aussehen.\nDer Soundtrack ist mit dem der Vorg\u00e4nger nicht mehr zu vergleichen. Es sind einige gesungene St\u00fccke dabei, die ziemlich gut klingen. Einige St\u00fccke aus den Vorg\u00e4ngern haben mir besser gefallen, aber naja~\n\n[h1]Zusammenfassung[/h1]\n[b]Pro[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]\u00dcberarbeitetes KS mit interessanten Features wie zerst\u00f6rbarer Bewaffnung der Gegner\n    [*]Gigantenbossk\u00e4mpfe, die sich von normalen K\u00e4mpfen grundlegend unterscheiden\n    [*]Einige beliebte Features aus den Vorg\u00e4ngern wie Itementwicklung\n    [*]Scoutsystem, um Items, Geld, neue Gegner oder Scouts zu finden\n[/list]\n\n[b]Neutral[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Teils komplett neue Charaktere (MarvelousAQL, Tekken, Red und Co sind nicht mehr dabei)\n    [*]Gruppe Teilt sich eine Driveleiste ansatt dass wie in den Vorg\u00e4ngern jeder eine eigene hat\n[/list]\n\n[b]Kontra[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Einige Features redundant oder seltsam umgesetzt\n    [*]Randomencounter auf der Weltkarte\n    [*]einiges wirkt spielzeitstreckend und nervt\n[/list]\n\n[b]Fazit[/b]\nMegadimension Neptunia VII macht vieles anders als die Vorg\u00e4nger, einiges besser und manches falsch (finde ich)\nDie Handlung ist ein wenig besser als die der anderen Spiele wie ich finde, gewinnt aber trotzdem noch keinen Oscar und das Spiel wird wieder in erster Linie von den Charakteren getragen. Wenn man ein heiteres, farbenfrohes J-RPG mit lockerer Atmosphere (und einigem Fanservice) sucht, kann man zugreifen. Wer hingegen ein Spiel mit minuti\u00f6s ausgefeiltem Gameplay, tiefsinniger Handlung und facettnreichen Charakteren sucht, sollte weiter suchen.\nWer die Vorg\u00e4nger mochte, muss dieses Spiel nicht unbedingt auch m\u00f6gen, gerade weil es so anders ist als die anderen Teile, aber ich hatte meinen Spa\u00df und gebe daher eine Kaufempfehlung.", "timestamp_created": 1512935210,

Eine neue Engine hat f\u00fcr bessere 3D-Modelle, sowie Animationen gesorgt. Auch die Spezialattacken und Verwandlungsszenen sind h\u00fcbsch anzusehen.\n\nDas Spiel kann wahlweise mit Japanischem oder Englischen Dub gespielt werden, wobei hier die Japanische Syncrofassung empfehlenswerter ist als die Englische. Die japanischen Stimmen sind meiner Meinung nach nicht nur f\u00fcr die Charaktere passender, sondern werden auch noch durch Gr\u00f6\u00dfen wie beispielsweise Yui Horie und Asami Imai synchronisiert. \n\nSeit dem zweiten Teil der Reihe, welcher damals auf der PS3 erschien, besitzen alle Neptuniaspiele der Hauptreihe ein rundenbasiertes Kampfsystem mit Bewegungselementen. Hier ist nichts bahnbrechendes neues zu erwarten. Spielerisch ist das Spiel nicht zu anspruchsvoll und kann auch gut mal zwischendurch gespielt werden. Zwar ist es m\u00f6glich das Spiel mit der Tastatur zu spielen, jedoch finde ich als Veteran der PS3-Spiele einen Controller hier angenehmer, dies mag f\u00fcr Leute, die mit den auf Steam erschienen Remakes mit der Reihe angefangen haben, jedoch anders sein.\n\nErz\u00e4hlerisch ist hier kein Meisterwerk zu erwarten, da das Spiel mehr auf die ungew\u00f6hnlichen Charaktere und ihre jeweiligen Macken setzt, als auf die Story. Weiterhin wird das Geschehen oftmals von den Charakteren kommentiert, wobei hier oftmals die 4te Wand gebrochen wird.\n\nInsgesamt ist Megadimension Neptunia VII eine Empfehlung f\u00fcr Fans von JRPGs aller \"Tales of\" oder den vorherigen Teilen der Nepuniareihe.", "timestamp_created": 1511706985, "timestamp_updated": 1511706985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37673521": {"recommendationid": "37673521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074429479", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 678, "last_played": 1514559232}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u9e21\u9e2d\u6bcf\u56de\u5408\u90fd\u6389\u8840\u5462\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1511705543, "timestamp_updated": 1511705543, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37670999": {"recommendationid": "37670999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096124820", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479560265}, "language": "english", "review": "can't afford a PS4? play it on PC then :).

All the dialogue is also well thought out and amazingly voiced, although there could be a full dub I really can't ask for more. The only down sides to this game is the Dungeon Exploration and Some Reused Assets. The game does not work well with keyboard controls due to it being a consle port, so a controller is fully recommended.

The story line was getting better and better as I progressed. The cutscenes were enjoyable to watch and voice acting was superb, especially 4th wall breaks and comedy. It indeed is a very fun game and I love the Megadimension Neptunia series. Unfortunately, it turned out to be really bad (at least for pc). Why you may ask?\n\nPoorly developed for PC: There are still incredible lag issues. The devs didn't really optimize it properly for PC. When you go wandering around (most of the lag issues stem from here) or in battle, that's when it happens. FPS drops to around 10-15. Another thing to note is that all the controls are based on the PS4 controls when playing on PC. The devs didn't even properly explain the PC controls, even if you go to the controls optimization menu or read the manual or PDF. You basically have to jumble your fingers around the keyboard as you struggle to find the correct controls. It was very difficult to search the controls to find the correct buttons. Plus it demands the most expensive upgrades to your PC to play it.\n\nRidiculous price: The rest of the Megadimension series is priced at $30 and this one is priced at $40. Even when the entire series goes on sale at a reasonable price, this episode is still ridiculously fahking expensive at $14. It just isn't sensible for such a good series. I get the PS4 price and it\u2019s legit for the PS4 version but not for PC.\n\nDevs not listening: The devs don't really take the time to listen to concerns. Valvo, 2K, Firaxis, Psyonix and other game devs of similar strategy and turn-based games actually take the time to listen to concerns and address them. IF Int'l doesn't really communicate effectively and that's why some issues haven't been fixed. \n\nLack of effective updates: When was the last effective update for this game? Over a fahking year ago when it initially came out. One year later, they left Uzume to disappear with Zero dimension. \n\nGame engine: No one knows the unfamiliar game engine. Rather it would have been better to use Unreal or Source engine which are much more user friendly.\n\nOversexualization: Some characters are somewhat oversexualized. Cases of bouncing b**bs (particularly Vert's for example) and whatever, I mean I understand that could be typical of anime, but it goes a little too far. It happens way too much and should be cut down somewhat.\n\nThis game is really fun, fellow denizens of Zero Dimension, and I would recommend it all the way ONLY if you buy on PS4, not PC unless your PC supports the game smoothly.\n\nTL;DR: Works poorly for PC, and the devs need to improve a lot on that said platform. ONLY buy on PS4 or get something else for a strategy game like [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/200510] XCOM: Enemy Unknown [/url].\n\nRefunded it. Review will stay negative until the devs get their fahking neps out their fahking arses for the PC version.", "timestamp_created": 1511403382, "timestamp_updated": 1512744577, "voted_up": false,

I got to admit, this game is brilliant for both people who are new and experienced with the Hyperdimension Neptunia series. It'll probably provide you upwards of 50 hours of unadulterated gameplay and story through it's unique trilogy based structure with 2(3) seperate endings and Visual Novel styled story telling.\n\nThe enemies aren't all that difficult most of the time, but the bosses make up for that. On my first playthrough many bosses I only survived by the skin of my teeth. The post-game content and DLC (Which isn't needed at all to enjoy the game) provides quite a bit of gameplay for anyone looking to get the most out of the game.\n\nMany dungeons, enemies, backgrounds/assets, etc are commonly reused with minor modifications, especially in post game content or further into the story. (This is common in JRPGs)\n\nI personally enjoyed the story and would recommend it to anyone who wants a darker more serious theme from the Neptunia series. The comedic moments were abundant and well placed. (I'll admit, I smiled more than I should've), the story wasn't too predictable and the self-aware nature (Like the rest of the Neptunia series) that many games with bad stories try to use as a coverup was actually executed well and bought everything together. It's definitely a step up from other Neptunia games.\n\nThe fan service ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) is less frequent but still strongly present in the game in some scenes (As expected of a Hyperdimension game) if you like fan service you'll be rewarded quite well in the \"True Ending\"! (Which I only reccomend doing on your 2nd run of the game!)\n\nThe combat system is interesting, the skills and the combo attacks aren't always scaled together correctly, and DLC weapons almost \"break\" the game at some points (Which is your choice to buy and enable anyway). Apart from this I'd say its pretty good for a turned based combat system. The skill animations are interesting, comedic and full of energy until you end up skipping all of them the 10th time you've seen them but you always end up taking a peek every so often especially on that last finishing blow.\n\nOverall, if you're a Neptunia fan why haven't you bought this yet, seriously? If you've played other JRPGs and Visual novels before I'd also reccomend this, it has it all. If you're new to eastern games you might be put off by the hyperbolic nature (anime), post-game grinding and fan-service :^).", "timestamp_created": 1511124908, "timestamp_updated": 1511699528,

to try to get it to run properly, I have finally given up.  I love this series and have played through to near 100% completion Rebirth 1 2 and 3, and for what I got to experience I really enjoed in this game.  I absolutely cannot recommend this pc port to anyone however because it is an extremely poor port.  Every computer I tried it on, ranging from dual core processor with GTX970M to a quad core processor with a GTX1070, has had stuttering and lag issues that make the game extremely offputting to play.  From what people in the forums have been reporting for over a year, is the way the game loads sound files is extremly broken and has never been fixed, controller support has basically been given up on for the Xbox One controller.  last update about the controller was July 2016, where even their solution had you remap the triggers if things were still working incorrectly, hit or miss if things happen to work properly for you but for me even chosing the controller is an issue as the game tries to switch back to the mouse after half a second.  I was forced to switch back to the mouse and keyboard to beat the first mega boss, as the game will not recognize holding any button for longer than half a second before dropping the input, making it impossible for me to enter HDD state (later figured out that you can either hold the input for a full second OR double press the input)\n\nIn the end I like the game but it is bugged to the point of being unplayable for me on pc, if you like the series and want another game in the series that slightly mixes up combat from the ReBirth games: GET IT ON THE PS4 AND AVOID THIS AWFUL PORT\nIf you have never played a Hyperdimension Neptunia game, I suggest giving this an attempt, but immediately ask for a refund if you have any stuttering issues because nothing you do on your end can fix the port itself being bad.\n\nedit 11/6 - No, installing it on an SSD did not fix it idiot who downvoted me and claimed it would, do you really think in 20 hours of fiddling with installations and settings that I WOULDN'T F'ING TRY THAT?

You know this series is stupid. Let's shake hands, and have some fun with this game series about anime console wars, with the game in the (main) series that (so far) is the most polished.\n\nmegadimension neptunia v-ii[/h1] \n\nLet's cut to the chase. There's no reason to make a review for this. The game's fucking dumb and you'll know if you'll love it or hate it instantly. The gameplay is the same as always, albiet with much, MUCH less grinding (thank fucking god) and the story is filled to the brim with meta and hilarious dialogue. The story's probably the best in the series, though that's not saying much, and elaborating would be dumb cause this is a dumb game with a dumb story. So what makes this one the best game?\n\n[h1]it's much more polished [/h1]\n\nThis game was originally released on the PS4 as opposed to the Vita Re;Birth series, and it really shows. The models are nicer, the UI cleaner, the framerates smoother, the animations crisper, everything just looks and feels better. The sound design's a very notable example of this: weapons hit with just enough of an edge to feel fucking glorious and the soundtrack's got some pretty great tunes that go beyond the \"fantasy with electronic\" tunes of the original series.\n\nI do miss the pixel Nep in the world map. Ugh. I hate the new world map. Yeah, the segments look nicer and the map flows together much better, but you're always running into an enemy that takes up way too much of your time and having to run across the entire world just to activate a small bit of dialogue. Huh, wha-? Oh right, a review.\n\n[h1]and there's some small but notable gameplay differences[/h1]\n\nThey're really, really small. They do make a pretty damn big difference, though. The game's been turned into somewhat more of a strategy game- weapons have their own combo slot now and combos their own crits activated by certain criteria, so there's no more just hitting away at enemies with the latest weapon you grab- you have to think about if the extra damage would outweigh the advantages of the current combo setup, and if your new combo setup would be better, and if you'd be better off with the rush attacks instead of the power, and-where am I going with this?\n\nThe EXE gauge has been heavily nerfed. That thing was basically a \"im bored kill it now just lets get it over with\" button. Neat. Luckily, the gauge fills up much faster, so that's nice. Also, some of the EXE skills involve having the characters arrange themselves in a certain formation, so there's a bit of planning on \"should i move my character there and risk being targeted and hit by an attack so i can use this skill\" or some nonsense like that...I don't really know what to say. This review's pointless. Let's just skip to the conclusion.\n\n[h1] so basically [/h1]\n\nYeah, let's just skip to here. You know exactly what this will be. If you like Nep Nep, you'll love this game. Don't like Nep Nep? You'll hate this game. People call this one the best one, and to an extent, I agree. (Still adamant on Re;Birth 3 being the best.) But, we all know this series is fucking dumb. Let's shake hands, and put those flaws aside to enjoy one of the most gloriously stupid fucking game series of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1508271794, "timestamp_updated": 1508271794, "voted_up":

This time, it was a really nice eulogy for Sega as a console maker and the Dreamcast specifically.\n\nThe game uses the usual fighting system and adds a few things on top (Next forms, parts breaking, combat traits) without being too loaded. Outside battle, you still have a lot to do in the cities, shops, with the scouts, the dungeons and the world map. The story is slightly better this time around, the humour also seems to be improved. I really liked the OST, although they reused many tracks. The Japanese voice acting is excellent. Graphics are fine, too - nothing too fancy, but solid for this kind of colorful JRPG.\n\nOn the downside, the itemization pacing seems a bit off. You lose access to the investment option for a good amount of your game, but it is vital for improvements and even a key item. A rand around a lot with the same weapons and processors to suddenly drowns in dozens of new ones when the game opened up again. Accessories and clothes still don't have stats (for a few exceptions). But this is just a small criticism here.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed playing this game a lot. Probably even more than any of the predecessors. If you like round-based JRPGs, meta humour (especially regarding videogames, character stereotypes and storytelling) and can stand the occasional fan service (nothing too revealing, they also poke fun at themselves for that, too), this might be you game. If you didn't like the series before, however, this game probably won't change that.", "timestamp_created": 1506296945, "timestamp_updated": 1506296945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35178250": {"recommendationid": "35178250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123391007", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 4611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510335182}, "language": "norwegian", "review": "Finally got to play this, and boi!

All the characters are their usual quirky selves.  The 4th wall gets shattered, and rebuilt for the sole purpose of shattering it again.  There's a ton of meta references.  And the new characters are cool, especially Uzume (no she didn't slip me any credits to say that).  Basically, everything you enjoy from previous titles.\n\nThere were a few small changes made: some good and some bad.  I liked that they tied the weapons to their own combos, and combo traits to ensure crits, because it causes you to think about what style works best for you and realize not every new weapon is necesarily better for you.  I enjoy the strategy part of a game, and this added to it.  Not just picking out the newest weapon because this time it may not be better for you.\n\nThe investment system was fine although forgettable and I didnt really find a need to develop items much at all.\n\nDifficulty-wise, it's usually not difficult (except optional dungeons), but there were some situations in the main dungeons where if you fought a certain enemy it was pretty much a game over, and every enemy will actively chase you and outrun you.  Wasn't too thrilled about that.  I don't mind difficulty, but some consistency would have been nice.\n\nThe new share system was a mixed bag for me.  Shares going down from being attacked did not make sense to me because taking damage in RPGs is a given and should not be penalized.  You could also game the system through scouts and investment, but at least it would negate the damage issue.\n\nScouts seems like a mixed bag.  They are both necessary and not.  They help you find new dungeons, items, and enemies, which can help you unlock quests, but the luck dependency can make this a chore, and makes quest hunting less prevalent than previous games.  Better than the Stella dungeons though, in my opinion.\n\nMy biggest issue though is the route building, which was pointless, but also having to traverse the entire world over and over again, instead of  teleporting.  I HATED going to Lowee and then back to Planeptune all the time, because you would get randomly jumped by usually very weak enemies, like Dogoos, leading to very pointless fights that should not even be there, sometimes a dozen times per trip.  And then I had one time when I got jumped by a enemy so powerful it one-shotted my entire party, leading to a very frustrating game over.  Really wish that system goes out or gets an overhaul.\n\nStill though, very very enjoyable and I'm glad I spent 50+ hours on this.", "timestamp_created": 1505925057, "timestamp_updated": 1505925057,

There aren't many types of monsters either.\n\nI can't fault a game for being like a console RPG, but I can fault many console RPGs for being power-creep-driven grindfests that lack genuine challenges or choice in party ability/class makeup which would keep our attention.

Is predictable and your typical save the world thing, but the focus isn't in the story but in the characters,  the situations they find themselves in and the humour/jokes.\n-The homour and joke can be hit or miss, some fun moments were great but I found most of them to be predictable and forced.\n+The Battle system is interesting as it forces the player to think in order to link different attacks so you can give extra damage.\n-The characters are your typical anime stereotypes, nothing really unique. I find it hard to point a character that I could find interesting.\n-Grindind can be a pain, since there are moments where party members separates for a long time and when they come back they are 6 levels behind and you have to grind levels for them to catch up.\n-This game is so unoptimized, I mean, it needs a GTX 960 for this kind of graphics? I also heard of players having frame rate issues even with good video cards that fall into the recommended cattergory.\n\nSo my veredict:\nDon't buy it if you want a good story with good deep chracters.\nBuy it on sale if you just want a light hearted game where characters derp around most of the time\n", "timestamp_created": 1501715304, "timestamp_updated": 1501715304, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.314446", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33946271": {"recommendationid": "33946271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398801035", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1514103563}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u97f3\u4e50\u8425\u9020\u4e86\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6c1b\u56f4\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u6bd4\u524d\u51e0\u4f5c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u4e0d\u5c11\n[spoiler] \u4e0d\u8fc7\u5267\u60c5\u6ca1\u6709\u524d\u51e0\u4f5c\u90a3\u4e48\u840c\u8c5a\uff0c\u559c\u6b22\u4ec0\u4e48\u6837\u7684\u8fd8\u662f\u770b\u4e2a\u4eba[strike] \u840c\u8c5a\u6e38\u620f\u8981\u4ec0\u4e48\u5267\u60c5[/strike][/spoiler]\n\n\u6218\u6597\u7cfb\u7edf\u548cRB123\u6709\u70b9\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9002\u5e94\n\u8d85\u6b21\u5143\u7bc7\u7ae0\u91cc\u6709\u51e0\u4e2a\u8ff7\u5bab\u8981\u770b\u7740\u4e00\u6837\u989c\u8272\u7684\u5730\u677f\u53bb\u505a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u8d70\u8d77\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u96be\u53d7\n\n\u5de8\u578bboss\u6218\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u672c\u7cfb\u5217\u91cd\u590d\u5229\u7528\u7684\u529f\u529b\n\n\u4e0d\u8fc7V2R\u8981\u51fa\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0d\u662f\u7cfb\u5217\u5168\u6536\u7684\u53ef\u4ee5\u7b49V2R\n[spoiler]V2R\u53ef\u4ee5\u548c\u5927\u634f\u666e\u5728\u623f\u95f4\u91cc\u505a\u8fd9\u6837\u90a3\u6837\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u7528PSVR\u4eab\u53d7\u771f\u5b9e\u6b63\u7ecf\u4eba\u4f53\u9a8c[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1501583140, "timestamp_updated": 1501583300, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33937989": {"recommendationid": "33937989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198269556450", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 14926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501546036}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Megadimension Neptunia VII \u00e9 o quarto jogo da s\u00e9rie principal da saga neptunia, sendo ele um primeiro neptunia da nova gera\u00e7\u00e3o e tamb\u00e9m o melhor jogo da Nep, na minha opini\u00e3o. \n\nMas, primeiramente vamos a hist\u00f3ria do game.\nO jogo come\u00e7a com uma cutsceene em CG com a voz de uma garota se lamentando pelo estado daquele mundo, enquanto quatro gigantes aparecem destruindo uma cidade, no final ela aparece em uma colina, pedindo uma resposta...uma ajuda. Depois, come\u00e7a aquele monologo que geralmente tem nos jogos explicando sobre as deusas e seus feitos, aqui ele cita sobre um CPU Shift Period. Depois disso corta pra uma cena da Nep em um parque falando que teve um sonho estranho, ela escuta um barulho e vai l\u00e1 ver oque \u00e9, chegando l\u00e1, ela escuta uma voz, \"Algu\u00e9m me salve!\", ela fica confusa e voz novamente \"Algu\u00e9m, qualquer um...salve a Zero Dimension!\", ela n\u00e3o entende nada, mas acha um console no ch\u00e3o(console da qual ela nunca havia visto), ainda n\u00e3o entendendo nada, decide levar o console consigo. L\u00e1 ela mostra o console para Nepgear, Histoire chega e pergunta onde ela estava(mas aqui tem um detalhe importante, pois neptune cita que histoire foi criada pela primeira deusa de planeptune, coisa nunca antes falada), Histoire explica pra Neptune oque \u00e9 o Shift Period, ja que ela nem se lembrava, ela fala que \u00e9 a \u00e9poca em que as pessoas procuram novas deusas para seguir em vez das existentes, e fala pra ela levar isso a s\u00e9rio pois mal rumores seriam espalhados sobre ela, a Nep n\u00e3o da muita aten\u00e7\u00e3o e fala pra Nepgear ver o console, e mais uma vez a voz do console \"Algu\u00e9m, nos salve\", a Nepgear acha muito estranho e aperta o bot\u00e3o do console, oque faz com que abra um portal e sugue as duas para outra dimens\u00e3o. E \u00e9 a\u00ed que o jogo come\u00e7a.\n\nBom, e sobre a hist\u00f3ria, \u00e9 a melhor de toda a saga, o jogo cria todo um mist\u00e9rio em volta da nova personagem, a Uzume Tennouboushi(aquela da primeira cena), criando todo um desenvolvimento pra ela, e outra, a hist\u00f3ria est\u00e1 cheia de detalhes e cheio de explica\u00e7\u00f5es, tudo tem uma raz\u00e3o, al\u00e9m disso ele ainda consegue concertar alguns furos dos jogos anteriores e fala sobre coisas nunca antes faladas na s\u00e9rie, e o jogo ainda consegue conectar todas as hist\u00f3rias...apesar de deixar pequenos furos, mas s\u00f3 pra quem \u00e9 mais observador para perceber. E como o jogo \u00e9 feito para novos f\u00e3s tamb\u00e9m, n\u00e3o \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio jogar os jogos anteriores para entender a hist\u00f3ria, mas se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o jogou, vai pensar que est\u00e1 faltando coisa. Mas, ainda assim, no jogo tem alguns textos l\u00e1 na aba Nepedia que explicar\u00e1 algumas coisas.\n\nE agora, falando sobre o jogo em si, ele \u00e9 composto de 3 hist\u00f3rias ou grandes cap\u00edtulos, ZerodimensionZ, HyperdimensionG e HeartdimensionH. Cada um se passando em uma dimens\u00e3o, como o nome j\u00e1 diz, e cada uma tem uma \"abertura\", similar aquela do come\u00e7o do jogo. E agora sobre o sistema de batalha, esse que teve algumas modifica\u00e7\u00f5es, a primeira delas \u00e9 que agora, um dos 3 ataques mudou, agora s\u00e3o: Power(dano), Rush(combo) e Standart(algo entre os dois), a segunda mudan\u00e7a \u00e9 que agora, cada arma possui diferentes combos, por exemplo, em determinada arma voc\u00ea s\u00f3 pode botar 2 rushs, 3 powers e 1 standart, e voc\u00ea n\u00e3o pode equipar um mesmo ataque mais de uma vez. E agora, foi adicionado os combo trait, cada ataque ter\u00e1 um condi\u00e7\u00e3o do tipo \"o ataque anterior \u00e9 Power\", se voc\u00ea cumpre essa condi\u00e7\u00e3o sempre dar\u00e1 dano critico. Sobre os skills e Exe Drive, a barra de EXE Drive voltou, mas ele t\u00e1 bem enfraquecido, por\u00e9m \u00e9 mais f\u00e1cil de se usa-lo, a barra enche mais r\u00e1pido e em contrapartida, os skills ficaram mais fortes, o HDD tamb\u00e9m se ativa com o EXE Drive. Agora, al\u00e9m de boss battle normais, no jogo existem as Giant Battle, nelas voc\u00ea enfrenta aqueles gigantes, voc\u00ea s\u00f3 pode usar skills e fica se movendo em plataformas.\n\nSobre as Dungeons, elas receberam uma melhora impressionante, elas est\u00e3o bem mais amplas e bem mais detalhadas, chegando ao ponto de eu me perder em uma delas, e agora, tem alguns objetos destrut\u00edveis dentro das dungeons, eles dropam itens ou liberam caminho pra voc\u00ea pegar outros itens, mas voc\u00ea s\u00f3 poder\u00e1 destrui-los depois de ganhar o item Power Bracelet, e os monstros tamb\u00e9m est\u00e3o melhores visualmente(uma dica, os monstros pegam mais dano quando s\u00e3o atacados pelas costas ou pelos lados)...E mapa principal mudou tamb\u00e9m, agora voc\u00ea s\u00f3 pode se mover em umas linhas, chamadas de rotas, voc\u00ea seleciona um ponto e a personagem vai at\u00e9 ele, mas enquanto a personagem est\u00e1 indo, voc\u00ea pode ser atacado, e ai, inicia-se uma batalha, eu n\u00e3o vi problema nesse sistema no come\u00e7o, o problema dele \u00e9 perto do final, quando voc\u00ea tem que ir em pontos muito longes, ficar fazendo um monte de batalhas \u00e9 bem chatinho. O jogo tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o est\u00e1 dif\u00edcil...s\u00e3o mais alguns trechos ou chefes um pouco complicados, mas nada que vai deixar voc\u00ea l\u00e1 por muito tempo.\n\nO jogo n\u00e3o te da um monte de funcionalidades logo no come\u00e7o, na primeira hist\u00f3ria nem todas as funcionalidades do jogo est\u00e3o liberadas. Al\u00e9m do que j\u00e1 se podia fazer nas cidades(as lojas, disc devs, eventos e etc)agora voc\u00ea pode fazer mais algumas coisas(essas coisas s\u00f3 s\u00e3o adicionadas no segundo cap\u00edtulo), existe agora o Investiment, voc\u00ea pode investir em 3 \u00e1reas(Comerce, os itens da loja aumentar\u00e3o, Industrial, os itens do development aumentar\u00e3o e Public Relation, suas shares aumentar\u00e3o e voc\u00ea poder\u00e1 ver alguns eventos especiais, o nepstation por exemplo) e Scout, que \u00e9 igual o Stella Dungeon, mas agora voc\u00ea escolhe dungeons e coloca scouts pra explora-las, eles podem achar itens, dinheiro, outras dungeons e tesouros escondidos l\u00e1, mas voc\u00ea precisar\u00e1 encontrar fazendo alguns requisitos que o jogo pede, voc\u00ea pode upar os scouts tamb\u00e9m, o ruim do sistema \u00e9 q ele s\u00f3 funciona quando voc\u00ea est\u00e1 no jogo. O development citado anteriormente, \u00e9 igual o remake system(nas cidades voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m recupera sua vida). O lily rank recebeu mais aten\u00e7\u00e3o, al\u00e9m de dar mais ataque ou defesa, ele serve pra usar os coupling skills, q s\u00e3o quase iguais os formation skills. E falando sobre eles, agora eles  tem um novo jeito de se usar, voc\u00ea precisa cercar o inimigo que voc\u00ea quer usar, quando voc\u00ea estiver no local certo aparecer\u00e1 uma linha sobre elas. Agora as deusas tem tamb\u00e9m uma segunda transforma\u00e7\u00e3o, Next HDD, n\u00e3o vou falar muito...mas funciona como um segundo HDD e tamb\u00e9m tem um skill muito forte que s\u00f3 pode usar com essa transfoma\u00e7\u00e3o. Eu nunca havia falado sobre, mas a trilha sonora do jogo est\u00e1 muito boa, minha m\u00fasicas favoritas da nep, est\u00e3o nesse jogo.\nSobre os bugs, eu n\u00e3o vi o da intelig\u00eancia artificial desligar, mas tem um bug que acontece que se caso voc\u00ea conecte algum dispositivo USB no seu computador, o jogo fecha sozinho(mas talvez n\u00e3o aconte\u00e7a com voc\u00ea). \n\n\nMegadimension Neptunia VII, tem uma hist\u00f3ria muito boa, um gameplay bastante melhorado e uma trilha sonora \u00f3tima, e eu volto a falar esse \u00e9 o melhor jogo da s\u00e9rie Neptunia.

"playtime_forever": 4993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507090237}, "language": "english", "review": "Hello,\n\nI've finished the game recently, got all the achievments and decided to write a review.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nSexual jokes, fan service, predictable.\n\nThis is the canon story of the series. Similar to the rest, it also has dimension traveling. I'm sure you all are used to this. Anyhow, you get to meet a new character in a different dimension calling for help. As the main protagonist of protagonists, Neptune somehow happened just to be there. And the story sets off from there with problems related in between dimensions. It's quite long since there are like three stories within this game so be sure to save a lot. I recommend just to play through without guides first and get through the story at your own pace. If you want to get all the achievments, you need two playthroughs anyways. Besure to watch most of the events as you can and not get the bad end. (you don't get anything for bad end, just wasting your time). Youtube has it if you wanna know later.\nTranslations are as bad as always. If you watch anime a lot you just kinda know what they mean.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n\nRepetitive, but very well made.\n\nSome soundtracks are reused from the Re;Birth series like when they are about to transform, or something bad happened, or when they regained spirit. It does get repetitive as the time goes on. The new EXE soundtrack is quite nice, very different from the rest. It gives you a goosebump feeling with a certain EXE drive(ultimate skill). However the transition of them are not smooth, meaning they ended very abruptly instead of fading away, kinda kills the mood. But as you reach the end part of the game, you kinda skip all the attack animations so I'm guessing it doesn't not matter that much. But it will sure bugs you. My personal favorite aside from the EXE track (drive away) is Mousou Karthasis. It really does makes you want not to mess up the true ending.\n\nBoss battle theme is very nice too. I'm sure you can feel the tension.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nTedious, not innovative, lacks complexity. \n\n[b]Equipment+combat[/b]\n\nIf this is your first time with Nep series then you may be ok. But for me who have played the Re;Birth series, I got bored really fast because it's the same stuff. The combo building is a nice addition but it's very linear. If you build combo correctly with the right traits then you can do crits damage. Different weapons have different combo slots making it very difficult to get the right combo traits to fit in every slot. Characters only have a specific amount of skills you can use and you cannot reuse the same skill, one skill one slot. Everytime the characters switch back and forth, you gotta change their equipments again. \u00af\\_\u0ca0_\u0ca0_/\u00af\n\nNormal combos do more damage than an ultimate skill. (\u256f\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0\uff09\u256f\ufe35 \u253b\u2501\u253b . Unheard of, feels bad when I watch a 20 second animation for an attack and it does 1/4 of normal attacks on one turn. Even, if you have unlimited EXE drive (energy needed to perform an ultimate), normal hit does more. Most bosses in colosseum are prone to elemental attacks. Elemental attacks are very very limited between characters. But hey Million Arthur DLC character has all the elements making her the most versatille character in the game. I see what you did there IF. Seriously, who did the balancing on this crap?\n\nThere is absolutely no reason to craft weapons or use any of the equipment in game since most would use the DLC equipments anyways making it very very unrewarding. Even if you tried very hard to get a weapon you want, the stats are so crap that it's very discouraging; this goes as well for the Processors set (transformation armor). Only craft for the achievment. Drop rate/mob spawn rate is a pain so please feel free to use use a trainer. \n\nLily ranking (affection between characters), really unnecessary. 10 levels total. One character needs to get level 10 with all the characters for an achivement. Level 10 buffs are whatever since you'd finished the game by that point. Refer to guides how to get it. Though, you'd have to battle enemies 1000+ for an achivement too so it just comes naturally haha.  \n\n[b]Dungeons[/b]\n\nYou get to break boxes in the dungeons (again for achievment purposes), items are not neccsary to progress characters. To be able to break all the breakable items, you need a level 2 breaker which you get after you complete the worst hit detection dungeon after dodging, jumping, tilting, hell, I even threw my controller and took a break after I died so many times over no absolute reason and that death music makes me so salty. There are safe spots, and absolute death spots even though it look safe to you. Watch youtube if you're stuck on this dungeon (Neplunker). Boxes blocks certain path making you walk all around the map to progess further. Seriously, I probably spend my time walking more than doing actually battles.\n\nRecycles dungeons everywhere. Like 7 unique dungeons total? The rest is change of monsters and change of color. Heck the music for them is the same. The dungeons are designed so that they make you walk the longest distance to get to the end point. It became so predictable that I managed to make a single trip towards the exit with an unexplored minimap without retracing. Oh the dungeon(s) towards the end game are like a lazy side on the game designers, you'll see what I mean. Plus, there's a dungeon where there's no data on the mini-map. I had to go through it three times to the end level for the achievment... Luckily guides are available. \n\nThere is scouting system where you send npcs to explore and gather info (additional enemies+clue for hidden treasures+'new' recycled dungeon). Yes, gotta get them all for the achivement \"Treasure hunter\" got all the hidden treasures in the game. You can level up scouts with materials that are very rare to find. Can get in colosseum battles. Some clue for hidden treasures including \"Defeat all deployed enemies\" (wtf...), remember the no mini-map dungeon? Yeah, twice on that. Also making consecutive symbol attacks 12 times without enemies notice you aka strike them first. You can easily do this by escaping battle and do it again. However, all the accumulative attack times resets if you miss an attack even though enemies do not notice you, so don't miss. It's really stupid... Who coded this? The rewards from the hidden treasures are very dissapointing as well. \u30fe(*\uff40\u0414\u00b4*)\uff89\"\n\nRandom battle encounters+Random battle encounters: feels like pokemon all over again except it's not pokemon\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\n\nI can only recommend because I am a fan so this review is biased. I really like the new main character, it gives a fresh taste compare the the Re;Birth series. I do wish this game to get animate at some point in the future. The writing is well pace. I laughed at some point, teared up sometimes, and got goosebumps when the music hits. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience for me within the first playthrough. The DLC characters are also very unique in terms of personalities; finally Vert has an accomplice. Game also stutters as well as having rendering issues so make sure your graphic drivers are good. Refund if not playable.\n\nIf you play for all achievments, you really need a macro and a trainer since two are RNG based. Abusing save is somewhat cheating anyways so just break your own gaming morality like I did because I was sitting there 1/2 hr opening a single item over at a rate of 2.5/sec and not get it. Achievments hunting in this game or the series even is time consuming not really skill based so I'm some what disappointed. Combat could have been better. Too grindy to be fun. No replay value in that.\n\n7/10 C+ waiting for 4 Godesses Online\n\nThanks for reading, Hope it helps.\n\nP.S.

So, i'll tell you per chapters review.\n\n1. Zero Dimension Neptune Z: Twilight of The Desperate CPU\nThis is where you start, when Neptune pressed a button at a Swirly marked console, Neptune and Nepgear thrown to Zero Dimension where in this dimension seems really a scrapyard place.\n\nThe difficulty of this main story is can't be compromised enough, i've fallen to game over screen more than twice. Why?\n- No DLC except Free DLC can company you through the end of this main story\n- The monsters are really tough, you can't stick with only with a combo.\n\nBut i've managed to finish this 1st trilogy at all characters gone to lvl 21.\n\n2. Hyperdimension Neptunia G: The Golden Leaders, Recontructors of Gamindustri\nAfter fighting with Dark CPU at Zero Dimension, Neptune and Nepgear set back to Hyper Dimension where they come from. It's was currently at CPU Shift Period where many hoaxes between four nations are spread out. Neptune came with an idea to make a Festival and held a competition. At the final phase, four unknown person named 'Gold Third' came and defeated Four CPU.\n\nIn this 2nd trilogy, all DLC can be used. If you want to play this game as challanging as enough, don't buy or use any DLCs. It'll break the game. Why?\n- DLC Characters are carried over to other CPU Story.\n- The chatacter levels are grown up continously, can you imagine when playing Vert's Playtrough starting with lvl 21 and you have own DLC Characters at lvl 30? Sounds easy right?\n\n3. Heart Dimension Neptunia H: Trilogy Finale, Into the Despair...\nEnd of the trilogy, a black hole appeared above gamindustri's sky. Neptune and gang set off to investigate about it. \n\nThis last trilogy has it's own dimension called \"Heart Dimension\" which is really makes me scared about it. The dimension itself seems not realible for someone to live.\n\n=======================================================\nMain Review, comparing to Rebirth series.\n\n1. Number of Playable Characters (Default)\nRebirth 3 > VII\n\n2. Monster Difficulty\nRebirth Series < VII\n\n3. EXP and Grinding\nRebirth Series > VII\n\n4. Others\n- In VII, plan are different in rebirth series. It's much more like crafting system.\n- Challanges are available, but it's easier than Rebirth 3\n- Combo system are different. you can't use the same combo at the time, your combo pattern is decided by the weapon itself and in addition of that, there's combo trait that increase damage if the combo trait has triggered.\n- Disc Dev will no longer have increased EXP chip or anything like that, but you can Dev a disc that has \"Learning\" ability. Allows you to receive EXP when not at front party.\n- EXP distribution is only for front party or characters has \"Learning\" Ability.\n- There is no \"Stella's Dungeon\" anymore and has replaced with \"Scout\" which has ability to explore a dungeon which gains items, credits, discover a new dungeon, found a hidden treasure secrets, found a new enemy, also found a new scout to send it to scout.\n- EXE Drive Gauge is only per battle and not stored when finished battle. The EXE Drive Gauge easily to fill itself when facing more than 1 enemy and using rush combos.\n- Haven't tried to break damage limit, since it's still too hard to get 9999 damage. My max single damage is still around 5k so i don't know too much about this.\n- New skill type: Combination Skill. Link up with corresponding character to use Combination Skill (EXE Drive Gauge required)\n- Transforming to HDD Form or Gold Mode cost 1 EXE Drive Gauge. Rebirth series don't even need it.\n- The fastest way to increase lily power between character is to put target at front party.\n- Most impartant thing at RPG. \"You can STEAL ITEMS!\"\n- Break the breakable props to find hidden items, instead of jumping or searching with radar.\n- No more \"Tough Enemies\". Only Enemy Change.\n- No more \"System Plan\". You can't make enemies weaker or stronger, or something similliar with Rebirth series's System Plan.\n- There's still Nepstation, but it seems like no more quiz?\n- You'll face two Neptune. Yes, Two Neptunes.\n- Rarity are applied to VII. Currently only saw R and SR.\n- More hits means more EXP, meanwhile more Damage Dealt means more Credits.\n- There are Investment features, which grants you a new shop lineup, new items to craft, and maybe free stuff from citizen.\n- Entering dungeon by pointing nep cursor to dungeons? no. Create a line to target's dungeon in order to enter a dungeon, and then see your party's leader running to target.", "timestamp_created": 1500417511, "timestamp_updated": 1500417511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33630019": {"recommendationid": "33630019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037818535", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498194213}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5386\u4ee3\u6d77\u738b\u661f\u6700\u597d\u73a9\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u4e30\u5bcc\u800c\u4e14\u5176\u6536\u96c6\u8981\u7d20\u4e5f\u4f7f\u5f97\u591a\u5468\u672b\u6e38\u73a9\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\u5f88\u9ad8[spoiler] \u6211\u6ca1\u8bd5\u8fc7\u4e09\u5468\u76ee\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u771f\u7ed3\u5c40\u6253\u51fa\u6765\u4e86\u540e\u5c31\u6ca1\u6709\u9057\u61be\u4e86[/spoiler]\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672c\u4eba\u5165\u5751\u4f5c\uff0c\u5f53\u7136\u662f\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u5566[spoiler] \u51b2\u7740\u5927NEP\u548c\u63d2\u753b\u5165\u7684\u5751\t[/spoiler]\n\u6700\u540e\u5410\u69fd\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u7956\u4f20\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u4e86\u591a\u5c11\u5e74\u4e86\u554a......", "timestamp_created": 1500384347, "timestamp_updated": 1500384347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33624098": {"recommendationid": "33624098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144402711", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 3716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510292433}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u4f5c\u73a9\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u8bf4\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u5bb9\u975e\u5e38\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u8010\u73a9\u6027\u4e0a\u8981\u6bd4\u524d\u51e0\u4f5c\u90fd\u8981\u591a\u7684\u591a\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1500361228, "timestamp_updated": 1500361228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33612654": {"recommendationid": "33612654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155616973", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508724697}, "language": "english", "review": "Megadimension neptunia V2 is a large open world game that has a main story line throughout 3 chapters. you can change your weapons, clothes, have custom combo attacks and formation attacks.

I utterly detested the introduction of route building as having to connect locations with a route, and then follow the routes to get anywhere served only to waste time...especially with the random battles you would get into along the way. Simply getting anywhere for the story, never mind grinding rapidly became an annoying experience.\n\nLesser irritations included the game deciding the equipment on your characters whenever new characters entered the party, which wouldn't have been too bad a problem if it weren't for how often characters enter and leave (also the game would sometimes seem to change equipment setups even with characters that didn't leave the party). The investment system may have been interesting in concept but in practice it just meant grinding more credits.\n\nWe also had the new characters: Uzume/Orange Heart was ok; Adult Neptune failed to add anything (she actually at times made me dislike her) and the Gold Third (C-Sha, S-Sha, E-Sha and B-Sha) I pretty much entirely disliked. \n\nThere's also all the characters dropped from this game such as Plutia/Iris Heart, but even more surprisingly Falcom, Mages., MarvelousAQL and Broccoli. Sure, they weren't main characters but they were still staples of the series.\n\nMixed impressions:\nThe battle system revamp, while small was a step forward in trying to get players to do more than hit a single button. The dungeons had more interesting designs, though this was coupled with some annoyances in traversing them (best exemplified by the Golden Summit in Leanbox and especially with parts of Neplunker). \n\nThe Good:\nThe music for the game was easily the best of the series. Neptunia banter (pretty much the usual here, though I didn't think it was quite as good).\n\nSummary:\nI've seen a lot of people hold up Megadimension Neptunia VII as the best of the series, and quite frankly I can't see it. This was the first time I actually struggled to bring myself to finish one of the mainline Neptunia games and the only time with them that upon getting my first ending for the game I was like \"Well, game finished, I'm done, time to move on to the next entry in my backlog.\" \n\nIf I was to recommend a Neptunia game, it'd be Rebirth 3 or 1. In fact, I might actually recommend Rebirth 2 over this (and I never would have thought I'd recommend 2 over any mainline Neptunia games before). Megadimension Neptunia VII I honestly feel I can safely say is the worst of the mainline Neptunia games. I hope that Idea Factory can get back to the feel of the Rebirth games, as even with their faults, I vastly prefer all 3 of them to this.", "timestamp_created": 1500272195, "timestamp_updated": 1500273454, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461948", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33600185": {"recommendationid": "33600185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101164580", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508639185}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would nep again", "timestamp_created": 1500264968, "timestamp_updated": 1500264968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485437", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33596011": {"recommendationid": "33596011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170389673", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1185, "last_played": 1514841319}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Pra come\u00e7ar, eu sou um f\u00e3 de JRPG's, e adoro jogos como Final Fantasy, bravily, dragon quest, Fire Emblem e a lista continua...\n..e na minha opini\u00e3o, esse jogo n\u00e3o perde em nada para os jogos citados acima.

lan\u00e7ado da SEGA, o project neptune \"que foi anunciado mais foi can\u00e7elado antes de seu lan\u00e7amento\", a Noire, representando os consoles de mesa da sony, a Blanc, os consoles de mesa da nintendo, e a Vert, representando o xbox, e elas tem suas irm\u00e3s mais novas, a Nepgear \"que seria uma continua\u00e7\u00e3o do gamegear, da SEGA\", a Uni, que representa os portateis da sony e as irm\u00e3s Rom e Ram, representando os console portateis da nintendo \"a Ram \u00e9 a ver\u00e7\u00e3o de tamnho normal, como o 3ds, e a Rom representa os maiores, como o 3ds xl\"\n\nCom os personagens principais explicados, a primeira coisa que eu pensei quando ouvi isso de um amigo foi: esse jogo deve ser meio cliche...\n...muito pelo contrario, o jogo explora cada detalhe desses consoles, como propagandas, jogos, ate mesmo como a empressa que os vaz se comporta no mercado, e coloca tudo isso com uma historia boa, com seus momento engra\u00e7ados e momento tristes \"ate mesmo com momento serios que se torn\u00e3o comedia total\"\n\nSobre a qualidade grafica, se voce se emporta muito com graficos realistas, talves voce estranhe um pouco o jogo, mais depois que se acustuma voce ve que o grafico do jogo combina com ele...\n\nA trilha sonora e muito boa tem musicas que me marcar\u00e3o como minicar e remnant \"e olha que eu me inporto muito com a trilha sonora...\" por exemplo, quando voce ta em um momento serio e do nada come\u00e7a a tocar minicar, voce nem precila ler a fala pra seber que o momento provavelmente vai ficar engra\u00e7ado\n\nOs pontos negativo que eu achei do jogo s\u00e3o seu bad ending \"que eu estava esperando algo meis sombrio...\" e a facilidade que voce tem na maioria do gameplay \"depois eu joguei o re:birth 1, e eu levei um

reused in the games so this one is quite different, it uses a new engine which looks so SO much better but its still optimised nicely.\n\nThe combat system is similar to the past few games but additions have been made to to the combo system so its easier to understand and more fluid and action packed. There is a lot more emphasis on strategy in this game compared to the last ones as a result there is a higher chance of you dying several times which is nice as it was easy to steamroll through the past few games they made. \n\nEach of the big four get a second stage of HDD and in turn they are getting new combos and style systems to follow suit. Theres different types of combat that you will face as well with the new types of bosses which are massive, you have to move and create patterns and lines around the bosses to best them as effectively as possible. \n\nStory and banter is just as good as always but the theme of this seems to be a bit more mature at times but still hilarious none the less.

reference???\n- Neplunker is fun\n- The way boobs bounce in this game makes you feels like a miserable human being\n\nCons :\n- One of the heroine is a mentally unstable jailbait\n- They sometimes recycle the dungeon, and just change the name and monster spawn\n- Ahh, they also recycle the monster (this is problematic, since some monster share the exact same sprite but the other one can be ridiculously OP)\n- Monster hitbox is a mess, this is a big problem due to symbol attack and secret treasure mechanic (the battle start when you make contact with monster, however for some monster the hitbox ridiculously bigger than it's sprite)\n\nThis is my first Neptunia game, overall i'm very pleased with this game and planning to buy Neptunia VS Sega Hard Girls. \nAt 7-8 USD, this game is

a little differently then others. It is broken up into sections. Theres the begining. Then there is a part where you play 4 different story sections with the 4 cpus. Then there is the wierd gold third part. Then finally the end. \n\nThe onlly part i did not like about the game is they pretty much re used the same jokes over and over again from the previous games. If you do not have a lewd since of humor you may not get any of them. \n\nAnyways battle is your typical action turn based rpg game play where it is pretty much like the tales of series. If you \nplayed the previous nep nep games then you basically played them all. \n\nExcept this game adds giant battles. Even though there is very few of them and all you have to do is spam your skills and heal ever now and then.  In the gian battles you are in your cpu forms right away you need to use the rock formations to move around on the field. \n\nMy only advice is to not have the cpuson the same rock section.\nThe music is more or less the same i didn't really notice any new tracks. \n\nDungeons play out the game you are in a 3d space and you move around in it.

The story seems simple at first, but it quickly gets more interesting and addicting, and towards the end when you think you know the ending, you don't. It pulls the rug from under you and surprises you by just being a great story.\n\nIts just wonderful how they managed to make a story that connects everything so well together.\n\nOther than that this game is filled with anime and gaming tropes, and it references both mediums a lot. 4th wall is broken constantly and the fun, lovable *bubbly* characters just bring a smile to my face every time I see them.\n\nGameplay is a bit repetetive, but its nothing new if you have played JRPGs before.

Because its not like rebirth 1 with all of that grinding.\n2. Its not like rebirth 2 and with a short story and a hour worth of nep's.\n3. Its not like rebirth 3 with the over powered dlc weapons and characters.\n\nMegadimension VII offers a whole new way of playing like investment in citys and route building ill explain.\ninvestment is 3 different types of ways to spend money to help you inprove your Megadimension life.\n1.Commerse is, each level you upgrade will enable you to buy more items form the shop.\n2.industrial is, the items you will be able to develop will increase's\n3.puplic relations is, the higher the level the better the stuff you get from your country, such as processer units, healing items, other usefull items, and of course the nepquiz and walletcrusher on of the best shows on television.\n\nThe route building is a much better way of travelling instead on instant teleportation like on the rebirth series. at first you have to use credits to purchase the route that you want to build too. and in the route building you can encounter random enemies when travelling, but if you have a new game+ you can disable that, but whats the fun in a quick and easy playthrough.\n\nMegadimension VII starts in 1 part of 3 stories, Zero dimension, hyperdimension, heartdimension.\nwith all these storys you would expect this to be a long game, well your right there is about 40-50hours if gameplay in all 3 storys and you will never be bored there is new areas and Finally a better villan, well a few awesome villans. (not gonna spoil anything) no offence to Arbore, pop-up purple had, arsnore what ever her name was.\n\nThe 1 bad thing about this game is that if you play this for countless hours, you will love the way the game looks and then when you go back too the rebirth series you feel a bit.... odd.\n\nnow lets talk about the Gold Third even thought there are 4 members.\nC-Sha (the Leader): She's more of a glutton than her looks may suggest, and she can't do so much as lift a finger on an empty stomach. \n\nS-Sha:  A young woman who's reserved and seems very cool, but has a considerably aggravated case of chuunibyou. She has two Dogoo-like monsters who serve under her. \n\nB-Sha: she likes to build robots, collect hero toys and serve as a hero of justice. However, her phobia of monsters prevents her from doing this job efficiently. Because of this, she transforms into the mysterious hero known as Presto Mask to give herself confidence.\n\nK-Sha: K-Sha is a yandere when it comes to Noire. She's very protective and cares passionately about her, though in a somewhat romantic way which annoys Noire occasionally. when holding a gun however, K-Sha's personality changes drastically. Rather then being shy, she becomes dead serious and will complete her missions without question. Much like Uni, K-Sha is skilled with guns.\n\nNow we go with \nuzume Tennoboshi: Uzume is the type of girl who is obsessed with being cool so that she comes off as reliable. Uzume is exceptionally loyal and honest to her friends, Very rarely will you see her relax unless she is around friends. However, this is a very strong willed facade made to help cope with her position as Zero Dimension's sole remaining CPU.\n\nThis game has to be one of the best Neptunia Games, because its a 2016 game the graphics are amazing, the new systems inplemented into the game are cool too, and of course new characters, and remodel'ed characters. its a very facinating game that deserves to be called a Neptunia Game.\n\nThis game is like 3 games in one. and deserves to be $39.99 + DLC costs.\n\nat first when i bought this, i thought was that you can build a country from the ground up from one of the acheivements that was listed, but thats alright this game was a really good one anyway. cant wait for future Nep Games, Especially 4GO,\n\nIm gonna Rate this a 9.5/10\n\nthe -.5 is becasue i had to but game in windowed mode for it not to crash suddenly.\n\nOverall Best Game 2016.", "timestamp_created": 1496207663, "timestamp_updated": 1498494057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 389, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.914375", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32053811": {"recommendationid": "32053811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027445661", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482940074}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "NEP NEP NEP ~", "timestamp_created": 1496109210, "timestamp_updated": 1496109210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32042893": {"recommendationid": "32042893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288633945", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500560417}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u65b0V2R8\u6708\u53d1\u552e\u554a\uff0c8\u4efd\u7684\u897f\u74dc\u6700\u597d\u5403\u4e86\n[spoiler]\u201c\u6211\u4e5f\u662f\u6765\u63a8\u9500\u65e5\u672c\u897f\u74dc\u7684\u201d[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1496069183, "timestamp_updated": 1496069550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32037329": {"recommendationid": "32037329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128977774", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496219768}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u840c\u8c5a\u7684\u6700\u7231\uff0cCV\u597d\u8bc4\uff0c\u4eba\u7269\u597d\u8bc4\u3002o(\u2229_\u2229)o", "timestamp_created": 1496045567, "timestamp_updated": 1496045567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32025973": {"recommendationid": "32025973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017231183", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4072, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498340323}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u97f3\u58f0\u3060\u3051\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3084\u3057\u552f\u4e00\u306e\u6551\u3044\u3060\u306a\uff01\n\u304a\u307e\u56fd\u3001\u307b\u3093\u3068\u3084\u3060", "timestamp_created": 1495995654, "timestamp_updated": 1495995654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32001842": {"recommendationid": "32001842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003665368", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 14889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "last_played": 1514326086}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun, cute, and silly jrpg about video games.

Joining the cast is a talking fish named Umio, Uzume who is totally cool and not a valley girl or anything, and adult Neptune who is exactly the same as Neptune but with boobs and long hair. The four godessess get more powerful forms about halfway in the story. There are three dimensions to explore. So many new processors, weapons, dungeons, monsters, music tracks, outfits, and characters set this game apart from the last three.

If you're coming from the Re;Birth games, know that there are some fundamental differences between this game and them. I'm on my second playthrough at the moment to get another ending, the first took about 60 hours. I'll list the pros and cons now:\n\nPROS\n\n+ Improved graphics. Didn't think I'd ever say that about a Neptunia game, but there you have it. You'll notice the improvements right away when you take control of Nep for the first time.\n+ New cool enemies. They made a bunch of new monsters to keep things fresh.\n+ There are fewer dungeons, but each is now massive compared to the previous games. Some have up to 4 different areas.\n+ Improved battle gameplay. EXE gauge is back but balanced. It charges way faster but is depleted after every fight. EXE moves are now better balanced and considerably weaker, sometimes it's better to just use a skill or a normal combo instead of an EXE.\n+ Combos have changed. There's no easy way to explain this, but the combos you build will depend on your weapon. You can't repeat the same move, and each of them has a certain condition that if met, will land a sure critical hit. Choosing weapons is not just about stats and area of attack anymore.\n+ The controller vibrates with attacks, making them pretty satysfying.\n+ Formation skills. Like EXEs, they aren't particularly strong but now you need to make an actual formation to use them (line, triangle or square) and the move will hit every enemy caught inside.\n+ Scout system. Some may dislike this, some my like it. Instead of Stella's Dungeon, now you have multiple Scouts that you can send everywhere to get items for you and provide bonuses while you're in the dungeon they were deployed to. For example, if you want to grind for credits you can send every Scout with a Credits UP bonus to a dungeon you like and then go grind there. The Scouts will also find new dungeons, unlock new monsters in dungeons and bring back new scouts.\n+ More challenging than the previous games.\n+ A new epic type of boss battle. Not too difficult, but looks awesome!\n+ New fun characters. I don't think anyone can dislike Steamax.\n+ Great story. Lots of mysteries that you'll piece back together at the end.\n\nCONS\n\n- Routes and route building. In my opinion, a major flaw in this game's design. Now instead of just selecting from the map the dungeon or city you want to go, they are now connected by routes that your character will need to traverse to get from one place to another. This process may trigger random encounters and can take quite a bit of time if you want to go from a dungeon in Leanbox to another near Lowee, for example. It's extremely annoying and time consuming for no good reason.\n- Party building. This may or may not be a small story spoiler, so read at your own risk. [spoiler]Thought you could get a stable party early on? Nope. The girls will get constantly separated into parties of two or three through the whole game. Only near the end you'll have all of them together to finally form your dream party. The way this is handled story-wise is pretty cool, but considering it's an RPG this was very frustrating. [/spoiler]\n- Investment. You can now invest in cities to unlock new plans, items for sale and events. Compared to the previous games where you would find this stuff while exploring.. this is a big money sink.\n- There are fewer plans, from what I can tell. I ended up only making a few (6 or so) because for some reason the materials seemed very hard to come by.\n- The Scouts can be bothersome to manage. You need to be in a city to get their report, not from the menu like Stella's Dungeon. Also minor (and expected) story spoiler: [spoiler]There are three different dimensions. You can't get a report from a Scout that you sent to another dimension, so you have to travel all the way there through the annoying routes to get their stuff, and then come back to whatever you're doing. Of course, this can be avoided by not sending them to other dimensions. [/spoiler]\n- Characters won't level up if they aren't in the main fighting party. Some of them have the \"Learning\" ability that lets them do so, but most don't.\n- Lily rank seems to increase very slowly when coupling. But now it also increases very quickly between all the four front row characters. So before coupling a pair, you might want to let them fight side by side first.\n\nOverall this is a great addition to the Neptunia series. There are some mechanics that could be improved, but this is a mostly fresh game, different from what we're used to. I'm extremely happy that Idea Factory and Compile Heart came this far with Nep games. Now we wait for Cyber Dimension 4 GO!\n", "timestamp_created": 1494934269, "timestamp_updated": 1494934269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590596", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31783272": {"recommendationid": "31783272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031826186", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 6465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 398, "last_played": 1514019031}, "language": "english", "review": "Slightly sad that some of the classic makers don't make a reappearance, especially me waifu MAGES..\n\nHowever, the new -Sha girls are cool, the dlc characters are cool (except nitroplus imo, but even I can't denie her insanely powerful debuffs.

If your new, I'd recomend Re;birth 1 or 2 just to make the rest of the games a bit more enjoyable.

Why? Because it has taken me by surprise. First let me tell you about what I think as pros and cons of this game:\n\nPros: \n\n-Great story\n-Loveable characters, even the new ones\n-Transformation sequence (Finally!)\n-Great voice actors\n-Amazing VN artworks\n-Great soundtracks\n-Dedicated cutscenes with 3D graphics (It's not great, but it's a progress)\n\nCons:\n\n-Outdated graphics\n-Uninspiring and tedious dungeons\n-The second arc of the story feel more like a filler \n-Awkward animations\n-Random encounters (can only be disabled in new game+)\n-They still reusing some assets from previous games and sometimes doesn't even bother to \n make it look a little bit different\n\nWhile the previous installments are loveable by many fans (including me), I always find myself struggling to finish it because of the generic, cliche story and boring gameplay. But that's not the case with Megadimension Neptunia VII. The main reason why I love Megadimension Neptunia so much is because the story is above my expectation. It's not the usual \"all time fun\" story like the previous games, it's more emotional, serious and engaging. Many of the characters that has appeared since the beginning of the series show more depth in their personality, especially Nepgear. The new characters: Uzume, Umio and the Gold Third is also loveable. I will even admit that Uzume has become my favorite character in Neptunia series.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, no, and maybe I overhyping it a bit in my review. But it certainly the best game that the series has to offer as for now and I really like it. Other people might have a different opinion, but If I must rate this game, I would rate it 8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1493206663, "timestamp_updated": 1511437749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

characters are, as always, full of the Nepnep atmosphere that you would expect from the serie, I wouldn't ask more from the graphic, and I could say more and get boring with technical stuff.\n\nLets be honest, its a Neptunia game, so its perfect as that if you find a con, there will be one or more pro to balance to the awesome side. I could say some stuff, but I won't spoil.\n\nThe game as a great replayability (sorry if i have a bad grammar). After your first run, which as big chance to get the normal ending, you get new features that, thanks whatever God or thing you believe in, you were wishing for in the first run.\n\nFirst playable male character is a fish. See Umio DLC. No, seriously, a fish, and the most awesome fish you will ever see. Pretty fashion fish.\n\nI'd say, buy this game as soon as you want. Hunt the specials or whatever, but get it. Umio is a life saver, and the other DLC character are up to you and your knowledge if the reference they are. I got God Eater because I love that serie and understand all the little references, but sadly getting Nitroplus for me would be a cool character that is unknown to me.\nWeapons and Processor Unit are overkill, only activate them after you get the perfect ending. My opinion, you do what you want.\n\nMusic wise, I love it. Deluxe pack give you all, ordered, named, divided in two themed disc folder.\n\nBuy it, but play the previous titles before to not lose some greatness of Nepnep. You don't want to miss Plutia, I swear you don't. Get the previous titles.\n\nI give it the rating of Uni Curry out of Lastation Curry.

EXE bar charges quicker but resets every battle, the map is connected by roads, you can invest, send scouts around, play neplunker, they removed that thing that tells you where the items drop, there are epic as fuck battles against giant enemies, you can break body parts --- The list would be very long. Some of those changes are good, some aren't, and you're gonna find many complaints about said elements, but let me tell you something.\n\nIt doesn't really matter if they are good or bad. The fact that they are there is to make you feel you're playing something new, to make you understand that they didn't just copypaste RE;Birth 3. And I believe it worked: the game feels fresh, even if it's basically the same Neptunia game in the end.\n\nAs for the second area, well, it's AMAZING. The music is a masterpiece, the plot is meh (not bad, but not that exciting either), new characters are awesome (Uzume is such a great one I couldn't believe it), the art and animation is really funny and greatly improved, and the voice acting is the stuff of legends. You know how there are some characters that are not that interesting like Ram or Nepgear? Well forget all that shiet, because they now have GREAT lines and are voiced in a way that you can't do anything else but love them.\n\nSomething I was a little disappointed with was the video quality for the video sequences. They feel weird, the colors are strange looking, IDK.\nAlso there are some new drawings for characters like Vert and Noire, they are not at an angle but stare directly at you, and they look a little puffy and silly. The others are good, but those two are way worse.\n\nOverall, yes, definitely buy this game. It's the most fun I've had since a very long time.\nAnd it has Nep Nep in it, so that should be enough by itself.", "timestamp_created": 1492523313, "timestamp_updated": 1492523313, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31179770": {"recommendationid": "31179770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316700634", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499410758}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u6574\u4f53\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u6c49\u5316\u5c31\u66f4\u597d\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1492353652, "timestamp_updated": 1492353652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480769", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31170775": {"recommendationid": "31170775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102963892", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492262941}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u840c\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1492318632, "timestamp_updated": 1492318632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31154689": {"recommendationid": "31154689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162001037", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498837249}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u628a\u4f60\u4eec\u634f\u666e\u634f\u666e\u6389\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1492256919, "timestamp_updated": 1492256919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31154217": {"recommendationid": "31154217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279749974", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506653752}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u5e94\u8be5\u6362\u7535\u8111\u4e86\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u56db\u5973\u795eOL\u5929\u4e0b\u7b2c\u4e00", "timestamp_created": 1492255247, "timestamp_updated": 1492255247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31150133": {"recommendationid": "31150133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173746479", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509149814}, "language": "english", "review": "This game series has been my overall favorite of all time since i've started steam.

(I was wrong AF) I didnt knew nothing about Neptunia games.. But in the end.. I was completely blown away from the content this game offered for the price !\nI played many type of games before and I never had the sense of a \"full\" solo game since \"SaintsRow2\".\nI'm not saying that those other games I've played between the time I've play SR2 to the time I do this review were not games that were not \"full\". But rather say that.. 3D, 2D, VisualNovel, MMO, or whatever Does not matter when it comes to a games that is made almost flawlesly (Or personally Flawless).\nTo me, NeptuniaVII just felt Perfect in content and story.\n\nI have now started Hyperdevotion Noire and Re:Brith3. \nI have also started to watch the anime of Hyperdimension Neptunia :) (Its really good IMO)\n\n[b] My Gaming path: (Sub Intro)[/b]\n(Some said in my past reviews that I dont know gaming, Its ok I dont want to prove I know something. But rather explaine my perception of view on games)\n\nI am the type of gamer that play most of the time MMO's and Competition games. Since i'm very open toward any type of game, I gave the chance of SO many different games.. But in the end 99% of them made me feel like the game was just designed to look good visualy, to show revolutionare features or to look really apealing. \nSome of those personal \"PublicStuntGames\" Include: Apb:Reloaded, Watchdog, GTA5, Battlefield 1, CoD:Bo2-Zombies, Black Desert Online, (and more). (Ps. I Love BDO)\nI know many love those games, But to me.. They are games the biggest aspect that were polished in those game.. were the selling points.\n[b] Example of How I see those games (Not actual review): [/b] Watchdog was pushed to be sold for graphics(even tho they failed there anyways) they also didn't delivered the possiblities that the game could had offer.. /// Apb is a game made to lure those who ever wanted a \"Gta-like MMO\" But deliver the minimum basic of a \"Gta-Like\".. (Basic.. might be too much to say how low the quality of \"gta-like\" content is in the game) And also dont deliver many mmo features. /// BDO... an mmorpg that is Over-polished on the graphics side.. The content is big.. but 0 tutorial from the devs, 0 explaination, 0 guides from the devs.. The \"What im I gonna do next?\" is not answered by the game at all. The story is rushed to the point of being almost inexistant.\n\n[h1] THE REVIEW ! [/h1]\n\n[b] First playthrough: [/b]\n\n[u] Ending: Failed(Bad ending) --- Gamestyle: Rushed --- Cutscenes / Voice: Listened - Videos: Watched - Text: Skiped\t[/u]\n\nWhen I entered the game I didnt knew what to expect !\nFIRST thing I did.. what to trow my headphone away and die... (Or almost) XD\nWent in my sound volume and lowered the Neptunia game volume T_T\nFirst the little cinematic that rocks xD And then the little \"arcade\" Menu.. Its when I was like \"Oh no... The game looks really empty :/\"(I was so wrong..).\nThen I clicked with a MOUSE \"New game\". \n[b] The NEXT part will contain spoilers, \"Black boxes\" over the text mean its a spoilers, dont hover your mouse on it if you dont want to be spoiled ![/b]\nAt first its start like a visual novel, The voices (English) were AMAZING, The animation Really great and the first little bit of the story got me hooked :)\n[spoiler] Then The game REALLY started o.o\" After the little \"intro\" the game started in Zero dimension with a Super awesome Anime-like Intro ! Music 9/10, animation 8/10 OP(overall) 9/10.\n\nI was hyped ! The OP got me like OMG.. its not started yet O.o? XD\nAnother \"start the game menu\" apear... Im like.. \"WTF? oh.. so its like many mini games?\"..(I was so wrong AGAIN xD) \n[/spoiler]\nSo I start the gameplay with a MOUSE. and im like.. wow.. wtf? Its unplayable... eww...\nWhat is this gameplay anyways? ._. \nI then pluged my Xbox Controller in my PC, Had to restart the game.\nHit \"Continue\" and IM BACK :D\nAjusted my sensivity, took a little look at the menu. Every think looked great !\n\nFirst \"3D\" Interactions:\nSo I was HEY :D Im in a 3d anime game :D Might aswell jump of joy :D !...\n*Hit the button (A)\" *YAAH*..... Oh.. I see... (A) is for attacks.. okeeey..\n*Hit the button (x)\" *Menu pops up* No ! *Back*\n*Hit (B)* *Nep: Jump like a kangerou!!!* xD okey cool. I dont really like that but.. hey.. I can jump at least..\n*do the tutorial* (its really quick and easy... I mostly just skipped everything Histy told me lol)\n[spoiler] *Moved a little bit and BAM its a visual novel again.. im like What? xD[/spoiler]\nMore tutorials and some bla bla, Now I just want  to FIGHT !\n*Move toward enemy* *Enemies on sight >:D* Imma hit them with my SLOW attack (A) *Getting closer to them !*\nAAAAAND *Hit (A)*... *Loading* .... What??...... The heck is this? .. well ok? '-'\n\n\nFirst battle sequance: \n*Tutorial* Oh shut up histy -.-\"\" *Skip, skip, skip*\nAll right Im ready to FIGHT !\n.. wait what is that UI? weird... OOOH I SEE Its like the old Final Fantasys OOOH !\nWell ok... ok.\n\nSo yah at first I didnt really \"enjoy\"(?) the game (not as I do now).\nBut after [spoiler] Zero dimension [/spoiler] The first chapiter I was Hooked AF !\nI just loved the first chapiter's story ! It was REALLY big for just a \"Chapiter\" omg XD\nEvery episode finish with [spoiler] Neptune in a TV station[/spoiler] and every time I was like shit... its already the end of the game? But after like 5-6 episiode 2h+ long each I was like... wow....... [b] Reminder that I skipped EVERY \"Text only\"\n scenes !![/b] The first episode was a blast.. seriously !\n\nIll end this review here, Ill might add more soon :)\nLet me know if its a good review or not, tell me what you dont like or like ^_^ Peace !", "timestamp_created": 1491344640, "timestamp_updated": 1499065577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

fan, I see Nep I buy. \n\nBut is the lattest game in series is still good? Is Nep still pudding? And does IF and Compa still have something to provide for those who love Gameindustri? Well, let's go through pros and cons:\n\nPros\n\n1) Story: VII puts a spin on a traditional formula of Neptunia games. Where previous were following chapter by chapter scheme, this time game separated in three diffrent stories, all connected by a global plot. Each story follows a certan charecter and her story in one of three dimensions (later in the game you can travel between them). Without giving away too much spoilers, let's just say that plots are quite entertaining, espechially for those who played this series for a while.\n\n2) Humor: Since VII provides new structure to plot telling, new charecters and refrences modern gameing as well as Dreamcast rise and fall... It does amazing job with making fun of todays console wars, trends and directions at wich gameindustry rolls, as well as simply being Neptastic in it's usuall well known way, After all most of us play this series for good laughs and this game provides them.\n\n3) Combat: Best in series. This time it's not a simpel as get best weapon, set best combos and just spam those or use all the best SP moves. This time, each weapon have a certan ammount of slots for combos, and many of them connect to each other in diffrent ways for crit hits, so you will have to chose between weapon with low dmg but a lot of combo slots, or strong dmg weapon wich hold less. But overall it's not far fetched from previous games, just a little tweak that makes combat more intresting. Another change was done to EXE meter, unlike Neptunia 1 and 2 -- you can't fill it in diffrent battles and later use to your advantage in tough fight, and unlike Neptunia VI it came back: still it's same good old EXE meter, when heroes or enemies  takes damage it will be filled, and player can use it to transform, unleash a devistating drive attack or use it for coordination. What is coordination? Well if you remember, in previous games, heroines could do double-overdrives, now player have ability to execute a moves with 3 or 4 heroines, if they present and set on field.\nFinaly we have so called Dark CPU bosses. Battles with them are diffrent from standart, but not much, you simply can not harm them with weapon and left with SP moves and coordination attacks, but the epicness is overwhelming.\n\n4) Music and Sound: Amazing! Although some of trecks in OST are remakes of other games, and while it's understandable with Spelunky (to which there's a two dungeons as a huge nod) then with Guilty Gear or Phantom Break (and correct me if I am wrong, but isn't \"Whirlpool of Insanity\" kinda sound like one of God Eater themes?) it feels outta place. Still even remakes are awesome.\n\nNeutral\n\n1) DLC: By themself it's same old same old, a wee bit of overpowered equip and some charecters. However DLC charecters do have their events, dialogues and they feel like they should've been in the game from the start. Although they wont provide anything story related, it's still feels like a sort of scam... Not mad, simply dissapointed at you IF and Compa.\n\n2) Random encounters on a world map. Random encounters on a world map Carl! Random encounters on a world map in modern JRPG! Well in NG+ you can turn them off, still very annoying, though not fatal and hey if you like 'em -- good for you.\n\n3) Endings. With no spoilers, fuck Normal Ending! Fuck it! Fuck it! Not very dark (this honor still belongs to Neptunia 2 and conquest ending) but my god it's sad, be aware. True ending is better, but it still fells quite depressing... I thought I played Neptunia not Tales of! But with all honesty, they both are strong endings and I put them in neutral section mostly because of subjective view.\n\nCons\n\n1) Short\n2) Auto-equip\n3) Many boring dungeons and enemy variety\n4) Hunting for secret treaures still sucks\n5) Scouts (just play and you will know the pain)\n\n\nFinal verdict? 8 Neps out of 10.

Published by Idea Factory International and Developed by Compile Heart.\n\nThis game comes with a lot of improvements. Such like graphics, cool looking dungeons, battle system, etc.\n\nNow lets look on to the pros and cons of the game.\n\nPros:\n-Better graphics(Compared to Re;Birth games).\n-New refreshing characters. Ireally like Uzume and the Gold Thirds.\n-An interesting story, also comes in three arcs. [spoiler]Frist arc, Zero Dimension Neptunia Z, tells you about Uzume and where she lived, Zero dimension. Second arc, Hyper Dimension Neptunia G, tells you about the CPUs lost the fight aganist the Gold Thirds and their nations got taken over. Third arc, Heart Dimension Neptunia H, tells you about Uzume's true identity, her memories and the \"real\" Uzume.[/spoiler]\n-The fresh new giant battles(Damn, this is probably my most favorite thing about the game).\n-Graphics settings. Now if your computer can't run this game properly, you can lower your settings instead of lower your resolution.\n\nCons:\n-Bad combo system. Instead of fully customized your combos. you got the limited of combo slots depending on the weapon you use. And also shi tty crits system that guranteed crits if last time you do rush, power ,standard, etc. which is bullsh it.\n-Dungeon routes. Who the hell think this is the good idea watching your damn character running around the world map to the dungeon you want to go into. Yes there is the speed up button but still annoying. Oh and also if you are lucky, you will encounter the moster along the way. Which is super annoying. Good thing you can disable these monsters along the way, ON THE SECOND PLAYTHROUGH.\n-Neplunker. This broken, almost unplayable platform mini-game is the most frustrating shi t in the whole fu cking game. You jump from thethe terrain that is only 30 centimeters difference, you dies. Even you did a succesful jump, you still dies. Why? BECAUSE THIS THING IS BROKEN AS FU CK.  And if Neplunker is not frustating enough. WE HAVE NEPLUNKER ZERO FOR YOU. EVEN MORE FRUSTATING, MORE BROKEN THAN THE NORMAL ONES.\n-Grinding for levels on this game is crap. You can't grind for shi t in this game. When you pass lvl.100 by constantly killing Giant Metal Dogoo, later you realized 10K EXP is not enough for grinding to lvl.999 unless you use Cheat Engine, like me.\n-DLC items. DLC characters and so on. Oh god please why the fu ck couldn't you put it all in the damn game. This is like you make it and cut it to sell seperately to get the $$$. This is nothing but microtransactions.\n-This game runs like crap on windowed and borderless. Frame stutter every 30 seconds.\n-Good story, awful ending. [spoiler]In the True Ending route, Uzume defeated Kurome, revived and return to Hyper Dimension and just say \"I'm back\". Like, her origin is from Zero Dimension, isn't she? The ending should to be in Zero Dimension. And just saying \"I'm back\", is this the best \"True Ending\" you've got? Story writter?[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, good game but these new mechanics just dumped down the game and make the game less fun than the Re;Birth games. Should you get it? Yes, but only on sale because the full price is not worth it for the game that is inferior to the previous games.", "timestamp_created": 1490016488, "timestamp_updated": 1490017176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518519", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30614673": {"recommendationid": "30614673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316798096", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492890084}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u809d\u4e863\u7ed3\u5c40\uff0c\u6211\u4e5f\u5feb\u53d8\u6210\u9ed1\u82bd\u4e86 \u9b3c\u6e38\u620f\u94b1\u771f\u7279\u4e48\u5237", "timestamp_created": 1489927752, "timestamp_updated": 1489927752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584831", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30583544": {"recommendationid": "30583544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298357281", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493705734}, "language": "english", "review": "Got it the day it came out.

As the latest installment in the series, Neptune V2 introduces even more new characters to its already massive cast, knowing full well that all we want are more waifus.\n\n1) Your favourite waifu gets more attention. \nThe story is structured in 3 arcs, with three separate conflicts that all tie together at the end. For the majority of the game, your party will only consist of 3-4 characters lead by one of the CPUs, and you waifu will likely get her own story at some point in the game. The consequence of this segmentation is that if you don't like one of the characters, you'll be forced to play her story.\n\n2) Gameplay is much better from previous installments. \nThe new combo mechanic is great, and smaller party sizes really makes you appreciate the stronger characters (Rom & Ram OP). You shouldn't have to grind at any point in the game since there are a lot of ways to boost your defense. (Idea chips). The removal of DPS checks also meant that you just have to max out your defense to beat the bosses (by DPS check I meant enemy regen at end of turn, so if you can't out DPS the regen you are pretty much done). \n\n3) New characters fill even more anime tropes. \nWe now have yandere, furyou, lolicon, dame otaku, etc. (Yes some male tropes too). Do know that not all of the above characters are fully developed, and some are just side characters. If you are like me though, more waifus are always better. The price you pay, though, is the lack of previous characters. (Plutia > Uzume)\n\nThere's some annoying details here and there, but overall Neptune V2 is a great waifu simulator. Because levels give you so much stats in this game, you can level your favourite waifu and actually feel like she's carrying the team (best grill confirmed). If you have not played this series at all, but want to get into it, I suggest the following play order: rebirth 1  -> rebirth 3 (V1) - > V2. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1489352071,

The story follows the adventures of the CPUs of Gamindustry, Neptune, Noire, Vert and Blanc as they once again struggle to save their nations from total destruction. What made this game different from the earlier release is the fact that it's not one, but three different games merged into one, and it takes place in three different dimensions as well.\n\nPros:\n\nImproved gameplay- One of the most notable features about this game is the improved gameplay mechanics and new elements such as the investment or the combos that, unlike earlier releases, won't let you spam the same attack over and over again, making you actually stop and think about what sort of combination of attacks you want. There's also the offensvie and deffensive stat boost granted by the support characters on the back that help you make your main four do more damage or become more resilient, and the challenges that will definitely make your favorite girls have an edge over the rest.\n\nA more serious, yet still funny story- Unlike earlier games, Megadimension follows a darker and more serious story, which is something many people (me included) found suprisingly pleasant. \n\nDon't worry about things getting too gloomy, though, because the protag of protagonists always makes sure to shove in one of her meta jokes and constantly keep you laughing like she always does. And the other CPUs won't fall behind in making you laugh either.\n\nAmazing soundtrack- One thing everyone can agree on with this game is that the soundtrack for this game was probably one of the best in the whole franchise. With calm and soothing tones that help you feel like you're just having a casual walk or battle songs that will make sure to pump you up for the upcoming battles.\n\nMonsters that look like real monsters- Remember those walking eggplants? Or the console shapped animals and pacman-like ghosts wandering around the dungeons? Well, you won't be seeing any of that here.\n\nInstead of the usually cute and comical monsters, this game introduces a new batch of enemies that look a lot more like proper monsters. From giant mutant turtles and gundamn-looking robots to demons and even giants taller than a skyscraper. No more fluffy dogoos and weird horse-bird hybrids, now you're dealing with the real deal.\n\nNew characters- Yet again, there's a whole new cast of characters, both ally and foe alike. And some of them ae just as erratic and hilarious as our all-time favorite girls\n\nCons:\n\nunsatisfying treasures- In the dungeons, you can get hidden treasures for fulfilling certain requirements. Unfortunately, though, these treasures can be rather unsatisfying or even dissapointing in comparison to the effort needed to fulfill some of these requirements.\n\nUnnecessarily difficult coliseum- One of the things many of us loved about the Nep games was the coliseum, an extra area aside from the story where you were free to choose from a list of pre-made battles and could fight to your heart's content without worrying about getting the game over screen even if you got defeated. And besides from having all sorts of amusing battles, you could always use it as a  quick way to farm some healing items or credits and do quick leveling. Unfortunately, this is not the case with Megadimension.\n\nThis time, the arena fights aren't very enjoyable. Enemies, even those in the lower lv requirements can be quite a pain to fight, and it's after reaching lv 200 when things get really annoying when fights used to start getting challenging at around lv 500 to 700 in earlier games. Most enemies take incredibly little damage or require a specific type of attack to even take damage at all (Dark Black, for example, won't take a single point of damage from anything except ice attacks, and even then her massive pool of health makes the fight painfully long and monotone) requiring you to be much more of a strategist than before, which is something not everyone enjoys\n\nAnother detail is the rewards being a one-time only reward. Things like rare accesories and weapons I get it if I can only get them once, but healing items and idea chips are something that could help a lot if they could be farmed, even if it's just to sell them for extra credits.\n\nMissing costumes and processors- One thing I couldn't help but notice after searching through every dungeon, quest and arena fight was that, while the CPU candidates had their maid, cosplay and idol costumes available, Neptune and the others didn't. And I'm not talking about DLC costumes here, I'm talking about the school and idol uniforms. Costumes that were always available without DLCs since Re;Birth 1. And yet, they're nowhere to be found\n\nAnd the core processors that appeared in Re;Birth 1 and 3 seem to be missing as well despite all their processor parts being available.\n\nI don't know if this was a mistake or something done on purpose, but that's just not okay.\n\nLevel grinding is frustrating- Along with some of the most unpleasant things found in this game, probably the second one to bother me the most was the insane EXP requirements. Reaching a high enough level to beat the game isn't that hard, and reaching level 99 is easy if you know about the big metal dogoo, but it's after hitting lv 99 when things get complicated, and it doesn't take long for them to get crazy either.\n\nUnlike before, the arena isn't really a choice for grinding for max level. So the big metal dogoo, which gives 10 million EXP per kill, quickly becomes the fastest way to grind. Getting to it isn't that hard once you get used to the dungeon, but what's really frustrating is the amount of times you need to fight it. Which rounds up around hundreds, if not thousands of times. And this process can be quite brain-numbing.\n\nNow I'm not one to judge how others do their game design, but when the fastest method to reach max level is having to kill the same enemy thousands of times (around 3000 if the discussions page is right) then i think it's time to take a moment and think things through a little bit more.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn all and all, Megadimension Neptunia VII is still a great game. It may have taken some bad decisions (Some of which could be fixed rather easily), but it improved over earlier releases in many ways and has by far one of the best stories in the franchise along with a clasic meta sense of humor that will appeal to both old-time fans and newcomers. If you're a Nep fan, then this game is a must-have, and even if you're not, then give it a shot, you won't regret it.", "timestamp_created": 1488503710, "timestamp_updated": 1488503710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723500", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30251989": {"recommendationid": "30251989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260641611", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498312378}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5c31\u8ba9\u6211\u5f53\u4e00\u4e2a\u840c\u8c5a\u5427", "timestamp_created": 1488332789, "timestamp_updated": 1513053255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30250123": {"recommendationid": "30250123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014640479", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511468054}, "language": "english", "review": "the V stands for VERY (good)", "timestamp_created": 1488323402, "timestamp_updated": 1488670943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529234", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30218940": {"recommendationid": "30218940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157250094", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1513473108}, "language": "english", "review": "[H1] Great game [/h1]\n", "timestamp_created": 1488199854, "timestamp_updated": 1488199854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.415537", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30208988": {"recommendationid": "30208988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042820843", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 10813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510731262}, "language": "english", "review": "A sequel to the third Neptunia game, this continues the story from the 2nd and 3rd game. Compared to past games, this one takes on a much darker tone in comparison to the rather bright scenery seen in the Hyper Dimension and Mega Dimesion; Zero Dimension has a more apocalyptic feel to it.\n\nGameplay remains somewhat the same, being a turn-based RPG, but with a few changes.\nFirst off, it would seem like the damage system has been changed a bit. When comparing damage from older games to this one, there's a rather significant drop in damage, more than 50% when attacking at similar levels. A new addition is the parts system when fighting enemies which provides opportunities to shift battles in your favor. A major addition to the battle system is the introduction of Dark CPU battles, which takes place on floating islands surrounding said Dark CPU. This slightly changes the battle mechanics, disabling the use of regular attacks and some skills, instead relying available skills and positioning.\n\nStorywise, this still follows the events of the previous games (aside from the first one) where several years have passed. Of course, this also follows the previous games in that multiple endings are available depending on what you do in the story. That aside, this game still finds room to crack jokes and references just like the previous games.\n\nThe soundtrack has many recycled ones, mainly during dialogs, but also has new ones to reflect the darker tone of this game. This also includes the random battles, which change depending on which dimension you're currently in, from the usual upbeat tone found in previous games (since the difference between Hyper and Mega Dimension was mainly time) to a slightly serious tone found in Zero Dimension. Boss battles use entirely new soundtracks, no longer using the ones from the previous three games while also reflecting the current progression in the story (generic boss battles do use the same one though).\n\nThis game also introduces more characters that reference various companies similar to IF and Compa from the previous games. Returning characters include the ever infamous Arfoire, the Compa-smitten Warechu, the lecturing Histoire, Financier (who initially appeared in Re;Birth1 and has returned with a similar role), and more. The game will also reference characters from the previous games.\n\nThe only complaint that I had was the change in the game's engine. Since this is NOT a remake and a direct port, performance drops are noticable.\n\nOverall, the game has quite a story to it, and for those who are new to the series, it is recommended to start from the second game (Re;Birth2) as the story is canon from there (the first game is not related to the events of the games after that), otherwise, newcomers will not get the references throughout the story.", "timestamp_created": 1488152470, "timestamp_updated": 1488152470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30184967": {"recommendationid": "30184967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344138432", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488079354}, "language": "english", "review": "i found this game to have so many faults and the keys are just ridiculous on pc \ni would suggest buying on ds or ps4", "timestamp_created": 1488080529, "timestamp_updated": 1488080529, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.347130", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30181185": {"recommendationid": "30181185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012704011", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 12096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496698268}, "language": "english", "review": "Well it all started with me wondering if I should get this game.

Don't worry, the game is still a comedy, and you'll still be laughing all the way through, but the narrative also goes to dark places, and there was a scene that genuinelly freaked me out. As a matter of fact, from the moment the playable part of the game starts, it's non-stop foreshadowning that \"oh God, this can only end in tears.\" In addition, the story pays several nods to the iterative experience that were the previous games/dimensions, which makes the experience feel even bigger.\n\nThe new character (Uzume Tenoboushi) is endearing and will win you over rather quick. The best parts of the writing, however, were probably Nepgear and Uni. The writers seem to have learned their lesson from the Sisters Generation fiasco, and this time they turned the little sisters into a great complement to the story: Gear is a decent Straight Man in the middle of the circus (and her deprotagonization is still occasionally played for laughs, but without bordering on being mean as it happened in Victory). Uni this time distinguishes herself from her sister in that, while Noire is the dependable public figure, Uni is the dependable person willing to make the hard choices softer-hearted people won't, in addition to possessing a wisdom that shines at times.\n\nGraphically speaking, Compile Heart seasoned their usual copypasta stew with enough new game assets to make it feel fresh (and they needed to, considering this game originally debuted on the PS4) as well as to keep it from being bullied by the other PS4 games after the 2K transition. The music is adequate, and conveys the narrative's theme of foreboding by toning down some of the more cheerful tunes, but still nothing to write home about (as it's usually the case with Neptunia games). There is a memorable track (namely, the one for fighting the dark CPUs), but sadly not enough to make me feel I should buy the soundtrack. The controls are basically more of the same thing, and if you're playing with a Steam Controller (as I did) you'll need to create your own control scheme as the default scheme will NOT work (look for the one I uploaded, that will get you through, and customize as needed if you want).\n\nWarning: The game cheats in that the new game+' second playthrough is basically mandatory. To get the True Ending, you must (among other things) have each nation end their segment with shares of 60% or more in the Neptunia G part, and without the extra money from your first playthrough, getting 60% in the Planeptune part is impossible (furthermore, Planeptunes' shares somehow drain during the other nations' parts, making it even harder to make the mark). Also, you won't be able to complete the Neplunker levels without Flag Items you only receive upon start a new game+. Still, the experience is enjoyable enough and I'm fairly certain you'll want to do that second playthrough [spoiler]if anything, because the Ascension ending will make you throw the controller and the screen and yell \"this cannot end like this!\"[/spoiler]\n\nThe best Neptunia game so far, and basically the \"ultimate\" one... which is both good and bad, because narrative-wise, that means that, under Neptunia's current formula, there's nowhere else they can go from here. Furthermore, it somehow feels like the series' conclusion once you take all factors into consideration. If the franchise is to keep thriving, it will need to break its mold and move to terra incognita (which is exactly what Four Goddesses Online feel like). Only time will tell whether Neptunia manages to succeed where most franchises have failed and are then been accused of jumping the shark.", "timestamp_created": 1486249881, "timestamp_updated": 1511424011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.644156", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29695232": {"recommendationid": "29695232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007887725", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 957, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486220711}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "very simple boring and childish game", "timestamp_created": 1486220809, "timestamp_updated": 1486220809, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29664511": {"recommendationid": "29664511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117938960", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 11126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512968220}, "language": "english", "review": "First Playthrough: This is a great, enjoyable game with an engaging storyline and amazing characters.

Oh and maybe how it constantly gives and takes characters in that first run.\nIn regards to Dev, it's cool, just.. wish it would be a little less tedious to do. You have to go out of your way to gather resources, and uh. While not necessary, annoying.

Con un mont\u00f3n de mejoras en todos los aspectos, sin duda no me extra\u00f1a que el t\u00edtulo haya hasta cambiado. Este juego es un juego que literalmente no querr\u00e1s acabar. Con una historia y banda sonora brutal, junto a gr\u00e1ficos muy mejorados, y un sistema de combate casi totalmente revisado, este juego es un ejemplo a seguir para muchos otros RPG.\n\n\nArgumento - 10 / 10\nSonido - 10 / 10\nGr\u00e1ficos - 10 / 10\nJugabilidad - 10 / 10\nDificultad - 9 / 10\nDiversi\u00f3n - 10 / 10\n\n\nLa historia sigue la historia de Re;Birth 3, pero en el sentido de que es casi una secuela del mismo. Puedes seguir jugando este juego sin haber jugado el anterior, pero yo recomiendo jugar al anterior nuevo, adem\u00e1s de que notar\u00e1s de primera mano todos los cambios introducidos. Con un argumento notablemente m\u00e1s largo y mucho m\u00e1s intenso (que si hubiesen querido podr\u00edan haberlo alargado incluso m\u00e1s, y yo muy feliz de ello), llega un momento donde te intriga tanto la historia que dejar\u00e1s de lado todo el contenido secundario para ver que es lo que pasa.\nNo solo eso, la m\u00fasica adem\u00e1s acentuar\u00e1 todo lo que la historia te retransmita, una banda sonora que querr\u00e1s comprar, ademas de todo el conjunto de nuevos efectos especiales que le da ese empuj\u00f3n final.\n\nLos gr\u00e1ficos son totalmente nuevos en todos los sentidos, tanto los men\u00fas como el dise\u00f1o de personajes tanto 3d como di\u00e1logos. Con un lavado de cara impresionante que le da un aspecto muy mejorado conforme al resto, considero este juego uno de los mejores en su estilo de gr\u00e1ficos/personajes.\nEl combate introduce un sistema de combos totalmente distinto, cada arma tiene distintos slots de combo, y los combos tienen efectos para encadenarlos y aumentar su efectividad. La barra \"EXE\" vuelve, y esta vez la forma HDD/Gold/NEXT usa EXE tambi\u00e9n. Nuevas transformaciones, las transformaciones NEXT, y ataques en formaci\u00f3n son otras de los nuevos comandos que podr\u00e1s usar en combate. Todos los nuevos detalles conseguir\u00e1 enamorarte de este sistema de combate por turnos.\n\nLa dificultad tambi\u00e9n es acorde a la saga, si te quedas atr\u00e1s en equipo o nivel lo pasar\u00e1s muy mal. Los personajes de DLC son bastante potentes y si adquieres alguno bajar\u00e1 esta dificultad de forma notable, pero el juego seguir\u00e1 siendo disfrutable.\nEn general, una entrega que te va a tener enganchad@ durante horas sin parar hasta que te lo acabes y te arrepientas de ir tan r\u00e1pido a por la historia. Una obra de arte.\n\n\nCalificaci\u00f3n final - 10 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1485425623, "timestamp_updated": 1485425623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29496715": {"recommendationid": "29496715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076697211", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490449247}, "language": "english", "review": "Megadimension Neptunia VII is mechanically superior to the previous titles, has much better graphics and animations than the previous titles, has higher quality writing in its story, and the soundtrack is god tier. \n\nI was getting sick of the near copy-paste games Neptunia was making and was hesitant to grab this one, but I was so relieved upon playing it to discover that it's a genuinely good game with much higher quality than its predecessors.

For the first time in the series, the story is so lame and boring that it was hard to gather the enthusiasm to continue. It was a series of nonsensical and irrelevant things strung together to fill screen time.\n\nFrom the utter irritation of the game constantly switching/removing your equipment (gasp!) to dropping the Plutia/Iris Heart character from the last game because she was too gross, it's one bummer after another. The new characters are awful, especially Uzume/Orange Heart. Dreamcast CPU  - she was as lame as the real Dreamcast console, indeed. The other new characters (with inexplicable names like C-Cha, S-Sha, E-Sha and B-Sha (!!!)) are as annoying as they are ugly to look at. If you like anyone but Neptune and Nepgear after this game, you're a bigger fan than I am. This is a letdown of massive proportions for all the wrong reasons. Also, it does the worst Neptunia trope of all time ALL THE TIME: \"Oh, this is a different time/dimension/whatever, so I don't know you.\" Every character re-meets every character constantly. It's insufferable. Nice way to throw away all the character relationships from previous games or AN HOUR AGO.\n\nPROS: Voice acting (Melissa Fahn as Neptune is *amazing*). Great game performance and framerate. Lots of options. Lots to see and do if you like that. Music is great. Battle system is the same as before: turn-based and fast.\n\nCONS: Story. New characters. Level design. Missing the danger/conflict from previous games and making everything into an unfunny joke. Strangely rife with spelling/grammar mistakes (lying/laying, its/its) that I don't recall in previous games.\n\nBuy the anime instead.

My rating is a 9.5/10. Performance issues aside, this game is amazing and you should buy it if you are a Nep fan and have played all other games before this. If you are new to this series, then play all the other games first to see if it's your type of game, then buy this.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe story is what you would expect from a Nep game, funny but it does have it's serious moments (though most of the time Neptune breaks the mood). This time, the Story is branched out into 3 arcs and is a lot longer than the previous games.\n\n[h1] Characters [/h1]\nThe characters introduced in this game are extremely interesting and well developed as the game progresses. I don't think there is [u]ONE[/u] new character that I don't like. My favorite new characters are Uzume and C-Sha.\n\n[h1] OST [/h1]\nSome familiar tracks return like $100 and Minicar but the new ones that are introduced in this game are amazing, my favorite being More soul and Soutaisei Vision. If you have not bought the soundtrack yet, please do because this is some of the best music I have heard in my life.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nIf you have played the main Nep games before (Re;Birth 1, 2, 3) then the gameplay is almost the same, except there are a couple of changes. For one, there is no more Guard Points, but some enemies have parts that reduce damage, but can be broken if hit from a specific direction. EXE drives that use multiple characters now requires them to be in a certain position (circle, triangle) before you can use them. One thing that I dislike about the gameplay are the keyboard controls. In the previous games, I had no problem with them, but in this game they are horrible. If you own a controller, please, use that instead of the keyboard, will save you a lot of frustration.\n\n[h1] Performance [/h1]\nWhile I don't have problems with performance (except for movies, which happen to a lot of people) a lot of other people do. Some people have huge lag, graphical glitches or crashes. I think this is the biggest fault of the game on PC. Idea Factory should do a lot more testing before releasing this to Steam. They do release patches which fix some problems, but it is really frustrating to have to wait for them before playing the game properly.\n\nHope this helped you guys, have fun Nepping!", "timestamp_created": 1484440837, "timestamp_updated": 1484508699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29247249": {"recommendationid": "29247249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189409606", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483988261}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Game of the Series .\nPros :\n- Amazing Story with a lot of parodies .

The only thing that surprises me are those beef-ish system requirements to get the game running at it's best graphical fidelity considering the fact that the game is comprised mainly of cartoonish 3d worlds, models, and effects, but it shouldn't bother you too much because you the only thing you sacrifice by tuning down those video settings are battle effects, which are probably one of Neptunia's distinctive eyecandies from other JRPGs apart from their funny, memorable and relatable characters.\n\nThe gameplay itself is good for an RPG as a whole. Exploring dungeons can be fun, some are rediculously huge, some can be quite confusing to cruise around, and some are just plain awesome! Battles are turn-based, but they do have movement during those turns which can be used to strategically carry out combos and plays.  Tons of cute outfits and weapons for all characters are available (Look at kawaii little neppy -w-) with varying statistical advantages, crafting, and even investments! There are so much to list that I'm sure you'll really want to figure out for yourself at this point if you're truly interested in the game.\n\nI think the true selling point of this game are its characters and artwork. I mean these each of the four CPU's (Neptune, Noire, Vert, and Blanc) are memorable, cute, funny,  Each 4 vary so much that many people take to liking one of them and possibly not so liking the other, but it all comes down to preference. The artworks are all well drawn, evident in the game's lively, colorful environment and CG gallery. The voice actors all did a great job of doing voice overs for each characters, too! It really helps bring out the unique flavor of each character in the game...\n\nI'd recommend it, no doubt.

latest entry was something I looked forward to a good deal. The franchise returns yet again at full power. Detailed and very polished art, a pleasing and relatively varied soundtrack as well as cute and funny characters. These are things that Neptunia has always had in spades and the bar was raised even further here.\n\nThis time around some changes were made to the series' gameplay. Now the amount and type of attacks you can use in a combo will depend on your equipped weapon. There was also an even bigger emphasis placed on the difference in the attack types. Rush attacks will generate by far the most energy for your special attacks bar, while power attacks produce very little energy but inflict more damage. \n\nUnfortunately, these differences do not play out very well in practice. Although not as quickly apparent as in previous games, the best strategy in combat is still to have one or two characters constantly use rush combos to generate energy for the remainder of the party to exhaust on special attacks. Another mechanics change that Compile Heart most likely introduced to combat this was to let the player score guaranteed critical hits on their enemies if they used combo skills in a certain order, often mixing in all three types of basic attacks. The issue is that the special attack gauge is far more important than the small amount of damage you do with combos, thus making the change largely irrelevant in important fights. \n\nThe above being said, those negatives are not necessarily very detrimental to the game. The combat is still fun, if mostly a stat check. I do however want to talk about two issues that I firmly believe are more of a problem.\n\nFirstly, the story's way of intertwining with the gameplay is too predictable. When you complete the first part of the game, you are given a choice of which goddess' story arc you would like to play next. Eventually you must go through all four of the main characters stories before being able to proceed to the story's final stage. The first goddess' story arc, whichever one you choose based on your personal preference, will most likely be enjoyable. But it is when you must play through the other three stories that predictability hampers the enjoyment. The gameplay setup is similar each time: You play with two or three characters through a number of dungeons before fighting a different variation of the same boss that showed up in the other story arcs. You inevitably end somewhere around the same level each time. \n\nThe reason it's not particularly fun to play through is that you realize the game is asking you to do the same thing four times in a row, except with slightly different characters. If you enjoy the story this might be fine, but gameplay wise I think this is something that should be strongly avoided.\n\nAs a final negative point I want to tackle in this review I would like to mention costume variety. The game's primary characters have a number of equippable costumes. But the actual amount of different clothing designs are staggeringly few. On display are simple recolours and copies of outfits that appeared many times already previously in the series. There's very little new content in this area which is a big disappointment. The potential for wacky, cute or interesting costumes is a good fit with the Neptunia universe and it is a shame to not see that realized as well as it could be.\n\nI understand that I have mostly focused on what I find negative as that is my tendency. However I still very much recommend the game, perhaps especially so to newcomers. In terms of graphics, soundtrack, dungeon variety and gameplay no other game in the series has managed better than this one.", "timestamp_created": 1483996665, "timestamp_updated": 1483997501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29144608": {"recommendationid": "29144608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085553930", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511174800}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah....

If possible, could we get a skip enemies button when moving around the map? No need to skip the trip when you go to places (example: from Planeptune to Lastation/Lowee)\n- I feel like you should add more wallpapers in the DLC Deluxe pack.\n- When you create a new DLC person, could we get a cool weapon for her too? You can make it DLC if you really need that 1 $/\u20ac/\u00a3.. I would really love to see new weapon while using Million Arthur, God Eater & Nitroplus :3\nBtw where is swimsuits for some people? like Nepgear in that Swimsuit DLC?

About 10 of them, of which all are likeable, perfectly realized, and relevant to the story. Uzume quickly became one of my favorite characters in the franchise and she's just awesome. Both new and returning characters are given lots of time to (exclusively) interact with one other and the relationships between them are clearly defined aside from ones I made up myself via Lily Rank. All characters are humanized past their stereotypes just enough and nobody takes a backseat to the main plot. Voice acting is great on everyone's part (especially Uzume), and they're all cute in their own ways, [strike]which is half the reason you're playing this anyway right?[/strike]\n\nThe story takes place throughout 3 dimensions and is divided into segments with an underlying plot that ultimately connects everything together. The story also maintains a good sense of urgency whenever it's relevant and does something pretty awesome (twice) into the game where it branches out as multiple events occur at the same time, and you get to see everyone doing their own thing i.e. contributing in their own ways. It keeps things current, interesting, and doesn't allow for as much downtime as the previous games.\n\nAnother thing about the story is that it feels more personal, and I can't get into that without spoiling the underlying plot. A lot of people may disagree with me on this, but the main villain is well developed as a character (especially compared to previous games) and makes way for a few touching and appropriately hilarious moments towards the story's last act. It's still severely flawed in the way that it's cheesy with many very arbitrary plot conveniences and seemingly too crazy ideas, but [b]I still like it[/b]. Sue me.\n\nSpeaking of previous games, this is pretty disconnected apart from the many returning characters, but the game expects you know them already so it still doesn't really make for a good entry point to the series. There's no mention of the Ultradimension, nor the remains of both ASIC and the Seven Sages, so don't expect to see Peashy, Rei, Pururu or CFW Magic here. The game has better sprites (and backgrounds) and visual fidelity in dungeons, though I did experience framerate drops in world maps. It has better balance between random/irrelevant and contextual humor, and is still endlessly garnished with 4th wall breaking, [b]fanservice[/b], and pop culture references as well as subtle commentary about the gaming industry, [i]or maybe I'm just looking too much into it.[/i]\n\nGameplay is a bit better I guess(?), I never really liked the dungeon crawling in the first place. I like the new investment system, the Sharing Field battles, formation skills, scouting system and the especially [i]glorious[/i] fast-forward button for battles (and almost everything else really). Grinding in a Nep game has never been easier (still very tedious though). Anyway, they're awesome [i]for a while,[/i] but these mechanics feel very underutilized and I ended up not using a lot of them in the end, much like the previous games. Development is mostly unnecessary, Sharing Field is just spamming skills, disc development doesn't have enough impact, so on and so forth, and these things seem to cater to hardcore gamers--which I am not--and offers little to no incentive otherwise aside from prolonging playtime via micromanagement.\n\nMegadimension Neptunia is a Neptunia game on every level, rest assured if you've played any of the previous ones then you know what's coming. That said, I find this one to have the most interesting story and characters, and that kept me engaged for longer in comparison. Production quality in general seems much improved but gameplay is still lacking for a filthy casual like me. Game's not revolutionary, it still cheesy, cliche'd, and very lighthearted, [b]but it's still pretty damn fun.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1483500439, "timestamp_updated": 1483500439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28984278": {"recommendationid": "28984278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286585097", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504245250}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6d77\u738b\u661f\u5c31\u662f\u4fe1\u4ef0\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1483469631, "timestamp_updated": 1483469631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503131", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28982019": {"recommendationid": "28982019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065762893", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1965, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499797324}, "language": "french", "review": "Ce jeu est vraiment tr\u00e8s bien, d\u00e9j\u00e0 le faite de s\u00e9parer le jeu en \"arc\" est un tr\u00e8s bon point ! \nLes skills sont vraiment beau et l'histoire est bien ! \nLa forme Orange Heart est vraiment belle ! \nVraiment un bon jeu ! \n", "timestamp_created": 1483464283, "timestamp_updated": 1483464283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28978506": {"recommendationid": "28978506", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065753122", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 9760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483422585}, "language": "english", "review": "Nothing has changed much. It\u2019s still the same JRPG that got the same game systems working in the background as the Re;Birth branded titles. But there are enough changes here that seem to rebalance those systems, so much that the game as a whole resulted in being a more refined, more tactical and once again enjoyable gaming experience.\n\nFor the 4rd time you play as teenage girls having an adventure by progressing the story trough reading VN-Events, by visiting dungeons, fighting monsters and collecting items. With story being a big focus of the game again, the writers finally found the middleground between the too serious written Re;Birth2 and the over the top hilarious humour of Re;Birth3. The girls act surprisingly close to their characters this time which works in favour of story progression. Dialogs no longer sidetrack into what seemed like endlessly going on walls of texts with bad jokes.\n\nWhat are the most interesting additions to the gameplay now? Stella\u2019s Dungeon is no more. Scouts are now implemented into the maingame and can add certain bonuses to the dungeons you visit. Higher Droprate, Monster Change, more EXP, less Credits, etc. You also no longer just warp between Nations on the overworld map. Instead you have to walk along a path with random encounters between Dungeons and Points of Interest. The Investment system is a great addition too: You can upgrade each nation thus adding more items to the shops, to find additional scouts or to increase the nation\u2019s shares.\n\nCombat is tighter than ever! Bye bye 9999 damage! The Guard Break System got removed. Combos now consist of Standard, Power and Rush attacks that activate combo bonuses when specific criteria are met, like \u201cdidn\u2019t used power\u201d, \u201clast attack was rush\u201d and so on. Each weapon starts out with one of those three attack types and combos need to be set up according to their combo bonuses for maximum damage effect. There is also a higher priority on items now because status effects occur more frequently.\n\nWhat\u2019s not so good about the game? No NewGame+ or Endgame content! Re;Birth3 had up to 2 hours more VN-events to watch and more dungeons with worthwhile loot to offer. Victory II does not. You can level up your characters to level 999 again but with only a single mob available to you that gives 10million EXP. To reach the golden 999 the game requires you to fight this single mob over 5000 times or more. Not an elegant solution.\n\nThe character DLCs are great because they add new characters with their very own VN-Events and story. The downside is that those characters are so overpowered that they break the tight balance of the game. My advice, use them in NewGame+. Weapon and Item DLCs include even more content to break the balance while Nightwear and Bikini DLC just add cosmetic changes.\n\nVictory II is a tight game, even more so without the use of DLCs. The characters are loveable and the humour marvelous. Expect lots of anime tropes and popculture references. Don\u2019t regret buying if you love anime, JRPG\u2019s or cute girls doing cute things.\n\nAward Update", "timestamp_created": 1483456514, "timestamp_updated": 1511559653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502351", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28968622": {"recommendationid": "28968622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011270411", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 1585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486300424}, "language": "english", "review": "When you actually get to play the game its fun.

Seeing that it was on sale and had such a sheer amount of positive reviews, I took the plunge on this one. Needless to say, I became an instant fan within minutes of playing. Gameplay wise, the battle system is fun, easy to learn, and much better with a controller. Neptune and the gang are funny, loveable, and have made an artform of fourth wall breaking. It's basically an over the top visual novel in game form and it works on every level. The best part is that Idea Factory made it so the characters and game world are explained in detail so people that haven't played the series can start with the latest and greatest.\n\nMy experience thus far? 10/10\n\nOn a side note, I would take the negative reviews about crashing and stability with a grain of salt. I'm using an older NVidia GeForce GTX 750 ti on Windows 10 with the most recent drivers and haven't experienced any of the issues people have posted thus far up to the second story. I've also seen people complaining about controller issues, but again, zero issues using a wired Xbox 360 controller. From what I've read, the stability/crashing seems to happen at random points in the game with no warning so I'll be on the look out.

"english", "review": "To preface, I already played through this around 50~ hours on another system, didn't reach the end but got pretty damn near close so, here goes.\n\nThis is easily the best neptunia game to date, it plays better than the previous titles, the story is better, the soundtrack is god tier, and I'd rank it above any other jrpg I've played to date. The PC port of this game is marvelous (atleast for my system, I have encountered no issues so far, Windows 10-64 bit, Nvidia GTX 860m, Intel i7-4710hq processor, 8 gb ram, using a Steam Controller with xinput.)...\n\nSo, The game itself, this is a sequel to V Generation, or http://store.steampowered.com/app/353270/?snr=1_7_15__13\n\non steam. It takes place a few years after, so while it helps to have knowledge of the previous games (namely, sister generation and V generation,) it's not required and you can easily get into the game without knowledge of those. The story knows how to take itself seriously, though most of the time you're going to have comedic parody and fun moments, the soundtrack is perfect for the serious times, just as it is for the fun, and honestly the best soundtrack to any JRPG I've played so far,(seriously, recommend that digital deluxe just for the soundtrack if nothing else.) and as a visual novel I'd definitely rank it in my top 5 for story especially with how it ties in to the previous games. (order without megadimension pretty much being steins;gate>grisaia series>clannad series>tsukihime, not sure where it'd fit in, it could easily be a #2 slot after steins with the sheer amount of fun it is, the epic soundtrack and what not.) \n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, you set your characters combo skills for battle (as in when they're doing their chain of attacks, which order they come up in and what moves for what type of attack, which is important as when you make a chain of abilities they can have combo traits which boost the power of the move if it meets the condition allowing you to clear enemies faster, and sometimes giving you that small edge you needed to defeat a boss), usable skills for buffs, special techniques, transformations and the like which all are required for the more difficult content, this game has a pretty decent difficulty curve and finally feels like a true jrpg game, while the other neptunia games were fun for the story, they weren't all that great for the gameplay itself; though if you liked that gameplay, you will LOVE this.(especially love how [spoiler]when you transform in battle, depending on the highest level of transformation used in that battle, for example HDD form has its own special soundtrack and NEXT form has its own special soundtrack, that soundtrack will keep playing until the battle ends which allows you to turn epic battle music on at will with the transformations.[/spoiler]) \n\nThe in-game cutscenes and character animations are all well done, crisp, and look great, character personalities are all varied and you have your typical cliches, but the way they're written is very well done from my view, and this game is worth multiple playthroughs, when you new game+ you keep all your previous characters and equipments and what not, so that you can hop right back in and try to get that true ending on your next playthrough or whatever floats your boat, since I think this game is good enough to play again just for the gameplay itself.\n\nFurthermore, to add on to visuals, the visuals in the fight for an anime-style jrpg are fantastic, the special moves and combos are fun to watch and truly look devastatingly powerful, the transformation sequences look great, and I can't think of any improvements off the top of my head that I'd ask for, again, considering the art style and direction this game took I believe they fully utilized what they could to achieve the look they were hoping for.\n\nFanservice, as always, is plenty, and I don't just mean that typical fanservice, I mean references to nearly every major game/anime/movie you can think of done in amazing ways, the first encounter of the game is a [spoiler]digimon[/spoiler] reference even, and while a lot are pretty subtle, they do some of the bigger mentions in amazing reveals and if you have an extensive knowledge of current and past mainstream culture(even some small ones make it in there) you'll have a great time catching and picking out all the references, and that alone affords multiple playthroughs of scrutinizing the text so that you have an Aha! moment and realize what it was referencing.\n\nOverall, as a neptunia game, and a jrpg, I give this game a solid 10/10, for me, at least, I'd be hard pressed to find a better jrpg that's currently out, maybe later, but for now this is my top game for that genre.",

glitches, lag, errors, controller mapping difficulties, camera disfunctions, quality issues and the lot. This game has so far been virutally unplayable. I have close to two hours registered \"playing\" the game, and its all been dedicated to trying to fix this garbage. Its a shame that this game can't even play its opening video cutscene, or get a line of dialogue in the visual novel aspect without a five second long pause. \n\nControls:\nThe amount of buttons on this game is insane as its obviously a direct port from PS Vita. Except unlike good ports, it doesn't even tell you what the buttons are supposed to really do, in other words, it doesn't translate a ps vita keyboard to a pc keyboard. Furthermore, they decided to not let you use the mouse to rotate the camera, but you are forced to use the keyboard, using 4 extra buttons. I found its easier to play with a contorller than the keyboard, since it has more buttons to use than fucking warcraft. But even the camera, no matter what I do, no matter what button I assign to the controller, will not stop the camera from rotating. When I plugged in my controller from my PS4, I still had to rework out the buttons as the one assigned either went directly to a button that made no sense (i.e. What would be used as the L2 Button was assigned as left x axis down or something like that). Then I would have problems where I would want to assign one button to a control that was already being used. So instead of the game reverting that previously used button to blank, it would just share it. So at one time, both Yes and No responses were on the same button, and would have the same effect. I had to rework around this, going back to my pc keyboard, thne going back to controller, then reworking (somehow) the default option so that I had to restart the entire mapping process. Kill me.\n\nVideo:\nThe video cutscene look really cool, its a shame that they work for ten seconds before scratching and lagging out, also, the audio follow that too. Toi fix it, I tried to dimish the quality of the game, disable V-Sync and other buttons, switch from window to fullscreen to boarderless - all to see if I could actually play the videos. Eventually, I gave up. It wasn't going to work. Whenever the game has its VN aspect, no matter what setting you put it on, the character will just wait ten seconds before making another line of dialogue. They just stare at you with their weird slowly blinking cartoon faces.\n\nAudio:\nThe audio doesn't seem to be too bad, whenever it fails, its still in sync with the video since thats lagging too.\n\nStory:\nHa! If I could even experience the story, I would let you know how it went. But the idea of having the different arcs as different games or something sounds interesting. I just wish I could actually play it.\n\nOverall:\nThis was depressing, I am a huge fan of the series, I own the original three games, not the rebirth remakes. They're all on PS3. I do own MegaTagmensional Blanc + NepNep vs Zombie on PC. It has similiar control problems, espcially the pathetic conversion from PSVita to PC. But the video and gameplay worked fine. I assume that maybe a more powerful computer could handle the problems I faced with my game, but I own a Surface Pro 3, and it handled the Zombies game fine, so why shouldn't this?\n\nAt this time I am still reseaching how to fix the 10 trillion problems I faced in this game, but no article or help guide seems to fix the problems. I'm currently considering just returning the game and refunding my money. As a player, I deserve to be able to play the game as it should be intended, and not have to rewire my whole hard drive to accomidate for the kusoge game.", "timestamp_created": 1482891880, "timestamp_updated": 1482891880, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.381953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28731810": {"recommendationid": "28731810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074962351", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511828657}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente Juego con mejores capacidades y graficas a las versiones anteriores nada que decir aun sin perder su esencia en combate, lectura, en conclusion fue muy mejorado a las sagas anteriores y por mucho...", "timestamp_created": 1482883118, "timestamp_updated": 1511828475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28729146": {"recommendationid": "28729146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157331905", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497034383}, "language": "french", "review": "Il faut dire ce qui est.

and was heading back to the basillicom, she found a strange broken game console, upon her arrival, her and Nepgear attempted to fix up, but the power buttons opens up a portal to a new dimension, after travelling in said dimension, Neptune and Nepgear find Uzume Tennouboshi, the two then learn that like themselves, Uzume is a CPU, named Orange Heart, the two also learn that they're in the Zero dimension, and that Uzume fights against the 4 dark CPUs, giants the size of a skyscraper, Nep and Gear then swear to help Uzume while finding a way back home to their dimension.\n\nVII follows the core Neptunia battle system with some minor variations, your weapons now affect what attacks you can pull off, in addition, some attacks have combo potential, meaning that if executed in the proper order, you will be guaraunteed to pull of serious damage rather than spamming the same buttons, the EXE bar also fills up faster but is not stored after battles, some enemies and bosses have parts that must be broken to deal more damage, when said part is broken, you gain more EXP and credits\nVII also introduces random encounters on a grid-styled map system, these can be turned off after completing the game once should you decide to do a NG+\n\nThe main cast of the Neptunia franchise is still here and in full force, Uzume is a right-round blast of a character, showing off her cool side while occasionally becoming her valley girl self, there's also Umio, the most gentlemanly fish-man you will ever see, and Adult Neptune, The Neptune that didn't become a CPU in the Ultradimension, replacing the maker characters of the past games is the new \"Gold Third\", consisting of K-sha: a yandere soldier, C-sha, a hunter who wants to do the people good, B-sha who likes credits but also uses her Presto mask persona to fight crimes, and S-sha, who has a severe case of the \"not interested\"\n\nOverall: VII is a great addition to Neptunia, but in order to understand some of the plot points, you must have some knowledge of Re;birth2 and Re;birth3, else some plot points may leave you questioning it", "timestamp_created": 1482776089, "timestamp_updated": 1482776089,

hard to recommend it based on performance alone.\n\nThe game is severely unstable in the sense that crashes are frequent and random. Not sure if the game has issues with certain hardware configurations (my specs are far above and beyond what a game like this could ever require) or doesn't play well with certain pieces of software, but either way the problem is legitimate and support from the developer appears to be non-existent. \"Solutions\" are out there, but none have worked for me personally.\n\nI literally spend more time hoping I reach a save point before I lose too much progress from a crash than I do actually enjoying the game.\n\nThe game itself seems fine. I like the combat systems, the art direction, and the soundtrack. The story, while pretty whimsical, is entertaining enough - though the writing is beyond fucking cheesy. I want to recommend it, but tbh all I can really say is buy at your own risk... the game may or may not run correctly on your hardware and you may just end up with the frustrating experience of being unable to enjoy the game you want to enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1482648257, "timestamp_updated": 1482648257, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498203",

Don't give it a second thought. Probably the soundtrack too.\n\nDon't know much about the series, but think it looks interesting?\nI'll tell you my experience and try to help you make up your mind. (I assume since you're here the anime aesthetic doesn't bother you.)\n\nI bought this game around the time it came out on steam for a similar price to what it is at now, during the winter sale, selling much of my DotA/CS:GO inventory to make the purchase. I had played about half (I think) of the first game, watched about half of the anime series, and bought the second game but never played it. My reason for not finishing the first game was that it was too grindy. I didn't really know what I was getting into. The characters were fun, but the gameplay was repetitive, and a lot of the mechanics weren't clearly explained (elemental damage). The only thing that matters from that prior experience is the familiarity with the characters, and even then this game does a decent job of re-introducing everyone, although there will be a few jokes or references to things that I and you may not get. That doesn't really detract from the experience.\nWhat this game did was improve greatly on the actual battles (in my opinion) and made it so that much less grinding was required to beat the bosses. If you just naturally fought any enemies that you met, you would almost always be sufficiently leveled for the big encounters. The combo mechanic for your attacks makes your choice for moves and weapons more interesting and intuitive. The story is very engaging, and you get to spend some quality time with all of the major characters. The normal end was very good, and the story built up to it very well. The \"true end\" achieved by doing a couple of specific things earlier in the story, which you'll probably have to look up to do properly, is an amazing conclusion. Once you beat the story, there is a seemingly unlimited amount of gameplay to be had completing quests and doing battles.\n\nI think this game would make a good introduction to the neptunia franchise, and highly reccomend it at its winter sale price, I wouldn't have minded paying full price for it originally if I knew what I was getting.", "timestamp_created": 1482440584, "timestamp_updated": 1482440584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.650137", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28530416": {"recommendationid": "28530416", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099027588", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487691493}, "language": "english", "review": "I see noire, i give good review", "timestamp_created": 1482421090, "timestamp_updated": 1482421090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451519", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28519639": {"recommendationid": "28519639", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998140916", "num_games_owned": 397, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 2156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 66, "last_played": 1513659834}, "language": "english", "review": "Adult Neptune will find me, knock me out and drag me to another dimension if I say I don't recommend this game.

This can even happen to some users with AMD cards, from reports on the forum.\n- The game is horribly optimized and will also crash many integrated Intel GPUs that are otherwise more than capable of running the game, in particular one long dungeon very early in the game called Sakura Park.\n- The game is lacking a Japanese-only balance patch that fixes glaring oversights regarding the game's combat system and scaling, namely with activated skills and EXE drives (aka. hypers) falling off into complete uselessness past the early game.\n- There is frequent stuttering and delay within the menus that can lead to crashes, especially with one of the graphics cards mentioned above. One of the July patches that IFI released helped the problem and made the stuttering far less noticeable, but it still happens.\n\nHowever, the abandonment of this game by the devs is particularly concerning, as IFI has done this once in the past. A previous game in the series, Neptunia Re:Birth2, saw IFI completely drop support for it while the game suffered from constant crashes, rolled back several problematic attempted fixes, and then did nothing for the rest of the game's lifespan. It still has not been patched.\n\nOverlooking the problems, Neptunia VII is a surprisingly good RPG with a long and indepth (if silly and whimsical) storyline, decent humor, and moderately challenging fights.

I'll update it if something changes?\n\n--NEP REVIEW PART 2: ATTACK OF THE ROBO GE-GES--\n\nOkay, so now I've cleared my first run of the game and can say a bit more. Even on a regular ending, the plot was quite enjoyable! I liked a lot of the jokes and references the game makes, some were unexpected.\n\nThe difficulty never ramped up, it actually got much easier, haha. If you use the scouting system strategically (AKA you put the experience booster wherever you are) you level up far above what's required through a little grinding. That said, I greatly appreciate the ability to fast forward/skip battle animations, with how easily my party of waifus obliterated foes battles would take literally a handful of seconds. Combine that with certain characters and their abilities and you're able to tank through dungeons with barely any problems as long as you pay attention.\n\nGot to NG+ where you can literally bring everything over progress wise (including all your end game party members unlocked from the beginning!!) so I can unlock the true ending, and they hand you all sorts of bonuses to make your second run faster, I can already tell. Props that they make multi-runs accessible, now I can dig into the other systems of the game I basically ignored without having to trudge through the game again. Smart thinking!\n\nFinal-Final thoughts are it's not a particularly challenging RPG for those willing to bite down deep with its systems, but it is a particularly-outstandingly fun one. I did feel like my goddess-like (CPU humor!) power was the result of my own planning, so I was proud of my first run. Totes fun, ya'll. Oh, and it took me 34 hours to clear the game due to super-over-levelling at the end. (Hint: The colosseum is an amazing grind spot for EXP and money, I leveled 6 times in an hour)\n\n--Original Review from 19 Hours in--\n\nNep's been my closet enjoyment for the last couple of years since deciding to try it from watching my friend get the first remake of Re;birth 1, and this is the one I can definitively say is what you want out of the series. I'll admit that when I played the first few in the Re;birth series I liked the concept of the world and its characters, but that the game flow (primarily being so attached to the guild quest structure) didn't feel very cohesive. Re;birth 3 started getting better, and now we've got this one on our hands. It's finally clicked!\n\nMaybe it just took me multiple games, but now all the systems the game has in place makes sense. You'll get the hang of the attack combo system, investing in your nations, and grinding your way to (as of now!) powering a hole into those bosses. The writing is getting better with each entry too, and the VAs really give their perfomances a lot of heart for something like this (I'm a bit biased towards my lord waifu Nepgear, but ya know).\n\nIf you're someone like me, getting past the fan service hurdles can be some mental hopskotch, but there's nothing quite like mashing your way through that obligatory bath shot still screen to avoid family judgment while still trying to comprehend what's being said. Keeps you on your toes!\n\nTL;DR the jokes are better, references are abound, and gameplay is totally up to snuff. Judgment by your friends and love ones can be healed with time and acceptance towards your strange, new hobby and you'll be all the better for it.", "timestamp_created": 1481069467,

The main menu interface. In my opinion, the main menu in this game isn't as good as the main menu in other Neptunia series. The other series have more friendly, elegant, and more enticing interface main menu.\n2. The animation. Hard to describe about this one. But this point is the most disappointing one that make me disappointed.\n3. The backsong. i feel that the backsong in this game is not as pretty and enticing as backsong in the other neptunia series. Especially the victory backsong.\n4. Last point, Neptune's voice.

Actually, great, even.\nFinishing my first playthrough of the game took me roughly 55 hours; that was taking it fairly leisurely, unlocking this and that that wasn't absolutely necessary for the first playthrough and goofing around now and then. After that, there's still the \"true\" ending, which leads to a post-game segments during which you can clean up any bits and pieces you didn't finish off first time around - Or trophy hunt. \nWell, at first, I want to say that I think this is Compile Heart's finest work to date. While there are some technical issues regarding frame drops in a few places, most of them are not really all that significant. Ignoring some typos, the script and translation are both excellent, the gameplay is enjoyable, smooth and well-balanced. The first and last points there adress two of the biggest criticism the Neptunia series has had ever since its release - technical issues regarding atrocious framerates that weren't really justifiable for the kind of game they were, and balancing issues regarding inconsistent or just way too easy difficulty. MegaNep counters both of these problems: It runs at pretty consistent 60fps pretty much all of the time, only dropping in particularly busy scenes, and has a very well-paced progression with no point in the game that felt too easy or too difficult. The revamped game systems work extremly well: Skills feel neither under- nor overpowered, characters feel unique and pretty much any party combination can work perfectly fine.\nNow, narrative and characterisation has never been an issue for the Neptunia series, but, pleasingly, MegaNep even improves this, making up a story that is spectaclar, dramatic and even emotional at some points in the end. Additionally, it keeps the humorful atmosphere, with Neptune being the goofy, likeable, forth-wall-breaking protagonist that we all know and love. \nIn other words, it's not just a great Neptunia game - It's a great RPG, period. The only thing that saddens me is the fact that so many people will write it off without even giving it a shot for themselves; still, I guess that makes it all the more special for those of us in the know who can enjoy and appreciate it, both on its own merits and as, to date, the absolute pinnacle of the series.", "timestamp_created": 1480349491, "timestamp_updated": 1481810749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 66, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.832737", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27958108": {"recommendationid": "27958108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105220747", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486071800}, "language": "english", "review": "good game ^__^", "timestamp_created": 1480345973, "timestamp_updated": 1480345973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27955475": {"recommendationid": "27955475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198341360278", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508034668}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u6bd4\u524d\u51e0\u4ee3\u66f4\u7ed9\u529b\u4e86\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e5f\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b8c\u5584", "timestamp_created": 1480344367, "timestamp_updated": 1480344367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27954863": {"recommendationid": "27954863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278053461", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481036512}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u65b0\u5165\u624b\u7684\u6e38\u620f \u6839\u672c\u505c\u4e0d\u4e0b\u6765 \u753b\u9762\u5f88\u68d2\n\u5267\u60c5\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9519 \u65e5\u8bed\u914d\u97f3 \u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u8d5e", "timestamp_created": 1480344010, "timestamp_updated": 1480344010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27954512": {"recommendationid": "27954512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257684660", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504978053}, "language": "schinese", "review": "Nip~Nip~Ni~", "timestamp_created": 1480343802, "timestamp_updated": 1480343802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27953554": {"recommendationid": "27953554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217404517", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479740847}, "language": "russian", "review": "This is the best neptunia game in this ganre.

Skip the 2nd paragraph for new players and 3rd for those that have played neptunia's review. \nBtw for anyone that reads this don't listen to reviews(in general )that says anything along the lines of if you don't like anime, fps or rpgs then that the specific game is bad, because it's really not; if you don't a specific genre, it doesn't mean the game is bad, it just means whoever made that review just don't like the genre. ( sorry about that, it's just I read review for a different game that said that it was \"bad\" because of its game genre; now on to the review )\n\nNew players, I going to say this the eng dub and sub might put off the character's line in a different a light sometimes; so I personally use the Japanese dub; but if you really perfer the English dub I won't stop just know that the English dub, can make some lines come out weirder sometimes . And also that some jokes gets lost in the translation, so if it came out weird in English; the joke is either lost in translation , or that it was just not your cup of tea. Also here are fan services, but you watched anime before, just know it's not as bad as DxD, or to love ru; and that it could be a lot worse. If you are not an anime fan, and have only played jrpg like ff, or the tales series, there will be a bit more fan service compared to these two titles; but look at it with an open mind, and that it's no where as bad as hunniepop. The combat gameplay for V2 will be different to some lvl compared to those previously mentioned titles; but nonetheless a very good game. Just that as a new player to the neptunia franchise, story is topically a lot more interesting then what it seems.  Also this game is somewhat new player friendly, just note that it spoils some of the previous main titles, but you don't need to play the previous titles to understand, but it will help if do play the previous titles.  \n\nOk, if you are a neptunia fan, then you probably know this that victory 2 might be one of the greatest neptunia games yep. And that if you like nep, gear and the other CPU's that they are all back and more amazing. Now back to the review, v2 has changed a lot of things when compared to the previous, however this made it a bit more interesting, since this game might be the only one I had to take some time to plan on a boss fight fairly early in the game ( might be, because I rushed a little...) nonetheless, it is awesome.  The new world map, combat system, and the new combo/equipment system most of all was interesting. Since the weapons now, needs the player to be more aware of the combo system, since the type of weapons has a different set of combo slots available. There's other different  changes, but I'm lazy. Victory 2 however is has more of a interesting story compared to previous neptunia games( since in V you would know somethings if you watched the anime, and played the previous games).  In V2 the event scenes are a bit long, but it also allowed the for new players to get an idea of each character, and old players to get a better grip of the storyline.(let's say it's shows more depth, if you understand it) for any new players or old that read this for just Remember to go in to this game with an open mind, and use the Japanese dub, it's a lot better for the neptunia series in my opinion. \n\nFor the time I played it, great game and will continue to play it.", "timestamp_created": 1480228053, "timestamp_updated": 1480228053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

And I love jrpgs so the score might be biased\n\n-Might accidentally contain spoilers. Sorry-\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nThis game uses a different engine compared the Re:Birth series (correct me if I'm wrong) and the visuals are colorful. The CGs are always good and some are fanservices as usual in Neptunia games. The areas are mostly new, though some of the old map themes are still used (the digital dungeon, virtua forest, and outside area. This isnt their official names btw).\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nThere are new features in this game like the revamped combo system, route, and the development system has been changed. It gives this games a fresh feel that wont make you say, \"This is just another Neptunia Re:Birth Remake with a different story and some added characters. Gameplay still same so boring zzz\". There is also a minigame called Neplunker, based on the game spelunker, that is honestly frustrating when you never played spelunker before playing this (like me) but eventually you will get used to it (still frustrating to die jumping so high tho). Grinding in this game is WAYYYYY EASIER compared to the previous games. or maybe its beacause i forgot to turn on the level cap dlc. but hey you dont really need lvl 999 in completing the achievements. Also there is a new form called Next form. EDIT: there is a lvl 999 cap and colo battles and grinding up to that level is a challenge since the biggest xp monster only spawns once and the you can only use 30 of an item that force spawns it per run.\n\nSound: 9/10\nThe music of the story part is mostly still the same from the old Nep games but the new maps and boss themes are new. The opening soundtracks of the three series is my favorite. (fun fact: I actually heard musou katharsis before playing this game and I immediately liked it). And the monsters here have sounds when its their turn. wow.\n\nStory:7/10\nStory has never been the selling point of Neptunia games (I think). But this tries to amaze the player with the new character's coolness. The fourth wall breaker and comedy is here. My favorite thing about this is how they put the gaming puns and I just laugh when I get it. (S-sha's lines are my favorite).\n\nEnd Game Content: 8/10\nI guess the post game content for this is unlocking the endings, the colosseum, , , uh I guess that's it. you will probably spend most of your time finish that rng based achievement (*cough* CPU CHIPS *cough*) and with a painful hand. EDIT: There is a lvl 999 colo battles and that grind is hard. For those new to the series, there is a new game plus so dont worry if you missed something you can just try again. warning though: you scouted areas and hidden treasures will be reset.\n\nConclusion: 9/10\nyeah maybe this score is biased but if this is your first neptunia game, you may have a hard time playing the older ones, as this I said, this is the best nep game there is currently. Post game maybe a little lacking but completing the achievements sure gives you a lot of hours to play this game. It brings new features that give it a new feel rather than a \"same game, just a different story\" kind of feel.\n\nWell hope this helped. Enjoy Nepping.

Megadimension Neptunia VII released in Japan last summer (2015), and international PS4 release was on the first quarter of 2016. The PC version was released in Q3 2016. Unlike some unluckier ones, I had zero problems with the game from the beginning. And boy, was I impressed how much the series has grown. While the cast has been reduced quite a bit, the new additions of Uzume Tennouboshi / Orange Heart and the four Gold Third are a welcome addition. The game runs super smooth, even with my medium-specced rig (AMD FX-4100, GeForce GTX 960 4GB, 8GB DDR3) and it looks very nice (as would be expected from PS3 / PSVita to PS4 change). The soundtrack from the deluxe pack is also a welcome addition (these deluxe packs have been released for other games too, since then) but it does not contain every song found in the game (figures, as some songs are reused from earlier games).\n\nThe story is divided into three arcs, almost episodic like an television series. The premise is nothing you haven't already seen in these games; end up in a weird place, befriend some new people by fighting them and then save the world while searching for a way back home. It's clich\u00e9, but it works in games like this.\n\nAround midway through the story the CPUs gain a massive power upgrade (Next Form). It trivializes some of the content afterwards. Overall, the difficulty seems to lean towards easy for most of the game, save for a few fights that might throw you off until you learn to prepare for them.\n\nOverall, the game is a wonderful addition to the Neptunia series. The music is superb, animations smooth, game mechanics refined and the story, while not deep, manages to keep you interested on what is happening next.\n\nPros and Cons list:\n+Beautiful graphics compared to other titles in the series\n+Beautiful music\n+Next Form, accompanied with full transformation videos and over-the-top attacks. And the music. ABSOLUTEly the best track in the game :)\n+Uzume and the Gold Third\n+Umio!!\n+Same good Neptunia you all love. More of it and refined to the max.\n+Neplurker (Depending on your gaming skills and patience, might become a negative point)\n\n-Scout system\n-Hidden Treasures\n-Lack of many characters from the earlier series such as Falcon, 5pb. and MAGES.\n\nOverall a very solid game, and a good entry point to the series if you haven't played them before. Just beware that the earlier games aren't as pretty and refined as this.\n\n9.5 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1479989345, "timestamp_updated": 1486398558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny":

recommending to both newcomers and veterns of the series.\n\nThis game to me has been longer than Re;birth 3 which took me roughly 50 hours to beat, but I was boosted by the Histoire EXP pack which carried me through the game quicker. However since I couldn't find a DLC for this game, it took me a lot longer to complete which made me really like the game for what it is instead of having DLC carry me to the end.\n\nI like the introduction to both Uzume and Big Neptune. I'd say Big Neptune had a bigger introduction because Uzume at the start was very hostile towards Small Neptune but they quickly got along very fast after a few battles.\n\nZero Dimension was honestly a lot of fun, exploring the newly added dungeons was great, filled with a lot of detail and stuff. In Rebirth 1 to 3, dungeons were at least 2 floors or 2 areas to complete, in this new game, it's more than that so you have a lot more to explore. There's less copy and pasting in this game as well which is great.\n\nSome dungeons keep the same theme but are generally layed out differently so even if the theme is the same, the direction of going somewhere is completely new. After playing all 3 Rebirth games, I'm glad I wasn't playing copy and paste dungeons all the time.\n\nGolden DImension was absolutely interesting as it took all 4 characters a chapter of their own. Neptune, Blanc, Noire and Vert are the protagonists. Instead of shitty company characters (Like Tekken), it introduces 4 new characters, C-Sha, B-Sha, E-Sha, K-Sha and S-Sha which all represents genres instead of companies. I'm not going to spoil these characters too much other than that.\n\nHeart Dimension was a really good chapter, but I'll leave that all to you. I think it's best not to spoil you here.\n\nLet me just remind you though, when you have the chance, grind as much as you can, because this game is tough, but it's worth it.\n\nTime to get the true

It's still more or less the same as before but it's easier to transform and spam the EXE moves in my opinion : just use rush attacks to build up the gauge and unleash the special effects.\nA note on the transformations by the way : You now have transformation cutscenes, like in the original first game, and they look awesome.\nAlso, Neptunia is no longer the main main character : Every CPU enters the spotlight and has her own route during the Act II even though it's not that long. But it's still a nice surprise.   \nOne thing I didn't like though, is that to navigate in the world map you have to use roads and on those roads, you can get a random battle. It's quite unnerving when you have to go from Planeptune to Lowee ecause everytime a battle happens, you have to select again where you want to go. Plus those are very easy so it's just slowing the pace uselessly. Thankfully, on the second playthrough, you get an item to skip them.\nTip : Don't play the Neplunker dungeons. The rewards are not worth breaking your game pad over the frustration.\nSad point : No Pururut.", "timestamp_created": 1479172590, "timestamp_updated": 1479172590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

And also reviews are based on people's opinions... Opinions... [/i]\n\nMegadimension Neptunia VII is the forth installment of the main Re;birth series after Re;birth 3 V Generation.\nSo if you want to experience the whole Nep-Nep story, you might want to play the other re;birth series first.\nBut if you wan't to just play MDN VII before re;births, don't worry they covered everything in the introduction.\n\nAbout the gameplay, i really love the simplified battle system. Everything is just so smooth.\nThey basically added so much improvements from the previous re;birth series.\n\nOkay let's just jump into the pros and cons section shall we?\n\n[b]PROS[/b]:\n- The story is divided into 3 parts (Trilogy), which makes it more interesting in my opinion.\n- Always love the Scouts system, really helps with the grinding.\n- No more Combo Points thingy for your Combo attacks (Wait did they already removed this in re;birth 3? I kinda forgot lol)\n- Combo Traits, basically attacking with a certain 'combo condition' will make the attack a guaranteed critical.\n- So much new dungeons!\n- So much new monsters aswell!\n- More balanced stats and exps. \n- Lots of 'fanservice' >v< b\n- More funny game/anime reference jokes and very enjoyable sub-events too! \n- DLC characters are so worth to get. They're not just useful but they also have their own events too!\n- Lots of feature improvements from the previous re;birth games that you can ever asked for.\n\n[b]CONS[/b]:\n- If you owned and enabled DLC equipments, this auto 'Best Equipment' new feature WILL override your current equipped gears with the best stats gears EVERYTIME your party left/join back again in the story progression.\n  The problem is you can't disable this 'Best Equipment' thingy. (Hopefully they'll fix this soon)\n- If you use a DLC character as a leader in your party while progressing through the story, there's a chance of crashing the game in some events. (I only had one crash because of this in my 2nd playthrough since i don't use DLCs that much in my 1st run)\n- It's getting too grindy for End-Game leveling, especially above level 300.\n\nThat's it. The first two cons are more of a bug related so hopefully they'll fix it soon and i'll update this review.\nOverall, you can already tell that this game is basically the BEST Neptunia series of all!\n\nThank you for reading the review!

Out of it the only \u201cproblem\u201d is the charge time between battles and world exploration.\n\nIn the gameplay, we face a classical Neptunia system with some elements added, more centred in a new balance. In this game we don\u2019t have full access to each combo class, instead we\u2019ll have the slots each weapon has (and no, the best weapons don\u2019t have all the slots unlocked). This, along with the new combo traits, makes more important to chain attacks in order to activate the combo trait (100% accuracy/chance of critical hit) making a better work for the gameplay than the classic \u201cspam breaker until you can spam power\u201d.\nThere\u2019s no longer GP, instead some monsters (and nearly all the bosses) have some kind of part that can be broken to show a weak spot, but the necessity of guard breaking has disappeared and this is a total improvement, also the Exe Drives now have been nerfed to the extreme, making them only a bit more powerful than a common skill and (in higher levels) weaker than a good chain of combo attacks.\n\nThe world map has also been redesigned into a one with a real feel of travel. Now we have to make roads to reach the dungeons with money, cities play a new and more realistic role since our characters can only recover HP/SP without items going to them, items development/scouts are also only accessible from those cities and there are random encounters while travelling between dungeons/cities.\n\nThe scout system has changed once more and, for me, to worst. The new scout system features lots of the classical Gamipics now working for us. In this system we don\u2019t explore an external dungeon like in Stella\u2019s one, now we explore the same dungeons that we have in the game, and each scouts has its own effect to make it easier or harder. They also find monster drops, money and clues to make the hidden treasure appear, but only work with the game running, not like in Victory.\n\nNext Forms make their debut in this game, but they are nothing more than testimonial since their appearances in the main story are more than limited (in this game fighting a story boss with HDD from the start is rare) and, although being awesome, it feels that we need more time with them (hopes for the next game).\n\nIn conclusion, this is overall a must have for every Neptunia fan and, of course, JRPG fan.\nA pretty solid game with good mechanics, improving all the areas and making the gameplay takes a giant step forward and starts killing the flaws of previous Neptunia games.\n\nRated 9.5/10 still needs more Plutia.", "timestamp_created":

enjoyed Megadimension Neptunia VII a lot. I am writting this after having unlocked all the achievements in the game (It was tough, I tell you), this shows how much I love this game. And you might like it too! \nThis was my first Neptunia game, and it is definitly not the last!\nThe thing with Megadimension Neptunia VII, is that it has some really good points but also some rather \"meh\" ones about it. I will try to list them, for any of you, who would like to buy this game.\n\nVery good points:\n-The story is really good, I really loved it, it has some very powerful moments that made me love the Neptunia Universe!\n-Some pieces of music in the soundtrack are amazing, I don't have any other words to describe them. If you were to listen to one I will recommend \"Mousou Katharsis\".\n-The characters have distinct and intresting personnalities, which make them stand out in my opinion from other JRPGs' characters.\n-And they are also very funny, especially Nep.\n\nGood points:\n-The game is long enough to keep you entertained for easely 80 hours.\n-The New Game+ feature is really nice and make less painful the grinding for achievements\n-There are many \"mini-mechanics\" in the game that are very nice (I will not spoil them, it is up to you to discover them! ;))\n-The help messages is very clear and not invasive\n-The quest system is nice\n\n\"Meh\" points:\n-The enemies and certain dungeons can be kind of repetitive\n-The graphics for the dungeons are not that great for a 2015 PS4 game (But people say there is a massive improvement from the previous Neptunia games, so it might not be that relevent)\n-The controls for a PC are not that great, I recommend playing with a controller (Xbox or PS4)\n\nThat's it for me, even if there are some rather \"Meh\" points, this game is really nice, I enjoyed playing it a lot! So give it a try.\nI'm sure that Idea Factory International and Compile Heart are willing to improve their games, and I hope that this review helped, and that those issues will get fixed in the next

rebirth 2 and 3 for my pov. FPS drops non existing on my fx 8320 and 970 including my other pc that use an fx 6300 and R9 270X with an overclocked CPU the game scaled very good on amd hardware that I have tested. Soundtrack is major improvement compare the previous it's have a more depth and techno like instruments. Not only hearing it sound good be prepare for goosebumps some songs on the soundtrack is really relaxing and calming to the ear. Lastly is the story honesty is a massive improvement of rebirth 1 and 3 more serious scenes and more development for the goddess to see what their dreams and wishes. The story humor breaks the fouth wall like no other more a light heart way.

From the previous games as you should already have played, this game is about console wars, one way or another.\n\nBut this is different, Neptunia has went into a dark and serious tone!\nEverything is in disaster, but with that comes new great characters, and some more annoying enemies as well.\n\nEverything is the same honestly, albeit improved and better. Still a turned based grindy RPG, 80% of the game is visual novel. And you can still happily jump 9000 times.\n\nAs a Nep fan, i can only say one thing.\nBuy this game, buy 50 pack of pudding. And play the game. Enjoy~\n\n\n[EDIT] Okay so actual review, after finishing the game after spending weeks on this game (I have a very short time on computer, and i really rarely play games) I must say, this is one if not, a large imrpovement compared to all games, and is the second best Neptunia game for me.\nThe story is really well-written, there are some plotholes and a bit of elements not explained, but this is Neptunia, where's the fun in it if everything is explained?\n\nIts really good, pretty good, i went through all 3 endings, and all of it was worth it (P.S, bad end sucks really)\nAnd other characters also get more fleshed out, at least, compared to RB3. Which is nice.\n\nNow, story aside as i praised it like it's a masterpiece, next is the soundtrack, it's absolutely amazing, very well composed, and some of the soundtracks are made by well-known artists.\nThe techno-genre-ish / futuristic like soundtracks are great, although it may revolve around that, there are some other soundtracks that are peaceful, funny, upbeat and a bit sad.\n\nThe songs in this game are definitely good, i loved Mousou Karthasis (Spoilers!) of all songs in this game, although Zero Dimension's song was good as well.\n\nNow, songs aside, performance is a bit... eh, there are some issues regarding potato specs computers, and well i recommend that you don't play this on a laptop unless you want it to burn.\nIt really requires a strong computer, since i played this game on a Quad Core Q6000 2.40GHz and a GT 730 4GB, i kinda stuttered in a lot of scenes, skills, cutscenes and whatnot.\nIt still good though, game still looks amazing even if the settings are lowered, so that's one good thing.\n\nOverall gameplay is the same as other nep games, but of course, its updated, combos are now more useful as they have the effeciency system (Consistent combos) and there's more skills!\nUpdated skill animations, new EXE moves, and more that is added, definitely an improvement.\n\nReplayability is...well, three times at best, assuming you want all endings, but overall I don't find Neptunia games to be super replayable, but moreso a one-time only story for me, Its still fun to read the tidbits of dialogues though and such.\n\nOther than that, i don't have anything to say more, it's a pretty good JRPG game, and it's anime with the cutest protagonist ever made in existent, Neptune.\n\nI'd say its a 9.5/10, to be honest, i'm biased to nep games, but even so, this is really good, a step higher up at least from the abomination called Re;birth 3.\n[spoiler]Yes i really hate that game, shush[/spoiler]\nSo, without further ado, buy the game, download it, buy puddings, and play the game!", "timestamp_created": 1475049164, "timestamp_updated": 1481343815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000",

title (R;B3:V Generation)\n- Great story (if you like 4th walls broken every second line of text)\n- There's actual plot!\n- Great voice acting, as usual!\n- Great humor (if you get the references)\n- The HDD transformation sequences have been reworked and look pretty nice. \n- Most skills have custom animations too.\n- Umio.\n- New levels, new enemies.\n\nCons:\n- The game is one patch behind the official release, meaning some features or game 'improvements' may be missing. \n- I purchased all the DLC only to find out that there's no real leveling/character progression past level 200-ish so most of the Colloseum battles will remain untouched. The only way to level up past 200 is killing the same enemy over and over again over 3000 times. Given the inventory limitations for enemy-respawning items this would mean a couple hundred of hours just to get to 999.\n\nComplaints:\n- The damage output of EXE Drives is pathetically low, compared to other Neptunia games. They deal less damage than a normal attack combo or a standard magic attack.\n- Combo EXP bonus is lower (because the game is a patch behind) for large combos, which means grinding experience takes effectively twice as much time. (For instance: You do a 200 combo hit and that should net you a 100% bonus EXP, but it currently tops at 8%)\n\nTL;DR:\n- If you're a fan of the series and don't mind the drawbacks noted in the complaints section, this game is a must have. Hopefully it'll get patched one day, allowing for an end-game leveling progression which doesn't rely on a single enemy for grinding. \n\nAs a fan of the franchise and Tsunako's artwork, I can recommend this game (without the DLC).

Pros and Cons time! And just because i'm Nep fans so i had no choice but atleast better than IGN or any) \n\nPros:\n+ Battle System (Become more 3D ver and is more different than Re;birth 1,2 and 3)\n+ Post/Style (Every different win have 2 different post every battle)\n+ New Transformation (As you know, NEXT form,)\n+ Quality (Most likely are seem more len flare, shadow and a lots. You can change the settings in the game)\n+ Combo (If combo traits correct, critz everytime!)\n+ Transformation effect (It's more different than Re;birth just without any transfiguration step but now they added. For some reason)\n+ Game series (Now they have 3 series in game. Zero, Hyper and Heart dimension.)\n+ Weapon (Different weapon different Combo traits)\n+ Shop (Cheaper than you thought!)\n+ Investment (Increase your Shares, Dev item and Cloth)\n+ Fun DLC (Umio, Nepgya and lots of Party Character you can bought)\n+ Character (Now there's Gold Third and some.. spoiler character are able to join!)\n+ Story (3 Different dimension, 3 different story. The true story are started on the beginning.\n+ Guild (Improve your shares, but there's no cost on ur shares)\n+ Gallery (Rewatch the events)\n+ Disc (You can able to create a Disc name on Disc! What am i saying)\n+ Disc Chips (You can able to bought at Shop or you can get it on Monster)\n+ Ending (The ending are always sad. But is a good story)\n+ Map (Different than before, use route to go everywhere)\n\nCons:\n- DLC (DLC is too op enough to kill these monster easily and without taking any damage)\n- Combo (Now that unable to use the same combo skill)\n- Skill (Still the old skill nothing much change)\n- Enemy (Enemy are strong, so without level up ur character, it's hard to beat the boss and Enemy)\n- Graphic (If you change it to high, might be laggy when they transform and the step will be different. (If you're using old Graphic card)\n- DLC Glitch (When you start a new game plus, everything will mess out. Except you have to turn if off and back on again. Then have to restart the game)\n- Guild (Less than before)\n- Investment (The price, it's killing people)\n- Ending (In bad ending/good ending. You're unable to play back the game, you have to start New Game Plus.)\n- Map (It's pretty annoying to go everywhere without New Game Plus, monster appear randomly and stopped ur move)\n\nNothing much to say. But here's the pros and cons that i noticed. If there's offensive things to you i'm sry, but this is just my pros and cons.\n\nIf i miss something maybe.. you can tell or else i guess.\n\n(Sorry if i had a bad grammar)", "timestamp_created":

Following the events of Re;Birth: 3 the main cast goes on their biggest adventure yet. This time we follow the tragic tale of the Sega Dreamcast.\n\nIf you've played any of the previous games you'll know what to expect going in. A large cast, lots  of meta jokes, hundreds upon hundreds of jokes about Gamer and Otaku culture, and a turn-based battle system that rewards mild positioning and strategy. but lacks real depth. If you've been following the Video Game scene for a while expect to get about 1/2 the jokes. If you know a lot of Otaku culture (Anime, 2Chan, etc.) expect to get the other half.\n\nPROS:\n[list]\n[*]The battle system has had another minor overhaul making your combo length based on your weapon choice. The attacks you use now also have modifiers that can buff them if you meet certain requirements.\n\n[*]The game requires very little to no grinding as long as you do fight [i]some[/i] enemies along your path through the dungeon, but this may be the hardest of the 4 main entries due to the fact the story constantly forces you in to smaller 1-2 man party sizes (sometimes without a dedicated healer) with 3 members at the most for large chunks of the story.\n\n[*]Each of the 4 main Goddesses get their own dedicated story arcs. This is cool.\n\n[*]The \"Development\" tree, which before allowed players to alter the way the game behaves, has been completely redone and now serves solely as a way to create items.\n\n[*]Each of the 4 main cities now has an \"Investment\" option where you're able to spend your Credits on one of 3 branches: R&D, Commerce, and PR. (P.S. Only PR is worth your time)\n\n[*]Unique dungeons and challenges in all dungeons that unlock special items.\n\n[*]Scouts that act as Dungeon Modifiers which grant buffs to the location you send them to.\n\n[*]There's now a navigable overworld that lets you set routes up to traverse complete with random encounters!\n\n[*]New dungeons that actually require some minimal exploration and platforming!\n[/list]\n\nCONS:\n[list]\n[*]The development tab is now completely worthless for most people AND getting the items to do it DOES take lots of grinding.\n\n[*]Quests (which were mostly grinding before, but offered some value to do along the way) now offer very little unless you do spend time grinding your way up through them.\n\n[*]The game constantly pulls people in and out of your party, but this resets any equipment you have on them. You like those clothes and the hat you dressed them up in? Too bad. Put them on again.\n\n[*]The random encounters in the overworld...\n\n[*]There are still too many recycled dungeons along the main path of the game.\n\n[*]Lots of the dialogue is broken up into small \"chirper\" events now. They help simulate that X amount of time has gone by, but there are times where you basically go through 3 or 4 of these in a row that may as well have been 1 longer one.\n\n[*]The item drop rate is excruciatingly low. If you want to craft anything you WILL be grinding. Even with scouts gathering resources for you.\n[/list]\n\nOVERALL:\nWhile I can't call this one the best of the main series, I still think 3 is the overall best, it is definitely up there. If you want to try the series out for the first time I'd recommend checking Re;Birth 3 out over this one. It's simply a better entry point for the series. Megadimension Neptunia takes the series 3 steps forward and 1 step back. I'd love to see Quests be more important and the development tab return to form.

Although I've barely scratched the surface, I am loving what I am seeing so far. It is on the path to becoming a favourite vidya of mine. I'd highly recommend this: it's as close as you will get to finding a 'perfect game'. \n\nPros/Cons I have noticed so far:\n\n(+): Running on a somewhat dated AMD graphics card and processor (absolutely disgusting, I know) in 45-60fps and high video quality. This is impressive given how I could not do this with Re;Birth 1 or 2--a good testament to how this is a pretty good modern port.\n\n(+): Continuity of certain relationships/certain arcs of the earlier games. It's suffice to say that this latest edition restores/retains many of the relationships from the previous games (my favorite, Nep and Noire; the sisters; Nepgear and Uni; etc). It also retains the elements of story people may have liked from 1 or 2, while not necessarily retconning or confirming others. It just leaves controversial parts of certain previous games unmentioned. In my opinion, this is a good take on how to deal with loose ends [unresolved arcs] when adding a new game to your series.\n\n(+): Pretty effective new chars.; pretty effective perosnas for each one.\n\n(+): One of the first things I noticed is that the dialogue is much less long-winded than the \nprevious games. The conversations featured in the game convey their main point concisely, and even manage to add some filler into each one without feeling superfluous. \n\n(+): Holds many clever parallels and/or references to the first game which I certainly enjoyed. This undoubtedly holds some significance to the story, too. \n\n(+): Impressive visuals comparative to other games in the series, and in general. I particularly enjoyed what they did with the character models during conversation scenes. Compile Heart REALLY committed to sharpening the models of each character, and I love it.\n\n(+): Like the previous games, this holds a metric shit ton of fan service. But you're probably well aware of this, too, if you are browsing this series in the first place.\n\n(+): Kick ass musical score\n\n(+): Glorious yuri overload \n\n(+): Large, original, and fairly pretty maps/reskins. I'm around 15% in, and its 75% original; 25% reskin.\n\n(biggest pro/con): There is no fourth wall. Take that as you will.\n\n(minor con): Takes a while for the story to officially ignite. It took around 40 minutes for me to become fully engaged. \n\nI'll come back to this and edit as I progress with the story.\n\nUpdate: True Ending improves the game A LOT. I was already really satisifed and considering it a favorite game of mine even with a lesser ending. After that though, I'd say I'm satisifed enough to 100% this game, which I generally never do with games. Additionally, the prerequisites to achieving it are less convoluted or understated compared to the previous games.

Not to mention i didnt want them to change the game in the first place. \nNegatives:\nThis game barely touches the same level of comedy, barely touches the same level of emersive gameplay, Completly changed how you have to battle, Tons of storyline battles are completely luck based (Spoiler maybe: At some point you battle the 4 cpus sometimes they can continusly spam exe moves or somtimes you can live while they use normal attacks), They put in a new quest system but they dont even use it effectivly, it barely touches the same level of almost everything. By the way remeber all the items you used to be able to collect in dungeons? Yeah, nope not anymore.\nPositives:\nHowever there are some big imporvemnets (not enough to balance its flaws)- The Scout system is way better, the new characters are really cool, investment is a really cool concept (they killed it by making anything but public relations almost pointless), Also it is really neat and annoying (but its a good kind of annoying) how you can have random encounters

stories are a nice twist to the neptunia games along with new characters like Uzume (super kawaii!!!) and i love the music in this series over the other 3 predecessors and the new NEXT forms add a nice welcome bit of spark to our beloved protagonist, loli's, gaming otaku, and tsundere.......plus.............there is some A+++ Neppintastic! fanservice here for all the neptunia fans dying for whats........\"NEXT\"......lol.....also i love that the EXE drive moves arent OP \"insta-kill\" anymore like they were in the other games......neptunia games dont require much thought at all in battle.....but at least now it requires a little more......\n\nvery good game i would have to say it is tied with the first neptunia rebirth game as my favorite of the whole series when i am in the

Re:Birth3, our beloved CPUs, CPU Candidates, and humans return on this installment that showcases three dimensions happening in different timelines namely; Zero, Hyper, and Heart Dimensions.\n\n\n[h1][u][b]Gameplay[/b][/u][/h1]\n\n\nIn a nutshell, [b][i]Megadimension Neptunia VII[/i][/b] is a compilation of three (3) different episodes: Zero Dimension, Hyper Dimension, and Heart Dimension. \n\n[i]Zero Dimension[/i] (which is the first one to be played from the three), shows a darker premise compared to the setting of the other games in which is presented in a post-apocalyptic fashion of Gamindustri in which a new goddess, [i]Uzume Tennouboshi, the Orange Heart.[/i]\n\n[i]Hyper Dimension\u2019s[/i] story and setting is very similar to the earlier Re:Birth games and focuses more a new character group called \u201cGold Third\u201d formed by [i]C-Sha, S-Sha, B-Sha, and K-Sha[/i], and serve as the counterparts of our dear Gamindustri goddesses that also has a transformation similar to HDD referred to as [i]\u201cGold Form\u201d[/i].\n\n[i]Heart Dimension[/i] focuses more on plot twists which is the result of the combination of both the Zero and Hyper Dimensions, wherein the CPUs travel to a strange, new dimension to find out who is the mastermind of the anomalies happening in other worlds.\n\nThe gameplay, compared to the earlier games of the series has also improved. One of those improvements is the [i]\"Combo Make\"[/i] system, which is somewhat staple in the series. This system helps you customize the attacks that you can use to combo in which the number depends on the current weapon you have equipped on your character (with a maximum of 5). \n\nIn these combos, there are three types of attacks that you can do; [i]\"Rush\"[/i] attacks, which focuses fast multi-hit strikes, but gives fairly low damage per strike; [i]\"Power\"[/i] attacks, which hits harder than the other types but has lower number of strikes; and [i]\"Strike\"[/i] attacks, which is a balanced type in terms of power and strike count.\nAnother feature on this system is the [i]\"Traits\"[/i] for each attack type, wherein successfully fulfilling the condition stated on the trait (ex. a standard attack requires you to NOT use a power attack) will bring in more damage output to the performed attack type.\n\nOther gameplay features such as the [i]\"Disc Developer\" and \"Item Development\"[/i] similar to the earlier games comes back in this game which serves as a method to make additional equipment or items for your characters. [i]Disc Developer[/i] allows you to create your own original game discs by incorporating \"Idea Chips\" which has different kinds and varies from levels 1 to 5.Certain combinations can determine if the disc will turn into a [i]\"Godly\" or \"Sucky\"[/i] game which offers additional positive or negative bonuses once equipped. \n\n[i]Item Development[/i], on the other hand, allows you develop items, accessories, and even weapons for your characters to use. In order to make those stuff, you will need to have a [i]\"Product Proposal\"[/i] which serves as a recipe and will require you to gather ingredients as well as achieving specific Lily Ranks between two characters to produce it.\n\nNot only that, there also other mini-games that you can access (take Neplunker as an example), as well as additional maps and characters unlocked through the DLCs.\n\n\n[h1][u][b]The Pros[/b][/u][/h1]\n\n\n    [*][b][i]Quality Art and Audio[/i][/b] - Whenever I play Neptunia games, I always look forward to the soundtracks that I can add to my playlist as well as the \"cutesy\" and \"ecchi\" moments described by the artworks presented, both of which are plenty and of quality (and beware, asmost of the art are more revealing compared to the earlier games). High quality standard being kept by IdeaFactory is very much worth of praise.\n\n    [*][b][i]Improved Difficulty Balance[/i][/b] - If you played the earlier games of the series (Hyperdimension 1 to 3), most of them are pretty easy and smooth-sailing in terms of the battle system. However in this rendition, it seems that our daily mobs have learnt some spunk and will give you a hard time especially if you skip most of the enemies and ignore leveling your characters. This is a good adaptation which ups the challenge of the gameplay instead of just hacking enemies in a flash.\n\n    [*][b][i]Tons of Hours in Game Content[/i][/b] - Seperated into three different episodes (Zero, Hyper, and Heart Dimensions), this rendition of the series is arguably the most \"content heavy\" compared to the earlier Neptunia games. But the game having separate episodes split isn't the only reason why it has more content, the game showcases the comeback of characters from the earlier games (like IF and Compa), as well as some new and interesting characters (like Uzume Tennouboshi and the Gold Third), and also some new features in the gameplay such as the \"Combo Make\" which adds more flavor to the battle system.\n\n\n[h1][u][b]The Cons[/b][/u][/h1]\n\n\n    [*][b][i]Grind Heavy Gameplay[/i][/b] - Due to the gameplay being more of a challenge than the earlier games of the series, this factor will translate into more grind time for players to compensate for the difficulty balancing. Another factor contributing to that is this time, there won't be an EXP boost add-on that could help decrease the grinding, especially in the end-game stages.\n\n    [*][b][i]Reused Assets[/i][/b] - As you progress through the game, you will notice that the enemies and some of the dungeons are somewhat reused with a different arrangement (ex. different color scheme but same model, same maps from the earlier games). While this is something that has been around since the earlier games and isn't something that is of a major downside, it would've been a nice addition especially since the game's theme is about other dimensions.\n\n\n[h1][u][b]Final Thoughts[/b][/u][/h1]\n\nAs usual, Neptunia games are of quality and it's a no-brainer to get for long-time fans, and it is a pretty good RPG to say at the very least for those who are new to the series (and to those who are new, beware of fan-service content overload). \n\n[b]Rating[/b] - 9.2/10 \n\n[quote]This review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/elitegives]Elite Giveaways[/url], check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1473356550, "timestamp_updated": 1473357061, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.783763", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25381892": {"recommendationid": "25381892", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994158219", "num_games_owned": 456, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 15911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513533890}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "Nepgear !

are worth mentioning: I have neither played any Neptunia game ever before, (thus this review is meant to be a standalone one , not a comparison to previous titles.) Nor I'm experienced with Novel games as they have never really dragged my interest in the past. (Although in the contrary im familiar with the RPG elements this game provides). \n\nDespite all that, I had a wonderful time playing through and finishing the game and im most likely going to play around on my NG+ savefile a little bit more. Aside from all this , i've decided to split the review into Short Gameplay Positives and Detailed Gameplay Negatives. The reason behind that is that I feel like there's an overflow of positive self-explanatory stuff over the few actual worth mentioning negative stuff. [/i]\n\n[h1] Introduction [/h1]\n\nMegadimension Neptunia VII is a game that combines the Novel and RPG genre into one , creating a heavily story driven game while adding alot of gameplay elements to keep you interested and curious to see how your characters and the story progress. The game has it's own standalone story although there are many characters that you may be familiar with if you have played the franchise in the past. With the main protagonists being Neptune and her sister Nepgear you'll find yourself in a crazy dimensional hopping adventure, A story broken down into 3 Arcs that on average should take around 40-50 hours to complete assuming you do not skip dialogues and play the game the way its meant to be played. Ontop of that once you're finished you're given the ability to start a NG+ which allows you to try for a different ending, raises difficulty and opens you up to more achievements and challenge hunting.\n\n[h1] Short Gameplay Positives [/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]The first playthrough alone should offer 40-50 hours of rich storytime and action.\n    [*]A great variety in customization for each character including weapons , clothing for both human and HDD forms and accesories.\n    [*]Visually, very satisfying both in 3D action and on the Character + Background art during dialogue.\n    [*]Alot of treasures/unlockables spread around all dungeons for the players to search for.\n    [*]A great ammount of soundtracks and sounds whether you're in a dungeon , listening through the story or moving around in the overall map.\n    [*]A great ammount of action-filled unique skills for each character, each with its own crazyness whether its casted directly from them or if it's a formation skill where specific characters gather up to cast an attack together.\n    [*]A selection of either Japanese or English Voice-overs to choose from depending on personal preferation.\n    [*]Both grindy and casual achievements for players to hunt.\n    [*]A big selection of dungeons to play through with many enviromental themes and many different type of monsters.\n    [*]After finishing the game, the choise of going for a NG+ which adds more playtime for those interested and those who want to replay the game without having to start from zero.\n    [*]Multiple Characters to unlock and choose from despite them not being available on all the parts of the game. (Unless on NG+!)\n[/list] \n\n[h1] Detailed Gameplay Negatives [/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]The system the developers use on dungeons, while there is a big variety of base themes, is basically recycling a selection of them and changing their layout. While that isn't really a problem I feel like they could improve ALOT on filling out these giant -but at the same time, aside from monsters and few breakable blockable objects such as boxes- EMPTY dungeons. \n    [*]While knowing this is a novel-based game and perhaps the developers wouldn't want to drive that core element away from their game, it would be welcome to see more animated parts on core story moments. It seems that there was an effort  to do that , but it seems like it was executed poorly.\n    [*]It bothers me that while theres such a great variety of skills, you cannot interact in any way with them after you've casted them. I would like to see some gameplay elements like: Pressing a certain key on the right time while you're watching the animation of your skill, will cause extra damage or not pressing it at all, will cause it to miss. It doesn't have to be that way for every single skill but it's a real shame when the grinding part gets to you and you basically skip through the animations of skills you've watched multiple times in the past and theres no longer an excitement factor into them. (You can skip watching friendly/enemy attacks or skills with a press of the button if you want to speed up the game)\n    [*]Illusionary difficulty: While that shouldn't be something surprising for an RPG , obviously the higher your level is, the easier the game gets. The more underleveled you are, the more grinding you'll have to do. But it seems that there are many stats like Elemental damage and Ele. Resistances that didnt seem to be all that important in the first playthrough/main parts of the game and it seems like raw difference in levels is all it takes to beat the enemy.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Conclussion [/h1] \n\nI didn't know what to expect when I jumped in. Having the game's pricetag in my head ([i]Note: I recieved the game for free[/i]), I told myself at the beginning that I was going to be a little bit more \"harsh/judgemental\" than usual but in all honesty I put that feeling aside within the first 3 hours as I was getting sucked into the story more and more. If you like novels or RPGs with a rich story for that matter then I definitely recommend Megadimension Neptunia VII, I had tons of fun playing and in the future Im looking forward to try a new Neptunia title.", "timestamp_created": 1472785927, "timestamp_updated": 1472829690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628926", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25293006": {"recommendationid": "25293006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119534537", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486074122}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't even know where i should begin, this game is awesome.

But still disappoints, they do not aspire to give the game the dimensions needed to win awards, or impress me. It had a few good moments but many of these fell flat. A game not worth it's 50$ price (I think it's 35$-45$).\nIt's still in my perspective a mediocre (but improving) JRPG that relies on it's \"cutesy\" characters and laid back story to sell, this game certainly ain't bad, but compared to other games this game isn't that good. Buy this game if you want a mediocre japanese RPG with cutesy characters and tons of dialog of which only 50% is voiced. (and soft porn)\n\n\n\n---------------------STORY\n\nBeginning with story/world, I believed it to be ok, but with a touch of anime \"logic\" in that in the \"dimensions\" there are certain rules that if one thinks can predict what is to come, and better foreshadowing; when the mysterious voice talks to some of the characters in the \"better off\" dimension in a certain way, indeed there is a \"guessing game\" in the story that is functional and somewhat captivating.\nThe hyperdimension drivel is still here of course, but this time is injected into scenarios even more out of place than the previous games, almost as if a checklist; whenever there is a big boss battle there is a segment of drivel dialog to lighten things up bafflingly, you can compare with minimal error it to soldiers in a \"military shooter\" talking about their country's superstars in the seconds prior to combat; literally about an 1 or 2 sentences are committed to it, now I like my drivel, and the overall lightheartedness of the story but there are better ways of transmitting it.\n\nAbout 95% of the story is done through this animated 2d artwork that is nice and definitely cheap and effective but it leaves me craving, indeed this is a restricting thing that the developers chose to do that does not permit many cinematographic techniques; you will be seeing these 2d artworks doing the talking with little added to make it impactful, I felt they neglected to use other modes of communicating story, probably since it was cheaper this way. The cut-scenes in this game are used mainly to show transitions, and are what I feel is a neglected idea when it comes to varying how the story will be expressed and would be better if these happened more often during the middle of the game, where small cut-scenes would be played to better entertain me, but the current direction of their use is rare when used for story, and is more often as an enhancement to combat as a short improvised cutscene during it, I suspect most of their \"cut-scene budget\" was spent on the \"cut-scene attacks\" that you can make your character use.\nI recall what I thought was a waste of 3d assets in a fight between the witch and the purple-haired character, where they had an opportunity to have the camera pan on the character's faces as the fight ground down and dialog ensues, instead it quickly reverts back to the 2d stuff.\n\nAbout 80% of the humor and humor deriving from 4th wall breaking is coming from the dialog with comments like \"switching out the protag; Really?\" or \"here comes a source of EXP and credits\" or \"UGH, annoying\", and incidents with the story dialog, some of it was funny though much of it constrained in the 2d artwork. I really woulda wanted a greater \"Range\" of topics that can be expressed in the story, like mayhap more depth into some of the sociological impacts of games or I dare say it, something bad about video games (though I  don't think the developers are brave and/or creative enough to bring up a topic in a way that doesn't clash to harshly with the lighthearted story). Minimally there is also a wish of something more significant in this story, to reduce it's \"simple/lightheartedness\" and to provide more substantial metaphors, such that when I saw one of the baddies and her \"delusion power\" I thought we had here an opportunity to hint towards the insanity of our modern situation, but to some disappointment it was largely a baddy power, and not really a metaphor for anything. A part of me also wanted more environmental or absurdist humor in it, the kind that \"goat simulator\" specializes in; like making a level that is a parody of some trope or some \"rule\" in gaming and then have the characters comment on it, rather than having nearly all of the humor coming from character dialog, of which indeed would have been expensive but I think would expand and improve the humor. However a point against me is that likely, much of the humor is too japanese-specific to be registered by me so thus some of my points are weakened.\n\nMidway through the game they chose to to split up the the 4 main characters up into their own smaller adventure which was nice, since it that let more of their dialog and personalities show through instead of having it to compete with all of the others, though I felt that the good guys were largely the same bunch that one experienced in the last couple of games. Often it felt that there was some absurd luck as if from a cartoon came to twist the fate of the good guys inexplicably, like when another \"Goodie\" fell from the sky and helped them, or when the witch suddenly is saved by the ninja, or the gullibility of the main character, or the many times the goodies or the baddies get away from danger, all of this reinforces the cartoonly narrative, but I still feel something lacking. This could all be seen as refreshing if you had not played another Jrpg or have been isolated to your own culture, but they became boring to me about 60% into the game, then I preferred to read and rush through the goodie's dialog instead of hearing it, and the only the bad guys (specifically the robots) I listen to (since I wanted to see how they would trash the goodies).\n\nSome of the fun in that midway section came from the peculiar nature of the new rulers of the nations, they didn't really care that much about ruling and weren't about gaining power yet they still had it, and most saw it as on opportunity to live their lives closer to their dreams, indeed 3 of them weren't really in charge of their own societies, content to live in their own ideal life, and the 4th was so relaxed in exercising her powers as to be well \"cool\" but unfit for ruling. I personally like these kinds of reversals and the \"good guys\" interacting with them to get back their nations.\n\nTowards the end (optimal ending), I felt the game was inflating it's gameplay a bit, with additional content that didn't feel timely, since clearly the \"core reactor\" was destroyed and the \"ship\" was collapsing and yet the characters stayed for an inordinate amount of time fighting bosses and enemies for what felt like 4 dungeons, the story was properly climactic at that time, but I would have preferred that once \"core reactor\" was destroyed the story dramatically sped up to hurry along to it's end, which I thought would have been an improvement.\n\nDue to my bad word economy and broadness, you must look at the last 28 comments to read the review.", "timestamp_created": 1472214093, "timestamp_updated": 1472257773, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.348224", "comment_count": "34", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25158173": {"recommendationid": "25158173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124182815", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473250708}, "language": "english", "review": "What can i say about this game?\nLike.....\nIt's like 3 neptunia games in one.\n+You have the Zero Dimension,Hyperdimension G and then the Heart Dimension\n+The story is much more complicated and interesting than in previous neptunia games.\n+You have new features like route building and investements.\n+We have a scout option similar to Fairy Fencer F's fury option.\n+Battles are much faster and polished than before.\n+The PS4 graphics look sick\n+Next Forms\n+Grinding is much much easier\n+Overall the soundtrack is the same with some new tracks that i personally like very much.\n~Because the game is split in three alone the parts are kind of short about 15h maybe?\n~The new battle movement with the energy is kind of strange,not that bad though.\n~The giant battles feel very strange.\n-The random encounters through the map become boring and repetitve.\nI can't say many bad things about this game.\n(But you should know I'm kinda biased)", "timestamp_created": 1472203175, "timestamp_updated": 1473096156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25134431": {"recommendationid": "25134431", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078526452", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504218532}, "language": "thai", "review": "Oppai every where!", "timestamp_created": 1472139864, "timestamp_updated": 1472139864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25133253": {"recommendationid": "25133253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058520931", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 10333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474707680}, "language": "french", "review": "Megadimension Neptunia, dans la s\u00e9rie des Hyperdimension c'est le 4, par rapport aux trois premiers c'est le premier en 1080p, il est beau tr\u00e8s beau, les cr\u00e9atures et donjons se renouvellent enfin, l'histoire n'est pas trop mal, il y a trois sortes de fins, m\u00eame si je consid\u00e8re que la Good Ending n'en est pas une... Le syst\u00e8me est tr\u00e8s diversifi\u00e9, on a \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de choses \u00e0 faire, il faut aussi avoir du skill avec les deux niveaux Neplunker toutefois avec de l'entra\u00eenement et de la patience \u00e7a passe.\nPassons aux d\u00e9fauts, ils sont tr\u00e8s nombreux...\nPremi\u00e8re chose qu'on remarque, de base si les personnages ne sont pas en combat, ils ne gagnent pas d'exp, sachant qu'au maximum il y a 4 personnages au combat (je ne compte pas les switch \u00e7a casse toute progression d'exp) et qu'il n'y a que 2 personnages qui ont un passif qui fait que sans combat ils gagnent quand m\u00eame de l'exp (qui d'ailleurs est bugu\u00e9 car les personnages n'ont pas besoin d'avoir le lily ad\u00e9quat pour avoir ce passif), donc pour r\u00e9sumer il n'y a que 6 personnages qui peuvent exp... On est donc oblig\u00e9 de faire des discs pour tous les autres et de mettre Learning, compar\u00e9 aux trois premiers c'est vraiment un gros d\u00e9faut, surtout avec 999 levels.\nEnsuite on remarque qu'il y a des plans en fonction des villes et qu'il faut tout parcourir pour v\u00e9rifier \u00e0 chaque fois si tel ou tel truc est d\u00e9bloquable, avec 6 villes sur 3 plateaux diff\u00e9rents, je trouve pas que \u00e7a soit vraiment un d\u00e9faut mais de l\u00e0 \u00e0 dire que c'est plaisant, je pr\u00e9f\u00e9rais de loin lorsque tout \u00e9tait au m\u00eame endroit comme dans les anciens jeux.\nEnsuite les scouts... dans le 2 et le 3 nous avions Stella, dans le 4 vous avez des pnj qui vont squatter des donjons que vous choisissez, petit truc sympa, vous pouvez m\u00eame les monter de levels pour qu'ils cherchent mieux mais les objets pour les faire \u00e9voluer sont limit\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque NG+, du coup l\u00e0 m\u00eame en ayant fait le jeu de base plus 2 NG+ bah j'ai pas tout au max et on a clairement pas envie de tout refaire...\nJe passerai rapidement sur le syst\u00e8me d'attaque discr\u00e8te qui est totalement bugu\u00e9, oblig\u00e9 de rester \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 d'un point de sauvegarde pour ne pas trop y passer de temps.\nLes armes, m\u00eame avec les DLC, c'est pitoyable tellement c'est mal fait, \u00e0 croire que les mecs qui ont cod\u00e9 \u00e7a en avait juste rien \u00e0 faire des gens qui allaient payer le jeu, histoire que vous vous rendiez compte, les meilleures armes sont ridicules par rapport aux trois premi\u00e8res jeux, mais genre vraiment, du coup vous vous dites que celles des DLC \u00e7a sera mieux, bon d'accord oui elles sont mieux, sauf que... Elles rajoutent pas \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de stats, y'en a bien une qui est correcte, elle donne 10% de plus d'exp, mais la meilleure arme, LA MEILLEURE ARME, elle vous retire 30% de PV \u00e0 chaque fois que c'est le tour de ce personnage, DU G\u00c9NIE. Ca donne une id\u00e9e des DLC, cool hein.\nSinon j'ai encore plein de d\u00e9fauts \u00e0 \u00e9num\u00e9rer mais je vais achever \u00e7a en parlant de l'exp.\nL'exp, un truc cool, alors pour faire simple, les dlc qui permettent d'aller jusqu'au level 999 sont gratuits, on pourrait penser que tout est fait pour, bah nan, dans ton cul, pour \u00eatre plus pr\u00e9cis, le meilleur mob donne au max 20 millions d'exp (on obtient un bonus d'exp selon le nb de coups donc on peut aller un peu plus loin, 35 millions selon certaines vid\u00e9os), \u00e0 \u00e7a il faut rajouter que ce mob est en un seul exemplaire, dans un donjon dans le noir, sans radar et qu'il est au dernier \u00e9tage d'un donjon, magnifique n'est-ce pas. Mais c'est pas termin\u00e9 car l'exp des personnages n'est pas comme une courbe logarithme, elle augmente assez rapidement, ce qui fait que lorsque vous avez pein\u00e9 et que vous \u00eates vers le level 300 et bah dans certaines situations, un personnage peut ne pas monter de level sur 2 mobs, magnifique. Sinon y'a le colis\u00e9e pour exp mais alors l\u00e0... M\u00eame des mobs avec la moiti\u00e9 de votre level peut vous d\u00e9bo\u00eeter, grandiose.\nVoil\u00e0 j'ai \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s donn\u00e9 une vision objective du jeu, si vous aimez neptunia et que vous \u00eates l\u00e0 pour l'histoire, le jeu vous plaira, sinon il vous d\u00e9go\u00fbtera, moi il me donne qu'une envie, tricher, car en plus je l'ai pas dit mais il y a un event bugu\u00e9 qui donne une CG et qui n'appara\u00eet pas, un bug connu lors de la sortie du jeu sur PS4, il y a apparemment des manips \u00e0 faire pour essayer de le d\u00e9bloquer mais faire un NG+ non merci.\nSinon pour faire un amalgame, vous prenez le jeu Fairy Fencer F, qui est une merde pas possible pour l'exp car pas optimis\u00e9 correctement, avec des plans biens chiants, ainsi que le jeu de Noire avec le syst\u00e8me de Lily rank qui est le pire que j'ai vu... Vous m\u00e9langez tout \u00e7a, vous augmentez la difficult\u00e9, vous avez Megadimension Victory II. Le jeu est clairement pas optimis\u00e9 au-del\u00e0 du lvl 99, les armes sont \u00e0 chier, on sait pas trop quel perso est vraiment bon car en fonction des situations on a parfois pas acc\u00e8s aux sorts ni aux items lors du colis\u00e9e.\nEn somme, ce jeu est \u00e0 r\u00e9server \u00e0 ceux qui suivent pour l'histoire, elle est cool, le jeu est beau, on regrettera donc juste le WTF des d\u00e9veloppeurs qui veulent juste pourrir les joueurs, on est l\u00e0 pour jouer, appr\u00e9cier, pas pour avoir envie de tricher parce qu'on a autre chose \u00e0 foutre que passer une centaine d'heures \u00e0 tuer le m\u00eame mob pour atteindre le level 999.

As far as the story goes, you first get \"sucked\" into some sort of video game console to another world, and have problems to figure out in that world or dimension. As you make progress with the story, you encounter various challenges and problems to overcome. More stuff seems to unlock as you get to different parts of the game too.\n\nThe game contains NUDITY (like the big letters?), and that's probably a good disclaimer for anyone that wants to steer clear of that sort of thing. It's, of course, within the general Steam guidelines for most games, with hair or other things blocking out the full views to keep it from being FULL-FLEDGED NUDITY (couldn't help myself). A little off topic, but I've always wondered about the double standard with NUDITY as opposed to violence and gore, the latter having just about any and everything in this unnatural violent realm tolerated completely, while something more natural in the sexual realm that has to do with the reason people even exist in the first place to be able to censor and filter stuff out... is filtered and censored.  Don't get me wrong, I like both, but only one gets a completely free pass.\n\nOverall, what I've noticed is that the combat system is similar to Re;Birth 1, which is the only one I had a lot of experience in. The combo system is to a certain extent, different than part 1 in a few ways though, since you can set up your combos to work together and have similar traits. If the next move of a combo follows the appropriate rule (trait) when you set it up, it will have a sort of glow around it, letting you know the move is going to hit harder and not miss.  Something I notice as different was the EXE drive, and the way it builds.  It doesn't stay up after you battle and build it, as it did in the first game. It resets after a battle ends. It builds a lot faster though, so maybe not such a bad tradeoff.  Another difference in this game is the random encounters as you travel the \"nodes\" from one area to another. You can get randomly attacked as you move around. You cannot gain your Life/SP back either on save points, which is another difference.  Only crossing the nodes at towns is it possible to regain health and SP for free, from what I have seen, aside from using items, which isn't exactly free anyway.\n\nCustomization in the game is huge! I enjoy all the options you have in town, with scouts, the share system, and development and investment as you progress.  \n\nSpeaking of towns, there are a lot of options available once you get far enough into the game.  Investment in three categories: Commerce, Industrial, and Public Relations.  You simply contribute money into the desired category until it levels up. Development is the finding of plans, either through the Industrial investment route or in the game, where you must find materials listed and then fuse or syntesize those materials to get a brand new one.\n\nYou can also create discs, which give you bonus attributes.  They can be reformatted as well, and you will be able to keep the old Idea Chips you add to them.  Idea chips are explained in-game a bit. You can create Godly or Sucky discs, which give a bonus effect. Most of them are not as good as what you could create on your own later for certain situations, but some have a nice extra ability.\n\nThe scouts are fun to use, and you can send them into dungeons you've already been to or discovered, and they will report back every x amount of minutes based on the dungeon with either items, money, nothing at all, new scouts, new enemies, or discovery of a new dungeon. Had to remove more explanation in depth because of text limit on my review.\n\nTwo other things you can do from town are Route Building and Guild. Guild allows you to take on quests, and those are important for raising shares, gaining items or money, or allowing other dialogue to appear in town by picking the Converse tab. Not going into detail with Gallery or Converse, because I am running out of room for my review.\n\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n\nBattle system is easy to get used to.  If you've played any of the other main games (Re;Birth 1, 2, 3), then this is pretty much the same as those have been, with a few tweaks here and there.\n\nThey have individual challenges that are fun to complete.  They can be viewed in library/challenges from the menu to see what all you can do, how much progress you have made, and what you gain for meeting the requirements. You gain small bonuses for completing them with different characters.\n\nHumor in story is nice and light-hearted and keeps everything upbeat. I like how seriously non-serious it tends to be.  Neptune is very naive, and says some really ridiculous things from time to time. Many have certain personalities that can clash or become stronger together depending on the situation.\n\nLarge variety of different things to customize, change and/or level up, as I mentioned above.\n\nController works well in general, but I had to swap a few buttons out and remap some stuff to have it work for me.  Good now though.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\nThe music in the dialogue can get very repetitive, but it is a minor gripe since it's fairly low and not the focal point.  It will change based on the mood of the conversation.\n\nTheir voices can bother you after a while of hearing them, especially when changing to the menu screen or in fights, since there are only a few things each will say. I would enjoy a deeper amount of commentary upon switching screens and fighting.\n\nThe controller stick and pad move way to fast in battles trying to get precise adjustments. It used to be a lot easier to place my attacks in battle right where I wanted them, but the movement speed of the attack area is extremely hard to get right on this one, so it takes me a while sometimes if I want to hit several targets that are more spaced out by just getting the edges of my range to touch each one...\n\n[b]A few issues that might be only related to my own system:[/b]\n\nMusic will occasionally \"flare up\" very loud for a split second upon starting up. Some popping occasionally too, almost the same as the flares, just initially on staring of a new voice or sound.\n\nOn the map, there is some delay after the battles end for me. I see the picture freeze for a couple of seconds.\n\nThere have been a few small grammatical errors in the text as I was reading along. Someone should hire me to go through all the lines of text and get these kinds of things right, since I pay a lot of attention to detail!\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThere are very few things I can really say beyond some of the repetitive sounds that make this game anything less than a spectacular game to play! I would advise playing 1, 2, and 3 first if possible, or start with one of those to see if you like the game series before jumping into this one. If you've already played them and like them, then this is a must have to add to the collection! That said, this is a totally different game in and of itself with simply references to the other games.  You don't have to worry about anything being spoiled from the others if you play this first, from what I can tell so far. Everyone from the other games is sort of explained a bit, so you have a basic idea of who people are, and why they are in the game with Neptune.\n\nThe story is kind of silly, but intriguing. So far I am unsure of where it is going, but I'm definitely going to continue playing. Lots of strange and interesting encounters. I highly recommend playing this one, or another from the series!

It'll likely take me three days to write this review since there's so much I want to talk about that will make you want to buy this game.\nThis is the fourth game in the main series and vastly improves so much from previous games, in fact, taking inspiration from other Compile Heart games like Fairy Fencer F.\nCombat UI is improved and simplified. Now all your important commands are in a menu when you press Y on the controller (O on Keyboard). Enemies no longer have Guard Points, so you're free to wham them down with any move. However, now movement plays a much bigger role since enemies now have destroyable parts in certain areas (Think Xenoblade Chronicles X). Destroying a part will change the tide of the field and earn you more EXP, Credits, and rare items. Formation Skills are now done by surrounding or pinching the enemy, though be careful of attacks that have knockback or you might mess up your strategy. Movement also plays a major role in Giant Battles, battles where you face colossi in floating platforms that you can jump from one to another making the best use of the new mechanics.\nThe game also brings back Scouting, the original form of Stella's Dungeon, from the original Victory game, which lets you give boosts in item drop chances, recovery, and change enemies. You can level up your scouts using EnergyMate which lets them scout dungeons longer than normal and have better chances of finding materials, credits, new scouts, and dungeons. With materials, you can develop these items similar to Hyperdevotion Noire and not like the ones in the Re;Birth trilogy. This time they actually give you the end product. Money also plays a big role since now, there's Route Building which lets you build paths to new dungeons, and Investment, which lets you boost shares, and earn new items and development plans (think Xenoblade Chronicles X again, but easier to manage).\nIf your scout was able to unlock the Neplunker stages, you're treated to a little minigame based on the classic video game, Spelunker. If you've played the original, you control your character in a cave, trying to jump your way carefully from platform to platform, while managing your stamina, and earning speed boosts, and avoiding obstacles like enemies and steam. Just like the original, Neplunker is not easy at all. In fact, some areas are a little too precise and the collision detection is a little dicey. And be careful when you jump, even waist high falls can spell your doom. Make sure you're not using the Jumping Star flag when you're in there. Personally, it's the only thing I don't like in this game, especially if you lose all your lives and you're kicked back to the title screen (unless you're in new game plus, where you get kicked back to the map).\nMeanwhile, quests return, and this time, you're now limited to quests of ranking available to you. If you can clear a promotional quest, you get a rank up and can do more quests that way. Quests, as always, reward you with money and items, and also boost shares for select nations. Shares, this time, mean so much. To get what I'm saying, try not to die too often as a CPU or candidate beginning in Episode 2 of this game.\nOh, did I say episode there? Well... this game is divided into three episodes. But don't worry, there's no Episode Pass for you to buy separately. All three episodes make up the ginormous story of Megadimension Neptunia VII. From the dark and gloomy world of Zerodimension, to the cheery world taken over by a mysterious force in Hyperdimension, all the way to an apocalyptic end in Heartdimension, this is a truly big and incredibly well-written story. You'll love the characters, old and new, from Uzume to Big Neptune, and also the tension, the feels, the atmosphere. This is all grandoise.\nTo accompany all this, new art and graphics show the worlds excellently. The new Visual Novel sprites are a fresh new coat of paint. They have better animations, expressions, and better detail too. Some of the backgrounds are animated too giving the scene life. You'll also love the CGs in this game, especially those with \"incredible goods.\" Graphics are a step up from previous games, and the game offers brand new environments that show that, from the destroyed cities, to sakura parks, and outer space (have fun with Rocket Jump there). 3D models also have brand new animations as well, and are much better to look at too. Some of my favourites include Neptune, Uzume, Nowa, Vert, and Uni (hehe cute handgun pose).\nThe music is incredible. Even if some of the music comes from older games, the game brings brand new music that's incredible and great to listen to. They are great for each of the situation they fit in. In fact, the music quality is as great as the series's anime adaptation's soundtrack. It's so good that they're even offering the soundtrack in the Digital Deluxe Set so that you can listen to it anytime you want.\nIn the end, this game, is amazing. It's the best Neptunia game to date so far and fans of the series will love this game so much. Idea Factory and Compile Heart spent a lot of time making this game and they showed Nepu at her finest. This is a monument Compa and Iffy have created, and will be remembered for a long time.

I have a NVIDIA GeForce 970 Graphics Card, something that goes above recommended status, so I assumed it would be enough... wrong. For a good chunk of my time, I had to play at such a staggeringly low FPS that it was downright painful to my eyes. So for a while, i left the game alone, assumed Idea Factory wouldn't bother updating it, much like the Naruto Ninja Storm Series, and moved on with my life... boy am I glad to be wrong.\nThese guys took their customers' gripes about performance issues, and fixed it... already, that's something basic that SO many people in the gaming market neglect to do; listening to your customers is the most important thing. If you can't do that much, then already you're alienating your buyers.

What I'd like to answer to in this review is if this is true or not: well, my answer is... yes and no. I'll try to explain why.\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nYou could think that the story is the truly forte of the game but I don't think so and the reason is quite simple. Neptunia is a game based on strong comedy and citationism. Lots of series gave to us an important lesson: to never distort the core of a product is basilar. The story could seems alluring and \"cool\" to the player because the Zero Dimension arc is well done and it gives a serious and dark tone/start to the game (pretty much as the Mk2). I'm ok with darker stories but only if you can manage to write them and this is not the case. You can really see that the original project was way wider than this. Unfortunately the Heart Dimension is too condensed and the \"now cry\" situation is elicited in a dull way.\nIt's clear to me that the guys who wrote the Neptunia's stuff are better with comedy and demential situation. The script was the flattest in the series, full of clich\u00e9 and unispired dialogues and that's a shame. I'd like to write more thoroughly but I don't want to be boring.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nI really liked the new combat system, now that you have to choose the right abilities and the correct links between them, the game has a new depth but they still need to polish up the skills because in the first part of the game they can make you OP but than they become pretty useless. I'm also happy because now there are more dungeons where the jumps make sense but I can see that the budget it's still low, in fact they recycled more or less 60-70% of the stuff, I think. But I know that they're trying to improve the quality so I'll be not fussy on this.\n\n[h1]Music:[/h1]\nTotally loved it! Unfortunately I don't like so much the battle theme, the normal boss theme and the Hyperdimension map theme but the soundtrack is one of the better of the franchise if you ask me. \n\n[h1]Characters:[/h1]\nHere I'll talk only of the new characters. \nUzume is probably my new best CPU so I don't need to add other things! XD I really liked the Gold Third, they are pretty cool but their first appearance is... stupid. Their role in the story isn't so much better because it's redundant after all if you think about it. But I like the design, the personality and other things about them and they are not useless like the other secondary characters from the other Neptunia games at least so I can connect to a deeper emotional level with them. Nep is love so the more, the merrier. Oh... and Umio is best girl of course lol. Affimojas and Steamax are funny, ok, but the robots from the first Victory were way cooler. Anonydeath, Copypaste... Please guys, there's no match. The \"final boss\" is poorly portrayed and almost always in an indirect way. I already mentioned the problem in the Heart Dimension, right? Same issue here.\n\n[h1]Longevity:[/h1]\nWell, this is the longest game of the series probably and you'll play a lot if you want to obtain all the achievements. If you want to read the true ending on your first walkthrough you'll probably play for 35-45 hours.\n\n[h1]Porting:[/h1]\nNOW it's a good porting but if you have Radeon Graphics be aware that you could have problems (for example I had bothers with the shadows and I had to turn them off). And you need a more powerful system to play Megadimension, the game can lag hard with the Next Forms on or against... err... some bosses.\n\nSo this is probably the best title of Neptunia, so far. I liked everything more or less but the story is the weak point because it's not the classic style and for me it fails to convey the same feelings that, for example, the first Victory sent successfully to me. I obviously recommend Megadimension Neptunia VII to all of its fans.\n\nGuru Guru Dreams~", "timestamp_created": 1470784246, "timestamp_updated": 1470844151, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5,

Finally a good story that has humor AND tragedy, They finally combined those two to make this, thanks to Neptunia mk2 and Victory they found the way to have both comedy and serious events.\n\n-Uzume, a great character added to the game with a strong story that reflects one of the best consoles ever made.\n\n-The New Game plus is wayyyyy better then before, having access to all sorts of options (Keeping the characters, levels, etc) \n\n-The enemies. Arfoire isn't the worst character ever now, she's still not taken seriously but there's a reason AND she finally knows how to be a baddie, finally the old hag is competent\n\n\n     Cons : \n-The map, even if you access a certain item later in the game where you can't find monsters in the map anymore, it's STILL annoying, I've also been unlucky meeting monsters every time, and it's annoying when it had to load the fight and load the map again, i've lost a lot of time with these ^^'. The old Neptunia style was better.\n\n-A bug I encountered (gladly fixed) where my game would play at 5 fps, I had to search deeply in some forums and videos to find the solution, so watch out with some NVidia graphics cards.\n\n-Some DLC are really expensive for the few content they add (not the character ones)\n\n-Another bug (fixed again) where some weapons were invisible and the Metallic Garbacho would be invisible too\n\n-Croire (the biggest douche in the game)\n\n\n     In conclusion the game is good, the few cons they are are nothing compared to the content of the game, I may have meant that the bugs were annoying but it's still a great game and they are now fixed, it was my experience and I hope you don't have them either, with that said I gladly recommend this game.\n\n

However I just can't bring myself to, this game just feels like a empty shell, Sure it has the Blanctunia character's and theme. When I play it thought it just feel's like it's lacking soul, the spark that I felt in every other Blanctunia game that would make me feel happy. When I play this game it does not feel authentic to me, like its just a bland grey husk of the older game's. So far I have finshed the first part and started the second. I was very disappointed in the lack of content such as no side quest's as well as how short the first part was in general, not to mention how easy the combat is. The combat is dumbed down to the point were it's just unenjoyable now. ( I have found this to be a recurring issue as the Blanctunia game's have gone on ) Granted later on in the second part you can do side quests.  I would say the one saving grace of this game aside from Blanc being in it is the soundtrack! the soundtrack in this game is great I cant get enough of it. Sadly thats were my love for this game dies. I will do my Blanny Blanny Best to try and finsh this game bit by bit to see if I am wrong. However as of right now I can't recommend this game. As for the pervious blanctuia game's like the orginal, and the first two rebirth's I would recommend them becuase they were alot more enjoyable and had much better combat.", "timestamp_created": 1470247114, "timestamp_updated": 1470247114, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.397910", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24692062": {"recommendationid": "24692062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198199843722", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469686121}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u65e5\u5446\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u51fa\u5b98\u65b9\u4e2d\u6587", "timestamp_created": 1470239706, "timestamp_updated": 1470239706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24689617": {"recommendationid": "24689617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174657626", "num_games_owned": 376, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 5141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472887580}, "language": "english", "review": "I noticed I have not done a review for this game. I shall now do one like I usually do with previous Nep games! :3\n\nNormally, I would write a chunk in my review but this time, I'll \"try\" to summarise it overall. Personally, Megadimension Neptunia VII is probably the best installment so far for the series along with RB1 and RB3 as my favourites. I'm actually surprised that despite the minimum requirements, I am able to run this on a Surface Pro 3. However, the newer dungeons, Dark CPU, NEXT Forms and animations for skills/EXEs were rather laggy. Everything else ran suitably enough to play. There are still a bunch of re-used dungeons from previous games but that does not matter. Monsters seem to be different, more variety and some are re-colours. In regards to gameplay, I liked how they tried to make it more challenging in a way such as the one dungeon with no map and only those in battle get EXP which may cause underlevels for some late game. I quite liked the hidden treasures, figurine/card collector achievements. It gives the game a new touch for not being as repetitive. Uniquely, I think they were also added to balance out the grindy achievements such as the good ol' classic lily rank achievements we've been getting the past installments which are much easier to max in VII. I liked the new soundtrack, the CG that is avaiable and reading the events to know more about the characters. One memorable one I'm quite fond of is the matching hats event between Histy and Uzume ^^ Other miscellaneous things I liked were the costumes and accessories, in particular IF and Compa as they finally have another outfit!\n\nWould I nepping recommend this? If you're a nep fan, played a previous nep game then yes. If you're new I'd say, give it a go! Though I'm not sure if you should start with this one. Personally I would say to try RB1 to know what this game is about and it's concept. If not, then start with RB3 ^^", "timestamp_created": 1470230504, "timestamp_updated": 1470230504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.735736",

Megadimension Neptunia VII...\nEigentlich mag ich ja die Serie, aber das ist f\u00fcr mich kein Grund hier nun einen Daumen hoch zu geben...\n\nMegadimension Neptunia VII macht einiges gut, einiges besser, aber eben auch einiges falsch.\n\nDiesmal ist in diesem Teil die Musik richtig gut gelungen, auch wenn ich lieber den alten Soundtrack bei EXE Drives bevorzuge... aber nun, gut... kann ich mit leben...\n\nZum Teil gef\u00e4llt mir das neue Kampfsystem weil es viel mehr auf Combos gehen soll, ABER... dadurch dass man mit Rush-Angriffen seine EXE-Bar zu schnell auff\u00fcllt, endet es in einem Spammen von EXE-Drives und EXE-Farming durch Rush-Angriffen.\n\nAuch ein Teil der neuen Dungeons gef\u00e4llt mir, wie beispielsweise ein Kirschwald, der gerade in der Zeit der Bl\u00fche ist. Kurz gesagt sehen ein Teil der neuen Dungeon echt gut aus und f\u00fchlen sich auch Atmosph\u00e4risch an. Allerdings ist da auch das krasse Gegenteil bei einem Teil der neuen Dungeon die sich schon wie ein Platzhalter f\u00fcr ein nicht fertig gewordenes Design anf\u00fchlen. Ebenso sind viele Dungeons fast 1:1 aus den vorherigen Teilen \u00fcbernommen worden.\n\nWas mir nun wiederum direkt nicht gef\u00e4llt ist die Charakterverteilung \u00fcber die Story, denn im ersten und zweiten Teil der Story kommt man nur selten an eine unglaubliche Zahl von 4 Charakteren in der Nep-party. Dabei hat man bis zu 8 Charaktere die bei K\u00e4mpfen direkt und indirekt mitwirken. Juhu... da kommt eine tolle Leere auf...\nWenn ich schon bei den Charakteren bin, viele \"alte\" Charaktere wie beispielsweise MAGES. , Peashy oder MarvelousAQL, wurden rausgenommen um Platz f\u00fcr neue - f\u00fcr mich unsympatische - Charaktere zu machen. \n\nAuch f\u00fcr die Katz, ist das Leveling-System. \u00c4hnlich wie bei Fairy Fencer F bekommen grundlegend nur die, die beim Kampf aktiv dabei sind EXP. Das ist bei einer Charakteranzahl wie man sie in Neptunia-Spielen am Ende hat ung\u00fcnstig. Dann kommt aber auch noch der nonsense hinzu dass ein Teil der Charaktere die passive F\u00e4higkeit \"Learning\" haben (den Rest dazu kann man sich denken). Ansonsten kann man noch Games im Spiel erstellen die die \"Learning\" F\u00e4higkeit enthalten, aber daf\u00fcr gibt es zu wenig Datentr\u00e4ger die den Skill haben k\u00f6nnen...\n\nEbenfalls schlecht ist die World-map, bei der man nicht mehr frei zu den Dungeon gehen kann sondern erstmal \u00fcber Routen sich dorthin bewegen muss und dabei man in viel zu einfache Zufallsk\u00e4mpfe verwickelt wird... f\u00fchlt sich insgesamt nach einer Ma\u00dfnahme an, bei der die Spielzeit gestreckt werden soll. Dadurch zieht sich die Story zu sehr in die L\u00e4nge und man kann die Lust daran verlieren, Megadimension Neptunia VII weiterspielen zu wollen (so wie ich).\n\nZuallerletzt w\u00e4re da noch das Interface. Ein paar der \u00c4nderungen vom optischen her gefallen mir, andere nicht so ganz, ABER in Sachen Funktionalit\u00e4t ist es einen Schritt zur\u00fcckgegangen. Es ist jetzt aus meiner Sicht wieder auf der Ebene von Re;Birth 1 oder Re;Birth 2. Das Feature Informationen zu Items oder Monstern die man in Quests sammeln bzw. besiegen soll, wurde rausgenommen... und genau das Feature hat mir bei Re;Birth 3 so ziemlich gut gefallen, weil ich nicht mehr auf ein Wiki angewiesen bin / war.\n\nNun... was soll ich sagen... Megadimension Neptunia VII ist f\u00fcr mich einfach eine Entt\u00e4uschung... Ich wei\u00df jetzt auch nicht wirklich wie ich das in Worte fassen soll. Zum Teil vor allem durch das Kampfsystem gef\u00e4llt es mir, aber dann kommen die unausgefeilten Details hervor die einem den Spielspa\u00df vermasseln. Leider zieht sich dann auch noch in dem Frust die Story auch zu sehr in die L\u00e4nge, sodass mir jedenfalls im dritten Teil mir die Lust vergangen ist. \nSollte ich das Spiel im Vergleich zu den Neptunia-Teilen in ein Ranking setzen, ist dieses hier auf dem letzten Platz. Da finde ich selbst das Conquest-Ende aus Re;Birth 2 besser...", "timestamp_created": 1469891132, "timestamp_updated": 1469891132, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24612996": {"recommendationid": "24612996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046820978", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 4681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509358058}, "language": "english", "review": "I have to say that this game is good for what it is. This is the first time I have played a game like this before. I have never played the neptunia franchise before, just saw it on my steam recommended list on sale and I decided to give it a try as I was really bored. Boy was I really surprised in a good and bad way.\n\n[h1]Summary for those who do not want to read my wall of text:[/h1]\n\n[b]Optimization:4/10[/b] (I run the game maxed out with DOF and AA turned off at 1080p, It runs ok for my nvidia card which is a 950m (mostly 60fps, lowest 30 fps), but for my amd card which is a R9 290 to drop frames below 30 is just bad. The R9 290 is way more powerful than the 950m, this is unacceptable. Maybe it is the cpu as I have an fx 6300 for my R9 290 but an i7 6700HQ for the 950m. Or it could just be the SSD in my 950m laptop compared to my slow ass HDD in my R9 290 pc. Idk which hardware is causing frame drops the most on my pc hardware but I assume this game has bad optimization for amd cards and maybe even cpus as the cpu they list on the recommended specs does not even has its model number listed and there are no amd cards listed.\n\n[b]3D Graphics: 5/10[/b] (Passable, low quality textures, asset and polygon count, atrocious AA, good quality character models, nice looking enviroment)\n\n[b]3D Animation/Physics: 2/10[/b] (Some really odd animations and the physics is just well, pretty flat. The physics in the game feels very dated)\n\n[b]2D Graphics: 10/10[/b] (Just wow)\n\n[b]2D Animation: 9/10[/b] (Nice breathing, mouth and eye animations, the intros/outros are very well made)\n\n[b]Soundtrack: 9/10[/b] (minus 1 for a few poorly mastered tracks)\n\n[b]Plot/Story: 7/10[/b] (I mostly enjoyed it, slightly overwhelming and kinda cliche and redundant plots at the start. Managed to predict quite a few times what will happen next quite well in the first arc. It took about 40-50 hours for a noob like me with hax)\n\n[b]Girls: 7/10 [/b](All of them are fairly unique from each other, I really like most of the girls, interesting designs. However, some of the girls suck in thier abilites and stats compared to others. Not balanced properly)\n\n[b]Memes/References: 8/10[/b] (Pretty funny memes and references)\n\n[b]DLC: ?/10[/b] (Yup this game has DLC built in and you can buy it if you want. It also has a \"free dlc\" that you have to manually activate. I have no idea how the DLC changes the gameplay much other than making the game way easier, adding new characters or cosmetic items that don't actually add more playable content for the game. This is not a review for the DLC, I don't own any of them.)\n\n[b]Overall Rating: 7/10[/b] (Highly recommend to anyone new to this series to start on this masterpiece and not play their old games which in my opinion sucks mostly in the graphic and interface department from trying out rebirth 3 on my friend\u2019s laptop. Looking at the other older games interface and graphics on youtube makes me wanna puke too.)\n\n\n[h1]Now for the wall of text:[/h1]\n\nI was about to rate the game poorly by the shit graphics (3D not 2D), subpar optimization, insane tearing with vsync off, 60fps lock I think, low quality environment textures, awful controls that are meant for controllers and the fact that the keys you bind for the different console buttons in the game do not change at all in the UI. The graphic options are basically shit. AA is terrible (more like a blur filter turned on) DOF that has no point other than to blur the edges of the screen. Basically, I was not impressed with the 3D graphic options.\n\nI'm lucky that I played on a console before and got used to the controls fast once I remembered which keys were bind to the buttons on a controller. I have already put a guide out on steam for on the optimal key bindings for those that do not have a controller and would like to play on a keyboard (you actually don't need a controller; game plays really well on a keyboard surprisingly). Once the issue of controlling the game is out, I have been enjoying the game very much from start to finish. I played the game with them voicing in Japanese because I just feel it\u2019s weird if they speak English (I always prefer sub over dub ye)\n\nThe game takes about 40 hours to complete, for a total newb reading up on what to do as recommended by a guide and skipping all the side quests that are not mandatory to continue the main story. The 2D art and UI is top notch, plenty of detail and animation, excellent quality here. The dialogue can be really funny, sad or even disturbing at times. The writing is mostly good, with a few parts that are awkward,cringey or just flat out redundant. The first arc is the worst out of all of them. I would describe the story as sort of watching an anime with 3 seasons in it. All of the 3 seasons are mostly awesome and I keep wanting to know what will happen next. I was slightly overwhelmed when they were explaining the story to me at the start but other than that, I really enjoyed the story. I really liked all of the girls, its hard to select just one.\n\nI really liked the cool (sometimes really funny) skills, EXE skills and formation skills which I feel is the most disappointing compared with the regular and EXE skills. The micromanagement for the skill combo\u2019s, formation and equipping all the weapons, outfits are mildly satisfying. The girls are really cute and cool and this was one of the key factors that kept me going at the start of the game. (You can thank Neptune and Uzume for that). The next gen forms are really cool (other than vert\u2019s hers is well not as developed as the rest) and so are all the characters that you can play as in this game. I\u2019m always wanting to find out what their special skills are and what are the positives and negatives of each girl.\n\nThe maps are mostly like typical dungeons you see in typical RPG games, ranging from dark and spooky to colourful and happy dungeons. The monsters just roam around and if you hit them (or they hit you) you initiate a fight. Saving in this game is punishing, (well for someone who is used to saving anytime I want) you can only save after you are out of a dungeon or close to the end of a dungeon. One thing that really annoyed me was the fact that some treasures in a dungeon require you to acquire items to break the boxes blocking your way. The feeling of a stupid treasure stuck there because you can see it but can\u2019t get it is really infuriating. Luckily the guide helped me out and I continued the game without rage quitting.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is just amazing. I never really bothered about most in game soundtracks at but all the ones in this game are really good. No words can say how good it is. Just listen to it yourself. Fits the theme of wherever you are pretty well. The sound design of most of the tracks are excellent. Nice sound staging, you can hear all the different instruments clearly and at different places. Also, neplunker I swear is rage inducing if you did not watch a guide and did the stupidest platforming for 30 mins dying for no reason at all due to bad coding.\n\nI have not finished everything about the game, I just got the true ending (with a lot of raging as I needed to have an extra playthrough as I missed out something, good to see that there was more content in the true ending) and there is quite a bit more content compared to the other endings in the game (bad and good). Only fault I can see here is that the two other endings are lacking and they use the same exact outro video. I feel that they could have done more in making the other two endings more fleshed out and have more reason to go for that ending (especially the bad ending). Other than that, I genuinely enjoyed this game and I would recommend it to anyone new to this kind of genre or franchise.", "timestamp_created": 1469878054, "timestamp_updated": 1506920511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24599632": {"recommendationid": "24599632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031347508", "num_games_owned": 322, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 5439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501024479}, "language": "english", "review": "The magnum opus of nepu-nepu, now with an even bigger pool of high quality waifus to choose from.", "timestamp_created": 1469813760, "timestamp_updated": 1469813760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24598111": {"recommendationid": "24598111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097353459", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469861239}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6bd4\u8d77\u624b\u6e38\u65e0\u9650\u6c2a\u91d1\u8fd8\u62bd\u4e0d\u5230\u4e00\u5f20SR\u5361\u8fd8\u8981\u53ef\u6015\u7684\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u2014\u2014\u7ed9\u4f60\u65e0\u9650SL\u8fd8\u62bd\u4e0d\u5230\u56db\u5f20SR\u5361\u91cc\u7684\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u5f20", "timestamp_created": 1469807923, "timestamp_updated": 1469807923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629630", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24578249": {"recommendationid": "24578249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063728808", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 2596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500044695}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Esse Neptunia conseguiu me surpreender do inicio ao fim, ele \u00e9 bem diferente dos outros em quest\u00e3o de gameplay, parece at\u00e9 mesmo outro jogo, por exemplo em v\u00e1rios lugares voc\u00ea ir\u00e1 precisar pular, nos outros o pulo tava l\u00e1 de enfeite.A hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 meio s\u00e9ria, fiquei at\u00e9 surpreso com a tens\u00e3o da primeira parte da hist\u00f3ria, a hist\u00f3ria desse jogo \u00e9 a melhor de todos os Neptunia's em minha opini\u00e3o.

They are sort of creaky and poor quality overall.\n-All skills got a huge nerf, now you can easy outdamage them with combos. Now they are only usefull in battles with dark CPUs. And now you have sh!t ton of formation skills and drives with very short (KA-BOOM) cut-in scene (You can't even see your favorite cpu in this).\n-Colosseum now is pain in the ass and don't provide any usefull endgame materials/weapons.\n-Weapons.

Gone are the days of spaming Mega-D Drive and Near Canopus, and in are varied combos and unique strings of attacks. The back line also becomes more useful as using the Switch command no longer counts as an end action, which lets you reach enemies from further away or immediately get access to a more useful character without having to waste a turn. My only other gripe is that Processors got nerfed to the point of pretty much being cosmetic once you get to higher levels.\n\nSo what's good about VII? Pretty much everything else.

The classical humor and jokes from the cast are still here, and you'll see why there's alot of memes around this series as a whole.\n\nPresentation wise, this game is gorgeous, the artists did a really good job in to presenting the world your traversing through, the world looks vast and each dimension has its own unique atmosphere which correlates to the story in some way may it be Dark, Vibrant and Colorful or Sorrowful, you'll see these themes present as you play.\n\nAs for the gameplay, Megadimension rehashed alot of its gameplay elements from the previous titles, the overworld has been changed to give the overworld substance in between fighting and progressing the plot. And speaking of combat it has been redone in a way that scraps old mechanics in favor of new ones, some may see this as repetitive throughout the game but this is to be expected in a JRPG.\n\nSound is one of the major things this game is being praised for as it should, like everything else the music is miles better than its predecessors and the sound effects is very crisp and satisfying, from the Opening Title Theme to the Ending Credits Theme, I assure there will points where you will just drop everything in order to listen to the music, though be forewarned with your volume settings because some parts of this game doesn't know when to be loud or not.\n\nAll in all, Megadimension Neptunia VII is delivered nicely and is very welcoming to newcomers of the series, everything here is done miles better than what its previous titles did, and for the hefty price and hardware required this game is all worth your time and money, assuming you like dorky protagonists and anime girls but just don't delve into spoiler terrority before picking this up to ensure you get the full experience this game has to offer.", "timestamp_created": 1469528668, "timestamp_updated": 1479992681, "voted_up":

Zero Dimension, Hyperdimension and Heart Dimension. Each story/dimension had it's own feel which made it feel like 3 different games, however keeping true to the Neptunia series. Zero Dimension was in my opinion one of the better stories solely off of how it was told. It was a lot more serious, has a more darker story behind it and you actually worry about the survival of the characters during this story, that is how well it was written. Hyperdimension wasn't as serious as Zero Dimension, Hyperdimension kept more of the aspect of keeping the randomness, the jokes, the 4th wall breaking that is a staple of the Neptunia series. Heart Dimension was a pretty good closer as well. The story felt mixed with Zero Dimension and Hyperdimension but there was a lot more twists in Heart Dimension. I always thought Re;Birth 2 had the more serious story but Megadimension took that over easily. I would go as far to say that this has so far been the best story out of the series and I truthfully enjoyed Re;Birth's 3 story more than any of the previous games as I felt it covered a lot more, but once against Megadimension toppled that.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nUpon starting the game, you will notice quite an upgrade in graphics. Movies look a lot more smoother and stable, the menu and UI look a lot more sleeker, the artwork and text box in the visual novel parts of the game look a lot more crisper and higher quality and the actual gameplay looks and feels a lot better. Animation looping is also a lot more smoother than previous games. The CG in this game also got quite an increase in quality and detail, some of which look stunning.\n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\n\nThis soundtrack was phenomenal. OST in games is always something that is a huge importance to me and the Neptunia series has always had a good amount OST that I enjoyed listening to while playing the game. Megadimension has a new OST while keeping previous music from other games. The new OST I feel they went above and really did a fantastic job on it. Every dimension has their own version of music, be that the over-world, in the dungeon(s) or enemy battles and they did a great job of getting those soundtracks to match the feel of that dimension.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nSome new things have been added to gameplay. \n\n- The Guard Break from previous games is now changed to Part Break in which certain areas of an enemy are guarded that need to be broken to deal more damage, such as their head, behind them, their sides. There is no longer a Break attack, it is just a Standard attack. Attacking an enemy with Parts on it will be be broken overtime regardless of the moves used against them. \n\n- The over-world has changed completely. You no longer freely pick where you want to go, instead it's mapped out and you travel to the places (best compared to like Super Mario 3 over-world.) Upon traveling to a place in the over-world you have a chance to encounter a battle. This is completely random as you can encounter enemies every 2 steps or you can run the whole map and not fight a single enemy. This can become repetitive as the enemies become weak as you level up, their EXP and credit drop stops being worth it and you may just want to get to somewhere quicker. After you beat the game and start NG+, you get an item that lets you disable or enable random encounters in the over-world.\n\n- Scouts make a return again but this time a little different, however a lot better in my opinion. The new scouting system works similar to the Fury system in Fairy Fencer F. You select a scout or scouts and send them to a dungeon or split them up into multiple dungeons. Each scout has a dungeon effect be that a positive or negative effect. Such as +10% credits and -5% EXP. The scouts run on a timer to complete a dungeon and when they return they will bring you items from the enemies there, credits, a chance at a new dungeon for you the explore, a chance for a new scout or scouts to join, a hidden treasure hint and will find 2 new enemies for you to battle, which are bosses. The hidden treasure hint is how to get a hidden treasure for that dungeon only. There are certain steps you have to do in order to complete that one hit such as win 5 battles without healing, win against 5 dogoos in a row, ect. One thing you will find from a good portion of hidden treasures is an item called Energy Mate, which is used to level up your scouts. The higher level your scouts are, the more items and credits they will find, as well as the chances for scouts to join. \n\n- Combo Trait is a new feature added to your attacks. Before each attack, you may notice that one or more attacks may be glowing, that is how you start the combo train. When using this, all attacks for that combo will always hit and will always be critical hits.\n\n- The EX Finish is no longer here in the form of a combo like in previous games. Instead there is now Coupling Skills, which when you get the required EXE, in your skill menu you can use the Coupling Skill. There is also now Formation Skills which work by having certain party members in the battle in a certain formation to use a skill. They all have to be in normal or HDD forms for them to work.\n\nExample: Neptune and Nepgear in a battle, both must be in HDD or in their normal forms. One cannot be HDD and normal at the same time for it to work. You can have a 4 person formation attack, however the same applies they must all be in HDD or normal form and you must make the correct form (on the skill page you may have to be in a triangle formation for a 3 person attack, a square for 4 person attack or \"sandwich\" an enemy for a 2 person attack\n\n[h1]Some Cons[/h1]\n- When in the skill menu during a battle, I have noticed that when cycling through the skills quickly, I get some slight frame drops (my hardware is not the issue.) \n\n- Random encounters. As I mentioned above with the over-world, random encounters can become repetitive. I have the item that stops that, however until then, the endgame was getting a little tedious with all the random encounters.\n\n\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\nStory: Very well written, serious moments while keeping true to the Neptune series of having funny and random moments.\nGraphics: Graphics look a lot cleaner and smoother than the previous games. Looping animation is also a lot smoother than previous games.\nSoundtrack: Honestly, one of the better OSTs I've heard in a while, they really stepped it up big.\nGameplay: A lot of new stuff added which adds to the experience of the game.\nNeptune: [spoiler] She's the protagonist and will break the 4th wall to tell you multiple times[/spoiler]  \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nIf you have been a fan of the Neptunia series or you like JRPG's in general, definitely give this game a go. The price might push some away, but it's honestly worth with the amount they included into this game. The story is honestly worth getting into and like I stated above, there's a lot of humour, seriousness and plot twists. They really outdid themselves with this story and I really enjoyed this story and game in general. If you haven't played Re;Birth2 or Re;Birth 3, there will be multiple references you won't get, however that will not make it so you can't play the game at all, you can jump into this game as your first Neptunia game and still play the game no problem, learn slightly about previous games and that always gives you the headroom for going back to play the previous ones. If you get the DLC and don't want to make the game too easy, I would use it after you beat the game once. A lot of the weapons and armour make the game way too easy. \n\nI would highly recommend as a purchase!", "timestamp_created": 1469392631, "timestamp_updated": 1469395011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706977", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24506196": {"recommendationid": "24506196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075572765", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508534046}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Game i Ever played just play and see it for yourself", "timestamp_created": 1469391457, "timestamp_updated": 1469391457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24501581": {"recommendationid": "24501581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056997677", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476724492}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "It's a nep game, what should i say?

I would have selected that if I could have.\n\nI hate to admit it but this one is the weakest of the main series.  Anyway instead of going on a rant im just going to put my \"review\" in a listed format.\n\nThe Good:\n\n1)  The new battle system, damn its pretty damn awesome.  While I'll admit I didnt like some of the changes (like the whole being unable  to switch characters while ko'ed like rebirth 3 and status ailements not disappearing after battles)  it actually seems like a fair challange now.  (compaired to rebirth one and two which were cake walks, and three which had regenerating bosses (which is a pet peave of mine)) \n\n2)  The dungeons.  Guess what!  The dungeons are actually interesting now.  Theres platforming and mazes and its all kind of fun stuff.  \n\n3) The music, daaaaaaamn I was blown away by it.\n\n4) Aproxemetly 100% more nep.  \n\n5) The new artstyle is good in places.  \n\nThe mediocre.\n\n1) Random encounters on the world map.  I see what they were trying to do with that but, all it adds is some pointless busywork.  It turns the map from a fun and sylish ui to a utter bore i dont want to look at.  The ammount of times ive been stopped going from dungeon to dungeon by a low level grunt is infuriating, it wouldnt be that bad if there wasnt a large load time at the end of it. \n\n2) Compaired to rebirth 2's port its not that bad.  Unless your unlucky.  \n\n3) The investment system, sounds cool in concept but it just adds more grinding for gold.\n\nThe bad.\n\n1)  The voice acting.  Compaired to the previous games, the english voices can range from good, mediocre and god damn cringeworthy.  \n\n2) The story.    It is awful.  It feels less like a parody of the video game industry and more like a really Really bad anime.  There are some good parts but.... the cringe factor is real. \n\n3) The banter,  the main reason why im playing this.  While some of it was good and I got the occasional chuckle from it.  It just sorta feels flat and lifeless (a bit like blancs...... oh you know where im going with that).  But yeah, I hate to say it but the charm of the previous games just isnt there for me.   (although I havent finished the game yet it might be better later on)\n\n4) The new art.  Some of it is good, just different.  But seriously some of it looks like it could have been done in ms paint.  I know they were trying to let us know that yes, these characters arent important.  But it was just ... jarring.\n\nAll in all I hate to say it, but I cant really recomend this to any new comers to the series.  I got some enjoyment from it myself but ... i cant really recomend it if your not a fan already.", "timestamp_created": 1469220876, "timestamp_updated": 1469221016, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499094", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24465300": {"recommendationid": "24465300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001221086", "num_games_owned": 2084, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 4391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476328722}, "language": "english", "review": "For those of you completely new to the series and the world of Neptunia, it is a hybrid turn-based JRPG and Visual Novel-esque game. The story elements are told with a mixture of fully voice acted and dialogue on screen style text boxes. The majority of the time the characters in a scene appear as static images on the screen with facial expressions changing to suit the mood of the character. There are a few full-motion videos mixed in, but they are not common.\n\nIn Megadimension Neptunia VII if you just quest run on the fairly linear track, you will actually miss quite a bit of the game. The scout system is back again, which unlocks new optional dungeons for you to explore as well as give you random items and credits. To give you encouragement and reasons to explore, the Guild system will issue you mostly optional quests. These quests help you in attaining credits, items and also increase your shares (power) for a faction. You can also invest in your home cities as well. Spending your hard earned credits to upgrade the city will cause new items to be sold in stores, give you more patterns to develop better gear, or raise your shares. You can also custom design your own power-ups too by fabricating discs with up to three different elements. Hidden treasures are available as well which act like challenges. There are even collectables available for you to try your luck with. I can tell you, Super Rare collectables really are super rare!\n\nThe gameplay involves a team of up to four (optionally supported with an additional team of up to four waiting on the sidelines) doing quests as they explore the area they are in. When in a dungeon, you can see the monsters/enemies roaming around which gives you the option to either fight them or try to sneak past them. In combat, the turns are displayed of the screen to give you an idea of who will be coming up next and if the next move is yours or the enemies. On your turn you can wander around within your movement range and then attack anything that falls inside your rotatable hitbox. You string together combos until the enemy is dead. Combos are set outside of battle and what combos will be available are determined by your character\u2019s level and what weapon they have equipped at the time. Careful crafting of combos outside of battle allows you to make most of your attacks critical hits rather than regular hits. As an alternative to just attacking the enemy you can also spend Skill Points to cast magic/abilities. These high powered abilities can buff you, debuff/status effect the enemy, heal you, or do higher damage to the enemy. Additionally, the EXE gauge will fill as you take damage or you attack (especially if you use Rush combos). EXE lets you do a few things. You can cast an even more powerful attack as the most basic option. You can have your characters team up in a formation attack where they all interact and take turns attacking the enemy (all while counting as only one move). You can also have your character team up with the character supporting them in the reserves to do a coupling attack. Using EXE also lets you super charge some of your characters allowing them to take on a much more powerful form. For the Gold Third characters, you can enter their Gold Power mode, for the CPUs, you can go to their Next Gen form, which is a transformation for their transformation! The main CPUs and CPU Candidates also have abilities which are affected by the number of shares you currently have as well, so having high shares means the attack is more effective.\n\nBesides the Next Gen Form and Golden Powers, there are a few new features added to this game that were not present in the previous entries. There is now a timer element and instant death mechanic in play while visiting a Neplunker dungeon. Instead of being safe when standing on a precipice, one wrong move will get you killed. Also coming in contact with most things will also kill you.. Making it to the end will get you a powerful reward making the effort worth it. Another new feature is the pocket dimension that is sometimes used. Uzume can use her special power to create a Sharing Field. Inside the Sharing Field you can battle giant enemies. You don\u2019t have access to your melee ranged attacks or abilities, but you do have a trickle of SP regeneration while in the field. Hoping from platform to platform allows you to spread your team out in order to more easily trigger formation attacks as well as make it harder to be wiped out. It also makes it harder to revive your fallen companions so you really need to figure out what strategy will work best for you.\n\nCharacter customization has always been a strong point in the Neptunia series. New weapons actually look different, often extremely different than the weapon the character was previously equipped with. While armor isn\u2019t really noticeable outside of CPU form, clothing can be changed to suit your tastes. Most of the clothing involves cosmetic changes only, but some of them actually will increase your stats a little as well. \n\nI never like spoiling a story for a game, but I do have to talk about the story a little here. The reason why this game is called Megadimension and not just Hyperdimension like its predecessors is the fact the game spans three separate dimensions. The first act serves as an excellent introduction to the gameplay and shows off all the basic mechanics for the game. The second act gives you a \u201cChoose your Own Adventure\u201d style choice system. You can basically pick which of the four stories you want to play first, second, third and last. All the stories take place at roughly the same time so there is some information bleed over that occurs between them which some might consider spoiling events of that other yet to be played option. It makes it a nice touch because it keeps the worlds from seeming completely isolated from each other while at the same time allows the game to play out four whole story arcs simultaneously. The final act of the trilogy ties together the first two acts and carries you on to one of the three endings. \n\nThere are a few common elements shared between all the Hyperdimension games. Other than the characters, the enemies carry over as well. It makes perfect sense that the same enemies will be battled in each of the games as they are all set in the same location, the Hyper dimension. New enemies naturally pop up in each new installment of the game, but the familiar ones are very welcome as well including the series long running villain Arfoire. The enemies are all voiced in Megadimension Neptunia VII as well, and their dialogue changes based on how well they are doing in battle. Another element that is shared between the games are the dungeon layouts. While this makes sense, again same dimension, it is a little unfortunate that the exact same layouts of dungeons are reused so often between games and within the game itself.\n\nSo should you get it? If you are fan of the Hyperdimension main series, you would be doing yourself a disservice by not picking it up. It is the fourth game in the main series after all. The gameplay is basically similar to its predecessors, at least the Re;Birth incarnations, but it has a whole new story with new and returning familiar characters. If you are new to the series, you might want to start with Re;Birth2 (story arc start) or at least Re;Birth3 so you will be able to get the references back to the previous games.

rebirth 2 and 3 \n\nand maybe rebirth 1 if you really want to get into the series but rebirth 1 takes place in Super dimension instead of Hyper dimension so there is alot of differences in the series but don't be swayed by the all consuming confusion. the game takes place in the game platform universe being Sega is Planeitune, Lastation which is playstation, Loweii which is Wii, and Leanbox, which is as you would guess Xbox the series is based off of the 4 goddess that watch over Gameindustri ill try not to spoil but they protect there citizens from harm while trying to boost there shares which is gained by the trust of there people which in turn gives them power to protect them.\n\neach game has a different but connected story i would reccomend this game to anyone who is a avid fan of the series at current price just because of the shear amazment that you will get from it the combat system reworked the story always somthing new and alot of plot twists and a few you would of never guessed \n\nthis isn't a game for casuals the bosses are Really really hard and you can get your ass handed to ya if you don't grind \n\nall and all the game runs smooth havn't noticed any bugs battles are difficult but managable it's really how much effort you put into it if you go half ass your gonna get a half ass results\n\nif your a newby i suggest an earlier game just to understand the series but if your gung ho for it it won't matter much just refer to wiki for all your answers\n", "timestamp_created": 1469133750, "timestamp_updated": 1469133750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

That's not necessarily a bad thing.\nIt took a minute for me to get used to it after having played the rest of the games for so long, but it has a lot of charm too.\n\nSeems to be a fairly good port, I don't know why I've heard people complaining about it.  It's running at 60 FPS on my 1920x1080 laptop without any problems.  Controller works fine, and it plays just as well as every other game in the franchise.\n\nGuess I'll get into a list of pros and cons, assuming there are any of the latter.\n\nPros\n\n-More Nep.  Two Neps, actually.   Which is good; we can always use more Neps.\n-Pretty graphics and smooth gameplay\n-Lots to do.   Plenty of replay value, just like every Nep game.\n-Practically naked ladies in the first hour of gameplay\n-In-depth combo creation with special set-ups.\n\nCons\n\n-It's a little different from Hyperdimension's games, so if you're used to that it'll take a bit to get used to.\n\nThat's about it.   The price is a liiiiittle steep, I got it when it was on the 40% off sale, but still -- you're not losing anything if you buy it at full price, you'll have just as much fun.  \n\nAlso, most of the DLC's are clothes and such, but they're nice to have anyway, because everybody needs more swimsuit Neps in their life, right?\n\n\nYes.\n\nAlso, pudding.", "timestamp_created": 1469121151,

If you have not played the game, worry not - this review is [i]spoiler free[/i].\n\n[h1]General Overview[/h1]\nFirst off, I originally played Re;Birth 1 and 3 and enjoyed both of them. With comparisons to the previous title and I'm sure you would have known by now that this game is a huge step up from the previous titles, in terms of Story, Soundtracks, Battle system and nonetheless the overall gameplay.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the new Route-building mechanic and the fact that you actually have to \"walk\" in order to get from one end of the map to the other. Health/SP will not regen upon coming out of a dungeon like the previous titles (which could be exploited rather easily to grind) which is another good improvement. This adds a new layer of difficulty to the game on top of the battle systems that was revised to be more strategic based. \n\n[h1]Content and Story progression[/h1]\nIn previous games, I personally find that they are filled with a lot of filler content, with a great amount of side characters and their events in which you have to watch even if you aren't interested - else the prompt never goes away. However, the events of this game are largely pointing towards the progression of the story, of which each event never fails the captivate and maintain the hype and excitement the player would have for the game's story, very little fillers and simply with that I feel that my time spent here is entertaining all the time.\n\nOh and another thing, I actually have not attained multiple endings for Re;birth 1 and 3 despite enjoying the game as I no longer felt motivated to replay to obtain a certain ending. [b]However[/b] for VII, I only obtained the Normal End as mentioned earlier and feel unusually determined to replay and see the True ending - which I will proceed to do it now, the fact that even after completion I still feel the hype and excitement truly indicates an amazing Story.\n\n[h1]Some Downsides[/h1]\n- Controller Default controls are rather broken simply due to the mismap of the Right Trigger, which can be fixed by remapping it to the default control map.\n\n-Some sound stuttering at times but does not affect gameplay much.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nI rate this game 9.5/10.

Really great voices.\nGraphics: Improved, 3D not spectacular but 2D arts are great. Smooth on my system but check Requirements.\nGameplay: Improved. Some new changes, Strategy mitigates grinding, can get repetitive outside of boss battles once you have good tactics. But one of the best JRPGs gameplay recently.\n\nOverall: This game manages to capture my heart even when I'm not into RPGs.\n\n[b]Recommended For: Story, Characters and Sounds.[/b]\nAny question or something I missed in the details? Tell me in the comments!\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThis is what I bought the game for, and it didn't fail me.\n(No Spoiler)\nThe game takes place after Neptunia Victory (Re;birth3). It is unclear how much time had passed.\n\nThere are [b]Three[/b] stories in the game.\nZero Dimension: A tattered dimension where a lone CPU is fighting against a mysterious enemy.\nHyperdimension G: The CPUs have to survive a period called CPU Shift.\nHeartDimension: The Finale of the Trilogy.\nThe themes of Megadimension are: Dreams, Wishes and Determination.\n\nI have gotten both Endings of this game and both have greatly touched me.\n\nThe story is usually portrayed with its unique comedy style. When the story gets serious, it wovens into the comedic style extremely well and the characters' actions all fit their personalities. \nThe story has many touching moments, truly showing the best of the characters. Megadimension's Story is the best of the series so far and it had made me feel like tears could come at times, with all its threads well-connected.\n\nAnd Fanservice, The series had been very aware of this and frequently joke about it. The moments don't feel forced, they have always been focused on comedy, if you don't dismiss them, you'll the writers' good sense of humour and clever writings.\n\n[b]Is this for you?[/b] If you like a Cheerful, Comedic and Clever story that can also be Serious when it wants to, Yes. This is a lovable world with its own sets of rules, so take that into consideration. This isn't a simple story, the writers had given its depth that I don't often see. (Considering the dozens of thousands lines of text, this shouldn't surprise you)\n\n[h1]Characters[/h1]\nMy favourite characters in the series: Everyone.\n\nAside for some rare exceptions, all characters are all lovable and well written. They all look  cliche at first, but like in real life, you shouldn't judge them by first impressions, after all at first sight we're all walking stereotypes until we know each other more. Each character has their own unique personality with more depths once you get to know them. \nNeptune, our protagonist of protagonists, is always cheerful and happy-go-lucky, afraid of works but she had shown times and times again that she cares deeply for everyone and when pushes come to shove, she is ready to do anything necessary to help her friends and Gamindustri, even if it means [spoiler]sacrificing herself[/spoiler] in Re;birth2's [spoiler]Conquest Ending[/spoiler].\n\nThe characters' designs have been based on their real-world counterparts mixed in with some fictional quirks.\nSuch as the new character Uzume is based on a certain console, her character and story have ties to the real-world events.\n\n[b]Is this for you?[/b] If you like a colourful cast, this is for you. If you're not fond of archetypes, then if you can look into the characters, you may find the depths which you seek. \n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nIt has some of the best music in games I have heard in a long while. There are many new tracks, many of which are composed fitting for certain situations. There are a few that feel like just \"filler music\", however many stand out.\n\nThis game's Soundtrack tops all previous games' for sure. If you have similar taste in music as I do, Over 100 hours put in the game and I haven't got tired of my favourite tracks yet (although I tuned out the more generic ones).\n\nThe Voices (I played in Japanese Voice) are superb, you can feel the characters' emotions through the voices alone.\n\n[b]Is this for you?[/b] I can't really say, this depends on your taste. But for me, it had been very nice.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nIt is not the best looking game nor the most optimised game, the performance fortunately is fine within the requirements. It's a shame because if the game was better optimised, it surely would attract more buyers.\nThe game looks much better than its predecessors, perhaps it is the benefits of  being a PS4 port (Re;birth games are from Vita)\nThe Models, Visual Effects and Animations have all received improvements. Animations in particular are very \"stylised\".\n\nThe 2D Scenes have very well drawn sprites and portraits, the characters all appear in high details with different expressions. All 2D arts are new in this game and I say enough on their quality.\n\nThere are many new types of dungeons and their variations. The level designs are larger than before and at some dungeons, sometimes outright mazes. Sometimes variations aren't that different, however.\n\n[b]In short:[/b] It's not a graphic powerhouse, but you can see its styles. While the 3D visually is not spectacular, the animations and 2D arts are great, in my opinion.\n\n[b]Is this for you?[/b] If you like Anime styles then this would fit you. Check the System Requirements, though, that's a definite drawbacks.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nA mix of Turn Based Traditional RPG and Action. Characters have free movements, a set of skills and moves to use.\n\nA new feature is Combo Trait. It forces you not to put into your Combo not the strongest moves, but choose moves that can fulfil the Combo Trait requirements to get Guaranteed Critical Hits.\nOne change is to Formation Skills, 2-4 characters now have to position themselves around the targets to use.\nThere are also more Moves for all returning characters along with new animations.\n\nSome new things for enemies. They would surround you, avoid grouping together. Some enemies have damage-reducing \"Parts\", you must attack from the right direction to break them.\n\nYou may also have notice the nice new [spoiler]NEXT[/spoiler] Form. Activation requires an EXE Bar and have some advantages.\n\n[b]Grindy?[/b] When it comes to JRPGs, many expects Grind. However, to me this is not grindy if you play with tactics. For example, when I battled a major boss of the game, I failed first, but returning with more thoughts, I won.\n\n[b]How I played:[/b] No DLC Weapons or Characters. I didn't go for extra grinding and only get into a dungeon when the story requires me to on first playthrough, and kill all monsters insight.\n\n[b]In short:[/b] The game has some nice new mechanics which lets you to use tactics to overwise \"button mashy\" battles, allowing you to minimise grinding.\n\nRecommendation: Some are Glass Cannons, AOE and Formation Skills are your best friends (situational), use (de)buffs.\n\n[b]Is this for you?[/b] In my opinion, it's not bad but not perfect, battles often feel best when the story preceding it builds the tension for the battle. It can be challenging at first but once you have a plan, normal enemies are quite simple and can get a bit repetitive. Sometimes the game would put you in a difficult situation to make it interesting, you would need to think about managing your items and characters else you risk a Game Over.\n\nTo be fair, this is the case for many RPGs I know and MegaNep is one of the best I know of.

I didn't expect me to do this.\n\nI bought the game during the reduced week. I got the digital deluxe edition so I've got access to all DLCs and I got a digital artbook and the soundtrack. I mostly buy Neptunia games to support the franchise. I like the stories they tell, the characters are quirky and adorable. And I love to see many Japanese franchises coming to the West as I consider myself a J-Gamer. Now why do I write a review of THIS game and now the Re;birth parts - or Neptunia U.\n\nWell, to be frank: because this game touched me at a very personal level.\n\nSo let's try to start with the technical parts:\nTechnologically speaking the game is like the Re;births just sub par. It has seemingly high system requirements and it basically delivers graphics which are not on par with modern games. It is without any doubt the best looking title of the Neptunia franchise but seeing how the Re;birth parts and Neptunia U and such are essentially Vita ports you'd expect that. Still it has a graphical performance which even early PS3 titles would beat - and maybe even PS2 titles (except for their lower resolution obviously).\nSame can be said for the rest: the battling system is solid for JRPGs, you cannot however have very complex influence about your character development. You level up.. you change equipment. You adjust combos - and you develop items which give you some boost in some directions. That's solid! But not super outstanding. A few positive changes however include:\n[list][*]the foes this time act far more strategically so consider who you send against them and how you position your team\n[*]formations are far more complex\n[*]you don't just smash your enemy to break their defense. You work around it\n[*]A new form even stronger than the CPU form[/list]\n\nSo well.. all in all: very solid, graphically weak - but let's be honest. You don't play this game if you search for in-depth RPG game play. Do you play it because Vert has huge boobs? Or that Blanc doesn't have any at all. Maybe! In general: all the characters are as stereotypical as you expect in Neptunia - you have your Tsundere, you have your polar opposite twins and so on. Then you put a little more depth than just the stereotypical hull and that's it. It's the little depthes some characters have which make them quite lovable to me.\n\nBut then: especially our big new character Uzume who joins this game. She has far deeper than the others and in my honest opinion a very lovable character after some playtime and grasping the story.\n\nAnd that's it: the story of this game in my opinion is just great. Not only does this game give you a very lengthy story line which stretches across 3 major stories and thus giving you several hours of game time. And even more importantly: forget about the RPG part.. forget about the simple graphics. But read the story in all its glory. The story is very touching, very deep and while it's very lengthy it doesn't feel stretched. At the end I felt like all of those details were necessary - where I sometimes thought \"Okay, that's cute but what does it mean.\" The end tied up everything perfectly.\n\nIn addition: the music - while often still being very generic and sometimes literally plain unfitting - at some places to me shows true glory this time. Originally I only bought the digital deluxe edition to convince Idea Factory to release more stuff in the West - now I catch myself listening to many of the tracks the game has to offer.\n\nWorth it: very much so! Would nep again! New game plus - I'm coming. I'll just wait 3 more days.", "timestamp_created": 1468847929, "timestamp_updated": 1468847929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551648", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24389681": {"recommendationid": "24389681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042685309", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 27473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470268940}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Nep game out there. \n\nA ton of new unique characters! Really hard to decide which ones to use in the front and backline, since they're all so interesting and different too in terms of abilities. \n\nGraphics, combat and different mechanics have greatly improved as well. The game looks great in 1080p, also has AA and PP effects added, and you can change them in the options now. Combat requires more thinking and positioning compared to the previous games. \nThe AI is also more smart, always flanking and trying to get the AoE attacks if your party members are too close to each other.\n\nMusic-wise the game is really good, has a lot of new OSTs and more openings/endings than ever.\nThe game has 3 chapters, so there's a lot of content in terms of story.

It's a bigger problem because the difficulty in this fluctuates a lot from easy to tough to easy and so on, at least if you're not overleveled and/or you don't have any of the combat-helpful DLC turned on.\n\nGraphically it's hardly any better from the rest of the games. There's some DOF that you can toggle and bloom that you can't. All that may as well just be unnecessary sprinkles on ice cream because while the textures haven't at least downgraded they haven't really gotten much better if at all.\nSome textures are apparently missing including one from an attack, an outfit, and an enemy or two. I think one enemy's supposed to be invisible but the other I've searched up and there's apparently an image from the PS4 version of what it's supposed to look like. There's also a few stuttering issues when sifting through interface stuff like attack menus and even during cutscenes.\n\nThe story's now separated into different story arcs as opposed to chapters but they essentially still act like chapters. One story arc though focuses on four routes for the four CPUs where each route has the designated CPU be the protagonist for the selected path. You're free to choose which CPU's route to go through until there's one left and afterwards the game resumes as normal.\nBecause of the plot, your inventory prior to the 4-route thing will all go to Neptune meaning everyone BUT Neptune will start their route off with essentially nothing.\n\nCompared to the Re;birth series currently on Steam there's a serious lack of character count, even with the new story ones and the DLC. There also aren't many magic users now because of this.[/strike] [u][b]Also, there's no Pururut here.[/b][/u]\n\n[strike]The game's been adjusted so item-usage is practically essential and careful planning for fights is more encouraged. You no longer restore your HP & SP when you level up either.\nThere's some bonus damage now in attacking an enemy from the back and side though it's sometimes hard to tell where the side, back, and/or front is on some enemies.\nSome enemies have pieces of them that you can break that can only be destroyed when attacked enough in their direction. They're damaged along with the enemy and they've got their own damage number display when hit.\n\nThe turn-based fights are mostly the same with the moving characters around per turn and such. They've removed the shield HP thing entirely so the only kind of real defense there'd usually be to worry about are the breakable parts that give an enemy an advantage if they're not destroyed. \nAttack combos have been changed enough so you don't just rely on choosing the attack with the highest listed numbers. Categories are once again Rush, Power, and, this time now, Standard. Standard attacks are naturally pointless aside from taking advantage of some of the Standard attacks with elemental properties and the now included combo traits. \nCombo traits give big bonus damage when their listed conditions are met. Examples of that are things like \"All previous attacks were Power\" or \"Previous attack was Standard\". It's very worthwhile and almost mandatory in some parts to take advantage of those bonus traits so actual planning is encouraged.\n\nLily ranks are here as usual only now each person's rank no longer increases from being coupled but rather when they're on the front lines instead. Coupling still gives off the usual bonus stats depending on how high the Lily rank is with the couple. Supportive things like healing one another and using multi-person skills also help with Lily rank raising.\n\nThe overworld now functions on a boardgame-esque way as in you have to constantly build dotted routes to designated locations to be able to travel to them in order to progress the story further since you can't just hover over a cursor and instantly go where you need to go to anymore. Sometimes & annoyingly you'll get the typical JRPG wild encounter when traversing through the overworld. It's more annoying because the wild encounters on the overworld are generally weak and worthless in rewards. Only on NG+ are you allowed the option of turning that off completely.\nWhen you start building routes in the usual map with the 4 nations and such, they don't all connect. For whatever reason they decided that Lowee be a destination that's all the way at the end of a road, even near the end of the game. So if you were in Planeptune and wanted to go to the Lowee region you have to run in almost a circle to get there as opposed to something closer to a straight line.\nThere aren't as many dungeons and enemy variations here though they're still reskinned to hell.\n\nThey decided to not include Stella's Dungeon here and instead use a Scout system where you can simultaneously send NPCs to dungeons so they can find money, hidden treasure hints, monster loot, new scouts, and new dungeons after around 10 minutes of their scouting. Scouts have various bonus effects and disadvantages towards you if you enter a dungeon where a Scout's currently at, like \"EXP Up +10%\" or \"Credits Down -5%\". For whatever reason they decided to not make the timer countdown in real-time like Stella's Dungeon did. When I go to another window the entire game pauses as well as the timer. Scouts only go back to searching in their selected dungeon if you grab their rewards.\nMid to late game there will be a couple more dungeon-riddled dimensions for Scouts to be able to go through. Unfortunately you can only send them to those dungeons and get their rewards when you yourself are in the same dimension so everytime you want to send someone or pick up your reward you have to walk on the overworld all the way to the desired dimension to do all that. Far more annoying with the wild encounters.\n\nWhen starting New Game + you're allowed to carry over almost everything as well as the characters themselves who will be available for use right from the beginning. Apparently things like the hidden dungeons & hidden treasures found by the Scouts don't carry over. If you've found those dungeons & treasures on the first playthrough you'll have to use the Scouts to find the dungeons & treasures again on NG+.\n\nJust like the previous games the translator(s) decided to put more of their own silly jokes in a lot of places to \"better pander to the Western audience\" instead of translating it completely, as in if you can understand even a lick of Japanese you'll notice much of the audio is absolutely different from some of the English text. Some of the translation even decides to extend text for their own jokes when the JP audio is that much shorter. On top of all that the text frequently has spelling, grammatical, & punctual errors.\nClearly I dislike the dub but even if you preferred the dub, some areas are apparently missing EN audio. It shows too in the game files that the EN audio's file size is tinier than the JP audio it contains.[/strike]\n\n[h1][b]In conclusion, this review does not and will not matter because

The Story is divided by 3 Arc; Z, G, and H. The First Arc is given Post-Apocalypse Atmosphere and that kinda cool and fresh material in Neptunia Series. And the True End (Revival Ending) is the best True End ever! \n+ BGs are now animated? Cool.\n+ New Character Design, especially Noire's and Blanc's new design are better than before~\n+ Transforming Scene? Next Form? New Skills? New Dungeons? Hell Yeah!\n+ I see now IF become realistic, like, have to actually walk if we want to go to other place (Hopefully Open World soon), and share decreases if the CPUs Transforming or knocked out. It's cool, but it kinda irritated me sometime\n+ The BGMs are frickin cool! Bought Deluxe Set so you can listen to it outside the game really worth it\n+ And sometime this game is kinda dark, kinda cool but still creepy\n+ Noire being teased never failed to amuse me\n+ Yuri instensifies\nCons ;\n- People said it ported pretty badly, well I played this game smoothly, but It still kinda lag sometime even though I met the Reccomended Spec alr\n- Neplunker Zero : Cancer Edition\n- SP Skills and EXE Drives are too weak. Seriously, even 4 normal attack is stronger than 4 person formation EXE Drive \n- Addicting, just like drugs, when I'm outside, all I can think is \"MEGADIMENSIONMEGADIMENSIONMEGADIMENSION\" Oh God make it stop\n\nSo yeah, that basically it. I can't really think the Cons part since I really enjoy this game, lol. Sorry for my bad english~ Will patiently wait for the next IF's Walletcrusher Nep!\n\nAnd K-Sha?

Got consistent frame drops (down to ~20fps for a second or two) with an i5-6600K and GTX 970.\n- The Neplunker levels can get fairly annoying since the game isn't really built around platforming\n- Getting the hidden treasures in Senmuu Labyrinth made me want to kill myself\n- Not enough Uzume being cute (THIS IS IMPORTANT)\n\nOverall, this game was more fun than any of the previous games in the series that I've played. This game also serves as a good entry point to the series (better if you've played Victory/Rebirth 3) as they explain enough of the backstory for someone entering cold to understand the setting.\n\nSide note: While I bought the DLC, I'd say it was only really useful during the middle part of the game, but at the same time removed a lot of the challenge (so I played that part mostly without).

Outside of small freezes/pauses occasionally when loading dialog, and frame drops on certain parts of maps, this was the best Neptunia port I've played.\n\nI think the first part of the game's \"trilogy\" was the best Neptunia experience I've had. I've always been annoyed at the fact that Neptunia games tend to reuse a LOT of old content, to the point where sometimes playing new versions of the game felt like you were playing the same game as before. In the first part, \"Zero Dimension,\" you were put in a different world with new maps and much nicer looking enviornments, characters, and mobs. In addition, the character sprites were updated for everyone and they look pretty good. Zero Dimension had small events between main story events where characters you knew interacted with newer characters and the new world around them, and felt very refreshing. There was actually some difficulty as well at the first part (for a Neptunia game) that made the combat system feel enjoyable. The second part feels very SLOW (especially if you don't particularly like certain CPUs), and the third part feels really short and really lacking. The story's quality degrades and the gameplay transforms into spamming skills on bosses to win.\nOld maps start coming back which REALLY contrast with the visually updated characters and mobs, and it doesn't help that they often have lower frames than the shinier new maps somehow.\n\nOverall, the game had some interesting new features and changes, although not all were very good. Instead of the old \"select a location to go from the map\" style, you now have a route system where you must build routes with credits to dungeons found either by \"scouts\" (similar to victory's Stella's dungeon) or found through the story events. This sounds cool and kinda is, but can be VERY annoying with long paths because of random fights with low level mobs that feel like a complete waste of time. There is also Parts Break, which was cool for one fight only in the main story but overall felt very pointless and was underutilized. The combat system was changed so that there were no guards, and instead all the different 3 attacks could \"combo,\" which was more interesting than spamming X until guards broke then spamming something else. Investing was cool but felt really lacking, and quests were lessened but lengthened so that you could easily have a quest that required you to kill the same mob 8-10 times.\n\nI think the game was a fairly good port overall, and the changes were mostly positive. I think that the great experience of the first part really makes up for the latter two parts enough for the game to be considered good.", "timestamp_created": 1468638868, "timestamp_updated":

game that intrested me this much with the music, gameplay, fighting mechanics and other stuff, as a new-comer to the series I dont know if this was the best one to go with, even though it doesnt seem like you needed to play the last few games to get what is going on and the relativly new things are explained by the constantly 4th wall breaking band of CPUS as they go into dungeons, other dimentions and in my case, take no damage, never die and dish out such a devestating combo that it makes nuclear bombs jealous.\n\nIf your thinking of getting this and your a new-comer like me, get a controller, this game is horrible to play on keyboard + mouse, the steam controller works fine but the XBOX controllers are favored.\n\nSince the steam discussions are branching off the see which character is best, Id say there is abit too much fan service, your got Vert but thats expected, Nepgear from what I could tell a fairly innocent character gets abit flirty at some points with Uni, if I was pressed to say a favorite character I'd say Noire\n\nAfter hitting the finishing line at about 38 hours, the game threw balance out of the window with such force that it resembled a speeding car, the good ending is, good, but the true ending is the the thing you actually need to put some time into, level 999 is abit too much even for mebut ill probably do it since I still like the gameplay as much as when I orginally sat down to play it\n\n9/10, Good game, love it\n\n----------AFTER TRUE ENDING----------\nENDING SPOILER WARNING SPOILER WARNING HOOT HOOT PUT IT ON MUTE!!!\n\n[spoiler]Wow, to be honest I absolutely LOVED the ending, not only do the CPUs and other characters congratulate you for playing it to the very end, they also give out fanservice, and as a newcomer I laughed for a good 5 minutes, Vert obviously is the first to say \"its called fanservice\" and Uni even 'notices' the player and says: \"Hey why are looking at me down there, of course I

Was expecting more parodies, jokes, light hearted harassment towards Lastation's CPU, Leanbox trying to obtain a successor by hook or by crook and the two Neptunes up to no good. Finally finished the game and I got more than I bargained for. I wasn't expecting feels from a game like this, but she \"waking up from the dream\" (figuratively and literally) pulled my heartstrings.\nThe Gold Third didn't leave as much as an impression on me, unlike that fluffy headed CPU.\nThe normal ending left me with a feeling that I should try harder on my next playthrough but I should take a 2 weeks break first.

So far the stories for each of the Neptunia series has not disappointed me. All of this series always makes me constantly asking myself  'what's going to happen next?' Neptunia VII is no exception. With this drive, I always end up spending lots of time playing it, even if you feel bored grinding, the story always finds its ways to cheer you up with hilarious conversations that will make you grin like a r*tard. However I have to say that this has by far one of the most engaging story so far coupled with some tearjerking moments. Steam already handled the summary so I will not touch on it in my review.\n\n[b] -Game Mechanics- 10/10 [/b]\nThe Neptunia Series is probably 1 of my most favourite JRPGs ever since its first release on PS3. From spamming SP skills to Rush combos -> EXE skills, the evolution of this game's mechanics has come a long way and MDNVII has by far the best game mechanics compared to the prequels. Compile heart and Idea Factory really nailed this one perfectly. Strategic planning of your own combos to activate bonuses for critical damage as well as some special skills that you can use at your own discretion if you want to end a battle with style. Unlike the previous series where spamming skills is the best way to deal damage, this time its all about setting up the perfect combos.  \n\n[b] -Characters / Artwork - 9/10 [/b]\nI took interest in the neptunia series when I saw the 1st game's PS3 Boxart for the first time on the shelves of my local retail store. The beautifully created characters along with each of their unique personalities has kept me hooked onto the screen everytime a conversation or dialogue is being played. All the characters in this series has never triggered my disdain even the main villians in the series always has a certain charmpoint/funny aspect about them that makes you laugh and grin everytime you see them.  Characters aside, the background artwork is always wonderfully drawn in tandem with the characters. However minus 1 from verdict points as some background are just reused from the prequels with HD Textures. Addin on, some endgame dungeons are are really annoying with no textures, like you're in some retro game and those dungeons really takes a toll on your eyes but nevertherless its not a big deal since its only like 4 or 5 dungeons.\n\n[b] -Audio/bgm/voice- 10/10 [/b]\n\nThe music/bgm in this game is perfectly done for every situation and it always fits the situation you are in. Be it a dungeon, when you're transforming to HDD Form, climax sections, when you're unleashing an ultimate skill, et cetra. The audio team really composed the BGMs to fit perfectly in any situations. So far none of the bgms has made me annoyed before. As for the Voice of the characters, NIS always provided English and Japanese Voices so its a personal preference. I prefer the Japanese Voices as it feels more natural and there is more emotions involved in the speech patterns. Japanese Voice acting has always been Top Notch.\n\n[b] -Difficulty- 10/10  [/b]\n\nThis series has never offered any difficulty settings and the difficulty is based on your equipment and level. The difficulty of this game is really flexible as you can choose to purchase DLCs to make the game easy for those that are interested in the story only or simply don't have the time to grind your levels or else, you can play the game normally and you will encounter certain parts that will prove to be a challenge unless you grind your levels.\n\nKudos to NIS for translating the game ever since the start of this series as well as Idea Factory and Compile Heart for making such a wonderful series.", "timestamp_created": 1468485109, "timestamp_updated": 1468486384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587371", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24310306": {"recommendationid": "24310306", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100208924", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486537565}, "language": "english", "review": "Think I found my own meaning of life\nMore Waifu = More Laifu\n\n[spoiler] C-Sha Master Race\t[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1468482036, "timestamp_updated": 1468482036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24309657": {"recommendationid": "24309657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026458662", "num_games_owned": 1461, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477811094}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Nep to Date!!\nNep/10", "timestamp_created": 1468477954, "timestamp_updated": 1511420605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527473", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24309621": {"recommendationid": "24309621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045882910", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1514005051}, "language": "english", "review": "Nepgear is best gear 10/10 Top Nep <3\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CSHKlMIWcAAl9p3.jpg", "timestamp_created": 1468477730, "timestamp_updated": 1468477730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24308775": {"recommendationid": "24308775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119814464", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504132758}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Desde que conoci el Re;birth 1 , ame esta serie sean en sus sagas y en su anime , fiel fan de neptune siguire teniendo toda su coleccion cueste lo que cueste , la trama de esta saga me cautivo mucho ...

The grind was also lessened considerably, as merely exploring dungeons for items is enough to level in times of need. \n\nRegarding the dungeons, they are now much more interesting to explore, since they're much larger and more varied, some with areas only accessible later in the game, which can give you great rewards for exploring.\n \nThe soundtrack was improved DRASTICALLY with entirely new tracks, adding an intensity to the battles/scenes the past games sometimes couldn't provide.\n\nThe story was quite a nice surprise, with way more character development than the previous titles, a much larger cast of important characters, the absolute best antagonist in the entire series, three different endings and even some routed scenarios! (By the way, one of those endings *might* make you cry, just letting you know) \n\nRepetitive jokes such as Vert mentioning Blanc's bust size are a rare sighting now, that might be a positive or a negative point depending on the person. (I was getting tired of those, though) \n\nTwice as much Nep with four times more intensity. I can't see that as a negative point for anyone.\n\nAlso, Uzume. That's a big positive. \n\nNEXT Forms and NEXT Drives for increased flashiness and damage in battle\n\nMemes, a lot of them. You decide whether that's good or not. \n\nThe Scout and Crafting Systems are completely optional and won't interfere in your playthrough unless you want them to\n\nNow, for the actual negatives. \n\nI would say some dungeons are bothersome to explore due to their uncomfortably large proportions and amount of rooms, making it easy to get lost. \n\nThe combat systems, although a lot more diversified, might still be a bore for some, but it's definitely better than its predecessors, and assuming everyone reading is familiar with JRPGs and/or the Neptunia series, this point might seem unnecessary. \n\nA relevant amount of players are experiencing gamebreaking glitches related to their graphic cards, so there's this risk. I expect a patch to be released soon, since there've been quite a few complaints.\n\nOverall it's a very solid title for newcomers to the series and even more so to veterans.

And believe me, it's an overhaul alright. The graphics are nicer, the level design is fucking brilliant compared to the Re;Birth trilogy (which is what I'm comparing it to), and the main characters are even more fleshed out than ever before, which I like. The soundtrack is nice as well; some of these tracks are actually pretty amazing.\n\nThat said, there is one major problem with this game. I... didn't have as much fun with it as I did with the Re;Birth series. I'll go through the major issues, which combined, make this game a bit lacklustre, at least to me.\n\n- The first is the difficulty. It fucking slides about like a wet turd on a teflon floor. The first two areas of the game are nice and easy, then the enemies suddenly gain stats that are about three times as high as the ones just before. This is a ridiculous difficulty spike and it really threw me off when I first got to that third area (and I've finished the entire Re;Birth trilogy so I should be pretty good). Unfortunately, this trend continues throughout the game. Some bosses are easy, some are challenging, but then others are downright cheating (I'm looking at you, K-Sha, you multi-turn, million shots per attack shithead). The difficulty of the game flipflops like crazy throughout the whole game and it's not really fun to work around.\n\n- The storyline is not nearly immersive or expansive enough for the story it's trying to tell. Two of the antagonists you see throughout the second part of the game, they're pretty big and important in that bit. Then at the beginning of the third chapter you just defeat them. That's it. THAT'S IT. THEY ARE SOME OF THE BEST AND MOST INTERESTING CHARACTERS AND YOU JUST... DEFEAT THEM. Yeah there's a bit of unnecessary bullshit with the whole 'NEXT' thing, but seriously? The way they portray the whole third chapter, it's like they were never threats at all. This is just one example. Blanc's route during the second chapter is 70% EXPOSITION. The remainder is just bosses and the worst areas in the entire game. There are so many issues with the story that it's barely even worth shitting on, and that's a shame, because it could have been REALLY good.\n\n- After literally more than a dozen games, some of which are spinoffs, you'd think, you'd just THINK, that they'd bother to put more effort into their cutscenes than they do. They're identical to the cutscenes from the old games, which I find is just plain laziness more than anything else. I don't quite understand why these games take over a dozen gigabytes when the cutscenes, which take up about a third of the game in total, are just slighty animated portraits with some facial movement... and text. Just text. Admittedly there is a higher percentage of voice-acting in this one, which is great because I love the voices of the characters. It's just that they're still recycling exactly the same style and sprites for these scenes without any innovation.\n\n- And the bosses. The fucking combat in general is a near-perfect carbon copy of any other Neptunia game, which is REALLY DISAPPOINTING. The only new mechaninc are the giant fights, of which I experienced two of them, and both of which were in the first chapter, and are never brought up again. BOOOOORIIIING. I want at least some innovation, please, is that too much to ask? But I digress. One new mechanic in the boss battles is the multiple health bars thing. BUT IT'S POINTLESS. They only exist to give a false sense of progression through a boss battle, and nothing EVER makes use of them. WHY HAVE THEM AT ALL? Some major bosses also have some quote they'll utter when they hit half health, but nothing else ever happens, so why bother? The difficulty problem also applies - some bosses are piss easy and do barely anything, while others FUCKING NUKE YOUR ASSES OFF THE PLANET. Why have bosses with nukes? That's just cheap. And don't even get me started on K-Sha.\n\nI got the bad ending on the first run, which is good, because if I get the bad one then I like that it's because I didn't fulfil the requirements for the good one. The problem with the  bad ending is that the already short story just... stops. Abruptly, and with the whole 'we're all going to die' vibe. That whole bad end just sums up the game really. It's just that in comparison to the Re;Birth games, this is just a bit on the disappointing side.\n\nThat all being said, I still had SOME fun with it, just not as much as the old games. I can still recommend it, especially if you've not played the Re;Birth trilogy, but if you want something better, just get those.", "timestamp_created": 1468420261, "timestamp_updated": 1472901154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24296272": {"recommendationid": "24296272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198292140408", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 35511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511410750}, "language": "english", "review": "the story....\nmore darker than before...\n\nbut still had a lots joke....\n\nno matter what, this is a good game i ever play....\nmy rate 10/10\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n..\nstill... in the end.... lots tears come out from my eyes...

Lots of nice pudding.\nMainly for gameplay, the battles feel much more engaging and the world feels tons more alive with the route system. The giant battles and the transformation sequences feel satisfying and make you feel powerful as well, which is a massive plus.\n\nI've been a fan of Neptunia since the release of Hyperdimension V and I thought the cast of V was it. It was their best moment and none of the side releases like U or Hyperdevotion Noire could amass to what they've accomplished. But Idea Factory and Compile Hearts delivers to impress on VII with an even BETTER cast and even more characters to love.\n\nWho ever thought that since on release, that the dodgy original Hyperdimension Neptunia series for the PS3 would spawn such a large fanbase with such a niche but smart target audience?\n\nI'm probably just fanwhoring at this point but I do support people buying this game and hope they can have the same enjoyment that I had with it.\nMaybe for context, you would want to buy Re;Birth 3 first, but as a standalone, VII can be lovable as well.\n\nNepNep/10",

Slowtown occurs when random battle happens at world screen. There's also memory leak management that needs to be improved.\n\nA controller is highly recommended if you want to play this game.

Note that this review is based on PS4 version and I believe that there are no differences between the PC version:\n\nPro\n----\n+ Uzume (no seriously - possibly no 1 reason). Her gap moe is something!!!\n+ Umio.\n+ Adult Neptune and Neptune combi!\n+ Megami 2nd form!!\n+ Scout system now easier to understand - unlike Victory.\n+ Brought back the original Neptunia features - Break obstacles!\n+ LARGER DUNGEON!!!\n+ EXE drive does not carry over to the next battle (yeah! more challenging!!). No more cheap EXE spam!\n+ Enemies has breakable parts! (Now positioning characters makes more sense!).\n+ One of the few games that I need to utilise buff skill!!!!! (Kudos, challenge 5 star).\n+ G dimension lets you fully utilise each megami individually! No more picking fav yo! (at least in G dimension)\n+ More suspense and refined storyline! (Just play until the end)\n+ THE BGM!!!\n+ Each weapon have fixed preset of Rush, Power and Standard. No more cheap spam attack.\n+ Positioning during battle to activate party skill!!! POSITIONING!!!\n+ Lily system now does not require mandatory 2 party member to coupling front and back!!! (HELL YEAH!!!)\n+++++ Fanservice\n\nMeh\n-----\n?? HDD drive transformation eats nation shares... I prefer it to be like MK2 where it gradually eats SP overtime instead...\n?? Where are the Oracles???\n?? Where are Mages?? 5pb?? RED?? Falcom?? Etc.\n?? Where are Pururut and Peashy???\n?? Still... same old boring dungeon. No innovation...\n?? Personally I prefer Stella\u2019s \u2606 Dungeon over scout system... faster and easier.\n?? EXE skill and SP skill is under one window and not in different command (just personal preference).\n?? Battle in Sharing Field felt limited... only allows player to use skill and not normal attack. Game dev should improvise it in the future.\n?? Route building felt unnecessary. Instead, why not making the routes as a full explorable map instead of route point?\n?? I notice a bit of lagging when compared to PS4 counterpart. I have a quite decent gaming PC rig with Radeon 7970 though...\n?? I'm not a fan of the Challenge mode though... too much time wasted.\n\nCons\n-----\n- If Megami KO in battle == ate large chunk of nation shares... WAT!!?? THIS IS PUNISHING!!!\n- Scout exploration outcome heavily random... detecting hidden treasure waste a lot of time even in NG+ which makes...\n- NO HIDDEN TREASURE SCAN ABILITY!!! WHY DID YOU REMOVE THIS??\n- ORNAMENTS BECOME ACCESSORIES!!??? WHAT?? (Now only Armors, Idea Chip and weapon give increased stat...) OH PULEEEZZZ!!!\n\nOverall\n--------\nI still believe MK2 (the PS3 version - not Rebirth:2) battle system is slightly better than the other main Neptunia titles, as MK2 utilising both AP and SP system approriately. However overall, Megadimension Neptunia VII delivers better content as well as gradual improvement over its predecessors. As a Neptunia fan, there are no dissatisfaction in playing this. I give this game a solid, umio out of seaman!!\n\nShould you buy it?

Once i've beaten the game, I will change my review to positive as long as this flickering and artifacting stuff doesn't reappear.

But no. I bought this game again, along with all it's character DLC, on the PC, just to show Compile Heart and Idea Factory that the Neptunia series is one of the best thing that they have ever created. \n\nThe game itself is pretty good, and serves as a great entry point for newcomers to the series. The only thing you'll be missing for not playing the previous games will be a few random references relating to them. They added a ton of fancy new gameplay elements, but it's still the same Nep formula, so those who have actually played the other Nep games won't feel alienated in the slightest. In fact, almost all of the additions are vast improvements from the other Nep games, making this game probably the best Nep game in the series thus far.\n\nThis game is actually crazy complex, so I'm not going to delve too deep into things. If you want to know more about this game, then go read some other review, or actually buy the game. The game comes with tutorials. Read them. Seriously though, it's a good game. Everything you need to know is explained as you play along, from the combat to the storyline. The only noteworthy flaw is that on lower end PCs, don't expect this game to peak at more than 20 FPS at any point. IF and Compile Heart really decided to jack up the graphics, given that this is a PS4 game, and all the previous Nep games were either PS3 or PSVITA games. Seriously though, having a GTX 960 as a reccommended requirement is pretty intense for a JRPG, even if it's a PS4 game. Other than that, the gameplay is solid, and I would recommend this to anyone who is a Nep fan, or really just likes JRPGs in general. The art is drawn by Tsunako, and it looks fantastic The gameplay and story are also both amazing.

Although its not necessary to play thru the previous series, there are some references in the game that relates to the previous series. \nThe game has a lot of features borrowed from Fairy Fencer such as item development, unlocking ranks for quests, sound effects and the scouts giving effects to the dungeons.

HEAVY SPOILERS ARE COVERED! READ THE SPOILERS AT YOUR OWN RISK  **[/b]\n\nIm memory of my CS knife. RIP\n\nYou might've already guess it: Yes, I am a big fan of the HDN franchise. I mean, right now I am having a Green Heart profile picture. But that doesn't mean I always am a blind follower of the decisions IF made about gameplay! I always have to critizise SOMETHING a game is not doing well, or at least not at its best. While it was a...\"different\" gameplay in HDN 1 (not talking about the Re;births here!) or monotonicity reagrding enemy models/dungeons in Victory, this game was another attendant to be critizisied!...Except I actually don't have to critizise that much which is just...wow.\n\nI need to mention that I have been playing this game a lot on my PS4. 100+ hours\n\nI am structuring my review this way:\n[b] 1. Story [/b]\n[b] 2. Gameplay [/b]\n[b] 3. HDN-worthyness? [/b]\n[b] 4. Performance on PC [/b]\n[b] 5. Conclusion [/b]\n\n[h1] Story (9.8/10) [/h1]\n\nOur heroine Neptune buzzes off in the park again just to find a mysterious console in a dark, shady alley. And why the heck so ever, the console can talk! After bringing that console to Nepgear, the Nepsters(The Nep-sisters) turn on the console!...just to be sucked into a vortex which leads our dear Nepsters into a different location (Either after progressing through the story just reading the title screen after pressing \"new game\", you'll know it's the Zerodimension) .\nImmediantly afterwards you'll find Uzume Tennouboshi, a VERY important character (telling by the hype or just LOOKING AT THE GOD DAMN SCREENSHOTS OF THE GAME).\nSo...what actually happened? Why? Can the Nepsters go back to their home? Who is this Uzume? Why is there smoke around her in one of the pics on the storepage? Why am I asking so many questions? And can we get Neptune some god damn pudding please?\n\nAll of these questions (well, at least most of them) will be answered while playing the game!\n...at least the first chapter.\nYes, you read right: First chapter!\nThis game offers us a total of 3 chapters which is just magnificent! Each of them plays in different locations which I will be covering briefly ([b] if you dare to read some spoilers [/b])\n[spoiler] The first chapter is obviously the Zero dimension: In this one you will mainly find out stuff about Uzume and how the Nepsters are able to get back to the Hyperdimension\nThe second chapter covers a big scandal in the Hyperdimension: After losing a fight (which you can't win anyways), the whole Hyperdimension changed! Not only a bit, everybody seems to have forgotten who our precious goddesses are!\nThe third chapter is, what I like to call it, the big f***fest of f***ing your brain because this is where most of your questions are being answered! [/spoiler]\n\n[h1] Gameplay (8.5/10) [/h1]\n\nRemember me saying I critizised the gameplay of the previous games a lot? Well, I did aswell in MDN VII...the thing is that [b] there isn't really much to hate about it [/b].\nIt is like they took the best aspects of the games and put them into MDN VII while removing the stuff people hated!\nWhere do I start...the combat system has been kinda revamped: You can only walk in a limited, circle shaped area (MK2). Attacking while fulfilling certain conditions (combo trait) gives the reward of dealing more damage.  Even which attacks you can use is determined by the weapon your character wields. Sword A allows you to have 3 power slots, but only 1 rush and 2 standard while sword B offers 5 rush, but only 1 power and 1 standard slot + no stacking of attacks, [b] TACTIC FOLKS [/b].\nQuick explaination:\nRush attacks are attacks with many hits but rather low damage, ideal for filling up the EXE gauge.\nPower attacks are strong attacks which aren't good at filling up the EXE gauge but do their job when having to deal a lot of damage with normal attacks.\nStandard attacks are a mixture between rush and power.\nSkills aren't op anymore and EXE attacks are weaker than in the previous games, meaing they aren't an instant win if your EXE gauge is filled up. But for compansation reasons we get more skills for our characters and the socalled \"formation skills\". Simply put: Certain formation, same state (HDD or no HDD...that's the question), certain characters, ???, profit!\nCoupling skills, lily skills...while it may seem like a small amount of things I listed, trust me: It's A LOT while playing, and I didn't even cover everything!\n\nThere are only 3 things I didn't like about MDN VII regarding gameplay:\n[list]\n [*] [b]Missing GP.[/b] \nI actually enjoyed the GP system due to the fact that it made me plan when to strike: Since the GP points recharge when depleted, a full frontal attack with every character when the points are depleted was the opportunity to deal massive damage. It made me think to even attack the enemy if he has a few GP points left or to just buff myself and prepare for the later phase of a fight.\nSadly it's not in MDN VII. But well, many people didn't like it so it is reasonable to remove.\n [*] Grinding not really needed.\n I tend to grind a lot. My rule of thumb was \"each chapter requires 10 levels\" (previous games). Now it's just enough to gain 2-3 levels when the enemies are too difficult.\n [*]Monotonicity regarding enemies.\nWhile expanding the dungeons to be bigger and even using a lot of different looks of the dungeons themselves, one things sadly mostly remained the same: The frequency of seeing the same enemy model with the difference of being reskined/in a different colour. It isn't bothering, it'd just be cool if they'd not look the same.\n[/list]\n\nOverall: SOLID gameplay, minor downsides\n\n[h1] HDN-worthyness? (10/10) [/h1]\n\nI will keep this part short: DEFINETLY.\nThe story just somehow [i] feels [/i] like Hyperdimension yet it doesn't! It's a welcome mix of ideas for the HDN franchise. But otherwise?\nYes, the humour is just...neppy. Neptune's being Nep again, Vert and Blanc when talking about [i] the upper part of the torso [/i], Noire's being Noire, Uzume's being a VERY interesting, creepy, funny person...Talking about the other characters would blast my review.\nPlay the game yourself. You'll feel like home if you know the HDN-feeling.\n\n\n[h1] PC-performance (8.5/10) [/h1]\n\nOverall the performance of the game is good. Looks like the PS4 version.\n\nWould be great if I wouldn't have to critizise something: Game kind of has to load a bit when starting to play it (when engaging into a fight after booting the game). I don't mind it but some people might be bothered\nUpdate 4.8.2016:\nTested the game for the frame drops today, no drops (only when \"L2-ing\"(skipping) fights). Highered the points this section gets.\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nMagnificent, brilliant game. It really feels like the developers took their time, money and effort to make the game better in almost every possible there is! I really tried to find things that concerned me about the game...but there aren't many. And even the things that bothered me were rather minor.\n\n[h1] 9.4/10 [/h1]\n\nPS: I didn't buy any DLC and I don't intend to buy any.

So I have no objections with that, without spoiling the story too much (already beaten it a few times in PS4) I'll say it manages to strike a better balance between comedy and drama than ReBirth 2, it knows exactly when to stop taking itself seriously, that's a good thing.\nGiant boss battles are entertaining, though one might say there are few of them, they come at the right moments to make them meaningful.\nThey also brought back CPU transformation cutscenes, when you activate HDD form, you're treated to a short cutscene of waifu's transformation into CPU, never skipping those, they're so damn cool!\n\nCombat is a bit more streamlined, the basics are there, you have up to 5 hits per turn, but there's no more Guard Break mechanic so the Break attacks are now named \"Standard\" and fill a middle ground between Power attacks damage and Rush attacks EXE drive fill. Combo length is now affected by the weapon the character is holding, each weapon has a first attack of one fixed type (Rush, Power or Standard) and then it has one or more combo slots in each type of hit (eg: you can have a weapon with 1 fixed Rush slot, and following it 1 more Rush, and in parallel 2 Power and 4 Standard slots).\nIn addition many attacks have a \"combo trait\", which gives your next hit additional damage when you fulfil the combo trait condition for it.\nSort of replacing the Guard Break mechanic, you now have some monters which have breakable body parts, these are usually located and can only be attacked from a specific side of the monster (ie: back, left side, right side, etc), this gives a somewhat tactical approach to combat, since breaking parts can help by reducing one monster's defense, as well as negating the use of certain skills on some others, sadly once you start overleveling the dungeon monters by a tiny bit this is no longer really needed, but it's an interesting system to develop further in sequels (yes please give me MOAR NEP)\n\nThere are also leveling and lily rank system changes, regarding leveling, only your front row characters will get experience from fights, this can look like downer compared to previous games, rest assured though, again trying to not spoil too much, you'll hardly have a party of more than 4 characters during your first playthrough, and by the time you have a full roster, you can easily create game discs with the Racing idea chip, which allows characters to gain exp when not in the front line (gives the \"Learning\" ability).\nLily rank has also seen some changes, like exp, lily rank is now increased between all members of the front row once you finish a battle, as opposed to the previous front+back row pair system.\nPrevious lily rank increasing actions between characters still work though, such as buffing, healing one ally or allies, using items on allies, and also switching the front row character with the back row coupled one will increase lily rank between them.\n\nLast but not least, this is the first Neptunia game I felt like being \"harder\" than the others, midway through the game you'll notice you are tossed into the world being underleveled for the mobs you have to fight, so it will require some grinding and good use of combo traits, skills and whatnot, it's not something that will take a huge amount of time though, it lasts long enough to make it challenging and not boring, suffice to say, if you got the DLC weapons this does not apply at all to your playthrough.\n\n[b]TL;DR here[/b]\nWasn't expecting to write this wall of text, but I guess you can see I really DO recommend this game, it's a good step forward for the series, although it might not be trying to do a lot of new stuff, it's still refreshing enough to go back Nep'n around Hyperdimension and its companion universes :P", "timestamp_created": 1467928484, "timestamp_updated":

dimens\u00f5es diferentes !!\n\nMegadimension Neptunia VII \u00e9 o mais recente game da s\u00e9rie principal da IF e Compile, a vers\u00e3o steam \u00e9 um port, excelente, da vers\u00e3o PS4.\n\n[h1] PLOT RESUMIDO E SEM SPOILER [/H1]\n\nNeptune um dia encontra um console antigo abandonado em um beco (um Sega Dreamcast), e enquanto Nepgear planejava concertar o aparelho um portal se abre e acaba sugando as cpus de planeptune para a Zero Dimension, onde elas conhecem Uzume Tennouboshi, a CPU Orange Heart, ultima restante do planeta\n\nA hist\u00f3ria se divide em 3 episodios, mas muito maiores que os anteriores dos re;birth\n\nAcredite o primeiro epis\u00f3dio na Zero Dimension serve apenas como um tutorial de 12 Horas, o que acaba sendo at\u00e9 legal pois o jogo te preparada para v\u00e1rias funcionalidades q foram adcionadas e s\u00f3 aparecem a partir do epis\u00f3dio 2 sem jogar coisas demais na sua cara desde o inicio\n\n[h1] Gameplay e as \"novidades\" muito bem vindas[/h1]\n\nMuitas coisas que eram costumeiras para quem jogava os games da s\u00e9rie Re;Birth na Steam v\u00e3o ser uma baita novidade aqui, a principal delas \u00e9 a extin\u00e7\u00e3o do remake system e a troca pelo sistema de investimentos. O que siginifica q chega de ficar com 5 listas diferentes de itens, drops de monstros e recompensas em dungeons para ficar verificando se n\u00e3o deixou coisa pra tr\u00e1s.\n\nPode ser um ponto negativo para alguns mas acaba na minha opini\u00e3o sendo muito melhor pq vc consegue aproveitar mais da hist\u00f3ria.\n\nIsso n\u00e3o significa que os planos n\u00e3o existam, pois existem, mas agora eles funcionariam mais como receitas de um Tales of, basta vc comprar no shop os itens necess\u00e1rios e na aba development na cidade, sintetizar oq quer.\n\nA segunda novidade \u00e9 a \"explora\u00e7\u00e3o\" do World Map, agora voc\u00ea anda pelo mapa com a personagem ao inv\u00e9s de um cursor, funciona de maneira parecida com o que podemos ver em Agarest, o jogo marca uma rota das cidades at\u00e9 a dungeon, e nessa rota alguns pontos de random encounter podem acontecer. \n\nUm pouco pra frente no jogo voc\u00ea \u00e9 introduzido ao Route Building. Basicamente vc deve gastar seus cr\u00e9ditos para criar as rotas at\u00e9 dungeons ou outros pontos de interesses, normalmente numa m\u00e9dia de 100 cr\u00e9ditos por ponto da rota. Nos pontos de cidades voc\u00ea possu\u00ed os j\u00e1 conhecidos Shop (obviamente para comprar itens, oq mais seria ? , Guild com as quests j\u00e1 conhecidas, o converse onde eventos acontecem, Gallery,  e os novos Investment e Scout.\n\nNo Investment, a partir do segundo epis\u00f3dio vc pode investir cr\u00e9ditos nas cidades de cada uma das na\u00e7\u00f5es (planeptune, lastation, lowee e Leanbox) divididos em 3 se\u00e7\u00f5es. Investindo cr\u00e9ditos em Commerce o shop da cidade ter\u00e1 seu estoque aumentado com novos itens, em Industry, novos itens e planos podem ser criados e usados e em Public Relations melhora os itens q podem ser adquiridos nas dungeons adjacentes a cidade assim como os Shares, basicamente o que seria o extinto Harvest Shift dos games Re;birth\n\nInvestir fortemente em Public Relations na Zero Dimension mais tarde no game pode lhe render um bom farm de cr\u00e9ditos com itens q podem ser adquiridos.\n\nO Scout \u00e9 o novo minigame onde vc manda seus mascotes para encontrar tesouros escondidos nas dungeons j\u00e1 visitadas. \n\nOs mapas das dungeons em si s\u00e3o muito maiores e mais variados que antes, \u00e9 perceptivel isso a partir da segunda dungeon do jogo que possu\u00ed mais de um caminho at\u00e9 o ponto do seu objetivo, e os inimigos tb receberam novidades, com monstros grandes q enchem a tela.\n\nNas batalhas, algumas coisas mudaram para melhor e outras se mantiveram iguais :\n\nA melhoria pra melhor vem na parte dos combos, agora eles n\u00e3o dependem mais de pontos para serem atribu\u00eddos e sim de slots que a aarma possu\u00ed, os golpes que antes serviam para quebrar a guarda dos inimigos agora servem de meio termo entre um power move e os golpes para encher a barra de EXE......\n\n......outro golpe q sofreu mudan\u00e7as, ao avan\u00e7ar at\u00e9 a segunda dungeon vc ganha sua primeira Formation Skill, elas existem e agora podem ser usadas com mais versatilidade do que antes, ao posicionar sua party cercando o inimigo um triangulo marca que vc pode atacar com as 3 personagens ao mesmo tempo.\n\nE por falar no posicionamento, o raio de movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o foi alterando para uma barra q se esgota conforme vc anda, mas ela ainda depende do seu stats de mobilidade.\n\nE por fim os stats s\u00e3o elevados da mesma maneira que em Re;birth 3 / Fairy Fencer, onde suas a\u00e7\u00f5es em batalha e fora dela aumentam desde se HP at\u00e9 Strenght, a diferen\u00e7a \u00e9 que vc n\u00e3o precisa mais usar cada vez uma personagem como principal da Party para ganhar certos stats, basta que ela esteja na Main Party.\n\nE outra novidade nas batalhas \u00e9 as lutas contra as Dark CPUS e outros inimigos enormes, onde as batalhas acontecem numa area especialmente criadas pra elas, vc pode movimentar sua party entre pontos especificos, e dependendo do posicionamento, alguns skills podem ou n\u00e3o serem usadas.\n\n[h1]Som[/h1]\n\nEu n\u00e3o costumo falar de som de games nas minhas an\u00e1lises, mas aqui preciso dizer que Megadimension Neptunia VII tem uma das melhores OST desse ano no ramo JRPG, principalmente das Boss Battles\n\n[h1]Conclus\u00e3o [/h1]\n\nSe eu recomendo ?\n\nCompletamente, \u00e9 sem duvida o melhor de todos os Neptunia disponiveis na Steam, e \u00e9 muito bom ver que a IF e a Compile adotaram de vez a Steam como casa de NepNep e cia, visto que os spinoffs restantes v\u00e3o ser lan\u00e7ados por aqui tb\n\n[b] Planejo editar essa an\u00e1lise com mais pontos q achar interessante citar conforme for jogando[/b]\n\nMas ja garanto que vale o pre\u00e7o da promo\u00e7\u00e3o de lan\u00e7amento, e vale em pre\u00e7o integral tb se vc gosta do estilo e da s\u00e9rie, n\u00e3o vai se arrepender !!", "timestamp_created": 1467925969, "timestamp_updated": 1511377791, "voted_up":

If you are looking for more of the same Nepu~Nepu experiences. Go ahead, you will feel right at home.\n\nHowever, the reason I am giving V2 a Negative is not for the Gameplay, nor its Universe but based on my Preference itself. I am prepared for a massive down-votes by the fans who don't want their favourite title to get some Reds, but if you are interested to hear my reason, continue reading ...\n\n[h1]V2 as the VN[/h1]\n[ \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 ]\nI love it, seriously, I have no favourite waifu(s) in this universe. They did a wonderful job by adding settings like BGM fading during characters' dialogues / monologues, and etc. It is just that the current build has some weird tiny stutters during those scenes. \n\nIf you are the type that skip the most or whole VN part, you won't notice this. It is not a major issue, but it becomes quite an annoyance if you are on auto-mode, and listen to everything, staring at characters for the whole dialogue. It is understandable if you are skipping something, but it shouldn't be there during the auto-mode.\n\n[h1]V2 as the JRPG[/h1]\n[ \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 ]\nAbout average is the closest thing I can put it. It is a grindy sandbox JRPG. You are farming to level up your stats/skills, upgrade your equipments, kill the bosses, save the world, and your friends. These can be done at your own pace, can be customized to some points. \n\nHowever, despite it being improved, imho, it is still more suitable for handheld devices, not something for consoles, or PC. \n\nNeptunia series have been giving the vibes of pick-up 'n play, stop/save your progress, then put it down. I would love to play this kind of games when I'm outside, especially when I have to spend hour(s) waiting for something, but not when I am at my PC.\n\n[h1]V2 as the VN, and JRPG[/h1]\n[ \u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606 ]\nI don't feel that the grindy sandbox JRPG should be used for games that focus on interactions between characters, and story telling. I am coming to V2 to play as Nepu~Nepu~, in order to see her interacting with her friends throughout the story, not to keep on grinding to see Nepu~Nepu~ getting OP, with plots as the additional stuffs.\n\nI know that there are things that you can use to make it easy, less grindy in order to progress through the story, but imo, that is the negative for me, as it breaks the balances to the point that, the RPG parts become boring, which will turn me off from continuing the story. \n\nIt is not something likes the \"I am here for the story\" difficulty that you can find in several story centric JRPG tittles. That difficulty is tuned to balance the game so that, the RPG part is still interesting, but easy so that you steadily progress through the story, while, the harder difficulty is also available.\n\nI would love to have the option to REMOVE the RPG part while keeping the VN, and have some choices to choose that affect how the stories go, but that would be in my dream.\n\nSome tittles may benefits more from this combination, but not for Neptunia, imho.\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nGood VN, and more Nepu~Nepu~ experiences, but still a bad combination with grindy sandbox JRPG for PC title. Recommended getting at better discounted price if you are not the Nepu~Nepu~ Fans. If you are new to the series, you should try previous titles in the series, which is much cheaper, with similar gameplay first.", "timestamp_created": 1467878125, "timestamp_updated": 1480061708, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.332968", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24151932": {"recommendationid": "24151932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108199745", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471132688}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fe1\u4ef0\u4e70\u4e70\u4e70", "timestamp_created": 1467877559, "timestamp_updated": 1467877559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24151919": {"recommendationid": "24151919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100167571", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498369091}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6709\u8fd9\u4e48\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bf4\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fa3\u9e21\u5730\u96f7\u793e\uff0c\u4e0d\u7ed9\u4e3b\u673a\u515a\u6d3b\u8def", "timestamp_created": 1467877467, "timestamp_updated": 1467877467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24151883": {"recommendationid": "24151883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052264187", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 3555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472589005}, "language": "english", "review": "-*fixed*- Shogun has always loved these games, but it seems Shogun can not play this game because Shoguns Xbox one controller seems to work fine untill Shogun trys to move up or down in the menu or item screen, Can not change weapons or do anything in Shoguns inventory......why nepnepu.\nOther reasons for Down vote.\n-Also Vert Voice has Changed- this is vertly bad.\n-Also Splunker is so bad and buggy Shogun hates it and has no fun in it.\n-bad optimization,controlls,bad flow of party such as not being able to play with the normal team and always having to switch from one character to another unable to stick with one set team through out the entire game and no Peashy.\n\nShogun has fixed this problem but others remain.", "timestamp_created": 1467877281, "timestamp_updated": 1468212166, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.235964", "comment_count": "50", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24151797": {"recommendationid": "24151797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137339107", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481114496}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u54fc \u5783\u573e\u6e38\u620f\u53c8\u79fb\u690d\u8fc7\u6765\u9a97\u6211\u94b1\u771f\u4ee5\u4e3a\u6211\u8fd8\u4f1a\u88ab\u9a97\u5230\u5417\uff1f \n\u4f60\u8981\u505a\u4ec0\u4e48\u522b\u78b0\u6211 \u653e\u5f00\u6211\u7684\u624b\u6211\u662f\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5c48\u670d\u7684  \u554a\u4e00\u4e00\u4e00\u4e00\u4e00\u4e00\u4e00\n\n\n\u4f60\u4eec\u8981\u76f8\u4fe1\u6211\u662f\u8fd9\u5e73\u53f0\u5148\u52a8\u7684\u624b", "timestamp_created": 1467876903, "timestamp_updated": 1467876903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615385", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24151761": {"recommendationid": "24151761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084519896", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 9061, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479837396}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u611f\u89ba\u5fc3\u9748\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u6cbb\u7652\u4e86.\n\n\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f86\u591a\u9edeArtbook!

Gross!\" - Noire 2016\nWonderful voicing on the menu. \"I'm gonna die. I'm SERIOUSLY GONNA DIEEEEE!!!\" - Nep 2016\n\nFinal verdict? As a unique kind of reviewer, I rate games based on what kind of game it is and what it tries to be. As a JRPG, I give it a 9.5\nAbsolutely wonderful. There are a few restrictions in place as part of the story, so I can respect that, but I feel like somethings could have been executed slightly better. There are also some lag issues. But hey, as a port from the PS4, that's to be expected. But over all, a WONDERFUL game.\nAs a Nep game, an easy 10/10. This is easily the best Neptunia game yet. My play time (as of yet) easily reflects that.\n\nBuy this game. You NEED to buy it if you love Neptunia. If you are just a simple RPG fan, try this game out. You are very likely to fall in love.\n\nAnd remember. Nep responsibly. I certainly have not.

I'm embarrassed to admit it and was suprised to find out the problem was because my computer decided to run the game with my integrated card instead of my GTX 960m. Needless to say I swaped the default around, and would recommend disabling the integrated even and I got a smooth 60 fps on highest settings. Now this might not be your problem, but remember to do things like check drivers, maybe even shut down background programs and use something like MSI afterburner to see where your problems are. The game might have legitamate optimization problems, but I'm getting none of it with that change I mentioned. Make sure everything is right, and if you have lower end specs you might have to suck it up and go low quality, which still doesn't look too bad if I'm being honest.\n\nOk the boring part out of the way, as I mentioned I want to review this game in full but right now I just want to point out some things I have already been pleased with.\n\nArt: Truly Tsunako's best works are in this game, neps are neppier and it is adorable. I have an artbook from Tsunako already and have gotten a sneak peak at the art already, and it's simply fantastic. Also watching her progression getting better and better as the series has evolved is quite a fun thing to observe.\n\nMusic: I have already listened to a few tracks and I really am liking them all so far, the atmosphere in the very early game already feels to be a pretty drastic improvement over previous games.\n\nNeps: The most fucking holy and purest life form, so amazing it cannot be possible in real life and leave your friends (which I don't have anymore) and family dissapointed in your life choices. But that doesn't matter when you have Nepu and friends.\n\nThat is all I have so far, but message me if you are having optimization problems.

The music is fantastic while the story isn't the same old \"Go to the end of the dungeon to fight this random villan who has to face like 8 CPU's\". \n\n-Story-\n\nThe game is seperated into 3 arcs in different locations. This allows certain characters to get the spotlight for that part of the story. What i loved a lot about Megadimension is that the story isn't as predictable as the other games (Depending on how well you know the series). And that the CPU's are brought down to their weakest state, which gives things a change of pace compared to Re;birth 3. When i was waiting for the PS4 release i was scared that i wouldn't like any of the new characters. And i was wrong because Megadimension holds my favorite villain in the series and 2nd favorite character in the series (Uzume). \n\n-Combat- \n\nI love the progression system with the weapons you can get. Because the attack combos are different in this game comapred to the other games. Under an attack there is a certain requirement that has to be fulfilled. If it is fulfilled then the attack will have a 100% chance of doing double damage. What i find most interesting about this system is that even weaker weapons can be stronger then a weapon with more STR or INT, because of the ways that the combos connect up. And now there is a new form called the \"Next Form\" which can be activated if you already have HDD up. And you gain a new EXE attack where once used brings you back to the human form (But its really powerful so its worth using).\n\n-Music- \n\nThe music is godly and no doubt about it. The music is picked perfectly for the current mood of the game and situation. This can be between boss fights, normal fights, transformations and the zone you are walking around. One of the songs made me even tear up when i first heard it (Katharsis).\n\n-Conclusion-\n\nYes this is the best Neptunia game out there and is worth a shot. Especially since there is a 40% discount for the first week of release. P.S.

the others in every way. \n\nDungeons are larger and more elaborate, things move along faster and combat appears to be more complex, there's new characters, more in game rendered animations, the general dialogue events are better as well with more characters on screen and more animated in general. \n\nAs I said with the dungeons, I arrived at the second one and the areas are much larger and have more paths and aren't as bare bones as previous games, meaning there might be more gameplay vs dialogue dumps this time around. Combat has more depth to it, where positioning your characters can enable special moves and it seems harder to spam stuff like in previous titles as much. \n\nGadzooks, there's NEW stuff in the game, new music, sound effects are new and more UMPHY, animations are better looking from what I can tell. New portraits, new moves, new AREAS and they don't look like N64 levels anymore, new battle type! \n\nIt kinda feels like they jammed Neptune into Fairy Fencer, down to the victory poses at the end and level up poses. \n\nThe DLC is .... well if you like being broken over powered then go for it, otherwise all the equipment is too strong, nor can you sell it. You can however disable it or just not use it. \n\n\nAt the time of writing: \nThere are issues with the game, the depth of field option seems to bring even my GTX970 down to 45~FPS, turn it off and you'll have a solid 60. There's some audio balance problems as well, the second dungeon has this weird construction or industurial sound that is incredibly loud and I had to lower the SFX setting. I also had to edit my general control settings as it mapped my trigger buttons to R/L on the dpad which conflicted with the dpad controls in general. \n\nIF is obviously going to fix this as they've been pretty good with previous games with updating them to fix most issues (except the world map theme from Rebirth 2 which is still way too loud, but there's a mod for that so ...there's that)", "timestamp_created": 1467809828, "timestamp_updated": 1467846488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702363", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24133298": {"recommendationid": "24133298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103441823", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477765279}, "language": "english", "review": "Scoundrels, heretics,Nepnep believers!\nListen!

I've played only up to the first boss since I bought it yesterday and I have to say that I already recommend it. Let's go over a few things.\n\nGraphics: 7-9/10\nI dunno if the engine or the way the game is rendered has changed, but I seem to have trouble running it without being on the lowest settings on my laptop smoothly when on the battle map. However, I was able to run Victory/V-Generation perfectly fine without any problems. The game still looks beautiful though. +1 for new Histy story sprite. Seems to be a mixture of map details + enemies, some maps I can run smoothly, some maps I can't.\n\nMusic: OMGWTFAWESOME-13/10\nHad me from the OP. Background music seemed to be something they really revamped and caught my attention much more easily. A few nostalgic tracks are in there, but YES, it's good.\n\nStory: Can't rate yet, but from what I've played so far, already gripped me and not just for NepuNepu's adventurers.\n\nEdit: STORY IS 10/10, characters you think about make an appearance and also the underlying mystery present in the game along with some of the early twists captivated me and even though I'm hardly past the first major boss battle, I find myself wanting to discover more. An amusing and well-put cast already, looking forward to advancing through the game.\n\nBattle Mechanics/Gameplay: \nStandard world map in battle zones. New world map is a little rough to get used to, but I feel like I'll adapt to it right away. As for battle mechanics, I LOVE the overhaul. No more is it just \"pick your most powerful attack/attack that eats up most CP and spam\". Attacks now boost other attacks based on what came before them, so you can strategize about what moves to place and where. The new EXE gauge attacks aren't nearly as exploitable plus battlefield positioning because much more important.\n\nNepuNepu: MAX/10\nIt has NepuNepu.

I haven't played this yet but I've very much enjoyed all of the previous games so I know I'll enjoy this one.\n\nPros: A new nep nep game, you can never get enough of nep nep.\n\nCons: The DLC is overpriced BS. The DLCs shouldn't cost so much, The other nep nep games had DLCs that were priced fairly, this games DLC's is just a cash grab. I'm not saying they are bad DLCs, I got the edition that came with all of the DLC. I'm somewhat disappointed that Compile Heart decided to do this. I hope this doesn't become a common thing in new nep nep games where they make a ton of DLC and price them so rediculously high. If you're interested in the DLC, buy the version with all of the DLC now since it's currently on sale. If the DLC wasn't on sale now I never would of purchased them.

with new mechanics in their gameplay in every sequel unlike other rpgs which usually make little or no changes to the gameplay in sequels. The story is enjoyable, lovable characters and fresh new experience.\n\n    However, the PC port still faces certain problems such as screen tearing in fullscreen (should be fine in borderless and windowed), random fps drops to 20 (for me) and vertical sync function not working as intended. (I turned it off but it still locked at 60 fps).\n\n    One thing to note about this installment is that the story is a lot more meaningful and deep than the previous series so I found that rather surprising but very refreshing as an experience as well.\n\n    In conclusion I highly recommend those who love rpgs to buy this game as I really believe it will be worth the content it presents. (Though it would be great if they fixed the issues asap).", "timestamp_created": 1467793827, "timestamp_updated": 1467793827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570734", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24129251": {"recommendationid": "24129251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070422036", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1021, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489336483}, "language": "english", "review": "I already own the game on PS4 but I would easily recommend this game if you're a Neptunia fan.\n\nThis is easily one of the better PC ports of a Nep game I've seen and hasn't given me any grief so far. It seems fairly stable and despite the frame drops reported (which may be due to the particle effects) it runs relatively well provided you meet the minimum specs.\n\nThe game started as three smaller games before being put together to make V-2. It seems to work as a cohesive unit and for that it deserves some credit. The way the game feels isn't like any of the Felistella Re;Birth games, it feels more immersive. I'm guessing Galapagos RPG gave a hand somewhere.\n\nI completed the game in around 108 hours. There is more to do afterwards like obtaining items made through development or making use of DLC.\n\nAs I said above, I would recommend this to those who are already Nep fans. Those who aren't already may not feel at home if playing for the first time and the odd shower scene may put some off.\nAlso right now the battle victory theme plays with a ridiculous amount of gain and the distortion can be heard as it plays. I'm sure it will be fixed in a later update.\n\nOverall, for a game which retails for \u00a330 (\u00a318 for this week only), it's very much worth the investment. The deluxe content is also a nice addition if you're interested in its extra assets.", "timestamp_created": 1467793779, "timestamp_updated": 1467793779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny":

delivers a fantastic gem that touches your heart and makes you smile and laugh the whole way through. Seriously, i've been hooked since picking up Re;Birth1 and have since looked forward to [b]every[/b] upcoming title impatiently, especially this one as of late. I didn't blink nor think twice when shelling out the $60 for the Digital Deluxe Edition of this game on Day One; I knew this game wouldn't disappoint. And I was oh-so right, moreso than I had anticipated.\n\nMegadimension Neptunia VII takes what the first 3 main series games did to the NEXT Level. Performance improvements, mechanical changes, and a huge assortment of new content makes this the [b]best[/b] Hyperdimension Neptunia game yet. The story of this gem was spawned from three originally separate titles which were all pulled together and turned into one grand adventure, spanning three whole dimensions' worth of dungeons and monsters galore. Speaking of the dungeons, there are a plethora of new types to mesh with the collection of dungeons we all know and love from the previous games. Fight your way through a huge arcade filled with all kinds of games littered about or take a trip through the \"Mushroom Kingdom\" of Lowee, complete with grassy plains and blocks Neppin' everywhere! Activate your HDD form and dominate everything in your path--although this time, this isn't even your final form! Give it your all and go even further beyond...\n\nAs with the previous titles, you're free to customize all of your party members with loads of options! Have your entire team wearing forever-panicked face masks, or go for an all-swimsuit party in the middle of a subway because...well, why not? It's a JRPG, these kinds of things happen. Each HDD form can be fine-tuned as well, allowing the player to optimize toward an element of one's choice, gain an even spread of stat boosts, or choose your parts strategically for brute offenses or impenetrable defenses. Or just mix and match to obtain your favorite HDD design and go with that--there's no wrong answer. The Hyperdimension Neptunia series is generous in giving players freedom of choice in how to play.\n\nApparently, the English translation isn't quite a direct translation from the original Japanese script, but i've yet to encounter any instances of the English script that I found to be distasteful or otherwise not good. The English script and voices just seem very natural that I would never want to change them. In fact, I personally find each voice to fit very well with the characters they belong to. A highlight example of this would be the protagonist of protagonists herself, Neptune. The voice is carefree and excited--just what you would expect from her goofball-ish, witty nature. But again, this is my personal opinion.\n\nAnyhow, if you haven't already experienced this masterful JRPG series about Neptune and her fellow CPUs of Gamindustri--and if you loved that pun I just made plus want a game filled with lovable characters and that's jam-packed with more references than you can shake your pudding spoon at...what are you waiting for? Hesitate no longer. Treat yourself to the zany adventure that started it all: [b]Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1[/b], and find yourself engrossed in a fantastic tale of revelation, friendship, and pudding.

Every day, these guardians (mostly) work tirelessly in order to ensure that the people of their nations stay happy and safe and that their lands remain prosperous as a whole. Unfortunately, that isn\u2019t quite as easy as it seems; whether it be the physical embodiment of sin attacking the world, or gross rumors on the Neptunia equivalent of 4-Chan, someone, or something, is always causing trouble. You\u2019d think that, after everything that Gamindustri\u2019s girls have faced, there would be ready for just about anything at any time. Then again, what would be the point of another Neptunia game if everything were that easy? Compile Heart\u2019s newest installation in the series, Megadimension Neptunia VII has the CPUs facing off against an opponent that spans not just all four of their nations, but multiple realities this time around. Will they have what it takes to stand up to this new threat? And, perhaps more importantly, is their adventure fun? Let\u2019s find out!\n\nMegadimension Neptunia VII\u2018s story starts off with Gamindustri, the world in which most of the Neptunia series takes place, in the midst of what could best be described as political turmoil. Though Gamindustri\u2019s four resident CPUs, goddesses in charge of watching over each of the world\u2019s four major nations, are generally quite loved by the public, there comes a seasonal period of public unrest known as the \u201cCPU Shift Period\u201d. During this time, without fail, every nation begins to become unhappy with the CPU that oversees their nation. Nasty rumors begin spreading, morale drops, and people begin calling for a new leader to step up to the plate. While the CPU Shift Period is a problem that can be overcome (until it pops back up again later, of course), it requires quite a bit of time and effort on the part of both the CPUs and those working to keep the peace within each nation. Naturally, all of the CPUs are hard at work in order to both keep the public safe and happy, and to avoid being booted out of their own nation\u2026 well, all except Neptunia\u2018s main protagonist Neptune. While she should be doing her best to keep civil unrest down to a minimum, good old Neptune has been slacking off as always, leaving her sister Nepgear with all of the work. Though the situation started out looking less-than-promising, things go from bad to worse when Neptune one day brings home an old, mysterious-looking game console (inspired by the Sega Dreamcast) and excitedly begins demanding that her sister fix it (which, of course, she does without much hesitation). Nepgear manages to fix the console without much issue, but things are never that easy; upon booting up, the console immediately begins emitting a strange energy and transports the two to a different dimension. Though the protagonists of the Neptunia series aren\u2019t unfamiliar with hopping dimensions, they weren\u2019t quite prepared for their newest destination; a sinister version of their beloved Gamindustri known as the Zero Dimension that had been completely transformed into a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Though initially wanting nothing more than to escape, Neptune and Nepgear would soon find themselves locked in battle against the threats of the Zero Dimension; threats that would chase them all the way back to their own dimension.\n\nMegadimension Neptunia VII\u2018s overall tone and progression matches those within previous installments of the series, and is very much a story-driven JRPG. The actual gameplay once again takes place through the form of standard dungeon-crawling, with players trekking through a generous number of dungeons while battling hordes of monsters and collecting treasures along the way in an attempt to get to the end in order to fight whatever boss character may be waiting. The dungeons themselves are well-designed overall and VII does a nice job of featuring different types of dungeon themes in order to make sure that things don\u2019t become stale while exploring. Exploration is really only half of the dungeon-crawling experience, though. After all, you can\u2019t have a good dungeon-crawling session without combat that is both plentiful and fun. Fortunately,   The combat within VII is very similar to that of Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory, featuring a battle system that not only emphasizes traits of combo-centric traditional turn-based combat, but both character positioning and movement as well, meaning that characters are not only able to perform actions such as attacking or using items during their turn, but move around the field as well. Standard attacks, special moves, and items all have ranges, with some having additional features such as being able to attack all enemies within a certain proximity, so an extra layer of strategy is needed when considering how to engage the enemy. \n\nhttp://www.heypoorplayer.com/2016/07/05/megadimension-neptunia-vii-review/\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1467777978, "timestamp_updated": 1467777978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24125628": {"recommendationid": "24125628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136172954", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 7184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488666812}, "language": "english", "review": "+ I like to make theories about Uzume's history \n+ friendly dogoos\n\nMASTERPIECE", "timestamp_created": 1467777776, "timestamp_updated": 1467778508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24125571": {"recommendationid": "24125571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074385674", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481822358}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally able to nepnep at new neptunia version^^", "timestamp_created": 1467777558, "timestamp_updated": 1467777558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24125563": {"recommendationid": "24125563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044760997", "num_games_owned": 382, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503357757}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want an overview of the game as a whole, check out other reviews that have gotten further into the game or those who have played it previously on the PS4. This review is a first impression when compared to the previous three games.\n\nHere is a basic rundown of things that caught my attention early on that felt very different from the previous games:\n\n1. Comboing is less about spam and skills feel more unique. You can now only have ONE combo attack type (ex. Mega D-Drive) in the power row and no more than once. This means you won't have the same attack down the entire power row and will have to fill it in with other skills. This rule is also for the rush tree (which now ONLY builds up EXE. No more SP gains) and the new standard tree (mix of both power and rush) that replaces the ol' break tree since enemies no longer have a guard bar. Weapons will also determine what combo slots you have open and you no longer have a limit on skill cost since that's been done away with. \n\n2. Enemies have 'parts' now. Depending on where you attack from or what attacks you use, you may damage parts of the enemy. When those parts are destroyed the enemy's attacks and/or defense will change thus making combat more interactive.\n\n3. The game is now challanging (Without DLC weapons/items). Enemies and you are both pretty fragile so this means you'll need to land those symbol attacks for a strong start. I find myself burning through items unlike the previous games. You might be tempted to use skills to end fights quickly and to avoid losing too much HP, but make sure you don't lose all your SP when you need it most! Reminds me of the Black Heart fight in Re;birth 1 where I had to actually think about what I was doing, while the rest of the game was brainless.\n\nThese are things I noticed right off the bat after playing the previous three games and I felt like sharing these discoveries with those who have played the other games and are wondering what sort of differences there are between this and the old games. This doesn't even cover formation skills, completely new areas and monsters instead of recycled content, and an amazing soundtrack of new songs and previous ones.", "timestamp_created": 1467777511, "timestamp_updated": 1467777511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468338", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24125463": {"recommendationid": "24125463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101777197", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470037162}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4fe1\u4ef0nc\u7c89\u4e00\u679a\uff0c\u5bf9\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u5bb9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u505a\u5ba2\u89c2\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7 >w<\n\n\u4f46\u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u79fb\u690d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u5728\u662f\u8ba9\u4eba\u5934\u75db\u2014\u2014\u8fd9\u8f88\u5b50\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u4e3a\u4e86\u73a9\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f8e\u5c11\u5973\u6e38\u620f\u5355\u72ec\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e86\u5f00\u72ec\u7acb\u663e\u5361\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b9e\u9645\u6e38\u620f\u91cc\u5e27\u7387\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fbe\u5230\u4f20\u8bf4\u4e2d\u768460f\uff08NV GTX960m  intel i7-4720HQ\uff09\n\n\u867d\u7136\u79fb\u690d\u80af\u5b9a\u662f\u8981\u8d5e\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u591f\u591a\u8003\u8651\u4e00\u4e0b\u8d2b\u56f0pc\u515a\u7684\u611f\u60c5\u554a\u2026\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1467776950, "timestamp_updated": 1467776950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562268", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24125400": {"recommendationid": "24125400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027953483", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502118847}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly walletcrusher nep.\n\n10/10 No regrets.", "timestamp_created": 1467776659, "timestamp_updated": 1467776659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460616", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24125343": {"recommendationid": "24125343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090717797", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480018143}, "language": "english", "review": "Noire best waifu, Noire best waifu, Noire best waifu.", "timestamp_created": 1467776446, "timestamp_updated": 1480018110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24125335": {"recommendationid": "24125335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046562545", "num_games_owned": 452, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 3945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471230687}, "language": "english", "review": "Even more polished and refined than Victory. The dialogue and gameplay are as fun as the other main series games, so if you liked those you'll like this one too. Runs great too, no frame drops at all compared to the previous games; they've gotten a lot better at optimizing these for PC. \n\nI'll list the main differences below.\n\nCOMBO SYSTEM:\n1) \"Break\" combo hits and the break system aren't there anymore. Instead now you have \"standard\" combos which are a mix between rush and power.\n2) Your combo slots and starting hit vary depending on the weapon you have equipped. You can't equip two of the same combo move anymore;\n3) Combo attacks now guarantee a crit if you meet their combo condition.\n\nMAP EXPLORING:\n1) There are breakable objects in the map, though as of my 3 hour playthrough I have not yet unlocked what I need to break them.\n2) Hidden treasures are back, though it looks like there's only a set number per dungeon and they don't regenerate anymore.\n3) The world map has this sorta Super Mario 3 thing going on where you travel in between nodes. Random chance of encountering an enemy too.\n\nCOUPLING/LILY:\n1) Front and back battle setup is the same, though now coupled characters can share 10% of either their offensive or defensive stats with their partner.\n2) In the options, you can enable notifications for when a lily rank goes up (very useful as you would always have to manually check in the previous games)\n\nNegatives (all pretty minor):\n\n1) Game's still frame locked at 60fps (an issue for some)\n2) The giant battles are a bit disorienting due to their scale\n3) Traveling on the world map is a bit slow, even with the speed up button held down\n4) A lot of the maps will sometimes have graphical flickering. Some more than others, it gets annoying.\n5) Seems like only front line fighters get xp now, as opposed to everyone getting xp in previous games.\n\nNote: I'll edit the review to add anything else I find later, as I've only played 3 hours so far.", "timestamp_created": 1467776412, "timestamp_updated": 1468798587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24124983": {"recommendationid": "24124983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101951043", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 3454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502895989}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u597d \u975e\u5e38\u7684\u597d \u5267\u60c5\u76f8\u5f53\u4e0d\u9519 \u6bd4\u8d77rebirth\u4e09\u4f5c \u8fd9\u7b80\u76f4\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6e38\u620f \u867d\u7136\u4e3a\u4e86\u8d76\u8fdb\u5ea6\u6ca1\u6709\u770b\u5b8c\u5168\u90e8\u5267\u60c5 \u4f46\u6211\u662f\u5927\u6982\u4e86\u89e3\u7684 \u5efa\u8bae\u5404\u4f4d\u4e0d\u592a\u4e86\u89e3\u5267\u60c5\u7684\u80fd\u82b1\u4e0a\u65f6\u95f4\u597d\u597d\u53bb\u770b\u770b \u5f88\u6709\u610f\u4e49\uff01\n\u53e6\u5916\u5410\u69fd\u62bd\u5361\u7cfb\u7edf \u6ca1\u6709\u9632\u8138\u9ed1\u673a\u5236 \u4f60\u4e5f\u8bb8\u62bd\u4e2a\u4e00\u5e74\u6389\u4e00\u5f20ssr \u4e0d\u50cf\u7089\u77f340\u5305\u5fc5\u5b9a\u4e00\u6a59\u5361 \u9b54\u517d\u73a9\u4e2a\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\u6bcf\u5929\u4e00\u4e2a\u7bb1\u5b50\u5fc5\u5b9a\u4f1a\u6709\u6a59\u88c5 \u6240\u4ee5\u591a\u6d17\u6d17\u8138 \u51c6\u5907\u4e2a\u597d\u70b9\u7684\u624b\u67c4\u6216\u8005\u952e\u76d8 \u5f00\u59cb\u809d\u809d\u809d\u5427\uff01\n\u795d\u5404\u4f4d\u65e9\u65e5\u767d\u91d1\u5168\u6210\u5c31\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1467775144, "timestamp_updated": 1486311126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487118", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24124969": {"recommendationid": "24124969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069024848", "num_games_owned": 2196, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469605921}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7adf\u7136\u4e0d\u662f\u60ef\u4f8b\u768488....\u6709\u70b9\u4e0d\u8d70\u5fc3\u554a....\n\u597d\u4e0d\u597d\u73a9\u7684\u53cd\u6b63\u90fd\u5dee\u4e0d\u591a.\u840c\u5c31\u662f\u6b63\u4e49\uff01\n\u561b.\u53cd\u6b63\u7167\u5e38\u5148\u558a...\u6211\u8981\u6c49\u5316\u554a\uff01\u6c42\u6c49\u5316\u554a\uff01...", "timestamp_created": 1467775082, "timestamp_updated": 1467775082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582339", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24124886": {"recommendationid": "24124886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116305086", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501854140}, "language": "english", "review": "Not played much, but I did play through the entire PS4 version so it's all good.  \n\nThe game looks just as beautiful as it did on the PS4, but the high-end requirements are the only things I'm bummed about.

The game takes place across a total of three dimensions (Zero, Hyper, and Heart) with lots of gloomy and hilarious moments from Gold Third, AffimaX, and the main cast. \n\nOne day Neptune happens to stumble upon a console one day and decides to bring it back home. While she and Nepgear inspect it, they get sucked in a warp and end up in the Zero Dimension, a barren wasteland of a nation. They meet Uzume Tennouboshi and her fish companion with a human face Umio who both have been struggling to bring down the \u201cDark CPU\u201d\n\nGameplay is what you would expect from other Neptunia titles with some slight changes. For starters, weapons play a slightly more prominent role as in the most powerful weapons usually won\u2019t cut it anymore.  Weapons now excel and lack in either of the 3 combo types (ex. Long rush combo/short power combo). The EXE Drive Gauge also resets after every battle but fills up quicker compared to past titles. Next-Gen forms are also a new thing where the Goddesses\u2019 go beyond their HDD form.\n\nOne thing that might annoy everyone is the revamped World Map. Gone are the days of just simply picking a dungeon and entering immediately.

[i]Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth[/i] was a pleasant surprise due to its colorful cast and amusing storyline. The second Re;Birth game was a solid improvement. The third game was even better, but it was also more of the same. At the time, I thought that this RPG series was long overdue for a fresh take, but I started to worry that it would never happen. I envisioned that Compile Heart had grown complacent. They would continue to hammer these Neptunia RPGs out, all with slightly different storylines, five or twenty additional characters, and memes more \"dank\" than ever thought possible. With the release of [i]Megadimension Neptunia V2[/i], Compile Heart has put my worries to rest. This is, without a doubt, the best entry in the series thus far. \n\n[h1]The Story and Characters[/h1]\nDespite having \"V2\" in the title, this entry in the saga has very little in common with \"V1\" aka Re;Birth 3. In fact, if you have at least some familiarity with the CPUs and the Candidates, then you could probably approach V2 as its own self-contained story. Without giving too much away, this game is divided into three separate acts. Each act focuses on a handful of characters, and their efforts to protect Gamindustri from a mysterious threat. The storyline is darker than in previous games, but it never becomes overbearing, or gritty just for the sake of it. The truly serious moments feel earned. Even accounting for the franchise's penchant for farce, the villains are well-written, and the heroines deal with the problems facing them in a convincing fashion. \n\nAlongside the improved story-telling is a very strong cast. With Re;Birth 2 and especially 3, CPU Candidate Nepgear went from mediocre to almost unsalvageable. This is her best role yet. Big sister Neptune has also improved. Well, she's still as ridiculous as ever, but at least she's not completely irritating. Noire, Blanc, Vert, and Uni also have more involved roles in the storyline, which is a huge plus. As far as new characters go, Uzume is exceptional. Her story is well thought-out, and her quirks are endearing rather than grating. The Golden Third represents the \"developer\" characters that are common in Neptunia games (Cave, Red, Mages, etc). Again, I have nothing but praise for them. Rather than being a mere excuse to include several references and in-jokes, each of these four characters has their own arc.\n\nWhile it would have been nice to see a few characters from the previous Neptunia trilogy make an appearance, I believe that sticking with just the main heroines and the handful of newcomers, was a very wise decision. There aren't as many meaningless skits, and conversations don't get buried by dozens of people voicing their thoughts at once. The three-act storyline neatly ties everything together.\n\n[h1]The Game[/h1]\n\nCompile Heart has made changes to nearly every element of its bread & butter RPG. The dungeons are slightly larger, house more secrets, and can involve a little platforming. This provides another incentive for players to jump around, aside from the stat-boosting challenges and the ability to loudly exclaim \"I'm a kangaroo!\" The structure of this game has also undergone a massive overhaul. In the previous games, it was easy to unlock optional dungeons, defeat the side-bosses, and enter a cycle of constant level-ups that removed any semblance of challenge from the main story. There's still more than enough side-content in V2, but unless you're really determined, you won't reach a \"kill-all-bosses-in-one-hit\" level of experience... At least until new game+.\n\nThe remake system has been removed from Gamindustri. While you can still gather monster materials to craft some items or enhance gear, you won't need [i]gamefaqs[/i] the entire time you're playing. Most gear acquisitions are handled the old fashioned way; via store purchases, or finding them in dungeons. Other unlockables, like the \"cheat\" abilities (higher jump, faster run speed, etc) are discovered simply by playing through the game. Furthermore, by employing scouts, you can discover additional treasures and new dungeons. So, if you disliked Stella as much as any normal person, you'll be happy to know that she was kicked to the curb. While these changes might disappoint some Re;Birth fans, overall they improve the pacing and atmosphere. Your play-through of the game isn't under constant risk of being halted, just so you can look up how to find a \"old dragon ball\", an \"old dragon horn\", or the all-important \"old dragon's ?!?!?\" \n\nHowever, some of the other changes & additions are a little undercooked. The overworld no longer functions as a \"click on the location to instantly travel\" map. Now you have to selection your destination, and the protagonist will run to wherever that is. The reason I don't like this setup is because there are random encounters. While they aren't too annoying, I really have to wonder why they exist. Random encounters can be turned off after beating the game. This is equal parts welcome and perplexing. A number of other unlockables such as scouts, clothes, and weapon modifications are awarded by investing in all of the major lands (Planeptune, Lastation, etc). It's a neat idea, but you're liable to spend most of the game dirt-poor. In fact, by the time you have the opportunity to do any serious investing, your first play-through is about to end.\n\nThe battle system has also undergone some slight modifications. The EXE meter resets after every battle, and overall isn't nearly the \"win\" button it was in the past. To balance this out, all of the playable characters have recieved more moves and abilities. The combo system has also been revamped. Certain combination attacks can result in longer waits, which effects the heroine's turn order. Combo attacks can also do more damage if certain conditions are satisfied (such as performing a rush attack just before a power attack). The differences aren't dramatic, but if you're attempting to play through the game at low levels of experience, they can be pretty important. Positioning is also more tactical than ever, since enemies (and playable characters!) take more damage, when attacked from the sides or back.\n\nWhile this game is harder than its predecessors, most of the challenge is going to come from early on. The first half of the game is spent with less than four party-members. These limitations alongside a lack of primo grinding points make for a decently balanced level of difficulty. Once you recruit everyone, the battles devolve into the typical attack/special move/sometimes heal doldrums that plague most RPGs. Still, it's nice while it lasts, and players can opt out of carrying over their experience levels and equipment in new game+. \n\n[h1]In Conclusion[/h1]\nWith [i]Megadimension Neptunia V2[/i], Compile Heart has proven that they aren't averse to taking risks with an established series. Taking these risks not only requires a lot of confidence in the game-designers, but also the writers. Yes, there are still times where Neptune acts the fool, or Vert jokes about Blanc's lack of \"plot\" development. These moments are what keep the adventure grounded. More importantly, the writing goes above and beyond to give everyone a purpose beyond the cheap laughs, and this leads to a more compelling story. While I've enjoyed all of the previous Neptunia games, V2 is a necessary evolution. The improvements to both the combat systems and exploration help round out this superb RPG.\n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1467748959, "timestamp_updated": 1467749328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 323, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.871361", "comment_count": "32", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

I bought this collection as soon as I heard about it and I don't regret it all. The combat in this game is a bit simple with a single attack button and the abillity to map four special skills at any time but it works and well it's not the greatest combat system ever, can even be enjoyable. The graphics have really been stepped in this collection from the originals and are great to look at. \n\nThe setting is easily the best part this game has going for it.

This game aged like fine wine. It looks and plays incredibly well. 9/10\n\nStory wise, this game was always very deep and intriguing. If you have or haven't played you're still going to be wow'd. 8/10\n\nVoice acting is about what you would expect from the era, but for the time it was pretty damn good. As there isn't live conversations and instead audio clips blended, it can cause a slight distraction or loss of feeling but overall still pretty great. 6/10\n\nGameplay still holds up. Yes, it's a bit PS2, but we're accounting for it being a PS2 game. 8/10\n\nPLAYABILITY. This is an important one. A lot of remasters/remakes are riddled with bugs or frame rate caps. As of right now, I'm getting between 60-144fps steady. Depends on whether I'm in game or in cutscene. It all blends well, and there have been minor bugs that aren't stopping me from playing. Most notably is where the game says I'm getting 144fps but it feels like time slowed down and I'm getting 10. I'm not sure the cause as I haven't looked into it, and I haven't looked for a fix although I'm sure there is one.    7/10\n\nCONTROLS. Another big one. Using Big Picture and a steam controller, the controls are very straight forward and are even labeled in game for the steam controller as it seems that's what they had in mind. It makes playing it very simple, and very fun. FOR CONTROLLER 10/10\nFor keyboard however, the controls are odd off the bat and there wasn't any detection whether or not I was using a controller. It kept saying \"Hit X\" \"Hit B\". This really bothers me. You can however change and view controls while NOT in game, during the title selection menu. FOR KEYBOARD: 5/10\n\nIN GAME OPTIONS are none existant and it really bothers me. You can change everything while you are in the title selection screen, but sometimes I'd like to at least be able to change volume levels as it can be a bit obnoxious at times. There really is no reason to not include this, and unfortunately as they are vitually nonexistant... 2/10.\n\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of the series or even just interested in it, I HIGHLY recommend this as it's a fantastic series, and a really well done remake.", "timestamp_created": 1516152437, "timestamp_updated": 1516152437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39379884": {"recommendationid": "39379884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027918565", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 622, "last_played": 1516161211}, "language": "english", "review": "It's so good to have this game brought onto Steam.\nI played the original 1~3 on the PS2 as they came out, and boy this game aged very, very well.\nThe combat doesn't feel outdated, and it's just as fun as I remember it being.\n\nIt's very much a \"game of it's time\" as there are a lot more cutscenes, and story than games of today.\nThere are also the situation and dialogue that are \"of it's time\", and to people who have never played any JRPGs in their lives will find that this game seems very \"anime\" in a lot of their character mannerisms. \n\nAll in all, it's a great game series, and I would highly recommend it.\nThough, you might wanna end task > touch keyboard. before starting, as that will make the game crash on PCs.\nBut it's easy to avoid, and is still worth purchasing and playing.\nThe story is very great, and focuses heavily on character development (and not just Haseo's either!)\n\nI've yet to play the fourth game, as the data carries through games 1 -> 2 -> 3 ->4\nSo why start out with a nubbie baseline Haseo in 4, when I can be OP Haseo who started from game 1?\ngg\n", "timestamp_created": 1516069755, "timestamp_updated": 1516069755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39374216": {"recommendationid": "39374216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198366478263", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3186, "last_played": 1516046337}, "language": "english", "review": ".hack gu last recode is a good collection that fixes most of the problems i had with ps2 versions like improving the growth of skill levels, better frame rate, etc. But some of the side quests are still annoying like Bikman's in volume 1 and the book of 1000 which can take up 2/3rds of your main story playtime to complete (for me it was 19 hours in volume 1 when i beat the game then i had 28 for 100%). there should have been multiple items added in the game to tell you what you were missing in an area like volume 2 or 3 but for weapons, armor, and consumables. I would have also hoped that they would fix the long pauses in cutscenes to make the conversations flow much more smoothly. the terminal discs are great but it can be almost essential to understand the backstory of the events in volume 1. Most newcomers to the series are probably going to jump right into volume 1 and not understand what is going on and if they want to understand they are going to have to watch about 45 minutes of cutscene just on terminal discs then watch 20 minutes of the opening of gu. Even after they watch the first 4 or 5 terminals that are unlocked you have to spend about another hour watching the rest as players beat each game to get the full experience. Volume 4 in all honesty feels like fanfiction that feels like it was added to sell more copies to older fans which this collection was made for them in mind. :SPOILERS: Volume 4 could have been much better if the events happend much earlier like a few months before The World went offline. With that time it could develop what haseo had to do to get his 5th form and how AIDA still exists. As it stands now the game should have been called Volume 3 epilouge. Don't get me wrong i love the .hack series and I have been waiting for something like this for years, but starting with GU was probably not the best for newcomers. If they started out with the 4 original games then it wouldn't have been as confusing since you need no backstory to enjoy those games to the fullest. At this point im just rambling, so if you want to start getting into the .hack series with this collection look up a plot analysis of .hack roots the anime of gu that show the events before gu (optional look up a wiki about the first 4 games).

J'ai aim\u00e9 faire ces jeux, mais m\u00eame en gros fan que je suis, je ne peux pas nier les d\u00e9fauts du titre. Bon le volume 4 est un cas particulier vu qu'il est sorti en 2017 pour les 15 ans de la saga Dot hack (. hack//) donc je vais le traiter \u00e0 part.\n\nPour les volumes 1 \u00e0 3, ce sont des jeux qui datent de 2006-2007 donc certaines m\u00e9caniques sont dat\u00e9s, sans parler des animations. De plus, un gros d\u00e9faut \u00e9tant qu'\u00e0 chaque jeu, le sc\u00e9nario nous fait passer syst\u00e9matiquement par l'ar\u00e8ne.

Une bonne variation par rapport \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re quadrilogie o\u00f9 il fallait explorer un champ pour trouver et faire le dongeon.

Au bout d'un moment, \u00e0 voir les m\u00eames d\u00e9cors, c'est un peu ennuyeux tout de m\u00eame.\n\nAutre faiblesse, les qu\u00eates. D'un volume \u00e0 l'autre, on se retrouve \u00e0 faire certains qu\u00eates identiques; notamment Bikman, le Mecha Grunty, les chims et les animaux porte-bonheur. Bon les PK c'est sympa.

En soit, elles permettent de gagner des objets (diff\u00e9rents \u00e0 chaque volume) et un succ\u00e8s mais elles n'ont pas beaucoup d'int\u00e9r\u00eat.\n\nJe ne vais pas entrer dans le d\u00e9tail, mais dommage que l'Avatar ne soit pas plus utilis\u00e9 que \u00e7a, au moins utilis\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment. On aurait pu avoir des passages \u00e0 la Zone of the Enders, dommage de s'\u00eatre imit\u00e9 \u00e0 une utilisation.\nUn truc qui m'a pas mal frustr\u00e9, c'est de ne pas pouvoir monter sa guilde au niveau 10 pour avoir le droit \u00e0 sa propre zone personnelle. M\u00eame la gestion de la guilde n'est pas tr\u00e8s d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e, c'est dommage. on se contente de la faire monter de niveau jusqu'\u00e0 9.\nSans oublier la faible difficult\u00e9 des jeux, car avoir 4-5 niveaux d'avance et on peut tracer les yeux ferm\u00e9s. La traduction fran\u00e7aise est parfois un peu aux fraises, et le jeu rame par moment, mais de fou. \n\nMalgr\u00e9 ces d\u00e9fauts, le plaisir d'y jouer est l\u00e0. Il y a de gros d\u00e9fauts, mais d'excellentes qualit\u00e9s aussi.\n\nLe point fort principal est le fond, ce que \u00e7a raconte. C'est \u00e9norme, c'est juste g\u00e9nial. M\u00eame si certaines id\u00e9es ne sont pas assez exploit\u00e9e jusqu'au bout (comme le tournoi du volume 3). Mais voir les \u00e9v\u00e9nements en jeu et les r\u00e9percussions \"irl\" via les news, et les forums, c'est grisant. Je ne vais pas d\u00e9velopper ces points mais c'est du bon, \u00e7a fait plaisir. Il y a vraiment de tr\u00e8s bonnes id\u00e9es.\nLes jeux datent de 2006, mais face \u00e0 plusieurs articles lu en cours de partie, je me suis demand\u00e9 si d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque c'\u00e9tait d'actualit\u00e9. Certains de ces articles semblent d'actualit\u00e9 aujourd'hui, mais \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, je n'ai pas souvenir, ou alors c'\u00e9tait moins relay\u00e9.\n\nAutre petit truc plaisant, l'\u00e9volution de son personnage. Alors une \u00e9volution psychologique, ce qui est normal mais aussi d'apparence. \u00c0 chaque \u00e9volution, d\u00fb \u00e0 une extension de classe, l'apparence change et nous donne acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une arme suppl\u00e9mentaire (glaive, faux,..) et c'est plut\u00f4t cool \u00e0 jouer, on peut ainsi switcher en cours de combat entre diff\u00e9rentes armes. Une petite chose parmi d'autres qui font plaisir.\n\nAlors le volume 4, cas particulier. C'est un \u00e9pilogue qui se torche en quelques heures seulement, surtout si on a bien pouss\u00e9 le volume pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent et que l'on commence level max. En plus, la plupart des fonctionnalit\u00e9s ne sont pas disponibles donc \u00e7a donne un aspect ligne droite pour terminer. Par contre, rien que pour l'\u00e9p\u00e9e et ses capacit\u00e9s, \u00e7a vaut le d\u00e9tour. ^^\n\nPetit bonus, le mode parodie qui d\u00e9tournent certains passages du jeu. Il y en a des dr\u00f4les.\n\nDans l'ensemble, tr\u00e8s bon jeux, riches dans le fond, mais la forme p\u00eache un peu, classique avec cette saga. Je suis heureux d'avoir pu les faire. Maintenant, j'esp\u00e8re de nouvelles productions pour cette saga, en gardant un fond riche et en s'inspirant du p'tit nouvau sao pour la forme; mais n'oublions pas que Tron (1982) \u00e9tait l\u00e0 avant.", "timestamp_created": 1515335704, "timestamp_updated": 1515335986, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39143444": {"recommendationid": "39143444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169746121", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 359, "last_played": 1515306644}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u672c\u65e5vol4\u307e\u3067\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u7d42\u308f\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u8a18\u5ff5\u306b\u3002\u3002\u3002\u7b11\n\n\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3066\u306e\u611f\u60f3\u306f\u3001\u3084\u306f\u308a\u9762\u767d\u3044\uff01\n\n1\uff5e\uff13\u3092\u3084\u308a\u76f4\u3057\u3066\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u306e\u3067\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u3042\u308a\u304c\u305f\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059\uff01\n\u305f\u3060\uff14\u3060\u3051\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\u8cb7\u3046\u306e\u306f\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u3082\u3063\u305f\u3044\u306a\u3044\u304b\u3082\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3002\u3002\n\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3066\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001DLC\u7684\u306a\u304a\u307e\u3051\u7a0b\u5ea6\u306b\u601d\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u3044\u305f\u65b9\u304c\u3044\u3044\u304b\u3068\uff01\n\n\u305f\u3060\uff14\u3067\u3067\u3066\u304f\u308b5xh\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u304b\u3063\u3053\u3044\u3044\u306e\u3067\n\u662f\u975e.hack.G.U.\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3055\u308c\u305f\u304b\u305f\u306b\u306f\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u76f4\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u305f\u3044\u3067\u3059\uff57\n\n\u7d9a\u304d\u3067\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304b\u306d\uff5e(;\u00b4\u0414\uff40)\uff57", "timestamp_created": 1515309552, "timestamp_updated": 1515309552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39116421": {"recommendationid": "39116421", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040365628", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515153298}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game and hope for new ones to be released.

I loved .hack anime series and being able to play it as the game were just amazing. I wouldn't call it amazing by modern standards, but back then I didn't know better, I guess.\n\nTo be honest today it looks kind of bland and still unpolished. The story is great as always, but the presentation is riddled with things which wold be better left back there in the past like absurdly annoying quests which you have to do 3 times each because the game divided in 3 volumes. Yes, I do understand that the game were released in 3 volumes back there due to DVD size limitations, but do we really need these volumes today on the PC? Well, they did make it easier to grind these levels now, and they added option to replay the battle if you loose, which really helps once or twice in the second and third volumes when you accidentally encounter chaotic PK in the low-level location, but these changes turned volume 1 into a massive joke since you end up overleveled all the time. The balance kicks in only closer to the end of volume 2 and never on the arena. Every time I came to the arena I were 10+ levels above which means instant win. Not like I'd lose if the enemy would be 5-8 levels ahead, but no challenge at all? Seriously? That's just boring. Well, I can continue like that for a while.\n\nAlso, back then I thought it gives somewhat accurate representation of MMORPG games (minus the crazy stuff), but honestly if you somehow haven't played MMOs yet then don't take this as a reference. MMOs are inherently unfair. ;) However, it still have a great atmosphere with that virtual in-game forum and news site and that's what's important in the Role Playing Game. You actually feel like you live in that world.\n\nAnyway, I DO recommend this game because even with all the downsides and weaknesses of an 11 years old game it's still great. Just don't expect fancy graphics. They did improve it a bit since PS2, but pretty much everything besides the main characters lacks details. Well, this is not a re-make after all, so I haven't expected anything, but HD textures and better models for the main characters and GUI anyway, which they did.\n\nNow, about volume 4. It isn't really a new chapter in the story, however it addresses a few loose ends in it and grants main character another job extension which breaks ugly-nice-fugly-nice pattern from the original 3 volumes and also nice looking and fun to play with at least for the duration of this volume. Which is really short. Well, maybe because there are nothing, but the main story anyway and you just can't walk around and do nothing, grind or meddle with that Crimson VS idle card game, or... anything else. And even half of that consists of talking to all the characters again... and again. Because Haseo just can't go straight to the point, he had to talk to everyone before going anywhere, right? Heh.

I just wish real life was like my life online.\" -Quote from an article in the game DAMN.\n\n.Hack//G.U. has a great narrative that give reason to invest time in the game. There is more than enough cutscenes to entertain the story and develop the characters. Furthermore, the fictional forums the game provides in its internet sphere offers branching narratives and lore to the world of .Hack in game and the real world. The game was ahead of its time tackling issues relevant today about technology when it becomes too much a part of our lives not just for a solution but more so for convenience (which you would have to read in the in game forum). It also makes you feel like you are in a forum with people discussing these topics like in real people. But even if you don't read them, the narrative will allude to these things or some characters will mention them.\n\nThis series was a crazy ride from start to finish. The story was amazing with a lot of feels and unexpected twists. It starts off a little slow but quickly starts to pick up as Haseo, the main character starts to learn more and more about whats going on in \"The World\" and what he has to do to meet his own goals. Most of the characters Haseo meets are very likable and you get to see them grow throughout the whole series and also help Haseo grow into a better character himself. Everytime you get a new party member you add them to your friends list like you would in an actual MMO style game which lets you invite them into your party for the story, quests, dungeons, etc. You also get the ability to trade with them and give them gifts while in a party. The game does a really good job of making you feel immersed into \"The World\" with how it has you logging out to a desktop and back into the game as if you're the one actually playing it and having a friends list full of the characters you meet throughout the story.\n\nThe combat is pretty straightforward and simple with a one button attack but you get additional skills to execute. Additionally, you also have recovery attacks for more strategy if I may say so. It doesn't sound fun from words alone but it is when you have your hands in control of the game. Gameplay allows you to do general things you'd expect from an actual mmo like guild management, arena, improve gears questing etc.. The game isn't complex by any means. It's straightforward fun as a game should be.\n\nOh! And music! Music in this game is just fascinating. I even can't say anything else about it.\n\nOverall I would definitely recommend anyone that loves RPGS and MMOs to play this amazing series because it was truly a great experience.", "timestamp_created": 1514163660, "timestamp_updated": 1514163796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565997", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38638528": {"recommendationid": "38638528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035115463", "num_games_owned": 406, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 4789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511797147}, "language": "english", "review": ".hack//GU is a game that takes place between and after the anime series .hack//Roots, It is also linked to the first 4 games released on the PS2 back in 2002. This is a treat for fans and for newcomers to the series as it expands past the 3rd disk. You get all three games bundled opposed to buying them all seperately. \n\nThe Graphics are pretty dated but slightly enhanced for the HD remake, The game has it's own little charm but suffers from the common overly reused graphics syndrome.  You will find many enemy reskins and most maps are just randomlly generated with slight alterations. Despite this, it really holds up very well.  It kinda does bother me when characters are talking and the game decides to cut in for only a few seconds only to show characters doing something subtle like a hand gesture or a simple mouth movement.  I don't remember if this was the case on the PS2 version as it has been a while since I have played it.\n\n(Spoilers here)\nStory is pretty interesting, simply put you are playing a game that goes skynet and puts people all around \"The World\" into a comatose.(Pun intended)  This boi Tri-Edge slaps your girl's butt and you aren't about to take that and end up getting your face smacked to the floor so hard you go back to level 1.  Later on you go on to solve the mysteries of Tri-Edge and come across best girl. Eventually you save the world from a deadly MMO that was still allowed to continue running despite the cultural backlash and almost dumping a can of whoopass all over the planet.\n(End Spoilers)\n\nThe soundtrack is really good, it was composed by the same person who did the previous games and you can tell  Chikayo Fukuda has only gotten better with age. \n\nThe Combat works like this,  you engage into a battle which creates a ring in which you fight enemies.   The increased fps has caused some issues from its former PS2 varient in which tap weapons require a weird timing that its almost better to just use charge attacks.  You will have access to 5 different weapons each with their own style of gameplay and each weapon can be used mid battle depending how you setup your skill triggers.  It's pretty straight forward and the game is by no means difficult if you lose in battle it's probably only because you are underleveled as enemies damage seems to stagnate to oneshot levels otherwise. \n\nMechanically the game gets extremely repetitive and leveling becomes ridiculously easy, I don't by any means think its a bad game.  If you are looking for a mindless game then play .hack//GU because its still quite fun.  Menus are easily navigated and there is memoir section if you forget what you need to do.  Party Members you want may not always be available due to how the story progresses.  Armor and Weapons can be rigged to insanely overpowered levels but this has always been the case since the PS2 version. You get a little mini desktop that you can decorate and play a idle mini game called Crimson VS which  plays itself as you play the game.   Lots of lore and flavortext to be found on the pretend online fourms and news of the outside world of the game located in the news section.  \n\nIs this game worth playing?  Yes, if you are a fan of the series otherwise find another game because you will probably be bored out of your mind.", "timestamp_created": 1514154861, "timestamp_updated": 1514155024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536517", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38596974": {"recommendationid": "38596974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308789934", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4568, "last_played": 1516447469}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u826f\u30b2\u30fc\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002\u305f\u3060\u3057\u3001\u6c17\u3092\u3064\u3051\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u306a\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3053\u3068\u304c2\u3064\u3064\u3042\u308b\u3002\nDualshock 4\u3001\u3064\u307e\u308aPS4\u306e\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u3067\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u5834\u5408\u3001\u307e\u305aXboxOne\u306e\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3092\u982d\u306b\u3044\u308c\u308b\u3079\u3057\u3002\n\u25b2\u306fY\u3002\u25a0\u306fX\u3002\u25cb\u306fB\u3002X\u306fA\u3002\n\u305d\u3057\u3066\u4f55\u6545\u304bDS4\u306e\u30ad\u30fc\u306f\u8a8d\u77e5\u3055\u308c\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u3001\n\u5b9d\u7bb1\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u30b3\u30de\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u65b9\u5411\u30ad\u30fc\u3068\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u306e\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3\u3067\u3084\u308b\u3079\u3057\u3002\n\n\u4e8c\u3064\u76ee\u306f\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb40GB\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002\n\u3053\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u309240GB\u4ee5\u4e0b\u306b\u5727\u7e2e\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u7121\u7406\u30b2\u30fc\u3067\u3042\u308b\u3002\n\u4e38\u4e00\u65e5\u304b\u3051\u3066\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9\u3059\u308b\u3057\u304b\u306a\u3044\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1514066345, "timestamp_updated": 1514066345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38540388": {"recommendationid": "38540388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125747246", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512161950}, "language": "english", "review": "perfect remaster for a great PS2 RPG\n\nalthought it's hard to enjoy the concept if you're already fan of SAO XD", "timestamp_created": 1513960257, "timestamp_updated": 1513960365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.419252", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38505381": {"recommendationid": "38505381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040854368", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513469252}, "language": "english", "review": "In retrospect, what seemed like a great and flowing combat system during the PS2 era has fallen flat,  with the single button commands and sometimes simplistic combat commands that existed in the original 3 volumes having lost their impact.\n\nThe story is great and the cast of charachters seems to really come to life through the mail, party and crimson systems, however the open map and the repetitiveness of the encounters in the field system can detract from the engagement of the narrative.\n\nWhile this is a great game for nostalgia, it pales in comparison to games which have updated their combat mechanics, even without changing graphics, such as Tales and Star Ocean.\n\nTLDR: Only buy for Nostalgia and Story", "timestamp_created": 1513892930, "timestamp_updated": 1513892930, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.417332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38489308": {"recommendationid": "38489308", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031954285", "num_games_owned": 498, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 7033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513816040}, "language": "english", "review": "The most amazing \"inside a MMORPG\" game\n\nThis game is about an average player that wants revenge on a hacker that messed up with his friend. At first, Haseo is a rebel young guy who treats everyone poorly and thinks he can do everything by himself. But as the story progresses, he grows as a person, and a lot starts to change in his objective as the truth unveils.\n\nThe port is decent. The game has this old PS2 game look to it, but it's easy to get used to it. The only problem I had was with the shadows - having them activated would sometimes kill my FPS randomly (like staring at a door would make it go below 20fps). There is a notable slowdown when many effects are happening at the same time, but this problem was also present on the PS2 and doesn't happen often\n\nThe controls are a bit clunky at first, considering the combat is action-oriented (it doesn't have the same flow of Bayonetta and DmC, for example). It's something you get used to as well, especially with animation cancelling\n\nThere were some additions to the game, like the cheat mode, which puts you in the max level and gives you a ton of items and gold. The experience gain after battles has been increased, which makes the pacing a lot better (you will outlevel some story dungeons that were supposed to be used to level though). The terminal disc is included, which contains videos about the .hack games before G.U. and some more info about what's going on\n\nThe addition of a new volume is debatable. The story feels complete at the end of Vol 3, and Vol 4 seems to be a \"good ending\" to the series. It suffers from bad design though, like making you talk to every ally before a big battle (so they can say 2 phrases), and the new mechanics are only available for several dungeons. All in all, it seems to be an advertisement for a new series\n\nIn the end, the G.U. series is amazing and definitely worth buying.

I'm now actually going out of my way to do some completionist things before moving on to volume 2, which is out of character for me.\n\nquick pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n-cutscenes are crisp and pretty\n-voice acting is mostly good for an \"anime\" type game\n-combat is solid, fun, and simple if you wanted to be, more complex if not\n-same goes for equipment \n-LOTS of things to collect and do, if you're into it. All optional, though. \n-many QOL changes from the original release, but I can't name many since I never played those. Things like faster move speed, AI party members kicking chims for you, etc\n-The music is memorable and enjoyable\n-The \"desktop\" outside of the game itself, along with the forums and continuing news stories for world building\n\nCONS:\n-areas are very limited. Aside from the special story areas, most everything looks pretty similar. I didn't feel this took away from the experience, though, yet I do hope this isn't the case for volumes and onward\n-the game is very generous with exp, and it is easy to overlevel without trying. Fights meant to be challenging were sometimes cakewalks, though a cerain post game boss was still a challenge despite this. \n-in engine cutscenes don't have lip movement. not something that bothers me, but something that's worth mentioning\n\nSo, yeah, I'd definitely recommend this based just on the first volume.

played the first volume and 30 minutes of the second. 70% of the game was not enjoyable. I think the gameplay is hit or miss. A little simple, but maybe that's fine. My problems are mostly with the game's story, and this is what this review will cover. Spoiler alert btw.\n\n---The Good---\nThis is a game where you play as a person playing an MMO called \"The World\". You are able to play \"The World\", or log out and be on your desktop. Here, you can open forums and news websites to get information about \"The World\" and \"the real world\" (the fictional real world outside the fictional MMO). This is where you will get most of your world building, and the only thing I thought was great about this game's storytelling. You can read about real-world events like rockets being sent to space, or watch some trashy news program (trashy in the sense that most things on TV these days are kinda bad) that is closely related to what happens in \"The World\". The forums provide world building for \"The World\", and it makes you feel like there is an active player base for \"The World\" (even if it is all fake). You friends (in the game), also use this forum, and you can learn a few things about them through here.\n\nThis was what made me go over my 2-hour refund playtime, and I hate how the world building was good enough to make me play for 20 more hours.\n\n---The Bad---\nThe rest of the story is really bad. Or... Well... It is delivered really badly. You are this main character called Haseo, who got PK'ed (Player Killed) on his first day in \"The World\", by the players who learned him the basics. This serves as the tutorial, and it kinda treats you like you are an idiot, who can't remember what they are told. I normally don't have a problem with this in tutorials, but I'll get back to this later.\nAfter this tutorial, you a treated with a cutscene from 8 months later. You learn that Haseo has become a PKK (PK Killer), and is known as the Terror of Death. The reason for this is that during these 8 months he had a friend who got PK'ed by someone called Tri-Edge and ended up in a coma IRL because of it. So basically Haseo is seeking revenge.\nHe finally finds Tri-Edge, who then performs some weird supernatural thing on Haseo, and after that, he is back to level 1. So far, this is fine. It establishes some motivations and end goals.\nAfter this Haseo meets with two new tutorial guys, and they start trying to help him just like before. Haseo tells them that he knows all the shit already, but they don't believe him, so they go with him on a \"quest\". Still no problem. THEN DURING THE FUCKING MISSION, THESE TUTORIAL GUYS TELL HASEO SOMETHING HE DOESN'T FUCKING KNOW! HOW? HOW DOES THIS HAPPENED? HASEO WAS LEVEL 133 OR SOMETHING! HE SHOULD FUCKING KNOW EVERYTHING! HE WAS A FAMOUS PKK, WHO NOBODY COULD BEAT!\n\nOk, ok... It's fine... NO, IT'S FUCKING NOT! This keeps happening during the story. Apparently. Haseo doesn't know about \"The Arena\", a place where official PvP matches take place or most things about guilds (even though he's been in one).\n\nNow you might be saying: \"Don't be stupid baka baka. If they didn't tell Haseo, then how would you, the player, know about all this.\". Yes, that is a valid point, but then why did the game do the \"after 8 months\" cutscene when it did. It could have waited, have you join Haseo first guild, have you join Haseo in his first arena battle because he wanted to get stronger for revenge. Then, after this, we could have had this cutscene. All problems solved.\n\nSadly, this disconnect between what Haseo should know and what he actually knows is not the only problem with this game. Remember what I said about the first tutorial. The entire game is like this. Every time you go into a room and the doors lock, you get: \"You can put in these spheres and then the doors will open.\". Every time Haseo read an email telling him where to go, he then repeats it in his head. THEN WHEN YOU LOG INTO \"THE WORLD\", HE SAIS IT AGAIN! WHY?!?! IM NOT A FUCKING IDIOT! ONE TIME IS ENOUGH! Also, after every major plot point, Haseo will end all cutscenes with: \"Well, I guess I will go check my email or something.\". This happens without exception (this could be a fun drinking game). The problem here is, that you will get a popup when you actually get an email, so there is no reason for him to say it.\n\nOk, so I've deviated a little from the plot, let's get back to that. Haseo get's to know this girl Atoli, who looks exactly like his friend in a coma. This girl seems to kinda fall for him(?) or at least wants his attention really badly. The problem here is, that I really don't see why she cares. Haseo is only ever a jerk to her. He literally bad mouths her guild, the first time they meet. When she then tries to show him what she cares about in \"The World\", like looking at the scenery and taking it easy, he verbally abuses her, tell her to never show her face again. Why does she care for Haseo? Why hasn't she at least blocked him? She probably even has the rights to report him.\n\nBtw, Haseo is also an awfully unlikeable character, if you haven't already noticed. Now, I really don't like to call things \"edgy\", as it is the most uninforming thing people can say as criticism. Sadly, Haseo tries his hardest to be this edgy guy, who cares about no one and always tries to say this \"cool\" and sarcastic lines to whoever he talks to. Sadly, he is never cool, and all his lines sound fucking stupid, especially when he talks to people smarter than him, and gets his word showed back up his ass. He also didn't have any character growths in all the time I played the game. You would think that after his verbal harassment nearly gets Atoli hurt badly (because she does something to get his attention), that he would stop... Sadly, he still just yells at her at the start of volume two, soo... And it's not like he doesn't care for Atoli (I think). It seems to me, that he seems to regret things whenever he actually hurts his friends... That is, when they tell him, that he hurt them. This is especially true for Atoli.\n\nThe dialog in this game is also fucking awful. The English dub is partly to blame, but I assume that they are just reading the subtitles, so even if I had Japanese on, it would still be the same. There is one point where Atoli's voice is kinda weird, and they other people say that they can't hear her. So I assume that this weird voice is to portray her thoughts to me, the player, but NOPE! Everyone responds to her when she talks, and when she tells her guild master about what happened HE LITERALLY SAIS: \"Oooh, so that's why I can't hear you.\". This was where I was about to drop everything. Maybe this is a translation issue, but I can't understand Japanese, so the original script is useless to me.\n\nI think you all get the point by now. If you don't care about the story, or if all this is not a problem, then this may be a game for you. It seems that a lot of people actually enjoy this game, I mean, look at all the positive reviews. I think the premise is strong, and there are some interesting supernatural mysteries that I still want to know the answer to.

I've decided to split the review up slightly between the volumes and it should go without saying there's likely to be some spoilers in this, but I will try to avoid as many major ones I can.\n\nVolumes 1-3 \n\nThe original ps2 games. These games do slightly show their age. They upscale the graphics as much as they can, but they can't exactly upgrade the gameplay, which is a little dated. To be fair however their gameplay was repetitive even back when they were new. The \"jrpg\" curse of being very repetitive is present here but its surprisingly one of the less offensive even in recent memory due to how it is structured. There is also the option now of using what the game calls cheat mode, essentially a \"tell me a story\" difficulty this cuts out all leveling and gear hunting and just lets you experience the story. For anyone else actually interested how the game plays keep reading.\n\nThis game uses scaling to base how its entire system is structured, to put this simply a core statistic (typically your level) is picked by the game to \"weigh\" more than others and has much more bearing on how the other statistics will perform. So in .Hack level is everything. You could have 1 million HP, but if enemy was 20 levels higher than you it'd still kill you in just a few hits. Once you realize this the game will feel a grind at first cause you feel shoehorned into leveling, except G.U. is the extreme end of this scaling so it allows leveling to be abused. The tolerance gap is 10 levels, if you fight anything outside of 10 levels from you the scaling gets extreme and murders you quickly, but if you stay just on the bleeding edge of the 10 levels you gain experience extremely fast and cap out for the respective volume in around just a couple hours each volume if that. That brings me to something else that should be discussed, the volume splits.\n\nBack in the ps2 era these volumes were completely separate games connected solely by the player's save data, one of the larger hopes when they released Re;code would be they connected the games together fully. They did not do this but instead put them all in a sort of emulated launcher which while is not ideal, it works well enough. It also shows the progression of the series very clear as each volume got more added to it, vol 1 feeling very barren. This kinda adds to the pseudo mmo feel as this makes you feel like you're experiencing content updates. Which of course is important to the whole experience of giving you a fake mmo experience.\n\nThis comes to the biggest draw of the games, the pseudo mmo experience and its story. This is the thing that kept me playing despite faults, I loved the story and setting of this series. They go to great lengths to try to make you feel immersed in a fictional breathing world, from other players posting on forums and communicating, to world news posts explaining the issues of this game's \"real\" world. This latter aspect also becomes an interesting time capsule showing what were issues back when the game was made, and can be neat in its own right. The main plot of the games can be a little hard to follow at times as it never truly explains some aspects and leaves it up to the imagination, this is fine so long as you take it simply as that. In all the characters and story to me are the biggest selling point of the game and kept me playing even through its more dull points. \n\nI would have had a very large complaint on them releasing G.U. without the original .hack cause people would be lost story wise if not for one thing, they had the forethought to include the terminal disc from the original ps2 release. The terminal disc was an extra mode that is purely story content that not only explains the original .hack which is handy for people new to the series, it also explains some of the real world happenings leading up to and during G.U.\n\nVol 4 Reconnection\n\nThis will be short as the game itself is pretty dang short, vol 4 can be finished in about 2 hours. This new volume was an extra that came with the re;code repackaging that concludes the G.U. story pretty much definitively. I sort of have a mixed feeling about this, without spoilers there is a bonus ending in vol 3 that acted as the true end at the time, and while it left some things up in the air, I thought it was a decent enough ending. Vol 4's ending and content puts a very bittersweet feeling to how everything ends which I am not sure I like. As for the gameplay there's not much to say as you barely get to play anything and most of the games features are disabled in this volume. The games cut scenes take step forward and step back at the same time by being fully animated yet having some uncanny motion to them, making them feel sort of stop motion.\n\nIts clear to me that they took what they had of the at the time canceled vol 4 and stitched it together so the game could run. The story becomes boarderlne incoherent at points as the \"middle\" that would fill in details is missing, it jumps from main story beat to main story beat till it finishes. In all there's not much to complain about I guess if you think of this simply as an extra to the whole package, but if you were going to get this purely for Reconnection, I'd think about it a bit more.\n\nIn all however the package is great for its price and still a top notch story as long as we leave vol 4 out of the equation.

To those of you who havent played .hack before granted this isnt the best starting point but it should do if you wanna get interested in the series (The original Quadrilogy you cant get anymore but you can probably still watch the anime for it.)\n(Warning I will probably spoil a tiny bit of Volume 4 but only in a gameplay sense)\n\nThe first game of this series Rebirth feels a little bit sluggish from the other 3 games. The story can start off a bit slow and you will be doing a lot of grinding that doesnt feel contributes to the game. That being said if you can get through the first game you will be through most of the slow parts of the game (When I mean slow parts I mean that the story feels like it doesnt progress as well as the other games do.)\n\nThe second game is personally my favourite out of the original GU games because it fixes a lot of problems that the first game had. The new Multi-Trigger system allows you to change weapons on the fly when you use that weapons skill. So say if you wanna switch from Dual Sword to Scythe you can do so while in battle instead of having to change and waiting like a few seconds in battle to switch from the first game. This story will tear you up it probably has the most character development and if you are emotionally attached to characters you will learn a bit more about them.\n\nThe Third game in the series is my second favourite cause it keeps the same formula as all the other games. Haseo grows a lot in personality and learns a lot from every person you have met in the world. This game is probably the game you will be spending the most Post game time on instead of the actual game because there is a LOT to do at the end of this game. Back when I played this I probably spent 10 hours on the main game with 30-40 hours in Post Game. \n\nAnd then we get to Volume 4. Which honestly shouldnt be called its own volume but rather half of a volume with nothing but linear storyline. When you open up Volume 4 EVERYTHING you could do on the desktop you cannot access. When you go through the game you will soon realize that there is no free roam of what you want to do. The game locks you to the story and it feels very iffy. I feel like after all this work I have done in the post game for Volume 3 to only find everything locked it doesnt feel good. However this probably has one of the best endings to the .hack GU franchise and it feels really good at the end. Unfortunately due to what happens once you get to a certain part of the game you cannot use any weapons that you worked up for. It locks you to the one weapon you have to use. It looks cool dont get me wrong but I feel like it feels so bad that all the weapons you worked up for you can never use EVER again.\n\nI havent looked into the Terminal Disc but I checked out the Parody mode and I could not stop laughing watching Parody mode. I would highly recommend checking both of those out but only after you have beat all 4 games.\n\nNonetheless .hack GU despite how Volume 4 locks you in story and theres no post game, .hack GU Last Recode feels like an awesome remaster of the first 3 games and Volume 4 feels like it wrapped up the series very well. If you havent gotten into .hack I HIGHLY recommend playing these games. And hopefully if this gets enough love then maybe I can always hope for a real .hack MMO (Like an actual MMORPG of \"The World\" aside from Fragment.) \n\n(This is my first review so I hope I got my points across very well!)", "timestamp_created": 1512882272, "timestamp_updated": 1512882272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38194333": {"recommendationid": "38194333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044266038", "num_games_owned": 661, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512932632}, "language": "english", "review": "A love letter from my childhood.

Also has data transfer, so if you finish game 1 and use that save for game 2 everything you had carries over.\n\nConclusion: Buy it on sale or after a patch, because unless you're a fan of the saga, 50 bucks (though I got it cheaper) for a game that crashes is not worth it, even though you're actually paying 50 bucks for 4 games.", "timestamp_created": 1512404663, "timestamp_updated": 1512404663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515029", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38044027": {"recommendationid": "38044027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272396310", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1354, "last_played": 1516418987}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved these games on the PS2.

Currently still on Rebirth, so if things change through the series I'm unaware of it. In my opinion, these games individually are worth the single price tag alone still if you are a fan of the series, so 4-in-1 is a great value.\n\nPros:\n-Excellent remastering. The graphics weren't the only thing they touched on and there was clearly a LOT of work that went into this, it wasn't just a nostalgia cash grab.\n-The remastered graphics actually look pretty good. It's not current-gen by any means, but there's times you'll have trouble believing this game is 11 years old.\n-The combat is not quite what I loved from the Quarantine series, but it's still unique and fun and it keeps the player engaged.\n-Tons of content. Like, a lot. The .hack world is so well built, it's a shame The World never made it to a full blown MMORPG spinoff in NA. Plus, this is 4-games in one.\n-The option to either play through the game as it was originally intended, or accelerated with a built-in cheat mode if all you care about is the story. Very nice player comfort feature.\n-Content is not just within the game itself. There's a simulated social hub featuring clips and stories that is actually really well done.\n\nCons\n-Character voice acting is inconsistent. Sometimes it's great, other times it's awful.\n-Not a fan of the generation or combat in this series. The Quarantine series felt a lot more open to me, but it's fair to say there are benefits to this style as well.\n-Game is 11 years old. While this is a proper remaster with a lot of new content, it still suffers from the limitations of 11 year old mechanics.\n-Not releasing a Quarantine remaster before this. Playing the Quarantine series at the very least is helpful to understanding what's going on in the story. If you are new to the series, I'd highly recommend playing the first half of the .hack games first.\n\nHere's to hoping this remastering was intended to help a new team develop a next-gen .hack game.", "timestamp_created": 1512286410, "timestamp_updated": 1512286410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38021261": {"recommendationid": "38021261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198350942044", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512274394}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish i could give this game a solid review, unfortunately it keeps crashing every 15 minutes because of some directx audio file. this isnt an isolated incident, it seems to be an issue for many games", "timestamp_created": 1512270128, "timestamp_updated": 1512270128, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.446097", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38016033": {"recommendationid": "38016033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210458133", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511668275}, "language": "german", "review": "Tolles JRPG aus der PS2 \u00c4ra, dem man aber sein Alter ansieht.\nBesonders bei den kleinen Dungeons und der mangelnden Abwechslung.\nDas alles wird aber durch eine super Story entsch\u00e4digt\n\nPro:\nSehr gute Hauptstory\nTolles Kampfsystem\nAbwechslungsreiche Chars\nLange Spielzeit\n\nContra:\nZu einfach\nzu wenig abwechslung bei den Nebenquests\nzu wenig abwechslung bei den Dungeons", "timestamp_created": 1512251848, "timestamp_updated": 1512251848, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38013915": {"recommendationid": "38013915", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020217450", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 6081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512244982}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u524d3\u90e8\u5c31\u4e0d\u591a\u8aaa\u4e86\n\u4eca\u6b21\u8fce\u4f86\u7b2c4\u7ae0,\u96d6\u7136\u77ed\u4f46\u5c0d\u65bc\u7c89\u7d72\u4f86\u8aaa\u4ecd\u4e0d\u932f\n\u6700\u5f8c\u90a3\u500bo-van\u7d50\u5c40....www\nParody mode\u4e5f\u662f\u5341\u5206\u6709\u8da3\n\u5728\u6b64\u70ba.hack//G.U.\u756b\u4e0a\u53e5\u865f\u3002\n\u9858The World R:X\u6703\u6709\u964d\u81e8steam\u7684\u4e00\u5929", "timestamp_created": 1512245836, "timestamp_updated": 1512245836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38013403": {"recommendationid": "38013403", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978732110", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4667, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512190267}, "language": "english", "review": ".hack//G.U is an amazing series that will make you feel all kinds of emotions.

It won't take too long to beat it when playing just for the main story, boss fights are not really too challenging, but it wouldn't hurt to try and get into the whole \"The World\" setting with logging into your game, interacting with other players via emails and reading outside world news describing the events tied into the story.\n\nGraphics do show that this is a PS2 game, but all the minimal options like resolution, shadows, antialiasing are present.

I finished it in a bit under 2 and half hours.\nInstead of cutscenes, a majority of the story is told through incredibly janky looking anime scenes.  The new form is pretty fun to play as, for the one dungeon you're able to.\n\nMuch, much more enjoyable to play with the graphical improvements and most importantly, 60 fps.  Gameplay, story, and ost (apart from a few very, very repetitive tracks) are all still excellent.  The achievements aren't anything special, you'll get 99% of them from naturally playing the game.  There's no grindy achievements, or \"find this secret!\" types.\n\nThe port is one of the best I've seen of all the jrpgs currently ported.  The title screen is a game selection one, with additional options for the Terminal Disk and Parody Mode (which is amazing)\nI haven't experienced a crash or any sort of slowdown in the 124 hours I have clocked in.  There's some basic quality settings; shadows, anti-aliasing, and texture filtering.  You're able to choose either the english dub or the original japanese voices.\n\nNote that you CAN play this with a keyboard.

The game expects you to know things are important from the original game series as well as .hack // sign and if you are coming in without any background knowledge this game will feel incredibly disjointed and confusing. \n\nI originally avoided picking up g.u. because I thought the idea of Skeith/the other phases being used as fanservice was increidbly irritating. I never liked the idea of something that was supposed to be this terrifying fragment of corrupted data that would data drain humans resulting in them becoming comatose being turned into this \"cool\" anime thing you are supposed to be cheering for when he appears. The worst example of this is the abomination Gorre being turned into a cutesy set of twin robots but that is just my personal gripe with the concept of Avatars. \n\nAfter managing to ignore these issues I enjoyed the games for what they were and had fun. The avatar battles are incredibly easy but there were some satisfying moments in seeing Skeith data draining your nemeses at the end of a battle. Combat overall is done fairly well but the weapons besides the daggers are largely useless unless you want to juggle enemies that are significantly higher than your level. Also, I feel like the dodging ability in part 3 should have been part of the entire series but that is just my opinion. The story has some pacing issues mainly with an obnoxious pink dog-eared warlock wanting you to do side quests randomly but other than that was well written and enjoyable. \n\nThe games get gradually better as they go along with the exception of the added part 4 so if (when) you find yourself trodding through the seemingly endless trivial and almost insulting objectives in part 1 do know that the games do eventually pick up. \n\nAnd sort of spoiler warning but I do sincerely hope that what Piros says at the end of part 4 turns out to be true and not just in-game chatter.", "timestamp_created": 1511887040, "timestamp_updated": 1511887155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37878261": {"recommendationid": "37878261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043350568", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511648204}, "language": "english", "review": "Never played the origonal PS2 Games and picked this up due to recommendations from friends.

The side quests can be tedious and take a long time if you want to go for 100% completion with weapons/armor/accessories/items lists, especially since some side quests from Vol1 are repeated exactly in Vol2 and Vol3.

Last Recode es una compilaci\u00f3n remasterizada de tres de videojuegos de esta emblem\u00e1tica serie JRPG lanzada originalmente para PS2. El lanzamiento del recopilatorio presenta una resoluci\u00f3n de hasta 4K, as\u00ed como otras mejoras gr\u00e1ficas y ajustes jugables. A su vez, incluye una secuela a su tetralog\u00eda original, conformada por Rebirth, Reminisce y Redemption. \n\nThe World es donde transcurren los hechos de estas entregas, un juego MMO no real dentro del t\u00edtulo, recordemos que es de la \u00e9poca de la aclamada PS2, la cual no contaba con semejante potencia.\nEn este t\u00edtulo encarnamos a Haseo, un sujeto que debido a un altercado al comienzo del primer volumen se convierte en una maquina extremadamente poderosa de asesinar jugadores que se dedican a eliminar a otros jugadores dentro de The World, los conocidos Player Killers o PK. Pero debido a un enemigo conocido como Tri-Edge su poder se ve reducido a Nivel 1 y a partir de aqu\u00ed comienza la aventura. \n\nPosee una trama muy bien creada y narrada; realmente buena y muy madura. Tiene adem\u00e1s una gran cantidad de contenido y escenas estilo anime. Estas remasterizaciones traen muchas mejoras, e incluyen el cap\u00edtulo in\u00e9dito Reconnection. \n\nDado a la \u00e9poca en la cual fue originalmente creado, cada volumen tiene corta duraci\u00f3n, pero entre todos puede darte m\u00ednimo unas 70 horas de juego. Otro punto en contra es que, nueva mente por la edad del original, el combate puede resultar un tanto antiguo, anticuado; pero no es injugable.\n\nRealmente una muy buena jugada por parte de Bandai Namco; si bien no es su serie m\u00e1s famosa la saga .hack goza del apoyo por parte de muchos jugadores quienes jugaron originalmente a estos t\u00edtulos. Es una vuelta al pasado y a la juventud de muchos veteranos en los videojuegos, que da la posibilidad de recordar viejas tardes luego de la escuela jugando a la consola o noches enteras de verano tratando de superar alg\u00fan jefe o mazmorra.

Anyway, I always hoped the series would get a new game over the years but to have a sort of remastered version along with a brand new chapter was enough to me for now!\n\nOverall they made some quality of life changes making some small things go faster/easier with this new version but I don't feel like that negatively affected my gameplay. \n\nThe combat is fairily simple and to today's standards it feels old but it's not necessarily bad. I personally didn't have a problem with it when playing in the PS2 neither have any problems playing now. But if you end up not enjoying it you probably won't like the rest of the battles through the game because it basically feels the same thing even with the different weapon styles.\n\nWithout mentioning much spoilers the story feels a bit cliche at first like it's just a revenge tale but it grows to something deeper and the characters has some pretty good development too which did stood out for me as I played. \n\nThe music was very well done and it has some fantastic themes but I felt it sometimes was a bit repetitive if you're grinding areas for exp or items or even sidequests objectives. Like the same field songs playing over and over as you run through the zones.\n\nWhich brings me to the map variety, it's not great at all, while there are a LOT of possible zones combinations with the keyword system they dont bring too much variety aside just level gaps, so that may be a problem for some. \n\nIt's far from a perfect game but even despite the flaws it still is a fantastic JRPG and I'm very happy it got a new edition.

So I was ecstatic when it came to Steam and I could finally give it a shot. Unfortunately, I don't think it is an improvement in any way over the original IMOQ series. \n\nI cannot recommend this game to anyone who hasn't already played any other .hacks and enjoyed them enough to want to continue to build upon the story and atmosphere in the .hack universe.\n\nThe combat has taken an enormous step back with it now being battles that are sectioned off and cannot be escaped without an item. Not only that, but it's almost always a group of 3 enemies, or a single \"hard\" enemy that gets quite repetitive.\n\nAreas have also changed for the worse. Instead of having open fields to run in with a dungeon somewhere within each landscape, now everything has a dungeon-like layout to it that has very little variation.\n\nData drain is now a very tedious mini-game that you are forced to play which always, every single time throughout the entire series, starts off without a brief tutorial message. It's really disheartening to think your audience is so incapable of performing a task you've forced them into doing 30+ times by the end of the series, and still think they don't know how to attack and dodge.\n\nA new resource has been added to the game, probably to make up for lack of grunties and hunting for grunty food called Chim Chims. These creatures serve absolutely no purpose but to make you wait to progress. In order to collect chims, there are various ways to get them, but the most common is sitting next to a switch and waiting for some to come out and flipping the switch to knock them off tracks. These are always included next to the doors that Chim Chims open, so I cannot see any purpose they serve but to inhibit progress.\n\nThis game's narrative really tasks you with suspending your disbelief pretty early on, but by the 3rd game I felt so unimmersed by how high stakes the game becomes with seemingly no reason other than to \"go bigger\". The story trips upon itself multiple times by the very end by plotholes and how frequently the game moves it's own goalpost.\n\nThe addition of a new episode, Reconnection (vol. 4), is the most redeeming thing about Last Recode. Its story tones it down and makes it personal again. The cutscenes use a more traditional anime style that is absolutely gorgeous. The game has a good amount of closure that vol. 3 didn't really provide in the original G.U. trilogy. \n\nI can really only recommend this game to anyone who played the G.U. trilogy, but not the additional episode Reconnection, even on a sale.\n\nHere's to hoping they remaster the Infection/Mutation/Outbreak/Quarantine series.", "timestamp_created": 1511735842, "timestamp_updated": 1511736059, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.413911", "comment_count": "120", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37721297": {"recommendationid": "37721297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010582684", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510474119}, "language": "english", "review": "As of the time of my reviewing this, I have 58.5 hours in the game, for the first volume alone, out of four volumes.

Packaged with it was .hack G.U/ Rebirth. I played so much of that game, and the games that followed, and the G.U. series has been my favorite ever since. So I might be a little bias as I write this.\n\n.hack has always been known for its dramatic stories that stray a little close to the melodramatic. G.U. is no different, but its loveingly crafted from start to finish. Haseo, as your playable protagonist, grows into being a hero (thank god, he's a bit of an ass in the beginning) and your supporting cast is full of great personalities. You'll have a hard time deciding on who to bring with you every time you venture out. \n\nThe updated version released onto the PC is pretty stable, though I did notice that there are times were it will start dropping frames. A quick restart of the game fixes that, and you'll want to play it on the highest settings to see the updated graphics package, though just about any computer can run it. Experience is easy to gain now. You don't have to grind the same area words over and over again, and for those that just want to experience the story, there is cheat mode, which is basically an insta win setting for combat encounters. \n\nIf you are looking for a solid JRPG with a lot to offer, look no further. You can't argue with the value of the package (4 games for $49.99, each around 15-20 hours long without attempting to 100% each game). Save data carries over from volume to volume, so that awesome piece of armor you picked up from God Eater at the end of vol. 2? Still on you when you start vol. 3 with some added goodies. \n\nIt's good shit.

Entirely too long cutscenes, strange plot pacing, obscenely huge monsters with questional shapes.\n\nOver 4 games you'll get to toy with 5 different types of weapons. One thing Last recode absoutely nails is making each weapon feel different. THe dual swords feel fast and fluid, chaining huge combos with satisfying speed. THe broadsword feels like you're hitting someone with a truck. Somehow, the .//hack team made scythe combat interesting. Wide, sweeping arc attacks make you feel like a true grim reaper. And Dual guns let you chain combos and juggle enemies in mid air as only a JRPG could think to try.\n\nThe short but welcome new addition of Volume 4 creates this weird chain sword which behaves like nothing I've ever seen. But it also feels satisfying to use. \n\nLike I said in the intro, the pacing is garbage. In volume 1, you hit a grind that just doesn't seem to stop, then you end the grind, kill 2 bosses, and the volume is done. Volume 3 feels short, and volume 4 IS short. Characters don't always act like reasonable people. Or act their age (seriously, Sakaki is supposed to be 12. Haseo is supposed to be 17. Ovan is supposed to be 25. Yata is supposed to be about 15.) Atoli's voice acting is shrill. Gaspard's voice is infamous among the .//hack fans. the native japanese voice acting is here, if you can't get over the English voices. \n\nOverall, as a package, you're going to get over 100 hours of content. If you're a completionist, most likely 110 to 120.

My biggest concern when buying this was the PC port. It being a PS2 Era, it should not be that hard to update it and make it run better. But at the same time, the port could be handled poorly and run like crap. \n\nI am here to report that the port of the game is functional, smooth, and feels amazing to play. That is Mainly what I based my recommend on. Of course, if you haven\u2019t played a .hack game or even know the .hack series, I\u2019ll fill you in on this extensive review.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n.hack takes place in a pretty unique setting in a faux MMORPG game \u2018The World\u2019 which has been affected by internet phenomena out of bounds of the current game. The story of this game takes place after the events of an anime called .hack Roots. There a references to characters from that anime that appear in this game that you would have no context for if you didn\u2019t watch the anime. This may bug some people. The game does a good enough job of explaining the events prior to the game through cutscenes referencing the main characters. There are also some tidbits and references through forum posts. There should be enough here to get the story without watching Roots, but the presence of some unexplained relationships can be off putting.\n\nYou follow a character by the name of Haseo, who is essentially your rpg edgelord. You start the story with essentially the very beginning of the.hack Roots anime. Two characters approach you with the pretense of teaching you the game. Then essentially comes the Tutorial, then the beginning of a big cutscene reel. The two characters that invited you are Player Killers (PKers) and do what they do best to you. While bullying you, the two get owned by the BEST character in the game. After that and the whole cutscene spiel, you essentially start again, and follow Haseo on his misadventure of gaining power, learning of the special characters called Epitath Users, and battling a virus hitting the world called AIDA. \n\nThe story doesn\u2019t really start taking off until Volume 2. But there is still enough in Volume 1, if maybe with not as many big plot points and crazy happenings that follow the world. The Characters you encounter along the way are all pretty likable, with perhaps the exception of the main character at least through most of Volume 1. Point is, the story is good, but there are little rivets here and there that can make it a little bit slow or cringy. Stick with it though, because Volume 2 on gets considerably better.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe loop of gameplay here is essentially, go read email, go do task in email, and then log out, and read email again. The loop is broken up often through world building like reading forum posts, doing optional quests, and playing special campaigns through the game that are offered. You may also break up the loop by going to grind. This is a pretty level driven game, equipment and levels can really make or break you sometimes.\n\nSpeaking of that, the game can either be easy if you use all the systems the game has in place or challenging if you do not. It is not impossible to beat the game without using everything, but being well prepared will always lend an easier time. Upgrading your and your party members equipment will show favorable results. Not doing that you may find yourself lacking some firepower. That said, there are a ton of party members in this game, so keeping them all updated is a bit hard. Pick your favorites and keep them fleshed out while the rest kinda just are there.\n\nCombat in this game is simple but very fun. You have a basic combo, with a finisher depending on the weapon equipped. You have a charge attack. You have 4 skill slots you can easily activate, and you can also cast some magic skills if you want. You have access to more weapons the further you go in, with one per volume. There is also the Avatar Battles, which are nice break from the normal combat. You have a shot, a slash, and a dash and the battles all have some unique attacks and patterns to watch for. Really, this is probably the strongest part of the game for me.\n\n[h1]Look & Feel[/h1]\n60FPS smooth through most of the game, with some slowdowns with particularly particle heavy things, like awakenings, and some scenes. Though they also are a bit to conveniently placed and it almost feels like cinematic effect. Outside of that, it's silky smooth and fast to play. It feels really good.\n\nLooks can be spotty, Textures and models are updated, but textures still look a little icky up close. Not only that, but there is an awful lot of texture clipping, especially with character models and different floor looks. I\u2019ll often seen little jittery black likes of pixels in scenes as someone's foot clips through their cape or their hand through their armor. It doesn\u2019t look \u2018bad\u2019 but it is a place that could have been improved to look even better. \n\n[h1]Other Stuff[/h1]\nAll the little extras and improvements that come with this game are nice. Ability to use items consecutively outside of combat. Faster leveling and weapon leveling. Faster paced battles with your higher damage output. It just makes the game all the better with all these little improvements. They did this in game, where in Volume 2 there were lots of changes that just made the game better present from the very get go. \n\nAll these little things make the game worth buying, it is 4 games in 1, with good improvements and additions that just polish it up a little. There are certainly some things I would have liked changed (like the requirements for the campaigns and book of 1000 are still really high) but it is overall a nice touch here and there.\n\nTo wrap it up\nThis game is fairly priced for what it is. If you played these games and want to relive them, this is the best way to do it now. If you are new to .Hack, you may be lost, but I think the game stands well enough on its own. If you are not a fan of RPGS driven by story, avoid this. This hits a very small niche of people, and this is a very japanese game.

This makes the whole thing seem very rushed as you get from point to point to point through all the games. If you like story driven games, having that feeling of 'hurry and get to the next point' diminishes the enjoyment of the story by a  great margin.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Absolutely.

I played it tons on my PS2. I'd already played it so much that I could recite entire scenes without paying attention to it. I no longer had a PS2 and had one of the early PS3s that actually had backwards compatibility, but mine was one of those that needed updates first before a new PS2 game could be played, so when Redemption came out I actually had to wait a while before I could play it. I could list many faults with these games, but even despite those flaws, I would still rate them really highly, at least a 9/10. \n\nBut I can't really say the same about the remaster. It's still the fun game series, and the games themselves havn't changed much, but while the remaster has introduced some great changes, it also introduces some negatives as well. There are more than enough reviews that gush about the remaster, but I want to note it's downsides. Even with the things I dislike about this master in mind, I still recommend this game though, especially if you were already a fan.\n\nAlso, I have not reached Vol. 4 yet. Just to let you guys know, but it should be irrelevant as my issues are with general changes to all of these games, and not really the story as that was left unchanged. Basically this review is not about the game itself, but the remaster.\n\n\n\nI'm not one to garner interest by saving my most important point for last, it's going to be my first point, and that is the difficulty. In this remaster, they made it easier by giving you more EXP, and having you deal more damage, along with a bit of a faster combat speed. When I initially heard of these changes, I already didn't like them, but thought they were just tiny details I could just shrug off, not realizing how big they actually change things. It's much easier, even with the original game's lax difficulty in mind. You'll already feel like you're overleveled by just doing the main quests, but if you decide to go do some side quests, or even just some random field hopping, you're going to make the game way too easy. In the old games it was either too difficult because you were underleveled, or too easy because you grinded, but here you are not given that choice, it's just too easy. This leads to battles not being nearly as satisfying, and that's my biggest problem with this.\n\nWith the enhanced EXP and enhanced damage comes another issue, and that is GP, the game's currency. Unlike EXP, the amount you get was untouched. If you want to get some GP by fighting some battles, you're going to become easily overleveled, meaning to get GP you're forced to use methods that don't involve gaining EXP. This is less of an important note as the easiest and best ways to gain GP were not by battles, but it's still enough for me to consider it a negative.\n\nThe graphics are definitely improved, but it to me is both a negative and a positive. It definitely looks nicer, that's a good thing, the problem is the animation. In just normal cutscenes, the characters mouths don't move. It's not really anyone's fault, this was a PS2 game, but having graphics that are far more than the PS2's graphics actually really makes you notice this small nitpick of a detail to the point where it's actually kind of jarring. \n\nMany remasters try to just bring an old series up to today's standards with enhanced graphics and quality of life upgrades while trying it's best to keep the original game's experience as close as possible, but this remaster is less like those remasters. It isn't really here to preserve the experience you had with the original trilogy, but is more here to just introduce new players into the series, while also giving old and new players alike a new 4th game. There's nothing inherently wrong with this at all, it's just something worth noting to temper expectations for those that wanted to experience Vol. 1 through 3 like they did from the PS2 era while getting some updates to bring it up to more modern standards.\n\nThese are the issues I found with the remaster. Not to say there are no positives, in fact if the remasters were actually bad, I wouldn't actually put this as a recommended title. There are far more than enough forum posts and reviews talking about why this game is worth it, while I felt like there weren't enough talking about the issues with this. \n\nI know some of you are going to be baffled at this, a review that basically talks about all the negatives and skips all the positives of a game, while at the same time telling you that I do in fact recommend this game, and that's completely rational, in fact it'd be weirder if you weren't wondering why. This review isn't here to deter anyone from buying the game, in fact it isn't even here to convince people to buy it, the reason why I made this was because I want people to temper expectations when it comes to this remaster. \n\n\n\nTL;DR original Trilogy's difficulty changes affect more than you initially think it will. If you want a pristine, but slightly updated experience with Volumes 1 through 3 before you move on to the new Volume 4, then you might be a tiny bit disappointed.

Plotholes show up if you dare to look up how this relates to any of the other series in dot hack. The story and characters will sometimes rely on tropes and archetypes and turn into melodrama a few too many times. Gameplay can get monotonous at times and collecting chims, symbols, etc can ruin the pacing of a dungeon.\n\nI recognize this game has a lot of problems that don't make it an amazing game. And yet, I absolutely adore this game\n\nI'm going to own up to my bias here, I played this as a teenager but never finished it back on the ps2 days. I never knew all that happened but I got far enough that I was captivated by the world. Art design, atmosphere, world building, and the feel of it all is so sublime that I have trouble properly wording it.\nWhile the design can get ludicrous at times, it's such a varied and unique style that I've never encountered another game that has produced this weird combination of celtic/germanic fantasy and japanese style. The music hits you the best with this combination as you'll be quick to notice that it loves the german language to induce a very nice mysterious atmosphere at key moments. The cinematics also show off how this is when CyberConnect2 really started to embrace their insane animation style. It is a an absolute joy to watch and it sucks there aren't more hand animated cutscenes. Finally, the changes they made really fized the pacing of these games. Each game back in the day took 20+ hours and now the whole series has been condensed with each part being a nice 10-15 hour experience. It really is the first series (dot hack in general not G.U.) that popularized the idea of making a story take place in a real game, and G.U. is the best the series has to offer.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, but I am begging you to give it a chance, If you don't like it, that is completely fine, but I see so much potential for this series and I hope more people can see why I love it.", "timestamp_created": 1511594735, "timestamp_updated": 1511594735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37472008": {"recommendationid": "37472008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041542759", "num_games_owned": 461, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512187515}, "language": "english", "review": "Story rich action RPG from my childhood.\n\nI recommend because:\nof the interesting and immersive world.\nmost of the cast eventually develop into satisfying characters.\nbesides the main story there are diverse side quests.\n\nOn the other hand, some people may find the game repetitive and the cutscenes may be painful if you're not into the story.

That said this game comes with all 3 volume's for the .Hack//G.U. trilogy with an extended volume 4 that adds a liner 3 hour or so expansion onto the story of the trilogy that overall helped finalise and gave a satisfying conclusion to this 100 hour or so story of a MMORPG that is a single player game..... Huh.\n\nSome great things that this game does is that the overall story and characters are all interesting with some that you will love while some you will hate (won't say any names) that will make you keep coming back to see what happens in this game. Speaking of game the gameplay itself seems to improve as you go through the volumes with new battle techniques  being introduced as the volumes go on and for the most part the combat is fun and has a very 'tales of' action feel to it but just not as refined. \n\nHowever some things must be made apparent when dealing with .Hack//G.U. Last Recode as there are some cons I personally found with the game, the first thing is the keyboard control scheme seriously F.......k this default setup it is absolutely horrible and it doesn't help that the game's tutorial has only the Xbox controller prompts in the game so good luck finding out what A, X, B, Y, LB, LT ext. are because the game won't tell you that. But to be fair you can change the assigned key's in the options so that's a minor complaint I\u2019m just warning anyone that plays this with a keyboard to find your own set-up like I had to. \n\nA final minor complaint is that while gameplay is fun for the most part there is a lot of grinding to do if you want get 100% in this game mainly with the side quests that are not only repeated across all the volumes but can be very annoying to say the least to complete. I mean the amount of times I had to kick Chim Chim's, save Mecha Grunty, hunt down Pk'ers, talk to people to hand out flyer's and kick mystic animals (please don't call PETA on me) are repeated throughout all of volume's 1 to 3, but you can ignore them if you want to.\n\nI know this review may make it seem my experience with the game was repetitive and you could be right to an extent but honestly it does have a lot of fun moments and the story and characters are really good and I don't want to say anymore with the fear of spoiler's. For people who have never played it and are interested in .Hack//G.U. and I do highly recommend this game to newcomer's into the .Hack series as there is a lot of content to enjoy. However to those that have played the trilogy on your PS2 I personally would not recommend this to you, as from what I saw their really isn't anything new for you except vol 4 and a few updated cutscenes with better graphics but even then it doesn't justify a full price buy. So maybe wait for the price to come down and pick it up during a sale, overall anyone that is interested in story-rich games you will like what get here and this is a game that must be played.", "timestamp_created": 1511588079, "timestamp_updated": 1511600349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37465650": {"recommendationid": "37465650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126483254", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "last_played": 1515732058}, "language": "english", "review": "Back between the ps2 and ps3 era, I bought these game series during a break from college, and played them all to ALMOST 100% I was thinking fo going back and replaying the series, just when I was going to see if the old PS2 still at my parents home worked, the announce the remaster and an additional chapter.

Nat\u00fcrlich werden Leute die den Anime bereits gesehen haben, einen st\u00e4rkeren Effekt genie\u00dfen als die, die einfach nur mal ein .Hack-RPG ausprobieren wollten. Es ist zwar keine Pflicht den Anime zu schauen, da gen\u00fcgend R\u00fcckblenden und Erkl\u00e4rungen vorhanden sind, aber es ist trotzdem empfehlenswert. Die ersten paar Teile waren sehr langsam, und in jedem davon gibt es einen Arena-Abschnitt, welcher eine gute Abwechslung zum Monster-Gemetzel ist. Der dritte Teil aber hat mich vollends daran erinnert, warum ich einer der weniger Personen bin, welche \u00fcber 18 ist und .Hack dem Anime SAO vorzieht - In jeglicher Hinsicht. Die Geschichte ist einfach brilliant, und hat sehr sch\u00f6ne Mindfuck stellen.\n\nDas Gameplay(Kampf): Ist sehr von den alten .Hack Teilen abgeschieden. Es basiert mehr auf Action und Reaktion, als auf Taktik. F\u00fcr die Einen mag das ganz gut sein, f\u00fcr die Anderen eher nervig. Zu viele Gegner mit einem Stunlock, und einem ziemlich h\u00e4sslichen Geschrei, wenn sie Dich in der Luft \u00fcber 3 Sekunden fliegen lassen, w\u00e4hrend Du nichts dagegen tun kannst. Daf\u00fcr aber machen Feinde Spa\u00df, welche viel HP haben, aber das klassische: Tank, Heiler DPS-Prinzip bieten. Meistens m\u00fcsst Ihr damit rechnen, den Boss zu tanken, w\u00e4hrend ihr Atoli zum Beispiel heilen l\u00e4sst. Das Spiel will eine Simulation eines MMOs sein, und macht viele Dinge richtig. Aber um ehrlich zu sein, hatte ich diese Immersion nur zu Beginn des Spiels. Nach Vol. 1 nie wieder. Lediglich die ganzen Anspielungen von G.U erinnerten mich daran, dass es sich hierbei um ein Online-Spiel handelt. \n\nZudem sind die Gebiete recht unterschiedlich und ansehlich. Es herrscht sogar der Drang das Gebiet komplett zu erkunden, um noch ein Ausr\u00fcstungsteil zu bekommen, welches vielleicht eine bessere Eigenschaft besitzt. \n\nAudio(Musik und Synchro): Sehr angenehm. W\u00e4hrend Du die Story verfolgt, tauchen hin und wieder sogar Vocals auf, die sehr sch\u00f6n und japanisch klingen. Die Musik passt sich sehr gut der Umgebung an, sprich: Nachts eher leise und ruhiger, Tags \u00fcber lieblich usw. Die Synchro ist auch sehr gut gelungen. Atoli's Stimme finde ich pers\u00f6nlich sehr sch\u00f6n, auch wenn sie zu Beginn eher wie ein dummes Kind wirkt, was durch Ihre Vergangenheit aber Sinn macht, sollte man sich mehr mit den Charakteren befassen. \n\nPC-Port: Naja... Es geht. Ich hatte keine Ruckler, aber haufenweise Slow-Motion Effekte, die sicher ungewollt waren. Die Einstellungen der Optionen ist auch nicht wirklich gut, und der Support der Entwickler ist kaum vorhanden. Abst\u00fcrze gab es meinerseits auch ein paar, aber seit kurzem nicht mehr. (Anscheinend wurde das behoben, obwohl ich keinen Download gesehen habe)\n\nFazit: Das Spiel wird dem niedrigen Metacritic-Score nicht gerecht. Es hat H\u00f6hen und Tiefen, aber es gibt kaum ein vergleichbares RPG auf dem Markt, welches sich f\u00fcr einen Vergleich anbieten k\u00f6nnte. Es w\u00e4re toll gewesen, wenn das Spiel einen Koop-Modus gehabt h\u00e4tte, mit schwierigen Gebieten dessen W\u00f6rter man in der Kampanie freischalten muss, mit einem netten Endboss als Kirsche.", "timestamp_created": 1511542085, "timestamp_updated": 1511542085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37345011": {"recommendationid": "37345011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068374204", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511532439}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the ending this game deserved, finally we get to see the closure of the main arc after all these years.\nThe dungeons sometimes feel like a chore, but it's worth in the end.", "timestamp_created": 1511533929, "timestamp_updated": 1511533929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37344564": {"recommendationid": "37344564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047703458", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 896, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511533731}, "language": "english", "review": "SAO without SAO", "timestamp_created": 1511533805, "timestamp_updated": 1511533805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505523", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37329391": {"recommendationid": "37329391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077242165", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512223527}, "language": "english", "review": "Well time to write a real one.\nPlaying with Laptop, and boy it's not the best laptop in market.

I'm not going to talk about any of the story but it would be best to go into the game with absolutely no information except that this game predicted the future of mankind on multiple occasions.\n\nWhat I can tell you is that the gameplay is very well pased as monsters attack but the single button combat for you may be a downer to some people if they're coming from games with a lot more to the combat system. You can't forget that the original .hack gu came out 11 years ago. From combat to game mechanics this game offers SOOOOOO much more than with normal mmos and games. Todays games still take certain aspects from the .hack series and input these ideas into their games with a small modern twists, still creating inspiration' reminding people that this game series still stands to perfection time after time. Warp gates, Bike for fast movement, Weapon and armor grinding, CRIMSON VS, Goblin racing, Side quests, Post game after play and forums. \n\nThe Soundtrack is God Tier and the people who made it deserve an award just in that one part of the game.

It is well and truly one of my favorite games of all time, one that I find is still dear to my heart after all these years. It is important to me in a way that few other games are - just because of the characters, who I resonated with on a personal level. The cast defies description, and I'd say, \"just play the game yourself to see what they're like\".\n(To say that I was euphoric about the remaster would be an understatement. I have been annoying everyone I know about this game ever since I heard the news.)\n\nThat being said, as someone who played through the PS2 games entirely too much, I do have some qualms with this port. While I haven't experienced any of the legendary crashing issues, I have had framerate problems (though this may just be due to my admittedly lacking computer). Also, for those who are returning to the game from playing through it originally, there are some interface changes that may be confusing at first - in particular, the tab colors for \"offline\" and \"online\" party members have been switched, which still sort of disorients me.\n\nAll-in-all, though, I would still very much recommend this remaster. It's personal bias, but I still love this game with all of my heart, and the remaster, while flawed, has done it justice in my opinion.\n\n\"Welcome to 'The World'.\"", "timestamp_created": 1511449483, "timestamp_updated": 1511449839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37083062": {"recommendationid": "37083062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058117938", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512881707}, "language": "english", "review": "The .hack// series was one of my first video games that I truly loved.

But nostalgia doesn't always mean something is actually good. I still love it nonetheless. \nThe game is highly story-driven and has an amazing soundtrack. But, with the remake they brought rebalancing and subsequently made the game too easy majority of the time. Avatar battles are still annoying tho. There is no point to the \"cheat mode\"  they added, its that easy normally.\nAs a game originally made for PS2 this port is fairly broken and clearly not optimized very well for PCs. Although there are many people who can run the game with out a hitch there are also many who have encountered a ton of problems with crashes and frame rate drops. (even some on high spec computers). Even when you can run the game fine, there are a lot of visual glitches I have encountered. \nYou should expect to play this game with a controller as very little effort was made to make keyboard and mouse work for this game. The mouse pretty much has no function at all and the keyboard default binds make almost no sense. You must configure your controller through steam settings and they messed up with the binds for the d-pad so you'll probably have to go in a fix that but people have posted threads on the community forums to aid in that.\nAlso, as an HD \"remaster\",  the character models still look very clunky and the graphics are still very dated looking. It seems all they really did other than make it run at 60 fps and on higher resolution screens, is make the textures on models a little clearer. Definitely not on the same level as the remaster of the Kingdom Hearts games. But KH looked a lot better to begin with anyway. \nI am also fairly disappointed that they did not update pretty much any of the desktop wallpapers in the game to 1080p resolution, they just added an image border around the original image to make it fill out 1920x1080.\nHowever, despite my complaints,  the games DO get better as you progress through the volumes, and although the game play is a little lacking, and the cut scene can sometimes really drag on for what feels like forever. Im really in it for the story, and I highly recommend the game and watching the related animes as well.

Enjoying this with my dad was such a big part of my childhood, and I am SOOOO excited to get back into it.\n\nAs I have put a few hours into it already, I can say for certain it feels exactly like it used to (with better graphics of course).\n\nPROS:\n-Updated graphics, much smoother and more pleasing than the originals.\n-Soundtrack is phenominal, and most of the time it feels like it belongs in an actual MMORPG.\n-While it can take some time to get used to, the main combat system is pretty tight, and knocking around enemies with big-ass weapons feels awesome.\n-The important boss battles still feel very grand and spectacular.\n-Loads and saves MUCH faster than it did on PS2, and runs very smoothly.\n-Still feels immersive, even when not in the actual game. When not in \"The World\", the rest of the game exists on the computer desktop of the player behind the Haseo character. In a way, you effectively ARE that person.\n\nCONS:\n-Voice acting, as could be expected from the PS2 era, is rather cringy pretty often.\n-As others have stated, the gameplay is pretty repetitive and linear. The 3rd game in the series did a bit better in this regard.\n-The early hours of each game feel very limiting.\n-Fairly low challenge (at least in Vol. 1), as the EXP grind was tuned down more than I thought.\n\nGreat JRPG, more enjoyable than most in my opinion. It has some faults but most of them come in the form of voice acting and (sometimes) low difficulty.

I was a fan of the original .hack games, and surprisingly hadnt even heard GU existed until maybe a year ago so it was a \"Duh\" purchase the moment this was released.\n\nWould I recommend this, even for non fans of the series? Definitely. Buy it. Now. Or wait for a sale, buy it twice, and gift the copy to someone. K, Its not THAT amazing, but I liked it alot. In comparison to the original 4, I feel that the story is much more involved and overall better, but as far a gameplay mechanics go I think they dropped the ball in a few spots:\n\n1. Combat system is much more fluid. Thats a bonus, but as you progress through the volumes you get different forms that allow you to use more weapons. By the time I got to the end of 2 and around the middle of 3 I realized its almost pointless to use anything other than dual swords as your primary weapon. Everything else is just slow, until Xth.\n\n2. There is a victory scene after every regular fight that you cannot skip. They build up your annoyance after playing the game for hours on end trying to grind to a certain level. The only way to avoid that is to get to volume 3, which by then its probably been over 40 hours...little late.\n\n3. Combat difficulty is...low. At the start of every volume, if you level up 10-20 levels (and that doesnt take long), literally the rest of the volume is a cakewalk. Basically enemies below a certain threshold simply dont do damage to you, and your damage counter ramps up to 9999 just to show you how OP you are for that current area.\n\n4. AI of party members is borderline mentally handicapped. Its been a while since I played the original 4, but it felt like you could tell your members what to do with a little more detail. In GU theres only 4 commands, and healing is the one I had the most issue with. You set a party member to heal and they about vanish from the battlefield and blow through their magic just to heal you for every speck of dirt that damages you, yet ignore people who die.\n\n5. Activating story progression is the most tedious thing you will ever do. The game forces you to check your email for one message, to then have you log back in, change servers, warp to some 3 to 4 layer dungeon that you have to go to the end to for a 20 second cutscene that has -86% impact on anything, to then repeat it all for actual progression...\n\n6. Status ailments arent so well defined as they were in the first 4. I didnt care enough to look it up, or pay close attention if it tells you in game, but I still have no idea what curse does. They also dont seem to affect enemies very much but will just about annihilate you without proper armor effects/items.\n\nI can give all of those a pass for the most part considering the game's age, the reason I consider them cons is because I'm comparing them too much to modern games. Playing through these was a fun time killer, especially for a branch of the series I hadnt actually played before. There is an anime that is a prelude to this, which I have yet to watch. You wont be lost if you dont watch it, but it will explain a few key parts.\n\nIts interesting to note that in Vol. 4 Reconnection, Piros lets slip that a new version of the world is coming. After realizing that Piros wasn't mandatory to talk to like the other party members and therefore easy to miss, along with the fact that Vol. 4 is brand new, It would be fun to imagine a modern entry to \"The World\" at some point in the future.", "timestamp_created": 1511151231, "timestamp_updated": 1511151231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36632983": {"recommendationid": "36632983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262546771", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 18450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 698, "last_played": 1516454954}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly one of the best games ive played if you have played the previous 4\n", "timestamp_created": 1511124553, "timestamp_updated": 1511124553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36627413": {"recommendationid": "36627413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176397979", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513411978}, "language": "schinese", "review": "PS2\u672b\u671f\u795e\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e74\u8f7b\u70b9\u7684\u5927\u591a\u56e0\u4e3a\u5200\u5251\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u8001\u73a9\u5bb6\u773c\u91cc\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u65e0\u7591\u662f\u65e0\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3\u7684\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u6027\u53ca\u97f3\u4e50\u4e0a\u505a\u7684\u76f8\u5f53\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u76f8\u5f53\u503c\u5f97\u4e00\u73a9\uff0c\u8865\u7968\u91cd\u6e29\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1511109100, "timestamp_updated": 1511109100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36623823": {"recommendationid": "36623823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041150422", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511242697}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to actually be able to play the game.

To newcomers, I recommend reading (or play the original .hack video game) the first full series to better understand Kite's role.

Small touches like the using the main character's desktop, watching newsreels or reading posts was really immersive and unique.\n\nCon: This game has a extremely repetive formula which it vehemently sticks to. Here's what it looks like: Watch a Cutscene, Go speak to someone, Go on a quest with that person, Finish that quest and they tell you something, Log out of game and check your email. Rinse wash repeat.\n\nHonestly I've enjoyed the game but I think $30 is a bettter price, I say this because there isn't much to game it's self beyond the story and it can feel a bit repetitive.

Gives game a repetitive feel at times.\n- Although fun, combat isn't very mechanically deep, challenging or well balanced. Didn't die or come close to dying once.\n\nMixed:\n-/+ Apart from a few standouts, music is servicable but unmemorable\n-/+ Levelling is kind of fast.

Teile zu zocken. Dementsprechend habe ich es nicht erwarten k\u00f6nnen, mich hieran versuchen zu k\u00f6nnen!\n\nPositiv: \n- STORY!\nDas wird immer einer der st\u00e4rksten Punkte in .hack sein. Die Story hat alles, was man sich w\u00fcnschen kann: Drama, ein paar gute Lache, interessante Charaktere. Ich hatte am Anfang bedenken, da das Spiel sowohl ohne Kite, als auch ohne Black Rose und andere bekannte Charaktere aus den ersten Teilen auskommt. Zumindest als wirklich relevante Story Charaktere. Ich bin jetzt im zweiten Game und fand den Storyverlauf wirklich super!\nDie Story ist auch der EINZIGE Grund, wieso ich dieses Spiel empfehlen kann. \n- Transferiberbarer Spielstand\nWenn du ein Spiel durch hast, kannst du deinen erfahrenen Haseo auf das neue Game \u00fcbertragen. Finde ich prima, da man so das Gef\u00fchl hat, dass man auch wirklich weiter spielt und nicht alles verliert, was man m\u00fchsam zusammen gehamstert hat.\n- kein grinden\nDazu \u00e4u\u00dfere ich mich bei den negativen Punkten, aber es gibt ja Leute, die hassen es stundenlang durch Dungeons zu heizen und EP zu farmen. Was die Japaner auch annehmen, was vermutlich auch der Grund f\u00fcr die EP Anpassung gewesen ist. \n- sch\u00f6nes Remake\nGrafisch ist es nat\u00fcrlich kein Witcher 3, aber ich finde das gerade die richtigen Sequenzen sehr sch\u00f6n aussehen und wer auf den Anime Stil steht, der wird hier auch auf seine Kosten kommen.\n- viel Spiel, f\u00fcr wenig Geld\nAlso drei Games plus DLC... ich bin jetzt 33 Stunden dabei und am Anfang von Game 2. Gut, ich musste einige Dungeons wiederholen wegen den crashes aber nun ja. \n\nNegativ:\n- Crashes ZU HAUF\nZum Gl\u00fcck gibt es auf Steam einige versierte Nutzer, weswegen ich als Windows 10 Nutzern den heftigsten Crash Wellen entgegen wirken konnte, allerdings kommen Crashes DENNOCH regelm\u00e4\u00dfig vor. Was nicht mal schlimm w\u00e4re...\n-.... wenn man in Dungeons speichern k\u00f6nnte: Ohne Mist, man br\u00e4uchte das nicht, wenn das Spiel zuverl\u00e4ssig laufen w\u00fcrde, aber mir ist es jetzt schon OFT passiert, dass das Game einfach random abst\u00fcrzt und ich den Dungeon einfach komplett von vorne spielen darf. \n-Sehr leichter Schwierigkeitsgrad\nWenn ich an die ersten Teile denke, kommt mir vor allem der knackige Schwierigkeitsgrad in den Sinn. Was hab ich Kite und Black Rose durch die Dungeons pr\u00fcgeln m\u00fcssen, damit ich die teilweise echt schwierigen Bosse besiegen kann. Damals, jung und unerfahren wie ich war, bin ich irgendwann auch nicht mehr weiter gekommen. Das gibt es hier nicht, da man unglaublich schnell Erfahrung sammelt und sobald man ungef\u00e4hr 3-5 Level \u00fcber den Monstern ist, man diese mit zwei Schl\u00e4gen weghaut. Umgekehrt kann man aber auch in Dungeons gehen, die locker 15-20 Level \u00fcber einem sind, ohne das man f\u00fcrchten muss, dass man drauf geht. Da ist es wahrscheinlicher, dass die Crashes dich killen. \nEs hatte schon fast etwas am\u00fcsantes, wenn man im ersten Game in dem Turnier ist und man ANGEBLICH besiegt wird, obwohl der SUPERANGRIFF des gegen\u00fcbers kaum schaden macht. \nIch bin jetzt am Anfang des zweiten Games. Im ersten Game war der Max Level 50, sodass ich mit diesem auch angefangen habe. Die ersten Story Dungeons sind level 43. Dementsprechend langweilig ist der Einstieg, da ich davon AUSGEGANGEN bin, dass die Dungeons sich bei einem \u00fcbertragenen Spielstand anpassen w\u00fcrden. Sprich schwieriger sind. Dem ist aber nicht so. Und ich habe echt keine Dungeons nebenher gemacht, nur die Nebenquests und das, was man so in diesen Foren findet. Aber es ist nicht notwendig, in den Games zu grinden um voran zu kommen. Mir pers\u00f6nlich gef\u00e4llt das nicht so, da das f\u00fcr mich einen gro\u00dfen Reiz des .hack Gameplays hat. \n- Etwas eint\u00f6nig\nHat mich sonst nicht gest\u00f6rt, da ich gegrindet habe und mich jedes Level ungemein erfreut hat. Es gab kein Open End und du konntest von Level zu Level gehen, um besser zu werden. Jetzt wirken die Level eint\u00f6nig, die Dungeons sind immer gleich aufgebaut und auch das, was man dort tun muss, ist immer gleich. Auch die Nebenquests sind genauso eint\u00f6nig gemacht, nur die am\u00fcsanten Nebenstorylines sind es wert das zu machen. \n- Wahl der Synchronstimmen\nHeilige Maccaroni, die Stimme von dieser Atoli t\u00f6tet meine Ohren. Die Stimmen sind meistens gut gew\u00e4hlt. Haseo d\u00fcrfte Naruto Fans bekannt vorkommen (ich spreche von der englischen Variante), da er der Sprecher von Sasuke ist. Die Kampfger\u00e4usche von Pi gehen mir zwar auf die Nerven, kann man aber ertragen. Aber Atolis englische Stimme... alter Verwalter. \n\nTrotz der vielen negativen Punkte, w\u00fcrde ich mir G.U. DENNOCH noch mal kaufen. Denn ich habe weiter gespielt, trotz der crashes, trotz der nervigen Atoli und trotz eint\u00f6nigem Gameplay.

Years down the road I played the G.U series on an emulator.  Now, several years later, I was fortunate enough to see this remake come out on steam.  I love .hack for its story and the G.U. series does not disappoint.  IMO the story was quite interesting, I enjoyed the character development that happens throughout the series, and compared to the original series, G.U. felt very polished by comparison.  This remake takes something that was already wonderful and made it even better.\n\n     If you are new to .hack or at least the G.U. series.  I would suggest watching the .hack roots anime.  If you don't like anime or have time to watch it, you can still very much enjoy and understand the events in this game as they touch on past events that were important anyway.  The game is set up to simulate a real computer environment.  You have \"the world\" (the name of the MMO being played in the .hack series), your e-mail, online news and forums, etc.  All of this helps to set the tone for the game as well as create the actual world you are playing in.  You actually roleplay the person that is playing an MMORPG.\n     \n     There are several random NPC characters running around that act as simple player characters.  You can talk to them, trade with it, and gift them items as you would expect to be able to do with players in an MMO.  You party with various characters and go on quests and explore dungeons, as you might expect to do in an MMO.  I was actually quite surprised how far they went to make it feel that you were a person communicating with other players online and playing an MMO with them.  Now, is it completely realistic or a perfect simulation of this?  Of course not!  However, it does the job and does it quite well.  Read the news articles and forum posts as you progress throughout the game to see what is going on in the world, some events being a direct result of things happening in the MMO.\n\n     .Hack was truely ahead of its time.  Perhaps to it's detriment.  Hopefully it will see a bit of a revival as the \"trapped in an MMO\" thing has grown in popularity the last couple years.  If you have the money, you don\u2019t mind playing a single player game, and you want something fun with active combat (this is not turn based), a decent story that is pretty well told, something that feels larger than the game itself, and actually has character development (yes it exists) then try this game out especially if you are a fan of anything .hack!", "timestamp_created": 1510736647, "timestamp_updated": 1510736647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587209", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36525515": {"recommendationid": "36525515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137930597", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3983, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 185, "last_played": 1516076314}, "language": "english", "review": "my childhood", "timestamp_created": 1510724713, "timestamp_updated": 1510724713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36525251": {"recommendationid": "36525251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198323601589", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1672, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514424531}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

I never played the PS2 .hack//G.U. games, so I was very excited to see them remastered, and have the chance to log back into The World. \n\nThe 'world' of .hack// is immense. That being said, if you aren't familiar with the franchise, this game makes it easy to enter into the series. The \"Terminal Disc\" included also provides a synopsis of the original .hack// games (usually referred to as .hack//IMOQ), if you weren't able to play them when they originally released. Even so, that information is still background, and won't hinder your experience if you don't watch. I have been supplementing my gameplay by watching the .hack//SIGN series again, then the Terminal Discs, and now .hack//Roots (an anime that takes place right before G.U. actually begins).\n\nI'm currently working on Vol.1, so not sure how this will change, but so far I am enjoying the game. The characters are all memorable; most are clich\u00e9, but in a way that remains humorous. Some users have complained about the game being too easy (esp. those who played G.U. on PS2); while I cannot advise on the difference, I have found that often the combat is not difficult, unless encountering enemies that are quite higher in level. I don't have an issue with the pace of leveling, although the Weapon Skill leveling (separate from Character Level) isn't as transparent as it could be. \n\nSomething that I have always enjoyed about the .hack games is the 'meta' game. The MMO where most of the action occurs, \"The World,\" is just one aspect of the actual game - you also have access to the Official and Community Forums, News Site, and Email. In essence, you're playing the person who is playing the character of Haseo. While this adds to the immersion, it can occasionally become inconvenient - for example, after reaching a certain point in the area, in order to progress, you have to Log Out, check your email to see that you've qualified for the next step, and then you can log back in and proceed. \n\nIt is worth noting that there are some issues with this port, which hopefully the developers will patch soon. This game is clearly made to be played with a controller, but it only has Xbox controls native (odd given that steam supports DS4 controller, and the game is originally from PS2 and has a PS4 port). There are some mods which address this, but it's unfortunate that it wasn't included. Many people encountered issues with the 'anti-aliasing.' I personally play on a laptop not geared towards high-end gaming, so I had to decrease the resolution, but once done was able to get consistent 60fps. \n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys JRPGs, people who are interested in learning more about the .hack franchise, and definitely to those who are longtime fans of the series.", "timestamp_created": 1510691550, "timestamp_updated": 1510691550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36514371": {"recommendationid": "36514371", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967230362", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1810, "last_played": 1516022214}, "language": "spanish", "review": "exactamente como un remaster debe ser hecho.\nbandai-namco se ha lucido en esta ocasi\u00f3n, salvo los ligeros glitches(recordemos que ha salido hace menos de una semana al momento de escribir este an\u00e1lisis) el juego esta rebalanceado para los tres primeros cap\u00edtulos sean una experiencia lineal osea que ninguno de los tres sea mas grindeable o dif\u00edcil que el resto. un buen gasto de dinero, realmente recomendado", "timestamp_created": 1510676278, "timestamp_updated": 1510676278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36513320": {"recommendationid": "36513320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053969744", "num_games_owned": 416, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512495871}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all, before saying this game is a SAO ripoff go wikipedia about .Hack and SAO and read the release times, ok?\n\nPlayed G.U.

There is a lot to do in each volume besides the main story. \n+ Soundtrack was excellent, and the voice acting ( I played with the Japanese dub) was solid.\n+ Good port, had no real issues worth mentioning.

The main character, Haseo, falls into this category for most of the first game. Thankfully he grows out of it later. Same could be said for Atoli.\n- Do not go into this game expecting a complex dungeon crawler with an amazing combat system. One of the game's biggest issues is its repetitive nature. \n- This is especially prevalent with the dungeon/quest design. You will get very sick of seeing this one cave dungeon that the developers just love to use for so many of the quests and side quests over and over again. To add to that most of the story missions are set in the worst most repetitive and boring dungeons (out of the 8 or so dungeons styles there are in the game).\n- The boss battles and overall difficulty of the game is pretty low. I never found a need to grind other than to raise my level enough to use certain weapons that I acquired. The game is very easy, there were a handful of moments were I felt pressured and that was mostly due to not bringing a dedicated healer (Atoli) or purposefully fighting bosses several levels higher than me. \n- The crafting/upgrading system was pretty meh.

Conditional Recommend, but I would wait for a sale.[/b]\n\nAfter playing through the first game, I've got to say I'm a little disappointed.  The biggest impression that the game left on me is \"this looks cheap.\"  There are very few areas, the graphics are not great (even for 2006), the gameplay is mashy and not difficult, and the story (at least at the end of volume 1) really smacks of stuff I've seen a hundred times.  Maybe this was a big thing back when .hack was new, but this was still many years after Ultima Online, Everquest, even World of Warcraft.  MMO's weren't really that mysterious...\n\nI guess my biggest problem with the game is how many other fantastic RPGs were on PS2 for years before this game came out, which leads me to my conclusion that this game feels really cheap.  I could probably list a couple dozen PS2 games which were better in all ways than these and came out before.  When you stack it next to games like Grandia, Dark Cloud, Tales of Symphonia, SMT: Nocturne, Shadow Hearts, FF12, and Persona 3, it falls flat on its face.  It just seems [i]really uninteresting[/i].\n\n(Man I would love a modern release of Shadow Hearts and Shadow Hearts: Covenant... I wonder who has the rights nowadays.)\n\nI know those two paragraphs make me sound like I'm down on the game, but I'm really not.

It is not a very challenging game on its own, in fact you can pretty much Breeze through most the storyline with very little challenge if you know what you're doing. the combat is very simple to the point where it may become boring for any normal encounter but there are plenty of boss monsters and special boss battles that completely changed the formula, that I won't go into detail with because of spoilers. the only fault that I had with the characters is that the Maine character starts off as an ass; there's no avoiding it he's an ass at first.

And I am happy to say that the majority of those expectations were either met or exceeded. But before I go into all my positives of the game so far (Note I have only 100% the first volume so far) let's quickly go over the negatives before the positives.\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]This PC port had its fair share of issues when I was trying to play the game at the start, such as the game not using the right graphics card or the fact that the game would crash like 10 minutes in until I was able to fix said issue by turning off some background program in Windows. So needless to say, it was a real pain trying to play this game.\n[*]Also in terms of some of the changes they made, I feel that they really should have included a harder difficulty mode because with the increased exp gain and whatnot, it is really easy to get over-leveled in the game early on and as a result I had to solely focus on the main story stuff for quite a while until the levels caught up to me. \n[*]Some might find the game to be lacking in the visual department since despite it being an HD remaster,the look hasn't changed too much from the original PS2 games.\n[*]Finally, just like the original trilogy, the game's tutorial goes on for way too long and it also likes to railroad you into following the plot rather than just letting you do your own thing early on, which is annoying. Also in said tutorial, they use the term 'noob' way too much, which is aggravating to say the least.\n\n[*][i]PS: I hate Gaspard and Bikman's flyer quest.[/i]\n[/list]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]I find the combat to be rather simple, but still quite enjoyable. The enemies offer a reasonable level of challenge as long as you aren't over-leveled and there are a variety of enemy types that keep the battles from getting too monotonous.\n[*]I still love how the dungeons are made with choosing three key words from a list in order to decide the type of difficulty. It's just such a fun concept and the fact that you get rewarded more key words by completing dungeons and visiting the forums just make its even better.\n[*]Speaking of the forums, the main menu when you are not logged into the game is probably one of my favorite parts since you just get to see what's going on in the world, get to hear what you're fellow npc characters in the game are up to, and in general I feel it really nails the feeling of playing an online game.\n[*]I ended up loving almost all of the characters as the story develops and Haseo's story really just pulls you in and makes you want to see how he develops along with his fellow players and goes from a character who resembles Sasuke from the Naruto series, to how I wish Sasuke ended up.\n[*]Also the music in this game is pretty great and the voice acting for the dub at least is mostly stellar with a few exceptions.\n[/list]\nOverall, despite the problems mentioned above, I really love this game series and cannot wait to 100% the rest of the game. And to all those who are even remotely interested in giving this series a shot, I would definitely recommend taking the plunge because it is truly a game series worth playing.", "timestamp_created": 1510509084, "timestamp_updated": 1510509264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36470914": {"recommendationid": "36470914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092415775", "num_games_owned": 613, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511240460}, "language": "english", "review": "The World is probably the best MMO ever\n>No lag\n>No microtransactions\n>Your choices actually affect the real world", "timestamp_created": 1510496200, "timestamp_updated": 1510502446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 74, "votes_funny": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.823535", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36470703": {"recommendationid": "36470703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078999173", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510487908}, "language": "english", "review": "TTTTRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIII--EEEEEEEEDGEEEEEEEE", "timestamp_created": 1510495577, "timestamp_updated": 1510495577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36469644": {"recommendationid": "36469644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005440960", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510462808}, "language": "english", "review": ">>>Mostly spoiler free<<<\nOnly spoils are estimates on how long the game would take \n\n\n\nTL;DR if you're wanting to play all the games, you can expect about 80 hours of content (Not counting the longer grinds). But it's not worth it just for the 4TH game.\n\n\nIf you want to play just the NEW GAME, don't bother. It's only about two or three hours tops. They even literally disable al lthe side content and even though they updated the models to look more modern (Only in this game for some reason?), only having like two dungeons to run that are both generic is pretty boring. There's no side missions, no events, no special thing you can do. Just a short epilouge plot that expands on the lore some and ties up loose ends kind of nicely. They even got most (or all?) of the old voice actors for returning characters, so the voices soudn fine.\n\nNew game aside, the old games were HD'd in a nice way that doesn't take away from them, but it's also pretty clear it's just HD'd PS2 games, so the models themselves look old; but they overall hold up decently since thanks to a lot of care being put into them back when they were first made; you'll just notice hair clipping or blocky hands outside of cutscenes.. A lot of clear love was put into it to make sure it all translated well. I dind't have any major issues with the games, Only crashed once in over 80 hours, No audio desync issues (in the first three games anyway), everything functions the same, and the games actually hold up fairly well when compared to modern games. There's plenty of secrets to find, optional grind quest with fun little rewards but nothing mandatory, the games can be as hard as you make them (if you just do story it can be pretty hard, but it's easy to go and out grind them to easily breeze through the story).\n\n\nIf you're looking for a really long game experience and want a game that looks pretty nice and is fairly actiony without much filler plot, this is a decent game to pick up. It's got multiple twist and turns ot the story with a pretty deep and complex world where they actually took the time to make fake forum post by people, even having a bunch of random artist make art for the game so people on the forums could post their own art in various different styles. They made anime news videos to look like actual news reporters talking to you about stuff, and a decently long news series where you kind of get to see how people in the real world respond to stuff going on in your game world (and see what the effects are, it gives nice context to what you're doing).\n\n\nHonestly what befudles me is how the New game had them go through the trouble of updating all the models of characters you don't get much time with and making them look nice, but they didn't just put that in the older games and left those mostly un touched. The new game mostly just plays the same as the old ones. You eventually get the New Form you see on the cover art, and it has a clear amount of love put into it with very unique attacks and combos that are a ton of fun to watch and use.... but again, the new game is so short and you don't have any areas to really go and enjoy it.\n\n\nHopefully we'll see more from this series, I'd love it if .hack made some big comeback, and it does kind of hint that there's possibilities for a new story to start, but I'm finding it really unlikely as of right now.", "timestamp_created": 1510492807, "timestamp_updated": 1510492967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36467228": {"recommendationid": "36467228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062531587", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510764669}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u304c\u3063\u3064\u308a\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u9014\u4e2d\u3067\u3059\u304c\u3001\u3068\u3066\u3082\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u304f\u9762\u767d\u3044\u3067\u3059\n\u8272\u3005\u306a\u30b3\u30f3\u30d7\u8981\u7d20\u3067\u4e2d\u3005\u9032\u3081\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3059\u304c\u305d\u308c\u3082\u307e\u305f\u826f\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\nPS4\u7248\u521d\u56de\u751f\u7523\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u304f\u308b\u7279\u5178\u3092DLC\u6271\u3044\u3067\u8cfc\u5165\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3068\u5c1a\u826f\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059", "timestamp_created": 1510486066, "timestamp_updated": 1510486066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538462", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36463261": {"recommendationid": "36463261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047989141", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 874, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512187519}, "language": "english", "review": "So there are a few people giving this  incredible game negative reviews. PLEASE do not take them into effect. There is absolutly no lag issues. In fact the game moves quicker than the original release back on PS2. It is the same game you know and love with upresed textures. XP gain was slight buffed for whatever reason but it isnt enough that it ruins the game. Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS GAME!

I love this series so much, the nostalgia alone from the opening cutscenes gives me chills. Seeing it remastered in HD is literally a wet dream come true.\n\nHowever, this is a poor port (as of right now). The game on its base settings moves VERY slow. The cutscene's, dialog, movement all look like they've been set to 1/2 speed. I have tried adjusting the settings after doing some comment digging. Turning off shadows, anti-aliasing and playing in windowed bordeless mode on 1280 x 720 does infact fix the 1/2 game speed issue. The game will run smooth as butter after that, but you end up sacraficing (at least I do) a large unused portion of your pc screen.\n\nFor how big a fan I am I was willing to make that sacrafice for overall playability.\n\nNow here comes the dealbreaker. The crashes.\n\nThis port REGULARLY crashes during cutscenes. The good news is it isn't consistent from what i've experienced (it never just walled and crash during one specific part of a cutscene or dialog), but thats also bad news all the same. You never know when it will crash, or when the crash is coming. You just know it will be during a cutscene if it does, and not all cutscenes seem to trigger a crash. \n\nTo add salt to the wound, the way this game is set up, you do not have the capability to save in the middle of \"Areas\" (or dungeons if you want to call them that). You can save either before or after leaving an area. Area's (not all of them but mandatory ones needed to progress the stoy) have cutscene's! So imagine running 2/3rds of an Area just for the game to crash during a cutscene at the end of it. With no way to save mid Area, you have to literally restart the game, and repeat the area- in the hopes the cutscene wont trigger the crash, with no garuntee.\n\n...And well you see, the way my bank account is set up- REFUND!\n\nP.S. In all honesty this would be a 10/10 for me if the bugs are fixed. Fix the 1/2 speed game issue, and fix the crash issue. My fear is that, as i've seen with a lot of ports- they get released and essentially forgotten, with either ridculous wait times for patches to be rolled out, or no patches ever being released at all.\n\nI'm STILL waiting for Nier to be patched to working status.\n\nI get this was barely added to steam, so I'm not that upset- but I will be refunding this and checking in to see if/when a patch rolls out to fix these issues.

Then again, you might want the opinion and analysis of someone who's played the games since the beginning.\n\nThat aside, from what I've seen, this is an excellent remaster.  Visuals have been cleaned up, animations look far smoother than they ever were on the PS2, audio is crisp, camera moves smoothly as well... pretty much what you'd expect a good remaster to do is done here.  It's a solid HD port.\n\nThis is one game that you'll want to play on a controller, though.  Not saying that it's going to be difficult with K+M, but if you want to get the full experience from when the G.U. games were on PS2, you'll want to get a gamepad for your computer.  It feels more intuitive, I guess.  Aside from that, controls are fine.\n\nCombat is the same as it was on the PS2, so if you've played the G.U. Trilogy on PS2 or on an emulator, there won't be any difference with the combat itself, aside from some changes done by Bandai Namco to make the games easier for newcomers.\n\nSpeaking of which, there are a number of minor changes that make the game easier, both with general QoL as well as in combat.  Haseo's running speed is significantly faster than it was in the PS2 games, making traversing dungeons and larger fields feel like less of a chore.  You can carry 90 items and 90 pieces of equipment from the beginning, rather than starting with 30 and upgrading through the volumes as you play them.  You can also carry 99 of each consumable/mod item, so chances are that with some minor inventory management, you'll never run out of room.  This makes trading considerably easier, because you'll have more throwaway items to trade towards equipment and items you want (which is really helpful with the Book of 1000 sidequest).  You can also hold up to 999 Chim Spheres, whereas in the original games you couldn't hold any more than 99 (this makes dealing with Steam doors and the Mecha Grunty sidequest SOOOOOOO MUCH EASIER).\n\nI believe there are also some changes to how much damage Haseo and his party can do to enemies, and the Avatar battles have been made somewhat easier by increasing the damage from Skeith's shots.  Besides that, if you do die in battle, the game gives you the option to retry that fight (which was not in the PS2 games).  This is to avoid the problem of having to reload a previous save, which is helpful if you haven't saved for some time.  However, with certain random encounters (particularly the Chaotic PKs for the Bounty Hunter sidequest), it potentially means you're stuck in a fight with an enemy that can kill you in one or two hits if you're too low in level, and you'll either have to spend a lot of time trying to win a tough fight or just reload from your last save.  This can be problematic.  Of course, since this is an RPG, you should be saving regularly anyway.  :P  Speaking of saving and loading, it goes by in a flash; the PS2 versions had periods between cutscenes and transitioning from field to root towns where it could load for up to a couple of minutes, and saving took several seconds.  Now there's none of that.\n\nAside from this, I've also noticed a few neat extras that weren't in the PS2 version of Rebirth: additional backgrounds for your in-game desktop which are really cool (I have one of the new ones set up right now, and I'm enjoying its look), and some minor costmetic changes to some features, such as the affection gauge for your party members being a heart now instead of just a stylized circle.\n\nVoice acting in the game has been cleaned up a bit and is essentially the same as it was in volume 1, although there were a few points in the game where it did sound like the voice acting was obviously recorded, breaking immersion a bit (I'm talking about a slight echo that tells that they took the audio in a booth, for example).  Also, two of the tracks that you can unlock to play on your in-game desktop don't seem to work, so there are some minor audio bugs that need taking care of.  In addtion, sometimes you'll get awkward camera angles that I don't remember there being in the original PS2 games.  And I've only come across a couple of graphical glitches; they weren't game-breaking, thankfully, but they were rather obvious.\n\nThe voice acting itself is standard mid-2k anime VA: competent, but hammy at times.  From what I've seen of footage of vol. 4, that has changed, but I'm expecting volumes 1 through 3 to be the same.  Not that there's anything necessarily wrong with that: some of the ham has its charm and adds to the game, though for some players it might be off-putting, since voice acting in games and anime have improved drastically since 2006-2008.\n\nYes, there are achievements for this game, and if you've 100%ed the PS2 games, you'll likely get most, if not all, of the achievements here.  But for those who haven't played the original PS2 versions, you'll likely find most of the achievements fairly easy to obtain with some effort.  It helps that there are in-game material rewards for doing actions and sidequests that you'd unlock the achievements for, anyway.\n\nOverall, as far as I've played thus far, this is a solid remaster, and I'd recommend it to anyone seeking a JRPG series that isn't Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, Tales, or Persona (or who has already played those series extensively and want more).  The story overall is at least passable, and there are genuine moments where you'll be really invested in the game's narrative.  The strong point of the .hack//G.U. series isn't its plot: its how the characters deal with the problems that they face, how they come into conflict with each other as the narrative and story progresses, and how they overcome those conflicts.  There's a bit of deus ex machina, but it's at acceptable anime-esqe levels.  You also have voice acting from a number of notable English VAs who have done a lot of other work in anime and video games: Johnny Yong Bosch, Liam O'brien, Yuri Lowental, Steven Blum, and Erin Fitzgerald are just a few of the famous names to be found, and their performances are well-executed.\n\nI'll add more about volumes 3 and 4, as well as Parody Mode, when I get to them.\n\nOne final aside.  I'm personally hoping this remaster is financially successful for Bandai Namco, both on the PC and PS4.  Not just because I'm a fan of the .hack series and I want to see more of the franchise (potentially come over to the West), but also because I'm hoping that this game's success will lead to Bandai Namco doing an HD remaster of another cult-hit JRPG trilogy that I adore: Xenosaga episodes 1, 2, and 3.\n\nMake it happen, Bandai Namco, and I will pay all the money I can get to have KOS-MOS in 1080 on my PC.

That is not to say that people who dont know the .hack brand will not enjoy this game but it will be very hard to overlook its many flaws. \n\n1. This game is a set of 3 games + an epilouge (which is brand new I might add), which originally were released back in 2006-2008, they were originally on the ps2 and were fairly advanced for the standards back then, with some truly impressive graphics for the pre-rendered scenes and even the character models were nicely designed (for some of the up-close shots).\n\n2. This game is very dated in its design. It captures the essense of playing a \"single-player\" MMO perfectly. You are an average person playing this fictional game. But that in and of itself brings about some odd continuity problems. Such as having to log out of the game to check email, then logging back into the game immediately for a cut scene and then logging out to check email again. The progression is OK by 2006 standards, but very archaic by 2017 standards (which is where the game is supposed to take place as an odd twist of fate)\n\n3. Combat is repetitive. sure, this could be said for every game for the most part, but in .hack its especially so. Since the game is modeled after an MMO, which is by nature repetitive, it does take a while for the combat to pick up, and once you have unlocked everything thats it, there is nothing else to get. Combat revolves around mashing or holding the X (A for you Xbox pad players) and occasionally hitting R1 (right bumper) to activate a skill. The battles are highly skewed in the player's favor, with time coming to a complete stop during these skills and being completely invulnerable during thier animations. This is somewhat alleviated in volumes 2 and 3 with some very smart additions, but it does not take away from the simplicity of the combat. It is nowhere near as rediculous as the first set of .hack games (original quadrilogy), but its got its share of problems. thankfully theyve fixed a number of them with this re-release.\n\n4. Story and Voice acting. This game has some very high production values, but there was something they could not avoid when they were re-releasing this and that was how voiceovers were handled. Because of how the old games were formatted in a 4:3 aspect ratio, the subtitles were done in such a way that they would constantly cut people off the in the middle of sentences, the middle of thoughts and it would just sound awkward if you read the line in its entirety. Since they did not go back and re-record the voies for 10 year old games, there are absolutely spots in the game where the voice acting is slow, and plodding, and the tone is not quite right. But there are also spots where the emotion of the characters is properly conveyed because the voice cast is very very high quality.  The story itself is hit or miss. You will either be completely on board with this non-sensical way of handling computer data and dealing with viruses and bugs. or you will not be impressed by the intersocial aspect of how this game handles its characters. But one thing this game does very well is character development. Main and side characters all get some kind of development, with haseo being the best example. \n\n5. Remake quality. As a fan of the original series and someone who played the games on ps2 to death, i can say that this game does the originals justice by fixing some issues with translations, fixing alot of gameplay issues, but it does bring up a few new ones. Simply because of how easy it is to level and how much more damage you do to enemies, some fights have lost thier challenge, and its easier than ever to over-level and completely trivialize the game. However, a big problem I personally found was that since on the ps2 you had alot of time in between releases to grind out weapon proficiencies, it was very easy in the re-release to be UNDER leveled in those areas. Sure you'd be capped out in the game but you'd be using weaponskills from the beginning of the game still because you blew through it so fast. \n\nIn most cases this would not be an issue but it does take away from the joy of being \"well prepared\" for the subsequent volumes. You could very well grind out weapons and stuff before progressing but the allure of the story (at least for me) was too powerful for me to consider dumping extra time into the older volumes, espeically considering I knew where the story was going and what to expect. \n\nIn terms of how well the game performs on PC, I give it an A-. I had one problem with a bug during my play time that cost me an hour, but after that I never encountered a bug again.

Story isn't so bad, after completing the first part (Rebirth), it has me hooked. Music is nice and main characters are well written (though I have to say some are obnoxious.) I play using japanese dub, because english voices are cringy at best. \n\nThe AI on my companions SUCK during battles. The only wise choice to have is to put them on rage mode, and heal as necessary yourself. In Infection/Mutation/Outbreak/Quarantine, there were several different presets you could command your companions with, now it's either put them on a free running mode (Free-will) all out berserk (Rage) or hit, heal (occasionally) and run (Life). Really? What happened to the other options? Like attack if healing is not needed (Support)? If you could do it before, on PS2, why not now? Seriously.... \n\nOh, before anyone starts b1tching about anything, I have never played G.U on PS2, so I don't know how things worked in that version. \n\n//Edit 12th Nov -17// One other thing that bothered me the most is the fact that there is no option to skip the little cut scenes that occur when you move into a trap room (doors close and the camera shows you the mechanism to release it. I get it the first time, I don't need to be reminded of it 10 times in one dungeon, alright?!) or you get all the pieces of the symbols that opens the door to the temple. I get it from the first time, I don't need to see the door open EVERY single time I clear an area. I understand the point in this is to simulate the game within a game, but even so, it just gets old... and annoying.\n\n//Edit 27th Nov 2017// Okay, after completing the story of the three first games, I'm very annoyed. The story is... forgettable (really, I don't remember what happened in Part 1 and part 2 even if I just played them through. All I can remember are the tedious boss fights in your avatar form. Also.... this game should be called DOTHACK//Holding Hand. Because everytime you arrive in a town, or something, and there's a major event in the main story, you're reminded of it CONSTANTLY. I heard you the first time around, I don't need to be reminded of what I need to do. Besides I can always check my Memoir if I can't remember what I'm supposed to do. Geez. \nBut even so, I may be nitpicking things... but I still liked this game. Sadly it is a medicore action hack and slash mystery RPG, a videogame where you play a videogame. \n\nBandai, please. Import .Hack//Infection, Mutation, Ourbreak and Quarantine to PC. Please? Pretty please? It was better than this.\n\nBut enough about that. \n\nTL:DR: Despite its flaws I enjoyed this game.

I wanted to wait until I had completed one game before posting a review, so I could give what I feel to be a fair assessment. I played the original games years ago on the PS2.)\n\nLike many others, this was a guranteed buy to me for nostalgia bucks. .hack was a major interest of mine ten years ago, and after .hack as a franchise being in stagnation for years, words couldn't describe my happiness at learning these games were being re-released, remastered, and even getting a fourth installment. But, you know, we live in an era where Mighty No 9 happened. Not to mention a lot of talk about \"dumbing down\" from the old games (hint: it wasn't dumbing down).\n\nI'll go on about this, but for now here's a tl;dr: it's just as enjoyable as it was back then, looks better (mostly), and gameplay wise is vritually indistinguishable despite it's changes. I will not talk too much about the plot or core gameplay, other than this is a surprisingly story-heavy game for those of you who are not familiar with .hack, and it's gameplay can best be described as solid hack-and-slash, in my opinion. It is an EXTREMELY fun game to play, and a very fun universe to unravel and learn as well. Rather, I want to talk about the derisive changes people are debating, as well as some issues people are having with the game lagging or not starting up.\n\nLet's start talking about some of the gameplay changes:\n\n>Attacks deal more damage\n>More EXP\n>Retry function\n>Chim Sphere cap increased\n>Bullets faster in avatar battles\n>Reduction in hitstop and battle tempo inscreased\n>Cheat mode\n>Movement speed increased\n\nIn conclusion, after playing Volume 1: virtually nothing has changed between now and the PS2 with these functions in mind.\n\nGo into a high level area well before your time? It's not gonna save you. Infinite retires can't save you whene very enemy oneshots you. The reality is this: G.U. was never hard franchise. When I was only 13-15, outside of Doppelganger fights (mostly because I was really dumb in how I approached them back then), I don't think I got more than five game overs as a child. If I did, it definitely wasn't more than 10 (excluding the final Avatar battle of Vol 3, which I doubt will give me as much issues these times).\n\nThese changes were not \"dumbing it down\" it's making the game go faster. The difficulty is roughly the same as back then. To clarify what this means, the game has greatly increased in it's speed, which is a boon as the PS2 versions sometimes... slagged a bit. Level grinding (btw, G.U. to this day remains the only game I enjoy level grinding in) is less tedious if you aim to go that route (I can't help but reccomend trying to \"stay\" at story-level to keep some fun bosses being a cakewalk, but it's usually not that bad). Clearing areas is quicker, and it definitely does not feel easier than before, granted it already wasn't hard.\n\nIf you find Last Recode easy, you'll find the originals easy too.\n\n\"Dumbing down,\" is an immensely annoying phrase that's entered gamer lingo, one that is tossed at this game often before it was even relased, which is disheartning. This is not a game that has experienced of it: these changes make the game a little less slow and tedious, not \"dumb it down for casuals.\" If you could play G.U. back then, you can play it now. Having more Chim Spheres is good: you can stock up on them for long dungeons where you don't care about the Chim reward for a mission rank and you just want to level up or get the beast statue treasure. I doubt you'll need retries, but at least the option is there. If you bit more than you can handle and you want to Retry just so you can use a smoke screen and not lose your progress?\n\nIt's a video game. Do what you want if it's fun! You want to use cheat mode? You bought the damn game, go nuts if it lets you have fun.\n\nIf anything, I'm disappointed they didn't change how Duel Swords and Broadswords function in Vol 1. In pre-release material it was reported that \"Improvements that were made in Vol. 2: Reminisce and Vol. 3: Redemption will be reflected on Vol. 1: Rebirth in the HD Remaster.\" You know, maybe this one IS just me not remembering, but quite frankly? I don't see ANY changes. Duel Swords still only combo 3-4 hits, and you still can't move while charging a power attack with a Broadsword in Volume 1. While it was still immensely fun to play after so many years, I can't help but see myself not returning very often to Volume 1 as a result, sadly. I still cannot speak negative of it: while the beginning of Volume 1 is still a bit slow in my opinion, that's a story issue and not a gameplay one.\n\nThe graphics are something else I've seen some people mixed on. It's important to remember this is not a remake: it's an HD remaster. They took the old graphics and booted them up to 1080p and made them prettier. It's still a ten year old PS2 game though.\n\nI will comment on Vol 4's graphics when I get there.\n\nYes, there's some clipping issues. Sometimes it's very blocky, and doesn't look too great at times. Something I had never noticed when I was younger actually is the fact that in a lot of cutscenes, lots of people's mouths didn't move. Probalby a mixture of me being directly at my screen unlike the PS2 days with some distance and being 1080p. So don't expect this looking like a game made brand-new from scratch during 2016-2017. It's not, and it's on you if you're expecting the best visually looking game ever made.\n\nThere are two issues I have heard people talk about, and I will give my opinion on both:\n\n>Unusually high lag\n>Doesn't seem to start up\n\nI admittingly at first had a lag issue, even with all graphics set to low. I was surprised as this is a good gaming laptop that can play Dark Souls 3 at high graphics with relatively little problem. However, I have a laptop with Nvidia: after doing a little fix (I have posted about this in discussions) I was able to discover this was an issue with Nvidia chosing not to run the game on high settings for some reason. After that, the game runs fun on high graphics, and my girlfriend with a good PC has no issues either.\n\nIt's weird, but I think it's more of a \"you\" issue than a bad port. Still, more than one person has reported such issues, so I suppose beware: in a worst case scenario, don't play more than two hours if you cannot get it to work at all.\n\nI don't know this issue with the game just not starting or crashing. Again, neither me nor anyone I know who has played this game has had this issue. I want to say it's a \"you\" problem, but more than one person has happened. Saddly, I can offer no real input or advise on it.\n\nIn conclusion?\n\nI love this. I loved it back then, and I love it now. I was genuinely happy to buy this game, and I'm genuinely happy to play it. If you'd liek a story-driven anime hack-and-slash with a plot, character evolution (one of the most important things by far is how much Haseo grows up between Volumes 1 and 3 from this edgelord seeking revenge to someone who truly cares for his friends, and Atoli's progression from a doormat into a woman who can stand on her own and even confront the one who ruined her life), a fantastic universe with commentary on the rise of the internet era and the internet's impact on the real world, then I cannot express my encouragement to play this game.\n\nIf you are a returning player, then welcome back. 'The World' is ready for you, with a brand new adventure to boot.\n\nAnd if you are a new player, one who is interested in .hack because you heard about it but could never find a way to play it before (PS2 exclusives each worth a fortune), wanted to play it because you wanted to play the OG \"this setting is about an MMORPG that's scewing up the real world,\" because you're a fan of SAO and wanted to try something you think is similar, or because you hated SAO and heard this was a better version?\n\nWelcome to 'The World.'", "timestamp_created": 1510257314, "timestamp_updated": 1512080786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541586", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36404055": {"recommendationid": "36404055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061344848", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511545693}, "language": "english", "review": "Still waiting for waifu alkaid to join my party", "timestamp_created": 1510257192, "timestamp_updated": 1510257192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36403823": {"recommendationid": "36403823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000807456", "num_games_owned": 376, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 4055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511141403}, "language": "english", "review": "Do I recommend this game?

Unless you're a big fan of it just don't buy it... and if cyberconnect2 seas this please, please release a patch that returns all of it back to normal or at least an option to do so.

Characters are great, design of towns, and dungeons are gorgeous, combat, both player and Avatar battles are intuitive and fun.", "timestamp_created": 1510093266, "timestamp_updated": 1510093266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36353302": {"recommendationid": "36353302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022102436", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512187440}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh hey, it's nostalgia that doesn't ruin the nostalgia (read: It's just as good as I remember).

What a cool concept! To play the future of video games, today! But then the plot develops and you get caught in a storm of both wonderful and scary events. The series is, without a doubt, unique in its origins. And .hack//G.U. Last Recode brings with it the remastering of this unique origin. It reinvigorates a formula that has been worked hard by the series and, in many ways, hit a very high point with the G.U. Vol 1 - 3 on the Sony PS2. Finally having these three volumes and an extra one to boot for the PC is an amazing opportunity and I for one find this entire journey nostalgic in the very best of ways and would love to hear about more people picking it up for the first time so they too can experience the joys and wonders of 'The World'.\n\nHaving been playing it again I find it so relaxing to take my time and 100% each volume; its as complete as I remember and I've even taken more time to find \"bugs\" which fit well once you get deeper into the storyline, very nice touches by the devs I never caught before!", "timestamp_created": 1510092198, "timestamp_updated": 1511654919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36352797": {"recommendationid": "36352797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093536126", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2974, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511128697}, "language": "english", "review": "Fine port so far.

As a veteran of the games, it took me 16 hours to beat Vol. 1's main story, plus an additional 10 hours of (fairly repetitive) grinding for 100%. My playtimes for the other volumes were:\nVol. 2: Beat the game- 25 Hours. 100%- 38 Hours.\nVol. 3: Beat the game- 22 Hours. 100%- 45 Hours.\nVol. 4: Beat the game- 3 Hours.\nTotal: Approx. 112 Hours.\nAgain, I'm a veteran, so if you're new to these games and want to go for 100%, you should probably expect 120+ hours of playtime across all 4 volumes.\n (You may notice my actual playtime is higher, I played through Vol. 1 a second time on release for a stream.)\n\nA few comments, take them as you will:\n-Except in certain instances, characters' mouths do not move when they talk.\n-There are a few very minor glitches and I have experienced the occasional crash while playing; not nearly enough to stop me from continuing.\n-The previously-limited-edition Terminal Disc is included, which will help bring you up to speed on the lore and the story of the original series for new players, and expand on the existing lore for veterans.\n-The trailers claim to have taken the various improvements made in Volumes 2 and 3 and applied them to the first game. This is only partially true; some features from the 2nd and 3rd Volumes are still not present in Vol. 1, such as the improved combo mechanics of the twin blades or better charge attacks of the broadsword, or, perhaps most importantly, the quick-switch mechanic.\n-Some of the Bonus Content cutscenes (Terminal Disc included) are not updated to HD, and are displayed in a small window within the game. This does not apply to the cutscenes seen throughout the games themselves; only the extra ones you unlock at the end.\n-The game's EXP, Skill Points, and Attack Power have been rebalanced to provide a much smoother leveling curve. This version, therefore, is much easier than the originals.\n-Features a \"Cheat Mode\" that allows you to play through the story at max level. Considering the point above, this is mostly inconsequential, as you will rarely have to grind in a normal playthrough anyway.\n-Textures and models still look decidedly old, but passable. The lighting engine and cel-shading go a long way to help this.\n-The game was made for the PS2, as such it is meant to be played with a controller. It does support DirectInput, as well as all the modern controller APIs.\n-Keyboard controls can be re-mapped, but mouse and controller cannot.\n-There are 6 new BGMs (available in Vol. 4) and a total of 31 new Backgrounds (Throughout all 4 volumes) that can be used to customize your ingame Desktop. The original Desktop Backgrounds are not updated to the new widescreen format, and are letterboxed in order to maintain their original aspect ratio.\n\nVolume 4 is EXTREMELY short, and many of the features of the first 3 volumes are missing. It is entirely focused on the story, with the only side-content being one final dungeon after beating the game. Its story and presentation are decent, but because of the short runtime it falls flat in my opinion.\n\nThe game also features \"Parody Mode\", a series of cutscenes from the games with edited dialogue. It's probably the best new addition in Last Recode, to be honest.\n\nAll-in-all, I think this collection has been well worth my $50 so far, if only for the first three volumes.\n\n(Edit: Updated to reflect my playthroughs of the second, third, and fourth volumes.)", "timestamp_created": 1510036900, "timestamp_updated": 1511137267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.837462", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36337078": {"recommendationid": "36337078", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975671721", "num_games_owned": 616, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513816140}, "language": "english", "review": "game crashes my entire pc when it closes, this is a sever bug.  im past refund time and the developers i doubt will help me out.", "timestamp_created": 1510036320, "timestamp_updated": 1510079131, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.187642", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36336728": {"recommendationid": "36336728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037428345", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511466088}, "language": "english", "review": "I reasonably well done remaster of a great trilogy originaly designed for playstation. A few things did happen to be lost in translation, however, which causes the game to behave quite differently in some parts and its very obvious if you have played the originals. Overall, definately worth getting if you liked the original series and want to play on the PC. Below is my list detailing all the faults and counterrarguments I've noticed so far. If you've never played this series, I would definately suggest this purchase! If you already have a way of playing the original, I would probably say stick with the original unless the convenience of having it on PC is desired.\n\nBecause the game actually runs faster than it did on the playstation, the beast awakening is quite hard to use because the faster attack speed causes you to drop combos very often unless you are outright mashing the button.\n\nThe voices and sound affects were changed slightly, which annoys me personally.\n\nThe increased graphical quality makes the lack of detail in the faces of many character models painfully obvious, which i guess overall is good?\n\nThe game tends to crash and cause a lot of problems with the PC. Just recently when I quit out of the game, it caused the monitor to read \"input type not supported\" until I restarted the graphics drivers. Although if you think of this as part of the game coming to life....maybe you will become more immersed? Just make sure to save before doing anything so you dont lose your progress, and hopefully soon they will patch out the crashing (I think some people are overexxaggerating just how much it crashes, In my 8 hours of play so far, it has actually crashed once.)\n\nThere is no way to adjust many setting in game (because they were designed for a console, you could never change these settings in the game themselves) so you have to quit out to adjust anything. Protip: turn on vsync or your screen will tear like paper.\n\nSome people are suggesting to run on an emulator, I would definately NOT suggest this! Almost all the graphical effects and cutscenes run like garbage on an emulator!\n\nSome people are saying the game is too easy on this version...but the game was easy to begin with.

If you're going to plug in an Xbox 360 controller into the PC and play it that way, then go for it. But if you aren't going to then I highly recommend to wait on your purchase, and here are my reasons why.\n\nI am a huge fan of the .hack franchise, I played the first volume back around the PS2 days and it was incredible. It will always be my favorite game, and sadly I had to force myself to refund the game. The reasons that I did this were because there are crashing issues and while people are saying this is a good port I must disagree. Unless you have an Xbox controller or use ds4windows with a Playstation controller, the control scheme is very confusing. You do not look around with the mouse at all, only keys on the keyboard which can get pretty annoying and downright frustrating if you're not use to that. The only thing the mouse is good for is left-click for 'A' and right-click for 'B' which is pointless because you can use 'ENTER' and 'BACKSPACE' for both of those. And I couldn't for the life of me understand what the base controls are, and while you CAN madify the control scheme to your liking, I feel that CyberConnect2 needs to make an update where the base controls are much easier to understand and make it easier to change them.\nAnd the crashing issues can most likely be fixed easily by changing one or two lines of code. They weren't even real crashes, more like a softlock during one certain part of the tutorial right after you use your skill attacks. \nAll in all I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this title because there is a nice story and it is overall a great experience, but I must say that you should wait on getting the game until they fix the controller scheme if you're going to use the keyboard.", "timestamp_created": 1510024611, "timestamp_updated": 1510024611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499650", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36334584": {"recommendationid": "36334584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023970177", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510022779}, "language": "english", "review": "Use of keyboard was badly implemented in this game.

"bien voy por la mitad del volumen 1 ya los he jugado en su \u00e9poca XD teniendo que esperar creo que eran 3 meses entre juego y juego\nestas son mis observaciones \n//LO MALO//\n*\nahora que el juego se ve mejor y tiene mejor definici\u00f3n se perciben mejor los errores (como la cara de IYoten cuando nos va a matar) al no ser un personaje muy recurrente se lo dejo mal terminado y literalmente parece que llevara una mascara de papel con su cara dibujada en ella (es HORRIBLE)\nsalvando ese detalle de friki continuo\n*\nesto no se si ponerlo como malo ya que puede ser del juego o de mi ordenador (as\u00ed que esta es mas una ACOTACI\u00d3N PERSONAL) el juego en algunas ocasiones se cuelga y solo queda cerrarlo usando el administrador de tareas\n*\ncomo ya dije antes que el juego se vea graficamente mejor resalta cosas que hace 10 a\u00f1os dej\u00e1bamos pasar sin fijarnos mucho y vamos de nuevo con las caras pero ahora CINEM\u00c1TICAS IN GAME cuando los personajes hablan muchas veces vemos como sus bocas no se mueven (y repito esto no era nada hace 10 a\u00f1os pero tras tanto tiempo podr\u00eda y deber\u00eda haberse cambiado) no obstante las bocas si se mueven cuando hay un primer plano de su cara (otraves salvo iyoten y asta al principio del juego)\n*\nel peor punto para mi y en eso tengo que darle la raz\u00f3n a un usuario que le\u00ed\nel peor punto de todo el juego sin duda es la AUN carencia de traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol \nya ni siquiera pido doblaje solo con que los subt\u00edtulos y los men\u00fas est\u00e9n BIEN TRADUCIDOS AL ESPA\u00d1OL eso basta\nvan cosa de 10 a\u00f1os desde la saga G.U. tiempo mas que muy suficiente para subtitular y hasta doblar los juegos \nMAS con esta clase de juegos en los que la historia es mucho mas que el juego en si es una lastima ya que esto ayudar\u00eda much\u00edsimo a su venta (lo cual va a hacer que la franquicia hack/animes/juegos terminen vi\u00e9ndose opacados y dejados atr\u00e1s por SWORD ART ONLINE cosa que me hace odiarlos mucho mucho mucho de verdad muerte a kirito xD)\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\n//LO BUENO//\n//Resumen para los que ya jugaron GU 1,2 y 3 en su \u00e9poca//\nla fluidez del juego se mejoro incluso mas all\u00e1 de lo que era su tercer entrega\nse agregaron desde el vol1 llamar a los compa\u00f1eros de party con el LB o L1 (cosa que si no me equivoco era de vol 2 o 3)\nla party ya sale a patear chims desde el volumen 1 (se agradece)\nla party ahora no conforme con patear chims va a correr a los lucky animals\nse mejoro al parecer la IA de la party para defenderse y de algunos enemigos con escudo que ahora se mantienen defendiendo en caso que lo bombardees con golpes\nel limitador de CHIMS subi\u00f3 de 99 A 999 (que se agradece infinito) ya saben por el mecha grunty y las puertas\nRESUMEN desde el primer juego se nota una mejora muy grande tanto gr\u00e1fica como en fluidez algunos se llevaran una sorpresa recibiendo mails casi al principio de juego (por donde atoli nos pide ir a 1000 oak\u00b4s)\n\nPARA LOS QUE NUNCA JUGARON\nes un juego con una historia muy bien echa de principio a fin con personajes muy caracter\u00edsticos que evolucionan mediante la historia avanza una calidad gr\u00e1fica buena (es un remaster bien echo pero tampoco se esperen ac\u00e1 un black desert o algo as\u00ed) \nuna jugabilidad bastante decente fluida y f\u00e1cil (en ocaciones puede ser muy f\u00e1cil)\nel juego (haber no jugu\u00e9 el 4 ni el nuevo de parody pero por lo menos el 1,2 y3) tienen muchos secretos tanto jefes como personajes\nel juego esta mas que completo ya que no solo es un remaster de los primeros 3 hack//G.U sino que tambi\u00e9n contiene el terminal disc el volumen 4 y un nuevo modo parody(que de momento desconozco totalmente su funci\u00f3n)\nla banda sonora los va a llevar de la mano de momentos muy \u00e9picos llenos de emoci\u00f3n y mucha mucha epicidad sin duda uno de los puntos mas fuertes si no es el mas fuerte de toda la saga HACK//anime/juegos\ncomo dije el juego esta completo y cerrado al vaci\u00f3 SIN CAJITAS ALEATORIAS NI ESAS COSAS QUE EXPRIMEN TU BILLETERA\n(por ultimo quer\u00eda decir muerte a kirito larga vida a dot.Hack)\n*******************************************************************************************************************************\nPESE A LO MALO RECOMIENDO ESTE JUEGO POR SU GRAN CANTIDAD DE COSAS BUENAS NOMBRADAS ANTERIORMENTE AUNQUE NO ME MOLESTA QUIEN NO LO RECOMIENDE POR NO TENER SIQUIERA SUBT\u00cdTULOS EN ESPA\u00d1OL ME PARECE UNA RAZ\u00d3N MAS

Then .hack//G.U. Last Recode might just be for you! This remaster of a classic series is like a wet dream for most people who played the original on the PS2, and understandably so since this series is absolutely amazing! For this review, I will go over the pros and cons of the game that I have greatly enjoyed thus far.\n\n(At this point, I would say a joke like \"LINK START\" to get this review rolling since they're both about MMOs, but that's unoriginal at this point and SAO isn't really good, so oh well.)[/i]\n\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\n\n[h1]+ \u1d18\u0280\u1d0f\ua731[/h1]\n\n\n[h1]+ Characters[/h1]\n//One of the many great things about this series is the characters within it. It's weird that they are NPCs who are being portrayed as actuals players, but once you get used to that then it won't really bother you. Each character is unique with their own personality whether it's the friend who loves to observe the beauty around her and help her friends out, the twins sharing an account who act like total opposites, or the online ladiesman going out with people who are quite possibly guys crossplaying as girls. As for the character development, it's pretty incredible! Remember shows like SAO where the main character never really changes/develops as the show goes on? Lots of shows and games have been doing that recently and it gets pretty boring, but in Haseo's case he goes through TONS of development as the story goes on and it's a great change of pace to be quite honest.\n\n[h1]+ Graphics[/h1]\n//Even on the PS2, the graphics (especially in the cutscenes) were pretty good, but to have a remastered version of this come out is like a dream come true for the longtime fans of this series! When comparing the PS2 version with the Steam/PS4 versions, the difference is like night and day; the newer version is better in just about every way possible! Also, the system requirements aren't too demanding. I managed to get the game running smoothly on my laptop [u][url=https://www.cnet.com/products/dell-inspiron-3558-15-6-core-i3-5015u-4-gb-ram-1-tb-hdd-english/specs/](Dell Inspiron 3558)[/url][/u] although I really had to tweak with the settings for it to work out... Nevertheless, I managed to get it working well.\n\n[h1]+ Soundtrack[/h1]\n//To say the least, this game has an amazing soundtrack! I love how it can be relaxing at places like the desktop and then can get intense/energetic in fights, especially in boss battles or in the Arena. The game has a great variety of songs that really helps for setting the mood which is something I appreciate for a heavily story-based game. (I couldn't find a video featuring the whole soundtrack, so this'll have to do.)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy0KGY7DKCM\n\n[h1]+ Story[/h1]\n//The story is definetly one of the games greatest selling points! It's suprisingly deep and is very consistent with it being based off of an \"online game\" and all. You'd expect it to be boring, but with how things play out at the start (especially within the first few cutscenes), I can guarantee that a good number of people will be interested with how the story plays out. (Also, for those new to the series, there's an [u][url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/873/hack__Roots]anime[/url][/u] that goes through the events before the start of Vol.//1, which definetly adds some more depth to the story. There's also manga revealing who Haseo is in real life, but that's not absolutely necessary to check out.) And with the addition of a fourth volume that's exclusive to Steam and PS4, it'll be especially worth the price!\n\n//In short, if you want a game with a great story filled with tons of emotion that'll last for +100 hours, then I would highly recommend you check this game out.\n\n\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\n\n\n[h1]- \u1d04\u1d0f\u0274\ua731[/h1]\n\n\n[h1]- Combat[/h1]\n//While the combat can be fun for some people, it's definetly not the reason people love this game as much as they do. It picks up as the game goes on, but it can still be repetitive and boring for most people. Combat mostly consists of Haseo using multiple weapons such as dual swords, a great sword that's like a chain saw, a scythe, dual-weilding guns, etc. Each weapon has one combo through mashing one button and also has a charge attack which deals a great amount of damage. The most interesting mechanics are that you can freely switch between these weapons in a fight and each weapon has their own set of skills that can be used at any time as long as the player has enough SP to activate it. However, you only unlock these skills by using that specific weapon through battles overtime. I personally didn't mind the combat and still found it to be quite fun, but I just thought I'd bring this up since the combat isn't quite for everyone.\n\n[h1]- Level Designs[/h1]\n//Even though the graphics and the backgrounds surrounding the maps are quite amazing, the designs for the dungeons are pretty stale. They seem pretty uninspired since they mostly consist of boxes and large amounts of straight lines for the level's layout. As for the hub world, it's nowhere near as bad as the dungeons but it could be better in my opinion. There's a good amount of things to do and places to buy items in the town, but I feel as if a lot of the alleys are a little too.... empty. I just wish that there were more things going on around the towns. \n\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\n\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\n//If you want a great story but value a games level designs and combat system, then this is a [u]7 through 9/10[/u] depending on how you look at it. However, if you don't mind the inconsistencies and focus mainly on the captivating story, then this game is easily a [u]10/10[/u]. It's a solid port for an amazing series and that's something all fans should be thankful for. After having waited for this remaster to come out for a while, I can safely say that it was well worth the wait.\n\n\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501", "timestamp_created": 1509949643, "timestamp_updated": 1511402074, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.746717", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36315757": {"recommendationid": "36315757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049010333", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510119530}, "language": "english", "review": "I played the GU series back when in the PS2 version, and I am primarily getting this for the nostalgia.

On one hand I absolutely adore the .hack series and was really excited when I heard about a remastered version was coming out on Steam. But on the other. . . I'm very unimpressed with this port. Don't misundertand, it boots up and doesn't crash and the graphics resolution is clearly way better than it was on PS2 but just about everything with this \"remastered\" version screams laziness. The interface is so wonky and not at all designed for a PC and getting back to the main game menu requires restarting the game. Incredibly stupid way to go about things since that's the only way you can change the game to match your screen resolution or activate V-Sync and Jesus are you going to need it. Without V-sync this game tears like crazy. Also, so many of the game asssets weren't upgraded at all when it comes to thier texture resolution. On top of all this if you plug in a controller you have to use an Xbox controller since a play station controller just doesn't work at all. In addition the controller will just randomly stop working and you will have to use keyboard and mouse again and only restarting the game will get the controller to work. Another problem in terms of visuals is the god damned cutscenes, which were not reworked at all, will run fine and then slow to a crawl randomly. No clue why this is happening. I've got a pretty high end rig so this kind of performance dip just makes no sense at all. Very poorly optimized and, overall, it looks like CC2 just went for a quick cash grab with very little effort whatsoever put into making this for PC gamers. So if you have already played the .hack series and have the Ps2 disks . . . use pcsx2 emulator and play them on your PC it will run way better in my experience although you will have to fiddle with the settings to get it just right. If you've never played the series before and don't have a ps2 then this isn't that bad and you might find it to be an amazing game with perhaps a few frustrating caveats with the interface.\n\nEdit: The issue with accessing the steam settings was not well explained on my part. You can get to the title menu from within the game but for whatever reason you cannot change the settings without a restart in my case. Not sure why, hopefully a patch will come out that solves that inconvenience.", "timestamp_created": 1509937057, "timestamp_updated": 1509955319, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.376053", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36313146": {"recommendationid": "36313146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035500170", "num_games_owned": 764, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 11613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1721, "last_played": 1515399002}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Quantos anos n\u00e3o esperei por isso, poder jogar um dos meus jogos favoritos no PC sem precisar de gambiarra de emulador e ainda com gr\u00e1ficos atualizados, pra quem j\u00e1 conhecia e quer relembrar esse grande jogo recomendo o remaster esta excelente.\n\nPara a galera nova pode ser dif\u00edcil gostar, no fim \u00e9 o mesmo jogo do PS2 com alguns upgrades gr\u00e1ficos e de mecanica, por\u00e9m ainda \u00e9 bem parecido e por isso pode acabar sendo ma\u00e7ante para algu\u00e9m jogando pela primeira vez, por\u00e9m a hist\u00f3ria e os personagens s\u00e3o muito bons, se isso j\u00e1 serve para te prender recomendo.  \n\nWelcome to The World!

:p , and the Extra content from Collector editions and what you got in the PS2 version if you imported from a clear save in Quarantine, is nice toop (and that we get localized Parody Mode videos! :D wish they would of added in and localized GU Triliogy's Parody mode :p )\n\nand a side note for UK players or anyone that's forgotten what spell does what until you hit Vol 2, http://dothack.wikia.com/wiki/Spells this is a list of everything from The World R1(Infection~Quarantine) and R2 (GU)\n\nGood luck to everyone out there and just.. dont call Pi an old Hag.", "timestamp_created": 1509904842, "timestamp_updated": 1509904842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548837", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36304517": {"recommendationid": "36304517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198420072796", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514429042}, "language": "english", "review": "so im playing the game and getting into it, and i realize that the game is incredibly laggy. even after redoing the graphics it still has a slow frame rate. its almost as if they took an emulator, cleaned it up and put it on steam.", "timestamp_created": 1509904262, "timestamp_updated": 1509904262, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.299469", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36304314": {"recommendationid": "36304314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038093871", "num_games_owned": 496, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512451347}, "language": "english", "review": "Really awesome port of a really awesome game series", "timestamp_created": 1509903757, "timestamp_updated": 1509903757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553994", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36304183": {"recommendationid": "36304183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071989486", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509807725}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Foi um dos melhores jogos no \u00faltimo suspiro do PS2,\nmas infelizmente eu acabei pegando reembolso pq eu queria manter essa mem\u00f3ria,\no jogo ficou muito defasado, s\u00f3 um remake salvaria.....e n\u00e3o um remaster 4k.\nAinda assim, eu recomendo pq o problema \u00e9 comigo...n\u00e3o o jogo.", "timestamp_created": 1509903398, "timestamp_updated": 1509903398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591549", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36304056": {"recommendationid": "36304056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092676810", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511111502}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u671f\u5f85\u5df2\u4e45\u7684\u590d\u523b\u7ec8\u4e8e\u51fa\u4e86\uff0c\u5c0f\u65f6\u5019PS2\u73a9\u76d7\u7248\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u7b2c\u4e09\u7ae0\u6700\u540e\u7ed3\u5a5a\u5361\u6ca1\u770b\u61c2\u778e\u9001\u4e86\uff08\u6ca1\u5237\u6ee1\u597d\u611f\u88ab\u597d\u4eba\u5361\u4e86...\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u6709\u4e86\u518d\u7248\u7ec8\u4e8e\u80fd\u5f25\u8865\u5c0f\u65f6\u5019\u7684\u9057\u61be\u4e86\n\u6e38\u620f10.0/10\u5206\n-1\u5206\u7ed9\u6e38\u620f\u64cd\u4f5c\u624b\u611f\u4f9d\u7136\u8fd8\u662f\u90a3\u6837\u8fdf\u949d\n-1\u5206\u6e38\u620f\u867d\u8bf4\u662f\u5927\u4f53\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6e05\u7248\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4eba\u7269\u548c\u573a\u666f\u9ad8\u6e05\u540e\u5efa\u6a21\u4f9d\u7136\u4e0d\u592a\u597d\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u753b\u8d28\u4f9d\u7136\u6709\u68f1\u6709\u89d2\u7684= =\uff09\n+2\u5206\u51fa\u4e86\u7b2c\u56db\u7ae0\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u8fd8\u6ca1\u73a9\u5230\uff08\u6b63\u5728\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ae0\u63a8\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u662fPS2\u65f6\u671f\u771f\u7684\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u770b\u5230\u5fd7\u4e43\u548cOvan\u7684\u540e\u7eed\u5267\u60c5", "timestamp_created": 1509903074, "timestamp_updated": 1509903074, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565916", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36303181": {"recommendationid": "36303181", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014666590", "num_games_owned": 1220, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511019613}, "language": "english", "review": "Being European, I'm just so happy to finally be able to play the G.U. part of a series I love.

Interacting random NPCs as if they were players in the MMO, seeing world news events, interacting with forum posts as the games main way of being a wikipedia. It just oozes atmosphere with this believable MMO world. The story also keeps you interested with probably the best character development of any JRPG you're ever going to play.

[/h1]\n\n\n[b] Intro to .hack//Franchise [/b]\nFor those unfamiliar with the .hack (or dot hack) franchise, I'll start with a basic, spoiler-free introduction. Dot Hack is a now 15 year old multimedia franchise with books, graphic novels, anime, and games, regarding a fictional MMO known simply as The World. This franchise started in the early 2000's, just following the early days of MMOs, inspired by titles such as Ultima Online and Everquest, successful MMOs before World of Warcraft popularized the genre in a more mainstream level.\n\nEach entry in dot hack tells a self-contained story about the fictional MMO and covers topics pertinent to online interactions, online indentities vs. real identities, identity politics, virtual reality, social media, urban legends, and so on. Very forward-thinking for a series conceptualized in the early 2000s. Each entry is also fairly self-contained, not necessarily requiring someone to pay attention to every book, game, anime, or movie to understand the one they are currently on, although consuming more of the franchise does paint a wider picture. It's kind of like Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear franchise in that way.\n\n[b] On to .hack//GU: Last Recode [/b]\n\nThis game is a remastered package of .hack//GU, a trilogy of action RPGs for the Playstation 2 console. It is the second series of games in the .hack//Franchise but this is an ideal package to start with. The reason why is that it contains a series of 'Terminal' videos that explain the events of the first game series, so while it's not a replacement for sorely needed remasters or remakes of those games, it's a great alternative to ponying up $200-300 for that series, as it's been long out of print. The videos covering the first games are not necessary to watch for .hack//GU but it provides some extra context and lore for those who care.\n\nAs for the game itself, from my experience so far it is a competent port. Not a lot of options on this PC version, but it runs well at seemingly a locked resolution of 60 frames per second, ideal for any high-motion action game. The graphics are way better and less muddy than the PS2 originals, although obviously polygons are still obvious, especially on rounded objects. The style of the graphics are in a cel-shaded style, however, so that aspect has not aged as poorly. You can jump into any Volume you want, including a new 4th Volume created specifically for this remastered set. There is also a parody mode I have no experience with yet, but it allegedly contains spoilers and is not meant for anyone who hasn't completed the games.\n\nThe gameplay of .hack//GU: Last Recode is a story-driven action role-playing game, framed as an MMO. You have 'servers' which function as hub towns and another parameter to keep in mind for dungeons. Dungeons are accessed through key words acquired through your player character's emails, the message boards of the world, or story events, and the dungeons generated with the key words change from server to server, so trying the same word combination in different servers will give you different dungeons to complete.\n\nThe Server hub worlds themselves are filled with shops, quests, events, and NPCs that roam around as if they were player characters in an MMO, and you can trade with them. A lot of effort was made to try and immerse you in the idea that you're in an MMO. The combat in dungeons is honestly very simple; one attack button, a block button, and skill triggers. It plays out like a basic brawler with repetitive combos. Do not expect depth of gameplay akin to Dark Souls. Dungeons are generated with differing objectives, but honestly from my memory it's just different floor layouts of maybe 3-5 specific types of dungeons with different aesthetic tile sets as you go along to at least change up the visuals from time to time.\n\nIf there's two things that make this game (and usually, the entire franchise is strong in these regards), it's the story and the music. If you read my summary of the franchise, the story part wouldn't be too much of a surprise. It holds up pretty well with the topics and themes presented in the plot of these games becoming more and more relevant over the years. Again, I must compare the story to Metal Gear. Specifically, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, except with less pseudo-politics on a national scale. The music is very well-composed and catchy in GU, a large improvement over the soundtrack in the original dot hack games in my opinion. Not as stellar as the soundtrack for the first anime, .hack//SIGN, though, but it fits the action of the game well.\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\n\nIf any of what I have said sounds appealing to you, I would say that this package is worth the price of admission as it is at $50. Previously, the games were only on PS2 with no ports to other systems, and physical copies long out of print and produced in limited numbers in the United States, where I live. Saying that, before this I was only ever able to get the first two volumes, and a complete set nowadays of the physical copies would set you back over $100, WITHOUT the extra volume, Terminal videos recapping the original (also rare) $300 .hack//Games, new stuff like the Parody mode, difficulty options, and upgraded visuals. All that said, you could argue this is a way to get roughly $400 value of previously hard to acquire content at the much cheaper price tag of $50. Although I would still very much like it if Bandai-Namco and CyberConnect2 would just invest in remaking the original dot hack game series already.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I would say wait for the eventual steam sales to take their course until you feel ready to take the plunge. This series has a long history and can be overwhelming for newcomers, so buying it on a sale is much less of a risk if you are unsure. As a fan of this often-ignored franchise I would definitely reccommend everyone to give it a try eventually.

EDIT: VERY STORY HEAVY. [/h1]\n\nThe soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful and does a wonderful job supporting story immersion.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly simple with an emphasis on patience and timing. It takes a little bit to get through earlier stages but the combat opens up the more options you unlock as Haseo levels.\n\nStory is one of the main reasons I enjoyed this series so much the first time. The characters may be a little anime-tropish but they are definitely lovable and engaging. There are also a good number of supporting characters that come and go throughout the series that each have distinct personalities.\n\n[b] Overall, I would definitely recommend this for someone looking for a deep story experience and relatively simple gameplay. [/b] If you've played these games before, then you know you will enjoy them again. Also the price for all of these is perfect, especially considering how much it costs to buy the physical PS2 discs.

I played a large portion of PS2 games, but I was never able to find a copy of these.\n\nI plan on updating my review as time goes on, as this review would have to cover what this product is in it's entirety, and that spans four games.\n\nCurrently I'm 5 hours into the first game, and I have to admit, I'm horribly bored. I bought it because I've always heard a ton of great things about the game, but thus far it's been 90% cutscenes, and I feel like after five hours the story is moving, but I just haven't done anything. I can't even do any side quests yet until I progress further, aside from the first one. I'm sticking with it in the hopes that it picks up, by the second game at the very least.\n\nAs it currently stands thus far into the game, I have no problem with the visuals, as I feel they have been updated very nicely. Gameplay is pretty standard for what I'd expect and the game runs fabulously. However, as I have yet to be able to enjoy myself, I'll have to give the game a thumbs down at this point in time. If there was a neutral button, I would definitely choose that option, but I cannot give it a thumbs up at this point in time. Really hoping it picks up, though. I enjoy the cutscenes, for what they're worth.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo, as of now I have about 24 hours into the game and have completed the first of the four games bundled. I still hold onto what was stated above, and the first 5-6 hours of the game felt dragged out and awfully slow. In about that time I think I actually played the game a total of ten minutes. Having never played this game before, and not having the nostalgia many others are basing their reviews off of, it was pretty difficult to force myself through the beginning of the first game. however, shortly after that 6 hour mark you get thrusted into the Arena and the game finally lets you free and I had an absolute blast.\n\nThe game mechanics, though outdated, were still fun and engaging regardless of how many times I repeated the same thing (in perfect MMO fashion). The whole \"online aspect\" of the game was a wonderful experience, and seeing how modern the game is despite coming out over a decade ago really shows the vision that went into this. They basically predicted current online play to a T. Building relationships and watching the characters grow and bond was a great experience, I just wish they could have blend the combat and cutscenes together better to make it more enjoyable.\nAnother negative thing I found about the first game is how frustratingly easy it was. Before I was even halfway through the game I was already capped at 50 basically one-shotting everything. To a degree it was my fault, but I didn't realize how quickly I would level up or how quick the level cap would approach.\n\nI've just begun the second game and I have to admit, I am thoroughly excited to see where this goes.

Oh man, I spent so much of my childhood running Kite and Blackrose through dungeons on my old PS2, that to have the chance of playing the GU series is a true joy that resonates with me. This remastered of the three GU games is excellent. Playing on a 4k TV, I am able to see the difference between this and the PS2 versions like night and day. Movies are smooth and the controller inputs feel crisp.\n\nOne negative I have is the speed of the game seems to have been amped to X1.25. Its okay because alot of times you're running and it certainly gets you there quicker but  yeah its noticeable. This is only in free run situations, dialogue and movies are normal, or else they'd sound like chipmonks. I also had trouble initially with frame rate stuttering but I had to assign my Graphics card to handle the game application v integrated video chip.\n\nDefinitely recommend this series to veterans of the original games and to those who have had the GU series before.

At its core, its a faux MMORPG, and it nails this perfectly....especially when you consider how old the title is....and creates a great single player experience.\n\nThis release should be treated as both a beloved franchise and a potential fundraiser for future titles from the same developer. Is it debateable whether the original 4 dotHack games were more deserving of a remaster (I personally believed them to be the better games, but to each their own), regardless this titles success and early adoption by consumers will help fund its port and further new titles.\n\nIn short I fully recommend this game. Its aged like a fine wine, sure its a little grindy, but most JRPGs are, and with potential mod support....well the future looks bright for this game.

I have criticisms of the first four games (.hack Infection, Mutation, Outbreak and Quarantine) mostly for being so stale and grindy. That being said, this is a detail-oriented review that seeks to answer questions like \"Do I need to play the original series to understand this one?\" So if you don't enjoy walls of text or you just want a direct review of THIS game ONLY, skip it.\n\nThe game has a complex story, so I'll try to simplify it.\n\nMild story spoilers ahead.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nIf you haven't played a .hack game before, this is a great place to start. The game includes an \"OS Terminal\" that has a bunch of videos which will catch new players up with what they missed in the first four PS2 games, and while they're a bit slow and tedious to sit through, it sure as hell beats buying the original games for about $400 collectively and spending 2 weeks grinding through the story.\n\n.hack//G.U. is an offline, single-player game that emulates the atmosphere and features of an actual MMORPG. It was designed back in 2006 for players that wanted an online game but couldn't justify paying $15 a month to play. It emulates a lot of the aesthetic of early Everquest stylings while also adding more modern sci-fi/hacking themes. If you like anything cyberpunk or futuristic mixed with high-fantasy medieval tones, you'll love .hack//G.U.\n\nFor clarification, the G.U. series on PS2 had 3 parts: Volume 1: Rebirth, Volume 2: Reminisce, and Volume 3: Redemption, which is a sequel to the IMOQ series mentioned above. This version, Last Recode, not only remastered the original PS2 series, it actually ADDED Volume 4 that included cut content from the original final game, complete with returning voice actors, new abilities/story quests and so on. It's kind of mind-blowing that a publisher would ADD NEW CONTENT to an old niche PS2 game and remaster it for current-gen consoles and PCs. That fact alone is worth the price of admission.\n\nThe story is very enigmatic and dramatic. I love cheesy anime drama stories, but this game takes it to the next level. There's a lot of screaming, death, romance, revenge, and everything else you might expect from a typical shounen anime. As a 16-year-old back in the day, this was really cool to me. As an adult, I acknowledge all the cliche's but I still love it.\n\nIn the original .hack PS2 series, the protagonist player named Kite logged in to play an MMO known plainly as \"The World\" (this was before all the cancerous Jojo memes, for the record) with his friend Yasuhiko who controls his character named Orca, a high-level and famous player. After a basic tutorial and a run-through of the combat and dungeon, Kite and Orca suddenly get teleported to an area where a mysterious white-haired, angelic-looking girl named Aura hands him an item called the Book of Twilight. She vanishes and a monster appears known as \"Skeith,\" whom uses an ability on Orca known as \"Data Drain,\" which kills him and puts Yasuhiko into a coma. Kite gets teleported out of the battleground thanks to the help of a hacker known as Helba, and he remarks that he doesn't know what happened to his friend, as he vows to explore the mysteries hidden within the world.\n\nAs he searches deeply for clues as to why a game can put a real life person into a coma, he looks to the forums for help, as he poses the question of whether or not anyone else heard of this coma phenomenon. When he goes back later to check, he finds his post deleted. The game progresses and it becomes clear that the system administrators of the game are aware of the problem but are trying to cover up the truth by censoring any of the discussion about the issue. If you want to find out the rest of the story, there are plenty of story cutscenes available on YouTube as well as within .hack//G.U. Last Recode's files, but if you like murder mystery or psychological horror, you've come to the right place.\n\nWithin the context of the first four games, the fear of that sort of thing happening once again is due to an event known as \"Pluto's Kiss,\" in which a hacker shut down every computer in the world, arming the US's missile defense retaliation system and nearly ending the world before it was stopped at the last second. This is a fictional world in which fear of AI and network security is a very real thing that mirror's our own world's politics. There are news apps that update you on events going on in the real world within the game and multiple parallel stories (such as a documentary series known as \"Online Jack\" that takes place concurrently to the game's events) to give the illusion that this online game is both alive and impactful. In the first 4 games in the series, the games came with a DVD OVA known as \".hack//LIMINALITY\" that also used a concurrent real-life story to supplement the in-game plot; the idea that everything happening in the game is making an impact on the real world in real time - a super interesting concept.\n\n.hack//G.U. takes place after the initial four games, and it's a massive improvement. There's more action, better graphics, more polished voice acting and gameplay. If you feel the need to replay the original series in order to enjoy this one, don't. Aside from some narrative caveats, this is a fully-functioning standalone game that has nods and returning characters from the original series, but you won't miss much if you just watch a recap.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n.hack//G.U. stars a player known as Haseo who starts off as an idealistic youth engulfed with angst and vengeance, and I'll be honest, he's a huge d-bag that most players will find brash, unlikeable, and incredibly toxic. He thinks he's the best, he talks down to people who try to help him, and he's just plain rude. As the game progresses, however, he becomes completely redeemable as he matures in response to the tribulations he faces in The World. His primary motivation is, much like the last game, to unearth the mystery behind his friend Shino being killed by a hacker and put into a coma in real-life, but this time there's romance involved between the two. If you're interested in exploring the preceding events of G.U., check out the anime .hack//Roots, which is a prequel that takes place in the same universe with most of the same characters.\n\nHaseo, like Kite before him, inherits a character with hacking skills. Within the context of the story, you're a hacker playing in a world full of normal, law-abiding players. You're basically a Gary Stu (aka male Mary Sue) who's stronger than everyone and the story revolves around you. Along the way you'll encounter a wide variety of interesting characters, like Sakubo, a player character shared by a timid little brother and a tsundere little sister, Saku and Bo, respectively. When you invite her to your party, there's a 50/50 chance of getting either one. You'll meet Piros the Third, who's actually based on the president of the publishing/developer company CyberConnect2, an eccentric roleplayer who never breaks character and acts incredibly cheesy and overly heroic. You'll meet a large beastman-character named Gabi, who, in real life, is a novelist and retired professor of cultural anthropology, who's so busy that he makes it a habit to respond to questions with only a one-line, several-word response usually accompanied by a smiley face. :) You'll also meet familiar faces from the first game, some of which have gone rogue and become the central antagonists.\n\nI could go on and on and on about this series and why I adore it. The artists and composers are responsible for Ghost in the Shell and Evangelion among other things. If you like this game, watch the anime series. Read the wiki. It's a deep, never-ending mysterious series that treats the player like an intelligent adult.

While the graphics back then weren\u2019t the most impressive (especially from today\u2019s perspective), [u]the game had (or, well.. has!) great cutscenes the players could always return to through in-game cutscenes viewer[/u]. Now both of those are here in high quality! \n\n[u].hack//G.U. takes place in a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game played in virtual reality \u2013 \u201cThe World\u201d. The player takes control of Haseo, an infamous Player Killer Killer known better by the nickname \u201cThe Terror of Death\u201d who is on his search for a character who defeated his dear friend Shino in-game and ended up putting her in coma in real life. A forum fairytale. Tri-Edge.\n\nHaving defeated a hundred PKers who stood against him, he reaches level 133 in game and is powerful enough to take on Tri-Edge. [spoiler]However, there is more to him \u2013 a mysterious computer anomaly AIDA has began appearing inside the world of.. The World and its infections drive people mad with and for power, before draining them of life and putting them in an oh so familiar to Haseo comatose state.[/spoiler][/u]\n\nThe game was released with an anime called .hack//Roots, which puts some background story into the game \u2013 Haseo\u2019s beginnings inside The World, his first guild \u201cTwilight Brigade\u201d and friends like the beloved Shino and mysterious patron Ovan, as well as his rise to becoming the Terror of Death. While useful and pretty interesting, it is not a requirement to watch it prior to playing G.U.\n\nAside from Roots, the .hack universe features a lot of other games (G.U. not being the first in the franchise!), animes, novels and even a CGI movie \u2013 a recreation of all three .hack games.\n\nI keep mentioning three games, so why did I originally mention four parts? Well, [u]Last Recode ships with a brand new part to the trilogy \u2013 Volume 4: Reconnection[/u], which takes place after the end of the game and concerns.. a certain individual. No spoilers. You\u2019ll know who in time~\nAside from Volume 4, there is also a Parody Mode and Terminal Disk - a collection of recordings from a CC Corp programmer who tells the story of the four games that came before G.U. as well as information about the lore on-goings inside the new game world.\n\n---\n\n [b]G.U. is an action RPG with real-time combat taking place in round arenas[/b] \u2013 the players have their basic attack and block functions as well as a list of skill triggers to use at all times. If used at the right time, players may unleash Rengeki \u2013 a boost to damage delivered during a skill trigger and party morale. The game also features a different kind of combat with more shoot \u2018em up elements. As it is an RPG, there are plenty of items for Haseo and his party to use \u2013 from items and weapons to spells. Haseo is a class called the Adept Rogue, so [u]he is able to switch between a few different weapon \u2013 his weapons of choice are Twin Blades, a (chainsaw) Broadsword and a Scythe.[/u]\n\nAside from the aforementioned elements, there is a world outside of the World \u2013 though not outside of the computer. [u]You are able to log out of the game and access your e-mail, news site articles & videos, web forums, browse fan art of in-game things or play a card minigame! This is also the menu where you access the cutscenes you have unlocked so far. It might seem minor, but it\u2019s a really cool and immersive thing to log out and browse through messages about how badass the last Arena fight was or how they heard rumours about various events \u2013 it truly makes the world feel alive.[/u]\n\n---\n\n[b]Performance?[/b] I have a rather [u]mediocre laptop with a GeForce 940MX, Intel Core i5-7200U, 8GBs of RAM and a really terrible HDD[/u] - so bad the entire computer can freeze up when downloading things. [u]I can play the game pretty fine with 30-50FPS without any sudden major drops.\n However, some parts of the games are a bit choppy[/u] - animations seem to scale with FPS, so the lower it is the slower Haseo will run, or the more out of sync the audio will be during cutscene close-ups (not the main CGI cutscenes, but little animations that sometimes appear in various convos, usually include lipsync). As the computer I'm using is not the best (940MX being more or less the equivalent of GTX 740, I believe?), the above might be better on other machines.\n\n--\n\nOne shameful thing is that the [b]graphical upgrade wasn't as thorough as it could be[/b]. At some points the game just looks weird because of the lower quality models, faces don't move most of the time outside of cutscenes - in fact, more effort seems to have been spent on upgrading those rather than the actual game bits themselves. Also there's a bunch of clipping here and there.\n\n---\n\n[b]Big plus for the game\u2019s soundtrack \u2013 a definite strong part of the series![/b] Some of my favourite pieces are Gentle Hands (existing both in [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJwy-Fi1NT8]Japanese[/url] and [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHcrj_44Hq4]English![/url]), [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG47XOiNlKQ]Terror of Death[/url], [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MW8IHfhuLA]Everything in These Hands[/url] and [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mD2dnwgpYCA]Serpent of Lore[/url].\n\n---------\n\nThere might be bits of nostalgia behind my words, but considering through those ten years I regularly returned to the .hack Wiki and cutscenes uploaded to YouTube as well as replayed the game a few times using emulators, I think [b]I can bravely say .hack//G.U. is a wonderful game one should look into [/b] \u2013 especially if you\u2019re already interested in anime or Japanese RPGs, as those will only help you get into it.\n\n\n[h1][b][u]TL;DR - A story definitely worth experiencing, but the port isn't

I've played for just over 3 hours and it remains true to what it was with some slight differences.\n\nSome technical nitpicking is that, for me, the game seems to run slightly faster than it did when I played it on the PS2 (I feel a bit uncomfortable with it).

The difficulty is a bit too easy from what I remember though. \nONE BIG PROBLEM I HAVE NOTICED is that the game tends to SOFTLOCK RANDOMLY. That is unacceptable that I am playing my rpg game and then I have to turn off my computer and lose all my progress because the game soft locked so until that is patched my review is changing to negative. I cannot recommend this rpg if people will END UP WASTING THEIR TIME BECAUSE IT SOFTLOCKS ON THEM.\nEdit 12/22/17\nSo the game hasn't softlocked on me in a really long time so I am going to assume that it has been fixed.

I never had the chance to play vol 2 and 3 because of the price years after it went rare. I had beaten vol 1 a few times back on the ps2 years ago. When this release was first announced I was nothing but excited to get my money's worth. \n\nThe quality of the game feels really good and smooth. The combat is pretty straightforward and simple with a one button attack but you get additional skills to execute. Additionally, you also have recovery attacks for more strategy if I may say so. It doesn't sound fun from words alone but it is when you have your hands in control of the game. Gameplay allows you to do general things you'd expect from an actual mmo like guild management, arena, improve gears questing etc.. The game isn't complex by any means. It's straightforward fun as a game should be.\n\n.Hack GU has a great narrative that give reason to invest time in the game. There is more than enough cutscenes to entertain the story and develop the characters. Furthermore, the fictional forums the game provides in its internet sphere offers branching narratives and lore to the world of .Hack in game and the real world. The game was ahead of its time tackling issues relevant today about technology when it becomes too much a part of our lives not just for a solution but more so for convenience (which you would have to read in the in game forum). It also makes you feel like you are in a forum with people discussing these topics like in real people. But even if you don't read them, the narrative will allude to these things or some characters will mention them.\n\nThere are some minor pop in issues in open fields which can be annoying as well as the LOD for distance in the outside maps. It is less of an issue in closed areas.

Honestly this collection is targeted more towards players who already played the games and watched the animes back when it first came out years ago than towards JRPG lovers.

The story, the characters, the themes, etc. \n\nI wouldn't recommend this collection to anyone who already grew out from their love for animes targeted towards teenagers such as myself. Only bought it to relive my nostalgia. Was it as good as I remembered it? Nope.\n\nFunny how back then I thought Haseo was among the coolest guys in anime but seeing him with adult eyes now makes him look stubborn, selfish, arrogant and filled with teenage angst.

The technical side of things is fairly simple. Controls are serviceable when using a controller (This was a PS2 game after all), though I cannot speak for the quality of using a keyboard and mouse. Graphics options, language options and everything you could want are present. Which is especially nice since there was no way to change from English to Japanese voices in the original. Performance-wise, the game holds up well and does not suffer from slowdowns of any kind on my system. Furthermore, the graphics have been updated to look nice and crisp even on fancy digital displays, which cannot be said for any emulated version. Or even the original PS2 game on a new LCD TV.\n\nNow for the story and gameplay. For people not familiar with the series, it's a typical JRPG with a twist. Rather than being an adventurer thwarting evil you are a player in a simulated MMO in which shady happenings seem to be putting people into comas. The premise can be seen as a sort of inspiration for the later Sword Art Online. Battles, however, are more action-focused than one would usually expect in an MMO and actually feel rather rewarding. Especially when you go to an area above your level and solo fights you should not be able to win. \nFor veterans of the series, various quality of life improvements were made, such as porting features from the later volumes even to Rebirth, like the sped-up Chim kicking animation (Which was a real deal breaker when replaying Vol 1. Rebirth on PS2) and the trilogy feels a lot more consistent as a result.\n\nI can only fully recommend this game to anyone even vaguely interested in the premise or just PS2 era JRPGs in general.", "timestamp_created": 1521146420, "timestamp_updated": 1521146420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40829781": {"recommendationid": "40829781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182806678", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "last_played": 1520882418}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok Remaster.\nSome problems with the Grapchis for some.\nKinda hard to play without controller.\n\nLove the new additions.\n\nGood Oldie.", "timestamp_created": 1521124511, "timestamp_updated": 1521124511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40807279": {"recommendationid": "40807279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068204347", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 6089, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518394222}, "language": "english", "review": "A complete gem.

series, or want to play the 4th part, go ahead and buy this.  They did an excellent job porting the games to PC and I encountered no issues whatsoever during my time with .hack (hunt around for the v-sync option if you get screen tearing).\n\nThe reason this gets a thumbs down is because the entire experience is an unrewarding slog.  The G.U. trilogy was released in rapid succession back in the day, and it is essentially one game split awkwardly into three parts, with some heavy padding to give each game around a 20-hour runtime.  The battles play out a bit like Star Ocean 3, but they are extremely slow and unrewarding.  The dungeons are long, repetitious, and bland, and feature encounters that are often frequent and hard to avoid.  Apart from the arena area, there are only three hub areas (one for each game).  It's very barebones.\n\nWhile you can start fresh and work your way through each game, carrying your save data along the way, it is also possible to enable a cheat mode to max your character out so you can breeze through the story.  The story features a novel concept:  you play as a person who is playing a character in a fictional online game called The World.  The idea is that various problems in the game are spilling over into real life, causing users to fall into comas and so on.  It's cool, but the delivery is terrible.  Because there isn't too much of it to go around, the story is presented at a glacial pace.  What you end up getting a lot of the time is segments about how the game is more than just a game, or about how mysterious everything is.  The pacing is just awful.\n\nIt also needs to be said that the game is ridiculously cheesy even when it's trying to take itself seriously.  The characters, their lines, and a lot of what happens is hilarious or overacted to the point of absurdity.  Sometimes it's fun, but it's often as not just plain bad.    The concept is great and some of the characters were neat, but it's not enough to save the games from being terrible.", "timestamp_created": 1519806130, "timestamp_updated": 1519806130, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40449651": {"recommendationid": "40449651", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971471023", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517289164}, "language": "english", "review": "Ahhh, .Hack...

The voise acting in both languages is supurb, the graphics are decent enough for the time it was made, the fighting can feel a little repetetive, but it has enough flare to keep things interesting, especially when you get to being able to swap between weapon sets.

played the first three for the nostalgia of playing them again. Just don't do like I did and use cheat mode to blast through the first 3 volumes to relive the story to remember stuff, expecting the 4th volume to be a full fledged game. The 4th volume is so damn short, and so damn easy, it honestly just feels like a someone wrote a fanfic. The characters that you come to know and love all get pushed to the side and you can't really enjoy them at all.

Also keep in mind, I have never played a .Hack game before Last Recode, so these thoughts are from someone who is completely new to the series, and currently, one who has only finished volume 1, so my thoughts here will reflect these points.\n\nSo, first, the story, as it is clearly the best part of the game. The story is fantastic, at first, I was iffy on it, but after much encouragment from a friend who is a huge fan of the series, and a bit of time away from it (Mostly due to life and other games in my backlog, you know, the usual) it grew on me, and if you like great characters, the story and the characters will grow on you too.\n\nNext, I want to talk about the combat, as frankly, it's probably the weakest aspect of the game in my opinion. [spoiler]Haseo[/spoiler], who is the protagonist, starts off with access to just one weapon; dual swords. While you do gain access to another weapon type in volume 1, most of the game you are stuck with only dual swords, which almost made me drop the game, and likely would have if it weren't for the fact that my friend praised the game so much. Yes, dual swords are that bad in my opinion. However, at a certain part of the story, you do what is called a [spoiler]\"job extension\"[/spoiler] quest which grants you access to [spoiler]broadsword, the superior of the two weapons in my opinion.[/spoiler]\n\nNow from what I hear, volume 2's combat, especially the dual swords, improve quite a bit, so i'm looking forward to that.\n\nNow let's get into some of the nitpicks I have with the game, that while don't prevent me from playing it, are just a few things I feel could be improved on, to make the game as a whole, a more cohesive, or more enjoyable experience.\n\n-Whenever Haseo talks, typically about what needs to be done next to progress, you are unable to move until the resulting text box is gone, which you have to clear with the press of the button, which makes it rather jarring and feel sluggish when the objective changes frequently.\n\n-The lack of an option for PlayStation button icons is a bizarre choice as the originals were on PS2, and the game came out on PC and PS4 on the same day. While this won't affect those who use keyboard and mouse, or an XBox controller, this will affect those who uses PlayStation controllers. Why you may ask? Well [spoiler]Sometimes in fields, dungeons, etc., you will come across trap chests, which you basically \"disarm\" by inputting the buttons that show up[/spoiler] and if you're using a PS controller, you'll be given XBox icons, so unless you have those memorized, you will likely have trouble with this. However, there are mods to put in PS icons, but installing them can be a bit confusing, and when the assests already exist on the PS4 version, this shouldn't be necessary.\n\n-[spoiler]Having to log out of The World to check emails, and other things, while it does add to the idea that The World is a game, and that its players have a life outside of it, it can be frustrating.[/spoiler] Don't get me wrong, I get it, and I ended up not minding it at the end, but for the longest time, it just annoyed me.\n\nAll in all, as long as you can get past the first bit, for the game to really get going, it is absolutely worth buying, and I look forward to continuing with volume 2.", "timestamp_created": 1519380459, "timestamp_updated": 1519380459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40323526": {"recommendationid": "40323526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110066008", "num_games_owned": 919, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511658350}, "language": "english", "review": "My childhood in one awesome package.", "timestamp_created": 1519379924, "timestamp_updated": 1519379924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460829", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40321091": {"recommendationid": "40321091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121369702", "num_games_owned": 500, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519236662}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0439 JRPG. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0451 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 6,5-7. \u0421\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430. \u042f \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u043d\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0447\u0442\u0430\u043b \u043e\u0431 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435, \u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0451 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u044f \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0445. \u0421\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441, \u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446-\u0442\u043e \u044f \u0435\u0451 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0433 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0438 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0447\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0430 \u0438 \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u0448\u0430\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u043b\u0434\u0441\u0443\u043a\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440 -

Action part of the \"Action RPG\" is spot on, and I'm currently replaying with a controller with a wonky A button.  Not suffering.  At this point, entering the third volume, and while it was a little over my usual price point, I am very happy with the purchase.  Good game.  Good story.  Rating?  Maybe 4.5 out of 5.  Limitations from the original exist.  Can't shut down/skip certain convos I've heard before, remember, don't care about.  Great game if you are intoxicated, and just plain can't deal with RL people.  Only downside to the game:  Culture.  It's a Japanese game, and if you're female you're probably going have some issues with a lot of characters.

Right now I am about 4 hours into the first game. It looks amazing and it plays well when you actually get to play the game. Now let me elaborate on the latter half of that sentence. This game is very cut scene heavy and the majority of the cut scenes are skippable, but if you are like me and haven't played the originals you have to watch them to know whats going on. I don't mind narrative heavy stuff so this doesn't bother me, but I could definitely see it bothering some. I didn't time it out but I would think at this point in the game i've spent about 70% of my time watching cutscenes or reading the news/forums/main and the other 30% actually playing the game. This doesn't bother me but it definitely will bother a lot of people and this game won't satisfy those kinds of gamers. \nOverall I would give the game a 7.5/10 so far but that may get better or worse as I play through the whole series. \n\non a side note I've seen a lot of posts of people having issues running the game, i don't know if there was a patch released right before I bought it but I have not had any technical issues. My pc is 4 years old and runs a 4 gig 770 and a i5 4670k (not currently overclocked) It runs very well and looks great. The only issue I notice is the occasional blury line or 3, but seeing as this series is based on glitches it could be there on purpose, its nothing that messes up actual game play.\n", "timestamp_created": 1519189782, "timestamp_updated": 1519189782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40244256": {"recommendationid": "40244256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018889140", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517660924}, "language": "english", "review": "Bugs Bugs Bugs....skip it imo.", "timestamp_created": 1519107915, "timestamp_updated": 1519107915, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.334912", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40242087": {"recommendationid": "40242087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202703142", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 201, "last_played": 1521673251}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "O pouco que joguei j\u00e1 foi poss\u00edvel notar diversas melhoras, n\u00e3o somente gr\u00e1ficas como tamb\u00e9m na jogabilidade.

To fix this I had to add the borderless windowed options from steam's settings rather than from the in-game settings, then change the game to borderless windowed from in-game afterwards. The second is a crash during combat. A quick search on google seems to have isolated the problem to a particular character, Kuhn, having a skill that was bugged.

After that, it was permanently in my top 3 (in terms of JRPGs, anyway). Then, somehow, I lost all the discs! Obviously I was distraught, since they are super expensive nowadays - and then Last Recode came. It was a no brainer that I bought it the moment it was available.\n\nThe port isn't without its downsides - there's pretty much a permanent tear on the screen, and some scenes and dungeons where there is a noticeable lag, even though my computer is more than capable of running Witcher 3 on Ultra with no problems. (I have a 1070.) \n\nI also have incredibly bad memory, so for most of the second and third game, it was like playing it for the first time, which was awesome! Haseo can be a little annoying at first, but he eventually gets past that. I /do/ think leveling happens a little fast in the game - I very easily hit my level cap for each game before I was even half way in. But there was still always things to do, quests to complete, cards to send to characters, etc. :) \n\nThey change up a few battle mechanics from game to game, so it keeps it a little more interesting and such. Something that does bother me is the way that EVERY character sometimes gets super stupid in battle and runs around on the battle field even though the enemy has 80 health left and I'm asleep but no monster will hit me so I have to wait about a minute before I can actually wake up and kill the thing myself... (I would definitely put the first strategy system from the very first dot hack games into this and future ones.)\n\nOverall, I sunk around 113 hours in and loved almost every minute. The last volume was incredibly short (2 to 3 hours), but it presented a nice little bow on top of everything and revealed to me one or two things about characters that, all these years, I had no clue about. They even have one or two sentences that might possible be hinting towards a future game, if you want to take it that way! (But most of the features are restricted so if you want to continue finding and doing things in the game, it'd probably be better to go back to your finished Vol. 3.) \n\nThe anniversary and this remaster makes way for future dot hack games - I would definitely recommend playing before those (hopefully) come out!", "timestamp_created": 1517699846, "timestamp_updated": 1517699846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39794182": {"recommendationid": "39794182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049141281", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519891969}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm living my childhood all over again.\nJoin me - https://www.twitch.tv/pandaherocommunity\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1296849946", "timestamp_created": 1517589190, "timestamp_updated": 1518289772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.245323", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39764694": {"recommendationid": "39764694", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220612327", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519314512}, "language": "english", "review": "Same solid story telling i remember - def worth a try if you're looking for an rpg to play.", "timestamp_created": 1517478895, "timestamp_updated": 1517478895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39721516": {"recommendationid": "39721516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109916956", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515458114}, "language": "english", "review": "It just generally a good game with good story and gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1517295856, "timestamp_updated": 1517295856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39664970": {"recommendationid": "39664970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034603140", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518147070}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolutely fantastic remaster.

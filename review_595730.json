I paid 8 bucks for the game and it's not a bad price for the product.  The options (A+) include changing between windowed and full screen, adjustment for sound volume, and text speed plus skipping.  The game can be saved an any point (YAY!).  There is a quick save and a quick load function.  Game devs also provide plenty of slots for normal saves, too.

"review": "This is a decent if short \"transported to another world\" / isekai visual novel.\n\nThe characters are all very likable and you're given a fair amount of choice throughout the game. The choices you make do make impact throughout the game which is very nice. For example, you can't just snub off everyone then confess to them expecting them to suddenly fall for you in return. Great change of pace.\n\nThe game is arounnd ~4 hours if you go for all the achievements. I got this when it was discounted for $8 which is a good pricing for a VN with decent branching to this extent. No ground breaking story break offs but still nice.\n\nThe art is pleasing to the eye and though the cg count isn't too high, what's there is nice.\n\nThe only real low points are the climax and the ending. After humorously poking at cliches for a majority of the story, it quickly ends on a big cliche that just doesn't feel satisfying. \n\nOn that point however, the story throughout and character dialogue was extremely enjoyable. Though its impact will mainly be for those that are at least aware of standard RPG tropes.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable read that I found worth and got a smile out of.", "timestamp_created": 1516407033,

(1954),  The Beginning of the End (1957))  ademas  los generos japones del Kaijueiga(Mountruos gigantes Godzilla, Mothra ) y el Tokusatsu (Los kamen Raider , Power Rangers, ultraman ) y por que no que es evidente en impresiones otras rese\u00f1as ciertos aires Heinleniados a la Starship Troopers (tanto novela original  como  la  muy poco fiel pelicula de Verhoeven).  Esta vez desarollado por un estudio occidental  comparandolo con su antecesor no cornologico  EDF:2017 se nos resentan ciertas mejoras como que los personajes no son tan acartonados  pero tambien queda a deber en otros aspectos:\n\nPros:\n-Buen dise\u00f1o de escenarios .\n-Interesante destructibilidad de entornos caracteristico de la serie.\n-Diversion frenetica para pasar buenos ratos  y en cooperativo si es osible seguramente mejor.\n-El modo supervicvencia de oleadas es divertido.\n-Un variedad de diferente stios de unidades de infanteria con sus ropias armas y caracteristicas .\n\nContras:\n-Muy corto poco m\u00e1s de 17  o 15 misiones, no recurdo bien (EFD:2017 predecesor de este tenia 25), la rejugabilidad depende der repetir la campa\u00f1a en diferentes dificultades o para desbloquear el queipo de el resto de las clases de soldado .\n-En frentar a los insectos es divertido enfrentarte a los enemigos aereos sobre todo las naves transortadoras  ueder ser repetitivo , tedioso y agobiante en niveles bajos e incluso con equio avanzado. \nLo corto de la cama\u00f1a afecta enormemente la progreci\u00f3n y la rama de mejoras de armamento  lietralmente tendrias que repetir la cama\u00f1a varias veces para desbloquearle bien el equipo a todas las clase de tropa a usar disponibles . \n-Los vehiculos como tanques , Mechas, torretas en el modo campa\u00f1a se desperdician y se relevan a unas cuantas misiones. \n-Pues el juego tiene un gran potencial en linea y cooperativo sobre todo  en el modo sobrevivencia pero al ser viejo no arece haber muchos con quien jugar. \n-El peor y es el que ha arado de forma subita el continuar jugando el juego, parece que puede presentar problemas con el salvado de datos , a mi se me corrmopio  el salvado de el partida en nube , tenia planeado sacarle unas 6 horas de juego m\u00e1s .\n-pese a la tematica y centrarse en los insectos  mutados por los alienigenas una mayor variedad  de enemigos hubiera estado bien .\n\n [spoiler]  El juego  y la saga en general  se distinguen  por que no es seria, manejar un humor tan pesimo y malo que es bueno a modo de efecto \"Wiseau\" y cosas como el doblaje sobre actuado y malo es inherente y cometamente intencional, no hay EDF sin doblaje  malo y humor pesimo. [/spoiler]  \n\nAun asi  no dejo de recomendarlo, es un juego frenetico, disfrutable  y muy divertido idoneo para llevarse en las ventas y descuentos  , los Dlc que ofrece son muy opcionales y creo que  no aportan mucho al final , pues lleva insecticida a montones , salva nueva Detroit y al mundo, el servicio de fumigaci\u00f3n de plagas de gran escala ha llegado.", "timestamp_created":

particuarly enjoyed, but after playing four hours I can safely say this is some of the most fun I've had in a long time. I initially described this as \"Dynasty Warriors with guns and bugs\", which is hugely reductive, but will give you a sense of what this game is like. The missions are linear, sending you from point to point, either defending an area, destroying spawn points, or fighting a boss, all of which are essentially the same mechanic of 'point and shoot'. Imagine Gears of War without the cover mechanic, plus Dynasty Warriors drops and hordes.\n\nBut to compare this game to typical 'wave-shooters' would be a great disservice. The graphics look great, the voice acting is beleivable and entertaining, the swarms of enemies are extremely dynamic in their movement and serve to never let there be a boring moment. Unfortunatley what this game [i]does[/i] do is give you too much of a good thing. Waves last a long time, and defending a single spot for 5-10 minutes can begin to feel tedious, especially when you've been playing for a few hours. You want to love it, you want more, but the few truely cool moments can often get swarmed from having to mow down hundreds of drones (pun intended). This is compounded by the ludicrously slow growth rate - levelling up from rank 1 to rank 2 took 4-5 missions, the XP requirement for the next nevel was doubled, AND each of the four classes level up indipendently, for which I see some serious grinding required in the future.\n\nAll that said; the visuals are great, the sense of scale and tone are spot-on [i](Starship Troopers, anyone?)[/i], and I am looking forward to playing more!\n\n<Addendum>\nThe problem with this game is the required grinding to make any progress. The game is fun enough on your first play through the campaign, even if the final three levels are a god damn nightmare, but by that time you will have only reached level 2 on most the classes. Getting higher than that will require playing though Normal mode a good 4-6 more times to reach level 5, unless you try the higher difficulty. Higher difficulties are an extreme ramp up, more or less requiring you to reach level 5 first, as enemies that are one-hit-killed in Normal can require 3+ full clips to kill on the next difficulty. The campaign itself feels short and pointless without a real ending, and the gameplay is entirely reliant on grinding if you wish to experience anything but the base content. The worst feature of all of this is that getting a game over after playing a single mission for a solid 30 minutes will reward you with nothing, not even a fraction of the XP you would have gained, and for that reason I'm changing my review to a negative one, as I'm entirely done with this game long before I got to see all of its content.

perfectly honest this game's a bundle of bad game design, frustration and lazyness that very nearly prevented more EDF games to be released to the west.\n\nfor thoses of you hesitating between EDF:IA and EDF 4.1\nDO NOT get Insect armageddon\n\nIts the single worst EDF game out there and you'll get fed up very quickly of the bullsh*t this is gonna put you through\nso let me explain WHY its a bad game\n\nFirst up: Aesthetics \n\nThis game is part of that era of gaming where game devellopers had either all gone colorblind or were in severe depression.\nWhat you'll get here is a bunch generic space marines just barely hiding the fact they're trying to pull the whole \"gears of war\" non-sense of \"little colors, ugly fridges for character\" angle, wich move like they've got something stuck in their *ss and reload their guns by stroking it and reaching for lube in between each stroke leading to very delayed results (more on that later), save for a single class wich instead of stroking his shaking his gun arm like he's trying to shake the gun loose instead of reloading it, but at the very least it won't look as aggravating as the former, speaking of guns, each class has ONE model for each gun type and doesn't change dependant on the gun so if you're hoping for good-looking weapons, I've some bad news for you....\n\nCharacters aren't the only thing that are lackluster as the game seems to pride itself in the fact all buildings (save for thoses outside the map, more on that later) however the devellopers seem to have very quickly grown shy about that and hid the whole thing behind grey blobs of particle effects wich more often than not last far too long for what they do, not to mention most buildings you'll find here are copy-pasted building wich are crammed together as densely as possible to make extra sure you can't see sh*t when they inevitably get destroyed \n\nas far as ennemies go they all more or less look like rubber toys of some kind wich either move in the most generic fashion possible \n\n\nNow onto gameplay:\n\nWhat you're looking at here, is the laziest attempt at a third person shooter I've seen yet, and GOD KNOWS I'm not picky,\nthe main gameplay loop you'll experience is as follows \n\nChoose class, choose guns (or \"buy\" basic ones with a slow accumulating money thats earned through score)\n\ngo into mission \n\nshoot things till dead\n\ngo to next place \n\nshoot again\n\ngo to next place \n\nshoot again\n\nhold \"use\" on something for a couple of seconds (bear in mind if something touches while holding use, the progress on holding use starts over from scratch)\n\ngo to next place \n\nand so on so forth...\n\nNow that wouldn't be bad if the \"shooting things\" part wasn't as boring as watch grass grow, unfortunately you won't have fun chances are, since you have access to a total of 6 types of weapons, three of wich are useful (as in required to use \"useful\") and 3 are pointless as you'll literally never have a opportunity to use them to full potential.\n\nAssuming you use the \"useful\" weapons you'll still have to deal with a design \"faux pas\" that made me hate Gears of war (wich I'll refer to as GoW for short) with a passion, wich is the active reload system, everytime you reload a gun you get a timing mini-game to reload faster, and unlike GoW, nothing else, again if you like this kind of thing it wouldn't be so bad except for a LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THAT IDEA.\n\n\n1: Unlike GoW, you have no point during you're in \"cover\" or safe, the game more or less plays like Serious sam where most of your time spent is spent going one direction and firing in the opposite, so having to deal with that crap on top ain't exactly helping \n\n2: The way weapons work in this game is that each \"weapon\" has its own reload timer (during wich the reload animation just keeps looping non-stop till its finished) and the way it works with the reloading game is that fast reloading weapons are easier to reload and slow reloading are harder to reload, wich is the most backwards crap I ever saw, if slow weapons had a easier reload it would help them keep up with faster reload weapons and give you an actual reason to use that one gun that takes 5 seconds of stroking instead of that other gun wich takes 2 seconds (wich can be further reduced to 1 second easily) almost anytime because you're almost guaranteed to out damage the slower gun\n\nSpeaking of damage, there is no \"strategy\" in this game, its just a raw damage race to whoever deals more damage as your pathetic mobility won't help you dodge 9 times out of 10, in fact the most likely way you'll die is by damaging yourself with your own gun\n\nSpeaking of health and guns, each class has a \"EXP bar\" wich fills using score from the missions you complete, until you \"level up\" your stats will sit there doing nothing, so if you find a mission too difficult, all you can do is find a mission and spam the hell out of it till you actually level up and gain access to guns wich aren't quite as pathetic, and do I have some bad news for you if you hate grinding.\n\nfirst up the AI squad mates the game gives you will siphon away score by killing mobs, making your accumulation of score even slower on top of them being retards that can make your explosive weapons go off in your face point blank, have them try to shoot \"through\" you and subsequently deal you damage, perhaps even stunning you if the bot attempts using a explosive weapon of his own....on top of that the option to disable them must be UNLOCKED by completing a, thankfully, pathetically short campaign of 15 levels (for comparison EDF 4.1 has a minimum of 89)\n\nsecondly the amount of score asked per level up is far too high to make the game enjoyable as if you ARE grinding to make it less of a chore, peoples say that playing dark souls games is \"like bashing your head against a wall until the wall breaks\" and I say NAY, THIS is bashing your head against a wall INDEED, its slow, painful, frustrating and after you're done you get to see YET ANOTHER wall you need to bash and that one's even bigger...\n\nand the \"difficulty\" levels of the game wich are supposedly what gives it more replayability does litterally nothing but multiply all the stats of the mobs by 3, thats it, no new ennemies, no new attacks, no new weapons, no new vehicles (long story short about thoses, they have more health move slower and do less damage than your character and out of 6 vehicles 4 of them are turrets and arguably the mech is a turret with legs)\n\nat the end of the day, the game feels like a unity asset flip: ugly, lazy and boring as sin", "timestamp_created": 1501577039, "timestamp_updated": 1501577039,

Ants, spiders and wasps. Those three in mechanical varient. Hector, Carrier, MK2 Hector, Daddy Long Legs, Final Boss, Queen Ant, Gun ship, Bomber Spider and Ticks. \n\n+ Class system is a nice addition (Trooper, Tactical, Battle and Jet)\n\n+ Active reload although ripped straight from Gears of War is a good mechanic to speed up reloads\n\n+ Levels seem more structured\n\n+ Every thing is destructible\n\n+Good amount of game modes:\nCampaign\nCampaign Remix\nSurvival\nCoop\n\nCons:\n\n- Much less enemys on screen at once\n\n- Achievements will drive you to insanity especially surviving 500 total f*cking waves of survival when you can only survive 2 maybe 3 if your skilled waves each session by your self. You will be done with survival mode and the very words \"survival mode\" will haunt you whenever you see them in other game after playing just 100 waves. 10,000 gun ship kills is also another really fun challenging achievement. Said no one. Even worse some how arrives the horrendously time consuming achievement \"Daddy WarBugs\" earning this one is equivelent to leveling up all armours to max more than twice which is around 100 hours on its own.\n\n- The grind is a never ending slog which the previous con will pretty much sum up. This \"500 waves of survival\" achievement is the very concept of this game \"stretch your paitence and sanity as thin as possible\" you'll be brain dead once you 100% this game. \n\n- Survival mode charactor customization is very small. Two guns in each catagory, forced to play Trooper and no special ability.\n\n- Huge difficulty spike on second to last level. It thinks throwing everything at you at once is difficulty and challenge. You will get through all other levels fairly easy solo. On this one though its a different story... part one pits you against hundreds of mechanical ants and mechanical spiders, beat most of them and you will be pitted against 6 hectors. Beat them and advance to the queen ant and youll be faced with an endless flow of ants, endless flow of mechanical wasps (4 at once), 3 hills (one mechanical spider and the two others mechanical ants and to top it all off, the Queen ant attacking you. Pair this with the inept AI getting stuck on the rocks when trying to come to revive you or simply trying to jump over ledges that are too high making them stuck and forcing you to waste time downing them and reviving. This makes for really frustrating game overs. Game over? Guess what?

Kind of like how we tried to make our own \"Godzilla\" of some kind but called it \"Zilla\" instead, and it apperently sucked. Hard. (Thankfully the original creators bought his Licenseing out, comepletely remade his bio and such, and proceeded to absolutely murder him in the first movie he came in. Or at least that's what I heard.)\n\nThis game, thankfully, is not EXACTLY like Zilla. It wasn't terrible but...it's still a sort of Black Sheep of the franchise for a good reason. It tries it's best to stay close to the formula of the classic games...but it feels as if it's tried to downgrade most, if not all, of the aspects they tried to stick to. \n\nFor instance: This game is friggen SHORT. Only around 15 or so different missions for the campaign plus a few Survival Missions which take place in the exact same maps, which is NOTHING compaired to even the Very First EDF Game on the Playstation. To compare, 4.1 has 89 missions in the Solo Campaign, 9 Bonus Missions in the the Multiplayer to make it 98 there, 23 or so missions in the first DLC Pack for the game, and 20+ in the second pack. That's close to TWO HUNDRED INDIVIDUAL MISSIONS to do!\n\nNext, it's difficulty. This game only has three to choose from...yeah. JUST THREE. Normal, Hard, and Inferno. Compaired to the norm of EDF, which is FIVE, this is yet ANOTHER downgrade because it makes the game way...WAY less accessable. Say you're a New Player to the game, and you start on Normal. If ya find yourself being a bit challenged on there, say it's actually the first Shooter that you as a Player have gotten into and don't know how to properly play, you could go to Easy and ease yourself a bit slower into it, and work your way to the harder difficulties. That is nowhere near the case here.\n\nAnother thing I should mention is how the player grows stronger here. In the other games, only your Equipment grows stronger as you collect bits and pieces to up your Arsenal and Armor. Everything else? Depends on YOUR skill. Depends on YOUR Talent. Your reactions, your planning, your aim, everything. It's mostly on YOU to get you through the fights. It's all on your own Experience.\n\nNot here. This game goes for a pretty damn basic method of getting you stronger for the fights ahead. You can collect some weapons out in the field when you defeat certain enemies, sure...but for the most part? You're grinding Mission after Mission not to collect gear...but to get more Currency and Experience POINTS. These, respectively, allow you to buy your character more gear, and Level You Up increase your HP Ammount and the weapons available to purchase. To me, this system isn't as Immersive, as Creative, or as FUN as the other games.\n\nSpeaking of Fun, my next topic is just that. The fact that this game isn't as Fun as the actual EDF Series. Hell, some people (me included) could find this game...kinda boring really. Besides JUST having 15 missions, they don't really even seem to feel any different at all.\n\nThe Classic EDF Games hold some kind of Magic that keeps every single mission feeling fresh and fun to fight through. It's all fairly Colorful and Vibrant, you can Explore every inch of the map you're given in each mission within it's MASSIVE boundaries, Explosions feel Inherently Satisfying, Bug and Robot corpses litter the battlefield after exploding into Blood or...well just flat out explode to let you see how much you've accomplished...and it all just douses you in Internal Happiness that you simply can't stop,\n\nThis game? Is almost the complete opposite. Everything is put into more \"realistic\" boring brown filters, Explosions feel like you're shooting Weak-Ass Firecrackers at the Enemy (Classic EDF had BETTER Firecrackers as an ACTUAL WEAPON), The maps are far more linear due to stupid plot reasons (i'll get back to this in a second), the Enemy Corpses disappear as soon as they die, and it's all just so slow and sluggish...it's like you're going through a Daily Slog each and every time you come across a horde of enemies. That's terrible, really.\n\nBut it gets worse when I move on to My Last and MOST CERTAINLY Least favored aspect of this game: It's story. Oh god, it's story is just...no. THIS aspect is just flat-out ruined, and is the worst part about the game bar-none. Classic EDF had Rediculous Basic. \"Giant Insects and Massive Machines have come to destroy everything we love and hold dear! Here, take this FORT KNOX LEVEL OF GUNS stuffed in your locker, fellow EDF Soldiers with their own funny Dialogue who will dance and Sing with you on command, and an EXTREME amount of PURE HYPE, and go save our world!\"\n\nThis game? STUPID Basic. \"Our mission is to save the world from the threat of Large Bugs and Accompanying Machines. Here is a truck filled with a large arsenal that you can use. You will have two Squad Mates who will follow and assist you in combat, but you can't interact with them even though they have randomized voice lines that aren't interesting. Follow our waypoints, stick to your objectives, follow this linear path because the Ravagers have created Barriers that we can't cross through-\" Ugh, okay yeah. I can't even continue with that...i've made MYSELF uninterested.\n\nThe worst part is? They actually tried (and failed miserably) to make it a little bit more serious. The Highest Points of it, which really isn't saying much, goes as follows. They build up this mysterious \"Cube\", only for them to say later that it's basically just a really powerful bomb. They activate said Cube to completely destroy a Giant Insect-...oh sorry, they also call THOSE Ravagers here for some stupid reason. They activate it to destroy a RAVAGER Nest, only for their escape chopper to crash and burn, and command says that your team will be \"acceptable losses\". Oh, and the Mothership just appears from out of nowhere at the Final Mission.\n\n{Spoilers Ahead}\n[spoiler]And the Bonus Ending on Inferno...oh GOD the Bonus Ending, just...just don't. It's terrible. It's stupid, it sucked, it was cheesy in a horrible way...it was just terrible. The Normal ending leaves you to question whether or not your team survived an attack from said Mothership after an old friend came in to rescue them via Helicoptor, or died either from the crash or from the explosion of \"The Cube\". So that was at least KIND of interesting. But the Bonus Ending just throws that all away and-...ya know what? No. Fuck it. FUCK IT. I'm NOT even gonna say it! It is not worth your time! Don't even look it up on Youtube! Just...don't![/spoiler]\n\nWith all that being said however...i'm sure there are some people out there who may enjoy this format of game.

The campaign is short, but the four classes and large variety of weapons and equipment to choose from makes missions a joy to revisit. The graphics are dated but perform well. Animations are smooth and the game hardly slows down with tons of crap on the screen. I recently purchased this game through Steam, and boy, online is dead. I haven't tried to play the campaign co-op, but I could not find a single person to play survival. This is a shame because this is clearly a game designed around co-op play. Your AI squad mates in the campaign are competent, but things would go so much more smoothly if I had a human player or two. The survival mode is a wave defense game type that is also highly replayable. The downside here is, unlike the campaign where you have multiple classes, you can only choose one class for survival - the trooper. You can still equip him with the trooper specific unlocks you acquire for him during the campaign, but why the developers chose to limit class selection for this game type is beyond me. It severely detracts from the game's lifespan. Since this game has been out for a while, I'm beyond hoping they will patch it in.

The criticizing never ends when this game is mentioned in the same paragraph with \"EDF\".  However it's not THAT BAD of a game.  Really, it's got a special spot on the shelf next to other EDF games.  I will admit that I DID have more fun with 2017 and 4.1(japan 1st, then PS4, soon *PC) as they had many more levels, more variety, and more replayability in acquiring stuff.  (side note: I was so excited about EDF 4.1 that bought the Japanese version when it released on PS4.  Then the US version when it released for PS4.  As soon as the Steam edition hits a sale I'm buying it too!)  So those are better games and are true to the feel of what people call EDF.  However this game is STILL and EDF title, it is just by a different publisher and that means it has a different feel and taste to it.   Is it awesome?   YES.  Is it full of bugs? :P  YES, and spiders, and giant metal mantis robots too!  (no software bugs that I've found!)  Also unlike 4.1 (as of yet 8/16) it does have genocide guns for each of the armors, which are freaking awesome.    \n\nSo is it worth whatever they are charging for it?  Yes!   On sale?   Grab it!   \n\nTwo things...  go out and search for how to change the fps to 60.  I was one my last achievement grind before I found out about this and it looks much more crisp and PC-like.  Also do yourself a huge favor and spend at least an hour of shooting Kicker (npc) on the first stage.   Just get it out of your system early so you won't waste time doing it later.  Trust me... that jerk brought me and Cyrus (other NPC) to our knees WAAAAAYYYYYY too many times.  \n\nK, awesome game, get it if you like EDF and are bored for some reason.   Also EDF 4.1 >>> EDF:IA.  It just does.   But this is like.... pre EDF 4.1 so... it's alright.

You usually have certain objectives to complete in game although they aren't complicated, mostly a way to get you to move to a different area. There are also plenty of vehicles and turrets to help you. The game looks nice for a 7th gen game, but in my opinion the sound mixing is a little off, so you may want to tinker a bit in the menu. A good 360 port overall though. You might think fighting tons of enemies might get boring, but the action stays engaging. The game is pretty short however, there are 15 levels but different difficulties. Don't just jump into the highest difficulty however. You need to get weapons during the level, which you then buy using in game money you earn from missions. Your character level and weapons carry over which is how you survive on higher difficulties. It's a bit grindy but the gameplay is fun you won't notice. The biggest issue is probably the larger enemies which can get bullet spongey. FIghting huge enemies and carriers can get a bit repetitive, even if you're at a decent level. \n\nOverall a really fun, albeit short shooter. It has it's flaws but at it's price I'd recommend it for some mindless fun.", "timestamp_created": 1469247071, "timestamp_updated": 1469247071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24438901": {"recommendationid": "24438901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027934177", "num_games_owned": 1238, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441495025}, "language": "english", "review": "Disclaimer~ I have played this more on the PS3 version of game\n\nI've heard so many negative things about this game. This is odd, because the reviews are very positive on the Steam page. The negativity seems to be very similar to what Duke Nukem Forever struggled with. Players that remember the previous titles wanted a specific experience the new one didn't deliver on. Like Duke Nukem Forever, this game isn't actually that bad as long you judge it for itself rather than the others. \n\nI have not played the previous title of Earth Defense Force. I can only say that my experience with this title was simply positive. Do I think this is the best thing since gravy? No. I will say this was a better Starship Troopers game than the actual Starship Troopers game. \n\nThe gameplay is okay. It's not too slow, it feels like it's actiony enough for it to be arguably be considered fast paced. While it is fun at first, I will say that the weapons you start with get very dull after awhile. All the enemies you fight, they have a lot of health. This causes you to resent yourself for choosing any of the fully automatic weapons later in the game. The solution is to have slower rate of fire weapons or missile based weapons. \n\nIt gets more tedious, however, when you start unlocking the good weapons that hit the targets for you by heat seeking them. You could literally aim at the sky and the missiles will figure out the rest for you. This basically means that you don't even have to play the game anymore to play the game. \n\nThis is sad, because I feel it could be very gun to combat against enemies with a variety of firepower instead of feeling I have to use specific type of weapons. I cannot help but feel a simple solution would be to just make each weapon have different strengths and weaknesses rather than just saying \"these are the best weapons, you unlock them later.\"\n\nThe player can also pick classes of soldier, which is an interesting touch. There is one with a jetpack, another that's compensating speed for other perks, etc. You can pick based on your playstyle. Downside when playing online? The fastest player gets all the kills and all the tanks sorta just show up late to the party, thus you can argue you're being punished for picking the armor class soldier. Though, not as punishing as being the one guy that picks a cannon based weapon while the other players spam rockets into the sky and hits everything in the area.\n\nThe enemy diversity isn't drastically huge, it's pretty limited. It isn't so small that you will get bored right away, but it does tarnish replay value. That's the same with the actual missions, they're all the same. The game just doesn't feel interesting as far as goals or purpose. You sorta just play to kill.\n\nOnline has some expected choices, such as survival. It's okay, it's not super enjoyable because of the weapons once again as earlier mentioned. The main attraction is just coop for the main game, the \"story\" I guess we'll call it. \n\nOverall, it's a positive experience. It's an okay game, kinda like how some B-Movies are an okay movie. You might not play that movie a whole lot, you'll watch it every time and again. This game? I beaten it on PS3 for single player and never touched it since. I have a hard time wanting to play it on PC. I do think $10 is worth it, but maybe even wait for a sale.\n\n6/10\n\nPros-\nCheap game, good experience\nGameplay is pretty fun and exciting at first. \nSome variety of player customization, such as weapons and character class\nYou fight giant bugs\nYou get what you paid for.\n\nCons-\nReplay value is low\nGameplay is pretty lacking for the long term, it's like a firework. Exciting at first, then you realized you've spent some money on something for very temporary satisfaction that could have gone elsewhere.\nThe game feels lacking and empty as far as content goes, even though I cannot figure out as to why. \nSome weapons are poorly balanced, some are easily spammed and take any skill out of the game, thus all the satisfaction of playing. Ruins the game for other players as well that don't get to kill anything because of their power.\n\n6/10. A positive experience.

It seems like people generally think this was a bad entry into the franchise, but I haven't seen the problems.\n\nThe game is about 20 minutes of new and unique content, interspersed with immense amounts of grind.  You get more powerful weapons with credits and random drops.  You need more powerful weapons and higher levels as missions proceed, because the difficulty curve is wildly inconsistent and enemies become bullet sponges very quickly.  Thus, to proceed you get to the point where you grind early levels for the credits and random drops required to progress.  To my understanding that is the series formula.\n\n\nThe AI is terrible, and often suicidally runs into combat.  The enemies aren't challenging, but they tend to attack in the middle of reloading animations and double the time they take.  The achievements are...frustrating time sinks.  I think the worst part of this game is that you have to grind through it an immense amount of times, because the separate classes all require experience building and the purchase of new weapons to make them viable.\n\n\nAll of this said, the game is good stupid fun.  Grab a couple of friends, spend an afternoon grinding, and completely forget about the game two days later.  It costs less than some movie tickets, doesn't aspire to being something high concept or avant garde, and revels in stupidity (if you beat the last level on the highest difficulty you'll know exactly what I mean. \n\n\n\nAll in all it's a good game.

It takes place around the same time of EDF 2017 and is set in the city of New Detroit. Upon starting the game you can either choose to play the game by yourself or create a new online game for people to join. If you decide to go it alone you will be accompanied by two AI bots named Kid and Cyrus who are not entirely useless but nowhere near as helpful as real players. You can then choose from one of four classes to play as. The Trooper who is your jack of all trades with no real special talents, the Tactical who can lay down turrets and mines, the Battle who is essentially a walking tank with the biggest and most destructive weapons and finally the Jet who can zoom around in a jetpack.\n\nEach class has a different set of weapons exclusive to them and with the addition of being able to change your armor to a few different colors it helps making each class feel unique. So far the game is looking awesome and you eagerly jump into mission 1. The first thing you will likely notice is that this game looks much better than the previous entries and every enemy has been resigned to fit this new, gritty theme it's going for. Personally I actually prefer this art direction compared to the previous entries and it makes it all the more of a shame when you actually start playing it. You see they decided to add RPG mechanics by gathering experience and leveling up your character but the problem lies in that you'll start off completely rubbish.\n\nYour gun barely does any damage, the clip for each weapon is insanely small meaning that you'll be reloading 80% of the time since this is a game about fighting hordes of enemies and probably worst of all is how the Jet class starts off. You know how he has a jetpack? Well yeah, starting off you can very likely jump higher in real life than that thing lifts him off the ground which is just sad to look at and turns him into a glorified roller-skater. 7 hours of playing nearly exclusively as this class and his jetpack is noticeably better after leveling a few times but don't expect to be able to reach most of the surrounding rooftops for a vantage point.\n\nOne of the selling points of the game is that it features 300 guns. Well that too is messed up by this completely unnecessary leveling system since whenever you pick up a gun crate from the battlefield they are inexplicably unable to be used until you reach a certain level. Not only does that take the fun out of collecting loot since it takes so long to level up but it also means you will be forced to stick with your rubbish weaponry due to bad game design. Another thing that is really strange is that every weapon of a category looks exactly the same. As an example the first rocket launcher looks the same as the latest rocket launcher you just picked up, the latest assault rifle does too and every other gun has a single weapon model for its entire category. This makes the feel of finally leveling up and being able to use a new gun all the more disappointing.\n\nUsing explosives in the midst of battle is still as satisfying as ever since every building is completely destructible and by the end of a mission most of the city will be in ruins due to fierce fighting. Unfortunately these new and improved graphics do come at a great cost. There are red \u201cinvisible walls\u201d everywhere and you will quickly notice how small the area you can actually play in are. The game tries to hide this fact by drastically changing how missions are designed. While most of the mission from the previous games set you in a huge environment and tasked you with simply surviving the onslaught, this game is chock filled with way-points you must head to. Go to a certain area and switch a beacon or something equally mundane, fight a horde, then go switch another beacon and rinse and repeat until the game finishes.\n\nThis gets old fast and since there are only 15 missions in this game, each of them last quite some time further making the repetition noticeable. The worst part of it all is that this game switched from the cheesy, plain dumb dialogue of the rest of the series and instead went the dull, serious route. I found the dialogue plain unbearable and most every word you hear out of someone\u2019s mouth will be a random string of words like \u201cBravo Zulu Lightning over\u201d or \u201cAffirmative, Oscar Bravo Lightning Strike\u201d. I guess they were trying to make it sound cool and edgy but it just sounds like a bunch of things kids would say when they take a match of CS:GO far too seriously.\n\nMoving back to the topic of compromises caused by the improved graphics, the amount of enemies that can be on the screen at any one time has been greatly reduced. To give the illusion of facing a horde of enemies they now spawn right around you by crawling out of the ground. This could have been cool if it was used a few times but that is how most of your encounters play out. You go to a way point, receive a string of random words from the mission handler and then enemies predictably pop out of nowhere instantly surrounding you time and time again. Gone are the days when you see hundreds of ants marching to your location as you desperately pick off as many as you can before they reach you. Yes the previous games had graphics right out of the original Xbox but this is a prime case in where graphics are not everything.\n\nAnt hills make a return and still spawn in infinite number of enemies until destroyed. Yes, they messed that up too as you are likely imagining. No longer can you destroy the hill with your rocket launcher that is capable of destroying several skyscrapers with a single blast, now you must walk up right next to the hill and plant a tiny charge on the outside. The worst part of this is that it takes several seconds to set it up and a single hit causes you to start all over again. This was clearly designed to \u201cenhance\u201d coop by forcing your friends to cover you but with how fast most weapons run out of ammo, it's likely they simply won't be able to in many cases. Friendly fire is always on and you will take damage if you mindlessly run in front of a friend that is firing his gun. Your AI companions if playing solo are pretty good at not shooting you but seem to constantly try to get themselves killed when you are firing.\n\nIf you are downed they can revive you and you will be back at full health. Once you finish the campaign you will have the option to turn off the AI bots in future playthroughs. You will also unlock a \u201ccampaign remix\u201d mode that randomizes the enemies encountered. Not really a mode that makes much of a difference to the missions. You also have survival mode where you can play with up to 6 other players and fight until you all drop. In survival you can only play as the Trooper class, gain no experience and none of your guns from campaign can be used. One thing I must praise this game for is that vehicles are now finally helpful and no longer have controls designed by someone that has never played a video game. It is pretty fun to ride in tanks, mechs or just get into anti-air turrets. There are quite a few new awesome looking enemies added as well. At the end of the day I get the feeling that Insect Armageddon wasn't even originally supposed to be an EDF game due to how badly they messed up the basic features this series is known for. It may be fun for a bit if you plan on playing with some friends but I just cannot recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1468029118, "timestamp_updated": 1468029169, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491961", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24124664": {"recommendationid": "24124664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028154227", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467773325}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun game, entirely too short, finished the game wanting more out of it 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1467773665, "timestamp_updated": 1467773665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23952154": {"recommendationid": "23952154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048086402", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467286996}, "language": "english", "review": "Buggy mess", "timestamp_created": 1467286162, "timestamp_updated": 1467286162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23913006": {"recommendationid": "23913006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079334992", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499063718}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is good, but there are thousands of bugs and it gets really annoying.

Unfortunately it lacks immersion, gameplay, graphics, optimisation, sound, weapon quality, enemy AI and general quality, and thats just the top of the iceberg. It's whole foundation compared to the rest of the franchise is just dripping wet with nonsense.\n\nYou may think this then to be a negative review, and typically you would be right, but I still had fun playing it. Still had fun bringing down the bosses, still had fun collecting the weapons and leveling up and still had fun rolling through the game again after completing it. Ultimately I have to recommend this title even with it's flaws as it still anchors onto the EDF franchise and there is a smidge of amusement to squeeze out if you want it.\n\nIn summary, Earth Defence Force: Insect Armageddon is a title that under-shot it's potential to be a good game, and landed firmly in the OK camp.

If you\u2019re familiar with the other games in the series, like 2017 and 2025, be aware this is a different game due to not being developed by Japan.\n\nOverall, the game is nice. While best played with friends, the game does allow for AI teammates that will try their best to revive you when you go down, as well as supplying supporting fire. Dialogue in the game is humorous, in a silly sort of way. Guns are somewhat unique, although on a much smaller scale than other EDF games. (You ever shoot a rocket launcher and find out it splits into a bunch of swirly plasma missiles that crash down and bombard the area?) The feel of each class is enjoyable, and I don\u2019t feel completely useless if my class\u2019s specialty fails (looking at you, 2025). Each class has their own thing they do, and they stand out from each other. Except... maybe Trooper. That's the normal jack-of-all-trades class. No specialty, just \"flexibility\" to choose from any weapon class to use. Bless your soul if you choose to play Trooper.  \n\nCons. Campaign is short. I suppose this is meant to be remedied by the Campaign Remix mode, and three difficulty levels, but I know some people tend to drop games once the campaign is finished. Not to mention that repeating missions can get very boring. As far as I\u2019m aware, absolutely nobody plays Survival mode. Story is weak. It doesn\u2019t even get resolved, even with the alternate ending. It's assumed you're just here to shoot bugs and aliens, and doesn't give you much more. This game is kind of old and not incredibly popular, online multiplayer will probably be a little empty. I can\u2019t say I checked. If you want to keep playing after beating the campaign, maybe you think Inferno difficulty will be a fun challenge, understand you will be in for a real grind. Achievement hunting? Haha. You\u2019re in for a long ride. \n\nIf those things don\u2019t really seem that awful, well, give it a spin.

This shooter places you into a very well scripted b-movie vibe millitary shooter.(Playtime does not reflect my substantial offline time commitment)\n\nObviously you fight giant bugs and robot bugs in the streets of New Detroit with either two generic NPC soliders who don't really get a chance to show you much of thier personality except through the generic chatter they exchange during missions. Or you can replace the NPC's with online players (a much more helpful prospect, the NPCs are tragically underprepared for air combat). While the game advances or the waves of survival continue the types and abilities in enemies introdces new ways the enemy tries to bring the battle to you. The enemy types range from simplistic, to ludicrous health walls, or in the case of most flying enemies extremely challenging targets unless you are carrying the right weapons. \n\nLuckily the game gives you a massive list of weapons to choose from as you play through and unlock more weapons with interesting differences like specific weapon spreads, tracking, DOT and explosion radius. These all may sound like basic shooter fare, but when coupled with the class abilities for each armor (which each have thier own weapon classes used and level up seperately) makes the experience drastically different for each armor. Wether you fly around with the jetpack, taking carefully aimed sniper shots (or rain death with a rocket launcher) from far above the battlefield, or use the tactical armor to drop turrets to add another gun while blasting with your weapon of choice, or play with the largest weapon selection with the solider or use the heavy to deliver maximum firepower to the enemy.\n\nUnfortunately after beating the main campaign, the story remains totally static, difficulty increases simply give enemies more health, even in the Game + mode the only difference is that enemy types are changed so advanced enemies show up earlier than normal. This makes going back into the story (the only way to advance armor level since survival uses a set level core trooper armor) something of a chore, but with a few friends playing for fun it becomes more enjoyable. Survival is a fun distraction, but without any advancement beyond a number of waves it can become stale once you stop trying out new weapons (especially since you can't unlock new weapons or amor levels in survival) and maps.\n\nAll in All: I really like this game on principal, my first playthrough solo was a huge blast, but I regretably didn't get as much out of subsequent returns to the battlefields of New Detroit. Initial Playthrough: 9/10 (only the prolongued sequences of me trying to shoot down aircraft with a shotgun or gernade launcher prevented the ten). Subsequent Playthrough: 6/10 Man.... it just feels grindy once I change to a new armor... and the NPC playstyle only compounds this issue.\n\nFinal score: 8/10\n\nEDIT: Some spelling/grammar correction.", "timestamp_created": 1456609147, "timestamp_updated": 1493087717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21431552": {"recommendationid": "21431552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043690570", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1369419055}, "language": "english", "review": "Totaly amazing)", "timestamp_created": 1456344950, "timestamp_updated": 1456344950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21426648": {"recommendationid": "21426648", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982957189", "num_games_owned": 1722, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500030886}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate Bugs, who doesn't, so lets kill'em all.", "timestamp_created": 1456328007, "timestamp_updated": 1456328007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21397531": {"recommendationid": "21397531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045058810", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478325686}, "language": "english", "review": "When I first saw this game on Steam, I thought it was just another low budget indie game brught in by Steam Greenlight, and I was skeptical at first when buying, ready to refund it when I expected it to be boring or generic. \n\nI don't know what happened, But 16 hours passed.\n\nDon't get it if you want a good story.

Die Grafik ist nicht die beste, die Handlung ist v\u00f6llig sinnfrei und vorhersehbar, aber das sch\u00f6ne ist: Das macht gar nichts! \n\nDas Spiel habe ich urspr\u00fcnglich gekauft, einfach weil es im Angebot war, lustig aussah zum mal anspielen und einen Coop-Modus (f\u00fcr bis zu 3 Spieler) bot. Also ausprobiert und h\u00e4ngen geblieben.\n\nDie Missionen selbst sind sehr linear, eigentlich muss man immer irgendwelche gigantischen Ameisen, Wespen, Zecken und sonstiges Getier mit wunderbar \u00fcbersteuerten Mehrfach-Raketenwerfern, Mechs und Sturmgewehren mit Explosivmunition wegschie\u00dfen. Das macht allerdings sehr viel Spa\u00df, und da macht es auch nichts, die selben Missionen mehrmals zu spielen - sie sind ja eh alle \u00e4hnlich. Die vier verschiedenen Klassen spielen sich sehr unterschiedlich und es lohnt sich, alles uszuprobieren.

It's not difficult to survive, they simply take way too long to die which gets old very fast.\n-Friendly AI is just pathetic and love to run in front of you while you're unleashing a barrage of grenades/missiles which ends up damaging you from the proximity to the blast.\n-when the 'ticks' latch on to you, you need to mash E (or whatever you have it set to) I really wish games wouldn't do this, I have no interest in wearing out my keyboard (another minor point)\n\n\nSummary: it's not the worst game ever, I didn't enjoy my time for the most part so that's why I don't recommend, but I would say to anyone who knows a friend who wants to play it or already has it, for 11$ it's not bad and I would recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1431812060, "timestamp_updated": 1431812060, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15860787": {"recommendationid": "15860787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041666941", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431817707}, "language": "german", "review": "Voll krass!", "timestamp_created": 1431810774, "timestamp_updated": 1431810774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463583", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15792625": {"recommendationid": "15792625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052111924", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431547729}, "language": "english", "review": "You can jihad a flying alien space carrier into the vast armies of giant alien space insects and giant alien space robots..... 9/11 would jihad giant flying alien space carriers again.", "timestamp_created": 1431379881, "timestamp_updated": 1431379881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473251", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15740409": {"recommendationid": "15740409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211486460", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430601981}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game to just play with your friends and shoot at giant bugs.", "timestamp_created": 1431094768, "timestamp_updated": 1431094768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15726419": {"recommendationid": "15726419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043352348", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431283340}, "language": "english", "review": "Its fun in that Serious Sam lots of bad guys way.", "timestamp_created": 1431005667, "timestamp_updated": 1431005667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455904", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15721556": {"recommendationid": "15721556", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987870068", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430519710}, "language": "french", "review": "J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s aggr\u00e9ablement surpris.\nC'est simple, efficace et captivant et je me suis beaucoup amus\u00e9.\n\nJ'aurais aim\u00e9 avoir plus de missions.\n", "timestamp_created": 1430967078, "timestamp_updated": 1430967078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.997501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15498101": {"recommendationid": "15498101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084504738", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508830709}, "language": "english", "review": "I really fear bugs, but this game is great.

First, there is a severe lack of missions. EDF IA has a total of 15 missions. I believe EDF 2017 had around 60 missions of crazy bug shooting, giant robot destroying, campy sci-fi goodness. Yeah, I like that there's a survival mode and a 'remix' of the campaign but I'm sure the devs could've cranked out more than 15 missions. The graphics aren't bad, but EDF was never about having 'amazing' graphics, considering the sheer amount of stuff happening on-screen you hardly have time to notice as you're running from an army of ants and spiders while dodging the blasts of robots that are towering over skyscrapers. The weapons and different soldier types are pretty cool too, and I'm glad to see that the devs decided to bring some variety in that form. I'll recommend this game if it's on sale, but at full price it's kind of hard to suggest, especially when this game has paid DLC, which was a horrible idea for this game. PAID DLC should not have come anywhere NEAR this franchise. In the end, however, this is EDF for the PC and that's quite alright.

In canon EDF there would just be an anthill with bugs streaming out so you end up deciding for yourself to wade in and destroy it so they'll stop coming.

I couldn't imagine that they really did something wrong with the PC version (EDF Insect Armagedon) but they messed it up. The other EDF's are large, you have tons of levels and 4 difficulty to repeat. You find constantly armor to improve health and at least a dozen weapons per level. Not in EDF Insect Armagedon. I played it through within 3 hours (first of 3 difficulties)! You find weapons but only from special monsters (just a view per level if at all) and you have to unlock them with experience points. Additionally all weapons of the same kind (rocket launcher, assault rifle ...) look identically.

Sure, the game looks great, but the designs are highly \"western\". They've removed those chromed Hectors and flying ships (like in 1950s sci-fi movies) for more Americanized grimdark enemies. Very little color in the game at times, ants and spiders practically blend into the Detroit setting (which is the ONLY setting). You play a very short amount of levels in city that looks the same. No green fields with small buildings, no ravines, no beach areas, no different city changes, no underground missionss.\n\nIt plays like EDF, it sort of looks like EDF, but honestly its not worth the current 9.99 price of admission.

The different classes are all distinct in terms of special abilities, but the differences between the different classes' weapons are sometimes so minor that they don't have a distinct feel. Leveling towards the end does feel pretty grindy, with the ramp both of difficulty and experience neccessary to level is incredibly severe after the first hour or so of play. That combined with relativly similar weapons, and having all of the classes level seperatly means that gameplay can become tedious, especially if played alone. This being said, the multiplayer shines. While there are no real changes that i'm aware of between the single and multiplayer modes at all other than AI teamates (that aren't terrible, as I had expected), somehow this game becomes incredibly ridiculously enjoyable when played as a group in the same room.

After my first 15 hours, I got bored and wrote a rather bad review. However, after dusting the game out of forgotten diskspaces for a second time, I actually found it rather enjoyable and when I got my two gaming buddies to get it, it turned into a blast. (Literally)\n\nSo, let's take a look at the game itself, shall we:\nEDF is a franchise that was actually around a bit longer, but usually console-exclusive. EDF:IA is (afaik) the sole PC-avaible title of the franchise.\nThe original franchise relies on 'So bad it's good again'-style of voice acting, cinematics, plot and really doesn't try to take itself too seriously. Combine that with a full-arcade 'omg shoot the aliens' exploding spamfest, and you got a rough draw of what EDF does.\nThis specific instance of the instance is, as mentioned, the only PC title and, sadly, wasn't developed by the original developers, but by a foreign group. And many fans complain that EDF:IA is nowhere near as good as any of the old titles and a bad joke compared to EDF:2025 (one of the more recent titles).\n\nEDF:IA itself is straight forward: Aliens invade Earth, you are an elite soldier group with absurd weapons utilizing endless ammo, and now fight your way through a 15-mission campaign. Doing so, you unlock more and more powerful weapons, till killing the enemies actually becomes a sidequest next to leveling the entire battlefield. Because that is what you can literally do: Level the (exclusive) city-maps to a heap of rubble. And damn, that's satisfying. Especially because your teammate is a jettrooper direly trying to get into a high spot.\nAs with it's ancestors, the main progression point of EDF:IA lies in unlocking new weapons for the four playable classes. Not that every class comes with 5-6 weapon categories, with dozens of (often unique) weapons each, from which you can bring exactly 2 to each mission.\nStandard assault rifles? Sure. SMG's for the Tac Officer? Jep. Rocket Launchers? Duh! BIG rocket launchers? Too.\nTactical Nuclear missile launchers which fires rockets slower then a hulking heavy? Included. Giant multi-missile 8-tuble super-sized nuclear flare ANTI-AIR rockets? Je, this game goes silly at times.\n\nOf course, the game DOES have a fair number of downpoints: First off, it's limited campaign. You get one campaign of 15 missions, which maybe cover ~3-5 hours. Then you get a 'Campaign Remix' which plays on the same maps, but with different objectives and enemy groupings. And lastly a rather crude Survival mode. The game offers 3 difficulty degrees which SEVERELY ramp up said difficulty: On Normal, you have to put effort into actually dieing. On Hard, you will despare in the first mission because those tiny ant enemies suddenly survive your best rocket launchers and actually kill you in a few hits. On Inferno... let's say I didn't yet make it into Inferno.\nCreativity in enemy design is another weak suit of the game: You get Ants. Spiders. Ticks. Wasps. Robots. Then you get Robot Ants, Robot Spiders, Robot Wasps. And another Robot Spider. The game tries to compensate for that by making jokes via the radio. \"Hey intel, what can you give us on this new enemy?\" \"Well, it seems to be... a robot ant! Probably faster, better stronger and more dangerous.\" \"... Thanks, intel...\"\nAnd, one of my biggest complaints, is the stupid AI for your squadmates. When playing solo, your team will be filled up (toggleable though) with AI troopers which are... simplistic. They follow you around, shoot aliens with a rather solid accuracy and do their job quite well on Normal, dieing occasionally. On Hard, however, the AI dies rather regularyly, because it doesn't grasp the concept of dodging attacks, or eventually avoiding those incoming instakill carpet bombers. From what I'Ve heard, it becomes completely useless in Inferno.\n\nWhich clearly states one thing: This is a MULTIPLAYER COOP GAME, to the core. And boy, once I got my buddies into buying this, we had loads of fun blowing up aliens, buildings, each other and some more aliens. And AI teammates, occasionally. But mostly aliens.\nOf course the game has no terribly comlex depth, past organizing a solidly spread out weapon layout, assigning directions/roles to the team (F.e. the heavy battle suit takes care of the frontline, the tac provides carpet bombing support with his launcher and the jet keeps an eye out from above and snipes distant enemies) and learning the bosses' movement patterns to avoid the hard-hitting special attacks.\nBut the sheer amount of enemies and the intense difficulty ramp-up make the game very challenging, nontheless. (Or maybe the fact one of my teammates keeps insisting on using the 9999 damage missile launcher which oneshots most enemies and players alike, and keeps killing either himself or somebody else.)\n\n\nFinal judgement? 7/10\nSolid game, not as good as I would have hoped for, and judging by the countless critique definitely not a high point of it's franchise. But if you get two buddies to play it with, you will very well be busy fragging robot ants for dozens of hours to come. And for a price of mere 10\u20ac, this makes it a really nice budget purchase.\nIf you see it on sale (which I doubt, because this was never on sale, ever), it's a must have!", "timestamp_created": 1402907125, "timestamp_updated": 1402907125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459486", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10432372": {"recommendationid": "10432372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054085702", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1409495041}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is extreamly fun u get bored of play campain do it on higher dificulty and listen to some heavy metal or dubstep or play multiplayer we always need new recrutes!", "timestamp_created": 1402522518, "timestamp_updated": 1402522518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10409887": {"recommendationid": "10409887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032529154", "num_games_owned": 458, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1385862519}, "language": "english", "review": "Who cares about the story. its ment to blow stuff up. when will steam get a port for the new EDF!?", "timestamp_created": 1402341810, "timestamp_updated": 1402341810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.955446", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10403481": {"recommendationid": "10403481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048317208", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429013116}, "language": "english", "review": "This game lets you kill giant bugs with rockets.

It's even hard to convey it in my native language, let alone in English.\n\nOn one hand, Insect Armageddon feels like it wanted to give us something huge. Not just huge insect and robots and insect-robots, but also in terms of contents. Huge maps, destroyable building, neat variety of weapons, limited range of classes that compliments each other. But everything fell short. Not to mention you REALLY need to grind to unlock all the weapons, buy them, and fully upgrade the clasess. Everything just end up repetitive as hell. The \"story mode\" is pretty damn short too. Although that's not really a problem for this type of game since the main point is replayability. But the drive to replaying quickly died down when I'm slogging through same looking maps and same variety of enemies, hunting down mystery weapon boxes hoping 10-20 minutes you're spending would be worthwhile. Even though you could make a meal, go to ATM to pay some bills, clean your laptop or keyboard, write a blog post, shave, shitposting somewhere, stalk your crush, or simply masturbating to your lovely waifu in those time. \n\nIn the end of the day I still enjoyed it, but (while having no expectations in the first place) it's still kinda disappointing. Still, there's not much mindless murder simulator on PC aside from Insect Armageddon and Samurai/Dynasty Warrior. And having alien bugs as enemies does feels pretty refreshing, the only thing that could make this better if there's also bug-space-dinosaur enemies thrown into the mix. Not worth $10 though, but I doubt Bandai Namco would give a f-- I mean, give a price drop for this game. Or for their other \"Westernized\" game from their franchise on Steam.\nI just bought it full price hoping for another PC/Steam release for their games. Preferably the \"too-Japanese\" one.

Shooting games where you fight giant insects is a rarity, so points for a concept that hasn't been explored much. The game aslo has a grand sense of scale, with huge buildings getting destroyed as collateral in the fights and huge boss-type foes that are taller than lots of the buildings themselves. It also usually introduces a new enemy or a new vehicle every mission (at least for a while). Although far from a perfectly implemented, the game also gives the player several classes with their own abilities, and the ability to change your gun loadout between missions. \n\nHowever, this game has a number of problems. First, it is extremely repetitive. There is very little variance in mission objectives. It's always go here, kill all the constantly spawning enemies, repeat. There's little in terms of varied environments; Where you are on the map has almost no effect on how any given situation is approached. Combat is also repetitive, with waves and waves of the same four enemy types with an occasional bullet sponge boss. Waves of enemies tend to go on for entirely too long, and I found myself wishing for a change of scenery halfway through most of the firefights. As mentioned, most of the bosses are bullet sponges, not particularly difficult to defeat, but it takes a very very long time. Only occasionally are boss battles fun.\n\nThe system of armor classes and unlockable weapons is a nice thought, but it is poorly implemented. Weapons can be found on the battlefield, usually after killing some boss monster. However, weapons are also divided into tiers, and even after collected can only be unlocked via leveling up the armor class that uses said weapon. The problem with this is that it can take too long to level up. If you change your armors for the sake of varying the gameplay, level ups are few and far in between, so the weapons you pick up become unused, and the enemies become increasingly durable (the game uses skin swapped versions of some enemies with more health later in the game). Either the game becomes repetitive because it gradually  takes more time to kill enemies or it becomes repetitive by sticking to the same class. \n\nOverall, the game has some good ideas, but most are not very well implemented. Some people might find enjoyment from this game, but the giant bug novelty isn't enough to salvage the gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1396662993, "timestamp_updated": 1434441818, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9706985": {"recommendationid": "9706985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070459786", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1396460678}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0448\u043f\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0432\u043e, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0438\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0435\u0440, \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0432, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c \"\u0412\u044b\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\". \u0412\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043c \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c.", "timestamp_created": 1396464650, "timestamp_updated": 1396464650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534490", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9699006": {"recommendationid": "9699006", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993698981", "num_games_owned": 10501, "num_reviews": 137, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1396583907}, "language": "english", "review": "If you have every played and enjoyed an EDF game before, buy this one.

So many weapons and gun turrets and oh, did I mention they have tanks? No? Well they do... and sometimes, you will need them. BAD. especially when your up against enemies that are a little over 15 stories tall and shoot lazers out their asses while dropping giant jumping spiders who happen to have giant ant friends, that have flying hornet friends... and yest they're also giant... who happen to have flying machines that swarm and suicide bomb you when they're too damaged to fight... who happen to have more friends who are just bigger... and Biggers... and BIGGER...

There is, Tactical (Support), Heavy (Tank/DPS), Jet (Exotic) and Soldier (Jack of trades).\nAll the classes have strengths and weaknesses.

With the way gear unlocks the games stays challenging without being overwhelming.\n\nI would recommend this game as a good laugh.

Insect Armageddon es un t\u00edtulo puramente arcade, un mata-mata en un entorno semiabierto (disponemos de un minimapa de la ciudad, pero nos topamos una y otra vez con barreras rojas invisibles que impiden acceder a una porci\u00f3n mayor de la ciudad) y destructible. Hemos de tener en cuenta que el motor gr\u00e1fico tiene sus muchos a\u00f1os, por lo que la f\u00edsica en la demolici\u00f3n de edicios y estructuras no es un punto demasiado fuerte.\nY aqu\u00ed viene lo importante del asunto. Si esperas un t\u00edtulo tecnol\u00f3gicamente atractivo, con una cierta profundidad en las misiones de la campa\u00f1a y con aspiraciones trascendentales, te has confundido enteramente. Si, en cambio, eres consciente de que los a\u00f1os no pasan gratuitamente, de que ha envejecido ciertamente mal y de que en ning\u00fan momento tuvo aspiraciones mayores de lo que ofrece, en ese caso, posiblemente lo disfrutes las horas que pueda ofrecerte.\n\nCierta variedad de armas y personajes (cada uno con habilidades espec\u00edficas) que se enfrentan a cientos y cientos de hormigas y dem\u00e1s insectos rastreros gigantes con el objetivo de defender una ciudad y su poblaci\u00f3n es una gran idea. La forma de llevarla a cabo, no. Ser\u00eda faltar a la verdad decir que no es m\u00ednimamente divertido. S\u00ed lo es. El problema es que es una diversi\u00f3n ef\u00edmera y muy pasajera. En seguida te empiezas a preguntar el sentido de completar las misiones y lo que es m\u00e1s importante, el sentido de no estar jugando a otra cosa. Y cuando eso ocurre en un videojuego, es que algo falla.\nLos \"final boss\" dinamizan un poco el mon\u00f3tono caminar de abejas y hormigas clonadas una y otra vez, pero en seguida volvemos a la misma sensaci\u00f3n.\n\nEn definitiva, si te gustan los mata-mata cutres sin mayores pretensiones que pasarte horas disparando y defendiendo puntos al azar en un mapa, es tu juego.

On its own, however, I believe it to be a solid game, doing exactly what it sets out to in a more than playable fashion.\n\nEven Serious Sam has a difficult time comparing to the sheer scale of Earth Defense Force's battles, where the smallest of enemies is at least the size of the player and the largest stand as tall as an apartment building. With hordes in excess of hundreds at almost every turn and the player's arsenal constantly increasing in shock value and near-absurdity, things can get a bit more than hectic.\n\nIn terms of variety, EDF is a mixed bag. Much of the combat begins to drag on as the game enters the later stages of the oddly short campaign - doable in roughly seven hours by one's lonesome - as the relatively limited selection of enemies begins to show through.\nIn terms of weapon and playstyle variety, however, I would draw a considerable amount of comparisons to Borderlands. There are an enormous amount of interesting weapons, ranging from run-of-the-mill assault rifles to airburst missiles that rain smaller warheads down on their targets after detonation. Four different classes, such as the unmatchably maneuverable Jet and the nigh-unkillable Battle, give good options for players of all persuasions.\n\nGraphically, the game is another toss-up. The streets of the cities feel somewhat empty and undetailed and, while undoubtedly pretty to watch and true game-changers for the battlefield environment, the collapse of buildings leaves much to be desired in their wake. Skyscrapers end up leaving little but a neatly-confined pile of rubble, cars explode piecelessly, and the thousands of enemies slaughtered in the campaign leave little but a brief, fading corpse - which, humorously, is often sent hurtling into space by some of the higher tier weapons.\nHowever, much of the model work is definitely up to par, and while the lack of graphical options and locked framerate makes the game feel much like a console port, the game runs flawlessly.\n\nThird party support, unfortunately, seems to be nonexistent. There's not much else to be said here; unless I've simply failed to find it, there's no possibility of a modding community for any but the most die-hard fans.\n\nIn the end, at its cheap price point of $10 USD, it'd be hard to turn this game down. If you're looking for something with longevity, that price point may be less exciting. Even still, for someone looking for a quick, frantic, larger-than-life game that charmingly follows every clich\u00e9 in alien invasion movies, this is most definitely the game to be sought.", "timestamp_created": 1360857212, "timestamp_updated": 1360857212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493203", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "4769998": {"recommendationid": "4769998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041653226", "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428263506}, "language": "english", "review": "It's not as fun as the other titles in the series, but it's still a blast to play.

Despite the technical issues which I will go into further in detail, the game is surprisingly fun, albeit a little frustrating at times. First and foremost, the controls are a little jenky. Plain and simple. They do not always respond the way you want to, however, they are not terrible. The teammate A.I. is horrible. In a game where you are getting swamped left and right literally hundreds, if not more, enemies at once, your teammates ability to hold their own is very important... and the A.I. completely drops the ball. They are inaccurate, will just stand there soaking up damage and dying a quick death and also, for some reason, seem to have an inability to revive you if you fall in battle. This is especially problematic in major boss battles where you are getting swamped with 2 or more boss enemies and the usual barrage of hundreds of normal enemies and when there are few wide spread checkpoints in the level.\n\nAll this being said however, the game is unusually fun and entertaining despite these issues. There is something gratifying each time you make an enemy go splat and a great sense of accomplishment when you do actually complete a level. The charterer leveling system is fulfilling as well. Each tier unlocks new weapons, deployables and upgrades, which in turn makes playing single player more enjoyable and less frustrating. The game really shines in co-op mode however and makes most of the technical issues much more bearable. The story is really not anything that special. It is pretty much just an excuse to blow away tons of abnormally large insects, arachnids and aliens... which is just fine as long as you know what you are getting into.\n\nFinal verdict: Despite the technical flaws the game is a fun kill fest that is worth the minimal money it costs.  4/5 stars", "timestamp_created": 1352795786, "timestamp_updated": 1385410493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475814", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "1234847": {"recommendationid": "1234847", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989784506", "num_games_owned": 1043, "num_reviews": 355, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1352707200}, "language": "english", "review": "Its fun to kill some ants.

Do you like choosing between dozens of different types of guns, anywhere from launchers, rockets, sniper rifles, shotguns, assault rifles, and so many weird types of weapons that there's something for everyone. I change up my weapons frequently. The environments are destructible as well, so most of those weaopns will decimate all the buildings as well.

Start normal, level up and get better weaopns and more health, then move to the next difficulty. I recmmend getting 1 level below the level cap per each difficulty.

I found this game in my library, probably because I paid for Ubermosh: vol. 3 recenty, but I of course I wouldn't hesitate to pay for any title from Ubermosh series. The balance came as close to the limit in term of \"dealing max damage without spoiling the fun\" as poossible, although I must admit that the game feels a bit less \"hard-core\" than the earlier chapters do. More, instead of \"Ubermosh: Wraith\" it may be as well called \"Ubermosh: Revenge of Kensai\" because of balance issues that occur for characters with \"Better manastrike / 40 kills for brainclap\" traits: manastrike leads to brainclap almost instantly. The most-specific classes (Wraith, Psyker, Kensai) are the easiest ones to play (and to get max kills per 90 secods), and Warlock is maybe the most difficult one, because it has only 2 lives, while it is possible to acquire \"better equipment\" in 15 seconds of play while still retaining 4 \"cores\" in Basic class. Addition of tough guys that require several hits is nice idea too, but is it only me who thinks that you should instantly slay them with a sword? Otherwise approaching them closer is not so rewarding.  Anyway, I would recommend this game both for newcomers and the fans, and newcomers should definitely buy this along with \"Ubermosh: Black\" to perfect their skills.

It's so fun to play and the feel you get when you are in the middle of 50 enemies as kensai and come out unharmed is soooo good. It's new mechanics have definently bettered from the other games.\n\nPros: Good mechanics, small but diverse amount of guns, delfecting is reaction and intuition based as opposed to timing based, enemies can get the better of you if you dont position well, hard mode is HARD, great thematic graphics, low price, different classes bring challenge and variety, mana burst is very strong but well balanced, brain burst is so fun to chain and unleash with mana burst, very good soundtrack that gets you into the game more.\n\nCons: Enemies sometimes shoot weird, sometimes waiting long periods of time before shooting at you(could be just to make relfecting harder), game could prove to be too hard for casual gamers, could be more class variety, don't see a need to set mana burst to anything but circular.\n\nHope this helped you to a decision but I really hope you get this game I promise you will not be dissapointed.", "timestamp_created": 1489758593, "timestamp_updated": 1489758593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30484944": {"recommendationid": "30484944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038423496", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510266939}, "language": "english", "review": "It's always nice to see a new volume of Ubermosh released, because though each game is a tweaked version of the next, the tweaks and fine handling are what really make the game.\n1. Adjustable manastrike is a nice addition, feels a bit more dynamic to use than the brainclap of earlier versions.\n2. Shielded enemies make for a slightly increased challenge, but you pretty much just ought to run away.\n3. 2nd best gun spawn time earlier? Feels like you get it faster than previously.\n4. Good soundtrack additions, feels pretty badass when loading in for a PR run.\n5. The lack of terrain is a good design choice over earlier Ubermosh volumes, but would like to see an occasional obstacle (in the last 10 seconds it's possible to ignore the screen as you pray for enough kills if you have the best gun and a good spray pattern.)\n\nMost I would recommend for a new volume is a new gun or two, with slightly more varied mechanics than \"more bullets and more spray.\"", "timestamp_created": 1489379961, "timestamp_updated": 1489387619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503106", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30479909": {"recommendationid": "30479909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166306285", "num_games_owned": 599, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513823320}, "language": "turkish", "review": "kanser oldum amk oyna oyna y\u00fcksek score yap\u0131cam diye diye sabahlar olmu\u015f.", "timestamp_created": 1489353822, "timestamp_updated": 1489353822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30416586": {"recommendationid": "30416586", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998597225", "num_games_owned": 1544, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489071559}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440 UBERMOSH, UBERMOSH:BLACK \u0438 UBERMOSH Vol.3.\n\n\u0414\u043b\u044f \u0442\u0435\u0445, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u043c\u0435, \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0430\u044f \u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430 -

It's a hard game at first, but once you get the rhythm down, you'll be mowing down enemies with ease. \nThe only real criticism I have, is that the enemy bullets, and the smaller enemies themselves, can be difficult to see near the end of the game, as each kill leaves a bright blood pool on the ground, which can cover half the screen as the player gets snowball effect going with the kills. Possibly this is intentional? As the player tends to move away from the blood in order to see. \nFor 2\u20ac the game is an absolute steal.

problems when first trying out the game but thankfully it's all been fixed now. That's a sign of a great game developer right there, one who helps fix the problems of the games as well as making new games. Have I already mentioned that I admire and respect Walter Machado as a game developer?\n\nBut now that I've had chance to play properly, I can safely say that WRAITH is even better than before. You've still got the classic UBERMOSH gameplay of 90 seconds in the arena to gun down as many enemies as possible, but now you've got the 'Manastrike', a move that sets off at random intervals to wipe out even more enemies, as well as a return of the brainclap and the open arena.\n\nAll I can say is that this takes all the best parts of the series and brings it all together in one juicy package and adds new extras and new achievements. And new music! As well as the familiar soundtrack, we've got some new songs to mosh to! Just makes gunning those enemies down even more fun.\n\nThe only downside is that there can be some occasional slowdown when there's a lot going on (though that may be because my computer isn't all that powerful) but this doesn't detract from the experience. This is still stupidly good fun.\n\nIf this is the last installment of the UBERMOSH series, then I certainly look forward to more of Walter Machado's future projects (and if you haven't already, check out Trip to Vinelands).\n\nAll in all, this had everything I could expect in an UBERMOSH game, and more.

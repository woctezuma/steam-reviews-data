I picked it out to play through a randomizer because of the sheer volume of games I own. Despite that, no matter what reasons it fell into my hands to play, I\u2019m glad it did. This is a game that length wise is short and refreshing while offering up some difficult puzzles. All of which is tied to a story that while vague is beautiful.\n\n[h1] Puzzles [/h1]\nThe puzzles are something I still don\u2019t really know how to feel about. I\u2019ve mulled over it for a while and I thinks while there\u2019s a few negatives, the positives outweigh them. It\u2019s a colour based puzzle, separated into acts with each act introducing a new mechanic. At first this seems like a good idea, the more mechanics they add, the more it seems to simplify the puzzle. Once you figure out the one hard little knot, the puzzle falls into place for you and you\u2019re left feeling a little unsatisfied. Compared to other puzzles games, you don\u2019t get a sense of accomplishment from completing the puzzles. The last puzzle I think is very charming and really finishes the game off well. \n\n[h1] Art [/h1]\nThis game\u2019s art is charming. It\u2019s reminiscent of a children\u2019s book which is only aided by the story. Each act brings a new environment that matches the pacing and the puzzles quite well. As you journey up through the puzzles you start to understand how each location reflects within the story itself. I feel that the game may have been better off as a phone game but having the art in full resolution and colour works far too fantastically. It\u2019s whimsical yet doesn\u2019t undercut the sad and emotional tone of the game. \n\n[h1] Soundtrack [/h1]\nI could honestly say that this music was one of the main reasons I cried. The story had already bore a hole in my heart and the music just further opened it up. It was well composed with nothing that would make it harder to think yet still conveyed a certain feeling. They\u2019re shooting themselves in the foot by not making a soundtrack so great purchasable. Each song is perfectly tailored to the environment especially the act. The final act is what I would say a perfect culmination of a game. Everything peaks, the art, the sound, the music and the puzzle at the end is fun and charming.\n\n[H1] What Makes it Special? 78/100 [/h1]\nThis is where I want to address the story throughout the game. It was lovely and it did in fact make me shed tears. I fell the only thing that might of made the writing slightly better is if it was voiced as to address some of the confusion over who is talking and to also add another layer of emotions. I do think that everything about this game ties around the story like a neat little package. Overall this game gives a nice but succinct finish. All the ideas are addressed and it doesn\u2019t really give a feeling of longing at the end. You can tell it was made with love and that they knew it had to finish when it did.\n", "timestamp_created": 1514268099, "timestamp_updated": 1514268099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38666343": {"recommendationid": "38666343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157038404", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506735263}, "language": "english", "review": "Charming puzzle game, with rules that get more complex as you go through it.", "timestamp_created": 1514223732, "timestamp_updated": 1514223732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38360286": {"recommendationid": "38360286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032512213", "num_games_owned": 686, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513457617}, "language": "german", "review": "Great puzzle design!

Progressing through 8 Acts, with each introducing a new mechanic, your task is to guide all the mushroom-headed people onto a pedestal. Quite the difficult task with what you're expected to work around in later levels.\n\nThe story is quite outlandish to begin with, but is revealed to you in text before each level commences. It tells a story of love, loss, death and acceptance. It's a exquisite way of telling a tale and how it fits in with the gameplay makes for quite the discovery! It's odd to find a puzzle game with a narrative but She Remembered Caterpillars handles it spectacularly.\n\nDefinitely a game to consider if you're a fan of puzzles, but those more casually-minded gamers might struggle with the concept.

I'm not a huge fan of puzzle games, but I really enjoyed this one.  I was pulled in by the stellar animation and not disappointed.  As the stages progressed in difficulty it got to a point in the early 30's where I was having much less fun,  but even then I appreciated the challenge and soldiered on through the last few levels to 40.  \n\nHats off to the game designers, they made a lot of wonderful choices when making this game.  I love the simplicity of controls.  The only UI in each stage is a simple menu button to let you focus on the puzzle.  It's simple, small, well placed, and blends into the background while still being easy to find if you want it.  While I'm not colorblind, I do think the game's design benefited from pairing colors and shapes together.\n\nNew mechanics are subtly introduced throughout the game without needing a tutorial or a constant reminder to push X button (The Last Guardian I'm looking at you).  The only time they really break this teaching by exploration is when you can merge and split gammies.  I completely agree with their decision as I don't think most people would have been able to figure that out.  I hate starting a new game and being forced to play a tutorial and memorizing an overcomplicated control scheme.  I also hate games that won't unlock their core mechanices until an hour or more into the game.  She Remembered Catapillars does a fantastic job at giving you the core mechanics right away, without handholding, and then subtily building on them throughout the game.  I wish more games took their approach and executed it well.  Again,  great game design.\n\nThe story is brief and encourages lots of interpretation.  In essance it's about a daughter dealing with the death of her estranged father.  Honestly, lots of it doesn't make much sense to me.  It's kept short enough to not detract from the game though.  The story is quite puzzling, and I'm not interested in trying to unravel its meaning.  It seems fitting a puzzle game would have a puzzling story.  I bet others will have some interesting theories on what it all means, since it seems like the game has plenty of figurative allusions and symbolisms.  It would be nice to have a menu option unlock after beating things so you can see just the story on its own.  Maybe then I could make more sense of it.  Somehow it feels like the puzzles are taking place in your father's brain, but maybe I'm just reading into things too much.\n\nI feel the art direction of the backgrounds helped convey what the girl in the story was going through in a very abstract way.  [slight spoilers in the paragraph] In act 1 things start small while the story speaks of childhood.  Other sections seem diseased and decaying.  It then has a mechanical, almost surgical influance.  The hands in act 5 could symbolize trying to hold on to life, or having it slip away.  Act 7 feels empty and full of loss.  Life has gone.  Act 8 has the most gorgeous, abundant background of them all, showing rebirth, renewal, and perhaps acceptance of loss with the recovery that takes place afterwards.  \n\nAll in all it's a very well made game that strays from the tired zombie/crafting/FPS games flooding the market.

while overcoming obstacles that include things like blockades for certain colours, bridge switch mechanics, etc. \n\nStory-wise the game is subtle and only gives excerpts of expositions as an intro to each level. It tells a decent story that has some good moments but it's easy to kinda overlook it when you're trying to go through puzzle after puzzle or if you're still recovering from the previous one.\n\nThe game is really difficult, it's not one of those puzzle games where the solution is immediately apparent and instead requires alot of experimentation. A new colour or mechanic is introduced every chapter (comes around every 4-6 levels) and the mixing of these mechanics makes it more complex in a way that's different from other games like portal. Because you're able to see the entire puzzle map from the start, segmenting the entire puzzle into parts to complete in an order is much harder than traditional puzzle games like Portal. You could very much end up getting one bug to one destination before realizing that you probably need him to get another bug somewhere else. The puzzles are all very logical and probably only have one solution per level and as a result, the game gives you a good challenge. \n\nMix all that into presentation that's really unique (if you've heard of fungipunk aesthetic before playing this game, I'd love to find out where) and BGM that's subtle but fits nicely into the aesthetic of the vastly different visual maps, and it's good game for this niche genre. The parts we come to expect from this genre are done well and the parts we didn't are fascinating enough to give a fresh look into the game.\n\nHere's a more detailed video review if you need more information: https://youtu.be/RBWstOU2lJs", "timestamp_created": 1486340513, "timestamp_updated": 1486340513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.391281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29729505": {"recommendationid": "29729505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025788446", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487024097}, "language": "english", "review": "She Remembered Caterpillars has a simple premise: Bring the little hooded guys to the white mushroom platforms.

As the plot thickens and becomes more complex, so do the puzzles, and you'll want to see the story through to the end--no matter how much you need to wrack your brains in order to complete the puzzle at hand. [/h1]\n\nThis is one of those games that you have to take a moment to digest after you've completed it. I'm not entirely sure what happened in the 40 chapters that transpired, though I'm sure there are some passionate forum posts somewhere arguing symbolism and the like, but what I am sure is that it was a sweet story that featured the simple love of a parent and child.\n\nThe game is divided into Acts and each Act has a number of chapters--40 in all. At the beginning of each chapter you're given a snippet of story and then you are tasked with leading some fungi creatures called \"Gammies\" to their proper place on a white flower that acts as a helipad for them to use to take off at the end of the stage.\n\nIn order to do that, you'll have to guide different coloured Gammies across/through obstacle. There are a few types with their own rules. None of the obstacles were actually named, so bear with my labelling. \n\nBeetle Bridges:  only Gammies of the same colour can pass.\n\nFerns: Gammies of the same colour cannot pass, but all others can. This applies to Gammies created by mixing colours; a purple Gammie, for instance, cannot pass through blue ferns.\n\nShell Bridges: these look luke sea shells. Any colour Gammie can cross these, but they require a switch (or switches) to be pressed so that the two halves of the bridge meet.\n\nColourizers: coloured devices that remove the their corresponding colour from Gammies. It can also add colour to a stripped white Gammie. White Gammies can pass through any fern, but cannot cross Beetle Bridges.\n\nSwitch Bridges: these look like remote controls. Any Gammie of any colour can pass them, but a fused of Gammie cannot. You can only pass in a single direction once; i.e. if you cross from the left, you need to have a Gammie cross from the right before the bridge resets and allows another Gammie to cross from the left. These are introduced later in the game and add a new logical element to puzzle solving: you need to pass them a certain number of times in order to create a clear path for other Gammies to cross.\n\nBlack Gammie: you\u2019ll only see one of these at the very end of the game. They can pass over any bridge, but cannot go through ferns.\n\nThe game is lovingly hand-drawn and the animations are adorable. It\u2019s a joy to watch the Gammies stand at attention, run to an indicated area, and crouch down to appear as innocuous fungi when your attention shifts to one of its brethren. It has a very family-friendly vibe with its bright colours and cutesy sound effects. Meanwhile, the music is adequately atmospheric; energetic and bubbly in the appropriate places and somber and slow in others.\n\n.Pros.\n[list] [*] The game looks great. It has a very distinctive art style.\n[*] The music is peaceful and thematic.\n[*] There is an interesting, if puzzling, story wound between puzzle solving segments.\n[*] Puzzles get progressively more difficult and complex. Different elements are added at bit by bit and they all work together like a well-oiled machine.\n[*] The puzzle mechanics themselves. There are quite a few of them and the variety keeps things fresh. [/list]\n.Cons.\n[list] [*] No replay value. Once you\u2019ve played through all of the puzzles, I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019d want to play again.\n[*] The difficulty towards the end of the game ramps up fairly quickly. I got stuck on a puzzle for nearly an hour before looking up a guide.\n[*] No explanation of elements beyond the very beginning of the game. This isn\u2019t a huge issue, but it would have been nice to know that I needed to change my way of thinking once the switch bridges had been added. \n[/list]\n\n.Bottom Line.\nThis is a challenging puzzle game that\u2019s definitely worth a playthrough if you\u2019re interested in the genre. I recommend the game to story lovers, puzzle solvers, and those seeking an experience from a game that transcends the typical \u2018get from point A to point B\u2019 gig.\n\nShe Remembered Caterpillars may not be my favourite puzzle game, but it\u2019s definitely in my top ten.\n\n[code]If this review helped you, please give it a thumbs-up.

With a gorgeous and colorful handrawn style that looks like something out of a bestselling picturebook, and a powerful sound design that evokes the mysticism of a forest untouched by human exploration. from the whimsical and almost fantasy-like usage of organics to the usage of the small and cute spores who act as spirits of nature itself, [i]She Remembered Caterpillars[/i] gives a playful yet raw atmosphere of the more mysterious side of the natural world. Each screen is an entire work of art, and each work of art is the stage in which you navigate your small and color coded spore species.\n\nBridges can only be crossed by Gammies of the same color, and gates can only be passed by Gammies of the opposite color. And where things really get complicated is where you can combine Gammie's colors to make a new color that can pass through bridges any of its base colors but is still sectioned off by gates of another color. It's actually very hard to put into words and as I attempt to try I realize that this is a game that has to be \"felt\" to really get the full picture with, as you learn with every mistake how to utilize the combination of colors to properly navigate the vibrant fungal forest and sanctuary of spores.\n\nThough the two games are wildly different in execution, I couldn't help but think of Pikmin while playing [i]She Remembered Caterpillars[/i]. Perhaps it was the adorable and iconic 'Gammie' creatures that play a part as guardian spirits of this fungal world, or the focus of color co-ordinated logical thinking, or the fact that it all takes place in a living and breathing natural world that acts and reacts as a part of the game itself. Whatever it was, I felt a special sense of nostalgic mysteriousness from a time where gaming seemed more unpredictable, fresh and new to my young mind.\n\nSome games are made to be experiences that leave a lasting impression, and some games are made with the intention of purely being fun to play.

To get a good impression of the game, watch my gameplay review of Act 1 & 2 at the top.\n\nI thought this game was going to be about 5 USD, I was very surprised that it's 12. That's around an hour of work for me or about 3-4 gallons of milk, or half a tank of gas even with Fuel Perks on.[strike][spoiler]or the yearly income of a channel our size.[/spoiler][/strike]\n\n[i]To be fair, you can't discount all the talent and hard work that went into this absolute aesthetic masterpiece, I know personally that this game has taken them a year to make. I would definitely be willing to give 12 dollars for this if it was just me; but Steam caters to millions of people across the world, the average game sells 32,000 copies, I wouldn't say that this game's gonna make as much, seeing as how it's a puzzle game and might not appeal to the biggest news outlets or Youtubers, who drive sales of some games through the roof. So let's say this game sells only 10.000 copies, that would mean these two devs have to divide 120,000 in revenue, right now they're not even selling it for 12 dollars but 9.59 so that'd make it 95,900. This is without any percentages that Steam might take and other expenses. Steam takes about 30% at least, which is 28,770.\n\n95,900 - 28,770 = 67,130. Each person takes 33,565. A person working full time for a year in my state makes $16,848.00 per year, two years is 33,696. That's nice and close, I like that number, it even has a 69 teehee.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that at it's 9.59 price rate, selling 10.000 copies if it's in a year, would only be minimum wage, enough to drag these devs into having to make another game by next year or run out of money.\n\nWe all know minimum wage isn't very nice especially for a college graduate that's following their passion and laboring away for a year.[/i]\n\nSo now I'm done with this review I think that my first impression that it was going to be $5 was very low, there is a lot to this game, a story that drags you in, puzzles that hurt your brain [spoiler](get this game and by Act 4 you'll feel like ripping your hair out if that's what floats your boat)[/spoiler], amazing art, cute flying spore thingies, professional gameplay and interfaces. Get this game at full price if you know the struggle or you want to support an indie dev today and put a smile on their face.\n\n[b]12 dollars is what you pay to see a movie that's a little more than an hour long, this game will bring you hours of an experience that may stay with you forever. Go buy it.\n\n~ Approved.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1484704291, "timestamp_updated": 1484743101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.412789", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29326857": {"recommendationid": "29326857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165947033", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508647547}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful game!", "timestamp_created": 1484697329, "timestamp_updated": 1484697329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.396386", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29326419": {"recommendationid": "29326419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198270138981", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489713020}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a puzzle game based on navigating little fungus people (gammies) to launch pads, so they can fly away. Getting there involves crossing caterpillar bridges and other obstacles. The gammies are marked by a colour and a shape, which dictates which obstacles they can cross. Using colours and shapes gives a backup for anyone who can't use one or the other, which is helpful for colourblindness or not being able to see fine detail very well.\n\nProgress through the game is split into acts, which slowly take the player higher up a structure. Each act has a distinctive art theme, which reflects the feel of the story at that point. I loved the style of the art. It's hand drawn and whimsical, in a twisted fungal kind of way.\n\nThe story is told through text, which appears at the start of the levels and acts. It floats between memories of the girl and her father, and trying to save him using the gammies. It's a non-linear approach to storytelling that I see more often in short stories than games, and it fits very well here.\n\nI enjoyed the game and would recommend it. The shape and colour concept of the puzzles was interesting, and it was very relaxed as there was no time limit. The art and story were great. Everything combined together to create something unique.

Ziel des Spiels ist es euren demenzkranken Vater vor dem Tod zu bewahren. Die verschiedenen Farben eurer Spielfiguren - rot, blau und lila - m\u00fcsst ihr gekonnt einsetzen um die 40 Levels l\u00f6sen zu k\u00f6nnen. Ziel eines jeden Levels ist es alle wei\u00dfen Blumen mit den entsprechenden Spielfiguren zu besetzen. Rote und blaue Spielfiguren sind standardm\u00e4\u00dfig vorhanden, die lilafarbene Figur k\u00f6nnt ihr erstellen in dem ihr mit einem Rechtsklick auf der Maus rot und blau mischt. Aus zwei mach eins in diesem Fall. Ihr k\u00f6nnt die lilafarbene Figur durch einen weiteren Rechtsklick aber wieder \"teilen\" und dann wieder mit den beiden roten und blauen Figuren spielen. Br\u00fccken bestehen entweder aus blauen oder roten Tausendf\u00fc\u00dflern bzw. Raupen. Mit der blauen Spielfigur k\u00f6nnt ihr z.B. nicht \u00fcber rote Br\u00fccken gehen und anders herum. So muss man wirklich gut \u00fcberlegen wie man ans Ziel kommt. Oft ist dies auch nur \u00fcber die bereits angesprochene Verschmelzung beider Spielfiguren m\u00f6glich. Au\u00dferdem sind manche Bereiche auch durch farbige Tore abgesperrt, welche auch nur mit manchen Figuren zu durchqueren sind.\n\nErw\u00e4hnenswert ist auch die absolut hochaufl\u00f6sende Grafik von Daniel Leander Goffin, der auch Symmetrain erfunden hat, welches ihr vielleicht vom iPhone kennt. Diese geh\u00f6rt zu dem Besten was ich indiem\u00e4\u00dfig in der letzten Zeit gesehen habe. Nicht umsonst hat das Spiel eine IGF Nominierung f\u00fcr \"Excellence in Visual Art\" erhalten. Ein kleines bisschen erinnert die Grafik an ein wundersch\u00f6nes handgezeichnetes Kinderbuch. Die stimmungsvolle Musik kommt auch von einem nicht ganz Unbekannten: Thomas H\u00f6hl, der unter anderem die Soundtracks f\u00fcr die bekannten Deponia-Spiele komponiert hat. Das ganze Spiel wirkt absolut professionell programmiert. Die Steuerung, welche komplett per Maus erfolgt, ist absolut pr\u00e4zise.

[/h1] \n\nAl entrar al fantasmag\u00f3rico mundo de She Remembered Caterpillars lo primero que notaremos es su particular y abstracto modo de contar una historia, la misma solo se desarrolla en breves fragmentos textuales, similar a lo que supuso Unravel en su momento. Sin embargo, en su interior se aguardan temas m\u00e1s profundos, dejando de lado su cautivadora historia. \nShe Remembered Caterpillars fundamente su jugabilidad en los puzles, utiliza la l\u00f3gica y el ingenio para avanzar en su org\u00e1nico mundo de fantas\u00eda, y para ello elabora unas mec\u00e1nicas frescas, puras y completamente originales que se miden principalmente por el uso de colores. Entrando un poco m\u00e1s en detalle, la aventura nos da el control de una serie de micro personajes, estos seres toman la forma de diferentes colores como el azul, amarillo, y rojo, bajo el paso de estos curiosos seres debemos sortear diferentes caminos para llegar al punto de inter\u00e9s, y de ese modo viajar al siguiente cap\u00edtulo. Sin embargo, los puzles van escalando su dificultad, y la transici\u00f3n eventualmente se torna m\u00e1s complicada conforme avanzamos en la aventura. \n\nAl principio solamente tenemos un par de colores, y por razones obvias, los caminos solamente se activan en base a ellos, como por ejemplo el rojo para puentes rojos, sin embargo, en cada nuevo nivel las mec\u00e1nicas van variando, y adem\u00e1s se a\u00f1aden nuevos personajes que pueden ser combinados e implementandos con el escenario. De este modo, se puede utilizar el rojo y azul para crear el morado, y sortear caminos de sus colores iniciales (rojos y azules) o por otro lado, usar el rojo y amarillo, y as\u00ed crear el naranja. Aunque, como mencione m\u00e1s arriba, cada color tiene sus restricciones y limitaciones, combinarlos no implica avanzar eternamente sobre cada puente o puerta, sino que debemos observar detenidamente el escenario, sus caminos y las opciones que se adecuan m\u00e1s a cada color, de este modo ser\u00e1 m\u00e1s sencillo avanzar en su mundo. \n\nDe todas formas, She Remembered Caterpillars pone al l\u00edmite la l\u00f3gica y el modo de percibir las cosas, cada nuevo nivel se destaca principalmente por ofrecer nuevas mec\u00e1nicas y elementos como mol\u00e9culas org\u00e1nicas que quitan o adhieren colores, o puentes que solamente tienen un sentido preestablecido. Estas tan solo son algunas de las tantas alocadas y llamativas ideas que encontraremos en She Remembered Caterpillars, pero lo genial de todo esto es la originalidad de la que desborda, la implementaci\u00f3n de los colores, las m\u00faltiples combinaciones de estas piezas y su eventual conjunci\u00f3n para la resoluci\u00f3n de sus puzles es simplemente soberbia, un trabajo de un gran nivel. \n\n[h1] Una forma diferente de contar historias. [/h1] \n\nEscalando la torre de las emociones. She Remembered Caterpillars evoca a lo m\u00e1s puro de los sentimientos. A lo largo de sus ocho actos plantea diferentes etapas de la vida, siendo el fracaso, la p\u00e9rdida y madures los m\u00e1s recurrentes. Lo complicado que es convivir con las decisiones y lo ef\u00edmera que es la vida en s\u00ed, la importancia de atesorar cada momento como si fuera el ultimo, y de transmitir los sentimientos hacia aquellos que son importantes. \nShe Remembered Caterpillars es una propuesta arriesgada y cautivadora, trata temas muy personales de un modo muy ambiguo y abstracto, tan solo nos encontraremos con breves fragmentos de texto que se introducen de manera pausada como una descripci\u00f3n de aquello que esta por suceder, pero a causa de su naturaleza jugable y lo pragmatico de esta, es complicado determinar si los puzles y el encanto visual forman parte de un medio para interpretar su narraci\u00f3n o simplemente mantiene un prop\u00f3sito preestablecido.\n\n[h1] El cambio que buscamos en el mundo de los videojuegos. [/h1] \n\nEl a\u00f1o reci\u00e9n ha comenzado, y definitivamente, She Remembered Caterpillars tiene todas las cualidades para formar parte del olimpo de los juegos de puzles. Es una grata sorpresa, en su simpleza se oculta un mundo lleno de misterio y conocimiento, repleto de posibilidades. Ante cada una de sus sublimes perspectivas isom\u00e9tricas logra magnificar su potencial y perdurar en lo m\u00e1s profundo de nuestros pensamientos, no solamente por lo rebuscado de sus puzles, ni siquiera por la belleza sin igual de la que tanto entona su mundo de fantas\u00eda, sino por aquella aura de misterio que se desprende, y los sentimientos que nos invaden al interiorizar en cada escenario. \nPara concluir, She Remembered Caterpillars, no es solamente un juego de puzles, es una experiencia mucho m\u00e1s profunda y personal, el anhelo de ense\u00f1anza no solamente l\u00f3gica, sino tambi\u00e9n emocional. Es ese cambio que buscamos en la escena de los videojuegos. \n\n[b]Para leer el analisis completo dirigirse al siguiente enlace:[/b]\n\n[url=https://pcindiemrace.com/2017/01/17/she-remembered-caterpillars-review/] PC Indie Master Race [/url]", "timestamp_created": 1484673727, "timestamp_updated": 1484679171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613067", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39097171": {"recommendationid": "39097171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072447524", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 293, "last_played": 1515220878}, "language": "english", "review": "The whole game is exactly as cute and exquisite as your first glance at it might suggest.

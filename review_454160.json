But that's actually a plus because they were logical puzzles that can be solved with a bit of thought rather than heavily relying on guesswork or searching every screen for something you might have missed. Progress was at a steady pace and I was never stuck for an extended period of time.\n\nThe RPG elements work really well with the game. The protagonist can upgrade weapons and armor and buy items to gradually overcome stronger foes. It's also cleverly implemented: you can grind a little for money and supplies to make things easier, but you can't exactly abuse the system and become overpowered enough to break the game's sequence. There's a good amount of skill involved since you need to time your attacks to deal more damage and know when to use the right items. \n\nAs for the horror aspect of the game, I'm very pleased with how the game sets the proper mood throughout different locations. The pixel art in the game has the right balance between looking retro yet polished enough for contemporary gaming. And the music is spot on for each area/event.\n\nFor those concerned, there are indeed jumpscares. Normally, I'd consider this the cheapest way to try making a game \"scary\" (involutary reflex actions vs. reactions from genuine fear). But surprisingly, I enjoyed them in this case. The game's dark, chilling atmosphere evokes a sense of dread, and it delivers each scare at an appropriate time.\n\nAll in all, a very enjoyable game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1515946384, "timestamp_updated": 1515946384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38978787": {"recommendationid": "38978787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146740846", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514920750}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty decent story.

Suelo recurrir a ellos para buscar opiniones distintas y rese\u00f1as m\u00e1s sinceras de juegos indie. Recuerdo que dieron un comentario muy bueno y breve del juego y por eso me decid\u00ed a comprarlo en alg\u00fan bundle.\n\nDark Fears parece un juego de m\u00f3viles pero no sufri\u00f3 en el traslado a PC. Cuando lo abres, te recibe una peque\u00f1a ventana simulada de DOS, reminiscencia de las aventuras de texto de misterio y horror de los 80. Despu\u00e9s empieza una combinaci\u00f3n de lo nuevo y lo viejo (antialias, m\u00fasica de alta fidelidad, gr\u00e1ficos que simulan los 16 bits) sin violencia alguna. Esto es agradable, pues, porque de repente les da melancolitis a los desarrolladores e insisten tanto en revivir las mec\u00e1nicas de los \u00fanicos y viejos juegos, que eran amables por \u00fanicos, pero no por buenos.\n\nEsto no pasa aqu\u00ed. Al contrario. Primero hablemos un poco de una de las estructuras esenciales de este juego; esta es una aventura textual y, oh dios m\u00edo, tiene sentido. Algunos ejemplos: combina el aceite con la cerradura oxidada para abrirla y atrae a las moscas (de fuego) con la miel. Es l\u00f3gico, sin exagerar. No pide del jugador combinaciones o acertijos exageradamente complicados y cuando llegas a una resoluci\u00f3n, tienen sentido y no abusa de las justificaciones. El jugador observador no perder\u00e1 ninguna pista y no hay recovecos d\u00f3nde esconder las cosas. Si hablas con todos y lees los textos, no tienes por qu\u00e9 perderte. Lo cr\u00edptico no excede las expectativas, pero incluso es satisfactorio cuando le agarras sentido.\n\nLa segunda estructura: los elementos RPG. El personaje principal puede mejorar dos cosas: armadura (salud) y ataque, ambas cuestan dinero. Eventualmente, para juntar el dinero, abrir\u00e1 dos mec\u00e1nicas especiales, que son la caza y la pesca. Obviamente esto es grinding descarado, pero no toma mucho tiempo y puedes aprovechar para curar al personaje (recupera un punto de salud por segundo cuando est\u00e1 quieto y no lo atacan). Quiz\u00e1s, en total, de mis 4 \u00f3 5 horas de juego, una hora y media fue de puro grinding y eso para buscar todos los logros del juego. Menci\u00f3n especial al jaguar, al cu\u00e1l puedes cazar en un bosque oscuro, pero aqu\u00ed en M\u00e9xico est\u00e1 (o estaba) en peligro de extinci\u00f3n (!).\n\nLa historia es convencional, com\u00fan, en cuanto al g\u00e9nero se refiere, pero no est\u00e1 mal. Es el modo de presentarla lo que realmente cuenta. No considero que haya grandes sorpresas, el principio y el final hacen su trabajo, sin grandes decepciones o sorpresas. La prosa tiene algunas redundancias y rodeos que no van al caso, pero son perdonables por el trabajo detallado de los gr\u00e1ficos, la animaci\u00f3n de los mismos y la selecci\u00f3n de la m\u00fasica. La direcci\u00f3n del juego engalana mucho un producto que podr\u00eda ser considerado inferior si solamente de contar una historia se tratara. Dark Fears consigue crear una atm\u00f3sfera interesante y efectiva (\u00a1y es retro-horror!), varias veces me quit\u00e9 los aud\u00edfonos porque sent\u00eda ansiedad por lo que pod\u00eda suceder despu\u00e9s (o sea, s\u00ed me dio chingos de miedo en algunos momentos).\n\nMenci\u00f3n especial a los personajes, aunque son b\u00e1sicos, provocan cierto inter\u00e9s y tienen mucha personalidad. Caso obvio: la muchacha oriental que te vende las pociones y los henna, pero tambi\u00e9n los hombres de negocio, las hijas traicionadas, la reina de hielo, el herrero, el sastre y el loco, tienen un breve desarrollo que los hace un poquito fascinantes. Quiz\u00e1s, lo que no puedo olvidar, es su dise\u00f1o, el cu\u00e1l est\u00e1 bien cuidado y los torna memorables, a\u00fan cuando su papel en el juego es m\u00e1s bien est\u00e1tico. Tienen m\u00e1s personalidad que el personaje principal, lo cu\u00e1l es trist\u00f3n.\n\nEn cuanto al bestiario, tiene sus personajes de horror bien medidos: demonios, brujas, ara\u00f1as gigantes, osos, lobos, goblins, hombres lobo y c\u00edclopes; especialmente \u00e9ste \u00faltimo me alegr\u00f3.

Also, to call it an adventure game doesn\u2019t quite do the game justice. To put the variation of genres on offer in perspective, when I first booted the game up I purposely didn\u2019t read into the background too much as it has been billed as a horror game with a mystery narrative, I thought I\u2019d dive in blindly so as not to stumble across any spoilers whilst researching. Within the first few minutes, I was treated to a Myst-esque abstract puzzle, an \u2018escape-the-room\u2019 section, traditional graphic adventure style elements (collect the object, use an object on another object) and turn-based battling. This was, as the Persians used to say, \u201cA good start\u201d\n\nThe sound design of the game really shines. Some areas feature eerie ambient sounds whilst others sport a keening orchestral score in the background or delicate, disconcerting piano whilst the battle scenes have driving, tribal drums to keep up the adrenaline up during fights. Throughout the game it becomes apparent that some serious time was spent on this aspect, each location having its own accompanying music which varies according to the landscape, ensuring that it never becomes repetitive.\n\nThe narrative of the game is mysterious and gripping enough to keep you enthralled as to what will happen next with tightly scripted dialogue boxes and descriptions adding to the oppressive atmosphere of the game world. Often in indie adventure games there can be issues with grammar or typographical errors which can affect emotional involvement but in Dark Fear, this is not the case, dialogue is suited to each character that you meet and due to the writing style, isn\u2019t laborious to read.\n\nThe puzzles in Dark Fear are quite often pretty straightforward with only a few head-scratchers thrown in. There may be times when you may be stuck with what to do next but for the most part, the text boxes in the game strongly hint as to what your next goal is. Dark fear moves along at a very smooth pace with minimal back-tracking required due to the fast-travel system that activates whenever you have discovered a new location (combined with the graphical style, this reminded me of Crime City on the Amiga) the only exception to the back-tracking is the hunting aspect of the game which was clearly designed primarily for mobile devices. \n\nI must admit there were some times where I felt like I was grinding somewhat to get enough gold to complete the next battle. If I was playing the game on my phone, this would not be an issue as it would be the perfect time-killer for a few minutes on a train journey, whipping out your phone and spending a few minutes tapping away, hunting animals in order to move on, but unfortunately when translated onto the PC, this area of the game is slightly impractical, especially when compared to the rest of Dark Fear which moves along at such a neat pace. It\u2019s one of the few moments in the game I feel could have been trimmed back or revamped for the PC release. A big plus is that there are no random battles in the game, each monster is fought only once which adds variation to the battle system.\n\nWith its foreboding atmosphere, Dark fear keeps the tension ramped, especially in the more claustrophobic areas of the game. Relying less on jump-scares (although there were a few choice moments which were heart-clutchers) and more on an ever-present creepiness which works much to its advantage, especially in a genre where jump scares can sometimes be a poor replacement for decent writing or inventiveness. There\u2019s a Lovecraftian element to the proceedings, a strange empty town cut off from life where people live in fear of an unnameable entity out in the beyond. There\u2019s also a lake in the game with a name that Lovecraft fans will instantly recognise, a nice nod to the game\u2019s literary inspirations.\n\nShould you die in the Dark fear (and you will), you end up back in the cabin where the game began with all items and gold intact. This works well as it removes any need for saving and loading if you make mistakes (and you will). The game can occasionally give you no warning should you accidentally stumble into a battle where you are certain to die in one hit without the correct equipment and so this instant restart is appreciated and well-implemented. \n\nHealth in the game generates over time which again removes the need to back-track too much in order to raise gold to purchase health items. Personally, I got into the habit of going fishing or hunting as my health replenished which was a routine that worked for my play style. \n\nThe sheer variety of locations in the game is quite astonishing, especially when considering that this is a budget title. Quite often low-budget horror games can all be set within one location (which can sometimes work effectively) but this game does have a sense of scale and momentum with each new place that you uncover.\n\nSummary:\nI have spent five hours in the world of Dark Fear and according to my save file I am 81% of the way through the game.

Only way to upgrade your capabilities is to buy weapon and armor upgrades and tatoos by going out and grinding on a swing meter in hunting and fishing mini games. If you don't do this, you can't defeat certain enemies and you can't do extra grinding to make fights easier because the merchants simply won't sell you higher upgrade tiers of gear. The fact that this is intentional is made obvious by the fact that every major enemy has exactly the right number of hp and damge so that once you have the right gear if you hit the swing meters right, you kill them right before they kill you. All the \"rpg elements\" could be removed and the game would be better for it, if 2/3 as long.\nAlso, the writing is so-so.

You definitely have to plan for a good majority of the boss battles, but if things aren\u2019t working out for you, you\u2019re always able to flee and prepare for another attempt. Additionally the game has its own hunting and fishing systems that can be used to farm for cash so that you don\u2019t run into a dead-end situation. Most of the special weapons and magical supplements are easy to understand and have plenty of descriptions or lore hints to help you select the right combination to get the job done. \n\nSome parts of this game were unfortunately, not so great. The horror elements are more jumpscare than anything else and are kind of predictable and the hunting mechanic gets a bit tedious when you just want to catch that one level 4 creature to make the armor you need. These are pretty minor issues though, and didn\u2019t really tarnish the overall experience IMO.\n\nA total play-through of Dark Fear will take you about 5 hours, which might not sound very great but for a $4 game ($2.40 on sale) that\u2019s quite a bargain.

But am I glad I didn't do that, but rather picked it up as a 'might as well try it' during the halloween sale.\n\nAfter playing it, I have to say I'd have bought it at full price. Heck, I can't recommend it enough tbh. The game is rendered in a semi-8-bit graphical style with mouseclick based controls. The music is VERY good, setting just the right mood. Combat is challenging, with a vague rpg flavor, though the game mostly sticks to the adventure setting outside of this. One important other part is the hunting/fishing minigame. Different flavors, but both are essentially the same, but you'll be doing a bit of a rampage on the wildlife in the game to pay for weapon and armor upgrades. Don't forget potions and tattoos either.\n\nThe story keeps you intrigued and there are many locations to visit, monstrous beings to slay and not-so-hidden objects to collect. The downsides though? Well, not everyone might appreciate the art style, there's an awful lot of jumpscares for horror and aside from a math-puzzle the problems needing solving are not too hard.

It's a retro horror adventure and RPG hybrid that's sincerely one of the first of its kind. Think 1980's Kings Quest gameplay mixed with 1990's Pokemon type battles, combined with a Myst point and click interface. On the surface it may seem like a complex amalgamation, but in reality it all works very well together.\n\nYou play as an unnamed man who has awoke in a strange, dark cabin. You have no recollection of how you came to be in this place, and the memories of your past evade you. After escaping from the cabin, you find your way to a small town with a blacksmith, alchemist, tailor, and an unfortunate village idiot; all who will play a role in helping you to uncover the mysteries surrounding your arrival. The only thing that you have to go on is a strange, creepy old portrait that you picked up from the cabin; could this unknown person hold the answers that you so desperately seek?\n\nDark Fear has a thick, aromatic atmosphere that conjures the feeling that one gets when flipping through the yellowed pages of a dusty, old choose your own adventure novel. The game feels genuinely aged, but new all at the same time. Its crude yet enchanting graphics allow your imagination to fill in the details, while still being able to firmly hold an air of suspenseful horror as you explore an abandoned old house, a cemetery, thick forests, and even more locations. Each area holds its own secrets that need to be uncovered, and most have a few battles along the way; whether it be something as simple as a bear or a horrifying boss battle. You really never know what's beyond that next click.\n\nAnother feature that helps the retro vibe stand out in this game is the way that the dialogue is presented. The game utilizes very simple, and large, squares filled with text right in the middle of the screen. While the display is a throwback to oldschool point and clicks, the longevity and high quality of the writing reads like a novel. The story unfolds at a decent pace, and it has enough twists and turns to keep the player engaged at all times. There's also enough backstory to each character that no one would dare call the tale shallow.\n\nBoth the mechanics and gameplay are very straightforward. Click the on-screen arrows to traverse the scenes, click on objects within them to get a closer look and interact, drag and drop items to use them; all simple point and click stuff. Like older adventure games from the 80's, this title has a score system and your end goal is to obtain all of the achievements plus a perfect score of 410. The RPG element comes into play by forcing you to grind for gold by hunting. Gold is used to buy weapon and armor upgrades, as well as potions. Both the hunting and fighting mechanics feature the same click-slider bar, wherein you must click at the perfect moment to make the arrow on the bar stop within the green zone. You will hunt to gather pelts to both sell for gold and use to upgrade your armor, and you can also fish to earn money as well.\n\nThe only real issue with Dark Fear is the amount of grinding involved to get gold. At least once or twice every hour or so of gameplay, you're required to hunt for pelts to upgrade your armor. While that isn't a problem, the only way to make money is to also hunt and fish, leading to a repetitious grind that becomes dreary. At times it can put the player off from wanting to continue with the game, but thankfully the story, soundtrack, and graphics are all worth the effort that one puts in to gold farming.\n\nEven in writing it may sound like these ingredients don't quite fit together well, but trust me when I say that they do in a very unexpected manner. It's really something that one has to experience for themselves to understand and appreciate fully. Dark Fear is a very immersive game, not only within its enjoyable tale of horror and suspense, but also its fantastic retro graphics and absorbing soundtrack. It's also apparently a mobile port, but you would never know that by looking at it or playing it. We, the horror community, need more games like this. It's a shame that this one hasn't become more popular. A definite hidden gem.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]4.5/5.0[/b] - Excellent, highly worth playing.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore", "timestamp_created": 1476352803, "timestamp_updated": 1513693534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606726", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25851074": {"recommendationid": "25851074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015412324", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505486130}, "language": "german", "review": "Dark Fear ist ein sehr gutes Spiel, welches vorrangig durch seine dunkle Story\nund d\u00fcstere Atmosph\u00e4re \u00fcberzeugt.

X-D\nNel ruolo di avventura grafica, ogni ambientazione di gioco \u00e8 costituita da una schermata statica nella quale \u00e8 possibile agire con il mouse: si interagisce con gli elementi presenti, si raccolgono oggetti, si combinano eventualmente nell'inventario, si utilizzano nella locazione corrente. Come RPG, nel villaggio iniziale \u00e8 possibile acquistare armature, armi e pozioni, per affrontare i vari nemici che il gioco ci scaglia contro per ucciderci. Il combattimento \u00e8 a turni (prima noi, poi il nemico, quindi nuovamente noi, e cos\u00ec via finch\u00e9 uno dei due non \u00e8 a terra), e si avvale di un sistema di attacco alquanto semplice: una freccia scorre avanti e indietro lungo un indicatore, e si ferma non appena clicchiamo con il mouse. Pi\u00f9 questa \u00e8 vicina al centro, pi\u00f9 danni causeremo: un centro perfetto permette di infliggere il 100% dei danni dell'arma, per poi scendere a 75% e arrivare, infine, allo 0% (bersaglio mancato). Una nota particolare va fatta per alcuni boss, che richiedono di essere affrontati con una preparazione \"particolare\", dato che hanno moltissimi punti vita e sono dotati di attacchi o poteri speciali che li rendono quasi impossibili da sconfiggere normalmente: dato che l'arma del protagonista \u00e8 una balestra, per aumentare i danni \u00e8 possibile acquistare dardi speciali, costruiti con materiali contro cui questi nemici sono deboli, mentre in difesa \u00e8 possibile farsi tatuare dei simboli arcani sul corpo, in modo da nullificare le abilit\u00e0 speciali di questi boss. Infine, \u00e8 bene sottolineare che NON esistono \"incontri casuali\" contro i nemici: sono TUTTI prefissati. Ci\u00f2 significa anche che per fare soldi, necessari per comprare l'equipaggiamento, \u00e8 necessario ricorrere a un altro espediente: la caccia e la pesca. In alcuni luoghi specifici \u00e8 infatti possibile dedicarsi a queste due attivit\u00e0 tramite una sorta di minigioco (solita freccia che scorre su un indicatore, solo che stavolta bisogna cliccare su tutti i punti verdi ivi presenti). Tra parentesi la caccia \u00e8 comunque necessaria per le armature, perch\u00e9 per ottenerle, oltre ai soldi, sono richieste anche determinate pelli o parti di animali specifici, per cui vi ci dedicherete necessariamente per sopravvivere.\nPer il resto tanto horror ben congegnato, con una grafica che personalmente trovo molto bella nel suo stile retr\u00f2 ricercato e, attenzione, con una colonna sonora alquanto azzeccata (la musica dei combattimenti poi \u00e8 un capolavoro).\nPer quanto riguarda i difetti, in primis, in assoluto, la lunghezza: personalmente l'ho finito in circa 4 ore, e ho ottenuto pure il 100% degli achievements. :-/ In secondo piano, dato che gli scontri casuali non esistono, il dover necessariamente basarsi su caccia e pesca per guadagni extra \u00e8 noioso

Even including the classic white score bar at the top of the screen! You click around and try to solve the mystery of where you are and why you woke up there, by collecting clues, pushing evil spirits out of their haunted houses and interviewing the residents of a small village. This part is all good and enjoyable, especially if you're oldschool enough to have played some of the game that inspired this one.\n\nThe problem is that the story is pretty bad, including possibly the worst twist of all time. You shouldn't burst out laughing at the twist in a horror game, which I did. Second, the game goes too far with its economy and forces you to stop and grind at several points in the game. If the hunting and fishing minigames had actually been fun, that wouldn't have been a problem, but it's a ridiculously simple system that must feel shallow even on mobile.\n\nAdventuring and solving mysteries with clues is the good part of this game, and there is a decent amount of it, but the game is weighed down by the grinding and in-game economy. I wish Steam had a neutral option here, because I'd place this game squarely in that category; fun if you can tolerate grinding, probably not worth it if you don't want to \"hunt\" in a simple minigame for hours.

In pixelate retro graphics, which pays homage to classics from the Sierra, creating a small drama that puts you in the poor and unenviable situation.\n\nYou find yourself in an abandoned hut, can\u2019t see a thing, the entrance doors are nailed and you don\u2019t know what is happening. After the first introduction to the mechanics of the game you get out realizing that you are somewhere deep in the forest and mostly do not know who you are. The aim is to find out something about yourself, about the strange events and creatures you meet, and above all survive \u2026 oh and who\u2019s that creepy guy in a picture inside that hut.\n\nClassic point & click adventure puzzles are followed by mini-games, like QTE, where you need to hunt and fish, so you can earn gold. With the money in town, where you will keep coming back, you can buy potions, protective spells and unlock better weapons and armor. Everything you need for next mini-game - fights. They are turn-based where you can attack, defend or use a potion. In the course of the game you can also choose the type of weapon used. Some monsters can be killed with only certain weapons and moreover it\u2019s necessary to use a protective spell against their special ability. Combat system slightly reminds an old game Elvira (older gamers remember). Most opponents are coming as the story progress and therefore it\u2019s necessary to first obtain the equipment needed to defeat them. In a classical adventure journey it\u2019s a very nice RPG like feature.\n\nNeedless to say, the Dark Fear thrives to capture the atmosphere of the forest and 80\u2019s games of this genre with nice retro stylization. Conversely, artworks nicely illustrate the gloomy atmosphere and there\u2019s no a downside that the game was originally released on the mobile platform.\n\nDark Fear could be described as bite-sized experience, since it lasts up to four or five hours. Considering the price and content of the game it\u2019s an enjoyable title and I can recommend it to fans of adventure games and dark stories.\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

It contains a fairly interesting story as you the take the role of a man with no memory battling evil in strange world that I can only describe as a bit of a mix between a sort of American frontier gothic horror, along with a bit of medieval mystic fantasy. It relies on a few cliches but it feels pretty imaginative for the most part. A few moments in the game are geinunely startling when first encountered.\n\nAwaking in a dark cabin with no memory, your main goal becomes to eventually try to recover the truth of why you're here while you go about gathering all the map and amulet pieces scattered throughout the world - by solving a number of puzzles and battling monsters, wild animals, witches, and demons. You earn an assortment of armor, weapons, items, and other abilities throughout the game to assist you in fights with the use of gold. You earn gold at the end of battles but your primary source of earning money is from selling the game you catch in hunting and fishing. Success in battles relies mainly on planning ahead and being able to time your strikes to maximize damage. It's all really rather simple. Some of the final few encounters try to make things a bit more difficult by changing up the arrow speed in order to make it more challenging to deal a critical blow. Even if you're defeated in battle the game starts you instantly back at the Cabin without losing any progress or items you've already collected.  \n\nMost of the achievements unlock as you advance the story but a few can be missed if you're not paying attention to them and save the game to far along to go back. It's also best to play this game as it suggests, with headphones and in a dark quiet place to get the maximum enjoyment out of it. \n\nIt requires a certain amount of grinding but nothing to overwhelming. I honestly didn't mind the hunting and fishing, which I found to be sort of a relaxing rest point inbetween exploring and battles. The end revelation is fairly surprising if not a little bit silly. The ending tries to tie together most of your encounters but I feel like it could have been better if things weren't so simplified. I felt some of these things could have been better just left unsaid in the end. Sometimes the best parts of these games were what it allowed your own imagination to fill in. \n\nOverall Dark Fear has alot of the same charm splashed with a bit of cheesiness that made these games fun to play. You're probably looking at around 3-5 hours of gameplay total which isn't to bad for a game in this price range.

The retro style graphics were great, and the story kept me engaged enough to want to finish this game over the course of two sittings. None of the puzzles were very difficult, and the jump scares were more so fun than frightening. Overall, I enjoyed about 90% of this experience totally. \n\nMy only real gripe with the game is that the hunting/shop mechanic felt like it was put in there just to pad out the length of the game. The game is 4-5 hours long, and you spend at least an hour of that hunting things to earn gold so you can upgrade your load out. You have to do this, if you do not then you will encounter enemies that will simply one shot you. Of course, the game never ends with you dying...just like any good point and click...but you still end up wasting a ton of time hunting or fishing for gold. I get it, it is sort of a practice for combat since there is no pressure while hunting/fishing - but you could have just as easily given the player the necessary items to win through puzzle solving or because they need things like potions and are friendly to the NPCs. The game still would have been extremely enjoyable if it was only a 2-3 hour experience in old school horror gaming. \n\nSo, in spite of the grindy bits this is still a really solid game. It has enough charm that I can sit there clicking on pictures of animals for a while in order to progress the combat portions of the story.

It's so much deeper than that.\n\nWhen playing, you'll discover a multi-faceted, horror-fantasy adventure with very light RPG elements that will provide a good 4-5 hour play time.\n\nYou wake up in a dark cabin with no memory of how you got there.  Start clicking and use items, and after getting out of the cabin you will happen upon a village where your adventure really begins.  From this point on, you'll embark on a very atmospheric and interesting adventure that, while it may not blow you away, will keep your interest to the end without feeling like a slog.\n\nThe graphics are very late-80s to early-90s pixel art, all of which are very well done and work to keep the environment creepy without feeling like they're trying too hard.  Through the game, you'll feel like there's a mix of medieval fantasy and early 1900s worlds colliding, which to me just adds to the charm of the game.  It really harkens back to the days when games didn't take themselves too terribly serious, and were out to entertain you and not be co-opted by hyper-political nitwits that think every game has to double as a commentary on society.\n\nThe RPG elements are very simple in both execution and progression.  You can hunt for pelts, which can be used for better armor, increasing your hit points.  There is no grind fighting or levelling up, although you may spend more time than you'd like hunting for certain pelts needed for later armors in the game, which based on the very-scripted path of battles you'll face, you'll need to get better armor before you can progress at certain points.\n\nAs for the horror aspect, it is well-executed.  Scenarios meant to be creepy pull it off well, and the music helps (The developer was even kind enough to explain the music is copyrighted, and offered an option to turn it off as a nod to content streamers who may face DMCA takedowns if they record a Youtube video with the music on).\n\nAll in all, for $4.00, you're getting a competently made horror-adventure game that really captures the feel of old sierra adventures.

The story is uncluttered and plain-spoken, which makes it effective. It's taken from obvious story tropes, but doesn't force you to read some endless soap opera or pretentious extended monologue.

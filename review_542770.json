Castle Must Be Mine arriva nella mia libreria per ultimo per la sua lunga gestazione early access, dato che non amo comprare giochi finiti a met\u00e0 e di questo strumento si \u00e8 sfortunatamente abusato, almeno per ci\u00f2 che riguarda il VR, creando spiacevoli effetti e titoli che giacciono in stato di abbandono.\n\nIl gioco, lo dico subito, \u00e8 delizioso. Sebbene dal punto di vista della realizzazione tecnica e del budget non sia alla pari dei pi\u00f9 coreografici Tethered o Siegecraft Commander, Castle Must Be Mine usa la realt\u00e0 virtuale ma soprattutto le possibilit\u00e0 del roomscale e dell'handtracking (ovvero camminare e afferrare le cose) meglio di qualsiasi altro strategico. Questo splendido risultato lo si \u00e8 ottenuto pensando fin dalla sua genesi il titolo come un gioco da tavolo, infatti lo scenario di battaglia \u00e8 proprio un tavolo di dimensioni analoge ad uno di biliardo. Non solo: l'intera mappa di gioco \u00e8 concepita per essere efficacemente utilizzata stando da un lato specifico del tavolo, quindi anche senza avere spazi enormi (e senza necessita di un tracking a 360 gradi) si ha assolutamente l'impressione di giocare di fronte ad un meraviglioso plastico con cannoni e piccoli soldati poligonali.\n\nL'eccellente concezione del gioco come titolo per realt\u00e0 virtuale la si evince anche dall'interfaccia. Non serve alcun tipo di spiegazione per giocare, si usano due bottoni (la cui funzione \u00e8 raffigurata nel controller) e praticamente ogni operazione \u00e8 un oggetto fisico da toccare. Non solo: a parte l'azione tower defence, ci sono geniali contenuti addizionali che aumentano ancora di pi\u00f9 il coinvolgimento. Si possono lanciare palle di fuoco, prendendole dallo scenario e lanciandole con le proprie mani, o immergerci occasionalmente nella prospettiva del gioco entrando nel castello per tirare i massi a due mani contro l'esercito invasore. Non manca anche un \"eroe\" da usare come difesa mobile, da piazzare nella mappa con tanto di energia e punti esperienza.\n\nDopo esserci sincerati sulla bont\u00e0 ed ergonomia del gioco, vediamo i contenuti. Trattasi di un classico tower defence, dove le regole di gioco sono assai semplificate, ma il livello di difficolt\u00e0 \u00e8 invece solido. E' sempre difficile gestire difficolt\u00e0 e frustrazione: per esempio Evil Robot Traffic Jam, analogo tower defence per VR, \u00e8 ben fatto ma eccede nella difficolt\u00e0 risultando presto poco interessante. Qui ci sono invece dei livelli \"cuscinetto\" dove si pu\u00f2 vincere con un basso livello di strategia, ma da un certo punto in poi i nemici saranno semplicemente troppi, e servir\u00e0 spendere i vostri crediti con la massima ponderazione per massimizzare il danno.\n\nIl prezzo riflette il livello della realizzazione, \u00e8 un gioco fatto da un piccolo team, con assets poligonali carini ma semplici ed una qualit\u00e0 tipicamente indie. L'eventuale amante del dettaglio pu\u00f2 storcere il naso nei primi minuti, ma dopo poco se vi piace il genere \u00e8 davvero difficile farci caso, il gioco \u00e8 troppo ben congegnato e passerete il vostro tempo a spostare l'eroe, erigere fortificazioni e lanciare palle infuocate.

As a result I like this game, and I think it's a pretty good start for VR tower defence. But, if I have to be honest, as a tower defence - it's really quite rudimentry. There are only 3 tower types (arrow, magic, and cannon). The balance between the towers seems to be strange also [spoiler](cannon towers seem quite underpowered compared to the others, usually the mission goes better if you ignore them or only build 1)[/spoiler]. You also have a hero which can draw aggro of a single enemy to keep them from advancing. There is also a spell that can be cast such as a tornado or a fireball. And finally, the castle itself usually has some sort of defence of last resort (such as boulders or a cannon), with limited ammo.\n\nThe draw of this game is that there are moments when things get pretty hectic. The player will be building towers, casting spells, managing their hero, and occasionally jumping into their tower to use their weapon of last resort.\n\nIt's fun, but it is somewhat limited in strategy and does get a little repetitive.\n\nI think the devs should put in more tower types, such as flame towers that hit in a line, or lightning towers that can chain attacks, and frost towers that can slow. Maybe implement temporary powerups for towers. Additional hero types, or powers would also be useful so that there are different ways of defeating each level.

Classic towers, a minion you can move around to temporarily stop monsters in their tracks, a good set of enemies. It's good as it is, and has huge potential.\n\nThere are some small bugs (misbehaviors, from my perspective) that make it a little difficult to get three stars on a map. These are all things I think have contributed to me frustratingly losing lives. \n\nI've found when dropping the fireball, sometimes it bounces in an unexpected way off the table. I try to \"place\" it on the table instead of throwing it, but it's hard when I'm rushing to kill enemies.\n\nAnother thing is I think the magic towers shot doesn't always make it to the monster. Sometimes (1 of 25) it seems like the magic ball hits something on its way to the enemy (sometimes the tower itself if the enemy is close to the base). This can be a big deal for a wave, and might mean an enemy goes through.\n\nOne last small thing, is I wish I could move the minion closer to the castle where enemies are moving to. Sometimes I'll quickly try to grab and place him by the castle (I'm fairly sure I pick him up correctly, as I feel the vibration in my controller) but when I let go, he doesn't teleport there.

He will engage one creature at a time, locking it in place to allow your towers to shoot at it for longer. \nYou also get a fireball/meteor spell attack that recharges, and later levels give you a limited supply of boulders to chuck down at enemies closing in on your castle.  I found the boulders to be fairly underwhelming considering the limited supply you get, but they do push enemies back if you just need a few extra seconds for your towers to whittle them down, so they can be useful. The fireball/meteor is fun, although its damage seems pretty paltry. I am also a rather terrible shot with it, so I wouldn't mind some sort of aiming reticle or texture on the ground to show where the attack will hit, but I could also just \"get gud\" and aim better.\nThere are multiple enemy types, especially by the last currently available level.  You've got fast guys, slow guys, guys who take less damage from magic, all sorts of things.  Good variety.

I think the controls are fairly obvious, though the icon for the magic tower looks like a bow and arrow to me. The main mechanic that sets this apart as a tower defense game is the soldier you control that can be used to engage the enemies and either clump them up or string them out, depending on your choice of cannons vs magic (magic seems to be strongest atm). Everytime you pick him up and drop him next to an enemy, he takes a swing at the enemy and the enemy stops and attacks back. If you leave him be, he'll continue to fight that one enemy with an attack every few seconds. If you pick him back up and drop him right away, he'll take another swing without waiting. Maybe it's exploity, but it feels intentional because you get to micromanage this one guy while the towers run on autopilot. Also he gets XP every time he hits, so spamming the hits really helps later on.\n\nAlso there are fireballs you can pick up and throw at the enemies. It takes a while to recharge, but you hear when it does so it doesn't sit there going to waste.\n\nIf you like tower defense games, this is a worthwhile VR adaptation of the genre.

I'm a huge fan of Kittypocalypse which set the bar pretty high but this game has its own perks which I really enjoyed that set it apart. \n\nThe movement and controls in this game are extremely simple. You can pretty much access the entire table standing in one position the whole time; but it is fun to walk around during the waves and look closer at the guys fighting and stuff. I like the little hero dude you can control, he is a neat addition to this type of game which you can move around and use to play crowd control as needed. The three tower types keep things simple and are upgradable later on. There's also a fireball thing you can chuck at guys that spawns on a magic tower which I REALLY enjoyed. After its used another one spawns on a timer; it comes with maps automatically after level 1 so no need to spend extra moneys for it. The big rock that you throw with two hands I was really suprised to see and I had a BLAST chucking it off the castle wall at the bad guys. I could totally see this game being a hit maybe for kids or anyone that finds Kittypocalypse too complicated. \n \nOne thing I would like to see is more tower types like maybe a catapult that launches a rock and does good AOE damage with a long range (I've only made it through the first 3 or 4 levels so it's possible they come later in game?). I also think it would be great if you could control the little hero dude in first person view like you can in Out Of Ammo. :) Also, I think it would be cool if there was an animation that went with hero when you pick him up to move him (like he sits there wiggling around while your holding him by his helmet or something.)\n\nThere are a lot of early access VR games out that cost more than they are worth at the time of release. I think they did a great job pricing this game at release and would recommend people try it out.", "timestamp_created": 1479318180, "timestamp_updated": 1479318180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

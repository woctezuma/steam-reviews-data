Just disappointing.\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nYou\u2019re a dude who has an alien stuck in his brain and now he has telekinesis and mind reading and a bad guy is after the alien. The story is pretty simple and overall, it progresses at a good pace. Each level has a mini story and an overall mission. Each character you interact with is a piece of this overall mission and you do the standard adventure game logic of \u201cget item, place item, reward\u201d.\n\nHowever, the characters are kind of boring. Each one only has one trait and they usually disappear after one area so they don\u2019t feel interesting. Each one spurts 1 or 2 lines and except for one joke referencing the godfather, I didn\u2019t laugh at all. I didn\u2019t know much about these characters and I didn\u2019t want to.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nIt\u2019s an adventure game. Talk to people, collect items, repeat. In this case, you collect stickers which you can apply to other characters and objects. However, the gameplay isn\u2019t super deep. With one exception, each sticker is used exactly once and it\u2019s not challenging at all. Just make an entire trip through the level talking to everyone on the way and they will literally tell you what sticker they need most of the time. \n\nThere are also platforming sections but the only challenge is the fact that dudes chase you through the section if they see you. In the later levels, it gets pretty tedious because you basically have to stand in a particular location, place a sticker on a dude, and run for it. It\u2019s trial and error rather than anything fun. \n\n[h1]Graphics/Performance: (with a 970, 4790K, 16GB of RAM, SSD)[/h1]\nThe art style of paper in a 3D environment is just fantastic and it really is super creative visually. Not a fan of the characters personally but I can see that a lot of love went into the visuals. The voice acting is varied and there are a lot of characters but see above for boring characters. Ran great and never crashed.\n \n[h1]Final Thoughts:[/h1]\nIt\u2019s really not bad and normally I wouldn\u2019t mind something like this but the story was just super uninteresting.

Levels are long, self-contained 2.5 platforming sets, like The Cave. Single level puzzles ensure that everything will be wrapped up neatly and that there will never be a challenge. There aren\u2019t even red herring puzzle items, like The Cave. Puzzles are extremely obvious due to the mind reading effect, which tells you the answer.\nFor example: A dog says, \u201cI wish I had teeth so I could bite these dudes\u201d and by sheer coincidence you have a crocodile tooth sticker. \nThere are only two scenarios in which you'll have a spare item and both of those are used for achievement related side-puzzles. The result is a puzzle game with no challenging puzzles. \n\nThe jokes are really hit or miss and a lot of them are references. Yes, you did a Mario joke, well done; that horse was beaten into a red paste 20 years ago, what else do you got? Aside from \u201chumorous\u201d observations, the game's other running joke is giving animals antiquated Shakespearean accents and vocabularies that can only be discovered by reading their minds. It's funny the first time, but when every single animal talks like a Victorian-era art critic, it loses its charm faster than a Leprechaun on speed. \n\nProbably the biggest difference between The Cave and Stick it to the Man is the atmosphere. The Cave took place in dark empty areas with one or two NPCs. Stick it to the Man occurs in large city environments and is based on quietly helping other characters solve their problems. I was actually really impressed by one aspect: Most puzzles have a running theme of repairing unlikely relationships. Unfortunately, that's the game's only real source of inspiration and, paired with the frankly huge cast of one-dimensional characters, the atmosphere loses its charm faster than a Leprechaun on speed. \n\nThe voice acting is just terrible. Let me explain. In voice work, characters have funny voices; funny voices don\u2019t make characters. With little exception, every character has a similarly overextended speech pattern and a wacky accent which proves to be more distracting than funny or immersive. \nThe main character's voice sounds like a cheese grater with a New York accent. \nIn fairness though, some of the worst voice work comes from horrific dialogue writing. \nYou\u2019ll hear \u201cI should have not stayed up all night LAST NIGHT eating burritos, yet I have no regret about eating burritos all night,\u201d and similar lines about micro-naps dozens and dozens of times. This attempt at humor (its not really a joke) would only have been funny once, but the game design forces you to commit the greatest sin in all of comedy games: repeating the joke over and over and over and over again. It loses its charm faster than a Leprechaun on speed. \n\nDr. Brom (who is based on Dr. Monroe from The Simpsons), the taxidermist, blue haired radio operator, and the mother are the only consistently good character voices in the entire game. \nRay (the PC) and Ted (the alien that lives inside his head) are the worst voices, by far.\n\nYet even the voice acting cannot compare to the hideous \"plot\" of this game. From the get go, the plot is essentially the PC being chased by bad guys. There's an apparent mystery with a psychologist (who Ray has never met before) but it doesn't go anywhere. Despite having a huge set up, nothing in this game's storyline has any pay off.  The antagonist makes a number of intro-cutscene apperances, but they don't amount to anything. You make it to the end of your 3 hour journey and nothing is gained. You don't know why the bad guy is evil and neither does he. Once he finally gets what he wants he say something to the effect of \"Why did I do this anyway?\" The antagonist is as confused as the player. The result is a comedy puzzle game that fails to be funny and has no interesting puzzles, but does have a host of one-dimensional characters, terrible voice acting, and a nonsense plot (even for a game that takes place in a world of stickers and cardboard). \n\n$15 for 3 hours of terrible puzzles, terrible writing, terrible voice acting, and a terrible story.", "timestamp_created": 1499286160, "timestamp_updated": 1502083496, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33169960": {"recommendationid": "33169960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272414763", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499055457}, "language": "english", "review": "This is such a great game.

But I think \"Weird Wavy Purple Hand Sticking out of Head and sticking various stickers onto other objects and backgrounds\" would have been too long of a title.\n\nAnyway, this is my first time really reviewing a game (I'm mostly a film reviewer, so I'm sorry if I seem a bit out of touch and this review itself being all over the place) and I figured it would be of one I got during the big sale recently and thought was worth talking about. \n\nI never heard of this game until the sale and even then, I did it mostly because it was cheap and thought it looked cute enough. \"Stick it to The Man\" tells the story of Ray, a guy who lives in a world made up entirely out of paper materiel and stickers. After getting hit on the head, he suddenly wakes up with a big purple hand sticking out of his head and now has the ability to read minds and pull down various objects in the backgrounds and foregrounds. \n\nIt's pretty straight forward in terms of gameplay: grab objects, stick them to others, run, jump, read minds of anyone to figure out what thing to stick on them, etc and etc. \n\nOh, and you also must avoid being caught by henchmen of \"The Man\" in these small segments that appear every now and then in chapters, along with using your purple hand to grab onto thumbtacks as a grappling hook. \n\nIt's decently done and kept me playing, but it's nothing I doubt many familiar with adventure games or platformers will think is breaking any new grounds. Puzzles are fairly easy to figure out (but still rather fun to do so) and for the most part, the levels go by in a snap if you know what you need to do with certain stickers and characters.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, Gameplay doesn't really seem to main focus of the team behind this. The main focus seems to be mostly on the various types of quirky characters and very odd scenarios/solutions for puzzles and see how many laughs they can get out of the player. \n\nI can't really say this game is flat out hilarious or even THAT much nuanced to the weird comedy genre, but there's something oddly charming about it.\n\nThe art direction looks like \"The Simpsons\" meets \"Psychonauts\" with this odd cardboard and paper aesthetic that's equal parts fun to look at and very bizarre, along with the soundtrack, which is pretty fun too (give \"Get me a Shrink!\" a listen to if you're in the mood for some funky jazz)\n\nThe writing in general kept me consistently chuckling and laughing through, but I dunno, it all feels.......token? Like, I've felt like I've seen these types of punchlines before but I can't put my finger on where exactly (it could be Matt Groening, Tim Schafer, or Dan Povenmire, but it could be something else entirely), but they're still funny and it made me want to see where it would go next. \n\nVoice acting is pretty solid across the broad, but there's some moments (mostly during jokes) that the timing of the punchlines feel a bit off, which for a comedy game is a pretty big fail, but it doesn't happen as often as I was dreading. \n\nThe weird characters you meet throughout the journey are pretty interesting to watch in the \"what the hell is going to be the outcome for him/her?\" sorta way and the game itself ends on a fairly nice punchline. \n\nIf there's any other issue in regards to gameplay, I would say the segments with the henchmen get pretty tedious after awhile and it's often annoying to be reading the mind of one, only to then have them walk out of the frame you can do so as they charge over to you, with a small delay between moments of getting in control again.\n\nI would say as well it's A BIT over priced (?) for four hours of standard Adventure Game stuff if that's what you're looking for, but if you're looking for a breezy, simple, and charming little time killer, stick this one into your chart.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1483567428, "timestamp_updated": 1483567601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503812", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28961250": {"recommendationid": "28961250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097951439", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483394475}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a  great little game (~5hrs)  that felt like a cross between The Cave and Psychonauts.

The mind reading, platforming, adventure, stealth and paper tearing mechanics take chances and fit great together. Add funny writing, great voice acting, memorable characters, a great style and a superb soundtrack and its a wholly fun time. A minus point is that some of the puzzles verge on moon logic and some items don't work when they feel they should. For instance, near the beginning of the game there are two puzzles that revolve around teeth going on at the same time, so which solution fit where was a bit confusing.

However, I did not regret my purchase of this game at all. Worst case scenario for you: Just buy it on sale, and you should have no issues.\n\nThis game is so unique and drew me in much more than I expected. The story, from a high-level perspective, is a bit cheesy, and the villain of the game is also somewhat annoying and lacks thrill, BUT that is intentional to fit with the overall style of the game. It is really off-the-wall, filled with random silly jokes and a good bit of dark humor (a couple of places are surprisingly dark), but it all flowed together, in an intentionally messy way.\n\nThe art is in this paper and sticker format, which actually was done in such a way that I enjoyed it very much. It was not tacky at all. Everything is very well drawn, and a good amount of the level design and characters have this interesting sort of dreary, grimy look. Some items, buildings, people, and so on, are brighter and stand out from everything else that has a background tone or shading, but the background itself is really detailed and by all means should be looked at just as much as the stuff with which you interact.\n\nThe theme song of the game was a very good pick, and the sounds and music as you play are pretty simple in most places, but also enjoyable. I did not have a problem with anything that I heard in the game. Then you have the voice acting, which was amazing. So many characters voiced by a small amount of people, and they were definitely unique as well. I didn't notice any characters sounding too close to each other.\n\nThe game itself is split into chapters, or essentially levels, and you must explore the levels and solve small puzzles where other characters are wanting specific objects. You must find the objects either lying around somewhere, or by obtaining them from other characters. As you help certain characters out, they will sometimes do things like break/open doors for you to continue on in the level, or end up giving you another item that you will have to figure out how to use. While the general idea is simple or not necessarily exciting, the game really benefits from its style as mentioned above, as well as the actual gameplay of how you will do the puzzle-solving.\n\nYour character, Ray, has an accident and ends up with a weird arm sticking out of his head, which in and of itself allows for the gameplay. The game is an interesting mix of platforming and point-and-click, where you use your mouse to control the arm and grab objects that you need, as well as do something stranger: read other characters' minds. When you read their minds, you will sometimes just hear thoughts and jokes, while other times will give you hints about what to currently do in a level (e.g., what a character might be looking for), or even end up having a character release a thought cloud which contains an item that you can grab and carry with you.\n\nDon't worry, though: You shouldn't get bored by the above, as the level design and characters are very interesting (as I know I have said multiple times so far), and just about every time you give an item to someone, a cutscene will occur showing some wacky events happening that will very likely make you laugh (assuming you enjoy the humor of the game). Hence, I had fun every single minute of the game, running around and figuring out what to do with so many weird items and people you encounter.\n\nAgain, I will say that the game surprised me. I watched some of the trailers and thought it seemed really odd, and maybe funny, but I didn't go in with any fancy expectations. It turned out to be a lot more than what I felt while watching the trailers. So, unless you absolutely hate the scenes in the trailers, I would say to give the game a chance, even if you are on the fence or somewhat unsure. I expect that you will also be surprised like I was.

Developed by indie studio [b]Zoink Games[/b] and published by [b]Ripstone[/b], this game was quite a surprise for me. It tells the story of a mediocre guy named Ray, who gains the ability to read people's minds. He gets into a pretty 'sticky' ([i]god, forgive me[/i]) situation, as the reason for his telepathic abilities is something which is highly sought after. The game introduces the antagonist and his minions, who you have to avoid at all cost, seeing as you are still in the body of an average dude. As you can probably guess - the aforementioned abilities are the key to this. The story is written in a very funny way and I found the dialogues to be insanely enjoyable. I can say that the story made me laugh several times.\nThe gameplay is pretty interesting, as you have to gather items to proceed. This makes you explore the world, which is adorable and full with stories. The only quirk that the game has are the little points in levels, where you meet the baddies. You have some cool techniques to avoid them, but sometimes those scenes are a bit frustrating to manoeuvre through. Since they are not that many and the game unlocks a kind of \"fast travel system\", it is easy to forgive that. The puzzles are really innovative and fun.\nThe art-style is somehow gorgeous. Yes, the figures are really ugly, but this kind of grotesque depiction really makes them amicable. The world has a Little-Big-Planet-kind-of-look, since everything seems to be made out of cardboard. The music is perfect, the cool jazz tunes don't make you hurry up your gameplay. The only thing is that sometimes the dialouge gets a bit messed up, but it hasn't been anything all too tragic. You can turn on subtitles anyway.\nAs a whole, I have to say that this game was a nice experience. It is very comparable to [i]Psychonauts[/i], but with a heavier focus on the adventure, than on the platforming.

The art style and soundtrack are immediately appealing. The story is humorous, weird, and actually pretty dark at times; but it tells it's story without ever taking itself too seriously.\n\nThe gameplay itself is also fun and interesting. It's mostly split into two catergories: stealth/eluding segments and exploration puzzle solving segments. The stealth segments are fun, with you grappling around with your sticky mind hand to elude guards. The exploration is my favorite part though. It's extremely satisfying going around solving people's problems in order to help yourself get further. There's nver a dull moment, and characters always have something interesting to say.\n\nI'd recommend this game. In terms of length, it's pretty short.

Ninguno de los dos, \"Stick It To The Man!\" es un juego que se queda a medio camino entre ambos g\u00e9neros, y que gustar\u00e1 a los seguidores de ambos por igual.\n\nEn \u00e9l manejamos a Ray, un pobre currante que ha hecho de probar cascos de seguridad su profesi\u00f3n, y que sufre un ir\u00f3nico accidente mientras vuelve a su casa tras el trabajo: Un misterioso (y contundente) objeto cae del cielo y le deja inconsciente.\nCuando despierta, Ray descubre que algo ha cambiado. De repente es capaz de escuchar los pensamientos ajenos. Pero no solo eso, si no que tambi\u00e9n ser\u00e1 capaz de modificarlos (mediante la ingeniosa jugabilidad), e incluso de utilizar los pensamientos de otros para \"materializar\" objetos a su antojo.\nA partir de aqu\u00ed, la historia se basar\u00e1 en averiguar qu\u00e9 le ha pasado exactamente a nuestra cabeza, y por qu\u00e9 somos repentinamente buscados por unos agentes trajeados.\nTodo est\u00e1 narrado en tono de humor, con geniales di\u00e1logos y multitud de momentos muy graciosos, que nos har\u00e1n esbozar m\u00e1s de una sonrisa mientras nos preguntamos c\u00f3mo terminar\u00e1 la historia.\n\nEl aspecto gr\u00e1fico del juego es otra se\u00f1a de identidad del mismo. Todo el mundo de \"Stick It To The Man!\" est\u00e1 creado mediante cartones y pegatinas. El resultado es una delicia, con escenarios tridimensionales por los que nos moveremos con un scroll lateral, y personajes y elementos en 2D situados en ellos.\nEl dise\u00f1o es original, divertido, y muy muy trabajado (no hay dos lugares ni dos personajes iguales, si exceptuamos a los enemigos), y se nota en ciertos puntos una influencia de Psychonauts (adem\u00e1s de haber alguna que otra referencia al juego). Termina siendo uno de esos juegos en que el simple hecho de querer ver m\u00e1s escenarios ya justifica el seguir avanzado.\n\nLa jugabilidad va de la mano con el dise\u00f1o de los escenarios. Los poderes mentales de Ray est\u00e1n representados por una mano rosada (con aspecto de chicle) que le sale de la cabeza (y que nadie m\u00e1s puede ver). Con esta mano, que podremos controlar, seremos capaces de leer la mente de otros personajes, de recoger objetos del escenario (que reconoceremos por su forma de pegatina), e incluso de agarrar por ejemplo la fachada de papel de un edificio y desprenderla para ver qu\u00e9 hay en su interior.\nLos objetos que encontremos pasar\u00e1n a formar parte de nuestro inventario, y deberemos usarlos d\u00f3nde corresponda para ir solucionando puzzles y poder continuar. Adem\u00e1s de los que encontremos por el escenario, podremos incluso leer la mente a otros personajes que est\u00e9n pensando en un objeto y \"coger\" ese objeto de su mente para usarlo a nuestro antojo, lo cual aumenta mucho las posibilidades.\nA este aspecto de aventura gr\u00e1fica (muy sencilla) hay que a\u00f1adirle las partes de plataformeo y huida de enemigos. En el juego seremos perseguidos por una serie de enemigos en varios momentos, a los que no podremos derrotar. Sin embargo podremos darles esquinazo (temporalmente) de varias formas. Por ejemplo, podemos leer la mente de un enemigo que est\u00e1 pensando en dormir y \"tomar\" esa idea de su mente para pon\u00e9rsela a otro, que caer\u00e1 dormido. O podemos \"tomar\" la imagen de nuestra cara de un enemigo que nos est\u00e9 buscando para poner esa imagen en la cara de otro enemigo, de modo que los dem\u00e1s le persigan creyendo que se trata de nosotros.\nAmbas partes, tanto la de puzzles como la de plataformeo, son m\u00e1s bien sencillas durante la mayor parte del juego, pero funcionan lo suficientemente bien juntas para que la experiencia sea muy satisfactoria.\n\nA todo esto hay que a\u00f1adirle un buen doblaje (en ingl\u00e9s con subt\u00edtulos en castellano) y una banda sonora que cumple con creces.\n\nAl final, \"Stick It To The Man!\" termina siendo una experiencia satisfactoria en todos sus aspectos, graciosa, divertida, y con un aspecto visual tremendamente bueno. \u00a1Habr\u00eda que golpearse la cabeza muy fuerte para no verlo!", "timestamp_created": 1438181410, "timestamp_updated": 1438181410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514777", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17137069": {"recommendationid": "17137069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064861176", "num_games_owned": 929, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437380793}, "language": "english", "review": "A great and funny game.

There are also puzzles which revolve around reading people's minds and moving stickers to manipulate the world around you.  The puzzles are really easy, as long as you're careful when exploring the levels.\n\nThe story's pretty good.  You're a guy named Ray, who got hit on the head after returning from work.  When you wake up, you realize that you have a hand sticking out of your head.  This hand can be used to grab stickers, pins, and read other people's minds, all of which are used to solve puzzles.  The story is unique, the dialogue is quite funny, and the voice acting is pretty nice.\n\nIf I had to make one complaint, it\u2019s that the game is rather short.  It only lasted about 5 hours for me, and I even got all of the achievements.  What the game has is fine, but a little more wouldn\u2019t hurt.\n\nOverall, I would suggest picking this game up.

Few games venture into the realm of comedy, but Zoink jumps in head first with no reservations. Every line and character is progressively more absurd than the last, with each joke zipping by so fast you might miss it if you aren\u2019t paying attention but making it easy to enjoy the ride due to having little time to actually dissect what\u2019s going on.\n\nstick it to the man pic 1If you were to break it down I doubt Stick It To The Man would elicit much more than a chuckle, but it\u2019s how fully embedded it is in its ridiculous plot and satirical commentary that makes it all work. Every time I started the game it would take a moment to adjust to its outrageous style of humor, but a few minutes later I\u2019d be sticking stickers all over things they don\u2019t belong on and having an immensely good time watching the chaos unfold. Stick It To The Man is like a roller coaster that only goes up, with the stakes and quality of gags getting more and more insane the longer the game goes on even as you\u2019re waiting for it to all come falling apart.\n\nThat\u2019s not to imply Stick It To The Man is a particularly long game, clocking in around 3-4 hours, but it\u2019s so densely packed that I think that\u2019s all I could realistically take. It often felt like I\u2019d been playing longer than I actually had simply do to how much stuff was always happening and continuing to happen even while I was trying to comprehend the scene before. It\u2019s frankly a little exhausting to play, but in a way that makes you glad for its brevity because it ends right when you want it to.\n\nThere\u2019s undeniably a lot of Stick It To The Man that\u2019s little more than functional boredom, whether it\u2019s the dull and obtuse puzzle designs or the few aggravating times you come across an enemy and have to manage the clumsy platforming controls to avoid them. There are only a few instances of this sprinkled throughout the game yet each always longer and worse than the last time you came across one. These scenes might work on a technical level, but there\u2019s never any need for them to have been included.\n\nBut then everything circles around again to how delightfully written Stick It To The Man is even at its worst moments, and how that was more than enough to counteract its mechanical deficiencies for me. It\u2019s as stupid as it is clever and delivered with enough style to make even the most cringeworthy joke work. Even though I can\u2019t say I had a lot of fun playing Stick It To The Man, I was more than happy to spend some time reading the minds of its terrible, oh so entertaining hooligans.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NzuvA9nImg\n[b]You can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2015/04/13/stick-it-to-the-man-review/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1428945798, "timestamp_updated": 1428945798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705476", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15265747": {"recommendationid": "15265747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117600795", "num_games_owned": 638, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449148247}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Nossa muito bom , ate q inicio \u00e9 fraco mais depois quando entende como funciona fica muito legal  , eu adorei mesmo musica, historia grafico s\u00e3o divertido \n \nminha nota : 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1428508540, "timestamp_updated": 1428508540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538028", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15232915": {"recommendationid": "15232915", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997262840", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1407237229}, "language": "english", "review": "I had a lot of fun with this game.

Throughout the journey the player is treated to different set pieces and many colorful characters along the way. There's a lot of comedy in the game but like all comedy it may not appeal to certain demographics; I found a few chuckles in my playthrough but I could see some might not enjoy the jokes as much as me.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes the player basically has to grab stuff and stick it to other stuff in hopes of advancing the plot, and along the way one's treated to interesting thoughts they can read. It's mostly a simple platformer puzzler with relatively easy puzzles, so it's not the most challenging game in the world.

I enjoyed my time, but I can only recommend the game if you like a style and bizzare sense of humor (it's a pretty short game, you need 4-5 hours to finish it on your first playthorugh).\n\nI like a style and a humor, and first couple of levels are very-very fun. Cut-scenes are fun and the game doesn't show you the same cut-scene if you die. If you replay some level, press backspace for 5 seconds to skip.\n\nVoice acting is very good, and most of the dialogs are funny. And you can hold 'd' to speed up the speech if you are bored.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of things I didn't like: it can be a problem with my PC, but controls feel clunky to me. I spend a lot of time retrying jumps of moving platforms. And I am not a new person to the platformers genre. Controls aren't rebindable (at least from the menus). Sometimes you think you can make the jump, but the platform is a bit far away. This won't be a problem, but you have goons in this game.\n\nFirst two or three encounters with goons are good. However, after some time goons are not fun anymore. I just hoped it's the last goon on this level. Good thing you are not forced to do the same section more than once, developers provides you short cuts after you beat the section.\n\nAnd the last thing: I liked some quests, but a lot of them are illogical.

With the help of these stickers you solve all the \"puzzles\" in the game. I put puzzles in quotations because they're not real puzzles, there is basically no thinking involved, you just try sticking every sticker where it is possible and you solve it, that's all there is to it.\n\nSimilarly, there is no difficulty involved with the platforming in the game. And sadly the same goes for avoiding the enemies. They move in predictable patterns and it's easy to lose them even if you get spotted, that means that you're just going thorugh the motions most of the time.\n\nDespite all that the story, dialogue and art style are here to save the game. It's hard to do humour in video games and Stick it to The Man! manages just that quite often. I am not talking about laugh out loud moments, but I was most certainly entertained throughout the game, even if there is a bit too much of listening to oneliners when you're reading people's minds. Finally, the art style alone is worth checking out, it gives the illusion of everything being made from paper or carboard and it achieves a very nice effect which doesn't get old until  the end.\n\nI couldn't recommend the game based on the gameplay alone, however the style of the game is absolutely worth checking out.\n\n6\u00bd / 10", "timestamp_created": 1425499838, "timestamp_updated": 1425499838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14728366": {"recommendationid": "14728366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006822506", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427036092}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome graphics", "timestamp_created": 1425325339, "timestamp_updated": 1425325339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14633139": {"recommendationid": "14633139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097020288", "num_games_owned": 562, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424738415}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Stick it to The Man! \u00e9 um jogo indie que logo de cara nos mostra sua proposta: irrever\u00eancia e bom humor (que por algumas vezes chega a flertar o humor-negro).\nO jovem Ray, um cara comum e meio idiota, est\u00e1 tranquilamente vivendo sua rotina, quando uma acidente acontece, e ele leva uma pancada na cabe\u00e7a.

You'll solve puzzles by reading people's minds, and manipulating them into thinking about a certain item that you can use somewhere else on the chapter. It's certainly not a hard game, with it nicely structured levels, always subtly guiding your way, never proving frustrating.\n\nIt's been said to be \"Psychonauts\" spiritual successor. While I have not played Psychonauts, I've played other Double Fine games, and the influence is clear! While the game mechanics don't seem to take the spotlight, they're very well conceived, and fit very well with the game's theme and aesthetics. It was one of the more enjoyable games I've recently played!\n\n\n[b][u]Presentation[/u][/b]\nThis is probably the highlight in this game. Everything from the visuals, to the music and the voice acting is awesome!\nIt's a very colorful game, done in 2.5D. This is achieved by making every sprite like a cardboard cutout. The levels are then set in layers. While the game is mostly 2D, you can sometimes walk back and forth, discovering some charming details that would otherwise be blurred.\nThe character design is also great. While everyone looks silly, their designs clearly shows their personality, coupled with the problems you'll solve and the voice acting... It's good.\n\nThe [b]music[/b] is mostly jazz (it reminded me of the bebop soundtrack in Grim Fandango, maybe a bit silly at times) with a bit of sci-fi synth thrown in, at times. I really liked it, and it's certainly something that not only fit the game, but it's also something I'll listen to after I'm finished with the it! (You can get it here: http://stickittotheman.bandcamp.com/releases with a PayWhatYouWant model)\nThe [b]sound-effects[/b] Also fit well with the cartoony style. Never felt out of place, so that's good.\n\nThe [b]voice-acting[/b] was also great! Reinforcing the characters and the overall feel of the game, and was mostly well done! There were a few characters that felt a bit inconsistent, but nothing too major. Also, you can rewind and fastforward their speech, making the voices even sillier, with a higher tone, if you're in a hurry. It's these details that make this game so enjoyable, honestly!\n\nThe game's [b]writing[/b] is great as well! It's not anything deep, as you can imagine (although it does hint at some major issues, in a very lighthearted way), but it's certainly funny, if you're into this kind of humor.\n\n\n[b][u]General Structure[/u][/b]\nThe game's divided by chapters, each with its theme, set of characters and puzzles. You can always go back to previous chapters through the menu, so you don't need to worry about missing an objective and being blocked from going back. This is something I very much appreciate! I hate being blocked for apparently no reason. \nMost of the chapters also have some achievements. Most of them are just a guide to silly characters that were more well hidden. It's a good use of them, to be honest! There are a couple of them that were more skill-based, if you're into that. But the Stick it to the Man! is a very laid-back game, and it never really tests your skills or patience.\nEach level has lots of checkpoints, and you'll never lose any progress. The worst that can happen is you being sent a few meters back, but you never lose items or conversations.\n\nEach level is about 20-40 minutes long. It felt just the right length for me. I played each chapter in one sitting, sometimes 2, and it never felt too short or to drag on. Also, since the levels can be fairly long, walking back would be a pain. As such, they've implemented a sort of fast travel system. Once you reach a certain point, a pipe open up, and you can go back instantly (and go forward once again).\n\nIt's a very comfortable game to play, as weird as it sounds. It's never frustrating, you're unlikely to walk around back and forth pointlessly, it's not punishing... just a nice, funny experience, overall.\n\n[b][u]Mechanics[/u][/b]\nBasically, you're hit on the head, and an alien just happens to [i]casually[/i] get into your brain. When that happens, a giant floppy pink hand grows out of your head, which only you can see. Nah, of course you're not crazy! It's [i]alieeeens[/i]. \n\nAnyway. This giant hand gives you the ability of reading people's minds, and materialize their thoughts. As freeing as it sounds, it's a very \"linear\" game. They'll only think of things you need, of course.\nWhen you encounter a character, you'll learn about their problems, and then have to find the solution, somewhere. The game's is very similar to a point n' click. However, while the solution aren't too obvious, at first (since they're very non-sensical -- in a good way!), you can easily find everything by walking around and getting more items. If you have more than one, you'll store them, and can switch between them with the mouse-wheel.\nIf you stay put, your character will also say something about the item, leading you in a general direction. There are also very subtle environmental hints, so I doubt you'll get stuck.\n\nSo yeah. You'll walk around the level, speaking to the characters and reading their thoughts, often leading to some very peculiar situations, as you solve their problem in funny ways.\n\nAgain, it's not a game you'd play for the mechanics, but they're still very well put together! They fit with the theme, and even amplify it, never proving a nuisance, unlike other games in a similar style. It's very well designed!\n\n\nIt's pretty hard for me to get more to talk about. The game is very good, but it doesn't seem to do anything that jumps out at you. Everything just seems to fit together brilliantly, to me.\n\n[b][i]For an adventure game, the 2D platforming certainly helped, against the traditional Point n' Click style[/i][/b]\nUsually, games like this opt for the point n' click genre, rather than 2D platforming. As a result, their movement system is also very clunky and slow, going around the screens, taking seconds of waiting at a time. Stick it to the Man! avoids that entirely, by giving you total control at all times!\nIt makes the game incredibly better, in my eyes. It's not that I have anything against Pn'C games, but I usually find myself frustrated when I have to walk back and forth very slowly, simply to try a random combination of items.\nThis game, however, makes movement faster, and every scene seems to have [i]some[/i] little detail that makes the walking around even more enjoyable.\n\n[b][i]Lack of punishment[/i][/b]\nThere are games that benefit from being punishing and challenging. This is not one of them, and the developers recognized it very well. It's not that there isn't [i]any[/i] challenge. There certainly is (mostly by being chased around the guards -- which people didn't enjoy very much!), but even if you \"fail\", you don't lose progress, and the more challenging sections are short, just keeping things varied. \n\n[b][i]The puzzles keep moving you forward[/i][/b]\nLast point I want to make. You rarely have to backtrack to solve a puzzle, at least to the point of annoyance. You'll usually gather items as you go, and use them either very near the place, or further ahead. On the times you do have to go back, the solution are clear, and there's usually an easy game to get back. Again, the point of the game is to present you with a silly story and character interactions, and it does that very well!\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nI don't have anything else to say, honestly. I really, [i]really[/i] enjoyed the whole way through. It's on the short side, but it's certainly worth it. If you like Double Fine's games (the Stacking and Grim Fandango particularly coming to mind -- And Psychonauts for most people), give this one a go! I'm sure you won't be disappointed. \nEven if you don't... if the description sounds appealing, I still recommend it.

I actually listened it once in the menu before starting the game, it's so awesome (Just Dropped In by Kenny Rogers) The game is really promising - intresting paper world with lots of fourth wall breaking (Ray noticing about how absurd that he has to jump a lot to get to home during a tutorialish first level, checkpoints are photocopiers what prints you as respawning), really well-written and witty dialogues with puns, jokes, and don't forget about the great voice-acting!\nThe game itself is a little weird, it reminds me to some cartoons of the 90s in terms of graphics that's borderline bizarre and weird, but this also gives the game some uniqueness - speaking about being unique, don't forget the \"giant pink spaghetti hand\". \nSo far platforming mechanics are solid and controls of the character, including the arm are easy to get used to - the mindreading is a great idea, I'm really looking forward for some good laughs and creative problem-solving using this tool.\nI'm really looking forward to continue to play this game, but first I really need some sleep, I'll update the review probably after the completion the game and/or getting all achievements :)\n\nEDIT: Finally finished - 15.8 hours, with lots of afk/desktop running. I would say people are quite right when they say the game is ~ 5-6 hours long , but it really depends on you listening to every single person, or just skip it.\nThe game was fantastic, intresting and I'm especially happy that the story stayed just as solid at the end as it was at it's beginning. I've found quite a few instresting sentences, dialogues, pictures that made me laugh - I even got to save Santa! :)\nThe final level was outstandingly creative - don't want to spoil anyone's joy of exploration - I'll just say it can be hard with mothers  ;) \n\nStick It To The Man! was maybe the most unique game I've played in the past months, along with Jazzpunk.

I was introduced to Stick it to the Man after a friend showed me his copy on PS4, and after watching a few minutes of gameplay I knew right away that this was an adventure that I needed to track down.\n\nIn most aspects, Stick it to the Man is heavily influenced by Double Fine studios, and the art, humor, and platforming style invokes Psychonauts heavily throughout. There are actually a few easter eggs sprinkled in the game that reference Double Fine (such as a stuffed doll of Double Fine\u2019s double-headed logo), but it doesn\u2019t feel as if this title is stealing too much from the larger company. I very much enjoyed the concept of the game, living in a sort-of shadow box world with cardboard cutouts and interactive stickers, and the level design is varied and unique. Game difficulty isn\u2019t an issue, although I did encounter odd bugs once or twice which prevented me from making forward progress (namely, sticker mounting points would not immediately appear next to important characters or locations). Also, when several interaction points are clustered near each other, your controls can get squirrelly as the game attempts to snap to context-sensitive areas (and this happens quite frequently).\n\nThe story is nonsensical and lighthearted, which I found to be a refreshing change of pace with so many games recently sticking to dark and brooding or sardonic main characters. Ray, the protagonist, is very sweet and helpful to everyone he interacts with, including Ted, the goofy and forgetful alien taking residence in his brain.

You will feel a compulsive need to read EVERY mind you come across, even if it's unnecessary, and you probably should because there's an achievement for it. Ultimately, while having the game come to a stop every 30 seconds so you can read a new mind does indeed break good, natural gameplay flow into splintery pieces, I immediately forgive it.

Both in the humor and the fact that the focus of the story is around brains. That's not a problem. I like psychonauts. It doesn't really rip off any elements or steal any jokes from the game, either, so it ends up working really well. Ray does sound quite a lot like Rasputin though. Which is fine.\nThe main gameplay is jumping around platforms, grabbing stuff with your magic spaghetti hand, solving puzzles, and avoiding enemies. There's not a whole lot of depth to it and the game ends up being rather short, but it doesn't ever feel repetitive either. The stealth segments are probably the weakest, since most of the time there's no reason to not just brute-force your way through them. The puzzles aren't too difficult as usually you're told exactly what you need and where, which is good since they'd be very adventure game-y puzzles otherwise. The weirdness of the scenarios actually adds to the variety and it's amusing to see just what the game decides to do next. The game also looks great and sounds great, the paper aesthetic is played with quite nicely and the music is pretty fitting for the tone and style.

Not that that last part matters all that much, but it gives you an idea of how interesting even the side content of this game can be. \n\nThat being said, even disregarding what my playtime says, the game is pretty short in length (probably around 6-8 hours, I'd say, less if you don't read everything's mind) and while some of the enemy evasion sections feel a little on the strict side in terms of getting them just right to get past the guards, the rest of the game is very enjoyable. Especially so if you're not sure what to make of the game and pick it up on a sale. Many of the puzzles are amusing and creative in their own right, often pulling themselves together through the pleasantly bizarre mechanic that the game hinges on, peeling the thoughts from other characters and inexplicably making them real, or peeling parts/items from other characters or the environment for use elsewhere. \n\nThere are some moments where you may find yourself wondering where to use some of the gathered items, the stickers as they call them (hence the game's name), but generally it becomes a rather straightforward affair of picking up what you can and figuring out what remains available to interact with to progress.

This, combined with the world aesthetic can lead to some pretty extraordinary and hilarious situations. And when I say hilarious, I mean times I genuinely laughed at the clever dialogue and puzzles before me. I even went through and tried to find all the funny dialogue I could, which is quite the achievement.\n\nThe aesthetic for the game is a world made of paper, string to hold things in place, and stickers. With your giant purple hand, you can remove and place stickers in different situations to solve puzzles. For example, if you place a horse head next to a singer, she'll think she's being attacked by the mob, and scream, at which point you can take her screaming mouth and use it somewhere else. It's very creative, fresh, and compelling.\n\nThe story and characters were very likable, especially Ray. He wasn't a perfect person, but he made a perfect protagonist. Paired with lovely voice acting, it was truly something special.\n\nIf I had one problem with it, I would say that there were too many chase areas in the levels. While you could create a checkpoint after clearing it once, there were too few ways to solve them for the number of times it was iterated, and often was unreliable at times when trying to grab thoughts and hitting pins instead, resulting in a quick death.\n\nAll in all, this game was a nice experience.

Point and Click was hard to do on a counsel because you will, point and click.  There have been attempts to revive the genre, but not much has happened with it except for re- releases and re-makes. Until now, \n\nStick it to the man is a game that advertises as an action platformer, but its really a point and click game in disguise, it also a game very much about comedy.  Here Let me give you a basic plot description, The Main Character Has Psychic powers, can read peoples minds to help solve their problems, its has a unique artstyle and sense of humor. There is also platforming and puzzle solving.\n\nNow if you know anything about good games your mind should instantly think of Psychonauts, and if you don\u2019t know Psychonauts, 1st you should, and second go watch the Zero punctuation review on it or something, but if you\u2019re to even do that then ill explain, Psychonauts, is an action platformer, puzzle solver, with unique art style and sense of humor, The main character also can read minds.\n\nSo now that i\u2019ve gotten that comparison out of the way, I\u2019ll talk more about this game, The art style of the game is a mixture between the weirdness of psychonauts, and the Cardboard of tearaway. The game also has a depth to it, you can move up and down the foreground, and background like in little big planet, but  the game never uses this to its advantage, i can only remember using it one time and that was when i discover i could even do it.\n\nThe Music in the game is repetitive unfortunately, every time you run into an enemy it plays the same music until you\u2019ve successfully escaped, its always the same no variation of bad guy music.\n\nThe Gameplay of the game is centered around one central gimmick, your mind arm, Your mind arm is somthing you get in the very beginning of the game, and its what makes this game. It is your  cursor, its what you use to interact with the world, It's what lets you read minds to solve problems, it helps you platform acting like a grappling hook. Its what manages your inventory, and tears off stickers. \n\nSticker by the way are exactly what they sound like they are parts of the world that have been highlighted that you can rip off and stick to other things using your mind arm. You can get stickers by finding highlighted things in the world, or by reading someone's mind see what they are thinking of the literally ripping the thought out of their mind as a sticker. Stickers are the items used to solve the puzzles the game presents you with and you can have more than one at a time, this is where the inventory comes in. The inventory is just the d-pad left and right on the controller, it keeps it simple and easy. \n\nThe Control of the mind arm is\u2026 not so great. It you use the right analog stick to aim the arm, then it has an auto lock on to objects, the auto lock works but its also a problem. When there is more than one character next to another (which happens a lot by the way) it becomes hard to lock on to who you want to read  the mind of sometimes only allowing certain angles. The platforming is also floaty, it just doesn't feel super responsive, some of that may be attributed to the artstyle, but at some points especially when around enemies, you just don't feel like you have the amount of control you should.\n\nFloaty Controls aside, its the story and style that makes a point and click game, and boy does it have it in spades. This game is funny, thats hard to find in games now a days, you either have absurd humor, like goat simulator, or good character dialog like in borderlands. This game does both surprisingly well. \n\nIll give you an example of one of the puzzles, in one portion of the game you are tasked with escaping an insane asylum on and island. You meet tons of crazy characters each with different personalities and goals, You meet a captain who says he\u2019s slain a great whale, you eventually find this whale decomposing, you also meet a taxidermist in the asylum, you bring her to the what and she sows it up, you then meet a man who is hyperventilating into a bag, you take this mans you take this man to the whale and he blows into the bowl hole filling it with air, you now have a raft made out of a dead whale that you use to escape the island. \nIf dead whale raft isn't funny to you, then something's wrong with you, or your an animal rights activist who doesn't like video games. The entire game is filled with over the top moments like that.\n\nThis does bring up some points negative though, almost all point and clicks suffer from this, and that is convoluted puzzles, you know when you just don't know what to do so you have to try everything with everything else, yah that moment. Fortunately it doesn't happen that often but when it happens it really slow the games pace down. \n\nThe game also has a lot of backtracking, like most point and clicks . Most of the game takes place on large maps that you have to fully explore to solve the puzzles, and get to the next area, but the backtracking isn't that bad and there are some parts in the game that will let you do a quick travel to certain areas.\n\nAlthough this game definitely suffers from all the problems that have always plagued Point and clicks, it works well and is definitely the benchmark for a counsel point and click game, so if soul successor to Psychonauts sounds good to you, dont hesitate to buy. \n", "timestamp_created": 1410148838, "timestamp_updated": 1410148838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12017338": {"recommendationid": "12017338", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992224405", "num_games_owned": 8212, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1408496348}, "language": "english", "review": "The voice acting and animation are very good.

Well, perhaps not everything.\n\nThe game opens with Ray, the player character, whose job is testing hard-hats. The symbolism behind Ray\u2019s career is soon apparent when an accident occurs that leaves him with severe head trauma. The moral? Wear a hard-hat on construction sites, literally. While not offering a great deal of difficulty with its platform-style mechanics, Stick It presents gamers with something refreshingly unique in a video game \u2013 a comedic look at the tragic effect of a decadent society on the mental health of its members. Ray\u2019s ability to read minds and the obstacles that follow as the result of the accident become a constant, subconscious reminder to always keep your head, i.e. mental health, protected.\n\nWhen Ray wakes up, he a notices that there is a neon-pink arm sticking out of his head. This chimerical arm is your best friend. The arm gives Ray the ability to read minds and navigate the game space. It also serves to help Ray rip stickers (in traditional puzzle solvers these would be the \u201citems\u201d in your inventory) out of the game world as well as NPC minds, and stick them in different places to solve puzzles. Ray, however, finds the protuberance alarming and sets off to find a way to get rid of it. As no one else can see it but himself, Ray\u2019s first plan is to head to a psychiatrist who, we soon see, needs more help than he does. \n\nThe game is divided into ten chapters in which Ray is faced with several obstacles to moving on to the next stage. Ray gets around these hindrances by helping other characters with their troubles \u2013 and a colourful cast of oddballs it is who require Ray\u2019s help. From a suicidal taxi driver who wants a new set of teeth to a woman with an abandonment complex who prefers her pets taxidermied, Stick It leaves no allusions to obsessive compulsions or mental ailments untouched. The game does not stop there. The social stigma that accompanies those with mental disorders is also represented by a cast of mental institution staff and law enforcement officials who are constantly chasing Ray and locking up those who are deemed unfit.\n\nStick It does not suggest slapping stickers on, what are serious problems in real life, as a solution. That would be all too easy. What Stick It does do, is create a turbulent backdrop of a modern city with the imaginative use of art and colour in order to present, and make you think about, a tragic social problem. More importantly, it does so in a game that is packaged with distinct style, charming characters, comedic dialogue and a genuine, if na\u00efve, notion that love will conquer all. \n\nI say play it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1409132471, "timestamp_updated": 1409132471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11880600": {"recommendationid": "11880600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064271724", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480048553}, "language": "english", "review": "Lot's of fun, and guinlly entertaining with a creative Paper Mario-esk art style.

The jokes were close by, each of them funny and punchy. The music was fun - most of it wasn't memorable at all, yet it fit perfectly, but the title song was magic. The art was unique, original, fun, and throughout the game world are little background and foreground jokes that add a bit of spice to an already fantastic looking game. Characters were lively, silly, voiced EXCELLENTLY, their inner thoughts giving way to some very good jokes - it's little homages to gaming were tasty icing to naturally good comedy - that actually handle scat humour with real wit. You learned to love our little protagonist and his head... thing. While the puzzles were strange, they made sense, and the wonderful thing about this game that they were solved simply by curiously peeking into peoples thoughts everywhere you went, and you wouldn't play this game if you didn't want to do that. And, like many other people, the game is actually fun for the brief sections where you run from the guards. Those parts get harder with a proper curve, and are fun, and briefly exhilirating. It was a nice way to counter balance the slow puzzling. And the length? It had a story to tell, and it told it quickly. This kind of game was more like a movie than anything else, and the running gag can only last so long. So, by not making looong pointless areas, they condensed everything to a perfectly proportioned pie of funny and pictures and visual stimuli, with a quick, fun story. I wouldn't want it longer, because everything they did felt good. I didn't feel like I wanted more - was satisfied, and laughing. And that, with good voice acting, art style, jokes, pacing, gameplay, game mechanincs, characters, music, and identity, is really, all you can ask for, isn't it?

It's a puzzle platformer that's more of a point-and-click, but neither of those facets of the game aren't super successful.\n\nThe main mechanics of Stick it to the Man! are reading people's minds to gather information and manipulating the world by peeling off stickers and placing them on other things to solve problems, all while avoiding government agents out to get you. \n\nThe mind reading part is tedious. The voice acting is great, but some characters speak very slowly and by the time you finish reading the subtitiles, the character is only halfway through his or her speech. Dialogue cannot be skipped in pieces or scrolled through, only sped up or skipped entirely. \n\nThe puzzles themselves aren't anything special. One of the recurring \"puzzles\" (if you may call it that) is escaping the agents trying to get you. I didn't enjoy any of these segments. I'm assuming the game expects you to cleverly sneak around the enemies, placing stickers on them to make them fall asleep or distract them. However, this is usually impossible to do as you can't see all the agents on the screen at once and you have only a few seconds before they notice you and start chasing you around. It's much easier to just run to the other side than trying to spend time sticking stickers on people and getting caught.\n\nStick it to the Man's strongest element is its art style.

Well, as I prefaced, this game is a difficult one to pinpoint in my brain, but the one withstanding element throughout the whole thing was this constant reminder of the humor and stylization that DoubleFine creates in their game Psychonauts.\n\nWhile the story is somewhat lackluster for me in Stick it to the Man, it easily is made up for the sheer volume of interesting character background and stories therein. This game allows the player to enter the mind of most any biological being, dead or alive, and therein the game shines!\n\nThere's rich little mini-stories that are perfectly done, and I almost believe that the writers knew about their main story as being straight-forward, so they decided to sprinkle the whole thing with entertaining sub-plots throughout, making an entertaining ride.

Y si esos g\u00e9neros son las plataformas y la aventura gr\u00e1fica, las posibilidades de que fracase aumentan. Pero cuando este mezcla se hace bien, y se adereza con grandes dosis de humor absurdo, el resultado puede ser un t\u00edtulo de lo m\u00e1s interesante, como Stick it to the Man.\n\n\nAN\u00c1LISIS STICK IT TO THE MAN\n\nJugabilidad\n\nEste es, sin lugar a dudas, el apartado en el que m\u00e1s destaca el juego. Nada m\u00e1s tomar el control del protagonista, nos encontraremos con un juego de plataformas con acci\u00f3n lateral, en el que tendremos que ir superando una serie de obst\u00e1culos para llegar hasta nuestro objetivo. Pero al poco de haber empezado a jugar se a\u00f1adir\u00e1 un nuevo elemento que har\u00e1 que la jugabilidad cobre un nuevo significado, acercandose a las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas de Point and Click: nos saldr\u00e1 un brazo-espagueti rosa de la cabeza.\n\nEsta extremidad adicional, nos permitir\u00e1 tanto desplazarnos por algunos puntos del escenario como leer las mentes de los personajes del entorno, que puede desembocar en comentarios hilarantes (en especial las menciones a Descartes), o darnos pistas de que hacer para continuar. Adem\u00e1s de esto, tambi\u00e9n lo podremos utilizar para recoger \u201cpegatinas\u201d que tendremos que colocar en el lugar adecuado para superar los diversos de forma bastante original.\nGr\u00e1ficos\n\nLa expresi\u00f3n que mejor puede definir el apartado gr\u00e1fico de este t\u00edtulo es \u201ccaricatursco\u201c. De principio a fin, no podremos m\u00e1s que poner cara de sorpresa ante los gr\u00e1ficos de este t\u00edtulo. Todo, desde personajes a objetos y paisajes, est\u00e1n hechos de papel y cart\u00f3n. Esto hace que las dos dimensiones salgan de la jugabilidad para introducirse en los propios personajes.\n\n\nAdem\u00e1s, con un sentido del humor \u00fanico que caracteriza este t\u00edtulo, los personajes har\u00e1n diversos comentarios a este respecto (como por ejemplo los problemas de manejar un avi\u00f3n de cart\u00f3n bajo una gran tormenta). Por si esto no fuera suficiente para hacernos re\u00edr, los \u201ccheckpoints\u201c, que nos permitir\u00e1n reaparecer si morimos, son impresoras que recompondr\u00e1n al protagonista sobre una hoja de papel.\n\nSonido\n\nQuiz\u00e1s este sea el apartado m\u00e1s flojo del juego. El doblaje (solo disponible en ingl\u00e9s) cumple su papel sobradamente, pero cuando llevamos varias horas seguidas, empieza a hacerse un poco repetitivo el marcado \u201cacento paleto\u201d que tratan de imprimir en casi todos los personajes.\n\nEn cuanto al hilo musical, tambi\u00e9n cumple bastante bien con su cometido, con una variedad de estilos que se adapta a cada situaci\u00f3n, pero la mayor\u00eda de ellos gira en torno al blues o el jazz.\nHistoria\n\nYa hemos hablado varias veces del sentido del humor tan absurdo con el que cuenta este t\u00edtulo, y que hace que el juego tenga uno de los guiones m\u00e1s surrealistas y divertidos que hemos visto en los \u00faltimos tiempos.\n\n\nEl protagonista es Ray Doewood, un joven que no tiene muy claro que hacer en la vida. Por ello decide entrar a trabajar como \u201cprobador de cascos\u201d. Su vida ser\u00e1 m\u00e1s o menos t\u00edpica (dentro de lo que puede ser t\u00edpico en este alocado universo) hasta que un accidente de avi\u00f3n har\u00e1 que un alien se infiltre en su cerebro, d\u00e1ndole poder ps\u00edquicos. A partir de ese momento, intentar\u00e1 descubrir de donde vienen esos poderes, a la par que trata de escapar de unos hombres misteriosos que quieren capturarle.\nConclusi\u00f3n\n\nEn definitiva, Stick it to the Man es un juego divertido, ideal para pasar un rato rasc\u00e1ndote el cerebro (imagina hacerlo con un brazo-espagueti rosa) mientras te r\u00edes a carcajada limpia con un humor realmente absurdo. El gran inconveniente es su escasa duraci\u00f3n, que no permite llegar a disfrutar al 100% de toda la originalidad que derrocha el t\u00edtulo.", "timestamp_created": 1398369892, "timestamp_updated": 1398369892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499176", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9886192": {"recommendationid": "9886192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097705127", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1402020283}, "language": "english", "review": "Stick It To The Man has quickly cemented itself as my absolutely favorite video game of all time ever since I played it a year ago on the Vita.

That was one of the games I grew up on.  I also recall Earthworm Jim on the Sega Genesis as well (one of the games available on Sega Channel).  I bought this game because it looked to be about as silly as both of those games.  And it was.  Contrary to what the negative reviews say, I found myself laughing out loud at some of the jokes.  As for the title song, it fell flat for me when I listened to it on it's own; however, as a theme/title screen song for the game it fits in well.  The music for the rest of the game (during the levels) was far better though.  Overall the experience was enjoyable.  \n\nThe puzzle solving in this game is unique.  It definitely wasn't what I was expecting, but it was by no means unwelcome.  However, there are a few levels that, taken as a whole, could have been reworked.  These are the levels where there are little to no puzzles.  It wasn't disappointing to me because they fit well with the storyline.  I also make it a point to go into a new game with minimal expectations, but if I was expecting lots of puzzles those levels might disappoint me overall.  The main drawback for me is short term replayability.  I'm expecting to finish out the Steam Achievements in maybe another playthrough or two.  I got nearly half of them already and I'm on the final chapter during my first playthrough.\n\nOnce I'm done with the Steam Achievements, I probably won't play this game again in the near future.

Du point de vue du gameplay c'est assez g\u00e9nial, les mouvements sont fluides, et le pouvoir de Ray permet de d\u00e9coller des morceaux entier de d\u00e9cor pour r\u00e9v\u00e9ler des \u00e9l\u00e9ments cach\u00e9s! Le jeu est d\u00e9coup\u00e9 en chapitres, l'humour est absolument g\u00e9nial et omnipr\u00e9sent, et on ne se lasse pas de lire dans l'esprit des gens tellement c'est dr\u00f4le!\n\nle jeu est en VO et les voix sont vraiment trop marrantes, le jeu a une option pour mettre les sous titres fran\u00e7ais, et m\u00eame s'il y a quelques petites erreurs, le travail est bien fait, et pourtant ce n'est pas simple de retranscrire la totalit\u00e9 des blagues de la VO!\n\nLes \u00e9nigmes sont d'une bonne difficult\u00e9 parfois, mais il n'y a rien d'insurmontable, on est jamais bloqu\u00e9 pour ainsi dire.\n\nUn des tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s gros point fort du jeu, c'est sa bande originale bien jazzy, qui est absolument excellente!\n\nJ'ai pass\u00e9 6 heures a rigoler, vraiment! C'est exactement le type d'univers que j'adore, tous les personnages sont g\u00e9niaux, il y a un vrai rythme, ce qui pourtant est souvent le grand d\u00e9faut des Point & Click.\n\nAu niveau des succ\u00e8s, ils faut explorer tout le jeu, mais c'est un r\u00e9flexe pour les vrais fans de Point & Click me direz vous!\n\nJe le recommande vivement!

Stick it to the Man is the latest game to try and add a bit more adventure to our lives and does so with some platform elements, a bunch of stickers and a strange alien spaghetti hand.\n\nThe somewhat crazy story follows the character of safety helmet tester Ray. One day on his way home a strange canister drops out of the sky and hits him on the head. The canister contains a strange little alien named Ted (Who looks a bit like a cute Krang from the Turtles cartoon). Ted hides inside Ray\u2019s brain and grants him the power to read people\u2019s minds via a giant alien spaghetti arm he now has growing out of his head.\n\nIt sounds odd and it is, invoking more than a few memories of Psychonaughts in terms of style and tone. Ray must use his new powers to escape the people who are hunting him and find out what has happened to his girlfriend. This is done via a combination of light platforming sections and using the hand to read people\u2019s minds, find out what they want and then slapping the appropriate sticker into their thought bubble.\n\nThe graphical style of the game represents the world in a pop-up book style. Characters are paper thin and everything comes across like a twisted comic book. It\u2019s a style that works really well and it helps to add charm and humour to the already excellent script and characters. Stripping the outside of buildings off like paper to reveal what\u2019s going on inside in a particularly nice touch.\n\nThe game is 2D and has Ray move around a set map. Around the map are agents looking to capture him and this is where the platforming comes in. You can use Ray\u2019s alien hand to grab hold of drawing pins and pull him to different places. Using this ability and a combination of stickers that make agents fall asleep or become confused, you have to make your way undetected past the goons to the next area. Being caught results in restarting from a nearby checkpoint so though the controls can be a little bit loose it never caused us any frustration.\n\nThe puzzles for the most part are fairly logical (at least within the logic of the world), and we never came across anything that had us stumped or frustrated for a massive amount of time. The only slightly odd puzzles that are likely to stop you dead are when you need to get people to follow you. One in the mental asylum springs to mind where a character repeatedly said that an object would be perfect for her cat but actually needed to be led somewhere else.\n\nPuzzles generally involve reading a characters mind which creates a thought bubble. From here it\u2019s all about grabbing stickers from people\u2019s thoughts and taking them to the appropriate place to use them. This is what you\u2019ll be doing for the bulk of your time and it\u2019s a testament to the design that it doesn\u2019t feel like one giant fetch quest (which effectively all point and click adventures are). \n\nStick it to the Man isn\u2019t massively long but it offers up an inventive and fun adventure that you can\u2019t help but like. It came as a nice surprise as we hadn\u2019t really heard much about the game before. What we have here is a combination of a good script and some fun play mechanics which create a fairly unique title. If you\u2019re looking for something a little different or want to test out your puzzle solving skills then this could be the game for you.\n\nOverall 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1391543553, "timestamp_updated": 1391543553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8944334": {"recommendationid": "8944334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055889735", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1391728789}, "language": "english", "review": "Very quirky and cleaverly written game!

Y es que Zoink! quiso dar su salto a la PC y consolas (se dedicaban exclusivamente a juegos para iOS y Android) tirando todo por la ventana con este juego, cuya premisa plantea un joven con un fideo rosa que le sale de la cabeza. \nEn Stick It To The Man -un medio camino entre ser un juego point and click y un plataformero - la estrella es su historia tan descabellada como graciosa: Ray Doewood se gana la vida como un aburrido tester de sombreros cuando una noche de tormenta volviendo a su casa, un paquete misterioso cae de un avi\u00f3n militar y lo golpea en la cabeza. Al despertar se encuentra con un fideo rosa sali\u00e9ndole del cerebro, que no solo le permite colgarse de ganchos sino que ahora tambi\u00e9n puede leer la mente de todos los que lo rodean. Nada contento con lo sucedido The Man, l\u00edder de la operaci\u00f3n, env\u00eda a sus s\u00fabditos para atrapar a Ray y extirparle su nuevo par\u00e1sito.\n\nTanto gr\u00e1ficamente como por su historia y humor el juego se siente como si hubiese salido de las manos del mism\u00edsimo Tim Schaffer. De hecho tuve que chequear nuevamente quienes eran los creadores del juego una vez que empec\u00e9 a jugarlo.\n\nEl arte es muy interesante; si bien se trata de escenarios que representan edificios y objetos de cart\u00f3n y papel, logra ser muy oscuro y turbio en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n. Cada cap\u00edtulo nos ofrece un mapa bastante extenso y diferente al anterior. Contando con m\u00e1s de 100 personajes, cada uno  con un pensamiento y arte \u00fanico a excepci\u00f3n de los guardias, que son exactamente iguales.\n\nSi bien se define como un juego de plataformas,  en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n se sienten como una mera excusa para que el juego dure un poco m\u00e1s. Los movimientos del personaje son muy simples y s\u00f3lo plantean un cierto desaf\u00edo al momento de escapar de los guardias. En estas instancias el juego incentiva a leerle la mente a los guardias y obtener as\u00ed, stickers que nos permitan dormirlos o hacer que persigan a otros guardias. Pese a que el juego aumenta su dificultad no basta para que estos encuentros sean desafiantes y se convierten en bastante aburridos, por lo que es m\u00e1s recomendado simplemente valerse de nuestros movimientos y los ganchos estrat\u00e9gicamente colocados para escapar. \n\nToda la idea de plataformas se considera un agregado m\u00e1s para Stick It To The Man pero tambi\u00e9n podr\u00eda haber funcionado si s\u00f3lo se tratase de un point and click. Entre los personajes podemos encontrar un general embarazado, una yeti con el coraz\u00f3n roto o una enfermera enamorada de un zombie, todos con sus di\u00e1logos y pensamientos \u00fanicos que sorprenden por el humor bizarro e il\u00f3gico. Los puzzles consisten en conseguir stickers  gracias a los pensamientos de quien nos crucemos y en general el juego se resuelve en forma de domin\u00f3: una vez que consigamos el primer sticker, podremos conseguir el siguiente, y el siguiente, y as\u00ed hasta terminar el cap\u00edtulo. No siempre es claro cu\u00e1l es el final del cap\u00edtulo por lo que es probable que lo terminemos sin haber usado todos nuestros stickers. De todas maneras, el juego permite rejugar todos los cap\u00edtulos pero desde cero, lo cual es bastante tedioso si tenemos que volver a escuchar todos los di\u00e1logos y pensamientos (a pesar de que se puedan adelantar).\n\nOtra de las grandes joyitas de Stick It To The Man radica en su gran banda de sonido. Es casi imposible empezar a jugarlo sin quedarse escuchando la canci\u00f3n del men\u00fa. Adem\u00e1s, el juego permite avanzar y retroceder la velocidad en la mayor\u00eda de di\u00e1logos del juego y la canci\u00f3n no es la excepci\u00f3n. Desgraciadamente esto tambi\u00e9n constituye uno de los bugs del juego ya que si se juega con el gamepad, el m\u00ednimo movimiento del stick cambia la velocidad del di\u00e1logo.\n\nSi buscamos plataformas desafiantes puede que Stick It To The Man no sea la mejor opci\u00f3n pero gracias a di\u00e1logos brillantes, variedad en los personajes y un arte innovador  logra sorprender y asegurar diversi\u00f3n por unas buenas 6 horas.\n\nhttp://www.aspeb.com.ar/main/index.php/bafici-gamer/79-bafici-gamer/10309-analisis-stick-it-to-the-man", "timestamp_created": 1391191000, "timestamp_updated": 1391191030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506112", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8871410": {"recommendationid": "8871410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108034705", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472238091}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun game that's full of cheesy, quirky jokes.

I enjoyed the strangeness of it all and found myself giggling many times. ;P  I'd love to explain the premise, but I wouldn't know how to do so since it is so (pleasantly) bizzare!  In summary.. you have many abilities; one of which is to read people's minds. Your main goal, thanks to being able to read their minds, is to help those in need with an 'extra' arm/hand that grew out of your head (weird, I know~!).  In order to help them resolve their issues, you have to swing around on different platforms with that extra arm; pick objects up, and subsequently stick those new objects onto other places or onto people to solve puzzles.

ONE ON ITS KIND!.\nThis is a very rare game, indeed, but not a boring rare game (as VOID or alike), just a full of originality and humor game that it's playable and delivers tons of fun.\n\nPut in a coctel shaker a tad of Grim Fandango, a tad of Jim Earth Worm, a tad of Toejam and Earl, a tad of South Park, a tad of LSD, shake it all with attitude and you get this game.\n\nAt a first glance, graphics can seem kiddy and un-exciting but, has South Park bad graphics and story or, they are just different and you end loving them?.

All scenarios and characters are carefully designed and, the overall ambientation is really well made.\n\nEasy at the beginning, goes harder step by step.\nThere are some crazy puzzles, well, sort of!. You usually have to get something to continue the story but, to get that you need to solve a chain of little puzzles in a row first, with no other clues than what your brain-readings say to you  but, not that hard. I was stuck just a couple of times.\n\nA drop of platform, a drop of adventure, a drop of puzzle-solving, a drop  of humor, a drop of everything fills a cup of fun and originality.\nWhile there are some rare games that come with some original idea, some doesn't work and are really boring as VOID or alike and, some are really exciting, as PAPO AND ME or just this one.\nGiving the bunch of originality and humor, you can find it short.\nI think the overall sensation is to be starring some cartoon film, ala South Park. Really funny.\n\nJust a warning: BE SURE TO HAVE AN XBOX CONTROLLER ON HAND.

The graphics reminded me of Psychonauts, another great game. That's also where the comparison (mostly) stops. Because this game is charming, fun and original, and it manages to do all that all on its own, without the need to copy from other popular games. \n\nYou play as Ray and early on in the story you manage to get an arm sticking out of your head. Not just an arm, it's actually an alien that makes use of your body. With this arm you can read the minds of other people to get hints on what to do next, but some of the people will also be reminded or think of certain events and that way items can be created.\n\nThe game plays like a platformer, but the gameplay itself is similar to that of a point-and-click adventure. Minus the frustrating, boring puzzles those games usually have.\n\nThe voices are done very well, with plenty of variety as far as characters go.\n\nIt's just a shame that this game is so short. A playthrough will last around 4 hours, which is enough, but it's not enough for a wonderful game like this. I enjoyed it all the way through and never got frustrated. That's partly the reason why I hoped it would last longer. Maybe for a possible sequel (the game does hint at one after all). \n\nA game like this should be a critical and financial success. It truly deserves to be. But I seriously doubt that will happen...\n\nAnyway, let's wrap this up.

You play as a dude who has an alien in his brain, which gives him mind reading powers and, since the alien is basically a stretchy arm, the ability to jump between platforms and grab things like stickers. \n\nThere is a lot of dialog, which might not be unusual for an adventure game, but I feel like I'm never really playing the game. I was unexpectedly shuffled out of a level without being able to finish all of the tasks, because there was no indication to which tasks were the important ones. The game is full of strangers in the city that you have to help, as you run from some bad guys trying to catch you because of the alien attached to your brain. \n\nTo find out what each stranger needs, you have to read their minds with the sticky arm, which is a really cool, unique feature. But like I said, it slows down the game play so much and a lot of the tasks feel really pointless. The graphics are awesome as well, and I love the paper world feel. But the platforms are easy to jump between, or just frustrating when you've got identical bad guys chasing you so that rather than enjoy the new area you just discovered, you have to instead rush through it to get away. \n\nI really want to love this game, but it's almost impossible. Also, the adventure puzzles are really easy to solve. Once you read everyone's minds, it's really easy to see that you just visit a bunch of places in order and grab the stickers from them and put them elsewhere. \n\nAnd this one is really just my opinion, but the characters are so overly dramatic and cliche that I find it grating. I realize they're probably like this on purpose, but for a game with more adult themes it's weird how cartoonish and childish the cast is. \n\nIf you really want to experience this game, maybe wait for it to go on sale.

It's pretty much a must buy, especially at this price. It's about a 4-5 hour game that will continuously make you smile. Where some of the frustration coming from the gameplay is mediated immediately by the hilarious characters and overall lighthearted feel of the game. It's like playing a comedy act, in a sense. It has an amazing artstyle, unique and very pretty. \"So much art... such beauty\" to paraphrase a certain seagull. The printscreens really doesn't do the game justice.\n\nThe gameplay consists of a mixture between platforming, point and click and stealth. It's fine, nothing incredible, but it does it's job. It isn't too hard to progress. It does suffer from having the game be in the way of everything else, where you just want to get past these annoying stealth sessions to get to the good/fun part. The writing and voice acting shined a lot brighter than the gameplay did. This made the mood go down a bit when if you're a complete fuck-up you will be stuck at a few points for a while, but as said before, the game will make it up to you with it's intelligent writing, more or less hilarious humor, artstyle, new and intriguing situations. \n\nBuy this game, now, please. Go do it. It's the most I've laughed in a game since Psychonauts and it's really something everyone should play. It's a game with personality, a personality you will like, and that's sort of rare.

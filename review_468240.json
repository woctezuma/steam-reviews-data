The game (or simulator if you prefer) is beautiful. The visuals are great and the mechanics are what you would expect. I have only one issue with the current implementation of controls, they aren't Windows Mixed Reality Friendly.\n\nFor the Rift or Vive they probably work better. Both of these devices require you to set up sensors around the room which are used to locate the HMD and the controllers. However, for the WMR headsets, they use inside-out technology which does not require installing any external sensors in the room. This also means that any activity behind you is not available to interact with unless you are looking at it. This is the only game, so far, that I have played that requires you to look at the front of the ship while interacting with an object behind you. Since the WMR tracking system can only see 140 degrees from the front, if I try to steer the boat while looking forwards, the game will not recognize that I'm holding the steering.\n\nI would suggest to fix this one of two things. First, if the tracking system loses a controller (I look at the steering, grab it, and move it, then look back in front of me) it should keep me moving in the same direction of the last tracking position as long as I am still holding the trigger. In this state, if I let go of the trigger, the boat should auto-center steering. This would be the best option in my oppinion for Windows Mixed Reality devices.\n\nSecond option would be to have a \"virtual\" steering control in the front of the boat that will manipulate steering controls as if I was doing it from the rear. That way both controllers are in front of me and in view of the inside-out tracking system. This will lose some realism at the expense of better control.\n\nOtherwise the game is worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1514467586, "timestamp_updated": 1514467586, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38165832": {"recommendationid": "38165832", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982987444", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514976299}, "language": "english", "review": "Im a complete sailing novice and really enjoying this game.

I'd say it is worth the asking price, if you want it. They will probably continue to add updates until they get bored. It's the best sailing simulator, ok folks? The best. Believe me.

This game is a sailing simulator and in general a relaxing VR experience. Features of the game include learning about the different parts of the boat, learning about wind and sails, and then of course actually sailing the boat in races or just free-sail relaxation modes. There is also an experimentation mode allowing you to sail on turbulent ocean waters and another mode that lets you walk around the surface of a galleon. It is still in Early Access right now so I feels to me like the game is still finding its identity.\n\nIn terms of simulation, the game is actually not that deep. I expected to be intimidated because I had no sailing experience but really the only thing to get used to is understanding the concept of wind in the sail, and there is a tutorial lesson to help you through that. Once you have that concept, the controls are as simple as turning a rudder and pulling on a rope to manipulate the sail. The only small annoyance was on the larger ship with the steering wheel, the hitboxes can be a little shaky when you are trying to grab the wheel and I found myself clicking around a few times before I could grab the wheel. Other than that, everything is straight forward. There is locomotion in the game for walking around the bigger boats in the form of teleportation, which works perfect for this game.\n\nMaps range in times of day, including night sailing. By far my favorite map was actually the experimental ocean. The possibility to change the water turbulence is so much fun and it was very atmospheric to see huge waves come crashing down on your boat. The immersion for this mode is really fantastic. Understandably in terms of a simulation it's probably not very typical to sail a tiny boat on the ocean, but I would still love to see more stuff like this mode. As of now, there is only a limited amount of boats to sail: A small sailboat that is operated by steering the rudder, and larger yacht with a deck and steering wheel.\n\nThe graphics are overall good but weaker in some specific areas. The water is great and the rolls of the current with the light diffraction is all excellent. The weaker aspect is in the textures of some models. The boat textures are simple but totally fine as the experience is still immersive in VR. However the textures and models for some of the sea creatures popped out at me as being the weakest link. Not enough to ruin the experience or anything, but just an observation. The lighting in the sunsets and sunrises are very good and create a fantastic atmosphere for sailing around.\n\nThe sounds in game are good; great lapping waves and splashing against the boat. Overall the ambiance is quite relaxing, though some maps are seagull heavy! On the ocean map there are some audio issues with looping water sounds being obvious because of a hard clipping on the loop rather than it being seamless, likely because of the chaos of the water in that scene.\n\nAs a VR game, I felt no VR sickness which I think is thanks to the cockpit effect of the boat. Interestingly, I also didn't feel a single bit of sea-sickness despite the sway of the boat. I'm not sure if I was just lucky, but it didn't bother me at all. The closest I came to motion sickness was on the ocean, and even then that was more of an adrenaline sensation from big wave drops than actual discomfort. The immersion factor for this game is really high and if you sit on your floor you get a great sense of presence, sitting in your little boat on the water.\n\nIf you are a sailing enthusiast I think this game will definitely appeal to you. Otherwise, I think this game could be good for anyone who wants a chilled out experience of sitting on a boat, looking at the water and soaking in the environment. I anticipate a huge factor in this game's audience is going to be in the direction of its development. If the game goes further into the simulation aspect with more interaction in the realistic operation of boats, etc, I think it will lead to a more satisfying experience for sailing and boat enthusiasts who are out for an immersive experience. But if the game moves more towards letting players sail more boats, including larger ships like the galleon, and in less realistic circumstances (like the ocean or dreamscape relax mode), it could be more of a 'goofing around with boats' game, and the audience could be wider, though less dedicated.", "timestamp_created": 1496068714, "timestamp_updated": 1501711512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31009099": {"recommendationid": "31009099", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992319777", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505082875}, "language": "english", "review": "As a novice in actually sailing this sim is pretty darn fun.

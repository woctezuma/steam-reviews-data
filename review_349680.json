My blood just begins BOILING when I PLAY this GAME! Evil, beware, for the SUPERCHARGED ROBOT VULKAISER shall take you down!\n\nThis TOTALLY ACCURATE retelling of the events of 1977 entails the BATTLE between Vulkaiser, a SUPER ROBOT developed by Professor Amamori with VULKANIUM and piloted by the HEROICALLY quiet Akatsuki Takuya, and the Gogoh Army's EARTH INVASION forces, led by General Roz. \n\nFLYING in the sky, a SYMBOL of JUSTICE, Vulkaiser is near-invincible! Attacks can't even TOUCH its arms and legs, but do mind the reactor in its CHEST. (It doesn't shoot beams.) Armor can only do SO MUCH to PROTECT it, until it EXPLODES! Pressing Z will allow Vulkaiser to FIRE its Shoulder Vulcans (which are, obviously, not located on its head), and it can be fired in a CONTINUOUS STREAM if it's held down. Should one fire LONG ENOUGH, Vulkaiser will fire its MISSILE FISTS when one stops firing, even for a split second. Timed correctly, one can CONTINUOUSLY LAY DOWN a stream of DESTRUCTIVE JUSTICE upon the Gogoh Army!\n\nHowever, Akatsuki is NOT ALONE in his journey! With the HELP of his four PARTNERS, he can COMBINE with a VulFighter to UPGRADE Vulkaiser's capabilities, enhancing its Shoulder Vulcans and Missile Fists into something EVEN BETTER. In addition, he'll gain ACCESS to an OMEGA WEAPON, a potent ONE-USE ability that can LAY WASTE to enemies. This may be UNLEASHED with X. Be strategic in using it, however! You only get one.\n - Yukimasa Murata provides the VulFighter for ROCKET KAISER, a veritable KING of laying down BARRAGE after BARRAGE of powerful BUSTER MISSILES, then FINISHING OFF with a VulCannon. However, the missiles have a SHORT DELAY before BLASTING OFF, so make sure that they are TACTICALLY PLACED down (or is it up?), so that you can SHOUT, \"I have you now!\" at your opponents, without looking like an ABSOLUTE FOOL. Its Omega Weapon is the IRON TYPHOON, a STREAM of ENDLESS DESTRUCTION in front of Rocket Kaiser.\n - Usui Kimiko allows Akatsuki to utilize the NEEDLE KAISER, whose NEEDLE SHOT and NEEDLE STORM have INCREDIBLE RANGE, and its Omega Weapon, CORONA FIELD, blasts anything surrounding Vulkaiser. However, its attacks have PITIFUL FIREPOWER, so don't even think about taking this to a cannonfight.\n - Yamashito Kaiko pilots the Thunder Fighter, which can COMBINE with Vulkaiser to FORM the THUNDER KAISER. Its THUNDER LASER provides both POWER, SPEED, and RANGE, and the THUNDER BLASTER shaves through any EVIL in its way. HOWEVER, its Omega Weapon, THUNDER FLASH, is fantastically WEAK, even if it hits the entire area. This one in particular is a FAVORITE of mine.\n - Jujo Suzuna grants Akatsuki access to the DRILL KAISER, and with it, the powerful DRILL TORNADO, a weapon capable of surpassing the HEAVENS. However, aside from DRILL MISSILE, Drill Kaiser has LITTLE to NO RANGE, as its Omega Weapon, DRILL BLAZER, is simply an EXTENSION of its normal ATTACK.

As a matter of fact, when I watched the trailer for it, I had to double check online to make sure this wasn't an adaptation of a more obscure series. The creators get mad points for that.\n\nSo, at its core, Vulkaiser is a horizontal bullet hell shooter. Coolio. In keeping with its theme of retro anime mecha, your core mech is equipped with a standard, but weak, vulcan cannon. A charge meter at the bottom of the screen constantly fills up as you shoot: activating it fires off a more powerful shot. In addition to your core mech there are four other parts to the Vulkaiser that you can combine with during each stage, each with its own unique weapon. A cluster of missiles, a close-range drill, a weak but screen-filling spread shot, and a wide electric attack. The idea of mixing and matching your mech on the fly reminds me of an older NES shooter, Mag Max, although Vulkaiser is more fleshed out.\n\nWith all of its various mech parts and special weapon gauges, is Vulkaiser worth playing? Yes. I was able to beat the game in my first attempt without dying. I came close by the end, and two of my partners had to bail a la Starfox, but it was doable. But what's cool are the multiple levels of diffculty. Too easy your first playthrough? Crank it up a level. I can see myself coming back to this in the future to try out the harder diffuculties.\n\nIs Vulkaiser the best shooter I've ever played? No. But it's certainly fun and what it lacks in depth in makes up for in style. Totally worth a buy if you're a fan of the genre or of classic mecha anime.

I get they did this to make it seem more \"authentic\" along the lines of the non-widescreen anime of the 20th century, but having it stuck at a constant 400x600 makes it look ugly, gives less space to see projectiles, and causes the steam overlay to act weird, making achievements and notifications take up nearly a quarter of the screen. Also there is no pause button.\n\nContent: While I did enjoy this game I felt like it was kinda lacking in content. For five dollars you get 5 levels and varying difficulty modes. This can get stale quickly and unless you enjoy repeating the same levels over and over, trying to get new high scores or complete different difficulties you may find yourself bored very quickly.\n\nHowever, if you can look past these small flaws this game is very enjoyable and is a great time waster.

But why, oh why have the developers done the things to their game they did?\n\n[h1]Gogoh Invaders from Spaaaaace[/h1]\n\nFor starters, the game is a solid shoot 'em up. As you progress, you can change your robot's features by selecting the modules to use when the game offers to. You have a special charge attack, a Big Red Button, more than awesome music, more than awesome animations in the style of a late 70s anime. You have achievements, leaderboards, trading cards, ...\n\nSo what's wrong with this game?\n\nEverything which is not gameplay-related:\n\n[list]\n[*]You cannot change resolution. You have 640x480 or something similarly small resolution to deal with like it or not. This results all of your other open applications resizing themselves when you quit.\n[*]Also, with such a low resolution you cannot use your Steam overlay while in-game.\n[*]You cannot switch between windowed mode and full screen. The game asks you if you want to go to full screen when you start, and that's it. Once you make your choice, you will stick to it until you quit.\n[*]No options menu. At all. So no volume sliders, no control rebindings, nothing.\n[*]You cannot pause. The devs mentioned somewhere that it's intentional as they want to simulate the arcade feeling where you cannot pause. Yeah, but in the arcade you dropped your quarter and played while it lasted without leaving. However, while you play your computer your girlfriend will occasionally call you (if you have one), the kids will call you (if you have those), and the postman will ring the bell so you need to leave your computer in the middle of your game.\n[*]Related to the previous issue: when you press Esc, the game just goes back to the menu. Without asking.\n[/list]\n\nWhy do I feel angry about all of these? Because this is one of the best shooters I've ever played. Love the style, love the graphics, the music, the controls. Yet they managed to release this masterpiece with all these issues which is unforgivable.\n\nBuy this game for the fun, or avoid it because of the technical execution... Your choice.

The drill figher is way too powerful once you learn how to use it... you can kill boss within 15 seconds of of it's spawn! \n\nThe music is anime exciting and so does the song. The plot of this little shooter is also quite fun!.. planet .. Yummy!\n\nAchievements are quite simple to get except the grind for kills and hard/super hard finish. I have no doubt i can do it with practice but i will pass on them for now.\n\n9/10.. enjoy this alot.. IF i can have fun shooting aliens and robot. so will you!", "timestamp_created": 1470721742, "timestamp_updated": 1470721742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603806", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24711500": {"recommendationid": "24711500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072759293", "num_games_owned": 335, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468009361}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ubc88\ub4e4\uc5d0\uc11c \uac74\uc9c4\uac74\ub370 \uc758\uc678\ub85c \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1470332436, "timestamp_updated": 1470332436, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24468841": {"recommendationid": "24468841", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008101589", "num_games_owned": 519, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469229291}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00c0s vezes eu tenho a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de que sou o \u00fanico gamer do mundo que prefere jogo de navinha na horizontal, e n\u00e3o na vertical.

You can't quite pause the game, change resolution (watch out for the huge Steam popups in the corner) or reconfigure the controls, but if you can get past those annoyances, you're in for a treat. \nJust don't expect to clear the whole thing on the first attempt.

WITH YELLOW SUBTITLES!\n\nIt's pretty gawd-dammed perfect as far as what it sets out to do. You shoot all of the the things while bombastic music plays in the background facing a recurring miniboss and so many enemies that are obvious references to the tatsunoko era of anime. It's very self-aware and pretty glorious. \n\nBest of all, there's actually some interesting design choices for the genre, so you'll actually find a different gameplay experience here. Namely in the health system. Rather than being a 1HP hero, you have a fairly meaty health bar, but it carries over from stage to stage and only gets some repairs between stages. Moreover, your co-pilot partners who act as your powerups also have their own, much smaller, health bars and just like in Star Fox they can get KO'd for good if you're too careless through the short 30 minute campaign. \n\nPlus, rather than a whole bunch of bombs in a stage like most shoot 'em ups, you only get one OMEGA BOMB per stage to use when the going gets tough, so strategic deployment of both your team mates and when you pull out your super move is actually fairly critical. \n\nAnd it's all executed flawlessly. Literally the only complaint I have is that the video used to sell the game with the sung VULKAISER themesong isn't actually in the game. If it was it'd be 110% perfect!\n\nAs it is, I'll just settle for 100% perfect. \n\nGo, Go, VULKAISER!

Invaders from another dimension in another galaxy have arrived to take over, control, as well as enslave Earth! You, the most heroic man of all time and space, must pilot the Supercharged Robot VULKAISER in order to save existence itself from the greatest threat that could possibly be imagined in forever! Whether you grew up with Voltron, know your Ultramans from your Jet Jaguars, or just enjoy quality 2D shooters, there's something for you in this game. \n\nThis is a horizontally-scrolling shooter, but it's more of a danmaku than Gradius or R-Type. Even though I've been using the word \"danmaku\" for over a decade, I only just now looked it up. Apparently it means \"barrage\", and that definitely applies to VULKAISER. The alien armada doesn't mess around, as they'll throw battalion after battalion at you until your health meter is depleted. Yep, this is a shmup with health, and it can even be restored in-between stages. However, you only get one life and no continues. So yeah, you have just one chance to save the world, better make the most of it.\n\nSo how do you handle this situation? With a barrage of your own. The VULKAISER isn't all that effective by itself though. Over the course of each stage you can combine powers with your four best buddies. This results in increased firepower, different weapons, and screen-clearing Omega attacks. The option to swap partners presents itself at various points in the game. Sometimes you'll want a particular weapon for the next area, or the health of your current ally is running low. Yep, everyone has health meters. If they're wiped out, there's nothing you can do for them. Hopefully you can honor their sacrifice by saving the world. This lends a touch of resource management to an otherwise simplistic game.\n\nEach of the six stages offers a good mix of smaller \"popcorn\" enemies, larger battleships, and a handful of mid-sized cronies. As with any other barrage shooter, you have a hitbox that's much smaller than your actual robot. It's rather odd to get used to, even for someone genre-savvy like myself. You'll adjust to it over-time, and the first two difficulties aren't too bad when it comes to throwing bullets around. The sixth and final stage does present a rather sizable jump in difficulty. In my last play-through on the normal setting, I barely eked out a win, even though I went into it with full health. For the most part though, you're going to be crushing loads of enemies with lots of firepower. It's very satisfying. The 70s aesthetics and music have their appeal as well, though admittedly it's lost on me since I never watched Giant Robot shows (Aside from Robotech but that's more Space Opera). \n\nWith play-throughs lasting just under 20 minutes, this game is on the short side. Much of the replay value is going to come from improving upon high-scores and attempting the harder difficulties. VULKAISER isn't a content-rich game, but neither are most 2D shooters. All that really matters is if a shmup delivers on the fundamentals, and I think this one does. The stages are fairly designed, the bosses are well-done, the controls are solid, and everything functions as it should. Also, I believe the shorter than average length works to this game's benefit. The action is tightly-paced and doesn't suffer from any wasted time.\n\nI highly recommend giving Supercharged Robot VULKAISER a look.\n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1444228040, "timestamp_updated": 1444228277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.690659", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18248501": {"recommendationid": "18248501", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034614210", "num_games_owned": 3211, "num_reviews": 151, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443527036}, "language": "koreana", "review": "7~80\ub144\ub300 \uc77c\ubcf8 \ub85c\ubd07 \uc560\ub2c8\uba54\uc774\uc158 \ud48d\uc758 \ud6a1\uc2a4\ud06c\ub864 \uc288\ud305 \uac8c\uc784\n\n\ucc98\uc74c \ubd24\uc744 \ub550 \uc77c\ubf55 \uc81c\ub300\ub85c \uba39\uc740 \uc591\ub355(..)\ub4e4\uc774 \ub9cc\ub4e0 \uac74\uc904 \uc54c\uc558\ub294\ub370\n\uadf8\ub0e5 \uc77c\ubcf8 \ub3d9\uc778 \uc11c\ud074\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9cc\ub4e0 \uac78 \ud310\ub9e4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub354\uad70\uc694.\n\n\uc774\ub984\ubd80\ud130\uac00 \ucd08\uc804\uae30\ub85c\ubcf4 \ubc1c\uce74\uc774\uc800\ub85c\n\ub300\ub193\uace0 \ucd08\uc804\uc790\ub85c\ubcf4 \ucf64\ubc14\ud2b8\ub77cV\ub97c \uc624\ub9c8\uc96c\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc\n\uc0ac\uc2e4 \ubcf4\uae30\uc640\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac 5\ub2e8 \ud569\uccb4 \ub85c\ubd07\uc740 \uc544\ub2c8\uace0\n\uae30\ubcf8 \ub85c\ubd07 + 4\uc885\ub958\uc758 \ud30c\uce20 \ube44\ud589\uae30 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc640 \ud569\uccb4\ud558\uc5ec\n\uac01\uae30 4\uc885\ub958\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9 \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uac8c \ub418\ub294 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ub85c\ubd07\uc73c\ub85c\n\uc288\ud305 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub290\uc815\ub3c4 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ub41c \uc124\uc815\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n(\uc624\ud788\ub824 \uadf8\ub80c\ub2e4\uc774\uc800\ub098 \ubc14\ub77c\ud0c0\ud06c \uac19\uc740 \ub290\ub08c?)\n\n\ucd94\uc5b5 \ub3cb\ub294 70\ub144\ub300 \ub85c\ubd07 \uc560\ub2c8\uba54\uc774\uc158 \ud48d BGM\uc774 \uc77c\ud488\uc774\uba70\n\ubb54\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud574 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d\ub3c4 \uc660\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub97c \ud5a5\uc218\ub97c \uc790\uadf9\ud558\uc5ec\n\uadf8\ub7f4\uc2f8\ud55c \ud558\ubaa8\ub2c8(?)\ub97c \uc774\ub8f9\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ub294 \uc774\uc9c0 \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \uc27d\uac8c \uae70\ub9cc\ud55c \uc218\uc900\uc774\uace0\n\ub178\uba40 \uc774\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ud0c4\ub9c9\uc774\ub77c \ubd80\ub974\uae30\uc5d0 \ubd80\uc871\ud568\uc774 \uc5c6\uc73c\ubbc0\ub85c\n\ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\ub97c \ub9c8\uc2a4\ud130\ud558\uc2dc\ub824\uba74 \uc5b4\ub290\uc815\ub3c4 \uac01\uc624?\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\ub2e4\uc18c \uc2ec\ud50c\ud55c \ub4ef \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubb34\ub09c\ubb34\ub09c\ud558\uac8c \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c\n\uace0\uc804 \ub85c\ubd07 \uc560\ub2c8\uba54\uc774\uc158\uc5d0 \ud5a5\uc218\uac00 \uc788\uc73c\uc2e0 \ubd84\ub4e4\uaed8 \uac15\ucd94\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1443530632, "timestamp_updated": 1443530632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523603", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18219302": {"recommendationid": "18219302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035564749", "num_games_owned": 886, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443355525}, "language": "japanese", "review": "KAISER!!", "timestamp_created": 1443355842, "timestamp_updated": 1443355842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18210385": {"recommendationid": "18210385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041276442", "num_games_owned": 752, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511620376}, "language": "french", "review": "Seulement une chose \u00e0 dire : PIOU PIOU PIOU PIOU !!

It has replayability due to the multiple achievements and the different dialogues between stages. \n\nThe one negative is that it is a little short, but the developers have recently stepped up and addressed community issues, fixing their concerns.\n\nOverall, I'd give Supercharged Robot VULKAISER an 8 out of 10.", "timestamp_created": 1440735622, "timestamp_updated": 1440735622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452280", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17669408": {"recommendationid": "17669408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047810627", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462058015}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3063\u3066\u66f8\u3044\u3066\u3042\u308b\u3051\u3069\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u9593\u306e\u4f1a\u8a71\u30b7\u30fc\u30f3\u306f\u5168\u90e8\u82f1\u8a9e\u3060\u304b\u3089\u306a\uff01\n\u3060\u307e\u3055\u308c\u308b\u306a\u3088\uff01\u5225\u306b\u8aad\u3081\u306a\u304f\u3066\u3082\u554f\u984c\u306a\u3044\u3051\u3069\n\n\u305d\u308c\u306f\u304a\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3066\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u81ea\u4f53\u306e\u8a71\n\u30aa\u30fc\u30bd\u30c9\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u306a\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u306f4\u7a2e\u985e\u3042\u308b\u306e\u3067\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30b2\u30fc\u30de\u30fc\u304b\u3089\u30d8\u30d3\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30de\u30fc\u307e\u3067\u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081\n\u30ef\u30f3\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306e\u6642\u9593\u3082\u305d\u3093\u306a\u306b\u9577\u304f\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u6c17\u697d\u306b\u904a\u3079\u3066\u3044\u3044\n\u6ce8\u610f\u3059\u3079\u304d\u70b9\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306f\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u3054\u3068\u306b\u53d7\u3051\u305f\u6a5f\u4f53\u30c0\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u306f\u5b8c\u5168\u306b\u56de\u5fa9\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3053\u3068\n\u5408\u4f53\u4e2d\u306e\u652f\u63f4\u6a5f\u4f53\u304c\u6483\u7834\u3055\u308c\u305f\u5834\u5408\u4f7f\u3048\u306a\u304f\u306a\u308b\u306e\u3067\u6ce8\u610f\u304c\u5fc5\u8981\n\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u540c\u4eba\u30b2\u30fc\u3060\u304b\u3089\u540c\u4eba\u8ca9\u58f2\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3067\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3068\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u308b\u3084\u3064\u3082\u8cb7\u3048\u308b\u3051\u3069\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u304c\u4e0d\u8981\u306a\u3089\u5b9f\u7e3e\u3068\u304b\u3042\u308b\u3057Steam\u3067\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\u3082\u3044\u3044\u3093\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u304b\u306a\n\n\u305d\u308c\u3068\u5408\u4f53\u306e\u80fd\u529b\u306f\u500b\u4eba\u500b\u4eba\u3067\u8a55\u4fa1\u304c\u9055\u3046\u3060\u308d\u3046\u3051\u3069\u3001\u4e00\u901a\u308a\u3084\u3063\u3066\u307f\u305f\u611f\u60f3\n\u30cb\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb\u3000\u30d0\u30eb\u30ab\u30f3\u3070\u3089\u6492\u304d\u3001\u3064\u3088\u3044\n\u30df\u30b5\u30a4\u30eb\u3000\u3042\u308b\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5f3e\u5e55\u306f\u308c\u3066\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30b8\u653b\u6483\u304c\u3079\u3093\u308a\u3000\u3064\u3088\u3044\n\u30c9\u30ea\u30eb\u3000\u7e26\u7bc4\u56f2\u72ed\u3044\u3051\u3069\u8d85\u706b\u529b\u3067\u5bfe\u30dc\u30b9\u80fd\u529b\u304c\u3071\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3000\u3064\u3088\u3044\n\u30b5\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\uff08\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u3060\u3063\u3051\uff1f\uff09\u3000\u30df\u30b5\u30a4\u30eb\u3068\u304b\u3076\u3063\u3066\u308b\u3001\u3044\u307e\u3044\u3061\u706b\u529b\u3082\u3071\u3063\u3068\u3057\u306a\u3044\u3000\u3046\u3093\u3061\n\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u9055\u3046\u3068\u8a55\u4fa1\u3082\u5909\u308f\u308b\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3051\u3069\u3053\u3093\u306a\u611f\u3058", "timestamp_created": 1440290001, "timestamp_updated": 1440290001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701509", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17647777": {"recommendationid": "17647777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055981406", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440542917}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is kind of like a guilty pleasure of mine though there's nothing to feel guilty about.

I find it charming, and Astro Port brings it here with all of its cheesiness intact, along with a good sidescrolling shoot em up, that has a 4-way variety of powerups and combinations for your giant robot that alters gameplay with each one. For 6 dollars you can't go wrong. And don't expect a pushover game either. On the subject of lives and difficulty, this game runs on the ARMED SEVEN system, wherein you get one life with limited health. You can take a beating, and you get health regenerated after every round, but one life is all you get. I wish the game was longer, but only because of how much joy I had in the short time I had with it. You'll complete it within an hour sadly, but it has good replay value with harder difficulties and additional character dialog, though I still wish it was a bit longer, since wonderful games like W101 do provide more length for their value.  Also, since the game is older than the steam release date would let on, the devs might not have all the new features worked out yet.

As this game is a mock of the above-mentioned animes.\n\nThe Story is extremely simple, you are a new little guy that got picked up to pilot Earth's strongest robot (70's cliche basic plot). You fight Aliens that decided to invade Earth (70's mecha plot standard).\n\nThe Game is also mock the infamous and terrible \"Yellow-Subtitles\" that is found when downloading old anime online. It's called HK-Subs or HK-Releases. Hong Kong release these animes with EngRish Subtitles, colored Yellow and it's laughibly terrible. \n\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nAs a 2D shoot-'em-up game, there's nothing much to highlight about the gameplay.\nYour robot has support team, where each one has unique plane that combines with you that gives you different weapons and abilites. Vulkaiser can combine into 4 different planes to become \"ThunderKaiser, DrillKaiser, NeedleKaiser or RockerKaiser\"\neach has their own weapons set and super attack.\n\nThe game is challenging, where you will see \"Bullet-Hell\" moments a lot. and no power-ups other than the mentioned support planes. and no HP-Regeneration until Level-Complete (just a small health boost though.\n\nThe Game consists of 6 Levels (Probably more with hard and Super Hard modes), each level in a different location (Earth, Space, Monster's body, etc..) and a unique boss.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Game only run at 4:3 screen with 640x840 Resolution\n- You can't modify game files. A shame really i wanted to put some other music from my favorite 70's mecha shows.\n- Game can be beaten in 15~30 minutes, afterwards nothing much to do except playing again and again to get all the achievements or trying harder modes.\n\n\n[h1]Similar Games[/h1]\n-70'S ROBOT ANIME GEPPY X (PS1): Both games are extremely alike, both mock up the 70's mecha genre. This game however, has FMV Opening, Ending and even \"Mid-Episode\" Commerical Ad. It's like a TV Show!\n\n-Mazinger Z (MAME): except it's vertical but pretty much similar.\n\n-Gradius (NES): same game, instead of robots, it's a space jetfighter.\n\nI Hope i wrote everything about the game that let you decide weather to get it or not.\nBut if you want my advise, Unless you are 20~40 years old that remember the good old days of robot shows like Mazingers and Getter Robo, and/or if it's not in \"unregrettable-price\" sale, don't get this game.\n\n7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1439332662, "timestamp_updated": 1439332662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559748", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17472971": {"recommendationid": "17472971", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193980682", "num_games_owned": 432, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498966359}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent, simple but a very good 2d shooter.", "timestamp_created": 1439215077, "timestamp_updated": 1439215077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17451781": {"recommendationid": "17451781", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998590213", "num_games_owned": 549, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442624663}, "language": "english", "review": "I was entertained!", "timestamp_created": 1439087407, "timestamp_updated": 1439087407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507956", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17441858": {"recommendationid": "17441858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140529138", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440939949}, "language": "schinese", "review": "http://www.bilibili.com/video/av2830846/\n\u6e38\u620f\u65b9\u9762\u5f88\u68d2\uff0c\u901a\u5173\u4e86\u8d85\u7ea7\u56f0\u96be\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u5f88\u6ee1\u8db3", "timestamp_created": 1439032384, "timestamp_updated": 1453738472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509619", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17438053": {"recommendationid": "17438053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078815095", "num_games_owned": 843, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439014158}, "language": "english", "review": "This brings back memories!\n\nThe game is a short giant robot shoot em up.

This game shakes up combat by offering you an upgrade every so often, which will augment your current robot into something with better weapons, which is cool.

The first, definite eyecatcher is the delightful homage to mecha sentai anime of the 1970s that suffuses the whole thing, from the cheesy intro and theme song all the way down to little details like those yellow subtitles that should be familiar to anyone who's sat down to watch anime in the VHS days. This weakens a little in the actual game, which has some pleasantly goofy but otherwise very unimpressive spritework, including some enemies who emerge from the background, but barely signal their transition into the field of play by simply becoming lighter colored. The projectiles are the usual bullet-hell menagerie, without any particularly interesting patterns or designs. It's a definite low-res affair and not much to look at.\n\nGameplay uses the \"charge while firing\" mechanic seen in some games like Hellbound, where after firing for a while you fill up a meter (with accompanying audio cue) and can unleash a minor \"super\" attack. This is initially quite weak. However, the one small novelty is that, in lieu of powerups, you can choose to fuse with one of your four teammates, each giving you an additional secondary fire and upgrading your super attack to something more useful. Each one is meant to have its own situational niche and style, and they do a pretty good job of distinguishing them. As far as I can tell so far, you get your pick of any of the four to start with, but it seems like, thereafter, you can only choose to take or decline a single randomly chosen one at certain fixed points in the subsequent levels. It appears levels give you one pick at the beginning and another shortly before the boss. Functionally it's still a fixed-position powerup system, but it does at least add a little bit of choice in your playstyle and strategy.\n\nAll in all, though it's decent, I'm not strictly sure I could recommend this for shmup fans at large, but those with a fondness for chintzy, hot-blooded old mecha shows might find the style enough to propel this robot into their Steam libraries.", "timestamp_created": 1438300059, "timestamp_updated": 1438300059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.712371", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17306554": {"recommendationid": "17306554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153931916", "num_games_owned": 362, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498521230}, "language": "english", "review": "Well...

As a big mecha fan I really enjoyed the homages to the different super robots of the 70s with their bright colours and funny looking enemy designs. That being said the game itself is quite short but that doesn't stop it from being fun.\n\nThe game consists of four levels of difficulty and the option of playing the launch mode straight away or practice mode where you can access all six levels and get used to the level before trying it on the launch mode. An interesting feature with this game is that bullets are able to hit your hands and feet without you taking any damage, Vulkaiser's chest is your hitbox and as long as it doesn't hit an enemy blast you won't lose health.\n\nYou have the option to combine with four different types of support units or face the enemies alone with the base Vulkaiser and its rocket fists. Be careful though, if your support unit is destroyed during a stage it cannot be repaired. My personal favorite is the Lightning unit since it can clear mass swarms of enemies and is great for boss fights.\n\nSome things that the game can add to make it better include:\n-A pause button, something that can really help since you're forced to play the whole six levels in one go.\n-An options menu, this is a big one since there's no guide to the control keys. Luckily I played the Satazius demo and learned the keys from that but if I went in blind, I'd be absolutely lost in terms of controls.\n-Additional levels or the choice to choose levels after being defeated. Whilst the game is short it is a bit frustrating to hit the last boss and be forced back to the first level and go through everything again before getting back to the boss.\n\n\nI'm a big mecha fan and if you enjoy side shooters and giant robots then this game is for you. It's short and sweet but something about it makes me want to keep shooting away at hordes of enemy robots and their retro design.", "timestamp_created": 1433888075, "timestamp_updated": 1433921266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562820", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16263277": {"recommendationid": "16263277", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994086084", "num_games_owned": 525, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433698258}, "language": "english", "review": "A good chunk of my early play time with Supercharged Robot Vulkaiser was spent with a grin on my face. As someone who\u2019s watched his fair share of old Japanese cartoons, it really is a well observed little thing. From the slightly cheap looking splash screens, the pompy music, even the loading screens and level title cards, it\u2019s chock full of character. Then there\u2019s the game itself, you\u2019re a giant red robot who can fire his fists like missiles and combine with his co-pilots like Power Rangers. \n\nIt\u2019s not all just for colour either, which pilot you combine with affects your type of attack. Take Rocket Kaiser for example, combine with him and your shots will be accompanied by powerful missiles, with the charged weapon essentially being a huge bomb, great for taking down powerful enemies, but a spread of enemies could easily swarm you. In that case you\u2019d be better off with Needle Kaiser, a wide shot type, but she\u2019s weak both in terms of armour and damage dealt. Drill Kaiser is hugely powerful, but her range is tiny, meaning you\u2019re putting yourself in danger every time you attack. Thunder Kaiser is something of a mix, his standard attack has decent range, his charge shot is powerful, but his bomb is feeble \n\nSupercharged Robot Vulkaiser has a peculiar kind of difficulty, the most notable thing is that it must be beaten on a single credit, there\u2019s no continues to be had. Playing on the easy difficulty I\u2019ve raced to the end of the game, once not even really trying whilst capturing our First Play video. The step up to the next difficulty level though made me hit a wall I\u2019ve struggled to get past. I\u2019m not sure what it is that\u2019s stopping me from getting better at the game, it could just be that I\u2019m not the gamer I used to be. I do sometimes feel a bit blind to the incoming bullets, but no more than any other shooter, but I think it\u2019s actually more to do with the shame of Vulkaiser. Your hitpoint is fairly small, still easy to hit, but only a tiny part of your giant mech, but because you\u2019re essentially controlling a giant line whilst looking at the enemy, it\u2019s very easy to drag it in to incoming fire.\n\nSupercharged Robot Vulkaiser is a little sparse in terms of modes. There\u2019s the story mode and \u2018training\u2019, which is just the main missions there for you to retry. I\u2019m not sure Supercharged Robot Vulkaiser is the game to spend hours practising, learning patterns. The training mode does allow you to complete stages though, opening up the next one you couldn\u2019t reach in a single run. It\u2019s not a bad way to see the later levels on the harder difficulties, which at least helps keep things interesting. If you are chasing score then it does separate them by difficulty, and I think the scoring system works by rewarding you for destroying enemies as quickly as possible as they appear on screen, so maybe there is something to be said for spending the time learning patterns. \n\nIn terms of presentation, the game has no resolution options. As soon as you hit play though you\u2019re presented with the option to go full screen, which may seem like a small thing, and does cause some problems on a 2 screen set up, as it merely changes your resolution to match the game\u2019s. It\u2019s welcome though, we\u2019ve reviewed a couple of games in the past year or so that haven\u2019t had that option. One of the drawbacks though, and this is kind of funny if you\u2019re not playing seriously, is it means that when you unlock an achievement, or a friend signs in to Steam, you can\u2019t see a third of the screen. So if you are planning a serious run at the game, maybe turn off notifications. \n\nThere\u2019s no doubting Supercharged Robot Vulkaiser is fun, but a lot of that comes from its charm. It does a great job of harking back to old-school anime, both in tone and theme. I\u2019m less sure the game itself rates as highly or holds up to repeated playthroughs. Which is a shame, I really like the mecha gimmick of combining with the other pilots, and their strengths and weaknesses do add a level of strategy to the game, it\u2019s just a shame the level design doesn\u2019t build on it, instead feeling more like a shooting gallery. Still, for the price it\u2019s a fun bit of nostalgia, hard to dislike, and not something you\u2019ll have seen too often", "timestamp_created": 1433785696, "timestamp_updated": 1433785696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619290", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16241365": {"recommendationid": "16241365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020630762", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479517740}, "language": "italian", "review": "http://www.games969.com/recensioni/supercharged-robot-vulkaiser-recensione/ la nostra recensione!", "timestamp_created": 1433681556, "timestamp_updated": 1433681556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16212848": {"recommendationid": "16212848", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994666064", "num_games_owned": 2641, "num_reviews": 545, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433213149}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Esse jogo \u00e9 quase um anime dos anos 70!\n\nAdorei a apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o desse jogo, ele \u00e9 bem uma simula\u00e7\u00e3o de anime dos anos 70 com tra\u00e7os bem antigos mostrando personagens com cara meio arredondadas, com todo aquele climinha de her\u00f3is japoneses e rob\u00f4 gigante, muito bom!

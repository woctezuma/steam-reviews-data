THIS GAME IS AWESOME! I hardly have anything negative to say about this game. If you enjoy 2D style fighting games, with tons of defensive mechanics and solid gameplay, you WILL enjoy Punch Planet!\n\nGameplay: 10/10 This game has super responsive controls, unlike fighting games ive played recently. There is no input delay, it just feels really good to play. The gameplay is very deep and intuitive, giving each player an array of customization in they're fighting style with each character. I've played this game for 78 hours and have yet to run into two people who play a character the same way.\n\nGraphics: 10/10 At first look, this game looks like a 2D animated game. No, thats just what the unique art style wants you to think. These are 3D animated characters that have been beautifully rendered and animated with fluidity and it shows. The game looks great in motion and is a joy to watch. Shadows, lighting, and colors are all sharp and sort of pop off of the screen at you. Just gorgeous.\n\nAudio: 10/10 The soundtrack of this game will be stuck in your head hours after you play it. The tracks never get old or repetitive. They are unique enough to sound like music you've never heard before in a video game but also destinct enough to leave a lasting impression in your mind. Great music that fits the theme of a fighting game, set in the future, on distant planets in outer space.\n\nOverview: The game is a masterpiece. Its in early access right now, but for base price ($20) you get 4/8 playable from the start, 3 stages, practice mode and online pvp. Story/Arcade mode is coming as well as player vs cpu. Updates are almost weekly to the game, keeping it fresh and adding to the replay value. There is also a very active and welcoming community in the Punch Planet discord, led up by the three developers. You will have fun and you'll meet a ton of awesome people willing to help you with the game. Join here: https://discord.me/page/punchplanet\n\nI would highly recommend this game, its a breath of fresh air to fighting games and has an awesome lore supporting game as well. Pick it up, I promise you wont regret it--\n\n- Strtfghtr88", "timestamp_created": 1511582946, "timestamp_updated": 1511582946, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37216150": {"recommendationid": "37216150", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967142337", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513725857}, "language": "english", "review": "Great start into early access.

Rumor is the next two characters are some kind of power ranger looking guy that is supposedly a real shoto, and a battletoad bigger brawler type.

Every character currently in the game (4 of the final 8) looks incredible, and I'm super excited to see what the other 4 will be like!\n\n-Great characters! Every character plays different, and plays fun! You've got Roy, who kind of fills the place of a shoto, by having reliable projectiles and decent all-around skills, and on the other side of the spectrum you have Tyara, a giant space-amazon, who's the giant, slow grappler, who has a level-4 720 throw super that takes off around 70% of the opponents life, which feels SO GOOD to land!\n\n-GREAT gameplay! Throw in a batch of good feeling Street Fighter-esque footsies, jump-ins, and cross-ups, mix in a whole mechanic that involves cancelling ANY move so that you can squeeze more attacks into your combo, and to top it off: Third Strike parries. What do you end up with? An AMAZING feeling fighting game, that I can see myself playing for a long-time to come!\n\nX The one negative thing I have to say about the game is that I wish there were more of it. And that's hardly a complaint, because the creators are working to put in all kinds of features: An Arcade and Story mode, more stages, and the 4 additional characters I mentioned before.\n\nI'm writing this review for completely selfish reasons, I WANT this game to succeed, because the bigger it gets, the more possible content I can wring out of it, and the longer I can play it!\n\nTL;DR\nThis game's amazing!

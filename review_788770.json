In gioco \u00e8 possibile usare sia la tastiera che il mouse, oppure solo tastiera. \nI suoni sono anch'essi molto semplici: alcuni effetti sonori e una musichetta nel menu e durante la partita.\nNon ho critiche da fare su questa categoria. Lo stile \"minimale\" si adatta bene, anche perch\u00e8 in 60 secondi non si ha molto tempo per guardare i dettagli.\nForse la traduzione inglese non \u00e8 delle migliori ma si capisce abbastanza. Non \u00e8 presente la lingua italiana.\n\n\n2. Gameplay e storia\nIl Gameplay \u00e8 molto semplice. Si hanno 60 secondi di tempo prima che un meteorite distrugga la terra.

You'll spend more times in menus and dialogues instead of actually playing the game - just because of the lack of a single button.\n\n(2) You play the entire game with the keyboard, but for planting the nuke receiver you suddenly need to use the mouse - I almost had to search for a guide to find out how to do it because there's no hint on that. You also can't open the pause menu with ESC or something, you have to click a button with your mouse. Really, how hard can it be to implement consistent controls?\nUPDATE: You'll now get a hint that you place the receiver with the mouse.\n\n(3) Upon launching the game, it shows you the famous control mapping options most Unity games have. However, remapping any of the controls doesn't do anything because the controls are fixed in the code. Removing buttons from the options and replacing the fixed controls by mapped controls in the code literally takes less than 5 minutes, wtf. This would also fix (2).\n\nFor a free game it's pretty good. Despite being such a small game, it lacks a bit of polishing.

Apart from the irritating stock controls - 'G' is hit, 'H is kiss?! Surely 'H' should stand for hit and 'G' should stand for 'groom'. Also, the 'kissing' mechanic is utterly bewildering, with it indicating to you that it'd be a friendly action but then causing all the women-folk that I immediately besmooched to be ravaged with hatred - at one point there was a literal clusterfuck of about 8 women kicking the shit out of me - I was begging for the meteor to hit me by then! Not a problem i've ever had in real life, that's all i'm gonna say - my backhand is way too strong haha. Also, it was literally impossible to kiss the streaking man, a missed opportunity in my opinion.\n\n9/15 - generous as it's a 30 second download and it provides 15 minutes of fun - by that maths a

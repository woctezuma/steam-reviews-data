The protagonist wakes up from stasis (having been in stasis since CW2 roughly) only to discover the majority of humanity was completely wiped out by an alien species known as the Creeper. The story goes into much more detail as you play. It's okay to not play the previous games as the story can be easily figured out for those new to the series but does make references to past titles in the series.\n\n[h1]Sound:[/h1]\nEvery unit and action in this game has its own unique sound effect, making it easy to know when and/or which unit has blown up, landed, fired, etc. without even looking for it.\n\n[h1]Friendly Units (RTS):[/h1]\nThe units in CW3 are fantastic. Every single unit that is used has a purpose and does it extremely well. Normally in an RTS there is only a handful of units the player would use but in CW3, its better to use practically all of them! You start off with the fairly cheap but still useful cannon. As you go through the game you begin to unlock other units such as mortars, Strafers (jets that strafe the Creeper), transport aircraft, etc.\n\n[h1]Enemy Units (RTS):[/h1]\nThe Creeper also has its fair share of units to throw your way. Everything from the standard blob/horde creeper to those that can stun your units, prevent air units from firing, etc!\n\n[h1]Content:[/h1]\nWhat CW3 does in terms of content puts similar AAA studios in the same genre(s) to shame. The story alone has around 20+ missions. Each taking anywhere from a few minutes to a an hour (all depending on your playstyle and experience). CW3 also contains what is essentially a random map generator (known as the Dial Map Device (DMP). This powerful generator gives you hours of possible designs. If you want something a little more specific, CW3 also offers a map editor that is equally powerful in tools. This review can't even comprehend the full scope of content available (and I am not even getting into maps added by other players in the community).\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nThe meat and potatoes of this game is amazing. It's highly addictive RTS like design (though you can pause or even speed up gameplay at your whim) will keep you on the edge of your seat. Like most RTS's, you start off by placing down what are known as collectors that gives you power. Collectors are also used to transport resources to your other units (like \"ammo\" for your turrets). A faster alternative are relays which can quickly move resources around and has extended range but are more expensive and don't produce energy. Players could put down reactors for a large energy boost but take time to build and could put you in a 0 energy status (bad!). You will encounter maps that may force you to go on the heavily defensive while others could have you be suppressing literal volcanos of Creeper from oozing out! There is so much I could cover for gameplay but you will just have to try it out yourself to experience it!\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nFor the 3rd game of the series, this only adds to the formula and improves everything else. For its price as well (lowest I saw was $2 a few years ago I believe) you will get so much bang for buck. Get it now!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1516265810, "timestamp_updated": 1516265810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39424426": {"recommendationid": "39424426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254960111", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1078, "last_played": 1516316574}, "language": "english", "review": "A vastly unique experience that provides interesting challenge and fun throughout.

Honestly I recommend it even if you don't like TD because it plays completely unlike a tower defence game even though it takes a lot of the mechanics from one. It's not about hammering bricks of HP enemies while they trundle through a maze, every hit on the creeper has an actual effect on it, and there's no silly waves of random enemies to throw off your plan, the level is clear what's going to be thrown at you, you just need to find a way to deal with it.

Creeper World is a game where you build towers to defense yourself in the early game and then you build towers to offense the enemy :D \n\nEvery game starts with placing Command Center. It produces few energy. Then you need to \"conquer\" as much as possible neutral territory with Collector building to increase production of energy. While you are doing this the blue thing called Creeper is constantly conquering other territories. Then it tries to conquer you. You start building towers. It costs energy. Towers are shooting, CC sends extra ammo. It costs energy too. \n\nSo, there comes the first great feature of the game, Creeper World is a strategy game where you need to find the perfect balance between production and consumption of energy. It is easy to conquer territory in the beginning, but it is much harder to defend it, because each tower consumes a lot of energy. The larger territory produces more energy but requires more towers. If you are greedy you will lose. In this game you need to think strategically. Find the safest place, make defense, be sure that it is unbreakable. Then start your offense.\n\nSo as I said at first this game is a survival city management. Pretty cool!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1235205395\n\nUsually you need to kill all Creeper hosts to complete a level. So there starts the second part of the game, Offense. When you have unbreakable defense you need to produce enough towers, prepare enough energy for ammo and find the place where you will attack. In the first missions of campaign you just take enemy territory by small steps. In the later stages it doesn't work. You need to find the weakest spot of enemy, make artillery preparation, when send air fleet and then comes with ~15 pulse cannons. After that you will have 10 seconds to clean a small piece of territory from the creeper and build a Relay for recaharge ammo of your towers. It is really easy to lose, but you will feel incredible feelings when your the small assault succeed and you will have an small blockpost in the heart of enemy territory.\n\nActually, it's the hardest part of each mission,  make an succeed assault. You are like commander Eisenhower which controls Operation Overlord. Awesome experience.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1235205423\n\nThere is also a good story line with a kinda interesting plot. Game designers made great jobs, each new story missions offer you new buildings/enemies/game features. So it engages you until all campaign is finished. I passed it in less than 12 hours for 2 days. It was a game with really fresh gameplay mechanics for me. I was surprised\n\nPros\n- Fresh gameplay idea. It's really cool\n- Well done campaign with good story and interesting variation between missions.\n- A lot of stuff after completing the campaign: custom missions, daily missions, missions made by community.\n- A lot of ways to complete any mission.\n\nCons\n- Sometimes confusing controls. You can't deselect unit with right button. You must click Cancel button.\n- No difficulty settings. I suppose it could be really hard for casual players.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1235205477\n\n[h1]Resume[/h1]\nA great strategy game with fresh mechanics.

Some emitters spawn creeper, that slowly flows downwards following the shape of the map and destroying all your undefended structures. Your role is to fight back the creeper with defensive structures, generate enough energy to sustain the defense and finally push back the creeper and destroy the emitters.\n\nAn interesting aspect of the concept is that there is no \"bad\" AI trying to beat you, but the creeper is just following gravity. So you can precalculate exactly, what will happen, and plan your defense. You may try to secure high positions, defend strategically important point, rush to destroy emitters or try to generate a lot of energy and prioritize your defence, always wondering if your strategy was the best.\n\nOtherwise this is a very conventional tower defense game, which makes it easyly accessible and after some time a bit boring. Nevertheless, after I was bored by the repetitiv game play, usually I come back 2-3 months later and have a lot of fun again.

But I'll let you see those for yourself!\n\nCreeper world three takes the cake in how it has a very fun map editor; I have just as much fun playing my maps as I do making them! It has its own scripting language, and you can learn it to make more advanced maps like you see in the story but otherwise it's very easy to make a basic map.\n\nThis isn't even the biggest winner in my book. When I said variety, oh boy did I mean variety. The creeper is smarter, faster, thicker, it takes over and uses technology against you, the maps are bigger, everything is better. It's hard to put it to words for me, specifically. The time I've spent in this game is time I don't regret. Oh, did I mention the soundtrack? It's great. \n\nI'll not even bother adding the pros or cons, this game is great all around.

It's still as much fun as when I started and I still find myself challenged by some maps.\n\nThe amount of content is truly mind-boggling. I've honestly just scratched the surface. There are thousands of pre-made maps and an infinite amount of randomly generated and community-made maps. There's everything from easy 5min runs you can sleep-walk through to 5-hour-long battles where you always find yourself on the brink of extinction and claw for inches against overwhelming amounts of creeper. If you ever tire of the gameplay - there's dozens of achievements to chase and some really clever community maps to play, that take advantage of the scripting capability. And every single map has an online leader-board if you are looking for competition.\n\nI've never encountered a bug or technical problem. All the settings, from hotkeys to color schemes are customizable. The game loads and runs extremely fast, even on my rather anemic computer. You can play everything at your pace, since you can pause or save/quit at any moment, so even multi-front battles are quite doable. The base mechanics are simple, there's about two dozen buildings at most, but there's still a lot of different play-styles and unit preferences, which are all pretty viable.\n\nIf you are at all interested in strategy or tower defense this is a must-buy!

Imagine my surprise when I saw it on steam....and a third edition, no less! Needless to say, the game has come very far since its flash days. I think it may even still be a flash game. Regardless, this version has so much content to offer, it is ridiculous. You start the story with a few towers and have to fight the Creeper, which is basically a fluid that flows down different terrain levels. You can collect energy in the early levels, which lets your command node send out packets of ammo and construction to build things or destroy Creeper. Later, you unlock Anticreeper which uses the same mechanics as Creeper, but it helps you out instead! Each level unlocks more towers and more areas of the game, such as the super-hard Alpha Sector and player-made maps on the DMD(Dial Map Device). Play any number of thousands of missions provided for you after you beat the story (not the best, admittedly, but for this type of game, great). Get bored of that? Make your own maps to grind achievements on or challenge what you thought was possible! Hate the colour purple or light blue? Change the colours of both Anticreeper and Creeper to suit your eyes. Simply a unique game that will provide hours of enjoyment for tower defense fans.\n\nIf I only had one complaint, it would be that after you initially hold off the Creeper and get yourself set up collecting energy, you can always win and steamroll over the Creeper. It has no AI so there is nothing that will surprise you after you beat the storymode. That being said, the amount of different towers and ways to win each level are great to provide some variety instead of simply using a blaster and mortar each time.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1507936015, "timestamp_updated": 1507936015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35631368": {"recommendationid": "35631368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153790018", "num_games_owned": 386, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514394600}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best strategy games I've ever played, and the only game to inspire me to write a sci-fi novel.

So, I have a guilty pleasure and that is these \u2018creeper\u2019 games and today I\u2019m reviewing Creeper World 3:  Arc Eternal.  If any of you have been following my reviews you may find this odd as it is an older game from my first experience of this series:  Particle Fleet (made by the same developer) but the honest reason is I didn\u2019t know this game type even existed until Particle Fleet and I still wasn\u2019t sold that this wasn\u2019t a one hit wonder so I cautiously bought the game you see now.\n\nI\u2019m doing what:  This game is an odd mesh of genre\u2019s:  Part tower defense, part base builder but all real time strategy when it comes down to it.  However, you aren\u2019t going to see many controllable units (aside from fighters / bombers) and even those you really aren\u2019t micro-managing as they are told to strike an area and generally left alone (nothing in the game can actually damage them).  Your first encounter with this may leave you with a \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d kind of thought but as you keep playing you will find the complexity comes from the buildings themselves and not the core game (as all great strategy games have).\n\nLoud Noises:   Like the later game of the genre (the above Particle Fleet) the music is very good, though I do tend to turn it off after several hours of playing it.  My friends have an overwhelming annoyance with the cannon sounds\u2026not sure why.  To be fair, the gun sounds can be obnoxious from an onlooker\u2019s perspective.  I just don\u2019t mind all that much as I\u2019m usually listening to something else.  In addition the graphics are very simple; but I\u2019m glad they are as the game is about the gameplay not the graphics or particle effects or really even the sounds (though, again, the music is really good).\n\nMultitasking:  One of the amazing things about this game is the \u2018casual\u2019 nature of the gameplay itself with the possibility of improvement to a competitive level.  That sounded a bit word-salad but what I mean is the game isn\u2019t really \u2018hard\u2019 but more of a challenge that can be relaxing like a brain teaser and I found myself using this game as a wind down at the end of a night or after work along with watching a movie or podcast; nothing too intense.  Now, if you are trying for the leader boards then get ready to white knuckle because there is some serious optimization to be had.  In the end, however, I am happy with my slow paced game for the purpose I\u2019ve set for it.\n\nOverall, I make no qualms in that this game is a guilty pleasure of mine.  This game is not for everyone; it can be a bit slow paced (or fast depending on you).  I\u2019d earnestly recommend that everyone gives this a try, especially if you are a management, strategy or puzzle fan.  I also have to mention that there appears to be a near endless amount of content.  I actually forced myself to uninstall this game as I was playing it instead of moving on to other games in my library.  At worse, wait for a sale as the game does get pretty cheap during those.

This means that, once you know what's going on, if you can build a stable base in the beginning, you have already won the map. Victory is inevitable so long as you dont over-extend yourself. This KILLS any real thought of strategy once new elements stop being introduced or combined in new ways.\n-The real question is how QUICKLY you can win, which means the only true challenge you'll face is when a level has a time limit of some kind or has a component within it that requires fast progression.\nThis ALSO isn't necessarily a bad thing. There's a sort of catharsis to this game's war of attrition, even if the deck is decidedly stacked in your favor\n-The game DOES have scripted sequences where unexpected changes occur, changing the map and, likely, ruining your immediate plans and requiring a new strategy. But they arent used to their fullest potential and rarely occur if at all.\n\nWhat I was looking for:\nThis game is very good for what it is. (it is the THIRD game in a series of similar games after all. Lots of refining has happened). That said, once its novelty passed for me, I just couldnt stay interested, even WITH user generated contet.\n-Once I realized that victory is basically inevitable in ANY situation without a timer and learned how to deal with any situation a map could throw at me, I lost interest.\n-What I REALLY want from this game, that it CANNOT deliver on due to its own systems and design, is a war of attrition decidedly in the enemy's favor. Where DEFEAT is inevitable, but preventable and the only question is how long you can survive.\n-The strategies you have at your disposal are not varied enough to make this kind of play truly interesting. The game is set up so that, outside of timing and basic idea, you are constantly just improving on your initial strategy adding more and more units as you build your base.\n--Initial decisions have virtually NO bearing on later strategies. Outside of success or failure, the strategy you start with has no bearing on whether you'll be successful in later parts of the level. I would have LOVED a \"path less traveled\" sort of design where one decision means you CAN'T have somthing else down the road.\n\nSo ya, it's a good game, worth the buy, but it didn't really scratch the particular itch I had.", "timestamp_created": 1503672373, "timestamp_updated": 1503672373, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461888", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34453967": {"recommendationid": "34453967", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999459739", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 285, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503544983}, "language": "english", "review": "Tower Defense is such a limited genre, there are only so many variations to the style of defense you can have but that did not stop this little gem from having a whole lot of imagination.

Le digitalis permet d'influencer le d\u00e9placement du creeper si celui-ci est dominer par le creeper, mais il permet \u00e9galement de dire aux runners ou ils doivent se d\u00e9placer. Les runners sont des variantes de drones de Creeper world 2, encore un point positif pour ce jeu.\n\n[h1]Mode \u00e9diteur[/h1]\n\nLes modes \u00e9diteurs de Creeper World ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 connus pour \u00eatre facile d'utilisation et de compr\u00e9hention. Tout types de joueurs est capable de cr\u00e9er une carte unique facilement et rapidement. Les cartes de Creeper World 3 peuvent atteindre une taille maximal de 256 sur 256 ce qui est exceptionnellement grand pour ce jeu, encore un point positif pour Creeper World 3. Mais ce qui est la base de la c\u00e9ation de cartes uniques dans Creeper World 3 est sans doute le [b]CRPL[/b].\nLe CRPL est en temps normal un langage informatique, mais le d\u00e9veloppeur de Creeper World 3 a d\u00e9cider de le mettre \u00e0 disposition des joueurs pour leur permettre de cr\u00e9er des niveaux exceptionnelles. Et contrairement \u00e0 ce que l'on peut croire, cr\u00e9er un niveau \u00e0 partir de language informatique n'est pas difficile ! Le site de knuckle Cracker permet aux joueurs de d'apprendre \u00e0 g\u00e9rer le CRPL quelque soit leur exp\u00e9rience avec ce language. D'apr\u00e8s ma connaissance, Creeper World 3 est le seul Tower Defense qui met du language informatique \u00e0 disposition de ses utilisateurs. Encore un point \u00e0 ne pas n\u00e9gliger.\nDe plus, on apprend grace au d\u00e9veloppeur du jeu que l'on peut se servir de toutes les cartes de Creeper World 3 via le fichier qui est d\u00e9dier au jeu pour s'en servir en mode \u00e9diteur ! G\u00e9nial ! :)\n\n[h1]Nouveaux modes de jeu[/h1]\n\nCela \u00e0 un rapport avec le CRPL, mais je vais simplement citer ces modes qui sont ceux qui pourraient prendre le plus de votre temps dans le jeu :\n[*] Puzzle (Il y en a plusieurs types)\n[*] Sleeper (meilleur mode de jeu du jeu selon moi)\n[*] Particle\n[*] PAC (Mode de jeu qui vous ferat jouer \u00e0 la place du creeper)\n[*] Votre mode de jeu (Il est possible grace au CRPL de cr\u00e9er VOTRE mode de jeu)\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nJe pense que pour le moment, Creeper World 3 est le meilleur Creeper World jamais sortie, sa durer de vie n'est m\u00eame pas mesurable ce qui montre que c'est un excellent jeu, je ne vais pas faire un discours pour d\u00e9crire \u00e0 nouveau le jeu, je donne la note de 20/20 pour toutes les am\u00e9liorations et nouveaut\u00e9s apport\u00e9es dans le jeu, Jeu addictif, venez nombreux :)", "timestamp_created": 1500776006, "timestamp_updated": 1500853438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33673485": {"recommendationid": "33673485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096608094", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 2844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510510694}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun mechanic, and sometimes a fun game, but there are things I really don't like about it. It feels too much like an amateurly produced indie game, even though really the game is solidly designed. Challenge has little to do with survival -- it's more like, if you screw up, you're going to spend another half an hour building something that actually works. And the mechanics of unlocked tech are often poorly explained, leading to exactly the kind of confusion that causes you to screw up. Since tech is unlocked in almost every mission, as far as I've played, the result is a somewhat frustrating experience. To be clear, I don't think this is the developer's fault -- the game is solidly put together, it's just that its mechanic tends to overwhelm and destroy when you make a mistake. I'd recommend it if you're looking for inspiration in your own game design projects -- but not so much if you just feel like playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1500561042, "timestamp_updated":

A pesar de que tecnicamente cuenta como tower defense no tiene nada que ver con ese g\u00e9nero sobreexplotado que tiene miles de juegos gratuitos. En este juego las torretas no se ponen en toscas casillas predeterminadas, si no que el mapa est\u00e1 dividido en una rejilla de casillas peque\u00f1as donde puedes elegir la posicion de las torretas con total libertad salvo en algunos niveles, que ocurren en planetas destruidos rollo Alderaan.\n\nHay un mont\u00f3n de estructuras, algunas ofensivas y otras defensivas, que se van desbloqueando poco a poco. Cada una de ellas es suficientemente unica para que merezca la pena, aunque solo unas pocas son imprescindibles, siempre sientes que te conviene usarlas todas siempre que puedas.\n\nEl enemigo tampoco es convencional; se trata de una baba azul (llamada el creeper) que se comporta como un fluido viscoso. Tan pronto como es generado por los emisores se extiende tanto como puede a lo ancho, normalmente asta llegar a una zona a menos altura (los mapas estan divididos en 12 capas de altura, la capa 0 es el vac\u00edo, y la capa 11 est\u00e1 reservada para el creeper y no se puede construir en ella) en la que cae a la capa inferior, la cual sigue  cubriendo asta desbordarse. Debido a esta mecanica la mejor estrategia es empezar a construir tu base en una zona elevada si el mapa lo permite, ya que el creeper, por naturaleza, cubrir\u00e1 los valles primero.\n\nTodo esto significa que a diferencia de los tower defense tradicionales, el enemigo no sigue una ruta especifica, sino que se expande en todas las direcciones posibles poco a poco.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, la forma de construir torretas tambi\u00e9n es distinta. Al empezar un nivel debes colocar un modulo de comando en el mapa (es m\u00e1s o menos el doble de grande que la malloria de estructuras), y alrededor suyo debes empezar a construir colectores que te alludar\u00e1n a producir energ\u00eda, que se usa para construir y dar municion a las estructuras. Las estructuras se conectan entre s\u00ed si estan cerca, lo que tambi\u00e9n significa que tienes que expandir tu base poco a poco o tus estructuras no recibir\u00e1n suministros.\n\nY si no est\u00e1s convencido, hay precuelas del juego que puedes jugar gratis online, t\u00fa busca creeper world user space, o creeper world evermore en google, y te saldr\u00e1n entre las primeras opciones. Ya de por si estas versiones son buenas, pero esta versi\u00f3n de pago es incluso mejor, con mejores mapas, m\u00e1s tipos de enemigos, m\u00e1s armas, la capacidad de terraformar el mapa...\n\nLo \u00fanico a tener en cuenta, no probeis creeper world 2, porque esta version es completamente diferente al creeper world 1, evermore, user space, y 3. No es que sea malo, es solo que el gameplay es totalmente distinto y no se deber\u00eda tomar en cuenta a la hora de comprar este.", "timestamp_created": 1498575672, "timestamp_updated": 1498575672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32825027": {"recommendationid": "32825027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194626929", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 37, "last_played": 1515870597}, "language": "english", "review": "The best one in the series", "timestamp_created": 1498501064, "timestamp_updated": 1498501064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536243", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32803820": {"recommendationid": "32803820", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984757685", "num_games_owned": 487, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507281397}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best tower defence games I have ever played.

Most of the praise it gets is well deserved. However, despite me typically enjoying tower defense games, Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal grew very monotonous. After some time, almost every map felt and played the same.[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay feels novel in the first few hours with a very interesting, new enemy. You are fighting against a physically more or less correctly behaving liquid that never stops flowing until you destroy its source and will slowly, but surely drown you otherwise. I have played around 8 hours now. The first ones were exhilarating with new towers types being slowly introduced. However, after all new towers have been shown to you, the novely quickly wears off. Every map plays more or less the same. Even though I really enjoy turtling in strategy games, here it becomes very repetitive and tedious.\n\nThere are hundreds of maps to play, but with the story being extremely forgettable, there is no incentive for me to keep playing this game. This is a good game, no doubt. \nFor me personally, Creeper World III didn't draw me in as much as Defense Grid, Kingdom Rush or Defender's Quest.\n\nThe music is appropriate, but with only six tracks

I call foul.\n2) Campaign - It seems choppy at best, and broken as worst.  sure I was able to beat it.  but most of the items you have at your disposal and the fact that even two ore harvesters cannot support one single ore spitter for continuious fire is sad.  then there are the titans.  Useless in ever case.  even on the missions you may want them they take too long to fire, the creep comes back too fast even on 1x speed to do anything tactical with them, and the last one is only for the end mission, you don't even get to use it on special missions after you unlock it.\n\nnow for the reason that this game is great!\n1) it has user/mod like interface.  looks to me (haven't finnished all bonus sectors yet) that you get to make and share with other players in these maps.  maybe they just modify/test them first to make sure you don't screw over the comunity, but this is a rather interesting idea.\n2) the story is actually decent.  Sure it may seem obvious at times, and others down right boring.  However, if you decide to read it all (storyline) you get an interesting story.  one worth talking about to friends and family.  Just like when you read a good book, or new article.\n3) Replayability - Sure the leaderboards are broken, but you can still post your times and strive to improve them, come up with new and interesting ideas on how to beat the levels, and even strive to limit yourself in ways not ment (like only cannons and solor collectors)\n\nIn the end this game is worth picking up, yet I would think nothing more than $10 for the short campaign limit, but the extra sectors do make up for the loss in gameplay.  Just wish they had some kind of RPG element sector where you gather things/currency and use them to improve/unlock different items to use in the next mission (like if you could boost yourself with a starting ammount of energy or something)  of course this would destroy the leaderboards in that sector, but that would be something like score rather than just time (like -points per sec and +points for builds and kills.  Also give you a point handycap for bonuses, and a point bonus for detriments)\n\nAnyways if you like Tower Defense or base building you may want to check this game out.", "timestamp_created": 1486083267, "timestamp_updated": 1486083267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29647406": {"recommendationid": "29647406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022992262", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511422664}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Zaman ge\u00e7irmek ve e\u011flenmek i\u00e7in arcade tarz\u0131nda e\u011flenceli bir strateji oyunu.

The tags say this is a tower defense game, but it is really it's own thing.  I suppose tower defense is the closest thing to what it is but it is a bit misleading.\n\nSo what it is?  The premise is you have to fight back the creeper, which behaves pretty much like water pouring out of a spout (or more than one most of the time).  It slowly spreads from it's source, and is stopped by walls and higher ground until it fills up the area below and reaches the correct height.  To fight this, you build cannons, mortors, flying craft, anti-creeper producers (your beneficial creeper than cancels out the other creeper) and a few other weapons.  These are your \"towers\" but they are all mobile and can be placed anywhere they fit.  To support them you need to produce energy, which comes from nodes that cover the ground and reactors.  The nodes link up to others and need to link back to your base to produce energy and supply your troops.  Reactors don't need any ground to cover and produce more.  Troops out of supply will soon use up there reserves and will no longer be able to use their abilities.\n\nSo for gameplay you will slowly spread out over the map, extenting your network and fighting back the creeper until you reach the sources and take them out with special weapons.  That's the basics but there is more.  There is a scripting language for the maps that lets them bend the rules.  There is one, non-story level where you control a man through a maze who shoots and finds keys for instance.  To top it all off, there are literally thousands of maps (most likely, I didn't count).  The main story is only a very small part of the game.  After completing parts of it other areas open up, which are basically user created maps, beta testing maps and challenging maps.  If you like the game enough you could spend thousands of hours on it, I'm sure.  I was content with just the main story and a few other maps though.\n\nIf this looks at all interesting to you, do yourself a favor and pick it up.

What I found was a highly addictive and unique stragegy game.\n\nYou face the creeper: a flood, literally, a fluid enemy pouring across the battlefield from emitters.  Later encountering corrupted machines and other new threats and rule-bending forces.  Your typical mission begins by dropping your HQ either far enough away or on defensible enough terrain to build up your economy and weapons to begin pushing back.  Branching out your energy network to lands secured by weapons fire (or other interesting units and abilities) to allow units to operate further and further afield, advancing step by step, until close enough to set up a special unit to destroy its source.\n\nThe games many maps are very diverse.  Fighting on all sorts of mundane and exotic planet surfaces, fragmented worlds, moons, asteroids, vast artificial structures etc.\n\nYour economy is energy.  You recieve a constant income of energy from collectors and reactors, which require either plenty of creeper-free land or large investments of energy.  Energy functions as the building material for units and their ammo.  Losing a chunk of your income, or a link in your network of collector and relay nodes, or just spend it on doing too much at once and your weapons will have only several seconds worth of stored energy before that wall of firepower becomes a trickle, or nothing at all.\n\nThe main con with this game I think is that, with the exception of a few time sensitive missions, you are very unlikely to lose once you have built a decent defense early in the mission.  Once that is accomplished, a player be as slow and patient as they like, lazily inching things forward one at a time as much as terrain allowed.\n\nI might have played CW3 that way, and been left with a feeling I wasn't challenged, and that there weren't many important strategic decisions to make... if not for one simple feature: leaderboards for best completion times.  This is one of the few games that have managed to interest me trying to get into the Top-Whatever ammount.  I recommend doing so, it greatly enhances CW3's challenge and replayability.\n\nUnfortunately, the leaderboards are polluted with illegitimate scores, particularly in the main campaign and most popular other maps.  I mean times well below what it takes to build, charge and fire a single nullifier even in the best conditions filling the Top 10's and 20's; with legitimate champs finding themselves in around the Top 30's... so at least it's still meaningful to be in the Top 100's.", "timestamp_created": 1480071218, "timestamp_updated": 1480078473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27419650": {"recommendationid": "27419650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042368119", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511559888}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a tower defense style game, it is focused around resource management and defeating the creeper.

For all of Creeper World's unique building types, interesting building connections, and neat other ideas -- you're still fighting water. The story tries to turn the \"purple water\" into a menacing all encompassing alien blob, but it doesn't behave like one. Heck, the water moves in a really non-aggressive way like waves lapping at the shore. If you want a game with AI that adpats to your playstyle, look elsewhere.\n\nThe most stressful time in any given match is the first few minutes when you're building your base up. I've hit restart numerous times because of acting too slow (mostly since I'm watching TV at the same time); however, once you're up and running defeating creeper is not really about strategy or skills, it's more like a waiting game. You'll be slowly grinding out the time of waiting for buildings to construct or moving your buildings around. The only way this game is interesting is that it allows speed players to post their completion times for everyone to see.\n\nWhile I do fawn over pixel art, Creeper World is very dated even for pixel graphics. There are loads more mobile games that look better than this. I will say that the strongest aspect of the aesthetic is the soundtrack.

Time for another review.   This time: Creeper World 3.  I'll just start right out by saying that I freaking love this one (and also that I've played it for more hours than it shown here... I hate pointing that out, but people get all weird about it).\n\nCreeper World 3 is, at it's heart, a tower defense game.  The absolute most basic concept of placing towers or turrets to defend against an advancing foe is here.  And of course you have energy and such to manage.  But that's about where the similarities to normal TD games end.\n\nThe heart of CW3's genius is the enemy you face, simply known as Creeper, or Creep, whichever.  Instead of lots of seperate enemy units running at you in lanes (which ALWAYS seemed so freaking stupid to me in other TD games) the Creeper is a sort of... blue/purple goo.  EVIL goo.  This stuff spreads pretty much like you'd expect a liquid to, and the game renders/simulates/whatever this liquid really, really well, over a landscape that consists of varying levels of elevation (or sometimes, blank void areas that nothing can flow into or land on).  Your main targets in most maps are Emitters... big spiky blue things that are the source of the unending slime.   They just keep pumping it out, non-stop.  Since the Creep is pretty just a mindless liquid, it's behavior is very predictible.... but the fact that it's a liquid means that it can flow pretty much anywhere.  This is not a foe that's restricted to pre-set lanes.  And remember, this stuff JUST KEEPS COMING.  Sure, maybe a deep gorge might hold it for awhile.... but as it keeps pouring into that, eventually, it'll overflow.  It can get anywhere, eventually.\n\nFortunately though, breaking the norms yet again, you also have the ability to work anywhere on the map.  Your towers are not restricted to specific spots like in most games, and this is the other half of the brilliance of the game.  If there's available space, you can build something there.  And most of the things you can build are actually pretty darn small... you can fit TONS of things around, which you'll be doing.\n\nJust dropping towers isnt enough though.  Like I said, the Creeper NEVER STOPS COMING.  As long as emitters exist, they'll keep making more.  They'll never stop until you destroy them.  So you cant just hold a defensive line forever.  And this is why, unlike other games, you're actually expected to ADVANCE, taking more and more territory for yourself, and reaching and destroying each emitter or other major enemy structure.  To accomplish this, your turrets can fly.  You can uproot them at any time, and give them orders to move to any other spot where there is room.  It's simple, and you'll find yourself doing it really, really often.   It's a major part of the game, and has alot of possible uses.\n\nOf course, you have your limitations.  You only have so much energy to go around, and this energy is generated by your \"network\", made up of collectors (pull in energy from the surrounding landscape), reactors, and relays, among other things.  Collectors and relays create lines between them; energy and other resources can flow along this spiderweb of nodes, usually in the form of little colored spheres or blocks.  For the most part you really only use energy when something is requesting it; when building a new object, or when an old object needs a refill on energy/ammo/ore/whatever.   So your energy usage will leap up and down depending on what you're doing... dealing with it isnt simple as your network grows into more and more of a hideous tangled mess.  \n\nAnd there's so much more than just that... the network is complicated enough, but the game has tons.... and tons.... of different mechanics and turrets and gizmos to use or deal with.  There are things like Strafers, which arent turrets at all but are planes that launch from pads you build, which will go off and perform strafing runs against the goo in whatever area you tell them to.  Not everything is a tower.  That fact adds even MORE complexity.   On the other side of things, not every threat is the Creeper itself.   Early on you'll be introduced to Spore Towers, for instance... nasty structures that sit there for awhile charging, before letting off this huge blob through the sky towards your structures.  Or a variety of other things that exist to assist the goo and make your job so much more difficult.  \n\nThe good thing is, the game does a really excellent job of easing you into all of these different concepts.  The campaign is very good at teaching you.  However, one way or another the complexity is very high here.  Be prepared for a complex challenge.... but that's what you want, isnt it, from a strategy game?  \n\nThe best part though is that this game has incredible replay value.  After you're done with the campaign, there's all sorts of other stuff to do.  Including downloading and playing maps made by other players, or using the random map generator (which in itself is very highly customizable, so you get the sort of map you're looking for) to create new challenges for you on demand.  I've seen plenty of players get hundreds of hours out of this game... the replayability absolutely is backed up by the game's incredible depth and potential for challenge, and is something you can just keep coming back to.\n\nAnd one other thing I'd like to point out, and this is possibly the best part for me:  This is a very ACTIVE game.  Alot of TD games have you sitting around waiting for stuff.  But this?  No.  There's always something for you to DO.  When you're not setting up defenses, you're pushing forward.  When you're not dealing with your towers, you're expanding your network, or perhaps changing Strafer/Bomber routes, or dealing with an unexpected breach in your defenses, or perhaps using your terraformers to deform the terrain or build walls (yep, you can do that in this).... and all sorts of other things.  If you ARE finding yourself  in a dull moment, typically it means there's stuff you COULD be doing... you just arent.  And that can come back to bite you pretty hard, so you want to make sure you're always aware of your options at all times.  Really though, the game's flow/pace is superb.  Always something happening and always something to do.... no moments of sitting there and waiting.  Oh, and you can speed up time, too, if you want.  I never really do that myself though.  And there's a ton of approaches to every situation.  Your playstyle is up to you... the game generally doesnt force you into specific approaches.\n\nOh, and a word about the graphics:  They're fantastic.  This is a colorful, VIBRANT game, where everything stands out, yet is very easy to differentiate.  It's super easy to see what everything is at a glance.  Overall I really just freaking love the way this game looks.  \n\nOverall, I really cant recommend this game enough.  This is a brilliant strategy game that breaks so many of the usual rules of TD games, replacing the broken bits with new bits that are so much more awesome and fun than the old bits.  If you love strategy games of any type, if you love a challenge, and if you want some real, major replay value, something you can constantly come back to.... you'll find it here.  I cant recommend this enough.\n\nJust... try not to move your towers directly ONTO the goo.

IT IS TERRIBLE. This is the main problem I have with this game and the other games in this series.\n\nI mean, the campaign itself is fine and great fun to play and I would HIGHLY suggest playing it, but just do yourself a favor and either skip the ancient aliens plot, just ignore it or don't get ajita whenever someone makes a terrible space story like I do. Some of the ideas brought up in the game are interesting, but I personally didn't like the end narrative.\n\nAnother thing to note is despite the story being terrible, it isn't forced down your throat to the point that it detracts from the game. It's just something that's basically there, really. Without it, you're building towers to shoot liquid. This is FUN in itself, desperately trying to hold back the flood of death. The story feels more like its just there just because it needed some sort of story besides \"there's death liquid that will fuck up your shit that you need to shoot\". For this purpose, the story does fine.\n\nAll in all, I'm satisfied by the decision to purchase this game. I find myself coming back to play it every once and a while.

I suppose it can be done in half that time. \n\nThere are tons more content even after the achievements. The biggest problem is probably how the ruleset is almost identical on every map.\n\nSuggestions for the creator. Multplayer: Allow comments on map. Notify players when their map has a comment or time is beaten. Notify players when their time is beaten. List maps with newly beaten highscores. Rank players on how many 1st rank they have on maps. Chatroom? There is SO much that can be done for a competetive multiplayer scene in this game. The current DMD is pretty bare bones. Go steal some inspiration from super mario maker or similar. (How about co-op maps? Too difficult?)\n\nMap making: Ditch the obscure scripting language for javascript or similar. Allow multiple map campaigns that allows some progression. Where the outcome in one map can affect following maps. For example custom tech tree unlocked over several maps like in the original campaign. Or campaigns where the final map can be played from start, but can be made easier if you choose to beat other maps before it. Or variable prices, or unit prices or unit strength.

I'd call it real-time strategy. Regardless, I don't normally like tower defence or RTS, but this game is the exception to both. Maybe that's because this game takes those ideas and adds a simple but robust concept for the enemy units that you're fighting against.\n\nThe best news for you is that you can play a free demo of all the Creeper World games on the web via Flash or Unity webplayer. If you want to find out what people are gushing about, just go try the demo. You don't have to download anything (other than the browser plugin), just play it in your browser. If you like tower defence or RTS, definitely play the demo. Even if you don't, but you're somehow reading this out of curiosity for this game, try the demo anyway. Take it from a guy who normally dislikes both of those genres, and just look at how many hours I've played Creeper World III.\n\nThis is essentially a much-improved version of the first Creeper World. The game has a built-in map editor, and also seed-based procedural generation for random maps. This is in addition to hundreds of pre-made maps of varying difficulty.\n\nAs of the time of this writing, this game still has an active community of dedicated and gifted players who are still adding custom maps each day. There is much opportunity for modding. In addition to the map editor, there is a built-in scripting language so you can essentially reprogram the game (within limitations I imagine, as I've never personally experimented with it), and I've seen players come up with some very creative ideas such as maps where you play as the Creeper and maps where the enemy has units similar to your own that are controlled by AI, maps with fog of war, maps with booby traps, and the list goes on.

It is a major time sink, hours go by without me even noticing. There's hundreds, even thousands of different maps and missions to choose from.\nPersonally my favourite section is the player made custom maps and missions, they feature many different scenarios and events, even some new things not present in the base game like new units and new enemies. It's really great seeing all these things people have made, there's strategic maps people have made where you have to plan ahead and think carefully, wacky maps that are fun and light hearted, play as creeper maps where the role is reversed and you are the creeper assaulting a base, custom scenarios of different kinds made by people, it's all varied and quite fun to play.\n\nAnother feature is a random map generator, where you put in the features you want, like map size, terrain type, and other variables, and the generator will create a random map based on what you want from it. For people who want a challenge, there's a section of the game dedicated to randomly made extremely difficult maps, some of which are literally impossible, others close to that. Most of them can be done, but they require a lot of thought and careful action to get there. For people who want a more casual experience there's a section dedicated to easier maps that have items called \"artifacts of Odin\", and the goal is to collect these items scattered throughout the various planets. There's also a campaign which features some interesting levels which teach you the game, some of which are quite tricky.\n\nThe premise is that there's this entity called the creeper, that has been ravaging the universe for a long time. It spreads from planet to planet, creeping across like a liquid, and it is your job to simultaneously put up a strong defence to hold back the tide and to also effectively assault the source of this enemy. It's a cross between a tower defence, real time strategy and management sim all in one. You have to position your units, manage supply lines, organise your base, respond to the changes of the battle, manage your resources, extend out in an effort to attack whilst at the same time making sure your defences will hold. You have to be careful with what you do and choose a playstyle, do you turtle up, building up a strong defence capable of weathering the incoming assault at the cost of allowing the creeper to multiply thus causing future expansion to be slower, or do you reach out early for a preemtive strike, weakening the creeper early or gaining a strong foothold, at the risk of overextending and leaving gaps or weaker parts of your defence? There are different ways of playing this all depending on your own individual playstyle and what is better for the map you are playing.\n\nYou can play this at your own pace, there's the option to play it at normal speed, 2X, 3X or 4X speed, and you can also pause the game and issue orders whilst paused, useful for assessing the situation on a large map where a lot of things are happening at once and you need to be controlling the battlefield in all these areas simultaneously.\n\nIn terms of stability, this game is very stable, there's few bugs (I'm not even sure I've noticed any), it runs well and doesn't require high specs. It's a lot better in this regard than many big name titles made by whole studios, and this was afaik made by one person. \nThere's a fair amount of UI options and a few graphical options which are all quite nice to have.", "timestamp_created": 1469183264, "timestamp_updated": 1469183264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24431185": {"recommendationid": "24431185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068321310", "num_games_owned": 459, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509656206}, "language": "english", "review": "nice different strategy gameplay and real swell music get it", "timestamp_created": 1469046934, "timestamp_updated": 1469046934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24413318": {"recommendationid": "24413318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198266914661", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502889693}, "language": "czech", "review": "hra zabav\u00ed n\u011bkter\u00e9 levli jsou t\u011b\u017e\u0161\u00ed", "timestamp_created": 1468956271, "timestamp_updated": 1468956271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24402632": {"recommendationid": "24402632", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974880509", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514152872}, "language": "english", "review": "Very enjoyable", "timestamp_created": 1468907123, "timestamp_updated": 1468907123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24375937": {"recommendationid": "24375937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051259966", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469005397}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

Dial Map Device)\n\nCons:\n- Storytelling tries to be way too \"epic\" but is simply tedious (maybe the later missions will make up for it?)\n\nReview:\nThis game is a perfect match for me. It's an RTS, but you basically set your own pace, so it's much less stressful than something like StarCraft. Don't get me wrong, I love StarCraft, but Creeper World 3 somehow manages to make the RTS experience relaxing and rewarding at the same time.\n\nAt the time of writing this review I have about 19 hours in the game, and I've barely scratched the surface of the content available. I'm maybe 1/4 of the way through the campaign missions, and have yet to play any of the thousands of player-made maps, or the practically infinite map generator called Dial Map Device.\n\nThe campaign missions are interesting, and somehow keep surprising me with new challenges. The storytelling is pretty bad, though. I feel like writer tried too hard to make it feel like a super epic novel, but it just ends up being tedious.\n\nOverall it has been well worth the $2.99 I paid for it.

Sometimes this is difficult, but I rarely lost levels except for when the layout was something I hadn't seen before (for example, some levels have space between usable areas of land). As long as you don't overbuild, there are almost no scenarios where a previously defended area will get overwhelmed.

Because:\n\nWhen I first started playing it I thought it was going to be my new favorite game. And it was for like a week. But of course the \"introductory phase\" is never the same as when you get into the \"meat\" of a game, and that's where things got frustrating.\n\nMainly cuz it's just boring. Feels like a game in search of an x-pack (at [i]least[/i] one x-pack!) \n\nNot enough diversity in terms of friendly or enemy units/activities = not enough diversity in gameplay overall = game gets boring real quick.\n\nMap-wise, no complaints about the amount of content. There are hundreds if not thousands of maps I have not played, and theoretically unlimited content via parametric map generator and fan-made content. But the actual gameplay is so boring I would basically have to force myself to play it at this point. (Achievements, u know...)\n\nThe usual response to the \"boring\" complaint is that \"you are playing it wrong\". (IKR?) People apparently get a kick out of playing this game in a \"speed run\" style, because high scores are based on speed. At that point, though, it becomes more of a puzzle game and those just don't interest me at all. (Or at least, they interest me [i]extremely[/i] rarely...)\n\nOne thing that might alleviate the tedium a little is if there was smarter UI logic/assistance when it came to placing your collectors (basically solar power plants which you have to at least attempt to place somewhat optimally or they are useless). Right now you can semi-automatically lay them out in a line. This game would be less unjust vs. humanity if you could quickly lay them out in a grid. (i.e. keep the exact capabilities of the current placement \"tool\" and just make it work in 2 dimensions instead of just 1.) I find myself spending a lot of time doing these tedious set-ups at the beginning of each map, that practically take as long as the gameplay portion.\n\nBut of course the pros are like \"you are not supposed to be building 200 collectors and spending 45 minutes on a single map!\"  OK, but even when I play short games, the setup takes too long.\n\n........\n\n[b]So, while I ultimately don't \"NOT RECOMMEND\" this game\n\n-- as critical as I am, it actually takes a LOT for me to \"NR\" --\n\nif [i]I[/i] was looking for a pure Tower/RTS-defense kinda game... [i]I'd[/i] appreciate the advice if someone told me my time was probably better spent elsewhere.[/b]\n\n(And that being said, I'm not 100% sure but I think I got this game in a bundle and probably effectively paid <$2 for it so .. not like I rly regret buying it anyway.

I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\n[h1]Gameplay [/h1] \n\nCreeper World 3: Arc Eternal is a perfect mix of RTS and Tower Defense along with aspects of slight management. You fight against a liquid like and versatile foe known as Creeper. This game has infinite, and I do mean nearly infinite replayability. Once you finish the base story you can go and do thousands of more missions created by the creators and the community. This is the best strategy game I have ever played. There is not much in this world like being completely surrounded by Creeper and slowly, ever so slowly pushing back and destroying every last piece of it. There are tons of ways to beat levels whether you want to attack swiftly with risk or play for a longer game to build your layout to counteract the ever attacking foe. You can even create anti-creeper or terraform the land around you to add even more to this games amazing functions. Overall this game has a very unique and formidable foe and is the best and one of the most exhilarating strategy games I have ever played. \n\n[h1]Graphics/Sounds [/h1] \n\nI love the look of the creeper, weaponry, even the terrain. The music fits with the game giving an adventurous and formidable feel of the unknown. \n\n[h1]Pros/Cons [/h1] \n\n[b] Pros [/b] \n\n+ Unique game playstyle \n+ Enormous amount of replayability \n+ Addicting \n+ Ranges from super easy to maps where you will wonder who was sadistic enough to make it\n+ Huge amount of maps to play\n+ Good story\n+ Map editor\n\n[b]Cons [/b] \n\n- May becomes repetitive to some\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1] \n\nI remember playing the first Creeper World on kongregate and thinking \"I love this game, holy crap it's amazing\". Next came Creeper World 3: Abraxis and I played it the moment it was available and again loved it but wished there was more than the 12 missions and then around a year later I got Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal on steam.  I love the game, just love it. This is definitely one of my favourite games to ever play. I also found out a while ago a new game which I think is called Particle Fleet is being developed by Knuckle Cracker and I really hope it makes its eventual way onto steam since it looks amazing. This game to me is a piece of true satisfaction and fun. This is a mix of two of my favourite types of games which are RTS and Tower Defense and it has combined those two perfectly in my opinion.\n\n[h1]TL;DR [/h1] \n\nCreeper World 3: Arc Eternal is a great mix of RTS and Tower Defense games. It has a unique and constantly attacking foe known as the Creeper and is an astounding strategy game.

Every building and weapon costs energy to build, and most cost energy to maintain, forcing you to constantly expand to new areas to build new collectors/reactors to beat creeper back by few tiles more until you can escape (CW1) or kill it for good (CW2/CW3)\n\nThat's it. But the way Creeper interacts with shape of the map means that there's a lot of strategy involved: where do you set up a defence? Can you cover the valley with collectors AND fortify it before creeper floods it? Do you go for tight grid of expensive but efficient and easily defensible reactors or for wide and redundant but hard to defend net of collectors? What combination of weapons will you use?

You build towers to limit the spread of \"the creep\", something that spread like goo over all areas of the map like the Flood in Halo, except smaller. Weapons can limit them, but the only way to stop them on a world is to destroy the creeper emitter on the world by building a nullifier near it. However, nothing can survive in the creep... thus, you need to build a network of nodes to power the turrets, push back the creep, and eventually reach the emitter and shut it down. \n\nAs you advance from world to world, system to system, creeps get... creepier. They get spore throwing towers (shoots a blob of creep anywhere on the map), but you get beam towers to defend against such. The defense \"digitalis\", which was supposed to destroy creep at the molecular level, had been subverted and now creates \"pathways\" to spread, but cannons and such can roll back such until you can destroy the digitalis emitter. Runner nodes generate small runners that can suicide, but you have \"sniper\" turrets against such. Then \"glider\" nodes with weapons defend against intruders near its paths. \n\nTo counter those, you get better turrets. Mortar (ignores terrain), sniper turrets (mentioned before) that goes after runners and such but limited to line of sight, beam turrets against incoming spores (some are launched up to 4 at a time), sprayer to spray \"anti-creep\" (AC), bombers to drop larger qty of AC, strafer to slow a valley of creep, Guppy transport to move AC, energy, or ore around maps that has disconnected islands, Big Bertha cannon (takes out a big chunk of creep), better control nodes (longer range) and much more. \n\nYour command module along with collectors and reactors generates the power to power all the turrets. The trick is find control terrain to limit the creep to a section of the map, then roll it back section by section, by controlling key terrain much like all RTS games, without running out of power. \n\nYou are some sort of warrior awakened after millenia of sleep, only to find desolation all over the galaxy, ruins everywhere, signs of combat and creep everywhere as well, shields and warp inhibitors did not save the worlds, but your strategy and deployment of units may. As you advance from world to world, star system to star system, your encounters gets worse and worse, enemies gets more and more complicated, but you get more and more toys to play with. \n\nWhile graphics are low-fi and 2D only it does not distract and in fact, keep the frame rate high and creep is sufficiently creepy enough. There are also visibility options to turn stuff on/off to help visualize the battle, with zoom. However, there is no edge scroll... You have to use WASD to scroll if you are zoomed in. \n\nIt is different enough from regular tower defense to give you a good challenge, but it does get a bit boring after a while, or frustrating, as energy management is crucial, and there is no manual. Read beginner's guide on Steam before getting started. \n\nVerdict: Try.

There's a fluid mechanism that makes it possible for the slime to build up and spread out, which is kind of neat (e.g. if you're on top of a hill, the slime will take longer to reach you and it flows into cracks and valleys first).\n\nSo, the one player campaign begins nicely enough, you get introduced to units and game mechanics. The story is also interesting (and is mainly what kept me playing). However, it seems that on every mission there is always something new; a new unit or building you need to take into consideration that does one special thing which you need to take out some specific enemies. They're not exciting or add much to your strategy, except \"to kill unit X you need unit Y\". Which doesn't give you much choice of an attack strategy at all, except to build whatever is required to make it through the level.\n\nAnd this is where the game fails the most - every level is a [i]grind[/i]. You quickly set up your defense perimeter, but once you manage that, it's slowly building up an attack force and inch by inch moving away enough slime to get to an \"emitter\", destroy that, and do the same for any other stuff you need to destroy. You know you'll make it, it just takes time and there aren't many surprises.\n\nSo, on top of not being very challenging or exciting except the first five minutes of every level, it takes between 45 minutes to over an hour to finish one. When you're finally done trudging through, you breathe out in relief - not satisfaction. Then you get annoyed because it has taken so damn long, and 90% of it was just waiting for things to happen.\n\nSo, to sum it up:\n\nYays:\n* Interesting campaign story\n* Fluid dynamics are nice\n\nNays:\n* Levels are a grind\n* Too specialized units make things more annoying than exciting\n* Tactics are more or less the same every level\n* Takes too long to finish a level\n* Only exciting first couple of minutes on every level, after that it's just routine", "timestamp_created": 1451418427, "timestamp_updated": 1451418536, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595687", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20062733": {"recommendationid": "20062733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102223966", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451830701}, "language": "russian", "review": ",,,", "timestamp_created": 1451383562, "timestamp_updated": 1451383562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20059993": {"recommendationid": "20059993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010859055", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452901034}, "language": "english", "review": "nice", "timestamp_created": 1451374820, "timestamp_updated": 1451374820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20050739": {"recommendationid": "20050739", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982002801", "num_games_owned": 669, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506536605}, "language": "english", "review": "Really unique and fun strategy game, completely caught me by surprise! \n\nIt's tagged as tower defence and RTS but it feels very different.

I liked the first better than the second, so when the third returned to the same style of gameplay, yet improved, buying it was a no-brainer.\nI have played many hours on number 3 before it gor released on steam, and more after.\n\nMost levels consist of establishing a beach head / base then beating back the unrelenting flow of creeper. When you reach their spawners, you can destroy them. When the last is gone, you win the map. Other levels have a master spawner that when killed destroys the others. Do you head straight for this one, or soften up the resistance first? The choice is yours.\nYour main recource, energy, is often the most deciding factor.\n\nPro's:\n- Nice long story arc.\n- Endless ways to complete levels.\n- Replayability to beat your previous best time.\n- Level editor.\n- Big community of custom levels.\n- A ton of levels ship with it outside of the story arc.\n- Programmable units (for custom levels).\n\nCon's:\n- Easy levels can get repetetive (\"Just mopping up\")\n- Some of the smaler maps are insanely hard (could also be a Pro rather that a Con... ;-) )\n\nGraphics / sound:\nThe game has simplistic graphics which is nice to look at, and more importantly, not so dazzling and cluttered as to confuse you. The soundtrack is good for the first few hours, but wheres a bit thin as the hours rack up. It can be muted in favour of what ever you like.\n\n\nI give this game 10 / 10 , It is one of the few games I keep returning to for another couple of maps.\n\n(PS!

It is up to the reader to decide whether the statements found in this review is favorable or otherwise.\n\nIntroduction:\nCreeper World 3: Arc Eternal is a RTS strategy game whose role of the player is to stop a corrupted fluid-like army from invading the galaxy. You command an army of automated buildings that shoot lots of stuff in order to prevent the fluid from spreading and destroying your base. These buildings are your bread and butter to fend off and destroy the fluid emmiters and win the game.\n\nPros:\n1. The gameplay and its mechanics are really in-depth, and in each situation comes with a new strategy towards the game. Fend off even terrain with fast-firing cannons and low-land areas with strong long-ranged mortars, moving your base across space with, as well as weakening the enemy with ships and AC bombs. The campaign is designed for the players to explore each of these mechanics, as well as taking advantage of them in order to gain an advantage over the enemy.\n\n2. There are tens of thousands of maps to play, both from the original official maps and custom-made maps from the workshop. Each map brings a different situation for the player to deal with. Besides that, creating a custom map is relatively simple and does not require any advanced form of coding or game designing knowledge.\n\n3. The player is given a great amount of flexibility with various amounts of structures for them to build and control the game with, each being unique in their own way while complementing others.\n\n4. The game kept me playing for longer than I've expected. Despite it being repetitive after some time, it was still pretty fun to play. An affordable game for a reasonable price.\n\n5. When playing on a larger scale, the animations look kinda cool. It's always fun to watch your beloved \"minions\" go fight it out and do stuff.\n\nCons:\n1. The soundtrack is too limited, repetitive and lacks randomization. I can memorize all of the battle songs after a few hours of play time.\n\n2. The graphics are a little basic and simple, but this is not a big deal as the gameplay is much more significant in this situation.\n\n3. The game acts sort of like a math question without much penalty Once you reach a stage where your buildings are self-sufficient in defending against the enemy, you can just sit back and don't do anything. From this point onwards, it will just be clearing out what's left of the enemy army, slowly but surely. Not much of a challenge up to that point.\n\n4. To be honest, I was not very intrigued by the story, and I found myself skipping the storyline after playing the first few missions of the campaign. The method of presentation was tedious and boring.\n\nPossible Improvements:\n1. Ambience in the game would be nice. The songs do not have to be in a consecutive loop without end all of the time. Just play another song in a-minute-or-two intervals, something like Minecraft or Starcraft. That way, the player would appreciate the songs even more, and it brings a more exciting atmosphere into the game.\n\n2. The presentation of story would easily be more attractive by using methods such as vocalized dialogs, pop-out characters, cutscenes (if budgetable) and subtitles.\n\n3. The GUI and graphics could be improved.\n\nConclusion:\nCreeper World 3: Art Eternal is a must-buy game for those who love tower defense and puzzle games. With an affordable price, the game is a pretty good choice in comparison to the more expsensive AAA games in the market. If not, the mechanics is something that makes the game worth exploring and trying out.\n\nI would give this a 7.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1449548041, "timestamp_updated": 1494032948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19521919": {"recommendationid": "19521919", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969236281", "num_games_owned": 681, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451262559}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun take on the strategy genre.", "timestamp_created": 1449396119, "timestamp_updated": 1449396119, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19506051": {"recommendationid": "19506051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029903975", "num_games_owned": 462, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 6844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450753615}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game. I was quickly hooked on the campaign but then I got to Tormented Space which seemed impossible. I went to the prospector zone and it had many planets that were all too easy until I ran across Molreport which again was impossible. Seems like the planets are either too easy or impossible once you finish the short campaign which ends without a word of explanation. \n\nI have only seen a small fraction of the Arc Eternal universe so I don't know if there are going to be more challenging planets. I'm beginning to think that like most games that rely on user created maps, that there is a lot of tedium. You'll have to look hard to find challenging games once you finish the short campaign. \n\nThere isn't a lot of variety in the buildings. If you zoom in close there isn't anything to see. There isn't much in the way of detailed tool tips. That's too bad because specific information could make a difference. I enjoyed terraforming my way into enemy territory but building shields is faster and less complicated. You just build millions of generators and then shield your way into the deep stuff and rip out the bad things by the roots. Bombers, straffers and guppies are there but they are rather tedious and much less effective. I didn't see people putting up lots of experience nodes to capture that might encourage you to level up your ore and AC carrying capacity in order to launch a big D day type invasion. \n\nI would highly recomend this game at the sale price especially if the professional types are going to build a longer campaign that is as delightful as their earlier campaign but this is not up there in quality like Mount and Blade or Kerbal Space Program. If their mission was to show those corporate types that they could do as good a job as any big studio, they didn't succeed.

person even if you hate video games or have never played one yet (but play creeper world 3 abraxis or the demo first so you are familiar with the machanics)\n\n\nThe actual review:\n\nStory: This game takes place 5 billion years after CR2, that's all the story for now because i don't want to spoil things.\nGameplay: Every level except for the 2 systems leading to Prospector and Tormented zone, and the system which has Farbor in it introduces new mechanics. Such as Vapen which gives you your final command node, or Arca which gives you Thor. The gameplay is mainly build weapons to fight off various enemies and advance.The enemies are runners, spores, and the creeper. In addition to this you also have digitalists which can transport creeper over terrain instead of the creeper having to flow over. Many levels will introduce a new mechanic whether it's a permament enmy, a new tech, or a custom enemy, such as Ormos which has no emmiters, but creeper stuck in space and will come down once you land. Also on Ormos you get Terps whichcan terrraform the land. The terrian is in 10 levels. 1 being the lowest and 10 the highest, the previously mentioned digitalists can ignore this boundary and can jump terrain even if the emmiter strengh is at 3 (yes in the main campgain there are emmiters that emits 3 creeper every five seconds). You paint the terrian with whatever level you want it to be and the terps will slowly work on it. This can be sped up by a powerzone. The terps reqiure energy and the area they are terraforming cannot be covered with creeper. The powerzone enhanch all of your units abilities such as being able to make terps work faster and have a longer range or turning the motor into a fast firing, long range beast. The creeper is like CR1 so nothing to say there. However, the runners must be connected to digitalis to spawn and to survive. The runners will come out of runner nests and will stun your units, the best unit to kill them are snipers. The spores are like the ones in CR1 and CR2 they must be killed by beams and will drop a payload of creeper if not destroyed. The AE fields prevent your air units (guppys, bombers, and strafers) from flying over them. Your air units are guppys, bombers, and strafers. Guppys will transport  packets to your units such as AC, energy, or ore. Bombers use AC to spray down AC on an area and are the most powerful air unit. Strafers use energy and are essentually fighters. AC is short for anti-creeper and is gained from ore which comes from ore mines which can only be played on special spots or else you would win every mission too easily. There are 2 AC units, sprayers and bombers. Sprayers will spray AC that automatically fights creeper. It works like the AC from CR2 and it will protect your units if creeper hits them meaning that reactors will be safe if ac is on them. The main units are collecters, relays, reactors, blasters, motars, and nufflifiers. Collecters, will give you some energy and will expand you energy network, place these as far away from each other as possible since the energy production doesn't stack (they collect energy from an area like the ones from CR1). Reactors can be and should be placed in tight packs since they always give .4 energy, that can upgraded in the forge or using power nodes. Blasters have to have a line of sight and fire fast. Motars don't have to have a line of sight. Nuffelers can destory emmiters. The forge can upgrade things such as packet  speed, energy effifency, or weapon range (and yes move speed does apply to guppy's).  This review is getting very long and i covered most of the things i wanted to covers so now onto bugs.\n\nIf you bugs in this game record a video, upload it to youtube, and send me the link.\n\nOh and this game has maybe 30 story levels, 30-100 alpha levels (levels that were made in the alpha) a random generator, close to a thousand user-made maps some of which allow you to play as the creeper, and 2 areas with thousands of levels which add a new mechanic in addition to the regular stuff and an extra credits mission which turns it into a third person shooter so maybe 10 or infinity hours of content for you to play until you get bored", "timestamp_created": 1448162776, "timestamp_updated": 1456692096, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19168318": {"recommendationid": "19168318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257756651", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504645050}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite RTS games of all time.

I haven't played the other games, but was able to get into the story and gameplay with no issues. You are allowed to save at any time during a mission and in my experience the early story missions take roughly a half hour and the later more complex ones can take an hour to two, so if you can only spare a little bit of time per day, this game is very accomodating.\n\nI normally enjoy RTS games for the interesting units and buildings over strategy, so I tend to spend more time building and upgrading than being any good at completing objectives. In this game, though, base building is the core. You are given the entire map to see, so you always know what is coming at you and what you need to prepare for. There are never sudden unexpected onslaughts of troops rush through your defenses. If you prefer to take your time in an RTS, this is a game that encourages it, with the exception of certain timed missions in the later story sections.\n\nThe main gameplay is set around starting a base and protecting yourself from the map-enveloping creeper and fighting it back enough that you can destroy the sources producing it. As you progress in the storyline you will be introduced slowly to new tech to help you and new threats from the creeper, such as missiles launched at you from towers. The game does a good job at teaching you how to use your new resources to deal with new problems and then challenging that new knowledge by mixing threats together. \n\nA complaint: Many, though not all, of the buildings can move themselves where you choose, which I don't believe the tutorial missions mentioned, or at least did not reinforce as well as the other gameplay mechanics. Since buildings consume energy and creeper that has reached them will damage them, it is very useful to know you can pick up and move rather than potentially kill your energy reserve with more weapons or helplessly watch a building get destroyed.\n\nPotential negatives:\nOnce you've established your base and are ready to push the creeper back, the game tends to be fairly similar each mission, especially after you've gotten all the buildings available through the story missions.\nThere is one mission per planet and typically 1-4 planets per system. When it starts getting to an hour or two per mission. It can add up to a lengthy game with less variety than you might like.", "timestamp_created": 1447692386, "timestamp_updated": 1447717888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19050155": {"recommendationid": "19050155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129917523", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 2290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495883810}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u9663\u53d6\u308a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\u30bf\u30ef\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30d5\u30a7\u30f3\u30b9\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306a\uff32\uff34\uff33\n\n\u6db2\u4f53\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u6e67\u304d\u51fa\u3066\u304f\u308b\u6575\u306e\u62e0\u70b9\u3092\u6f70\u3059\u3068\u52dd\u3061\n\u30ea\u30bd\u30fc\u30b9\u306f\u96fb\u529b\u3068\u7279\u6b8a\u306a\u5f3e\u3060\u3051\u3001\u96fb\u529b\u304c\u8a31\u3059\u9650\u308a\u30ac\u30f3\u30ac\u30f3\u5efa\u3066\u3089\u308c\u308b\n\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306f\u7121\u3057\u3001\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u4f1a\u8a71\u306f\u5206\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044\u304c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u3084\u7269\u306e\u4f7f\u3044\u65b9\u306f\u624b\u306b\u5165\u3063\u305f\u9806\u306b\u3044\u3058\u3063\u3066\u308c\u3070\u3060\u3044\u305f\u3044\u308f\u304b\u308b\n\u5206\u304b\u308a\u305a\u3089\u3044\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u306f\u30de\u30fc\u30af\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3092\u5730\u5f62\u6539\u5909\u3067\u6398\u3063\u3066\u3042\u3052\u308c\u3070\u3044\u3044\n\n\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u306f\u5236\u9650\u6642\u9593\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3082\u3042\u308b\u306e\u3067\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u578b\u306e\u4eba\u306f\u6ce8\u610f\n\u53ce\u9332\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u304c\u591a\u304f\u3001\u30a8\u30c7\u30a3\u30c3\u30c8\u3082\u3042\u308b\u306e\u3067\u304b\u306a\u308a\u306e\u30dc\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30e0", "timestamp_created": 1447417884, "timestamp_updated": 1447417884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19045472": {"recommendationid": "19045472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064238438", "num_games_owned": 646, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "last_played": 1516131981}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a fantastic game with tower defense and RTS elements that rival the best ever.

And boy was I glad I bought it, becoming one of my more quick favorites, moving up the list of a steam game I've purchased and actually played, beyond the title screen that is.  It's fast paced, with a pause button, and simple in terms of building order and/or layouts, but complex in the ways you can go about beating one level to the next.  It has a lot of advanced features, that aren't really necessary to win, but awesome when you figure out ways to utilize them (turning off building re-supply or disarming buildings temporarily).  The only downside I've found with this game so far, is that it's kind of challenging in a linear sort of way, meaning if you don't know what you are doing the first time a new building is introduced you can find yourself suddenly losing after playing a level for 30 minutes, which kinda sucks.  If you aren't sure of the buildings function or influence on the given level you sort of have to resort to trial and error a few times to figure out how to win.  However, that is the only flaw I have with the game so far, and it's a small one at that, as it is fun, challenging without being stupidly hard, and after a few times playing the visual style turns out to be perfectly fine.

But that does not change your strategy, it just adds a tiny mix of certain type of gun to the \"build mortars and win\".\nThe only mission i actually had to adjust over time was the last mission of the main story AGAINST Loki. But even then it was just a bigger mix in overwelmingly prevaling \"mortar combat\".\n\nSo after a certain time the game becomes dull and the only challenge are map conditions where you are forced to do something before you can \"mortar them all\".\nIt is a shame, really. The overall concept is very nice.\n\n\n---- SPOILER ALERT ----\n[spoiler]\nAnd i was able to win last mission as Emperor doing this:\nMove around not to get hit and destroy the right lower AA gun.\nPlace the ship outside the range of other guns.\nSet time to 4x (only needed to make things quicker.\nPress the mouse button that fires the gun (and leave it pressed whichever way you like), so the creep is constantly renewed below the gunshots.\n8Hrs later (2Hrs on 4x speed) - victory, the map was  completely flooded by the creep :)\n\nThe only thing interesting about it was to see how the creep and anticreep collide and how the \"fluid physics\" works in game.\n[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1446363175, "timestamp_updated": 1446363175, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523573", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18808092": {"recommendationid": "18808092", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981405537", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498956758}, "language": "english", "review": "Ignore the play time reported by Steam... I bought this game direct from the developer's website and played it for quite a while before activating it on Steam.  Plus, if you consider the first two games and the free versions on Kongregate, I've easily logged a hundred hours or more in the whole series.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of tower defense or RTS, but this game combines the two genres in a way that is incredibly fun.  The basic plot is that a \"grey-goo\" type of substance, called the Creeper, has taken over the galaxy, and it's up to you to fight back.  You plop down a Command Node, build a few Collectors to generate energy, and try to keep from being overwhelmed until you can build up enough to go on the offensive.  However, there is enough variation in the game mechanics that each map presents a new challenge and a new puzzle to solve.\n\nThere is one map (anyone who's played the game long enough will know the one I'm talking about) that really ruins the fun and actually put me off the game for a long while.  Unlike the others where you can take your time and develop whatever strategy you want, this one is a timed mission and a pretty tough one at that.

Basically, you're fighting a liquid. This liquid flows from higher elevation to lower elevation (like liquid does). There are emitters that pour this liquid out of them at specific intervals. You have several ways of corraling and destroying this liquid. Destroying thin liquid with laser turrets, deep liquid with mortars, or distant liquid with strafers. Corraling liquid with terraformers to lower or highten the terrain or shields that shove the liquid around. Or, even combinations of the two with anti-liquid that doesn't damage your towers and can destroy the bad liquid.\n\nThere are several play-modes too. \n\nThe campaign starts you off with very little unlocked and very easy missions. As it progresses, you unlock more turrets, learning what each does with the missions getting harder and harder. Eventually, you have nearly everything and the missions have reached alarming difficulty, requiring epic strategy to beat, making each mission defeated a great accomplishment and very satisfying.\n\nColonial Space has a huge array of player created maps given ratings for each one with varying difficulties and extreme customization for each level.\n\nAlpha Sector is filled with misisons created by alpha testers of the game.\n\nTormented Space and Prospector Zone have maps randomly generated by the engine.\n\nThis game is all about strategy, and nothing to do with luck. Love it.\n\nI may be a little biased though, I've followed this series of games since the first. Creeper World was unique and amazing. Creeper World 2 was... okay, he took some aspects of the first one and made a different type of game that wasn't as well balanced nor built.

If you liked it before, you'll love this.\n\nIf not, then you're also in for a treat! CW is very, very good. People compare it to tower defence, but I usually describe it as a computer network fighting a liquid. The lines you see in the screenshots are the links between your units - if a unit becomes disconnected, it won't get resupplied and will eventually become defenceless. So, keeping supply lines going is incredibly important. The other thing is that your primary enemy is a corrosive purple liquid - it has no AI whatsoever, it just flows following the terrain. (Or sometimes it moves in other ways - the more scripted maps can have it behave in stranger ways.) The third thing is that terrain is everything. Perhaps the best defence in this game is just a really high wall... until the creeper overflows it!\n\nThis is a game about attacking, not defending however. Pushing forwards, often uphill, can be very tricky because most of your units can't attack upwards, and the creeper naturally flows down on top of you. Then you have to handle beach landings, and spore towers that will dump creeper right in your base, and runners that stun your units, and then all of these at the same time, uphill, with a time limit, along with all kinds of one-off scripted challenges too!\n\nLater in the campaign you'll unlock units that can modify the terrain (slowly) and let you build a series of stepping stones above the creeper, or build walls to protect your home, or produce helpful \"anti-creeper\", or send supply ships to bridge between islands, or try to push the creeper away with force fields, or all sorts of other cool things. The fact that it's so freeform lets you find a style that's comfortable. I'm a big fan of terrain fiddling myself.\n\nSeriously, this game has so many original ideas, and it's executed really well. Perhaps not the prettiest of games, but it's very clever, and it'll make [i]you[/i] feel clever when you finally conquer a map that's taken you hours.

There's also a few new toys to play with, like ways to generate your own \"anti-creeper,\" ways to terraform the terrain, and even ways to fly energy packets to remote areas that are not connected to your network. The creeper also has a few new tricks including \"digitalis\" which spreads faster and is harder to destroy but is limited to pre-defined paths, and \"runners\" which are little mobs that can temporarily disable your structures. \n\nI could knock the game for not being more innovative, but I liked CW1 enough that I thoroughly enjoyed having a similar experience again.", "timestamp_created": 1439301362, "timestamp_updated": 1439301362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17481995": {"recommendationid": "17481995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210303805", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 363, "last_played": 1516336599}, "language": "english", "review": "Why can't the big companies make games like this?", "timestamp_created": 1439260250, "timestamp_updated": 1439260250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17464580": {"recommendationid": "17464580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091805269", "num_games_owned": 834, "num_reviews": 127, "playtime_forever": 3143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454257785}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome!!

Got my money's worth but not much more than that.\n\nOne of the more innovative takes on the tower defense genre, but not without its flaws. \n\nThere are no waves, just the relentless Creeper that keeps flooding the levels at a more or less steady rate. Meanwhile, the player builds all manner of defenses and the infrastructure to support it. It becomes a tug-of-ware between how much creeper is created and the player's ability to destroy it. Due to this mechanic, the hard part is usually the beginning, the containment of the creeper. Once that's done, the player would begin building more and more weapons to turn the tide in his favor. It gets a bit redundant, but luckily the devs have spiced things up a little with creative level design.\n\nBut that's just one way of playing the game. The other is to rush everything in minutes and ignore most of the depth the game has to offer. The worst part is that the tactic for rushing is pretty much always the same.\n\nHaving spent hours defeating single levels with the first method, I feel kind of cheated. I like the base building aspect in games, because it's rewarding to see the tide turn in your favor.

With all the user-created maps, and extra map packs the game provides, I am already returning for more challenges.\n\nA criticism I'm reading in the negative reviews is how the game is the same grind all over again. Building up basic macro and defenses, and then progressing with micro as you upgrade your tech. For a game where every map is different, leaving a wide array of viable strategies and tactics to the player, I find this a very bad point. The SupCom-esque resource system, the focus on map control and relentless assault make this game very interesting, and even the initial 'always repeated' steps come in a personal flavor and depend on the map. \n\nThe graphics may look abstract and weird in the screenshots, but they quickly make sense when playing the game. The terrain layers are also very consistent. And honestly, I found a salvo of Bertha shots' dispersed Creeper very satisfying to watch.

Taking a genre that has seen little inovation in recent years and turning it on its head. Expect a fun and challenging game, with an interesting story and a truly staggering amount of dev and user created levels. If you want a new challenge in a game type you like, then this RTS is well worth a try.\n\nA slightly more detailed opinion on the game is as follows.\n\nCreeper World 3 may be the third in a series but this is the first I heard of it. I enjoyed this game so much i really want to play the other two. The gameplay is fresh and an easy to follow inovation of traditional RTS's. With a story mode that doubles as a tutorial, new tech is introduced at a steady and not overwhelmin pace, but not too slow either. Instead of mining traditional resources you mine energy(for the most part) which maily takes space, the more space you have the more possible energy you can get, using traditional looking turrets and air craft you have to defend against an insidious liquid like enemy that flows from a central point, trying to take over the level. From a gameplay perspective this game is well worth a go if your a strategy fan, and if you simply want a game that provides a challenge without being overly frustrating then this may well be a good game for you.\n\nThere are many features that will draw people from a leadership board, to simple but not old looking graphics, a different take on the RTS genre and of course the obscene amount of levels created by Devs and Users.\n\nOn the probems side of this game, there are very few, there is one level that universaly hated for being bery hard and in many people's opinion impossible, this of course is wrong, its simply very hard. The repetative nature of so many guns constantly firing is very frustrating but they have made it easy to mute the sound. \n\nI certainly recomend this game as its deffinatly made it into my top favourate strategy games, and has just made it into my favourate games of all time.

It also gets called a Tower Defense game a lot, which does the unique strategic components a horrible injustice. Instead, Arc Eternal is a laid-back thinking mans' RTS with unprecedented play-more value and excels as a game you can sink some time into in the form of a well thought out and strictly controlled approach, or as a casual attack on a map every now and then. It's like Civilization V in the respect that you'll launch it for a quick 20 minute game and find yourself embroiled in the relentless depths of an alien planet fighting to make a foothold on a section of map on the 4th planet of your 3rd star system 6 hours later, wondering where the time went.\n\nThe amount of content in here is staggering, and the campaign provides such a good learning curve and introduction to the new structures and some possible strategies that can't be praised enough. There's also an engaging backstory in the main campaigns which help you feel isolated and alone while fighting the uncaring, unforgiving creep, and while the dialogue is cliche at times, it helps bolster the already engaging gameplay and add a little depth.\n\n[h1]Highlights[/h1]\n\nThe best part of this game is simply the gameplay. While the tower defense mechanics have been done to death and don't offer anything particularly insightful, the different natures of the two opposing forces here make for a level of adaptable strategy that you wont see in many games. The structures are all balanced and simple but effective additions like Terraforming and one-use items make for even more ways to play and even more things to spend time working on.\n\nThe sheer amount of content is the other great part of this world, and deserves praise.\n\n* The first port of call is the Arc Eternal which acts as the campaign mode and teaches the player the basics and structures, and consists of 9 star systems for a total of approximately 50 levels.\n* There's the Alpha Sector which includes many early maps and a ton made by the alpha and beta players.\n* The Prospectors Zone features procedurally generated maps.\n* There's Tormented Space for those seeking challenge which includes maps from hard to literally impossible.\n* The Dial Map Device acts as a map generation tool and lets you play more specific maps.\n\n[h1]Mistakes & Annoyances[/h1]\n\nFor many, the simple enemy A.I. is an issue here, and it can be argued that the very flat nature of the enemy intelligence makes for a somewhat bland approach. I'd counterargue and say that this game is more about finding solutions you like, and/or finding the optimal or most efficient route to victory and that the focus doesn't need to be on the creep.\n\n* The difficulty curve isn't very smooth, and you can find yourself struggling way beyond what you'd expect in some of the later campaign missions, or struggling to overcome frustrating maps. There are also several outright impossible missions which nobody has yet been able to find a solution to.\n\n[h1]Recommendations[/h1]\n\nArc Eternal comes priced at \u00a310.99/14.99\u20ac/$14.99 and while it contains a huge amount of play time, including a main story of at least 15 hours, it's still probably slightly overpriced for most players when compared against competitors. It's one of those games which you'll either love or hate, and so playing the demos listed below, or the flash versions of the developers other titles before making a full priced purchase is recommended.\n\n* If the huge amount of content included by default wasn't enough for you, there are a ton of user maps too with different types of play. There are [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=466266597]even [i]Play as Creeper[/i] style maps[/url].\n* Some of the earlier titles are also [url=http://www.kongregate.com/search?q=creeper+world]available for free play in Flash on Kongregate[/url].\n* There are demos of all 3 of the Creeper World games available on KnuckleCrackers' website which are much shorter.\n\n[table][tr][th][url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/]More Reviews Like This[/url] [/th][th] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/GHGems]Underrated & Hidden Games on Steam[/url] [/th][/tr][/table]", "timestamp_created": 1437495366, "timestamp_updated": 1459337087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 167, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.919202", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17153514": {"recommendationid": "17153514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032137848", "num_games_owned": 1300, "num_reviews": 443, "playtime_forever": 583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438591823}, "language": "english", "review": "Just an awesome unique little tower defense type game.

All buldings need to be connected to a resource network and many of the buildings can be moved in a way similar to the Terran buildings in StarCraft. \n\nThe main enemy is the creeper, which is a fluid flowing out of emitters.\nThis fluid will flow downhill which is usually towards you. \nYou cannot build in creeper and it destroys your buildings if it touches them.\nThe maps have 10 height levels and you can build terraformers to change the terrain gradually. This gives you tons of tactical options. The simplest example would be to build yourself a high wall as protection against the creeper. \nBeware that creeper levels accumulate and if you do not destroy some, it will flow over your precious walls.\nYou have various guns and mortars in your arsenal to destroy the creeper and you can even deploy your own anti-creeper, but this is just pushing back against the endless flow. \nTo stop new creeper from forming, you need to push towards the emitter and build a special building, the nullifier, and protect it until it powers up enough to destroy the emitter.\n\nThere are other interesting foes and obstacles, which I will not spoil here. \nThe bread and butter of the enemy is the creeper emitter. \n\nMost of the tension for me was usually in the early game, where I needed to stave off the creeper while building my resource economy and it's often about eeking out tiny little advantages until I could stably match the creeper. After that, the aggressive phase starts. \n\nThere are dozens of interesting story missions with diverse leveldesigns where you need different strategies to win.\n\nAfter beating the story missions, which took me about 30 hours!, you have a sheer endless supply of challenge maps, as well as tons of user generated maps. \n\nThough I find that the challenge maps aren't as diverse as the story maps, so once you find your dominant strategy, they tend to play out similarly. \n\nCreeper World 3 is also an excellent podcast game, since all relevant information is presented visually.\n\nThe game gets a clear purchase recommendation from me.\nYou can play the demo version beforehand, you can find that on the developer's website.\n\nCreeper World 3 has a crazy high rating of 97% on Steam, which I think is because the Trailer shows you exactly what you can expect from the game.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1436737765, "timestamp_updated": 1436737765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17005523": {"recommendationid": "17005523", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964636724", "num_games_owned": 531, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436654065}, "language": "english", "review": "A really solid tower defense vs semi-predictable enemy creep generation makes for a lot of interesting strategies.

Mais y a des mecs obstin\u00e9s parfois : malgr\u00e9 l'absence totale de visibilit\u00e9 le d\u00e9veloppeur a, au fur et \u00e0 mesure des \u00e9pisodes, peaufin\u00e9 le concept de son jeu, pour au final sortir son troisi\u00e8me opus sur la plate-forme du gros (mais v\u00e9n\u00e9rable) Gabe Newell.[/b]\n\n\n[h1]Cris et peurs (sur la ville).[/h1]\n\nM\u00e9lange improbable entre STR et Tower Defense avec un fort accent pour le scoring, CW3 est un jeu plus complexe et int\u00e9ressant qu'il en a l'air. Alors, bien s\u00fbr, graphiquement \u00e7a ne casse pas vraiment des briques, ni des parpaings, mais tout s'av\u00e8re extr\u00eamement lisible et c'est justement ce qui est important dans ce jeu.\n\nPour comprendre le principe du jeu, on va faire simple : le creeper est une sorte de fluide qui se r\u00e9pand \u00e9ternellement, de fa\u00e7on continue et r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. C'est l'ennemi \u00e9ternel \u00e0 stopper. Ce fluide, mortel pour toutes vos installations, doit \u00eatre stopp\u00e9 \u00e0 l'aide de diff\u00e9rents moyens. Que \u00e7a soit par des armes conventionnelles, qui d\u00e9truisent le liquide qui approcherait de la ligne de mire de vos d\u00e9fenses, ou d'un module permettant de terraformer le terrain. En effet le terrain est en 3D et il est divis\u00e9 en 10 couches superpos\u00e9es. Vous pouvez donc faire varier la hauteur du terrain pour stopper, du moins provisoirement, la progression du creeper. Vous pouvez vous barricader derri\u00e8re des murs ou construire d'\u00e9normes fosses pour contenir le creeper. Mais sachez que cela est vain, le creeper continuera d'envoyer son liquide jusqu'\u00e0 submerger vos d\u00e9fenses.\nPour vaincre celui-ci, vous devrez vous frayer un chemin jusqu'\u00e0 ses \u00e9metteurs et les d\u00e9truire, ces constructions sont responsables de l'\u00e9mission du liquide.\n\nToute la force strat\u00e9gique de SW3 r\u00e9side dans l'\u00e9tablissement d'une strat\u00e9gie de d\u00e9fense efficace, qui permettra de stopper la progression du creeper. C'est l\u00e0 tout l'aspect int\u00e9ressant du titre. Le but est d'\u00e9quilibrer la balance entre les deux forces respectives. Comme le fluide ne fait que fondre sur votre base de mani\u00e8re continue, si vous r\u00e9ussissez \u00e0 le stopper, alors il sera ensuite possible de progresser, petit \u00e0 petit, en r\u00e9cup\u00e9rant chaque m\u00e8tre carr\u00e9 de terrain, pour au final d\u00e9truire les \u00e9metteurs.\n\nLe jeu se compose donc en deux phases majeures : la d\u00e9fense qui permettra de stabiliser le front puis l'attaque, qui doit \u00eatre le plus rapide possible. En effet, le jeu int\u00e8gre une partie de scoring importante, qui n\u00e9cessite de rusher le plus vite possible. C'est celui qui fait le meilleur temps qui obtient la place privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e du TOP 250 des meilleurs joueurs. Et je peux vous dire que ce n'est pas facile, vu la horde de fous furieux qui s'accrochent au high score.\n\n\n[h1]Une optimisation au poil.[/h1]\n\nLe jeu comporte des m\u00e9caniques finalement assez complexes, avec une gestion importante de l'\u00e9nergie en flux tendu. Par cons\u00e9quent, le but sera de g\u00e9rer efficacement l'\u00e9nergie : ne pas avoir de surplus, qui signifierait que votre strat\u00e9gie n'est pas optimale et qu'il est possible d'optimiser votre conqu\u00eate, mais pas non plus de p\u00e9nurie, qui peut signifier bien souvent la mort pure et simple. Par ailleurs, le manque d'\u00e9nergie provoque une baisse de l'approvisionnement en munition et en vitesse de construction des diff\u00e9rents modules. Des tourelles qui tirent moins vite ne stopperont pas efficacement le creeper, qui envahira lentement, mais irr\u00e9sistiblement, votre base.\n\nLa difficult\u00e9 r\u00e9side donc dans le fait de produire cette \u00e9nergie, qui requiert des g\u00e9n\u00e9rateurs qui exploitent une zone donn\u00e9e. Vous pouvez donc soit vous retrouver dans un cercle vertueux, soir un cercle vicieux. Je m'explique : dans le cas o\u00f9 vous ne produisez pas assez d'\u00e9nergie et que le creeper gagne du terrain, la mort est quasi certaine puisque vous n'aurez pas la possibilit\u00e9 de produire assez d'\u00e9nergie pour vous d\u00e9fendre. Dans le cas inverse o\u00f9 vous prenez petit \u00e0 petit du terrain au creeper, vous aurez plus de zones pour produire de l'\u00e9nergie, et donc la possibilit\u00e9 de construire des armes suppl\u00e9mentaires pour exterminer le liquide. Toute la difficult\u00e9 sera alors de trouver le moyen d'obtenir une d\u00e9fense stable puis de contre-attaquer.\n\nComme le jeu pousse le joueur \u00e0 rusher, il ne faudra ni \u00eatre trop gourmand sur la conqu\u00eate du territoire, ni \u00eatre trop lent. Cela dit, la prudence est importante, mais la t\u00e9m\u00e9rit\u00e9 est bien plus gratifiante.\n\nLe gros d\u00e9faut du titre r\u00e9side en fait dans la seconde phase du jeu. Une fois qu'on a \u00e9tabli une strat\u00e9gie pour faire face au creeper, il ne reste plus qu'\u00e0 l'attaquer, et celui-ci n'a gu\u00e8re de moyen de se d\u00e9fendre (il poss\u00e8de cependant d'autres modules, comme les spores, sortent d'ast\u00e9ro\u00efdes qu'il vous envoie p\u00e9riodiquement pour s'\u00e9craser sur vos installations, ou encore des robots qui d\u00e9sactivent temporairement vos modules). C'est donc une phase d'optimisation quasi math\u00e9matiques qui s'ouvre, dont le but est d'obtenir la victoire le plus rapidement possible. Cette seconde phase est, selon moi, moins int\u00e9ressante.\n\nAu final, la difficult\u00e9 du titre est tr\u00e8s variable. La campagne n'est pas difficile \u00e0 terminer une fois les m\u00e9caniques du jeu comprises. Mais c'est bien plus compliqu\u00e9 d'obtenir le meilleur score possible et cela requiert une planification m\u00e9thodique avec, en amont, tout un travail d'optimisation th\u00e9orique de la d\u00e9fense puis de l'attaque.\nEn revanche, une fois la campagne termin\u00e9e, le jeu s'ouvre \u00e0 d'autres modes de jeux, dont le \u00ab tormented space \u00bb, une galaxie gigantesque (des centaines de syst\u00e8mes solaires contenant jusqu'\u00e0 14 plan\u00e8tes, donc niveau dur\u00e9e de vie vous en aurez pour l'\u00e9ternit\u00e9) aux niveaux parfois extr\u00eamement durs qui ne pardonnent aucune erreur de votre part.\n\nAjoutez \u00e0 cela une cr\u00e9ation proc\u00e9durale des cartes (en dehors des maps faites avec les mimines du d\u00e9veloppeur) permettant d'avoir des niveaux infinis ainsi qu'un \u00e9diteur de carte tr\u00e8s complet et une gestion rapide et efficace pour envoyer et t\u00e9l\u00e9charger les cartes d'autres joueurs. Ce qui nous donne au total un jeu au prix modique, mais \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e de vie gigantesque.\n\n\n[h1]Un gameplay novateur et efficace ?

Unlike most tower defense games your enemy isn't a horde of monsters, but is instead a steadily expanding mass known as 'creeper'. Defeating the creeper isn't as simple as having strong towers - you have to know how to hold back the creeper while expanding your own area of influence, taking into account the the creeper will ooze in from multiple angles and will build up in areas of low elevation to eventually climb up onto higher ground. \n\nYour own building mechanics are quite interesting as well. Instead of having independent towers, you instead build a web-like network of resource gatherers, utility structures, and attacking towers. Managing this web can get quite tricky at times, because all resources must flow through a command center and take time to traverse the network. Done incorrectly you could end up building a tower but not being able to arm it in time to defend against the creeper. \n\nAlso, while the creeper acts as a steadily growing mass, the player often ends up mirroring the creeper in many ways. Collectors - the primary resource generator - are most effective when spread out, forcing the player to expand their area of influence if they want more resources to spend. There are also many resource deposits around the map which must be contested, forcing the player to expand their area of influence even more. Aiding this playstyle is the fact that attacking towers can be respositioned, allowing you to leapfrog towers to slowly but steadily push the creeper back.\n\nOverall the game is an excellent example of a unique twist on a genre and very polished gameplay. It's an extremely satisfying game to play and I highly recommend it to anyone who finds the concept interesting. Don't worry about not playing the previous games - they give more of the story, but this game is fully functional as a standalone experience.", "timestamp_created": 1435221318, "timestamp_updated": 1435221318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16686617": {"recommendationid": "16686617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110702009", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435172521}, "language": "english", "review": "I tried it - you've got some stuff that generates energy and some stuff that stops the creeping whatever - water? - and you have to plonk them down on the map so that they're a) all joined up to ensure your useful stuff has enough energy, b) close enough to do something, and c) far enough away from the water to be working before they get submerged.\n\nI didn't like it.

I'm so badass! I could lift ten times my weight before breakfast!\" Well, time for a wake-up call, sweetheart. With this simple, yet surprisingly hard to master little gem, you'll be doing war against the Creeper, an ever evolving, ever growing purple monstrosity, like the Smooze if it was genocidal and emotionless. You'll be taken back by how much strategy you have to implement to wage your war against the creeper. See, unlike your average RTS/tower defense, you can't just rush guys in and tire the enemy out. No, he'll be doing that to you. You have to cleverly work a way around using a multitude of offensive and defensive technologies. Standards like shields which protect you from the ever-increasing reach of the Creeper, to aerial units which provide ground support, and a landing pad for you to stage a beachhead against the amorphous beast. If you think you're Mr. Bigshot after hearing that, then prove it. Beat the creeper and send him to the reaper!\n\nWith that all said and done, I fully recommend this game. Especially when it took me about 15 hours to complete my first playthrough. I have to say that's not bad at all. And looking back, i even had tons of replay value checking out the other game modes, such as custom maps made by the developers, and those made by the community.

It takes the gameplay of the original, and builds on it; interestingly, it gives you all of your old toys pretty quickly. The anti-creeper from the sequel makes a return, and works quite well. The level design was decent, although there were times when I felt it could've used work, and I rarely found it necessary to use more than one control node, with the exception of the timed missions.\n\nThe story was the weakest part, having reduced the cast to just two members: Abraxis and his ship's AI. There's some good world building, but I think it could've been greatly expanded upon, and the twist ending was really unexpected, and felt out of place. I'm not fond of stories that retcon their own history. If you want a great story, I'd recommend playing the original, which is still the best in this regard.\n\nI was honestly hoping for a longer experience overall, but there is replay value in the form of custom community maps (still haven't tried it yet), as well as a random map generator which need to be unlocked through the campaign. Something I'd love to see is a massive map, spanning several screens in size, with complex terrain and hidden secrets buried around the map; the only time you excavate anything in game is during the last level.\n\nOn the whole, fans of the genre will enjoy this, just don't expect any literary awards. 8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1434669611, "timestamp_updated": 1434669611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16510273": {"recommendationid": "16510273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031550982", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511454631}, "language": "english", "review": "Havent been so positevely surprised with a game for a loooong time!

The game has a long chain of \"tutorial\" missions (not a handholder, the missions are actually fun) Once you get into the game itself, things start getting interesting, and you really start strugglin with the choices you have, power management becomes a real issue, air raids become a fear, and the tides keep rising, ever flowing, overflowing!!! \n\nJust play the game guys, if you are not sure, look for the flash games of creeper world, if you like tower defense in general, this will revolutionize your perspective.", "timestamp_created": 1434571296, "timestamp_updated": 1434571296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.997145", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16480164": {"recommendationid": "16480164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051466813", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434728845}, "language": "english", "review": "Interestingly even if creeper world opened a semi-new genre and  it never got copied.. so this is a somewhat unique game.

Cannons, mortars, sprayers, and other tools are at your disposal. Interestingly, you are able to reposition them as the situation on the ground changes.

You are fighting against a rising liquid tide and have to plug your defenses then expand outward.  Has a simple yet effective art style that conveys all the information you need.  Playstyle is reminiscent of tower defense but more immediate, at the same time levels can often feel like a puzzle.  This combination means finishing a level is usually very satisfying.  The game does an excellent job of gradually introducing the mechanics and units and the levels where they are introduced do a good job of teaching you how to use them effectively without holding your hand.  The creep behaves intuitively leading to emergent strategies that the game never outright tells you about but make perfect sense, particularly as regards the terraforiming.  You can make walls and trenches to control the flow of the creep, or push back an area then build walls around it to expand into a large pool.  So far the levels have been varied enough that each new level has made me think 'ah interesting, how am I going to deal with this?'  \n\n  About the only negative I've found is that the sound design.  Weapon sound effects can be very repetitive, especially when you are in the late stages of a level and have many mortars and strafers firing at once.

I've played CW2 before, so I didn't hesitate to buy this game as soon as I've noticed it.\n\nWhat is CW all about? It's an interesting strategy, where you don't fight against enemy units similar to yours, but massive amounts of creeping blue goo. So it feels a little bit like tower defence, but really innovative one.\n\nThe in-game economy system is quite simmilar to one from Supreme Commander (which I loved too!) and it's based more on flow of the resources than stockpiling them. This approach forces costant action, which is nice.\n\nSo, does concept still feels to You boring? Fear not, as so far every single map is quite diverse and suprises me with something new (I've completed about 30% of game, and CW2 which was quite brilliant too!). Your enemy sometimes spawns various units too, and the goo doesn't always act like it's expected to. \n\nThe game has its own plot, which is not that plain. There are no cosmic civilisations fighting against each other. There's no war, humanity lost against creeper long ago. You've been asleep for 5 billion years. All you can do is crawling through ruins of ceased race of humans, and try to make sense of what happened. Why do I even mention history in such simple game? Honestly, because at this point I am simply curious how will this story end.\n\nThe only 2 downsides I've noticed are:\n-crappy, plain graphics. I don't think it matters though, as this simpleness comes in one package with perfect gameplay and practical interface.\n-lack of multiplayer. Seriously, guys, I don't care, add it somehow!\n\nWhat do I say at the end? Mabye I'll describe my general feel about it.

Regardless I\u2019ve been enjoying the hell out of the game\n\nLastly, i would love to see more types of items to defend with, aside from using the anticreeper goo turrets and the jets, i found the game mostly revolved around the standard turrets and mortars, with some specialty units thrown in that are only situational, they're fun but more variation would be nice. Also the block building thing is overpowered as hell, really needs some sorta finite resorce to stop you from just cheezing it and building a 10 high bridge all the way to the spawners, i'd like to see it cost more or be limited somehow because it makes defending way too easy, maybe combine it with the ore production so it costs a bit more, I\u2019m a bit of a turtle style builder but this gives you way too much control. \n\nBut yeah buy this game!!\n", "timestamp_created": 1434211424, "timestamp_updated": 1434211424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16359540": {"recommendationid": "16359540", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982380315", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435499996}, "language": "english", "review": "Might be my favorite tower defense game.

The spawner acts as well for the liquid goo that is starting to slowly spread from its origin and you are tasked with destroying the spawner.\n\nIn order to destroy the spawner you have to build an infrastructure that can fuel and provide your military forces (Towers) the necessary energy to stem the tide of the goo. You start from your own base/spaceship and extend from there, building collectors and relay stations in order to gather and transport energy to the guns. The guns once build have to be provided with energy in order to shoot. If the goo touches the base of the installation, the installation gets destroyed.\n\nAs mentioned before, you are fighting on a tophographic map, which means every map has several layers and you can for example use the high advantage of a plateau in order to attack the goo beneath it. The goo, behaving like a liquid has to fill the entire level, before it can advance in height, which can be used by the player via terraforming the level.\n\nA quite addicting little game.

(Yes, I know there are other enemy-types besides the two mentioned above, but none that show up mid-game or late-game, to create dynamic havoc in your carefully laid plans.)\n\nThere IS the concept of pre-existing barriers that corrode, giving a timed threat-release, but these are rarely employed to anything like the full potential of providing a mid-game threat. Even if they did, there is nothing that provides a late-game threat or reversal of fortunes, no increasing flood of more powerful foes, etc. There is no ramping up of the initial threat which might turn the tide if you don't deploy for it. Really, the only way to lose a game at the mid-point or toward the end is user error, like uncovering a flank with anti-missle defenses and having an attack get through to the rear. Even then, if it doesn't cut off significant supply lines, which can easily be made redundant, then the front-line may not be affected at all by the misfortune.\n\nBut then... you can download fiendish levels that are user-made to solve that problem to a degree.\n\n8/10 (or relatively speaking, as fun and playable as any game in the Tower Defense genre available on Steam, if not more-so)", "timestamp_created": 1429487204, "timestamp_updated": 1429488337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15452415": {"recommendationid": "15452415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167073924", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 12530, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445834615}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game to play for casual gamer/noob.

It was pretty good, having had it about a month after it was released on the Knucklecraker site, it was later released on Steam, and due to the Developer beign a really awesome person, Virgil allowed all previous owners of the game, to get a free steam key, since they'd already bought the game.\n\nSo okay, I'm keepnig this one short.\n\nThe game is basically a Tower Defense/Real-Time Strategy hybrid, where the enemy is not identical to you in any possible form. Your enemy is (as the store page itself says) a fluid-like substance that flows over the transformable terrain. This substance acts exactly like water, only if it touches your stuff, it either outright destroys it immediately (non weapon/titan units) or it slowly melts away at it (Weapons and titans).\nThe substance flows from emitters, which you need to fight towards, and destroy them using Nullifiers, doing this as you go from world to world, saving them all from the Blue Tide named Creeper.\n\nPros:\n- The Story is well-written honestly, keeping you guessing, even after you've beaten the story.\n- Unlike previous entries, you can use Titans, which are like superweapons, and they are awesome!\n- Also unlike previous entires, there are three endings insted of only one.\n- Each Story mission has many ways of beating it, there are those \"Per map strategy that always wins\" but no single strategy will get you a victory on every map.\n- The Environment actually means something in the game, allowing you to create fortresses for defense using terraforming, or for offense to get an easier shot at something, or even boxing in an emmitter.\n- The Soundtrack is by far the best I've ever fonud in the game. It perfectly fits the game's underlying post-apocalyptic setting set in the far future.\n- There are no bugs that are atleast in-game. It's never crashed, it's never frozen without external conflicts, it doesn't even have glitches.\n- You can make the Creeper any color if blue doesn't work. Red, Black, White, Purple... if it exists as a color, you can do it pretty much. Also works for anti-creeper too.\n- Literally thousands of levels to play after the story, with levels made by testers and part of the dev team like MadMag, the artist behind the game, or Virgil, all made with the game's own random map generator, the DMD, Dial Map Device.\n- Has the most impossible level ever put on a strategy game, Jovincoting, a map so hard, absolutely nobody has ever beaten it. This game has technically been out for about a couple years now. Or almost.\n- Strategy mostly consists of neat tricks you pick up along the way than actual builds as following a build will slow you down in almost every possible case, due to how maps are all different.\n- The Game has a map editor with it's own scripting language, using it can allow you to change the game form what it is, to a top down shooter (Credits mission), or even a game where you play as the creeper against AI-controlled enemy command nodes.\n\nCons\n- The map selection music will often content ID youtube videos showing it.\n- I literally cannot think of anymore Cons. I've been trying to for the last two days.\n\nAll of this and even more is only 17 dollars CDN, probly 15 US. Just get it, this game is basically one of the best, most underappreciated titles on the market today.

The main difference here though, is the enemy. Instead of tanks, humans or monsters, you have a lava like liquid, that slowly creeps its way to your base and tries to 'fill' the entire map.\n\nIt's called 'The Creeper'. I know, it sounds like the name of a cheap 60s horror movie, but it's not.\n\nAnyways, most of the time you'll build turrets, mortars, jet fighters and bombers to defend yourself from The Creeper. But usually that's not enough. You also have the option to 'terraform' the environment. That way you can either dig trenches, or, which is a lot more effective, raise the terrain to wall off your base.\n\nThe whole process is quite a lot of fun, especially when you unlock things like the Bertha, which is a giant cannon, or the Thor, which is a giant spaceship with multiple turrets that rains death from above.\n\nThe thing I like the most about Creeper World 3 is that you can play whatever way you like. This might be the slow and defensive way, or the fast and offensive way. This is quite important if you care about getting in the top 10 list of each map. These lists are primarily sorted by how much time it took you to complete the map, though to be honest, you'll have a hard time beating the best times, since they're usually around 20 to 30 seconds for each map. This is especially frustrating because I doubt those times are legit most of the time.\n\nAll in all though, Creeper World 3 features a huge amount of content, which is good if you like getting your money worth. It's also bad if you want to 100% this game, because judging by the amount of levels, it might take you hundreds of hours to do so.\n\nThere's also the fact that you can make your own maps, and play other players maps right inside the game. This gives Creper World 3 almost infinitive content, though some player created levels might be too easy, or even impossible to beat.\n\nConclusion: Amazing game with an enormous amount of re-playability, easily worth the full price if you're a fan of tower-defense/RTS type of games.\n\n[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1426071584, "timestamp_updated": 1426071682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486760", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14822497": {"recommendationid": "14822497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027819327", "num_games_owned": 698, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449951034}, "language": "english", "review": "Damn.

Everything comes down to building networks of weapons, shields, and other devices to slowly push forward against the rising tide. Full map terraforming, a wide variety of weapons and upgrades, movable towers, artillery, shields, and aircraft are all tools at your disposal. The story campaign has a wide and clever variety of mission types and goals, and an interesting \"big idea\" sci-fi story line reminiscent of Arther C. Clarke is the icing on the cake here. The random mission generator, huge variety of additional non-story missions, and sizable community map selection ensure you'll never run out of new challenges. A generally slow pace, as well as full pause-and-issue functionality, ensures that you can play as methodically as you like. Fair warning, there is one timed mission in the campaign (Farbor), but after a replay or two you'll be able to beat the 35 minute timer without too much difficulty.

However i personally got bored quite quickly, the story is barely believable, the music drove me to distraction and theres no veriety really, another map, another ooze producing blob that needs to die rinse and repeat but then again thats the formula for every Tower defence game out there. the ability to move turrets is great but i dont know     if they pioneered this gimic.", "timestamp_created": 1425823709, "timestamp_updated": 1425823709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14791324": {"recommendationid": "14791324", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994601982", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 1648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452339553}, "language": "english", "review": "very good game", "timestamp_created": 1425812587, "timestamp_updated": 1425812587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495251", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14776912": {"recommendationid": "14776912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103679671", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1414771203}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice game!

Achet\u00e9 en promo (comme toujours), je petit jeu ne m'a pas d\u00e9\u00e7u, et m'a m\u00eame agr\u00e9ablement surpris. C'est un genre de mix entre tower defense et STR, avec des petits bouts de puzzle game (mais franchement, cette description ne fait pas justice au jeu).\n\nLe principe est assez simple : contrairement aux tower defense traditionnels, o\u00f9 on doit repousser des vagues de cr\u00e9atures, dans CW3, il faut r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 r\u00e9sister \u00e0, puis repousser une substance visqueuse, couvrante, le creeper, qui envahit progressivement la map \u00e0 partir de spawners qui en g\u00e9n\u00e8rent en continu plus ou moins rapidement. Le creeper se comporte comme le ferait un fluide visqueux, en s'\u00e9coulant pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiellement vers les basses altitudes, puis une fois les trous remplis, le nieau de creeper monte, jusqu'\u00e0 atteindre les altitudes les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9es.\n\nLe joueur, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, dispose de trois types de ressources servant \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes choses (et qui deviendront accessibles au fil de la campagne) :\n- L'\u00e9nergie, ressource de base qui permet de construire des structures, alimenter les armes en munitions, ...\n- Le minerai, qui permet de fabriquer de l'anti-creeper, une substance qui se comporte comme du creeper, mais qui le vaporise par simple contact\nCes deux ressources ne circulent qu'\u00e0 travers des liaisons, que le joueur devra construire en cr\u00e9ant un maillage qui sera son r\u00e9seau de distribution.\n\n- L'aether, qui permet d'acheter des am\u00e9liorations dans la forge, un b\u00e2timent proposant d'am\u00e9liorer la production, le stockage des diverses ressources, la vitesse de construction, la cadence de tir et la port\u00e9e des armes, ...\nL(aether ne n\u00e9ssite pas de support pour corculer, et est envoy\u00e9 directement au Command Center (d\u00e9crit plus bas).\n\nContrairement \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 des STR, on n'accumule pas de la ressource pour la d\u00e9penser, on augmente sa capacit\u00e9 de g\u00e9n\u00e9ration, en unit\u00e9s par seconde. Les ressources ne s'\u00e9puisent pas, mais si l'on consomme plus qu'on ne produit, \u00e7a ralentit les constructions, ainsi que le ravitaillement des armes. Pas assre d'\u00e9nergie ? suffit de construire quelques g\u00e9n\u00e9rateurs ... ce qui consomme de l'\u00e9nergie :). Une mauvaise planification, et on a vite fait de perdre tout ou partie de la map.\n\nLe command center, b\u00e2timent de d\u00e9part, sert de buffer de petite taille, en recevant les ressources pour les redistribuer en fonction des besoins. Les ressources s'\u00e9coulent le long d'un r\u00e9seau que le joueur devra construire pour \u00eatre livr\u00e9es aux structures en construction ou aux armes.\n\nLe creeper d\u00e9truit toutes les constructions par contact, le but est donc de le repousser en consolidant son r\u00e9seau de transport d'\u00e9nergie, et de se frayer un chemin jusqu'au spawner, pour le d\u00e9truire \u00e0 l'aide d'une arme sp\u00e9cifique, le Nullifier, qui d\u00e9truit toute structure ennemie dans un petit rayon.\n\nLa campagne, d'une dur\u00e9e raisonnable, propose une histoire int\u00e9ressante et originale, qui se d\u00e9roule dans un futur extr\u00e8mement \u00e9loign\u00e9, plusieurs milliards d'ann\u00e9es. Personnellement, j'ai beaucoup aim\u00e9 la campagne. Mais la vraie dur\u00e9e de vie du jeu vient ensuite des maps hors campagne, cr\u00e9\u00e9es par la communaut\u00e9\n\nNiveau difficult\u00e9, la campagne est raisonnablement difficile (ou facile). Quelques missions demanderont plusieurs tentatives, de m\u00eame que quelques hauts-faits Steam, mais dans l'ensemble, pas besoin d'\u00eatre un PGM pour la boucler. Les maps cr\u00e9\u00e9es par la communaut\u00e9, par contre, peuvent \u00eatre tr\u00e8s faciles comme tr\u00e8s difficiles. A noter que les maps additionnelles peuvent inclure des m\u00e9canismes et des structures ennemies absentes de la campagne : un langage de programmation fait maison permet de cr\u00e9er des comportements nouveaux pour les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l'ennemi.\n\nLa jouabilit\u00e9 est bonne, les contr\u00f4les et l'interface se ma\u00eetrisent vite, attention toutefois, certaines missions avec un script particulier n\u00e9cessitant le contr\u00f4le d'un objet devront \u00eatr ejou\u00e9es avec les fl\u00e8ches plut\u00f4t qu'avec ZQSD, les touches pour contr\u00f4ler l'entit\u00e9 en question \u00e9tant hard-cod\u00e9es dans la jeu (ou alors je n'ai pas trouv\u00e9 les options pour les changer).\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 son, je vais rester unanime avec les autres avis que j'ai vus : tr\u00e8s bon, totalement int\u00e9gr\u00e9 au jeu, exactement la bande son qu'il fallait pour ce jeu.\n\nVoil\u00e0, un petit jeu addictif pas loin du sans faute, et pour un tarif contenu, que demande le peuple ?", "timestamp_created": 1424545961, "timestamp_updated": 1424545961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14571044": {"recommendationid": "14571044", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994099265", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506752234}, "language": "english", "review": "Been a fan of this series for a very long time,  it is an incredibly fun and laid back (if you want it to be you can go for speed but its not necessary on most missions) game. i could play this game every day and not tire of the concept.", "timestamp_created": 1424497401, "timestamp_updated": 1424497401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14530688": {"recommendationid": "14530688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009662092", "num_games_owned": 2285, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 1539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424261613}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been a huge Creeper World fan since I played the flash demo of the original release.  It's was the first time I ever paid an indie dev directly for a game.   After losing my serial key, and resorting to pirating, and griefing the dev on his personal forum about how stupid serial keys are, I swore I wouldn't him pay again until I could buy it from a proper distribution service.  Of course I wasn't going to not play CWII, so I pirated just, just like I warned him.  Basically, I've given this dev a lot crap.  At no point, however, have I ever changed my belief that Creeper World is, definitively, the most creative, dynamic, and all around best tower defense game on the market.  \n\nUnlike most wave based tower defense games, the eponymous creeper, somewhat akin to the nothing in Neverending Story, literally represents a tide of battle.  You find yourself struggling to mount a last ditch effort of defense in every map, desparate to get your defenses into place before it washes over you.  As you struggle to build up your (de/off)ense, the waves is getting ever higher, denser, and harder to push back.  Then there's that moment;  your towers start pushing back, you inch them forward and add some more.  The creeper starts to wane.  You close in for the kill.  You have conquered insanity.  It was a close call.\n\nCWII was a unique and addictive game in it's own right, bringing plenty of brilliance to the table, and a completely different experience.  Played from a side view, with a variety of new units and resources, it's very much the Zelda II of the series.  I strongly encourage you to play them both, and I hope he brings them to Steam; I will buy them in an instant.\n\nCreeper World III absolutely lives up to the legacy of brilliance.  Not only does it merge all of the extended unit and resources from the second game into the playstyle of the first,  It refines and expands on the concepts to offer a diversity of experience I simply wasn't prepared for.   I kind of expected more of the same, and what I got instead was my mind blown.\n\nEvery map is a righteous experience.  The amount of content is mindblowing.  It's the best tower defense game on the market.

You are a captain of a ship who has just woken up after a very very long time in cryo sleep and in the time you have been gone humanity has vanished as all the civilasations that once were have been wiped out by the creeper, a strange organism which destroys everything it touches. At the time of writing this review I have only put in three hours and have barely scratched the surface but as you can see from other reviewers' play time there is a lot to this game and a lot of replayability.\n\n+Nice pixel graphics\n+Simple UI and great controls\n+A very interesting story \n+Interesting concept, instead of building towers in the path of an oncoming enemy you create networks of towers and take the fight to the enemy. There are small enemy towers which emitt the creepers which gradually spread across the map, using towers you have to beat back the creepers until your network of towers is close enough to use a special offensive tower which destroys the emitter. The gameplay is quite hard to explain and I probably haven't done it justice so it's best to watch some gameplay videos.\n+Your towers can be moved as the creepers are beaten back out of range of your towers\n+It's challenging without feeling too difficult or unfair\n+The mission menu is an interactive starmap and you get to see your ship travel from one planet or star system to another\n+Nice soundtrack\n+Can be paused at any point during a mission\n+You can create and share your own levels\n\n-Either some people are god-like at this game or the leaderboards have been cheated\n-If you make any mistakes with what you build early on in a mission it usually ruins your chances of winning, for example if you don't build enough reactors at the start and you run low on energy later in the game you will most likely be destroyed. It adds another layer of difficulty but it can be pretty annoying\n\nVerdict:\n9 \n\nAn absolutely brilliant game that is more like an RTS than a TD with an impressively good story, a must buy for fans of either genre.\n\nEl K.", "timestamp_created": 1424268266, "timestamp_updated": 1433341770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 94, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657400", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14525937": {"recommendationid": "14525937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045149740", "num_games_owned": 369, "num_reviews": 270, "playtime_forever": 1626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504389483}, "language": "english", "review": "[u]What I liked:[/u]\n[list]\n    [*]Simple Concept, Challenging Gameplay\n    [*]Good variety in weapon for TD(Tower Defence)\n    [*]Open ended stratergies\n[/list]\n[u]What You Need to Know:[/u]\n[list]\n    [*]This is a hybrid of a TD and RTS, you use towers and ships, but there are no lanes and level up of  towers\n    [*]Your main enemy is the creep, which is a purple fliud that is like a great wall that is constantly attacking you\n    [*]You do have other things that mix up the the enemy tactics, such as spore towers, difficult spider web bridge things with stunning robot spiders and a few others\n    [*]You can make your own maps with a built in editor, which is easy to use or just use the random generator to quickly play limiteless maps, and even play other peoples maps\n    [*]There is no one way to win the maps, you can play it like you want, not forcing you down one path to beat a mission\n    [*]Your main goal in every mission is to destroy the creep spawners, and other towers, leaving a ring behind for each one that you can use to upgrade whatever turret placed in it.( SUPERCHARGE BABY!!)\n    [*]One of my personal favorite TD/RTS games\n    [*]I played this game alot already before on steam ( So hours played is not my true time)\n    [*]A game that can be as easy as you want or as complicated as you want to make it\n\n[/list]\n\n[h1]My Score:[/h1]\n[b]A+[/b]\n\n[b]Paid $1.50[/b]\n[b]Completed in: 15 hours/b]\n\nGames similar: \n[list]\n    [*]Infested Planet\n    [*]Supreme Commander\n    [*]AI War: Fleet Command\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1424243693, "timestamp_updated": 1467773576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497678", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14523031": {"recommendationid": "14523031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026394897", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 1989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483068327}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1424222189, "timestamp_updated": 1424222189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496278", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14518785": {"recommendationid": "14518785", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996048842", "num_games_owned": 692, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 7799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512840535}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the more unique RTS games you'll play.

Mais tous ces syst\u00e8mes n\u00e9cessitent d'\u00eatre aliment\u00e9s et connect\u00e9s \u00e0 votre Command Node, votre QG de d\u00e9part sur chaque partie. Celui-ci ne pouvant pas assumer seul le d\u00e9bit d'\u00e9nergie requis pour faire fonctionner votre arsenal, vous devrez construire des g\u00e9n\u00e9rateurs d'\u00e9nergie. Beaucoup de g\u00e9n\u00e9rateurs d'\u00e9nergie. \nCar l\u00e0 o\u00f9 le jeu diff\u00e8re d'un tower d\u00e9fense classique, c'est que vous d\u00e9fendre du Creeper n'est que la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape : il faut ensuite l'\u00e9radiquer, celui-ci ne faisant que se d\u00e9verser \u00e0 l'infini sur la carte. Il faut progresser dans un flot continu et mortel de ce truc jusqu'\u00e0 atteindre la source et la d\u00e9truire. Et si par malheur vous tombez en p\u00e9nurie d'\u00e9nergie... Au mieux vous perdez du terrain et stabilisez la situation en retrait, au pire le Creeper engloutit toute la map et c'est perdu (\u00e7a peut allez tr\u00e8s vite, croyez moi).\nC'est donc un jeu disons \"en flux tendu\". Si vous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 jou\u00e9 \u00e0 Supreme Commander, vous ne serez pas d\u00e9pays\u00e9 ici au niveau de la gestion des ressources. Un income par seconde et un petit stock pour amortir les brusques variations, voil\u00e0 tout ce dont vous avez droit. Et c'est ce qui fait que la tension est constante au cours d'une partie : on observe notre d\u00e9fense, les points o\u00f9 \u00e7a fuite, l'\u00e9nergie utilis\u00e9e, et quand tout semble \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s stabilis\u00e9 on essaye de gagner du terrain. Et on r\u00e9p\u00e8te le processus petit \u00e0 petit...\nLe gameplay est donc plaisant et ma\u00eetris\u00e9 qui plus est, avec notamment un syst\u00e8me de pause active bienvenue.\n\n[b]Une bande-son parfaite[/b]\nVoil\u00e0 la premi\u00e8re surprise que nous offre le titre de Knuckle Cracker : les musiques.\nC'est assez simple j'ai rarement vu des OST collant aussi bien \u00e0 un jeu... Une petite dizaine de piste tout au plus et pourtant on ne s'en lasse pas. Elles participent largement \u00e0 l'ambiance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du titre et sont en ad\u00e9quation avec la trame sc\u00e9naristique, elle aussi surprenante !\n\n[b]Une histoire captivante ?![/b]\nEt oui... Voil\u00e0 donc la derni\u00e8re chose que j'attendais de ce jeu : un sc\u00e9nario.\nJe veux dire, je l'ai achet\u00e9 car je connaissais un peu le gameplay via le jeu flash, et je voulais passer \u00e0 la vitesse sup\u00e9rieure... Mais c'est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s tout. Un jeu pareil on ne s'attend pas \u00e0 grand chose au niveau de la \"campagne\"... Et pourtant ! Quelle ne f\u00fbt pas ma stup\u00e9faction [spoiler]la ZerarmY est en marche ![/spoiler] lorsque je me suis retrouv\u00e9 devant une histoire originale et rafra\u00eechissante, avec des notions que l'on a pas l'habitude de voir. Pour faire rapide et sans spoiler, on parle ici non pas d'une science fiction qui prend place en 2050 ou 2242, mais des milliards d'ann\u00e9es plus tard. On ne parle pas de la Terre en particulier, mais de civilisations humaines ayant colonis\u00e9 des galaxies enti\u00e8res... Les ordres de grandeur sont assez inhabituels et j'ai trouv\u00e9 \u00e7a tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ciable. Car m\u00eame si la campagne n'a pas une dur\u00e9e de vie tr\u00e8s longue, les notions abord\u00e9es nous permettent de r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir sur certaines choses sous un angle diff\u00e9rent, et \u00e7a fait du bien bordel.\n\n\n[b]En conclusion, tr\u00e8s bonne surprise ![/b] \nDes m\u00e9caniques de jeu uniques, une bande-son g\u00e9niale et un sc\u00e9nario surprenant, que demander de plus ! A mon sens, ce jeu m\u00e9rite \u00e0 \u00eatre plus connu.\nSi vous voulez exp\u00e9rimenter le gameplay je vous conseil d'essayer le premier Creeper World, qui est en fait un jeu flash.

The Creeper is a [b]fluid[/b] of alien origin and malicious intent, it absorbs and destroys anything constructed it touches. This changes the entire dynamic and feel of the game.\n\nThe goal (in most levels) is to activate totems that are strewn about the (bird's eye perspective 2D) map without having your base be destroyed by creeper. Creeper flows in continuously from spawn points and you build out a network of structures from your command ship to fend off the creeper (or even destroy its spawn points). The buildings are either combat focused (the traditional tower defence type towers) or utilitarian.\nBecause the resource system is quite different from a regular tower defence game as well (and is surprisingly similar to Supreme Commander / Total Annihilation instead), you have 'Energy' which is used to build structures, arm your towers and charge up totems. Energy is stored in your command ship and then flows along the nodes formed by the buildings you created, like a spider web that slowly grows outward (and not unlike the creeper that slowly washes over the map).\n\nA simple level progression would be to land your command ship at a strategically good location (high ground, remember that your enemy is basically a liquid so it'll flow into the low spaces first), start building collectors (buildings that gather energy from their direct surroundings) and laser towers to protect the collectors which you slowly move up with the front as the collector field grows in size (all offensive towers can be moved across the map whenever you want).\n\nOf course things get far more complicated later on, with the addition of new towers including mortars, bombers and snipers. New enemies like a creeper-formed network that will always transmit the creeper even if it's uphill, building-disabling enemies living on this network and even aerial creeper that will occasionally spawn from specific enemy buildings and head for your base.\n\nAll these things (and a lot more) are slowly introduced over the course of an excellent 30 or so campaign that even has a pretty engaging storyline (the game is set thousands of years after Creeper World 1 and 2, so you don't need to know all that much from them to get the gist of things. Unfortunately they were never released on Steam. For a sample of the gameplay from Creeper World 1 and 2 (and even 3, in case you want to try it out) there are in-browser options available [url=http://www.kongregate.com/games/whiteboardwar]here[/url]).\n\nThere is one mission right at the end of one of the two branches of the game's plot that is very different from the others though, and not in a good way. Unlike pretty much the rest of the game it has a time limit, and a harsh one at that. In the rest of the game (especially within the campaign) it's pretty hard to lose as long as you take things slow and don't over-extend yourself. This one mission completely messes that up and asks you to rush in and beat the clock. It's not a bad concept I guess, but terribly executed and I ended up downloading an in-mission savegame in order to bypass it because I just couldn't beat it.\n\nOther than that single (but major) gripe there is nothing but praise for this game. The campaign mode (which will last you a good long while) is only the tip of ice berg, as there are thousands upon thousands of additional levels that you will need a lifetime to complete. These range from fun levels the beta testers came up with, to nasty challenge levels the creator put in, to a whole universe of bonus levels, to procedurally generated levels. There is also an in-game level editor, complete with a way to directly share them with others and play their levels and tools to change anything in the game.\n\nGo give the game's free version a shot, and if the gameplay at all grabs you this is an excellent value purchase.

Having played Creeper World and Creeper World 2, this follows the game design of the former. While the graphics may be on a lower end than that of normal games, it provides hours and hours of fantastic gameplay.\n\nFor newbies. game elements are introduced to you slowly through the storyline, all the way up to the boss map (hello Thor!). The storyline does build off CW1 and CW2, so you might be a bit lost in understanding any plot and twists. Recommendation to play the first two iterations first - they are both great games.\n\nThe game allows you to freely tab out (I'm looking at you Popcap) while remaining in play, and you are able to micromanage and rearrange your defenses when paused - a definite plus. You also get multiple save slots! The speed up buttons are also a wonderful addition - anyone that has played tower defenses will appreciate speed up buttons (1x, 2x, 3x and 4x). \n\nPlus point is that all your games are cloud saved on Steam - no more having to rebeat the entire storymap and more when you change a new computer or accidentally clear your files! The Alpha and Prospector sector are two such additions which will provide an eternity more of gameplay once you finish storymode. The maps are heavily varied, ranging from small maps to huge maps - all of which will require different strategies. It doesn't feel like you're merely doing the same thing over and over again. And if you ever finish the abovementioned sectors (has anyone?!), there are plenty more user-made levels for you to try out.\n\nAn average map generally ranges about 15 - 25 minutes to win. It's a great game to play in between other games for a short break or while waiting for queue times. \n\nFor only SGD15.00, easily worth every single cent. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1420489227, "timestamp_updated": 1420489227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13848791": {"recommendationid": "13848791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135836452", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 65260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479173084}, "language": "english", "review": "I used to play this ditty on Kongregate! KnuckleCracker still knows how to impress.\n\nYou've watched the gameplay, you get the concept - you're fighting a blob; storyline irrelevent. Figure out where to land your HQ and lay out some power infrastructure. Get to the point you can build two power structures at once, build a few sets of two. Construct a laser and mortar, click \"stop resupply\" and when they're built - figure out which one you need first - click \"disarm\" and then \"resupply\" and then do the same for the second weapon. Construct a third weapon, your choice, I prefer mortars over lasers 4/1 so I'd make two mortars.\n\nThe trick with mortars and your power supply is, they recharge faster than they fire. So you can pinch off their supply, use it to construct and power other buildings, and stop them - then resupply the mortars more quickly than over-loading your entire power supply would. By playing \"half-court\" with the power supply, I have been able to greatly improve my speed. Some levels that I've thought were impossible, I've re-visited and been able to beat; some are still impossible.\n\nSome cheats must exist because of high scores. High scores mean nothing though. You play, you win and lose, you have fun, you get frustrated, you leave, you come back and figure out a new layout or move on. It's a good game.

Fair warning: you will become addicted to it, and rack up 20 hours playing it in a  single week. I've played it over 10 hours in two *days*.\n\nThe trailer, pictures, and even description on CW3's store page fail to do the game justice. It's RTS only in that you can place and move units while the timer is running. It's TD only in that your units only fire while sitting still, and half of your units can't move once placed. Allow me to paint you a different picture of this game. The creeper is like water that bubbles up from the ground, and you can't touch the water...because you're a cat with a lot of really cool turrets. Each of your turrets does something different. Half of your turrets aren't offensive devices; they're used to set up the infrastructure of your base, collecting resources, etc. Your energy recharges continuously, but your base can output more energy than it collects, and will eventually reach equillibrium with your input. When you start to net energy income, do you build more energy collectors, or new weapons? Eventually, you can terraform the map at large energy output, but you don't need the terraformers on constantly. Want a turret at a different location to combat the creeper? Your offensive turrets can fly. to new locations, but if your infrastructure hasn't caught up to the front, their ammo stores will drain rapidly.\n\nEach map is essentially a series of multi-step problems that can be solved in a variety of ways, especially as you unlock more turrets. Early in the game, it's pretty obvious what tactics the map maker had in mind, promarily because you haven't yet uinlocked all of the turrets. But not even half-way through the initial campaign, you come to understand the myriad paths you can take to solve each particular step of a problem. Terraforming is a big part of this: because you can literally change the shape of the map, setting up infrastructure one way opens up different solutions down the road.\n\nThe two extremes of the spectrum of CW3 players are probably Speed Runners <----> Slow and Steady. I'm the latter right now, which is one of the reasons missions take me so long: I spend more than half the run-time with the timer paused. But you've got to be careful while paused: queue up too many turrets, and your production rapidly outpaces your income, slowing your entire system. The game doesn't punish you for being either kind of player--on most levels, your resources don't dwindle over time, so you could play a single map for hours in a trenchy-style of building one row of turrets just in front of your previous row. The game *does* punish you for not paying attention--being fast is definitely doable if your minimalistic solution has all of the right components. \n\nCW3 is a phenomenal example of the adage: gamers prefer good mechanics to good graphics. But don't let the 2D simplistic art scheme fool you. Not only are the mechanics solid, the performance stellar, but the interface is also straight-forward, and the controls seem pretty intuitive. Left-click to select, right-click-hold to move around the map. Zoom in/out with mouse wheel. Escape to un-select or exit out of a selection. The visuals and animations tell you what you need to know, and if something isn't working like you expected, it's pretty easy to figure out why.\n\nI wouldn't say it's a difficult game in the initial campaign, but it *is* intense regardless of your strategy.

It's a RTS Tower defense-esque game, this might not sound like a good idea, but it works beautifully. There are two main mechanics that I will address:\n\n1. The Creeper. This is your enemy, it's a liquid entity that creeps forward from spawners, slowly covering more and more of the stage. You need to build towers to fight it back, and in turn advance farther along the stage yourself. Creeper would be very difficult to deal with if it didn't obey the laws of physics. Basically, in order for creeper to overflow onto a higher level of terrain, it has to have nowhere else to go on its current level. This leads to some fairly interesting placements, like a very powerful spawner at the bottom of a deep crater. There are plenty of other enemies too, runners and digitalis namely. Runners just run along digitalis and need to be destroyed with sniper towers, they can't directly destroy your towers, but can stun them long enough for creeper to overflow onto them. Digitalis is a kind of grid-like enemy that conducts creeper and prevents towers from being built, trust me, it's more difficult than it sounds.\n\n2. The Network. This game has parallels to a tower defense game, but calling it one doesn't do it justice. The biggest conventional differences being: Towers are networked, they have to be connected to your base to function; Towers can be moved freely, even off the network, albeit with limited ammo; towers use energy, constantly.\n\nThe biggest difference as I stated is the network. You have to build collectors and relays between towers to provide pathways for the \"packets\" of which there are three types, ammo, construction, and totem. This means you can't just build towers in the most strategic spots right away, you have to build out to them, often fighting tooth and nail to get to them. Additionally, these packets cost energy, which is distributed evenly between the active types of packets, energy is obtained through collectors, which collect energy across an area, and reactors. Collectors gain no benefit from overlapping area and should be spread out, they are also one of the main staples in your network of towers. If you get too ambitious with your expansion, you'll enter energy starvation, where packets are produced less efficiently and you run the risk of your blasters running out of ammo and the line being pushed back.\n\nBetween the campaign mode and the hundreds of other levels in the game + fan made ones, you could get hundreds of hours out of this game (I didn't because I just played creeper world 1 and 2 before it and was done after the campaign). Having played all three games, this is the best. \n\nEven at full price, I think you'll get your money's worth, this is a difficult game, you will need to think strategically and act quickly. It's a refreshing change of pace from most RTS and tower defense games in my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1420091640, "timestamp_updated": 1420091640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13750912": {"recommendationid": "13750912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035278162", "num_games_owned": 458, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487364699}, "language": "english", "review": "Although it may look simple \u2013 the mechanics and controls certainly are \u2013 Creeper World 3 proves to be surprisingly challenging.

But I always got a bit tired of the repetative movement of putting down another tower, upgrading them blah blah blah.... and then just leaving the game to run it's course, throwing wave after wave of enemies until your computer began to stutter and lag behind as it was somehow managing to cope with an incredible array of pixals being thrown into your eyeballs. I am mainly talking about the infamous Bloons TD, which will always remain my favourite TD, although there are others. However, this game is a little different in that respect. \n\nI like to think of it as a combination of a TD and RTS, in the sense that The Creeper, some blue liquid thing, is not stuck on rails and just has to get from A to B as it floats down a path ignoring all defences on its journey, it is instead open to go where it pleases, only limited by the geography of the landscape. The RTS element in the game is the fact that you build up cannons to protect your 'base' and resource collectors. They take time to build and must be placed strategically in order to maximise the efficiency of your defence and keep The Creeper at bay. After that, you must push forward and move your defences forward even more. But they can get delinked from getting resources, so extenders are put in place. On large maps, it can be very rewarding seeing a huge web of links and seeing your packages of Anti-Creeper and firepower flowing down these pathways. \n\nIn later missions, more enemies arise and give even more things to think about when planning out defences, but don't worry. A reasonably nice variety in defence types can help with that.

I have a few top 10 high scores (look for Seika), I've completed the story, and whole heck of a lot of missions in Tormented Space area (hard mode), so I have quite a bit of familiarity with the game.\n\nPros:\n-A unique take on strategy that generally emphasizes resource and space management more than managing unit tactics, and the enemy is a rather literal tide rather than a more discreet set of units\n-Huge array of playable content, with a wide variety of maps.\n-Once you clear the main campaign, there are three main modes of pre-constructed maps. Prospector Zone has literally hundreds if not thousands of hours of content, Tormented Space exists for a good challenge, and Alpha Sector has some interesting and often difficult custom maps.\n\nCons:\n-There is little to no AI to speak of. Certain types of enemies are capable of either roaming around randomly, and another will target random sections of your grid, but otherwise, the enemy will follow a strict pattern every map. Except for speed running, there is little point to replaying a map.\n-Music will get repetitive.There is a mute button for a reason.\n-Once you clear the main campaign, there are three modes. Prospector Zone is where much of the game's content lies, but the (generally) lower difficulty and lack of custom scripting means that most of these maps will get boring and repetitive. Tormented Space is not always the best tested: Some maps will feel almost as easy as the tutorial, while others are quite literally impossible without cheating (there is a thread on the Knuckle Cracker Forum dedicated to which maps are super difficult, which are insanely difficult [often requiring odd tricks in order to even stand a chance], which are possibly impossible, and which are undeniably impossible). If I have any complaint about Alpha Sector, it is that many of these maps were designed by some of the best players to be at their level, so it can be hard to make progress through those missions.\n\nThe game can feel repetitive, particularly playing too much in too short a time, but the game has kept me hooked.

You don't build mazes.  You don't upgrade towers.  There are no units to attack.  Yet, it contains a lot of the same mechanics as TD games:  you build towers which attack for you;  you decide whether to spend or invest resources; you strategically place towers at the right places and times.  Thus, I don't feel uncomfortable categorizing this in the Tower Defense genre.\n\nThe game goes like this:  you expand your base to earn resources.  The larger the surface-area of your base, the more resources-per-second you earn.  Meanwhile, the \"enemy\" is simply a geyser of fluid [i](called \"creeper\")[/i] which spreads out in all directions.  If the fluid touches a tower, that tower dies.  You use your towers to push back the fluid, so you can get close enough to destroy the geyser(s).\n\nOn paper, it sounds stupid.  But then again, I would have said the same thing about TD games at first, and now they are my favorite genre.\n\nIn reality, this is a [i]fantastic[/i] game.  The game constantly introduces new gameplay-elements throughout the campaign, keeping it fresh and unrepetitive.  The levels are never too easy, but also never too hard [i](the main campaign, at least)[/i].

Es handelt sich dabei um einen erfrischenden Strategietitel, der vieles anders als die Konkurrenz macht. Eine gallertartige Masse namens \"Creeper\" \u00fcberschwemmt nach und nach jeden bewohnten Planeten des Universums und l\u00f6scht auf diese Weise alles Leben aus. Jeglicher Versuch, diesen Vormarsch aufzuhalten, ist bisher fehlgeschlagen. Wir springen ein paar Milliarden Jahre in die Zukunft, wo wir wiedererwachen, uns an den alten Auftrag erinnern und feststellen m\u00fcssen, was passiert ist. \u00dcber eine lockere, teilweise etwas d\u00fcnne Handlung treibt einen die Geschichte von Planet zu Planet, wo wir mit immer neuen Herausforderungen k\u00e4mpfen m\u00fcssen, den \"Creeper\" zu verdr\u00e4ngen und ben\u00f6tigte Gegenst\u00e4nde zu sichern. Der Spielablauf bleibt variantenreich und man hat immer das Gef\u00fchl, viele L\u00f6sungsstrategien zu haben. Wer sich von der einfachen Grafik nicht abhalten l\u00e4sst, findet bei Creeper World 3 einen interessanten, innovativen Strategietitel, der einen mindestens 25 Stunden lang besch\u00e4ftigt. Nach den Storymissionen gibt es noch hunderte weitere ins Spiel integrierte Welten zu entdecken.

The developer did a good job adding enough elements to this episode to keep the gameplay interesting throughout the campaign.\nIt's an interesting strategy game, where you know how the enemy will behave from the start (since it follows fluid physics) and yet every map requires you to think about how to approach it with the land provided and the techs unlocked. The gameplay is solid, it is decently challenging for a first walkthrough (yet nothing a player with any experience in the genre will not be able to tackle) and offers a chance for speedrunning/score attack replays of existing maps. Apart from the campaign (which took me somewhere between 8 and 10 hours at a leisurly pace), the game has a couple extra modes with different objectives, for even more longevity.\n\nThe problems I have with the game are mostly outside of the gameplay itself. The game asks for a relatively high price tag for a series evolved from a Flash game, but does it add enough to make it reasonable? In my eyes, it doesn't.\nThe storyline is ridiculous, it pretty much revolves for the entire campaign around the idea of \"I lost my memory, what's all of this?\". You could skip every dialogue in the game and not miss anything relevant. The only campaign progression is the gradual introduction of more buildings and techs.\nWhich leads to the second point: after you unlock everything and you figure out which approach works best for you, most of the extra modes are more of the same. Which is good if you want to play more on different maps, but it lacks the tailored scenarios of the campaign. Still, it's good to come back from time to time for a map or two and have a large selection of unexplored locations.\nThe graphics haven't improved in a relevant way compared to the Flash chapters. The soundtrack is very limited and you will get bored of the few track really fast.\n\nAll things considered it's still a game I'd pick up, but at a sensible discount, since it's reasonably fun to play for a while but lacks the added value to justify the price point.", "timestamp_created": 1407917606, "timestamp_updated": 1407917634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497972", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11624554": {"recommendationid": "11624554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047884970", "num_games_owned": 5460, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 2409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1408710137}, "language": "czech", "review": ".: Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal :.", "timestamp_created": 1407650393, "timestamp_updated": 1407650393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.304378", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11599318": {"recommendationid": "11599318", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993248645", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486390116}, "language": "english", "review": "VERY addictive game, think tower defence but instead of defending against just mobs your defending against water.

It's basic yet complex appearance may overwhelm those new to the genre, but Knuckle Cracker did a good job on slowly pacing the user into the concepts around Creeper World 3. \n\nThe graphics of Creeper World 3 aren't anything extraordinary but they are pretty solid. The terrain is in a variety of colors and the illusion of layers is clearly there. The various tools and weapons stand out from the terrain and are simple to realize through the variation in shape and color. While everything looks basic throughout the game, the graphics are crisp and clear - and that's good enough for a tower defense game. \n\nThe core gameplay of Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal is one that is new to me. While I have played other games in the same sort of genre, Creeper World 3 is unique in the sense that it's attempting to fuse both Tower Defense and Strategy-Simulation. While the majority of tower defense's have you place your weapons on a certain path as enemies start to come at you on a predictable path - Creeper World 3 is adds a refreshing twist. Your enemy is the creeper. The creeper spreads outward in all directions, covering the terrain and destroying everything in it's path. It is your job to use the weapons at your disposal to take out the source of the creeper - being the emmiters. While it may not sound that hard, which it really isn't at first; the difficulty begins to ramp up. It will be very challenging for newcomers - including me at times, but I never really felt that the game was cheating. I also realized what mistakes I made if I were to fail. Throughout the game, you will play a variety of maps with the inclusion of the story. The story arc is the weakest point about this game, it's very forgettable and did nothing to increase the immersion or gameplay. It's a good effort nonetheless. The mouse controls are also great - with the ability to pause the game, plan you moves and move your units around where you please. Overall, the core mechanics of Creeper World 3 is great and will be something for all games in the similar genre to beat. \n\nThe audio is good for a game like this. In all honestly, what can you expect. The music is fine with the occasion of it being repetitive. I found myself turning off the music at various times. The sound effects are pretty simple. Nothing special here.\n\nCreeper World 3's greatest strength is it's value. Like Skyrim, Portal 2 and Torchlight 2 before them, the sheer amount of user content is mind-blowing. At a cheap price of $15, it's pretty hard to not pick this one up if you are a fan of the genre. There are an abundance of maps, both pre-made and user-made all varying in difficulty. It's also good to note that some maps have been known as unbeatable. A random map generator is also here as well as an in-game editor to create your own maps for others to try. Creeper World 3 also has over 130 achievements for those who are into them. \n\nIn conclusion, Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal was one of the more surprising buys for me. I didn't think I would enjoy the game this much. It is something I will continue to play for years to come. \n\nGRAPHICS: 8.0/10\nGAMEPLAY: 9.5/10\nSTORY: 5.0/10\nAUDIO: 7.0/10\nCONTROLS: 9.0/10\nVALUE: 10/10\n\nOVERALL: 8.1/10\n\n+Refereshing take on genre\n+Challenging yet Fun\n+Solid Controls\n+Addictive\n+Great Variety in Maps and Units\n+Overwhelming amount of content \n+130+ Achievements\n+Inexpensive\n\n+/- Some Unbeatable Maps\n\n-Weak Story\n-Repetitive Music\n-Can sometimes be a grind", "timestamp_created": 1404384737, "timestamp_updated": 1404397430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503224", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11023559": {"recommendationid": "11023559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033923433", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 3022, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417811481}, "language": "english", "review": "A strategy game about fighting a liquid.\nThat actually works.\nThat requires [u]almost no irritating micromanagement[/u].\nThat caters to both turtlers and rushers.\n\nThat is a third instalment in a series that takes previous two - radically different - installments and merges their best elements to create a perfected version of the original.\n\nThat is produced by a Nice Guy Developer who offers demo, [i]\"full game lite\"[/i] Flash-based demo, map editor and a riddiculous amount of display options for your convenience.\n\nWhat's not to like?", "timestamp_created": 1404321476, "timestamp_updated": 1404321476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501317", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11021066": {"recommendationid": "11021066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116833520", "num_games_owned": 617, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422195025}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud654\uba74\uc5d0 \uac74\ubb3c\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c \ubcf5\uc7a1\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub77c \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\ub294\ub370 \uc804\ud600 \uadf8\ub807\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc5b8\uc5b4\uc758 \uc7a5\ubcbd\uc774 \uc5c6\uc74c\n\n\uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uac04\ub2e8\ud788 \uc694\uc57d\ud558\uba74 \"\ubb3c \ub9c9\uae30\" \uac8c\uc784", "timestamp_created": 1404312565, "timestamp_updated": 1404312565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11020796": {"recommendationid": "11020796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066367276", "num_games_owned": 630, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451280477}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7b97\u662f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53c8\u6709\u5854\u9632\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4e0d\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5374\u610f\u5916\u7684\u4ee4\u4eba\u6c89\u8ff7\u3002\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u4e3b\u7ebf\u6545\u4e8b\u60c5\u8282\u90e8\u5206\u5173\u5361\u4e0d\u7b97\u591a\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6545\u4e8b\u60c5\u8282\u8fd8\u633a\u6709\u610f\u601d\u7684\u3002\u6545\u4e8b\u60c5\u8282\u73a9\u5b8c\u4e4b\u540e\u6765\u5230\u65b0\u89e3\u9501\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u73a9\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u661f\u7cfb\u4e4b\u540e\u4e00\u8fdb\u8df3\u8dc3\u70b9\u2014\u2014\u6ee1\u773c\u5bc6\u5bc6\u9ebb\u9ebb\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u2026\u2026\n\u597d\u5427\uff0c\u770b\u6765\u518d\u8017\u4e0a\u51e0\u767e\u5c0f\u65f6\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1404311403, "timestamp_updated": 1404311403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11014855": {"recommendationid": "11014855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041600295", "num_games_owned": 2879, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 10260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512198117}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is suprisingly awesome.

You use nodes to create webs which energy then passes through to power your weapons/defenses and beat back the ever-encroaching purple creeper \"mist\". Its addictive and you will have the temptation to go \"one more level\" everyime you think you're going to quit. The graphics and sound are adequate, but not great, But who plays these games for the graphics? If you are an RTS/TD fan, this game is defintely one to pick up even at full price. It's tiny bit pricy at full price for those who arent die-hard fans of RTS/TD games, but if you see it on sale, get it!\n\nMAIN:\nThis game is fascinating. Its a really unique RTS/tower defense, the style of which vaguely reminds me of the Zerg in the original Starcraft. But there are no barracks for units, no movable parts. No vespene gas.\n\nYou have awoken in space after a 5-billion(!?) year stasis sleep, to find that the Creeper has again rampaged around destroying humanity's galactic empire. Of course, you must stop them. Its kind of difficult to explain how this game works without seeing it, but I'll do my best:\n\nThe Creepers have emitters which slowly start filling the map with purple stuff. If this purple stuff touches one of your buildings it is destroyed. You need to destroy all the emitters to progress. Sometimes there are other objectives as well.\n\nSo you build a command center far away from the emitters. Then you start building nodes and weapons such as cannons. Each node creates lines to the nodes next to it, and power flows through these lines from the command center to your weapons/cannons as well as newly placed buildings to construct them. Cannons cant link to each other, but only to nodes and relay nodes. So you want to build as many nodes to create a web, then a front line of weapons to hold off the onslaught, slowly building more relay nodes and weapons as you manage to beat back the \"purple mist\".\n\n The nodes also generate energy, which you need to power your cannons and build things quickly. Build too fast, and your energy goes out of balance, weakening the ammo resupply to your cannons and allowing the evil purple stuff to overrun them.\n\nThere are also specialty nodes, such as relays which speed up energy transmission to new nodes and weapons, reactors, which provide lots of energy, special weapons, and many others I havent seen yet.\n\nTheres a lot of strategy, figuring out the best place to put your nodes to create fast transmission of power as well as beat back the purple mist, but not overbuilding so you end up overrun. \n\nMissions are timed, although as of yet I havent seen any where you \"must beat the mission in (x) amount of time\", but I wouldnt be surprised if they were out there (I hate those types of missions...I'm naturally a careful player who tries to do/see everything in any game I play. I HATE being rushed.). The fun of being timed is a global leaderboard where you can see rankings of how fast people have beat the missions.\n\nThe graphics are nothing to write home about, just little representations of the terrain, units, your node web, claimed territories, ect. But who cares? The strategy is what matters here, and I'll take gameplay over graphics any day of the year.\n\nSound is the same as graphics. Its ok, but nothing spectacular. Lots of pew pew and booms.\n\nOverall, this is a unique and interesting game. There appear to be many many levels to play as well as a storyline. Its really fun, and if you see it on sale is a must buy for any RTS/tower defense fan.", "timestamp_created": 1404070579, "timestamp_updated": 1404070579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503940", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10950058": {"recommendationid": "10950058", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982466188", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 28148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 138, "last_played": 1516281921}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u3010\u4f11\u9592\u5c0f\u54c1\u3011\n\n\u5df2\u6d88\u6ec5\u6c34(?)\u70ba\u4e3b\u9ad4\u7684\u3010\u958b\u653e\u5f0fTD\u3011\u904a\u6232\n\n\u904a\u6232\u770b\u5f0f\u7c21\u55ae\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5f8c\u9762\u6bcf\u4e00\u95dc\u90fd\u8db3\u5920\u6d88\u8017\u6389\u4f60\u6bcf\u4e00\u500b\u5bf6\u8cb4\u7684\u4e00\u5c0f\u6642\u6642\u9593wwwww\n\n\u5b98\u65b9\u95dc\u5361\u5168\u7834\u6216\u662f\u73a9\u9006\u5f8c\n\u9084\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u7dda\u4e0a\u73a9\u5bb6\u81ea\u5df1\u81ea\u88fd\u7684\u5730\u5716\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f86\u904a\u73a9\n\n\u552f\u4e00\u6700\u53ef\u60dc\u8207\u6700\u5927\u7684\u7f3a\u9ede\u5c31\u662f.....\n\u4e0d\u80fd\u591a\u4eba\u9023\u7dda=3=+", "timestamp_created": 1404068912, "timestamp_updated": 1412119458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572527", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10945496": {"recommendationid": "10945496", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032685508", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 932, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450388743}, "language": "english", "review": "This is good TD game!\nIt's 2d TD game with pretty big pile of Maps to play on and big variety of Towers.\nYou can build your own electricity net and put some towers.\nIf you like TD games - this is good one!", "timestamp_created": 1404060231, "timestamp_updated": 1404060231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10943414": {"recommendationid": "10943414", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964247971", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413309303}, "language": "german", "review": "Super Strategiespiel, wer braucht schon Grafik ?\nIch bin auch immer skeptisch, wenn ich solche Retro-Vorschaubilder sehe.. kaufen Leute wirklich nett gemacht..\n\nIm Ernst Creeper 1 war grafisch etwas besser, sch\u00f6nere Farben, nicht ganz so pixelig.\n\nKann ich trotzdem nur jedem empfehlen !\n\nFalls jemand testen m\u00f6chte, es gab Creeper World mal als Flash-Game, einfach googeln.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1404055579, "timestamp_updated": 1404055579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10925633": {"recommendationid": "10925633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105358907", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 991, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430111189}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

I've put quite a few hours into it. For those of you put off by the fairly simplistic graphics, don't be! It's the [b]gameplay[/b] which is the real selling point of this game.\n\nFor those of you on the fence, imagine attempting to fight a tidal wave. With guns. And mortars. And another tidal wave of your own. And sometimes really big guns. The Creeper is a living liquid that makes Tiberium look like a small chemical spill. It's coming for you from all sides and directions. It cares not for the small base you've built, only for consuming everything.\n\nSo dig in. In some levels you'll have to do this quite literally, as terraforming is a tool at your disposal. In some levels you'll be hanging on by a thread, almost consumed the second your power goes down to build that reactor you need to expand. In other levels, you will actively hate the liquid that is all set to consume everything you've worked so hard to create.\n\nBut you will love every second of this game.\n\nA really unique concept which will keep you entertained for hours on end. Gets a 9.5/10 from me!\n\n\nOne more thing! As mentioned to me in the comments, there is a demo version of the game on Kongregate.

Heute steht er da, der dritte Teil eines Spiels, was f\u00fcr mich die Perfektion in Tower-Defense darstellt. Warum? \nFangen wir von vorn an. Die blauen Creeper breiten sich aus, sie sind dein Feind. Dies passiert schichtenartig, d. h. die blaue Masse breitet sich von einem bestimmten Punkt immer weiter aus und zwar auf verschieden hohen Ebenen. Die vorgegebene Landschaft bestimmt mit ihren Gegebenheiten wann die Creeper bestimmte Orte erreichen. Deine Aufgabe ist es, mit Anti-Creeper, T\u00fcrmen, Bombern und Kanonen dagegen zu halten. Das ganze basiert auf einem Energiesystem welches du dir erst aufbauen musst, es gibt viele Geb\u00e4ude die f\u00fcr deine Infratruktur zust\u00e4ndig sind und ebenso viele Waffen stehen dir zur Verf\u00fcgung. Das ganze macht erst richtig Spa\u00df sobald der Schwierigkeitsgrad etwas angestiegen ist. Keine Mission spielt sich gleich, du musst bei jeder Situation neu entscheiden und strategisch vorgehen, sonst ist das Spiel schnell vorbei.\nDer Clou: Die meisten Waffen sind beweglich, dadurch ist das Schlachtfeld sehr dynamisch. Sp\u00e4ter erh\u00e4lt man ein Geb\u00e4ude das Upgrades freischaltet, z. B. lassen sich Feuerrate und Reichweite der Waffen erh\u00f6hen oder der Energiespeicher ausbauen. \n\nIch bin aktuell bei Level 20 von 50, obendrein bietet das Spiel Online-Support und Spieler k\u00f6nnen ihre eigenen Level erstellen und hochladen. Die Grafik ist stimmig und Effekte werden stilvoll in Szene gesetzt. Der Soundtrack verdient hier eine besondere Erw\u00e4hnung, dieser ist zwar nicht dynamisch an das Geschehen angepasst, aber durchaus atmosph\u00e4risch und verleiht einem das Gef\u00fchl man w\u00fcrde f\u00fcr eine gro\u00dfe Sache k\u00e4mpfen.\n\nMissionen dauern teilweise bis zu 45 Minuten und erfordern viel Geschick, mal eben schnell in 10 Minuten eine Mission zu spielen ist nicht so einfach.\n\nIch kann jedem, der etwas f\u00fcr Tower-Defense Games sowie Strategie \u00fcbrig hat, nur empfehlen mal einen Blick auf Creeper World III zu werfen.", "timestamp_created": 1403778014, "timestamp_updated": 1403778014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10821813": {"recommendationid": "10821813", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975291291", "num_games_owned": 700, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510385150}, "language": "english", "review": "I picked this game up one afternoon during the summer sale and started playing.\n\nWhen I stopped, it was shortly before sunrise.\n\nSo it's rather successful by that measure. It's quite satisfying to take back ground from the creeper, and when one word is safe, jump right into the next. One more level. I don't think I've played the other Creeper World games, but it feels like after years of making them they've got a pretty good handle on what makes a Creeper World game work in that regard.\n\nI've just finished the main [u]Arc Eternal[/u] campaign, after 27 hours. (I play defensively and pause a lot. Your mileage may vary.) The campaign is pretty good at making each level just a little different, providing some new element of challenge and giving you a new ability to use. Some levels are more different than others.\n\nThe game's weakest moments, I think, are the maps that become simply an ocean of creeper. Any distinctive features of the terrain are all but lost under the sea, as you slowly entrench and advance. Maybe more aggressive tactics could prevent ending up in that situation, but since I wasn't actually [i]losing[/i] those battles, I didn't give up and try different techniques. Then came along a different map that makes things interesting again.\n\nThis isn't the sort of game you play for the story. Yet there is a story, told in bits of dialog at the beginning and ending of levels, which shows some significant thought has gone into the lore of the Creeper. I might have appreciated it more if I was familiar with the other games, but it provides some interesting atmosphere.\n\nI can't comment on the other content outside the main campaign, but there seems to be a lot of it, with a strong focus on giving the community powerful tools to make more.\n\nI played this on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04). Everything ran great there; the only hitch I found is that after switching out of the window with Alt-Tab, I had to hit Alt again after returning to the game to get the keyboard input recognized correctly.\n\nTo sum up: Surely not everyone likes this style of game. But if you're interested in this sort of thing (which you likely are, if you're looking into the reviews), I recommend it without reservation. It's an excellent implementation of the idea.\n\nAnd also very good if you want to forget to eat or sleep.", "timestamp_created": 1403758512, "timestamp_updated": 1403760229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507793", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10820469": {"recommendationid": "10820469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012181065", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463964311}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the game that... well I don't even know what to say about it.

J'avais ensuite zapp\u00e9 le num\u00e9ro 2. Pour ce troisi\u00e8me Creeper World, j'ai retrouv\u00e9 tout ce que j'avais aim\u00e9 auparavant malgr\u00e9 les nombreux ajouts. C'est un RTS de science-fiction o\u00f9 vous devez combattre du creeper, un sorte d'entit\u00e9 fluide qui ne cesse de se propager et qui d\u00e9truit tout \u00e0 son contact.\n\nLe jeu propose une campagne (environ 30 heures pour en venir \u00e0 bout), un \u00e9diteur, des cartes d'autres joueurs, une section \"Tormented Space\" avec des maps tr\u00e8s difficiles \u00e0 impossibles, des mondes g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s al\u00e9atoirement et j'en passe. Il manque juste les parties multi-joueurs, mais comme je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re jouer en solo, ce n'est pas vraiment un probl\u00e8me \u00e0 mes yeux.\n\nLes graphismes peuvent sembler assez basiques, mais, d\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re partie, cette simplicit\u00e9 permet de rapidement rep\u00e9rer chaque unit\u00e9 ou type de b\u00e2timent. Une fois concentr\u00e9 sur la strat\u00e9gie, j'en oublie compl\u00e8tement ces repr\u00e9sentations \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires. Le seul petit probl\u00e8me est de distinguer les zones envahies pas le creeper, celles o\u00f9 se trouve l'anti-creeper (g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 par certaines de nos armes) et les zones d'influence des collecteurs de ressources. Il est possible de changer les couleurs du creeper et de l'anti-creeper, mais je ne suis pas r\u00e9ellement arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 trouver une bonne combinaison de teintes.\n\nLa prise en main est ais\u00e9e. Personnellement, je n'utilise que la souris et deux touches du clavier. La touche \"Espace\" pour d\u00e9s\u00e9lectionner une unit\u00e9 et \"P\" pour mettre le jeu en pause. La fonction pause est essentielle car l'on peut donner des ordres pr\u00e9cis comme la construction de b\u00e2timents ou le d\u00e9placement d'unit\u00e9s. Sans cette possibilit\u00e9, il serait tr\u00e8s difficile (surtout sur les larges cartes) de jouer au vu de toute la micro-gestion indispensable au bon d\u00e9roulement d'une partie.\n\nLe jeu est en anglais uniquement, mais les textes sont peu nombreux et courts. Parfois lors de la campagne, il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de comprendre comment fonctionne la carte propos\u00e9e gr\u00e2ce aux dialogues qui peuvent apporter des indices pr\u00e9cieux.\n\nJ'ai beau chercher, il m'est impossible de trouver de gros d\u00e9faut \u00e0 ce jeu passionnant et plaisant.

It is by far the best of the Creeper World trilogy, all of which were highly enjoyable.

The incredibly far future setting is complemented superbly by the details and artifacts strewn across the many worlds.  Its practically awe-inspiring.\n\nAnother thing I have to say about the game is that the design and coding is perfect - I never found a single bug, and was extremely pleased by all the things I could do with the interface that I wished I could have done in the predecessors.

This is the first game I've bought in a long time at full price,  and it's worth every penny.\n\nCreeper World 3 is a pausable RTS-type game with aspects of tower defense at its core, combined with a physics/fluid dynamics twist. The game is very well done, challenging and packed with a number of game modes, along with a powerful integrated editor. It's not ridiculously complicated with dozens of units or a mad clickfest where you need millisecond reaction times to survive -- those games are not really my style, but Creeper World 3 is very satisfying. It can get hectic, but there's always time to pause and breathe.\n\nTerrain (including terraforming), energy networks and advancing your weaponry all play huge roles, and you will definitely be pondering strategies on every map. This is not a puzzler, there's not a single \"right way\" to win each map; given enough time, often times even poor strategies can grind out wins. That translates to a lot of flexibility and support for different playstyles and setups.\n\nAs the title suggests, this is the third entry in the series, so there's a level of polish and streamlining over the previous titles. There are a huge number of community-created maps, variable-driven procedurally generated maps, and advanced scripting options available in the editor to create a large variety of scenarios beyond just basic maps. You could basically play this game for the rest of your life and always see new content.

I saw this on Steam and I instantly knew I had to buy it. Plays just like the first Creeper World, on an overhead view of the map. If you've played Creeper World 2: Academy online, you'll have some of, if not all of what you need to know about the characters in this game. The story is pretty entertaining, I found myself wanting to play more every time I finished a mission. \n\nIf you're one of those people that couldn't care less about the story of a game, and only care about the gameplay itself, it's got more that what you could ever possibly want. The amount of levels in this game are enough to last you for a loooong time. Each level is different, each one is difficult, and each one forces you to think about how you'll need to start. Sometimes you'll be cornered, sometimes surrounded, and sometimes you won't even have a lot of time to prepare. You would start off in an area with a high wall that has holes in it, and the creeper is advancing from all around you, you can only seal off a few of the holes. In some levels you won't have much time before you're overwhelmed, and in some you might need to use different strategies. This game will have surprises in store for you if you're new to it's universe and gameplay.\n\nAs for the levels, I have yet to put even a small dent into the other sectors, as they contain probably hundreds of more challenging, and maybe even impossible levels. Even with the story missions, as I progressed through them I found myself taking almost an hour to beat them. This will be a time consumer. And on top of the other sectors, there is also the DMD, which is basically loaded with user created maps. So if you somehow manage to top every single level with the game, there's plenty more where that came from.\n\nIf you've played Creeper World before, you will definitely love this game. It's all of the original gameplay loaded with levels, some new tools, a map creator, and, in my opinion, a story that will leave you wanting to continue and find out what happens next.\n", "timestamp_created": 1401559978, "timestamp_updated": 1401559978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510821", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10298722": {"recommendationid": "10298722", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969264127", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1400986031}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun for a while", "timestamp_created": 1401540736, "timestamp_updated": 1401540736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477178", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10296571": {"recommendationid": "10296571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006403739", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 23591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511591666}, "language": "english", "review": "Worthy Game.

I am very pleased that I fall outside of that group because it is a terrific game. The basic mechanics are all easy to understand, shooting the creeper makes it decrease in level, creeper moves like a fluid (though I've heard it's simulated more like heat. But for all gameplay purposes you can think of it like a viscous fuid) to fill in gaps, you need to send out packets made from energy to supply turrets, construction and other things. \nThen as these gameplay elements start to overlap the interactions between them get more complex. I won't go into too much detail but there is a special type of terrain that promotes the creeper to flow along it. This may completely throw what you were doing previously because suddenly you have to be cautious with the fact that it is much harder to clear the creeper.\nThe main draw of the game to me was the resource management system though, which forces you to manage between the space needed to get energy, how much you can afford to defend with that energy, and how you can expand from there. It is very easy to find you've just spent half an hour gradually shifting around units to allow you to push forwards, but all of that time feels engaging.\n\nOverall it's a very engaging game and at \u00a312 it's decently priced for the amount of gameplay contained within.", "timestamp_created": 1400443069, "timestamp_updated": 1400443069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490196", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10158398": {"recommendationid": "10158398", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124503264", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 36573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513443928}, "language": "german", "review": "Es ist ein Spiel.", "timestamp_created": 1400413277, "timestamp_updated": 1400413277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10143906": {"recommendationid": "10143906", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982993818", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467476148}, "language": "english", "review": "Love love love it!", "timestamp_created": 1400298597, "timestamp_updated": 1400298597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10141030": {"recommendationid": "10141030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079324266", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 86, "last_played": 1515731136}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome If you havent played the originals.

I first found a flash game affixed on the engine used in Creeper World 1, [url=http://www.kongregate.com/games/whiteboardwar/creeper-world-training-sim]Creeper World Training Simulation[/url] on Kongregate, and ever since then I had been searching vigeriously for more Creeper World flash games. Next up was another game created by the engine used for Creeper World 1, [url=http://www.kongregate.com/games/whiteboardwar/creeper-world-evermore]Creeper World: Evermore[/url]. Following up on that, I also discovered [url=http://www.kongregate.com/games/whiteboardwar/creeper-world-user-space]Creeper World: User Space[/url]. Shortly after, I finally found a flash game affixed to the engine Creeper World 2 was made from, [url=http://www.kongregate.com/games/whiteboardwar/creeper-world-2-academy]Creeper World 2: Academy[/url]. I had a lot of fun messing around with the anti-creeper there. Eventually, I learned that there was a Creeper World 3 hidden somewhere on the internet, and I looked everywhere for it. Soon, after visiting [url=http://knucklecracker.com/]Knuckle Cracker's website[/url], I learned that Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal had been Greenlit on STEAM. I rushed to get a STEAM Card from Gamestop, and IMMEDIATELY bought Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal without even a second thought. When I started playing, I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen. Not for one second, not for my mom, not for my dad, not for my brother, not even to marvel at my chihuahua when he was rolling over in my room behind me, trying to get my attention. I could not stop for [b]anyone[/b]. The story is amazingly well put together, and innovation and the quick thinking strategy it forces you to endorse while playing is absolutely indescribably amazing. I [b]couldn't stop playing[/b] No matter how angry I got, or how far I progressed only to have the creeper destroy everything I have built and worked so hard for, [b]I COULD NOT STOP PLAYING!![/b] ....

(This is a review for the trilogy which you can get through links on the developers website for about $25 and includes a Steam key for the third game, which is the only game currently on Steam)\n\nThe Creeper World trilogy are RTS games, with a twist. The enemy is not (most of the time,) a specific unit, but instead a wave of blue goo that must be held/pushed back in order to achieve your goals. There are enemy units later on in the second and third games, but every level will be about beating the goo to some extent. \n\nThe feel of the game is somewhat similar to a tower defense game at times, but not so constrained. Most of your 'units' are emplacements/turrets, albeit ones that can usually be moved when you need them somewhere else. \n\nThe complexity of the game increases throughout the series, (so I would recommend starting weith the first game and playing through the trilogy,) but never felt stale even in the first game. The second game changed the style of the game somewhat, and whilst interesting and fun, it wasnt as engaging as the first game, and fortunately the third game returns to the style of the first. Dont get me wrong though, all three games are good. \n\nThere is a story, but its a minimal affair, a paragraph or two at the start of each mission, sufficient to add a bit of colour, but ultimately nothing to get excited about. \n\nThere are also downloadable demos for each game available on the developers website if you want to have a go and see for yourself. http://knucklecracker.com/ including a web based version of the first game.\n\nSo, any drawbacks? The graphics are simplistic but functional, the same is probably true of the sound effects/music. but I tend to turn it off and listen to a cd anyway. The interface is a bit basic, could do with a bit of love and a bit more control, ie text sizes etc, but other than that, its an RTS and its a good one, with map editors, a lot of missions built in and literally thousands of player generated maps too. \n\nAs such, it is absolutely recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1399523956, "timestamp_updated": 1474329730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10047547": {"recommendationid": "10047547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027017732", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 7437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511423392}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!", "timestamp_created": 1399498983, "timestamp_updated": 1399498983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10035635": {"recommendationid": "10035635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018392946", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510980564}, "language": "english", "review": "Great fun.

There is no blood/gore and as an added bonus, it promotes critical thinking in that you\u2019re forced to tackle maps in a systematic way.

Once you have gotten so far into the story mode, you can unlock access to other Zones, which is where the game truly opens up.\n\nThese Zones have tons of star systems, each with their own collection of planets. Basically, you are free to explore hundreds (if not thousands) of levels of Creeper-fighting goodness. There is also a Map Editor mode in which you can create your own maps to upload to the community. You can also download maps that others have created, and rate them. If all of that [i]still[/i] isn't enough, there is a \"Dial Map\" service, which is a seed-based random map generator. So many potential battlefields..\n\nSo, yeah. Great game.

Unless you played the flash versions- then It's just more of the same, in an extremely good way. Beyond Creeper World's flash-era graphics, midi-era music, and long dialogues of exposition that seem to go on for ages, is a complex fun game that is more than your average tower defense.\n\nI feel like it would almost be putting Creeper World to shame by simply just calling it a tower defense. It's more like it's own unique style of RTS, pitting you against the mysterious force simply called \"The Creeper\" (aka water) that is constantly spreading at an alarming rate. Your goal varies from mission to mission, either a simple one such as \"Get from point A to point B, destroying everything in your way\" to \"activate these 6 thingies, go over here and kill this, and then do a loop formation with your towers and then go....\" etc etc. The game varies it's missions very well, making every planet seem like a distinct new world with it's own gimmick rather than just something thrown in a level generator. The towers are extremely situational, and I actually like this more- there's no \"Jack of all trades\" tower, forcing you to vary your strategy depending on what is happening in front of you.\n\nThis all sounds very complex, and possibly at the later levels it is. But as of writing, I have not completed the first sector as I am taking my time enjoying each level, and it is quite managable. I have not tried the extra features that seem very interesting such as DMD, Colonial Space, and Tormented Space, simply because I do not want to spoil the towers for myself- but these seem all like extremely cool features to add replayability to the already large campaign. DMD Allows you to name a randomly generated map after beating it, allowing other players to play and rate the map and name for themselves. Colonial Space is a sector of space only containing user generated maps, and Tormented Space is full of hard bonus missions.\n\nCreeper World 3: Arc Eternal is a beautiful game so far. It's mediocre graphics might not seem like it's worth 15 dollars at first glance, but this is much, much bigger than one might expect.

I am hooked. Although the videos of the game make it look complicated and mask its true nature, I can assure the reader that it feels like a proper tower defence game. I am a big fan of the StarCraft \"turret defence\" games of old, and I'm particularly enamoured with TD games which allow you to maze. This game may not involve mazing, but you can freely place buildings and \"towers\" anywhere you deem fit. Do not feel dismayed by the lack of monsters and lack of paths. The \"creeper\" (which is the enemy) is a creative way of presenting said enemy. It is much too easy to think of it as StarCraft zerg creep to be honest, and needless to say it is not nice stuff. I feel that this game has been lovingly crafted, and I'm looking forward to the replayability that other reviewers have mentioned.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nYour objective is to defeat the creeper on each world. You do this by building up an energy grid and using that energy to build and maintain various weapons (akin to the traditional TD tower). These weapons can move to a new location as you push the creeper further back, and they can be upgraded at the forge.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nYou use the keyboard and the mouse. All of the buildings, and many actions are linked to hotkeys, and those hotkeys can be rebound. Unfortunately the build menu does not tell you the hotkey when you hover, so you must go into the key bindings menu to discover what the hotkeys are in the first place. However, once you've learned them they are easy to get along with.\n\n[h1]Storyline[/h1]\nThere is a plot in the Arc Eternal galaxy. It is fairly basic, and mostly explains the existence of the creeper. I didn't know what precisely was going to happen, but I certainly had a general idea of what direction the plot was going in. But this isn't the sort of game you play for the plot after all.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nThe music is fun, it's energetic. However it is very repetitive. If I play this in the evening, I go to bed with the music stuck in my head.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe graphics are pleasant and functional. Things seem a tad fuzzy if you zoom in really close, but I personally like to have an overall view of the map and so I don't zoom in close. Otherwise, despite all the layers upon layers of creeper, the game runs quite well for me and is not laggy.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[b]+ [/b]non-traditional tower defence\n[b]+ [/b]free placement and movement of \"towers\"\n[b]+ [/b]can rebind hotkeys\n[b]+ [/b]default hotkeys make sense once learned\n[b]+ [/b]make your own maps and play others' maps (great replayability)\n[b]+ [/b]wide range of difficulty level (depending on map)\n[b]+ [/b]first levels of campaign form a tutorial on how to play\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[b]- [/b]music is repetitive\n[b]- [/b]hotkeys are not immediately obvious\n\n[h1]Help Me Help You[/h1]\n[b]If you did not find this review helpful,[/b] I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn\u2019t helpful for you.

Except instead of fighting against creeps and monsters (which are also in the game but not the main element), you are up against a liquid type enemy which is a complety new experience. It goes off Creeper World 1 and adds CW2 elements and abit of new elements itself to create a great sequel. I reccomend getting 1 and 2 as well. They are an experince not worth missing.\n\nThe experience in this game is new and refreshing. Games can go from afew minutes to even a couple of hours depeding on the map you are on. Each map the creeper is different and so is the terrain. So you have to find a new way to approach it. It include many story missions as well as randomly generated and player designed missions which makes the replayablity of the game so high.\n\nThe game is great for competitve players as well as casual players. Players compete for the best score on a map and i end up replaying a single map many times in order to get a better score. Honestly this game is worth the buy due to its unique tower defence experience. If you are new to the genre and an expericed TD player i highly reccomend this game.

Like others that I have read, I played the first 2, including the extra missions, all on Kongregate and eagerly awaited this third installment. I'm so glad to see it here on steam as the Dev can finally make a decent buck from his amazing efforts!\n\nWhat makes Creeperworld games so unique amongst other tower defence games is the energy currency system. Unlike other games that require you to save your resources, research, etc etc until you can build what you want, you have the ability to build straight away and as many of each structure as you like. The danger lies that the energy required to build, is the same energy required to fire weapons. So if you exhaust too much energy into building, you will surely die! This is balanced by the fact that the more \"collectors\" you spread across the map, the more energy you have, so there is always an incentive to keep building! \n\nAlthough not as graphically amazing as some TD such as Kingdom rush, Giants and Dwarves, etc or even the older Dune 3D, Starcraft, etc, etc it makes up for it in fantastic TD gameplay. The second installment of the series seemed to push for better graphics, though this actually seemed to tear away slightly from the charm of Creeperworld and I am personally glad to see an this version return a bit truer to its roots... With one great advantage... NULLIFIERS!! You can explode those nasty emitters. Something that you dreamed heavily about in the first game. \n\nThere are a bunch of new features in this third game all which so far (I know it's still early for me) are very welcome imrovements. One of the best improvements has to be the TERP that literraly allows you to redraw the level!! No space for that turret...

And I've only (shamefully) played less than 3 hours, BUT I'M QUALIFIED. This game is great :P I wanted my review to be my original thought about the game from looking at the screenshots, which was:\n\n\"What are tho.. Ah, so.. The lines mo.. uh.. Wait, then those bubb, er.. And they.. ? What is tha..\" :P\n\nIn short, this game is about the primal fear of water ruining your cool stuff. Imagine your kitchen. Its awesome. Except now you've decided to catalog your prize comic book collection, THE WHOLE THING. Its going to take a while. The table is\n piled so full that you've had to start making piles on the floor here and there. Suddenly, your child drops a full glass jug of apparently antique milk and it shatters!! *suspenseful music* Now, the antique milk hasn't splashed on your comic \nbooks.. YET!\n\nBut its spreading!! And, lucky you, besides collecting comic books you also design small functional mortars and cannons that fire small liquid-absorbing sponges, all supplied by intricate wiring relays that transport power from a central battery. For the sake of cohesion we'll say you developed the sponge cannons because of your mortifing phobia of dish cloths, also, so you can't just mop the liquid up.. *cough* If you're quick enough, you can set up an intricate web of relays linked to your tiny armada of sponge-launching war-machines aaaall along the kitchen floor in a milk-encircling radius and potentially combat the comic-ruining liquid menace before your precious copy of Jurrasic Park #1 is ruined.\n\nThat's what the game is about. Yep.\n\nIn all seriousness I think its pushing it to call this game a tower defense game.. I tend to reserve that title for games with MUCH less features and elements involved than this, particularly concerning tightly placed pathways. As stated elsewhere, if you have any doubts about purchasing, the first two games are on Kongregate free to play, and there is also a demo of this game on the devs website. But you don't need a demo. Did you need a demo when you decided air was good to breathe? Did you!? ;)\n\nAlso I wanted to mention that til this game showed up on Steam I had no idea it existed, so there is that :> I'm fresh as a daisy to this and can already smell the deep possibilities here and have barely touched the main campaign just yet, but I still hope the dev isn't fully done adding to the main game, especially since its life on Steam has just begun..

It's vaguely reminicesent of tower defense titles, but with an absolutely monstrous, game-defining twist. The enemy is not units, but rather Creeper-goop that covers the map and damages or destroys your structures on contact. The game is to fight back, and then destroy the goop spigots-\"emitters\"- or complete other objectives. The structures and enemies are all very simple and direct in their purpose and utility. The game itself however is extremely various in difficulty based on the map itself-size, features, and the strength of the emitters. There are additional enemies in addition to the emitters but they are not in all maps.  The challenge of the game is all about defending yourself while you build your energy resources up before you push to destroy the emitters. Later, you can redo the maps to attempt to do so faster. \n\nThe game has a great custom map communtiy and a custom map generator after you finish the decently long and challenging campaign. Replayability is top notch.\n\nI've gotten more fun and more hours out of this than a shameful number of AAA titles. All things considered, absolutely amazing for an indie. \n\nI've had no issues with bugs, and the developer has been pretty good with support for those that do find them.\n\nThe only downside is there is no direct multiplayer of any sort.

Have some turrets to keep Creepers at bay. Advance to their Emitter and destroy it with Nullifier(its range is short and takes time to activate, be sure to deal with creepers first).\nIt contains more than thousands of official levels, short maps are finishable within 3 minutes or so, and some epic maps would take 2 or more hours. \nThere's even a leaderboard competes for \"time taken to beat the level\", and some people seem to be really good at finding clever tactics or optimize their moves.\n\nThe game has a built-in map editor and script editor, which allows you to make interesting maps once you know how. I'm hoping to see good levels to play.\n\n12/10, One of the best RTS I played in all the time. I played all the 3 series of Creeper World, and love it best.\n\n--------------------------------\n\u6db2\u4f53\u72b6\u306e\u6575\u300c\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u300d\u3068\u6226\u3046RTS\u3002\u7dd1\u8272\u306e\u7206\u767a\u3059\u308b\u7686\u306e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3002\n\n\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306f\u6bd4\u8f03\u7684\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u3002\u300c\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u300d\u3092\u5efa\u3066\u3066\u30a8\u30cd\u30eb\u30ae\u30fc\u4f9b\u7d66\u3068\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u3001\u5404\u7a2e\u7832\u53f0\u3067\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u3068\u6226\u3046\u3002\u3069\u3093\u3069\u3093\u524d\u7dda\u3092\u62bc\u3057\u9032\u3081\u3066\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u306e\u767a\u751f\u6e90\u3067\u3042\u308b\u300c\u30a8\u30df\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u300d\u3092\u7834\u58ca\u3059\u308b(\u305f\u3060\u3057\u7834\u58ca\u3067\u304d\u308b\u300c\u30cc\u30ea\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u300d\u306f\u5efa\u8a2d\u306b\u6642\u9593\u304c\u304b\u304b\u308b\u4e0a\u306b\u8106\u3044\u306e\u3067\u3001\u767a\u52d5\u307e\u3067\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3068\u5b88\u308b\u3053\u3068)\u3002\n\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u306f\u516c\u5f0f\u3067\u7528\u610f\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3082\u306e\u3060\u3051\u3067\u3082\u6570\u5343\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3042\u308a\u3001\uff13\u5206\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3067\u7d42\u308f\u308b\u5c0f\u578b\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u304b\u3089\u6570\u6642\u9593\u304b\u3051\u3066\u653b\u7565\u3059\u308b\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u3084\u898f\u6a21\u306e\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u307e\u3067\u30d0\u30e9\u30a8\u30c6\u30a3\u306f\u8c4a\u5bcc\u3002\n\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u6642\u9593\u3092\u7af6\u3046\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u3042\u308a\u3001\u4e0a\u4f4d\u306e\u30b9\u30b3\u30a2\u306e\u7570\u5e38\u306a\u901f\u3055\u306f\u6226\u7565\u306e\u81ea\u7531\u3055\u3068\u52b9\u7387\u5316\u306e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3092\u8a9e\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b(\u30c1\u30fc\u30c8\u306e\u7dda\u3082\u5426\u3081\u306a\u3044\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u3063\u3066\u306e\u3082\u3042\u308b\u304c)\u3002\n\n\u3042\u3068\u30de\u30c3\u30d7/\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30d7\u30c8\u30a8\u30c7\u30a3\u30bf\u3082\u540c\u68b1\u3067\u3001\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u516c\u958b\u3001\u4ed6\u8005\u306e\u30de\u30c3\u30d7\u3092\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u8a55\u4fa1\u3067\u304d\u308b\u6a5f\u80fd\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3002\u3053\u308c\u304b\u3089\u306e\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u306b\u671f\u5f85\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3002\n\n\u500b\u4eba\u7684\u70b9\u6570\u306f12/10\u3002\u300c\u6700\u9ad8\u306eRTS\u300d\u3068\u805e\u304b\u308c\u305f\u3089\u6319\u3052\u3089\u308c\u305d\u3046\u306a\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u3002\uff13\u4f5c\u3068\u3082\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6e08\u307f\u3060\u304c\u3001\uff13\u3092\u4e00\u756a\u85a6\u3081\u305f\u3044\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1395961037, "timestamp_updated": 1396044420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558248", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9647390": {"recommendationid": "9647390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004231107", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1918, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460666464}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has truly unlimited content.

Don't share it.\n\nFinally, if you are creative, inventive and perhaps you like to add custom units and styles, make your own map in the Projects Editor and share it in Colonial Space.

It's a game that blurs the already murky lines between RTS, TBS, and Tower Defense. It's real time, but you can pause at any point and queue up a hundred actions. It features a mindless, overwhelming enemy, but it's you who has to go on the offensensive against them, some have described it as a tower offense game.\n\nThe core mechanics are nice and tight. Creep functions in slightly different ways on each map, so you may need a restart or two per world to ascertain the best line of action, but this only adds to the enjoyment. It's rare that you feel like you're simply overpowering the enemy, more, you have to outsmart the map. Slight alterations in how resources are distributed and the exact positioning of emitters, subspace slips, digitalis trails, runner spawns, air denial zones, and BLOODY SPORES mean every map requires a unique strategy, not to mention how the game's decently sized campaign features a number of levels with fun, unique gimmicks, such as the creep rolling around the map, periodically overwhelming your defenses, to trying to defend a base about to be DP'd by two tidal waves of the stuff. Some gimmicks do feel a bit cheaper than others, in some missions the exposition will tell you \"do X, if Y happens you'll fail\", but then it turns out that X was impossible or you can't prevent Y. It's an annoying tweest the first time around, but after that the levels are fine.\n\nThe story is very take-it-or-leave-it. I haven't played either of the originals, but the story seemed to be internally confused in ways the originals wouldn't have helped. The ending is very underwhelming in every sense of the word, personally I thought Farbor was the best level in the game (this is a very controversial level) and would have made a much better finale. Still, it's perfectly fine to simply ignore the story, the gameplay is more than 100 times enough to cover it.\n\nI'm not saying it's for everyone, this is a very slow paced RTS, as previously mentioned it encourages constant pausing and a few resets to figure out the level, and your level of micro is very limited, but speed nuts will still have a blast as there is a slight online competitive element to see how fast you can beat the level, although if all these results of 6 seconds aren't bugged I'll eat my hat. What I'm saying is it's not starcraft 2, it'd be more of a spellforce pace on an easy, large map without pausing.\n\nAfter the excellent campaign, there is plenty more fun to be had. You can play a variety of premade maps in further, non-story paths, and there is both TWO procedural map generators, AND a highly in-depth custom map maker with built-in sharing to boot. (In-depth to the degree where some cutom maps let you play as the creep, somehow.)\n\nOverall, if you'd like an engrossing, fun indie RTS where the levels feel more like puzzles than Clicks Per Second races, and the novelty of fighting a liquid (it never gets old) you should definitley give this a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1516419351, "timestamp_updated": 1516419351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39601092": {"recommendationid": "39601092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019668004", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510934312}, "language": "english", "review": "Keep up the good work !\n\nCan't wait to see the next one !", "timestamp_created": 1516872892, "timestamp_updated": 1516872892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39596367": {"recommendationid": "39596367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181148186", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 619, "last_played": 1516850084}, "language": "english", "review": "I keep playing this game but I continue to not have fun playing it.

But the scenario definitely lacked stakes.  Getting to the end you can see the fairly high-concept SF explanation for it all, but along the way it definitely didn't pass the \"what's the point of doing this exactly?\" test, and even the end felt very weak in terms of what the 'right' or 'good' outcome was and why.\n\nI loved the concept of the Creeper battles, and they do provide some interesting challenges to work out which of the many tools to use, and how to juggle the initial resource constraints.  However, there is a somewhat systematic problem with these levels where the strategy, challenge, fun, are all really only in the first few minutes.  Pretty much every level, with only a few exceptions in the crucial story missions, revolve around a scramble to stabilize your foothold and then it just devolves into a fairly dull and repetitive mopping up exercise.  This seems like something that could have been handled by adding in more escalation mechanisms to actually maintain the possibility of failure, and a reason to keep striving, after the initial few minutes.\n\nSure, there's an overall time that you might want to improve on by being more efficient in your initial landgrab and how quickly you can organize the mopping up, but that's hardly any motivation at all.  Not least because the registered leaderboard of times is complete nonsense - clearly people worked out how to cheat/hack this a long time ago, and the leaderboards are filled with impossible (a few seconds) times to solve the maps.  A simple 'gold' 'silver' 'bronze' ranking with pre-calculated typical expected times might have been better here if they couldn't ensure the integrity of the reported player results.\n\nThe upgrade system is also a bit ... binary.  Any given level changes dramatically based upon access to the upgrade resource.  Once you get it, you can radically change the capability of all your units provided you can keep things stabilized for long enough - which, without much escalation, is usually the case.  It seems like there are more interesting ways of handling this - have, say, the number of totems you control determine the maximum upgrade level you can achieve, eg.  Perhaps the underused siphon concept was supposed to provide some measure of this by giving you a preset finite amount of various resources, but they never really used this effectively in my opinion.\n\nThe UI is ok, but not great.  I wasn't a fan of how the targetting of units was affected by what you were controlling.  I found myself reflexively hitting the 'Cancel' button way too often just so that I could be sure when I clicked on something I was going to be controlling that thing.\n\nBut yeah, a good concept executed competently.  I enjoyed working through the core story.  Once that was done there are a lot of effectively user generated worlds with varying degrees of curation, but I don't find much motivation to keep plugging away at them for the reasons described above.  Not so much replayability either, but perhaps a casual world played every now and then when I'm bored ... maybe.\n", "timestamp_created": 1519484794, "timestamp_updated": 1519484794, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40349623": {"recommendationid": "40349623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021742638", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517839498}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc5bc\ud54f \ubcf4\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \uc0bc\ub958 \ud50c\ub798\uc2dc \uac9c\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc\n\uc5c4\uccad\ub09c \uc911\ub3c5\uc131\uacfc \ubbf8\uc158\ud074\ub9ac\uc5b4\uc758 \ucf8c\uac10\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4..\n\ud0c0\uc784\ud0ac\ub9c1\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ucc9c\ud558\ub294 \uac8c\uc784", "timestamp_created": 1519459611, "timestamp_updated": 1519459611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40347779": {"recommendationid": "40347779", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055196015", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1093, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437593146}, "language": "english", "review": "\u27a4Playability\n\u2611 Singleplayer\n\u2610 Multiplayer\n\n\u27a4Graphics:\n\u2610 What graphics?\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\n\u2622 While the graphics aren't the most complex, they fit the style great.\n\n\n\u27a4Price/Quality:\n\u2610 Avoid\n\u2610 Wait for Sale\n\u2610 Full Price\n\u2611 Pre-Ordered\n\u2610 Take my money!\n\n\u2622 I have played the other two versions, and this one is just as good as the others.\n\u2622 For those on a budget, I would say wait for a sale, but who knows when that will be?\n\n\n\u27a4Difficulty:\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Medium\n\u2611 Hard\n\u2610 Insane\n\u2610 Put me out of my misery!\n\n\u27a4Game Length\n\u2610 0 - 4 hours\n\u2610 4 - 10 hours\n\u2611 10 - 20 hours\n\u2610 20+ hours\n\u2610 I can't find the ending!\n\n\u2622 This game can take a while if you're bad at strategy, but it's still super fun.\n\n\u27a4Story\n\u2610 There was a story?\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Fantastic\n\u2610 Glorious\n\n\u27a4Other Notes:\n\u2622 This was a game I played when I was younger, and it has a bit of charm that's hard to find in games nowadays.\n\n\u27a4Final Verdict:\n\u2622 Worth the buy! 126% Worth it.\n( 19Hrs / $15 = 1.26 x 100% = 126% )", "timestamp_created": 1519453962, "timestamp_updated": 1519453962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503275", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40342730": {"recommendationid": "40342730", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001811105", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "last_played": 1521247636}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is fun and addicting, but is somewhat on the easy side.

Once you're nearly halfway through a mission, it gets impossible to lose. The round becomes a test of patience, as the player can only wait and proceed to destorying more of the creeper, that is until the goal is reached. It's not so much of a problem for players who enjoy beating time-related records however.\n\nAs the player gets stronger, the creeper sticks with the same difficulty within the map. It's the only aspect I wasn't too fond of after about reaching the 10-15 hour mark into the game. What would be great is a mechanic that lets emitters release more creeper exponentially as the time progresses. Maybe a lower viscosity for the creeper could work when it has many layers. I'm sure there could be a way to keep the difficulty consistent throughout the level.\n\nAside from that, I had great fun playing this and there were indeed smaller maps that had me challenged, and it's still an addicting strategy game that I'd recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1519435456, "timestamp_updated": 1519436294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40332475": {"recommendationid": "40332475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004595765", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 26253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 171, "last_played": 1521735149}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ubb38\uba85\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354\ud55c \uc911\ub3c5\uc131, \ud55c\ubc88 \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uba74 \uc9c4\uc9dc \uc2dc\uac04 \uac00\ub294\uc904 \ubaa8\ub974\ub294 \uac8c\uc784", "timestamp_created": 1519405117, "timestamp_updated": 1519405117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40297950": {"recommendationid": "40297950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261118522", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 117, "last_played": 1521726065}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is well made and it doesn't lag\nIt's kind of like a tower defense game but you fight goo and there is a great variety of \nguns/tower/other things. \n", "timestamp_created": 1519298215, "timestamp_updated": 1519298215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547038", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40277480": {"recommendationid": "40277480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043002927", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463144657}, "language": "english", "review": "If you always liked Strategy games where you could turtle to win then this game is definetly something you will enjoy.\nIt is also a game that you can easily play while doing something else, like listening to podcasts, etc.\nUnfortunately it gets a bit boring and repetitive after a while, so in order for the playtime to be worth the money i'd say, wait until it's on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1519223861, "timestamp_updated": 1519223861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40276998": {"recommendationid": "40276998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023263832", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519195931}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is far more difficult than the free versions on kongregate.

I loved those games for several reasons:\n\n(1) good and original (somewhat original) story; and the story fit with the gameplay, as in it didn't feel like it was just there for the sake of being there.\n(2) Gameplay itself was somewhat unique and had it's own style\n(3) It was a free-to-play flash based game, so the constrains of a flash game was present and I could forgive some of the UI shortcomings. Also, it was free, obviously.\n\nWhen I purchased Creeper World 3 I didn't expect the best story or gameplay, but I expected either a mediocre story or no story at all. If you can only provide a story for your game that makes players want to punch something, then forget the story. The previous games showed that humanity was able to make shields and weapons to defeat the creeper and the story starts off with... billions of years have passed but humanity couldn't find a way to win and was wiped out, except for you, who was kept in cryo for all this time. I guess in case humanity needed your skills again. Your protagonist even calls out the rubbish story by responding, \"Why didn't you wake me before humanity was exterminated?\" and gets no response. On a side note, this trope in games and Hollywood is extremely irritating, there is always some ancient weapon/being/extinct race that was able to invent far better tech than we modern day imbeciles could ever hope to comprehend or recreate, far less improve upon. I guess the ancient Egyptians were using brain implanted communication devices while we, 5,000 years later can only create cell phones with clunky touch screens.\n\nThe gameplay has not been improved (although I was too bored to even play through the whole campaign), the maps are not as good as the first two games, there is no graphical improvement, and the UI is not improved. If you are going to sell the game on steam and not have it as a free-to-play flash browser game, then at least implement a better UI.

An RTS/tower defense where your enemy is, essentially, a massive fluid simulation? I had to give it a try.\n\nIt turned out to be even more fun than it looked. This game is seriously addicting, especially if you enjoy playing RTSs in a turtling defensive style like I do. Each level features one or more Emitters, which periodically (usually very quickly) emit a small amount of a fluid substance called Creeper, which flows around like a very viscous liquid. If it touches your building it will either hurt them (most of the active tower units) or destroy them outright (most of the passive energy collectors). You goal is simple: build up a base, push back the Creeper, and ultimately destroy any Emitters on the map (along with other kinds of things that spawn other enemies on some levels).\n\nThe game has a lot of depth to it, and does a fantastic job of introducing it through the story mode. Seriously, these are some very done tutorial levels: each one introduces one or at most two new features, and requires you to use and understand them in order to beat it. Then later levels add more and more things until you're effortlessly juggling a base with over a score of different building types in it. More games could stand to introduce their mechanics this well.\n\nI could gush on and on about the specifics, but let me briefly mention some of the things that make this different from most RTS and tower defense games. As mentioned, you're essentially fighting an ever-spawning wave of liquid, so you don't need to worry about unpredictable AI causing you trouble\u2014it's easy to predict how the Creeper will evolve at any moment in time and you can act accordingly. You also don't really have a large divide between units and buildings. Most of your active defense buildings can be picked up and moved anytime you want, allowing you push your frontlines forward by recycling buildings from the rear\u2014no more fields of towers left forlornly behind as you advance. There aren't really any RTS-style units in the game anyway (you can get a few kinds of aircraft that can be moved liked units, but they're all tied to their own individual launchpads), so your active towers kind of take their place. It's an interesting and fun system in practice.\n\nThere are a lot of little things that this game just gets right. I've mentioned how well the tutorial is built into the story missions and how well it teaches you the various mechanics bit by bit. The music is also very good, though there admittedly isn't very much of it and might start to get a bit samey after a few hours. I wish there was more. The story I've also found surprisingly interesting and engaging so far, despite not having played either of the previous two games in the series, which take place in the same continuity I believe.\n\nAll in all I can heartily recommend this as a tower defense/RTS game that takes the good elements from both but mixes them into something completely unique and incredibly compelling. I'm almost ten hours in and still working my way through the story mode campaign, and there are both procedurally-generated and user-created levels afterwards as the game allows you to create your own levels as well. Truly well-worth the asking price and a steal on sale, and I expect to get many hours of brow-furrowed enjoyment out of this game in the future.\n\nOh yes, and another thing it gets right is that it works flawlessly for me on Linux (Debian testing) so far.

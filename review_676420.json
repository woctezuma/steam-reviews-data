The game has a very simple design, and absolutely NO INSTRUCTIONS.  That's not a bad thing, because you are thrust into puzzle after puzzle and have to figure out how things work.

Some levels introduce new mechanics, and then the next levels put them together with what you already know in strange and unexpected ways.\n\nThe main joy for Me in this game (and in life) is figuring things out.  There seem to be some videos on YouTube showing exactly how to play the game and get through every puzzle.  I didn't watch any of them and downvoted the link to them on Steam.  I certainly don't recommend them to anyone.

From truly great level designs to soothing music scores, SiNKR excels at incorporating the constituent elements of its genre into the fabric of its gameplay. Offering a relaxed experience with no timers or move counters, SiNKR allows players to lavish their full attention onto the puzzle facing them. SiNKR also nails the difficulty progression of its levels, starting out slow but quickly working its way to simultaneously being complicated and fun. At its current price of $1, SiNKR is a great value and is definitely worth playing.\n\nSiNKR opens very slowly, allowing players time to adjust to the game\u2019s mechanics. The gameplay is revealed to center around moving pucks into holes using hooks. The hooks only move in one direction and cannot return to their original positions once they have been reeled in close to the holes, which serves as the operative limiting factor that makes the game challenging. Some holes take more than one puck to fill, while all hooks are able to collect more than one puck at any given moment. While those with completionist tendencies do not need to worry about succeeding in a certain finite number of moves, all players must be strategic or else they will have to redo the puzzles.\n\nThe aspect of the puzzler that really shines is its great, handcrafted level design. SiNKR really succeeds in striking a balance between stimulating and frustrating players. Whenever players figure out a creative solution to a level, they are immediately gratified by the effort that they put in. SiNKR feels smart and really encourages exploration within its individual levels.\n\nThe game mechanics become more sophisticated as players progress through the levels. While they begin by just being able to pull on hooks, soon players gain the abilities to horizontally or vertically flip the side of the hook and to connect hooks together. Linking hooks allows players to advance their hooks to parts of the levels previously inaccessible due to their original positioning, adding initially unexpected flavor to SiNKR. The game never allows for a mechanic to become stale or monotonous, instead introducing new ones before players have the chance to grow disinterested.\n\nThe music that is played in the background of each level really enhances the gaming experience. It encapsulates the tranquil yet thought-provoking feel that is at the essence of the SiNKR. The ambient music fits perfectly with the niche that SiNKR fills, really elevating the game.\n\nEven though SiNKR only takes between one and two hours to complete, it is really worth investing in. The thought put into each level is readily apparent, making players utilize visual as opposed to textual learning to become accustomed to new gameplay mechanics. Full controller support and touch screen compatibility only further enhance a great game. SiNKR is worth picking up, and that is reflected in its score of 8/10.\n\nRating: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1510658257, "timestamp_updated": 1510658257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481928", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36501550": {"recommendationid": "36501550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198444456848", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510789725}, "language": "english", "review": "Glad to have Sinkr on my laptop/tablet.

En effet, il nous faut r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir (\"[i]to think[/i]\" en anglais, pour les deux du fond qui dormaient pendant les cours) afin de venir \u00e0 bout de la soixantaine de niveaux qu'il compte. Et je vous saurais gr\u00e9 de ne pas \u00eatre d\u00e9sobligeants en pointant du doigt cette prononciation si d\u00e9licieuse qui m'a fait amalgamer, peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 tort, [i]sinkr[/i] et [i]thinker[/i]. Bref. Voil\u00e0 un jeu qui pousse \u00e0 la r\u00e9flexion sans jamais devenir frustrant, malgr\u00e9 l'absence de fonction permettant d'annuler nos actions. Autant dire que les chances pour que vous vous fassiez un n\u0153ud au cerveau restent plut\u00f4t maigres.\n\nPour autant, les une ou deux heures de jeu qu'il propose ne sont pas d\u00e9nu\u00e9es d'int\u00e9r\u00eat. Si son c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e9pur\u00e9, son ambiance relaxante et l'impression qu'il donne au premier abord lui conf\u00e8rent un certain air de famille avec [i][b]Hook[/b][/i], on s'aper\u00e7oit toutefois tr\u00e8s vite que son gameplay est diff\u00e9rent. Ici, l'objectif est de faire glisser un ou plusieurs palets, carr\u00e9s ou circulaires, jusqu'aux emplacements correspondants ; \u00e0 ce d\u00e9tail pr\u00e8s qu'un palet circulaire peut entrer dans un emplacement carr\u00e9, mais pas l'inverse. Emplacements dans lesquels vous devrez par ailleurs envoyer un, deux ou trois palets, selon le nombre de bandes concentriques qui les constituent.\n\nPour ce faire, vous aurez sous la main divers outils. Tout d'abord des crochets, simples ou multiples, qui changeront de position en un clic, mais qui ne se d\u00e9placent que dans un seul sens ; \u00e0 moins bien s\u00fbr que vous ne parveniez, avec un peu d'astuce, \u00e0 les tracter dans l'autre. Ensuite des fl\u00e8ches, dont la vocation se r\u00e9sume \u00e0 r\u00e9orienter les palets, puis des t\u00e9l\u00e9porteurs sur lesquels sont inscrits entre un et quatre points. Pourquoi cette num\u00e9rotation ? C'est tr\u00e8s simple : pour peu qu'il existe deux portails identiques, on entre par l'un pour ressortir par l'autre. Du coup, je vous laisse deviner ce qu'il advient lorsque trois voire quatre de ces portails portent le m\u00eame num\u00e9ro. Enfin, dernier dispositif, un pivot qui redirige les palets, avant de tourner d'un quart de tour, dans un sens d\u00e9fini.\n\nTout ceci fonctionne donc \u00e0 merveille, sans compter que chacun de ces outils - le crochet except\u00e9 - dispose d'une version alternative, version que le joueur pourra configurer \u00e0 loisir et en temps r\u00e9el. Par exemple, on pourra modifier la direction d'une fl\u00e8che, le num\u00e9ro inscrit sur tel ou tel t\u00e9l\u00e9porteur ou enfin le sens de rotation d'un pivot. Au final, les soixante niveaux passent presque trop vite et on se surprend \u00e0 regretter qu'il n'y en ait pas eu davantage. Bon, [i]regretter[/i] est un bien grand mot, dans la mesure o\u00f9 son prix risque peu de vous d\u00e9cevoir.\n\n[h1]Verdict : 4/5 - Tr\u00e8s bon, une valeur s\u00fbre ![/h1]\n\n[code]Vous avez aim\u00e9 cette \u00e9valuation ?

If you like to solve increasingly tricky puzzles to ambient music, then you are certainly in the right place.\n\nThis game is fairly intuitive to understand. It introduces concepts one at a time, increasing the difficulty with each new piece after it does before introducing something new. I had a chance to see this game before, and got to level 45 before stopping to review.\n\nIt works really well if your screen has touch support, even supporting multi-touch on Windows 10 (careful there). While it does have great controller support, I recommend using mouse/touch to make things a little easier. It might be possible to improve controller support by holding a \"modifier\" key (one of the triggers, for example) to change what the directional pad targets when selecting. Two modifiers with two joysticks should cover all the different types (I think six \"categories\" would be enough). Even so, the later stages can get rather busy, so mouse/touch is strongly encouraged.\n\nOverall, SINKR is a wonderful game worth much more than it costs. I strongly recommend picking it up and playing it. According to the developer it takes roughly an hour to complete.

Some of my favorite games (Oxyd, Cyberbox, The Incredible Machine and Lemmings) have one thing in common: They all are rule based manipulation puzzles. SiNKR is right up there with all of them. Using a deceptively simple mechanic, SiNKR provides 60 increasingly challenging puzzles to entertain you with. With each puzzle you learn something new that will then be built upon in the remaining puzzles. In addition to the challenging puzzles, they are presented in a minimalist environment with a pleasing soundtrack that dovetails well with the sounds created by the mechanic itself. There is also no hidden information, which is a technique that I prefer. On some puzzles, you can figure out the solution before making your first move. On later puzzles, you can try to do this...but I found I always overlooked one or two things and had to fail a few times before having the critical \"A-Ha\" moment to help me solve a particular puzzle.

It directly starts with the basics and then increases difficulty by adding new and new elements, always presenting them first, with an intuitive riddle that show how they work.\n\nEssentially you have circles you have to drag into holes by grabbing them with hooks that moves in only one direction through a fixed pattern. That's how it starts though, because after some puzzles new mechanics and elements will be introduced, increasing the articulation and complexity of riddles.\n\nThe only input the game requires is a simple click and this added to the look of the game makes it very tablet/mobile friendly.

It is rather short and I do have some minor gripes with it, but the price is adequate and I enjoyed myself. As long as you don't expect a minimalist puzzle masterpiece I can wholeheartedly recommend this game.\n\n[u]In long[/u]: The basic premise is as simple as it gets: Use hooks to drag pellets into holes. You reel in hooks by holding down large hexagonal buttons, which feels awkward. Some levels depend on very precise sequences and holding a mouse button and releasing it with the right timing didn't feel like intuitive [b][u]controls[/u][/b]. Thankfully everything happens on a grid and a single click advances the hook by a fixed amount, so I mostly ended up clicking my way through the game.\nThere is a total of 60 levels and roughly every 6 levels a new [b][u]mechanic[/u][/b] is introduced. These turned out to be surprisingly interesting and some of them give you a lot of freedom in approaching levels as you can set up holding loops and redirect portals for instance. I didn't mind that a few levels required timing, as the windows were pretty generous. There definitely is some interesting and innovative stuff happening here and providing a good amount of variety, but some interactions are a bit wonky. I've never figured out how to reliably tell which of two overlapping hooks would grab a pellet, and it can get pretty hard to click the right thing in a crowded area, but thankfully those drawbacks very rarely come up.\nAll these mechanics are very gently introduced, which on the flipside means there's at least 2 very easy tutorial stages every ~6 levels and as such the [b][u]difficulty[/u][/b] is more like a rollercoaster than a progression. The levels are arranged in blocks by the spotlighted mechanic and only some of the new features are kept for later stages. Sometimes it feels like once you've become familiar with a new mechanic the game already moves on - more like a proof of concept rather than a game. There definitely is no filler levels to be found here. Still, there are some decently challenging levels where you do have to plan ahead instead of mindlessly brute-forcing your way through it. This is further encouraged by the complete lack of an undo mechanic. The game is still very much approachable, but not completely casual. Those harder levels are where much of my enjoyment of the game came from. Still, without much of a rush, I completed all 60 levels in just 75 minutes. I would have enjoyed a little more content, but I can also see myself going back to SiNKR in a few years.\n\nVisually the game looks fine. The [b][u]graphics[/u][/b] and animations are pretty simple, but I wouldn't go so far as call them minimalist (per the stated design intention on the store page) and it's certainly not a clean aesthetic. The screen actually felt pretty crowded with the background grid lighting up and pellets in hooks having yellow stripes and the many elements of the larger levels. And I really didn't like the graphical effect upon resetting a level - to me it always felt out of place and jarring. The [b][u]sounds[/u][/b] are pretty good and the music is non-intrusive enough that I only turned it down, not off (which I usually do in puzzle games).\n\nOn the [b][u]technical[/u][/b] side, the game launched in a weird low resolution 4:3 in full screen. Due to the buttons and options being a bit cryptic (minimalist aesthetic is fine, but a few tool-tips would go a long way) it took a bit to figure out, but in the end all the customizations I wanted worked (windowed mode, resolution, volume sliders). The initial loading time feels a bit long and if you click during it you can cause the loading screen to freeze/break (only visually). Other than that I never encountered any technical problems or glitches.\n\nI can't say I was blown away by SiNKR, but it did have some neat ideas showing innovation and potential for a more fleshed-out game down the road. It's a solid puzzle game that to me feels entirely adequately priced for its short length. I did enjoy my time with it and can recommend you pick it up if puzzle games interest you.", "timestamp_created": 1518109652, "timestamp_updated": 1518109652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469799", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39919264": {"recommendationid": "39919264", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991785034", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517990252}, "language": "english", "review": "SiNKR is a brief but entertaining puzzle game.\n \nEach level feels well designed and the solutions feel very intuitive to find.

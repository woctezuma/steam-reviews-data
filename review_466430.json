But playing through the game like I did had the feeling of history in the making, complete with all the qualities I noted. I particularly appreciate that the game is perfunctory in its descriptions of places and people. There is just enough detail to set the scene and you go from there. Only truly professional writers know how to perform the trick of sketching enough of the story to let the mind fill in the rest.\n\nThe best Choice of Games adventures put you in situations with equally rewarding choices where the outcomes are anything but clear. I had a definite goal in mind to change history to the point where our universe's version of Alexandra never came to pass. As it happened, I failed in achieving that goal through a series of unwise choices...and yet I succeeded in changing history in a very unexpected way. I might add that the goal I did achieve came completely by accident, focusing on the individual lives I was affecting rather than the big picture. It all comes to a head in the epilogue, where certain events enshrined by one William Shakespeare can be completely rewritten due to a final set of choices made.\n\nWhile I can acknowledge that such CYOA games are not for everyone, anyone who enjoys such entertainment should definitely check this one out.", "timestamp_created": 1509675109, "timestamp_updated": 1509675109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35736980": {"recommendationid": "35736980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069159152", "num_games_owned": 720, "num_reviews": 460, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508042192}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an amusing, if sometimes tricky, little choose-your-own-adventure novel.

Good.\n\nThis is one of the absolute best, most thought-provoking choose-your-own adventure style text-based games I have ever read/played. Its emphasis on philosophy and the potential long-term consequences of your choices (and the potential endings which result) are extremely interesting and fairly well written. The characters are more complex and the various messages and themes are far deeper than much of the intellectual content found in most graphically intense games which have yet been created. The ethical dilemmas this game presents can be extremely difficult and the results of your actions, while not always easy to predict, make perfect sense in hindsight. \n\nUnlike Champion of the Gods, the genre of this story is not fantasy but alternate history (a somewhat unusual form of sci-fi). This story/game attempts to answer questions of what might have been had people made different decisions to bring about alternate events. What if the great library of Alexandria had not burnt down or fallen into disrepair? What if wisdom from the ancient world had not been largely lost? What if the Alexandrian Empire had been successful in competing against Rome and had lasted for much, much longer? The choices you make in this game will help setup (or destroy) these potential alternate histories. This game explains how the petty or selfless actions of someone in a position of authority can, in a tenuous situation, help cause the vast potential of the future to be destroyed or created. \n\nThis game will also more obviously delve into how your decisions as a tutor to a royal heir may cause him to either become a great ruler or a vain despot or perhaps, something in between. Moreover, this game also attempts to answer the question as to exactly why providing people with a good education and access to knowledge is important to the longevity and survival of a civilization combined with the vital role that certain, sometimes seemingly minor technological inventions and scientific discoveries can play in the shaping of the unknown future. Seamlessly integrated into all this are important messages about the absolute necessity of maintaining balance and fairness among the people, even the very poor and those of another race, (messages which some of us, in our modern civilization seem to actively refuse to comprehend) if a civilization is to have a chance of thriving. \n\nUnfortunately, Choice of Alexandria suffers from the same basic failings as most other games of this type. Unlike in a real book, there is no Back button to go back to a previous page or to undue a previous decision so you can easily see an alternate plot. This is extremely frustrating if you want to easily or quickly see the full potential which this game has to offer and track multiple potential timelines simultaneously. In essence, the interface lacks flexibility. While the descriptions and writing is at least adequate for the most part it does tend to be a bit dry and tends to be lacking the visceral detail which many actual novels would possess. You get to read very little of your character's personal life nor do you get a clear idea of what it was like to actually live in the distant past. You almost never get to read about what your character's living arrangements are like for example. You don't get to hear how he/she bathes, how he/she eats how he/she sleeps etc. There's so little written on your character's quality of life that your character seems like a lifeless, 2-dimensional, cardboard mask for you to wear while you make occasional menu choices. He/She doesn't hardly seem to live, or breathe or sweat or ache.\n\nSo, In short:\n\n+Great choices, meaningful endings, philosophically deep, interesting alternate histories, good character motivations, reasonably logical results due to your choices. Important messages and themes. Socially and intellectual important content throughout. Thought provoking. Deals with issues relevant to the real world. Far more intellectually involved and deep than most high-graphics games which have ever existed.\n\n-Inflexible interface doesn't let you go back to a previous page or to a previous decision to easily see what else might have happened if you chose differently causing you to have to play the whole game over again if you want to see the differences caused by choosing any other choice. Somewhat dry writing style featuring little visceral or sensory detail and next to no information about what it might be like to live, from day to day as an Alexandrian royal tutor. Sometimes, seems like less of a true novel and more like pages and pages of interlocking introductions to various menu choices which makes main character seem like a mere interface through which you can make decisions rather than a living, breathing person. The first play through provides the most emotional involvement if you decide to try to seriously make the choices you think you would make in the same situation.

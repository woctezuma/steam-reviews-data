cute rpgmaker game for Halloween that I played this year and I really enjoyed it!\nStory\n8/10\nThe story wasn't anything extremely special, but it was very short and sweet. The characters were all very cute and the small story felt interesting and decently written.\nArt\n9/10\nAll the sprites and character portraits were very well designed and everything had a very cute Halloween feel\nSound\n7/10\nThe music and sounds were good but pretty average and nothing too special but still appealing.\nGameplay\n8/10\nThis is your typical rpgmaker puzzle game, with decently easy to solve puzzles, however one point I got stuck but I just looked up a walkthrough, however I probably got stuck due to my bad puzzle solving skills lol. But overall the puzzles were fun and not to challenging. \nOverall 8/10\nI recommend this game to play around Halloween since it's made for that time of year, but I feel you can play it anytime of the year. It was a very cute and enjoyable experience, and the jumpscares were not very scary and there were not very many so if you're worried about them don't be. This game was a great and it's FREE so give it a go.\n", "timestamp_created": 1509570789, "timestamp_updated": 1509570789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562997", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36189103": {"recommendationid": "36189103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201828097", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509538376}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Summary[/h1] \nNot recommended if you're looking for a creepy horror RPG with a disturbing story. The game is cute, but definitely not scary. Also not recommending the game due to issues with the Steam achievements.\n\nIf you don't care about either of those things and are looking for a free puzzle game, try it. [i]Trick & Treat[/i] isn\u2019t nearly as challenging as most horror RPGs, but it has a decent plot and some nice puzzles.\n\n[b]In the end, whether you decide to play it or not really depends on what you look for in a game like this. It\u2019s a free game, so you can always try if you\u2019re not sure. Since I\u2019ve played a lot of horror RPGs in the past, this game wasn\u2019t a challenge for me, but it might be if you\u2019re not familiar with similar games.[/b]\n\n[h1]Full review[/h1]\nI don\u2019t really get why this is tagged as \"horror\", because it isn\u2019t scary at all. There are maybe 1 or 2 malicious characters in the game, jumpscares that aren't jumpscares, and just a handful of bad endings. The summary on the store page mentions \"many deaths\", but that is an exaggeration. If you've played other horror RPGs like [i]Mad Father[/i], [i]The Witch's House[/i] or [i]Ib[/i], this game is a breeze.\n\nI'm not saying [i]Trick & Treat[/i] is a bad game. It's actually quite fun for a puzzle RPG, with some pretty diverse puzzles and should keep you busy for around 2-3 hours. For a horror RPG, however, it is disappointing. Just because the game is about halloween and has some bad endings doesn't make it a horror game.\n\nThere are some issues with the achievement system. It often occurs that achievements aren't unlocked even if you've done everything you're supposed to. Check the discussions in the community hub if you don\u2019t believe me.\n\nIf you're lucky, you can get all of the achievements in one run. I had to replay the game 4 times before I got the \"Candy\" achievement, because it just wouldn't unlock while I [b]did[/b] collect everything. Even clearing the game data and reinstalling the game after every run didn't seem to help. Then, at the end of the 4th replay, when I was about to give up on it, the achievement suddenly unlocked. Strange. All I can say is: the achievement system is unstable, and some players appear to have more luck than others. Not saying it's necessarily the developer's fault, but it [b]is[/b] frustrating.\n\nThere's an additional outfit that can be unlocked and equipped on the next playthrough, but honestly I don't see any reason to replay the game other than to get achievements you've missed- and even then, there's a chance you'll have to delete the game data, so you won't have the outfit anymore.

It's not the spooktacular game that most people would thing of when playing a halloween game, although some light horror elements are present (and I do mean light). \n\nYou play as Amelia, the maid of the young Charlotte, as the two of them attend a dinner party at a mansion deep in the woods. However Amelia and Charlotte quickly get separated from one another, with Amelia desperate to find her. Though it's ultimately story driven, much of the game is presented via logic puzzels. Each room is a riddle, and finding the answer allows you to progress. Some puzzles are even optional, but give more lore to the game if completed.\n\nThe main bulk of the game's story, sadly, is locked behind optional rooms -- with one even requiring you to beat the game before accessing -- but most of that is background information that isn't required to understand the game's story.\n\nFor a free to play RPG Maker game, I actually rather enjoyed it.

It's pretty short; I beat it in only two hours.\n\nThe game focuses on puzzles and they are actually pretty interesting and unique. I was stumped for a while on some of them. The game doesn't hold your hand and just tell you the answers either, but hints to you through enviromental clues. The fact that you have to explore and find things yourself, with no real hint to where some things are is refreshing too. YOU have to figure it out.\n\nAs for the genre, horror doesn't really nail it. There are horror elements in the game, sure, but I never really felt scared or have jumped at anything in this game. It's much more of a casual puzzle game where you can die in some cases. If you get scared by minor things like sudden pictures of not-so-scary things, then this game might scare you. It's a nice halloween game.\n\nThe music was fitting and gave the game an air of unease. The tracks fit where they were implemented, but I did go out and then back in to an area and the music dissapeared. Not sure if that was intended.\n\nThe plot was lacking; there was a story, but it didn't have much substance. If you are looking for something that has a lot of plot, this isn't the game for you to play, but this is a puzzle game, so it doesn't really need plot to be fun. As for the characters, they are kinda flat and baseless, but again, this game doesn't focus on that. There are a few unexpected plot twists at the end.\n\nAs for me, I enjoyed the game, as short as it was, and got the true ending on first play. It wasn't too hard, in the sense that dying is very easy to avoid if you pay attention to hints.\n\nPersonally I'd give this game a 6/10. It was short and sweet, fits the halloween vibe that it was going for, and has good puzzles. There are also extras you can unlock if you play again and get the true ending a second time, but that's for another time.

I loved the graphics and the story behind it. It was cute and I would recommend to others. However there were some mistakes I noticed.\n\nCons:\n1, For the True Ending: Achievement: Potion i The menu would not come up for me to use the Blue Potion to gather the achievement, I dont knoe if that was a glitch in the game or what, But it did not let me use it. So i did not get the achievement.\n2. I made sure i smashed all barrels and got all candies but still somehow ended up with 49/50 candy and 22/25 barrels, thus i could not open the chest in the extra room provided. I doubled checked my playthrough ( i record all games i play) and u did infact not miss any. So im not sure how this happened. \n3. Im not sure if this has a different outcome but for Achievment: Time - I clicked the clock it told me to click and take *a clock thats right twice a year* But it seemed to still be the wrong one, The other choice is the one we are supposed to use.

The aesthetic was a nice blend of spooky and cutely petite, and the art was very pleasing with different styles for different situations. The game itself was also very good, and I liked the idea of the rooms switching from clean and perfect to bloody messes depending on the situation. I also appreciated the attention to detail with all of the furniture and objects in the house, too; some of them do weird and cool things. The deaths are also spooky, and it's fun trying to figure out all the ways you can die in this game. Exploring the whole house is definitely worth it.\nThe plot is not too in-depth, but it's not meant to be. It's a nice game you can complete in an hour or two, and there are fun puzzles and things to figure out as you try to solve the mysteries of the house. I've actually replayed it a few times, and each runthrough is enjoyable.

(my youngest especially loved the fact that one of the main characters, Amelia, had the same name as her). I wouldn't classify this as a horror game per se, but more a mystery adventure game with spooky thematic elements. \n\nThe art is adorable in its clean simplicity, the characters are likable, the music helps set the mood and the writing is sure to make you giggle. There's plenty of candy to collect and rooms to explore. I found all the puzzles to be very original and have just the right amount of difficulty; not impossible but definitely will require some creative thinking.

Perfect for people who love these kinds of games but can't handle chases nor jumpscares (aka myself)!\n\nThis game also has a very endearing sense of humour! It mixes adorable pixel characters, a minorly spooky atmosphere and humour very well!\n\nI am incredibly excited for the release of The Witch's Tea Party, a prequel to this game featuring the childhood of the lovely Miss Charlotte!

The game had small elements of horror that worked very well, and I admit to being scared a few times while playing. The sprites of the characters and the characters themselves are absolutly adorable, and without spoiling anything, I just want to say I enjoyed the Extras after clearing the game. the small details (Again, I won't spoil) also made it better.

It's light-hearted but doesn't scare away from involving big \"taboo\" topics. I love the style of this game, the design and user-friendly layout and the story, don't get me started on the story! They left the story open, so here's hoping for a sequel because although I did get slightly confused with the storyline, I feel like that's due to the fact that they wanted to leave it open to interpretation. I feel that this game is strongly underrated and it's definately one of those games that one would play over and over again. I love the \"extra\" feature too, at the end of the game, I won't spoil it, but it definately adds to the charm.\n\nOverall Rating: 8/10 (PLEASE PLEASE PLAY THIS GAME, YOU WONT REGRET IT!! :))",

thought I'd try it. I actually just finished playing another game with a similar theme (cute/horror) and got curious with this one when I came across it. Plus, the reviews are really good. I'm glad I tried Trick & Treat because I really enjoyed it.\n\nWhat I liked about the game is the story, the mood of the game, and that the puzzles aren't too difficult to figure out. I can sometimes be lazy with puzzles and would resort to walkthroughs when I'm stuck but I didn't with this one. Just went with trial and error if I got stumped. The game is also quite short, making it a bit easy to do several playthroughs in order to see the different endings and get all the achievements. I was eager to complete the game that I slept late just to finish it.\n\nIn terms of cons, some players may not like that the game is short. Also, though the art is cute and nice, some bits could be a bit better. (However, if you've seen the extra [sketches], they're beautiful.)\n\nI'd say give this game a try.

Dance with the ghosts, play with the dolls, and hopefully, she can uncover the dark past of the house and see Miss Charlotte again.\nYou'll play as Amelia the Pumpkin Maid. It's about exploring and solving puzzles in a spooky atmosphere. There will be some horror elements, romance, many deaths (bad ends) and a happy ending of true love.\n\nWe play most of the story as Amelia as we go from room to room solving basic puzzles, item puzzles and possibly dying. I can't say that death comes harshly at any point because all the puzzles are relatively easy. What killed me most often was just checking objects which I knew better than to check (like standing on the gallows) but I'd just saved a moment prior and figured meh, why not. The only puzzle with any real difficulty (assigning the dolls) has no game over element. Not that death is a bad thing here. There are several Dead Ends to collect, featuring a short scene, a death title, and a basic CG.\n\nTrick and Treat also has a robust amount of replay value. With multiple endings, unlockables in the bonus room, a cute extra costume for Amelia, some additional dialogue and a slot machine-esque minigame you're not likely to stop after just one go. If I were to wish for anything it'd be a new room and puzzle or two when going for True End on a clear save (I saw a room that I could never get into so maybe I just missed it). I also wish you could see a textless version of the bonus art since it looked fantastic. Even better than what's in the rest of the game. Of course going through the game a second time you blast right through it with no hang-ups.\n", "timestamp_created": 1489352310, "timestamp_updated": 1489352310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30473558": {"recommendationid": "30473558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327091565", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487054135}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u79cdRPG\u6e38\u620f\u8fd8\u662f\u633a\u597d\u73a9\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5c31\u662f \u6ca1\u6709\u592a\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u53bb\u73a9~", "timestamp_created": 1489333469, "timestamp_updated": 1489333469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30455939": {"recommendationid": "30455939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198368365149", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487122824}, "language": "english", "review": "I very much enjoyed this cute little game.

La historia: es muy intrigante y te inspira a saber qu\u00e9 es lo que realmente est\u00e1 pasando a tu alrededor, al ser un misterio el \u201creplay value\u201d baja considerablemente, pero al parecer en el nuevo juego con el nuevo traje; los di\u00e1logos cambian as\u00ed que es un peque\u00f1o motivo para rejugarlo de nuevo. El arte del juego es muy decente y entendible no creo que haya problemas para nuevos jugadores, Al igual que el arte los personajes van de la mano; y puedo decir que las ilustraciones son muy adecuadas tambi\u00e9n los di\u00e1logos ayudan de manera obvia a ver el tipo de car\u00e1cter que tiene cada personaje sumando las expresiones ilustradas tenemos un elenco peque\u00f1o con personajes muy carism\u00e1ticos. El OST o Soundtrack:  estuvo muy bien, hay sonidos de ambientaci\u00f3n que me erizaron la piel; pero eso es otra historia.

But then I almost had to stop playing at one point entirely though ((there were ghosts that appeared on screen and triggered me)). A little word of advice to the creator...\nIf you're going to show such images of the deceased, have a little common decency to warn the audience. That's really all I ask for. When you see something like on screen, it really can put you in the greatest of fits.

It's not your typical trick or treat night however. Filled with cute horror scenarios, funny ghosts and nice puzzling, this RPG Maker game is actually quite clever, giving the players a mix of feelings throughout the game.\n\nControlling a cute girl with a pumpkin in her head can lead to many things, but although some scenarios in this game are funny, others are actually intense and even worthy of any major horror game out there! But if none of this appeals to you, then you can certainly rely on extremely well design puzzles. Very interesting, random, and keep you wondering about the different book shelves, rooms and items around the curious and cursed Castle.\n\nAlthough being surprisingly good, it's short. The end is fantastic, and leaves the player with a terrific feeling over Halloween, which is an absolutely perfect time to play this game.\nWith multiple endings, only curiosity and a good heart can lead you to the final and true ending, where friends rejoice and together with the player, unlocking artwork, outfits, curiosities and more extras gives a great meaning to a second playthrough.\n\nA game developed by a great team dedicated to give meaning to all small things.\nI wouldn't trade my 3 hours in [b]Trick & Treat[/b] for anything else.

I recommend it, if you have about an hour of free time and feel in a Halloween festive mood.\n\nPros: [list]\n[*]Free-to-Play\n[*]Prequel in Development\n[*]Short length for those who want an easy playthrough. Not difficult compared to Witch's House.\n[*]Subtle to not-so-subtle scares\n[*]Respectable art and sprite animation\n[*]If you've played things like Witch's House, then you'll get a lot of the jokes and meta humour.\n[*]Really liked the True ending.\n[*]Extras post-game. Also an optional art book.\n[/list]\nCons (or Meh Points):[list]\n[*]Short length for those who want more content.\n[*]True ending is a nice respectable end. However, the normal ending doesn't feel unique on it's own.\n[/list]\nSummary: Worth playing as a first step towards masterpieces like \"Witch's House\". Looking forward to future projects from Rabbiton studio.\n\nSimilar Game Recommendations (On Steam): [list]\n[*]Freebirds Games- To the Moon (Sequels being produced)\n[*]Rabbiton Studio- The Witch's Tea Party (forthcoming)\n[*]Mad Father- If you want something dark.

It wasn't scary at all for me (honestly), but maybe that's just me. I can't say much without spoiling the story so this will be a short sort of a \"thank you\" review. Your goal is to collect candy and solve puzzles. You can try solving them on your own. If don't want to do that or simply get stuck you can check out the walkthrough and achievement guide that helped me complete the game. I don't think \"Trick & Treat\" should be free as it was interesting and I didn't find any glitches or cons at all. Perfect for achievement hunters (no pun intended xD) or just anyone who likes free and/or RPG games. Overall I can easily give it a 10/10 especially because it is free.", "timestamp_created": 1475682918, "timestamp_updated": 1475683054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

I always appreciate good sprite work and it's certainly present here, not to mention there's plenty of original item sprites and backgrounds from what I can tell.\nI'm not super familar with all the DLC packs for every version of RPG maker, but I know for a fact there's plenty of original work here.\nThere were a few choices I felt were a tad odd, such as the icon for the dirty table cloth being a worn out cloak, but it wasn't enough to make me neglect all the GOOD choices that were made.\n\nSound: \nThe music was fitting throughout and I enjoyed the switch between silence and sound. The music that went along with the more lighthearted moments such as the ending was pleasing to hear as well. Also, I always enjoy when RPG maker games have sound effects for foot steps, and there was a nice variety here too. \n\nStory:\nObviously, do not expect 20, 10 or even 5 hour's worth of game play from this. This is a short, sweet little game to take about an hour or so of your time.\nNow, of course that isn't a bad thing. Some things are better being short and simple. I just think it's worth mentioning so you don't have heighted expectations for a lenghty game.\nThe story as I put it, was short and sweet. I won't go into great detail since I want this to be spoiler-free, but I really enjoyed the ending the most out of it. Which to be honest, is where most of the story takes place. You find some clues here and there, but all the real interactions take place at the end.\n\nBiggest Complaint:\nI didn't really understand the point of typing in the answers for getting into the dining room and a couple other spots? I was really confused, and then eventually realized it had no meaning. At least... I think. \nI know in the bonus room you can say PUMPKIN at one of the spots to get a Dead End ending, but other than that, I don't get it. I felt like I should have needed to find a hint somewhere and actually give an answer, or this should have just been removed altogether.\nI feel like this is more of a personal complaint, rather than a real flaw.

isn't distracting or obnoxious and matches scenes well\n- more than one possible ending\n- strikes the perfect balance between being spooky and light-hearted\n- likable characters with charming personalities/interactions, including npcs\n- multi-dimensional: solve puzzles, play a mini-game, explore the mansion and unravel a mystery, rescue mission to save your friend, etc\n- possibility to earn achievements\n- halloween and fairytale themes throughout\n\ncons:\n- short gameplay\n- small map. the game pretty much takes place entirely inside the mansion, which is large (5F if you include the dungeon) but is still just one place. the story still feels complete, but it would be cool if we could explore different areas more, even if it were just the house we live in at the very beginning\n- puzzles are interesting but not particularly challenging\n\n\nYou can tell that the developer put a lot of care and effort into this game and it is very enjoyable to play- to the point that I immediately tried getting a different ending after finishing my first one. In my opinion, the fact that this game is free is reason enough to overlook and even justify the cons I listed.

It\u2019s an RPGmaker puzzle game. Regardless, I enjoyed my time spent with it.\n\nIn Trick & Treat, you play as Amelia. She and her (girl)friend Charlotte leave the house to go trick or treating for Halloween. But the town is decorated too scary\u2026 so they decide to hit up the spooky house in the woods instead! Inside, Charlotte and Amelia get separated, and Amelia has to explore the house to track her down.\n\nThe game walks the line between scary and cutesy very well, with little touches that are very nice. For example, every carpet in the game is soaked with blood, so when Amelia walks on them they squish. The puzzles can get a little weird and esoteric, but not any outrageous moon logic is in play. And, best of all, the game has a happy, adorable true ending.\n\nIt\u2019s short, it\u2019s cute, it\u2019s free. RPGmaker games can alternatively repulse or endear me, and this game definitely endeared me.

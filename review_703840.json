By playing through the campaign, you can unlock various characters, such as a sloth and a puffer fish, to play as, as well as hats for them to wear and vehicles for them to drive.\n\nOne of the game's stronger points is its vehicles and their impact on the way you approach levels. Similar to the different characters in Happy Wheels, there are a bunch of different vehicles in this game that each have a different 'special' ability. All (that I've seen so far at 1.6 hours) are drivable with WASD but each one has a different propulsion system that affects the physics in a different way. You start out with a bath tub with a temporary boost attached. You can unlock a car with helicopter rotors and one with a propellor on the back. These different vehicles then change the way you approach levels, as some require more precision, while others give you more freedom as to how you use the verticality of the levels.\n\nTaking other cues from Happy Wheels, this game also has a rather diverse level editor that allows you to place pretty much anything the developer could, from platforms to spike traps to giant, spinning towers of face-whacking. And while this game doesn't have any gore in it, there is a nice feeling of impact when you hit the ground after you are invariably hit by something, and your vehicle can get increasingly beat up over time, losing its bumpers, its wheels, and even its pilot. At any time, you can eject from your vehicle to try to roll to the finish line, and should your vehicle be utterly obliterated, you can try to find a pair of wheels  and ride them. \n\nTo go along with the level editor there is a browse level feature that allows you to play other peoples's levels, which can range from the downright absurd to 'just like Dark Souls' impossibly difficult. Provided you have the skill and time, you can actually make a level that wouldn't look out of place in the game's developer-made campaign. The campaign, meanwhile, doesn't have an actual story- more, it's a way for the developer to put their own stamp on the game in more than just its coding, and for you to unlock all the vehicles and pilots in a structured manner. \n\nAs it's in early access, it doesn't yet have the full extent of the content it will, one day, have, but what's already here is good. Levels have a range of appearances and structures, and can be designed any way. There's loads of stuff to unlock, and each vehicle feels properly unique. And, to put the icing on the cake, you can put your own stamp on it.

But for what I've played so far, it's a fun platformer with different characters to use. What I can say for sure, is the game has a challenging curve already on it's early access, and I hope it stays that way. Since different rides have different effects makes it more puzzle like as well, having to learn or figure out how to go about progressing on certain areas. \n\nFor the graphics within the game, the style is very cartoon like, and that's a plus for a game being about animals going fast as hell. The transformations from interacting with the enviroment also add a lot of charm to the game itself. Haven't tested all that's available, but I can say it's a fun ride indeed from that. \n\nControllers feel responsive enough , with a standard keyboard, haven't tried a controller. But you do have to have some precision when moving if you wanna be getting those fast clear times. The control itself is not super complicated so it's simple to start from any level.  \n\nThere's not much of a story, the game just throws you in, but it has what you would call and action/arcade feel to it, so for being early access, not much of a story is expected.  If they were to add a story that be nice, maybe something fun and simple. Since the game is about having fun in a fast paced kind of way.\n\n Overall I'd give it a 7/10,  might change over the time playing it.

I mean I really wasn't expecting that much going into it considering I found the game Goat Simulator to be a bit gimmicky. But I was pleasantly surprised at how this game actually is! Now granted its in Early Access so there are some issues like the game being about 2 hours long right now (or so I'd guess, The first area took me about 40 minutes to complete), but not that that matters right now because the level editor is really in depth.\n\nThe game is batshit crazy, let's get that out there quickly. The characters are goofy, the vehicles range from plant pots to flamethrowers and the child like soundtrack with spontanous plucks and beeps really add to the personality this game is trying to build up, I mean, the game abbreviates to ASS for christs sake. \n\nI played about 2 online levels (which by the way people are already going crazy in the level making aspect), and I also played around with the level editor and it's exactly what you'd expect, the whole game gives me a sort of Little Big Planet vibe mixed in with Happy Wheels, its really fun.\n\nYou got your money's worth if you end up buying it. You could definitely get up to 4 hours playtime on this game for definite and I don't feel like i've wasted my money.\n\nIf there are some complaints I have, the physics can be a tiny bit jerky at some times and it doesn't feel as smooth as it probably would want to. I also would advice adding some boss fights in there, I don't know if there is in area 2 but area 1 just finished with a longer level and I was hoping to fight some big epic boss or something.\n\nGo in expecting good, platforming fun and that is exactly what you're going to get.

(Video Review with gameplay) https://youtu.be/GaETY0A1zIc The game has a graphical and musical style that will please both the eyes and ears. Gameplay is highlighted by excellent controls that are responsive and sharp with a difficulty curve that eases you in and then really ramps up. I rarely feel like a death or a missed jump is due to balancing issues but rather poor timing or execution on my end. There is a level editor included with the game for creating your own content, and as it's rather extensive it is only limited by the users imagination. There are multiple vehicles, characters, and customization options available for unlock, and at the time of writing this I have a sloth, puffer fish and the starting chicken. The game really is a joy to play and I found myself with a permanent grin plastered across my face during my gaming sessions. The game also boosts quite a few graphical options to tweak allowing for play on most machines. I look forward to jumping right back into playing, and can't wait to see what amazing levels my fellow steamers dream up.

It contains an incredible amount of levels, and even (if I'm not mistaken) all classic levels from N, as well as 'Ultimate' levels. All in all we're talking thousands of levels. Tens of thousands if you include community levels.\n\nN++ is a good game, but can be frustrating at times. Balance is a bit weird, in that some levels that are very easy to beat will be very difficult when it comes to getting all the gold in said level. However this is not unusual for gaming. \n\nSome levels you will have to play hundreds of times to not only beat it but get all the gold, if that is your thing.

It has no fat on it. There are no flaws. The only flaw in this game is the flaw you have as a player, that prevents you from beating the next level. It is all based on whether or not you can perform. Every win is proof that you can win next time. Every failure is just the first step to winning. It has style, the level names are clever and punny, manipulating enemies is gratifying. There's too much packed into this game to summarize, and nothing that shouldn't be there is present. 10/10.\n\nLEVEL EDITOR:\nEasy and simple as making pumpkin pie during the holidays. Follow the instructions, and then if you want to, get creative. The recipies for your levels are waiting for you to discover them.\n\nIRRELEVANT PERSONAL OPINION:\nThis game taught me a very important lesson about life, believe it or not. I was playing through the E-row on the N++ levels page, trying to beat them all to get to the secret levels. Every time I would start a new E-row episode, I would play through it and get to the final level absolutely furious. I could not beat the final level to these episodes. It was very frustrating at first. Many times I literally pulled my hair out. But, what I learned was this, since this game does not save your progress in episode, if you give up on the final level, you cannot continue where you left off. You have to play through the entire episode again. This taught me to finish strong, to see things through. If you give up at the end, your progress means nothing and it was all in vain. It's helping me complete my work and studies on time, to be honest.\n\nAlso, this game has a ton of nostalgia for me too, because I've been playing this game for about 8 years now, since the first flash version showed up on flash game websites. So that aspect of it is enjoyable too.\n\nTL;DR:\nThis game is the best platformer you will ever play, it tops Super Meat Boy and the original Mario and Sonic games as well.

Now for my review -\n\nI think this game, in its entirety, is MUCH better in every aspect compared to the previous versions.  \n\nFrom character customization to level design, everything has been perfected.  Everything looks amazing, and the music choice fits the game as well.  The color schemes add much more to the game than the dull face of the original.  The colors change with the themes, so your character looks very different based on the mood (and also I gotta put in that the headband looks sick lol).\n\nThe levels, at first seem easier, but get a bit harder over time.  I would say that the previous version focused more on pure skill and techinicality/precision of jumping, but this has more puzzle elements to it.  Co-op is much better as well, and now you are capable of adding 4 players instead of just 2.  \n\nI've never played with the level design, but I've heard it is very good.\n\nThe biggest reason why I like this game is because it is so relaxing and fun and a great de-stresser.

Now over twelve years old, N boiled down the platformer genre to its barest essentials and then cranked up the difficulty that could be offered through those mechanics. We\u2019re two generations removed from the original Flash release, and N++ contains all the content, concepts, and challenge you would expect from an evolution of the series. Assuming you can hang with the precipitous difficulty curve, there\u2019s an absurd amount to discover about the game even for fans of N and N+.\n\nYou\u2019re a ninja, which is a pretty good plot hook in and of itself. There\u2019s no story offered aside from you loving gold and you needing to escape\u2026 wherever the hell you are. This translates into single-screen levels with an exit door and a switch that opens said door. All you have to do is hit the switch and get out before time runs out, and collecting gold helps bump your timer back up. Complicating matters are a vast array of explosives, lasers, drones, clones, zappers, and other traps between you, the gold, and the exit. The further you get into the game the more you\u2019ll need to cheat death as you sprint and wall-jump your way from one level to the next.\n\nIt\u2019s a challenge platformer, one that prides itself on giving you simple, solid mechanics and pressing you to master them completely. You have no attacks or special moves, just a brisk run, a floaty jump, and the ability to cling to and leap from walls. Everything in your way kills you instantly with just a touch, even walls and ceilings if you get your momentum up high enough. The controls are impossibly tight so you have full command of your ninja in weaving through minefields and springing from narrow ledges, and they even hide a few clever mechanics like being able to reach high ascent speeds through quick wall jumps or getting extra air from leaping perpendicularly from inclines.\n\nThere\u2019s always going to be a frustration factor with instant death platformers but N++ handles this aspect with an expert level of wisdom. Respawns are near-instant, and with levels being only one screen large there\u2019s a general limit on how long they can be. However, levels are grouped together in sets of five that must be beaten in a single sitting. You can always quit a level if it\u2019s too hard and come back to it later but sets must be started from the beginning, so if you\u2019re stuck on the last of the five there\u2019s a very real pressure on you to power through it. Late in the game this subtle goading is used to great effect in sets that have multiple problem levels, keeping you chipping away at the latter ones just because the former ones were such a pain.\n\nThe levels themselves are exquisite works of minimalist art, living squarely in that space of clean lines and smooth animations that REZ, Lumines, and EDGE occupy. Most have some resemblance or pattern or meaning in their structure, supported by clever titles always shown in the lower right corner. You\u2019ll also unlock color schemes as you play, allowing you to change the simple grays to vibrant mixes of every hue imaginable. Some even introduce their own challenges by making certain traps blend together, but can certainly be avoided in favor of more practical, high-contrast palettes.\n\nWith such a simple gameplay concept it\u2019s the traps that give this one life, and it\u2019s also the traps that fans of N and N+ will be most concerned with. Most of the design is based around mines, explodey things that will kill you instantly. Levels often have these dotted along walls, laid in patches on floors, protruding from corners, and assembled into aesthetically-pleasing clusters all to threaten you with death if you flub a wall jump. N++ introduces a major new mechanic here with inactive mines that arm after touching them once. This allows for entirely new styles of levels where you have to choose your paths carefully lest you render them impossibly lethal for the return trip.\n\nWhile mines will be your primary nemesis, there are plenty more ways to end your very swift and mobile life. Electrified drones and seekers will trace walls or home in on you to kill you with a touch. Turrets of all types, machine gun, laser, and the dreaded homing missile, will track you if you dare poke your head out of cover. Moving platforms, one-way floors, trap doors, and powerful springs can all help or hinder your progress depending on how they\u2019re used. A few notable additions here include accelerators that boost your momentum when you pass them, used to launch you over gaps or crush you against walls. Then there are the clones, ominous swirls that form into copies of you that follow your moves exactly and kill you if they catch up to you. The new additions for this version in particular are used to set up some very clever and unique challenges, keeping the game fresh even for long-time veterans of the series.\n\nRounding out this solid offering is the fact that it is absurdly huge in scope. There are, and I\u2019m not making this up, over 1500 single-player levels to complete. Sets of levels are arranged in a huge grid with the top row unlocked, and beating one of those sets unlocks the set below it which gives some much-needed flexibility in level selection. Then if you beat a set of five sets it becomes unlocked in Hardcore mode, where your retries are limited and tied to your timer. You\u2019ve also got hundreds of Co-op and Race levels for local multiplayer, and then the vast oceans of user-created levels to choose from. All this makes N++ not just the definitive entry in the N series but one of the definitive challenge platformers in the genre. Near-flawless mechanics, clever level design, and massive amounts of content make it a must-have for any fan of platformers.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

You run, keep the momentum, jump, fall, slide-ish so you dont go splat on the floor, dodge missiles, dog like beeping electrical robots, gauss riffles, jump over mines, collect gold, and finish levels.\n\nThe game also has ++ \"skins\" and songs.

Very tight simple controls, huge amounts of interesting levels, different approaches to each level, high skill cap, minimalist but effective graphics, and a great soundtrack.\n\nHowever I'm already running into a couple very frustrating issues. The hitboxes on the mines are pretty annoying, there are tons of times I'll graze on with my head and phase through but then my legs will somehow clip them from many pixels away, even though visually they look perfectly clear of the mine. Also some of the shocking obstacles feel inconsistent with how far they'll shock you from and it seems to depend on the direction they're moving. \n\nI really liked the gentle progression of difficulty in levels until I got to last level of A17 on the N++ set. I completed all the levels before it without ever needing more than 10 lives on any particular level, but now I'm stuck on this anomoly. What a horrible idea for a level... there are shock balls that follow you through tunnels and rooms, but you are unable to tell which way they'll move as they come out of the tunnel. They are released as you run too so the timing changes each time if you don't run it exactly the same.... you're stuck with waiting around for the orbs to line up just right so you can sneak through them. Or even waiting to release them so they're all grouped together to make your dodges just a little easier.... you get no cue whatsoever of which direction they'll go or the track each individual orb will follow. Sometimes they run along the walls, sometimes they stick out into space for a tile or two, and they're all mixed up.\n\nI really hope this is just a one off. I was having a good time with the challenge until this specific level... I'll admit platforming is my achilles heel in gaming, yet the type of challenge this one level provides isn't compelling or intuitive in any way, it's just an annoyingly long waiting game, plain horrible in comparison to every single flawless level before it.

On the perspective by just looking at it, it's fun to play and the simple controls works great with keyboards. Your primary objective is to reach for the key card and find your way to the exit. If you want to, you may challenge yourself to collect all gold blocks in the level without dying. Its almost no different than any other platformers, but what makes it special is that it has very unique UI color schemes and awesome techno musics. The music helps you to concentrate while playing and you never feel bored. You kept dying again and again but in result you won't want to give up on playing anymore because you are so into the game by just listening the musics. The game also rewards you new color schemes after completing a certain number of stages and each of them is very pleasant looking. Clearly this game has a distinctive way to express its beauty.\n\nThe game is predicated on tough jumps and controls, and its very own physics system that's built on momentum. All you can really do with your ninja avatar is run and jump, but you must be able to use acceleration and precise leaps to land on your desired place. By trying to complete the level you will be experienceing countless deaths and resulting successes eventually makes you feel that you have really achieved a lot of things. The game tells you to complete each level within 90 seconds and picking up gold along the way to increase your timer. If you are to become a hardcore player (like me), you will likely want to collect all the gold up.\n\nN++ has a huge number of campaign levels (2000+) and even more levels uploaded by the players all around the world. While I am still struggling on completing first part of Solo levels I still can't believe that my total play time has reached 5 hours(believe me, its not short compared to other games). The Co-op levels requires 2-4 players to play, and there will be parts where you have to kill yourself into hazards to make a way for your friend to reach to the exit. But usually it's pretty much the same with solo levels (sometimes you can complete a Co-op level all by yourself). You can also play the uploaded levels as well, or you can make levels of your own and upload them like others. Unfortunately it's a huge dissapointment that there is no online play for the Co-op levels.\n\nN++ might lack online play and feel like more of the same, but it's pretty much everything a platformer fan could want out of a sequel.

It offers a huge variety of levels on very different skill levels, varying from a casual experience to hardcore grinds to finish one.\n\nFirst thing I've noticed after launching the game were modes, you have a standard singleplayer platformer experience, but that's not it. There's also a CO-OP mode and race mode. The co-op mode is self explanatory, you plug another controller in, and play along a friend, the level design in those is pretty good, you often need both players to survive, and even if not they're really helpful to have around. The race mode is a bit weird, and I didn't have the chance to get into it fully at least yet, so there's not much I can say about it, but there's plenty of levels in it too.\n\nThe main part though, is definitely the singleplayer experience, where you have 3 tabs full of levels as of now (Ultimate Edition) and also intro levels tab. There are a lot of levels starting At A and ending on E all having 20 episodes consisting of 5 stages each. Then after you finish all those you get to move along to X row which is basically an expert challenge. I personally dislike the idea behind the episodes, as you have to beat all 5 during one playthrough to get the progress done, because when you beat one the level progress doesn't save, and you have to start an episode over, but that's a minor flaw.\n\nThe game is also movement based. It takes a while to get used to the \"slide-y\" movement, but it's actually very tight, and feels good, not being floppy whatsoever. There are coins scattered throughout all the levels, and the ninja collects them to get some more time for finishing the episode, but those can often be skipped without paying much attention to, because there's usually plenty of time. You can also try to collect them all, as it's often fun to go through an alternate route to gather some, and they provide a pretty tough additional challenge, though I suggest going for them after beating an episode, as you can only access a particular level after beating said episode.\n\nThe graphics and music fit together very well. The minimalistic artstyle goes along greatly with this soundtrack. The electronic beats make a great \"background noise\". There are also plenty of themes to play around with, as you unlock them by beating episodes. Only thing I wish was added would be a theme editor, as I don't think it'd be hard to implement and some of the themes are just straight up bad(For example light blue menu with lighter blue text).\n\nTo sum it up, there are some things I have issues with, such as boring waiting game levels with tough parts near the end that basically test the limits of your patience, and the episodic nature of the world hub which doesn't allow for easy quitting, but overall, the game is very good, the movement feels amazing, the physics feel very good once you get used to them and the soundtrack is great.", "timestamp_created": 1495210858, "timestamp_updated": 1495211334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500010", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31836505": {"recommendationid": "31836505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101498252", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495182226}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e00\u5768s\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u722c\u5899", "timestamp_created": 1495182275, "timestamp_updated": 1495182275, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.221148", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31835307": {"recommendationid": "31835307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198290470039", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 240, "last_played": 1516072779}, "language": "english", "review": "I RAGED SO HARD THAT I BROKE MY KEYBOARD\n\n\nNOW I CAN'T RAGE ANYMORE\n\n\n10/10 IGN", "timestamp_created": 1495175562, "timestamp_updated": 1495175562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31816184": {"recommendationid": "31816184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139180514", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489638793}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended", "timestamp_created": 1495082583, "timestamp_updated": 1495082583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482320", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31812468": {"recommendationid": "31812468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082693441", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495062421}, "language": "english", "review": "Best platformer of all time, and so many levels, I probably won't ever beat it...", "timestamp_created": 1495058733, "timestamp_updated": 1495058733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545683", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31794866": {"recommendationid": "31794866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067012399", "num_games_owned": 1185, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512328399}, "language": "english", "review": "Pure skill based platformer, with no story to hold it back.

However, I do believe it is worth the price in spite of only having played the solo gamemode in my nine hours so far.\n\nThis game is nothing graphically, but the level design and music are where it shines. The level design is perfect at inducing a sense of flow along with the music. Without having to collect the gold pieces or to beat levels quickly or to beat levels in a gauntlet without dying, it's an easy game for people who want to play it casually. Collecting the gold often forces a player to carefully balance their movement with two or more mechanics at once, and it's implemented brilliantly. For example, many levels require you to carefully balance on blocks that move with your weight as a laser homes in on you. Each level has a sense of motif, and challenge feels well-rewarded. Plenty of times a challenge ahead of me seemed tough, but not impossible, and the game has lulled me into spending 30+ minutes on specific levels to prove myself.\n\nPros:\n-Great accessibility for challenge-seekers and people who want to instantly delve into gameplay\n-Also a great game for casuals\n-Music\n-Designed with flow in mind\n-Level names are funny\n-Instantly launches the player back into the action after he dies\n\nCons:\n-Few types of obstacles exist in the game, and though all of them are used amazingly and in different ways throughout the game, there could be some more.\n-LET ME GET THAT LAST GOLD PIECE.

You may think the style is extremy simple and you know what, you're right! Its simple yet its so charming, you get tons of different palletes to choose from, different colors for your ninja and some accessories, the customization here for the levels alone is pretty damn solid that there's bound to be one that interests pretty much everyone, in general they have rather contrasting colors to have the level stand out. I think if it wasn't for such a simple artstyle, the developers not have as much content in the game, its a good compromise in my opinion. \n\nControls are solid, I mean SOLID. It has a floaty feeling yet has finesse and precision. You feel like you have complete control over when your character starts and stops both up and down and left and right, I have yet to find a game that manages to balance it out as well as this one does. The momentum mechanic works really well, your character feels like it has force applied to it when you run and jump, jumping off of walls and gaining speed. Its so satisfiying!\n\nThe amount of content you get for this game is absurd, I've already put 5 hours into it and I haven't even scratched the surface of what this game has to offer. It does not descriminate, whatever way you choose to play is here. Want to speedrun? Got it, collect them all for that completionist side of you? Right here! Want to take it nice and steady, go at at reasonable pace and not care about speedrunning or collecting? The game has you covered, in fact the time it gives to complete a level is generous, I have not once found myself even when I was taking my sweet sweet time to fail a level because the timer ran out. The developers promise 100+ hours and so far I believe them on that, even just completing the solo mode itself will take you I'd say a solid 20-30 hours if you don't touch the rest of the content or collect anything and just rush through it, you've already got more than what you paid for. Heck I remember when we paid 60 dollars for triple A games for 8 hours. 8 HOURS!\n\nBesides the solo mode as I mentioned it also has hardcore which is basically your time attack mode in which you try to complete a level as fat as possible, you're given a reasonable starting time and from there it stacks if you collect the orange squares. Feeling brave? Do hardcore without going for the orange squares and that right there will be an extra challenge.\n\nTHEN, you also have the level creator, yes I am not done yet. You've got thousands upon thousands of user made levels, granted some of them aren't up to snuff with the content the devs provided, it further expands the playability of this game beyond what you'd imagine for a 15 dollar game.\n\nHave I mentioned the soundtrack yet? No? Well I must!!! The soundtrack is absolutly superb, its a combination of electronic with slow relaxed drum and base tones with some occasional chillstep, it is incredible, it really goes hand in hand with the gameplay.\n\nDon't miss this game! I nearly gave it a pass because I thought it was going to be a rather bland experience yet everytime I jump in, I feel so compelled to sink hours of my life into it. Like a tube of pringles, once you start you won't stop. ;)\n\nScore: 10/10.

The bad news here being they are laid out as episodes, a set of 5 levels meshed into 1 falling into a category; A, B, C, D, E and X (A considered easiest, X for Expert) and while an episode starts out easy you are required to complete it in order to revisit or select any level at will, this can be frustrating for end levels as they are commonly the most challenging.\n\nSince Ultimate Edition just got released earlier today I have to say the level set has expanded exponentially, the hardcore episodes are under their ultimate category and should be undertaken with more caution, as I imagine they're more fiendish than anything seen prior. Hardcore stories also came with this edition and now you're on a timer which will not reset upon death, with an endless ticking clock and gold only counted when you reach the exit this new mode is for the side of players who enjoy greater challenge. I am not be recommending this for casual gamers because this is essentially a huge chunk of time per each column with no guarantee you'll make it in time or beat the column at all, with that said I also ask potential buyers to consider this.\n\nAs for obstacles the game really does a decent job of being fair the vast majority of the time, I can't rate them as best or worst because the way they are laid out per level ranges depending on the level in question. A few things worth noting is that obstacles do combine for greater challenge (pro?) however they are very limited in scope, as other reviewers mention when you go so far in you've seen most of what's in store (con, enemy/obstacle limited variety).\n\nMetanet overall does a really good job especially considering certain gold requires momentum to obtain, they also make an all gold level challenging however I fear the design choice to have an all gold achievement be for every level in solo to be a tease, so achievement hunters I would not recommend this product to you as you may never get them all.\n\nGame does inclue legacy, which is a 'best of' previous titles levels, this means anybody who has played or does play the previous titles will remember these levels fondly or grimace at seeing them again, I myself enjoyed a good throwback to the flash games levels and am pleased to regard them as good as the plusplus, I skipped N+ so can't speak for that. \n\nI am inclined to mention the user levels are present and are admittedly the most challenging found in game for me personally, they can range from fair to downright BS unfair and the main pro here is that any steam level can be played if you can find and they're not laid out in episode format so for a quick blast on the game or a pick me up every now and again they are the best addtion provided you keep within your skill range and know when to give up.\n\nAll of this is based on my personal experiences and I am inclined to admit some may view my opinion as biased as I am a fan of the game and hold it in high regard, I don't think it would be an understatement to say it has the best platformer experience if you're not put off by its appearance and if you can appreciate the little things then this game is a little gem that will certainly go a long way, if the idea of running faster to jump higher and do things quicker isn't for you skip this.", "timestamp_created": 1492807359, "timestamp_updated": 1492812560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537661", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31282531": {"recommendationid": "31282531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053363049", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508422464}, "language": "english", "review": "Possibly the saltiest platformer that has ever existed", "timestamp_created": 1492805575, "timestamp_updated": 1492805575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474453", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31282492": {"recommendationid": "31282492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070672491", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3001, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491230917}, "language": "english", "review": "DOES THE WORLD NEED ANOTHER PLATFORMER?\n\n\nNOT AFTER THIS.", "timestamp_created": 1492805378, "timestamp_updated": 1492805378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492424", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31281158": {"recommendationid": "31281158", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975305392", "num_games_owned": 536, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503348183}, "language": "english", "review": "It's the best platformer.

Controlling  a nondescript ninja, you try to reach the goal on bit-sized minimalistic levels with scarce art, electronic music and gameplay mechanics focused on gaining momentum and precision jumps around various deathtraps. This is as simple as you can get... and unfortunately it's not enough for me.\n\nWhile seeing the spreadsheet-sized level selection, I cannot really find any reason to continue finishing it. This is mostly because after 4-5 hours you basically saw all interesting content in the game or at least you feel it that way. All enemies, all blocks, all basic mechanics are learned. From that point only thing that change is the ramping up difficulty and unlockable color pallets, some of which by the way, are absolutely confusing. N++ is just an endless conveyor belt of levels, each less interesting and exciting than the previous one which in the end makes completion very unsatisfing. Thanks to limited size of them and low amount of different enemies and objects, game gets stale extremely fast. You simply cannot magically conjure mass of interesting levels with so many limiting factors. Because of this N++ seems to be stuck mentally in its flash-game roots where you played it only because there wasn't any particular alternative and you just had 5 minutes of spare time.\n\nIn short, N++'s minimalist approach is more of a curse than a blessing. I believe that only people who are genuinely into extremely challenging, simple platformers that don't mind the barren presentation and lack of variety, will be satisfied. I'm not in the mood of proving my platforming skill to anybody and if you also don't feel grabbed by looking at the gameplay and screenshots...

I have also played this for about 20 hours on the PS4.\n\nIf you play this game, you will die. You think you died in Bloodborne? You think the bosses in Dark Souls 3 can kill you in a couple of hits? Lol. Just lol. People complaining that other games kill them too easily have never played N++. This is a game so nightmarishly difficult that, according to websites which track Steam achievements, no-one has obtained some of the achievements in N++. No-one. Worldwide. And it's the same on the PS4. \n\nThis does not mean the achievements are \"exclusive\", it means the game has been designed in such a way that people simply cannot get them, which is poor design - what's the point in having achievements nobody can actually achieve? If you try some of the later levels you may well find some of them impossible, or simply too annoying. The maps with lots of \"evil clones\" of your character in particular are very frustrating. Some maps are so overloaded with moving things that I start feeling migrainey and struggle to \"understand\" the map. Missiles are no longer the only things that will kill a skilled player.\n\nIf you liked N+ and have waited impatiently for a sequel, this is its bigger, badder brother. The way each element is employed in N++ results in a tougher and longer experience (although including N+'s maps seems like a cheap way to claim \"we have over a thousand levels\"). \n\nThe physics seem a bit improved, but realistically, I find they don't make too much sense, and you can die in unexpected ways, such as hitting a ramp at speed (which will either kill you or save your life). The annoying bouncing boxes with their weird effect on your jumping are still present. I'm quite good at the game (although far from a world-beater) and have got pretty far, and I reckon at least half of all my deaths have been due to the weird, annoying physics, which can cause the controls to be unresponsive for a split second and your ninja to move in unexpected ways. Clipping a wall with your feet does this a lot. Your ninja is not particularly nimble. However, if you thought the way momentum works in the original Super Mario Brothers was superlative, you will love the physics of N++. (Cue someone pretending to be a physics professor who will elaborate on how \"accurate\" and \"convincing\" the game is.)\n\nNote that nothing else in the game is affected by the physics, so you still see rockets performing super-tight turns which you will never match, and the reload time for a new missile is still less than a second.\n\nThere are a ton of secrets in the game but I think most people will miss nearly all of them. You can unlock a super-hard swathe of maps if you complete every single level in the game, although again, most people will have given up far before this point. Not every map or episode has walkthroughs on Youtube if that's your bag, so again, you lose out. I am led to believe that some of the \"secrets\" are simply harder versions of existing maps, and if that's correct, is it really worth bothering with?\n\nThe map editor is a bit overwhelming, I didn't find it nearly as simple or intuitive as N+'s, but if you can harness it, you will be able to make some truly stunning efforts. A pity there appears to be no real management of user content online as most of the maps are simply impossible for the average (or even the good) player. It would be brilliant if there was an option to play or download easier episodes, so you can just kick back and have fun. Still, you can make some genuinely fun stuff for your friends. I haven't uploaded anything yet so don't know if you can do an episode, as you could in N+.\n\nSo why am I giving this the thumbs up? Well, I'll go on record as saying at least 75% of the maps range from being quite enjoyable to downright amazing to play. The sheer scale of imagination, when the game is actually built from very few components, is stunning. Even the moronically difficult maps, the ones which bring your enjoyment to a crashing halt, are so well designed they border on genius. I can overlook the sometimes questionable physics and the weird momentum quirks if the maps are fast-paced and exciting enough. Playing with friends, even if they just spectate, can be hilarious, and defeating a particularly trollworthy map feels epic beyond belief. Easy maps can make you look like some kind of genius player, and for all the bad luck you'll have, the occasional snatch of brilliant luck can make for a superb replay.\n\nTl;dr - flawed, occasionally super-hard well past the point of deliberate trolling, but extremely fun, engaging and exciting, with a very powerful level editor. It's the perfect way to kill a spare ten minutes. Or two hours.

I highly recommend this game, if you played and enjoyed older flash versions of this game. It's challenging platformer and it may seem hard at first, but it gets better, when you improve, but also harder levels will come and some maps in later rows was really hard even for me (I completed all N-reality and Nv2 metanet levels)\n\nStory is really simple: It's you (ninja) in a room full of enemies and your only goal is to get door key and get to door to continue your adventure in next level. You can either play through official episodes, where you need to complete 5 levels in a row to unlock next episode, or you can play user-created levels, which are in all forms of difficulty/playability.\n\nOfficial metanet levels are very good and mostly with fine difficulty. You can either just complete it, which is usually not too hard, but if you get better you can try to go for all gold runs, which are the real challenge, especially in some harder maps. Psychics and objects/enemies are well-thought out to make maps interesting to keep playing. There is enough content to play it for days and even if you complete all episodes, there are always some new cool userlevels. And it also has race mode and multiplayer co-op episodes. (Unfortunately you can only do co-op with 2 players on 1 computer) There are more enemies than in previous versions, some are really cool (Portal, that spawns evil ninja, who will chase you mirroring your moves and you die, if he catches you) You will soon figure best way to survive against certain enemies.\n\nI really like N++, it's better than older N games with lot more content, cool new enemies,  and lot of fun. Thanks metanet software for making this game, as I said I'm a long time fan of N the way of the ninja series. Probably only things I don't like much are that some levels are too hard  to get all gold for me, but I know it's supposed to be challenge. And when rocket crashes near you, you suddenly don't see anything and can easily make a mistake.\n\nIf you liked any older N game version, get N++ for sure, you won't regret it. And if you never played game like this before, try it too, it has simple old school graphics, but there is great amount of content for that price and lot of options, how to play the game. (Simply complete maps, go for all gold runs, or even try to go for episode/level highscores) \n", "timestamp_created": 1488644806, "timestamp_updated": 1488644806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30306101": {"recommendationid": "30306101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062228384", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508773225}, "language": "english", "review": "Childhood revisited :D", "timestamp_created": 1488595521, "timestamp_updated": 1488595521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505369", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30292130": {"recommendationid": "30292130", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973692343", "num_games_owned": 635, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499610795}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]N++ DOPEST PLATFORMER AROUND!!![/h1]\n\n[b]Presentation[/b]\nStraight from the get go this game has great aesthetics and an even better soundtrack. It builds upon the classic style dating all the way back to the first iteration of N but gives you a plethora of color pallets to choose from in a slick UI. Very minimalist but beautiful to look at none the less. The soundtrack suits the frenetic and super challenging gameplay well and is one of the best I have heard in recent years, up there with the likes of the more recent furi and timeless hotline miami series. \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nExpect to die a lot. This is the kind of game where you will die... again... and again. It demands perfection and when you get it right it just feels so good. The controls are momentum based and once you get used to them give you a lot of freedom to move around the level with certain restrictions that keep it challenging such as height and speed... I've killed myself running into a wall too fast.\n\n[b]Content[/b]\nIf you have played older versions of this and are wondering if you should pick it up or not... I would say if you are a fan absolutely. Its got all the levels from previous versions N and N+ and a whole slew of new levels, developer made and fan made. There is steam workshop integration with a built in level editor so essentially you will never run out of new things to play. It is the most complete version of the game and is packed to the brim with old and new content.\n\n[b]CONCLUSION[/b]\nThis is not an easy game but damn is it a fun game. The multiplayer, whether versus or coop, Is a blast. The single player seems endless with how many levels there are. It expands upon previous iterations on just about any way imaginable and it does what it does well.

Recuerda mucho a Super Meat Boy, es un plataformer 2D muy desafiante el cual cuenta con cientos y cientos de niveles los cuales en alg\u00fan punto har\u00e1n que te den ganas de tirar el mando por la ventana, puedes completar los niveles de la forma que m\u00e1s te convenga (Simplemente yendo hacia tu objetivo o consiguiendo todos los colectibles del nivel). Lo \u00fanico que echar\u00eda de menos ser\u00eda la genial banda sonora por parte de Danny Baranowsky, pero la banda sonora por parte de una gran cantidad de artistas de electr\u00f3nica tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 muy bien. Pero a\u00fan as\u00ed logra diferenciarse bastante bien, como por ejemplo en sus controles, los cuales no sientes que est\u00e1s corriendo con los pies huntados en mantequilla, y muchos de tus movimientos se basan m\u00e1s en controlar el \u00edmpetu de tu personaje que en hacer movimientos super precisos y viceversa.\n\nLos niveles se agrupan de a cinco por fase, lo cual est\u00e1 bien si quieres por ejemplo completar una fase por sesi\u00f3n y tal, pero hay algunas fases en las cual los niveles se hacen muy largos y querr\u00edas por ejemplo guardar para poder completar ese nivel en espec\u00edfico m\u00e1s tarde. No es muy molesto, pero quiz\u00e1s sea un contra muy importante para algunas personas. Tambi\u00e9n cuenta con multijugador local y dos modos de juego, lo cual de momento no he probado por que no tengo amigos :D, pero seguro tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 muy bien.\n\nCabe mencionar que los gr\u00e1ficos son geniales, cuenta con arte minimalista y colores planos los cuales puedes ir cambiando por nivel.\n\nY poco m\u00e1s que decir, si eres un fan\u00e1tico de los videojuegos de plataformas, este es un must-have.", "timestamp_created": 1488141002, "timestamp_updated": 1488141944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642857", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30195540": {"recommendationid": "30195540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198231637480", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "last_played": 1515790253}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing game", "timestamp_created": 1488114894, "timestamp_updated": 1488114894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30183391": {"recommendationid": "30183391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001254683", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507652784}, "language": "english", "review": "The skill ceiling for N++ is nuts, no matter who you are you'll inevitably hit levels that really challenge you, the music is good too.", "timestamp_created": 1488074604, "timestamp_updated": 1488074604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30179319": {"recommendationid": "30179319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054842361", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513602774}, "language": "french", "review": "Tr\u00e8s bon game design, bonne physique, bon sound design, rien \u00e0 dire", "timestamp_created": 1488060555, "timestamp_updated": 1488060555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30175467": {"recommendationid": "30175467", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081591082", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 816, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507410413}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would play again", "timestamp_created": 1488050178, "timestamp_updated": 1488050178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30170512": {"recommendationid": "30170512", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994431207", "num_games_owned": 723, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488662139}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely fantastic platformer.

I've played it for close to 100 hours.\n\nThere are a few negative reviews that raise some concerns. I'm going to boil them down to a few words and respond.\n\nToo hard: yes, the game is difficult, especially later on. That's the point. Like Super Meat Boy or other similar platformers, the game is easy-ish early on while you become comfortable with the controls and learn what all of the traps do. If you persist into the late game, you are going to die a lot, and you will spend absurd amounts of time on individual levels. But holy crap does it feel good to complete those levels.\n\nRepetitive, difficulty doesn't rise enough, physics feel wrong: these criticisms are decently fair, although I don't think the game is repetitive. This game has a LOT of levels, so getting to the most difficult levels will take some time. As for the physics: either you like them or you don't. The way it works is very deliberate, and it came to eventually feel great for me.\n\nFree similar flash games out there: I don't typically browse around the free available flash games out there, but as I noted above, there is an absurd amount of content in this game. And once you start getting into some of the hidden things, you'll really come to appreciate the level design. Everything is incredibly well-designed - you'll notice how perfectly places some traps are, which are meant to make you pay attention when you're trying to get through a level.\n\nI can't sing the praises of the game highly enough.", "timestamp_created": 1487957191, "timestamp_updated": 1487957191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500010", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30145781": {"recommendationid": "30145781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107376892", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477342663}, "language": "english", "review": "The N games are incredibly addicting!", "timestamp_created": 1487956457, "timestamp_updated": 1487956457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500010", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30145454": {"recommendationid": "30145454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245559834", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482719543}, "language": "english", "review": "BAN THIS GAME ITS TO GORY!!! xd me like", "timestamp_created": 1487955658, "timestamp_updated": 1487955658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500010", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30141367": {"recommendationid": "30141367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191816054", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503073558}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0430\u044f,\u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c.\u041f\u043e \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u044e \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u044b\u0439 n+ \u043d\u0430 psp,\u043d\u0443 \u0430 \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0447\u0443\u0434\u043e,\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0451 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u0441 super meatboy", "timestamp_created": 1487943966, "timestamp_updated": 1487944256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495060", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30140600": {"recommendationid": "30140600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085857391", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 208, "last_played": 1516223658}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the best platformer ever made, without question.

Fans of Super Meat Boy and the like will enjoy its hard difficulty and the insane amount of levels the game has to offer (2,360 of them, as a matter of fact, [i]not including user-made levels (!)[/i]). The physics can take a bit of getting used to, as N++ feels a little floatier than Super Meat Boy and other platformers, but gameplay is very fluid  overall. The pacing varies from level to level, ranging from careful and methodical planning to \"run-as-fast-as-you-freaking-can\", and resetting a level from the inevitable death or two (hundred) is almost instant. The art style is very crisp and not too busy for the eyes, and the range of colors that you unlock as you progress through the game give you something different to look at, which helps in changing things up and keeping the game looking fresh.\nTo top it off, the soundtrack is perfect for a game like N++. The soundtrack is an assortment of ambient IDM-style tracks which all manage to pull off the difficult task of giving the game atmosphere while not being distracting at the same time. Also, as mentioned above, there are user-created levels for those looking for a challenge or something new. N++ also has a cooperative mode and a competitive racing mode (local only).\n\nFor fans of the previous N games, this game is a no-brainer. This game is a must-have for fans of difficult platformer games.

It's as deep and as hard as you want it to be. There has never been a platformer with more rewarding physics.\n\n\nPlease forgive its sometimes-clunky menus.\n\n\nA couple things to be aware of:\n\n- The userlevel community is great! It's easy to just totally not notice behind the innocuous-looking \"Browse\" menu item, but making levels, playing new levels as they come in, and competing on the weekly featured levels are where I spend easily half my time with the game. Don't miss it!\n\n- If you care about high scores, which is a great thing to do, make sure you turn on the \"submit level scores\" option so you don't lose your level runs when you do full episodes.

We need more developers in the game industry that actually care what the community thinks. Kudos to you man!\n\nI was on the fence with this game.\n\nI played the first N+ for hours and absolutely loved it. Now that I've played this game for quite some time I will try to point out the main differences that I see and feel in the game as quickly as possible.\n\nControls:  \n-Jumping is inconsistent at times\n-Games seems more slippery(ie sliding into bombs when trying to stop)\n-Good news is you can jump on pointy geometry now\n\nObjects:\n-Missiles have a tighter turn radius, which was just annoying in my opinion\n-Bombs are bigger and have a active/inactive state to them\n-Bouncy Blocks are WAY different from the first game. Different point at which to jump to get maximum lift\n\nHit detection: This part I think is what frustrated me the most, apart from the controls not being consistent. I found that the top of your character is not really the top of your character.  It's almost as if your head doesn't count as part of your body. This is nice for some levels, but more frustrating than it is helpful.  You can no longer graze a switch with the top of your head and have it activate. Your movements need to be more explicit when hitting time and switches.\n\nCollecting Time: I found myself never needing to go after time which made the game easier than I was hoping. I can only remember 1 time when I NEEDED to get some time or I wasn't going to complete the level. Most of the challenging parts of the levels you can skip because they involve collecting time that your really don't need.  The only reason to go for it is to get higher on the leader board. \n\nThe developer did include the legacy levels from the first game in this one which I have to commend. \n\nOverall it's not a bad game, its just different from the first game in ways that are frustrating more than challenging and fun.\n\nI would recommend you buy this game on sale if you want a challenging platformer.", "timestamp_created": 1487735221, "timestamp_updated": 1487896525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499156", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30090466": {"recommendationid": "30090466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048901828", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504293870}, "language": "english", "review": "This particular game is found to be suitable to many people for playing, as it does implimant on standard game elements into a thrilling presentation by, such game elements that involve speed, concentration, and determination.

Ich hatte einen Plattformer im Stile von Super Meat Boy erwartet und war anfangs recht zufrieden damit. Die anf\u00e4ngliche Euphorie lie\u00df aber schnell nach und wandelte sich rasch in Frust. Viel zu viel Frust. \nStatt wie bei SMB so schnell wie m\u00f6glich von A nach B zu kommen, liegt der Fokus hier eher im Aufsammeln von \"Goldst\u00fccken\". Das w\u00e4re ja alles okay, wenn die Goldst\u00fccke auf dem Weg zu finden sind (einige der besseren Level in diesem Spiel machen es genau so), meist muss man aber irgendwelche absurden Spr\u00fcnge ausf\u00fchren, manchmal sogar mehrfach, weil man nicht alle Goldst\u00fccke auf einmal erwischen kann, was sich nat\u00fcrlich negativ auf den Spielfluss auswirkt. Das ganze kann man nat\u00fcrlich auch als Challenge f\u00fcr sich selbst interpretieren und wenn man keine Lust hat, kann man es auch lassen, sozusagen wird das Spiel schwerer je mehr man erreichen will. \nEin weiterer Makel des Spiels ist, dass es viel zu sehr auf Pr\u00e4zision setzt. Planung und Reaktionsverm\u00f6gen spielen nat\u00fcrlich immernoch eine Rolle, aber das alles nutzt nat\u00fcrlich nichts, wenn man die Spr\u00fcnge nicht so schafft, wie man es m\u00f6chte. Und die Steuerung ist, was das angeht, sehr empfindlich, was dazu f\u00fchrt, dass man st\u00e4ndig stirbt, ohne besser zu werden, weil man es einfach nicht schafft, den Sprung zuverl\u00e4ssig zu wiederholen.\nAuch das Leveldesign tr\u00e4gt zum allgemeinen Frust bei. Einige Level sind so gestaltet, dass man 4-5 mal quer durch den Raum h\u00fcpft, um Schalter zu dr\u00fccken, was eine triviale aber zeitaufwendige Aufgabe darstellt und zum Schluss kommt ein sehr schwerer Part an dem man h\u00e4ufig verreckt. Und dann muss man st\u00e4ndig erst den einfachen, zeitaufwendigen Part wiederholen, nur um dann wieder am viel zu schweren Pr\u00e4zisionssprung zu scheitern.\nAuch die Gegnerelemente im Spiel, also Raketen, verfolgende Killerscheiben, Todeslaser, Minen usw. sind anfangs gut integriert, in sp\u00e4teren Leveln aber riesige Frustquellen. Man ist in sp\u00e4teren Leveln einfach \u00fcberfordert mit der schieren Anzahl and Feindelementen auf dem Bildschirm, die einem auch viel zu kleine Reaktionsfenster lassen ( wo wir dann wieder beim Thema Pr\u00e4zision w\u00e4ren).\nDas solls zum Thema Gameplay sein. Die Musik im Spiel ist generische Elektromusik, gef\u00e4llt manchen vieleicht, mir nicht. Kann man ja zum Gl\u00fcck leise/stumm stellen und die eigene h\u00f6ren. Die Grafik ist sauber und simpel. Man sieht alles was man braucht, keine ablenkenden Elemente. Man kann jedoch neue Farbmuster freispielen, die meisten waren mit aber zu grell und haben mir in den Augen geschmerzt. W\u00e4re ja alles kein Problem, wenn das Spiel nicht automatisch beim Freischalten auf das neue Muster wechselt.\nFazit: Simple Grafik und Elektromusik, gepaart mit einem viel zu pr\u00e4zisionslastigen Plattformer, der keinen vern\u00fcnftigen Spielfluss hinbekommt.", "timestamp_created": 1486569162, "timestamp_updated": 1486569162, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.425069", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29769608": {"recommendationid": "29769608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049119297", "num_games_owned": 1254, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484603280}, "language": "english", "review": "Really, really cool game.

This game is awesome, let's just get that out of the way.\n\n2. The obvious comparison here is [i]Super Meat Boy[/i]. It is a tough indie platformer w/ about a million levels, many of which are insidiously, controller-chuckingly hard.\n\n3. The controls feel very different from Super Meat Boy though. They are super floaty and based on controlling momentum. It is hard to explain but the way your character controls at any exact moment depends somewhat on what you've been doing in previous moments. You need to not only think about how to pass the next obstacle but the one after that and the one after that.\n\n4. Also different from [i]Super Meat Boy[/i] is while that game pretends to have a plot--*spoiler* it doesn't really--N++ just says screw it and gives you a few paragraphs of text. I admire this purity of form.\n\n5. The artstyle for this is about perfect. Sprites are small and simple, allowing for fairly complex levels to fit all on one screen. You can see the whole thing and plan ahead and this plays well w/ the moment mechanic described in number 3. It also allows for user-changeable color schemes which is pretty cool in its own right.\n\n5. The soundtrack is also fairly well amazing: minimal techno that draws you in an you repeatedly attempts to finish the most difficult levels. \n\n6.  Each level is simple: hit a switch to open a door and get back to the door. Additionally, you can collect twinkling squares--referred to as gold--for additional challenge. Some levels are hard to beat on their own but you'll pick up the gold incidentally on the way. Some levels are easy to beat but hard to collect all the gold. Some levels are hard to beat and make it hard to collect all the gold. It adds variety. \n\n7. Levels are timed but I have never once ran out of time. This is because it's so easy to die. \n\n8. Levels are grouped into episodes, five levels per episode. This works really well for the flow of the game. Really hard levels are interspersed w/ more forgiving ones and you are rewarded regularly for finishing each episode.\n\n9. The big issue w/ 8--and my biggest issue w/ [i]N++[/i] generally--is that you cannot save in the middle of an episode. I dunno about you nerds, but I got things to do. Some of these levels can take quite a while to complete and I am not too keen on spending twenty minutes getting through the first four levels of an episode only to have something come up during the fifth, causing me to either loose my progress or have to leave the game running for however long I have to be away from my screen. I am not asking to allow me to save scum through the levels, just give me an option to save and quit to desktop so I don't lose my progress. When I start the game back up, let me continue from that save or start at the beginning of whatever episode I might want to play. \n\n10. You know what? Give me the option to save scum. It's a single player game. Who cares?\n\n11. For some reason, I found myself gravitating to the analog stick while playing this. There is a certainly fluidity to the controls that lead me to this. This is nice if you are playing on an Xbox style controller where the stick is more comfortable to grab than the d-pad (esp. on a 360 controller where the d-pad is balls). I couldn't use it 100% of the time but it still felt pretty good. \n\n12. Realistically speaking, you are never going to finish everything this game has to offer. If you are decidedly unrealistic and succeed at finishing the content provided by Metanet, there is getting to be a ton of user generated content which will you really never finish, esp. because a lot of it is awful. \n\n13. If you like platformers, find a way to play this. It is immediately comfortable and well-realized while being a strikingly fresh and new experience.

I played through the the free game and N+, way back, but this is the best version for sure. N++ is so damn hard!! But it's also fair:\n - The controls and precision are exemplary, some of the best ever\n - Every level is deterministic, so you can really practice your route\n - The difficulty curve is nicely done, and the game teaches you tricks as you play through it\n - The level design is often brilliant and there's tons of variety despite the fairly modest number of mechanisms in the game. Students of \"game design\" will enjoy N++ at an intellectual level.\n - Even the super hidden crazy challenges are all carefully thought out, so you're always confident it's possible.\n\nIt was a blast to get good at the game and to move around in the hyperdangerous levels like a ninja. I unlocked Mysteriousness (and did a few secret challenges), which was enough for me, and it took 48 hours of game time (though that is an overestimate since I had to leave the game on mid-episode while I did something else a few times). There's probably at least double that in the game, if I really wanted to punish myself. :)\n\nDownsides:\n - There are a couple of great songs on the soundtrack, but a lot of the music felt a bit too sparse/repetitive to me.\n - I don't like re-treading ground, and it's definitely possible to get yourself stuck by playing to the last level of an episode but not having enough time left to finish it. (I did this on E-19, which was quite annoying.) The fact that you can't restart an episode is part of what draws you in and punishes you into getting better, but IMO the game shouldn't let you get *stuck*.\n - I hate rockets!\n - On Windows it doesn't seem to work if I unplug my joystick and plug a new one in while the game is running.

It's your job to reach the door switch and get to the door with enough time left to complete the episode without dying in the process.\n\nThe ninja runs and jumps in the same way he has before. If you've played an N game in the past, you know how to play. New movement techniques are made apparent to you over the course of the levels naturally through smart level design. You'll learn how to effectively fly across levels, perform seemingly impossible feats of dexterity, and dodge every manner of obstacle as a matter of necessity. An impressive difficulty curve makes every episode (a set of 5 levels) just challenging enough to be fun without being frustrating. Different combinations of hazards and wall placements drastically change the approaches that can be taken in a level.\n\nCompletionists like myself will enjoy the gold-tracking included on the level selection screen. Each level has gold coins placed intentionally to provide a further challenge; getting all of them in a level marks the level with a coin, and getting all of them in an episode marks the episode with a coin, so you can easily see which episodes you've gotten all coins in and which levels need to be coin-completed to complete their episodes. Sometimes, getting all of the coins in a level is easy, and happens almost automatically as you make your way through. Other times, getting them all will make a level significantly harder as you're forced to put yourself into greater danger. Achievements track your gold collection for rows of 20 episodes, and also for completing rows without dying, which is a tall order indeed. \n\nAs I mentioned, collecting these coins extends your lifetime (the game timer) by two seconds each. Your lifetime is saved between levels within episodes and serves as your score upon episode completion. In games past, some levels have used the timer to put time pressure on the player aside from the pressure to get a higher score. I've yet to see any such levels in this game (I'm on the 35th episode of the second episode portion - details below).\n\nAs is par for the series at this point, included in the game are tons and tons of levels. The introductory portion of the game has 25 episodes and so 125 levels. There are two more portions after that with 100 episodes each, and therefore 500 levels each. That brings the total number of episodes in the game to 225 and the total number of levels to 1125. Each one is a joy to play and is satisfying to complete, as far as I've gotten. The third portion of levels looks to be made of levels from earlier games, and is titled \"Legacy.\" The true icing on the cake is that a level editor and community support are also included in the game, and already a vast multitude of levels have been produced. A near-infinite variety in level design exists for those willing to bring it about.\n\nMusic for the game is a sort of ambient, electronic style that fits well with the overall aesthetic of the game. It's quite unintrusive. The color scheme of the entire game can be changed at will with LT (or L-shift) within any menu, including the pause menu in-level.  There are 24 schemes to choose from, each of which changes the color of everything in the game, including all surfaces, hazards, coins, and menu items, and is unlocked as you complete more episodes. The color of the ninja and his headband can also be changed independently, though the colors they can be changed to are contingent on the selected overall color scheme. There are 4 options for ninja and headband color per color scheme. Additionally, there are 7 headband behavior options (and also an option for no headband) that slightly alter the physical appearance of the headband, which has no effect on gameplay. Players will find that different color schemes offer different levels of hazard visibility, which is an important consideration. There are enough options to choose from that there's no complaint to be made in that area.\n\nMy final remarks on the game will be on difficulty. This is a high-difficulty platformer, as the games before it have been. So far, I've played only a few levels that I think would pose a true challenge to players who have played each level before it. Of course, trying to get all the coins complicates the matter, but doing so is a conscious choice. Already, some levels have been brutally difficult to collect all of the coins in. I have no doubt that the kid gloves will truly be taken off as I reach the final episodes the game has to offer. Only those willing to push themselves to high peaks of performance will excel here.\n\nIn summary, N++ is a terrific addition to the N family that has done nothing but improve the N experience. Gameplay has remained almost completely unchanged, with only additions to the types of hazards encountered and the actual levels you navigate. The game looks awesome and plays phenomally, which is an absolute must for a hardcore platformer. I highly recommend N++ to all platformer fans.", "timestamp_created": 1484356314, "timestamp_updated": 1484357136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502307", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29235442": {"recommendationid": "29235442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065811995", "num_games_owned": 295, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502307110}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing platformer.

I guess I'll just play for as long as the return policy allows me... wait, how am I at five hours already?!\n\nFull - This game is a great example on how to do difficult platform games correctly. Minimalistic graphics and electronic music aside, this game excels in two key things: controls and level design. The controls are the more interesting of the two aspects. At first I found them to be both stiff and slippery at the same time, and I thought that gameplay would suffer massively because of it. Thankfully, I was proven wrong, as the controls are optimized for accurate air control, which you will be doing a lot of. This brings us nicely to the level design, which while difficult [naturally], accompanies the controls amazingly. Any deaths that occur are on you and any inaccuracies on your input, instead of insanely BS level design (even if it seems like that); the way it should be.\n\nThe game may be overtly difficult, but, lucky for you, you have unlimited lives. This allows you to run through the stages again and again to fine-tune your accuracy and speed, and maybe, just maybe, make it into the top 500 in the global scoreboards. Because of this, the game is extremely addictive: Be warned if you try to play this game within the return policy's limits [not that you'll need to use it here. :) ], you may run over if you really like it! \n\nOverall, I absolutely recommend this game if you need a break from the more complicated games available today, and just want to relax/rage/what-have-you with a simple to learn, but hard to master platformer. \n\nOn a last (but unrelated) note, this game won an award in 2015 for the best Canadian-made Game. Even if you didn't know that, if you died on the tutorial stages, your first achievement is \"You Suck, but that's Okay\".

Also, kinda limited ninja flavors.\n- Loads upon loads upon loads of (relatively) highly playable one-screen stages, each with their own gimmick.\n- An almost meditative three-hour soundtrack for your bullet-dodging needs.\n- Roughly three N games for the price of one, original color schemes included.\n\nCONS:\n- Despite the trailer claiming the game to be \"tough but fair but tough\", there's gonna be at least one level per episode which will make you think of the opposite. In fact, the farther you are in the game, the more hours you will spend on just one bloody screen trying to A) dodge a bunch of drones with barely traceable movement patterns, B) dodge a bunch of missiles, C) run away from deathballs who inevitably follow your path, D) dodge a fu\u0441kt\u043en of drones with barely traceable movement patterns, E) did I mention drones already?\n- The difficulty curve is pretty blurry and, to be fair, not as good as one would expect. It's indeed obvious that Metanet have put effort into trying to polish all ~2300 levels of the game, but even then...\n- Pretty questionable color choices for the palettes - so far, the most inaccessible color scheme is Console (unlocked way later in the game). It's even worse if you turn the visibility-enhancing outline off.\n- Considering how bumped up the difficulty of N++ is, compared to the sequels, it's kinda weird to not have mid-episode progress saving like the original N did. You know, that woulda helped.\n- The level editor still being quite disfunctional to use without a gamepad, even after the Halloween update.\n- The custom level hub is, in fact, more limited than Super Mario Maker. Like in that game, you're the only person online who can test your own bull level and once you post it on there, you can't delete it (it doesn't stay in the level editor for further fixing either); but unlike SMM, you don't have to actually beat the level in order to upload it (leading to a lot of babby's first levels involving instadeaths and other crap). Neither you can comment on these. Or heck, reporting those doesn't work either even though that's supposed to be a feature.

All you can do is run and jump...or that's all you have \"controls\" for. Where the game shines is the physics and how your speed can have a huge impact. Simply jumping in place might not get you anywhere but now go into a full run and suddenly you reach new heights...but oh, that's still not high enough? Well, you can jump off walls, essentially \"wall kicking\" like in Super Mario 64, but you can also press against the wall and slowly drag yourself down to slow your fall speed. Need that speed for a high jump on the other end of the level? Well, perhaps there's a ramp that you can safely land on at high speed to divert your momentum rather than splattering on a flat surface.\n\nThis is a game I didn't even know was in production. I played the original N (which is totally free from Metanet Software, so check that out if you're really not sure about this one) but I never knew they were working on a new one until I got an email sent for having an account on their website. N++ is everything the old N had and then some. The same familiar feel in a cleaner looking package, with more color options, more levels, and a huge soundtrack.\n\nWhen you are merely using 3 keys to control your character it feels greatly satisfying and fluid when you begin to master the physics of the game and pull off high speed wall kicks leading into other slick moves to gather all of the gold; which is something I haven't even mentioned yet! You have infinite lives, but each set of 5 levels are timed. The levels are just 1 screen and are full of traps, enemies, and gold. The gold increases the amount of time you have left and skipping too much of it may leave you without enough time to complete the last level. Getting all of the gold is generally the goal but it also allows you to essentially \"choose\" your own difficulty. Some of the early easy levels are very easy, but there may be a wealth of extra gold out of the way that you don't need to complete the level but you choose to get anyway for an all gold run. You always have the option to easily go back and play a set of levels over again. So if you don't feel you have the skills to do an all gold run, don't fret! You can always select those levels again right in the menu when you feel up for the challenge!\n\nLike the original N, N++ features a full level editor built right into the game, with access to all of the custom levels right in the games own menu. There are also leaderboards for all levels, even the tutorial and custom levels.\n\nIf you like fast paced platformers, especially if you are a masochistic completionist, I highly recommend this game! But if you are not a masochistic completionist, don't let that scare you, you can complete the levels without doing all the difficult gold runs, but you may just start to get a bit greedy yourself!", "timestamp_created": 1480792872, "timestamp_updated": 1480792872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500010", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28152005": {"recommendationid": "28152005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092621649", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499472660}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Platformer.", "timestamp_created": 1480734801, "timestamp_updated": 1480734801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500010", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28149917": {"recommendationid": "28149917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044412817", "num_games_owned": 932, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511550538}, "language": "english", "review": "It's simple, it's barebones, it has thousands of levels, and it may just be the finest example of platform game craftmanship ever.

This game requires a lot of precision, even more so than [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/40800/]Super Meat Boy[/url], in my honest opinion.

I don't know if I want to go that far.\nThose were key aspects to its underground cult following back then - these are key aspects in its successful sequels today. N+ and N++ helped to fine tune and overly polish the experience.\n\nNo online multiplayer? I don't see this as a problem. The original N never had any online multiplayer. N+ had it, but it would be a challenge to implement here because of latency and whatnot interfering negatively with the physics, that I can recognise. As a compromise, there is local multiplayer.\n\nA vastly challenging experience, not for the faint-hearted (and that is about the only possible con I see in this, that the difficulty could put off the most casual gamers). A LOT of handcrafted levels (and even more user-created levels). Great colour palettes. Brilliant licensed soundtrack that just about fits the mood of the game and whatever you're experiencing right now.\n\nIt is no wonder that this game was instantly deserving of my nomination for the \"I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award\" award.

For the most part, this is a fantastic edition of a fantastic core game.\n\nN++ is an energetic platformer that focuses on momentum above all else. Your score bleeds away every second and collecting gold increases the score. Technically if you run out of time you lose, but I have yet to encounter any levels that make that the serious threat it was in the original game.\n\nMost levels are less about whether or not you can complete the challenge (though some levels are hard enough for that to be a struggle) and more about how efficiently you can complete it. Few games have as engaging a sense of motion for me. This game captures the exhiliration of movement as well as a digital game can, and does so in two dimensions with minimalist artwork. It is an outstanding acheivement.\n\nThe soundtrack is hit and miss for me, but the wide variety of artists and tracks is impressive and when it hits it *really* hits. The interface is slick, the color skins are slick, the presentation is all around top-class though it would be nice to have a few more ways to view the leaderboards more arbitrarily.\n\nAnd now we come to my few complaints. Perhaps I'm suffering from selective memory but I feel like I encountered a wider variety of challenges and a wider mix of enemy types across playing the original levels. User-made levels can help make up for this, and there's a tightness of composition to the levels that really shines in places ... but sometimes that same tightness makes it that much clearer how to efficiently move through the level. More levels now feel like pure rote practice as opposed to having a bit of exploration and experimentation followed by rote practice to get the method you discovered down. Perhaps I've just played too muhc N, but I can figure out most of the tricks to the new levels the second the level starts and there are fewer \"aha\" moments as I encounter the weird quirks of the level's design at exactly the wrong moment.\n\nOn the one hand there are also fewer filler levels of just collecting gold pieces and going to the exit without substantive threat ... but on the other hand I've never found myself pressed for time in the later levels of an episode because I didn't do the earlier levels efficiently enough and that feels like as much a loss as a gain. Further, many levels that would otherwise occupy that filler level space in the original game merely add a rocket launcher or a chaser to make things significantly more challenging without being significantly more interesting.\n\nBut those are minor issues and I can fix them by jumping back to the original whenever I feel like it or by exploring user-made levels for either edition of the game.

Not to spoil anything, you literally cannot finish this game (and that's a good thing)\n  - It does not feel repetitive, each level brings something new\n  - Even going back to previous levels under different challenge requires different approach and makes them feel fresh\n  - Graphics are super sharp, adjustable and pleasing to the eye\n  - Music was to my liking\n  - Configurable colors yay! :)\n\nCons:\n   - I was late to work once because of N++. Almost twice.

"review": "Ahhh the N series... A hardcore simple-concept platformer that brings back many memories from playing n v1.2 during class, racing against some old friends to be the first to beat all the levels without ragequitting and destroying more keyboards than our allowences would allow for replacements. For anyone who did play the first version of n and are looking to reminice, good news! N++ is very much more of that plus some shiny new features to go along with it. If not, read one, but first, Pros vs Cons\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\nSimple platforming controls\nSimple and clean graphics\nHuge number of levels (2300+)\nBuilt in level editor + built in userlevel browsing\nLeaderboards\nFantastic music\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\nUI is slightly messy, difficult to navigate with mouse\n\nN++ is another, and apparantly the last entry in a momentum based platformer series that predates a lot of the other 'hardcore-hard' platformer games out there and it hasn't lost a bit of what makes the game good over the past 12 years. The premise of the game is that you are a ninja, ninjas like gold, and ninjas only live for 90 seconds in the absense of said gold. The narrative, like most of the rest of the game, is simple, and non-distracting.\n\nThe gameplay revolves around playing through a series of episodes, each containing 5 levels while only having 90 seconds to complete each episode. However, scattered around most of the levels in each episode are gold pieces that when collected add 2 seconds to your available pool of time to complete the episode. In most cases the gold is optional, but if you want any hope of competing on leaderboards you will need to collect as many if not all pieces along side of nearly perfect executing.\n\nAnd on the topic of execution, this game executes its simple gameplay masterfully. The movement is all momentum based, from running, jumping, and jumping off of walls/objects. Beating a level without keeping your momentum is possible for the most part, but the game really shines well when you try hold momentum for the entire level, while collecting as much gold as possible and not getting pommeled by any of the enemies (or slamming into any mines). Reaching max running speed takes a bit of time, mistiming jumps off of walls will reduce momentum, and most of your air control happens before you ever leave the ground. A very fine tuned system that offers a very high skill ceiling for people willing to shave milliseconds off of their level complete times.\n\nA system that is complimented well by it's level design. Every level takes place in spererate rooms that are all the same size, though the total playable area in each of these rooms can be much smaller. While not really offering anything amazing to the 2d platforming arena in regards to level mechanics, the wealth of available levels along with the difficulty of many of the later levels make up for it. Most of the levels follow a simple, less is better approach in that there is rarely a situation where you can not see how to complete a level before ever even starting it. With the exception of hidden mines and trap doors all the levels come down not to blindly attempting doors or jumps and instead urge you to focus purely on how you choose to execute it. That said, players will sometimes be rewarded if they can exectue perfectly timed jumps and high momentum moves with shortcuts or extra gold.\n\nGraphically the game is consistent in keeping with its simple themeing, but with that said, a lot of the themes seem too bright and or have too many clashing colors, but this is of course coming from someone who is used to playing the standard dark gray on light gray theme from the first game. No fancy textures, no crazy lighting effects, just simple, minimalist, and clean cut colors to comprise the floors and walls of each room you will find yourself in.\n\nMusically the game is fantastic as well, featuring a pounding drum-n-bass soundtrack that goes well with its gameplay. I actually wish there was an option to buy the soundtrack as well.\n\nThe built in level editor offeres for even more playability after completing the 2300+ levels including in the base game, though the editor is still a bit wonky, espeically compared to the one from the original game, though all the tools are there and it is still possible to make all kinds of brutal levels to punish the rest of the players with.\n\nTo summarize, N++ is another solid entry to the n series, offering way more levels than previous games, but still retaining that clear, simple-yet-hard gameplay approach that made this series what it is today. And the developer support for the game is strong to boot.", "timestamp_created": 1479948845, "timestamp_updated": 1480983095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500010", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26962882": {"recommendationid": "26962882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025641858", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512846423}, "language": "german", "review": "Die Nutzerwertungen sprechen f\u00fcr sich.\nEwig viele Level, dedizierter Coop-Modus, ein wahnsinnig guter Soundtrack und alles, was die alten Teile auch schon gut gemacht hat.

You move around in a 2D plane, as you might expect from a platfomer, but perhaps more unusually every level is contained within a single screen and as such no side-scrolling is present. Every level is a static piece of art save for some rather deadly enemies which move according to simple and predictable yet are often used in deviously challenging ways.\n\nYou control a stickfigure ninja with a wealth of different moves despite only having three buttons of control - left, right and jump. This is because he interacts with the environment in a physically simulated way and the same inputs will cause different effects depending on whether you're touching a floor, a slope, a wall or nothing at all. Mastering these interactions and the changes in the player's momentum that follow is key to surviving the increasingly difficult challenges the game throws at you. \n\nAnd oh boy are there many challenges. The game sports more than 2000 levels, many of which have additional challenges that will take even the most experienced veteran of the game hours to beat. If you ever run out of official content to play (unlikely) there are also highscore leaderboards to compete on and a great level editor with online level sharing.\n\nPros:\n+the most satisfying movement mechanics in all of gaming\n+massive amount of content\n+no skill ceiling\n+welcoming community\n+beautiful visuals with lots of color options\n\nCons:\n-locked to 60fps\n-updates have been slow so far (as of November 2016)\n-I'm not a fan of the soundtrack\n\nConclusion: This is my favorite video game of all time.

N 2.0 came out, and I thought it was a pretty good update to N 1.4, but it was still quite obviously the same game.

You can however change the theme of the game, giving everything new colors, but the color of your ninja is dependent on the theme.

For that alone I would have passed some money the developer's way, but N++ is definitely worth it by itself.  It's a tough, unforgiving platformer in the mould of Super Meat Boy (or vice versa, given how old N is).  It has a peculiar momentum-based approach to platformer (screw physics!).  Once you get the hang of it, you'll be performing incredible walljumps and near-flying around levels.  There's a huge amount of levels to play; 9 hours in and I've barely completed half of them.\n\nIf I have one complaint, it's the adjustment in approach from N.  In N and N++ you have gold which you can collect to extend your forever-reducing timer.  In N, you had to go out of your way to collect gold to give yourself enough time to complete episodes (sets of 5 levels).  The only question was on which level you were going to divert to make sure you had enough time for later levels.  In N++, you can complete every episode (that I've played so far -- including several in E, the toughest category) without worrying about the timer.  You collect lots of gold easily on your way round, and you never have to worry about the time.  The gold is just if you want to get a high-score.  I can understand that this is a new approach: always completable but you can go back for high scores, but it means an episode is just an independent set of 5 levels. I miss the tension that the timer added in N.\n\nStill, recommended if you like games that kill you brutally every 2.3 seconds, but after one button press you're up and running again.  This time, you can avoid that mine. This time, you can jump over the missile.  This time, you got killed by a machine gun. But next time, next time was the mine.

Some amazing games are 10-hour experiences, 20 if you replay and look for everything. This is the game built to last a lifetime. It does this by a number of vectors: \n\n1) a ridiculously high skill celing with open ended parkour-style gameplay which means that already open-ended levels offer an almost infinite continuum of routes, shortcuts and stunts you can pull off (despite being a three button game). Good games show off how creative the level and game designers are; timeless games let the player show off their own creativity in gameplay.\n\n2) A TON of levels, thousands of them, multiple goals and playstyles (all gold, highscore, speedrunning, local multiplayer, lots of secret missions and unlockables) and that all important level editor with online sharing and leaderboards. This, combined with an extremely rich and finetuned movement and gameplay design means the game literally never ends. You can always get better, you can always play new levels, and you can always make new levels.\n\n3) The online leaderboards which I mentioned before mean you can always get better at any level, and doing so gives you tangible rewards - replays that you can watch and of course that sweet, sweet highscore on the leaderboard. This drives the community to push the envelope with regards to creative routing through the level and to find ever more ways to speed the ninja up.\n\n4) The aforementioned finely-tuned gameplay. There are lots of platform games around, but none of them have the unique feel of N, and by extension, N++. Use your momentum to fling yourself around the screen, over huge chasms, around loops, up mountains and down into deadly caverns. Walljumping off of slopes, curves and (of course) walls, plus the interactions with level geometry and objects creates an endless variety of tricks to invent, discover and master.\n\nImagine the visceral thrill and speed of Sonic, the constant forward-planning and puzzle platforming of Lode Runner, and the challenge of Meat Boy only much more scalable due to you being able to set your own goals in the game. No other game can make me wince, scream, uncontrollably jump out of my seat or curse the level designer and call them horrible things like N++. No other game has a movement physics so precise that you can almost feel your character touching the walls and grazing past deadly mines.\n\nWith no scrolling, no fancy graphics or decorations, no storyline and no real mystery, each level gives you a god's-eye view of every trap, every enemy and every platform. Planning forwards becomes essential to weave in and out of enemies, what seems impossible eventually becomes second nature. You will level up as a player, not a character; and you will learn to cope with extreme stress and continue to press on against an overwhelming feeling of hopelessness.\n\nFinally, the presentation is a perfect melding of form and function, inspired by minimalist art, op art, technical diagrams, floor plans of buildings and architecture in general, the vector graphics and contemporary colour schemes are complimented by the smoothest framerate and literally perfect controls. Polish drips off of the game like one of those glossy magazines.\n\nOne of the timeless games, and the best skill-based platformer ever devised, taking the art of platforming down to the level of a sport and, dare I say it, a passion.\n\nSendy", "timestamp_created": 1475000797, "timestamp_updated": 1475000818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.761129", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25720089": {"recommendationid": "25720089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052387228", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476599740}, "language": "english", "review": "It's just like N from the glory days of flash games, but bigger and better.\nLike, \"level creator possibilities\" bigger and better.\nNow go ninja.

Not like your typical type hard, it's diabolical.  It starts you off easy and then immediately goes straight into the ass plunging.  You think you're good?  Think again.  This game redefines what it means to be a good video game player.  Take your sissy pants off, get on your hazmat gear, and get to grinding.  I've screamed in angry delight many times and have easily clocked 6000+ deaths, and yet, I'm still playing.  Am I ret@ard?  Probably.  Am I sane?  Not likely.  But I can assure you that any person with a mental illness will heavily enjoy this game.  If you have OCD, then you'll probably rip your hair out after the 30th hour of gameplay, but who needs hair anyways, it's overrated.\n\nThe long of the short, get this game if you like insanely difficult, yet satisfying 2d platforming action.  Yes, you will collect plenty of gold, none of which you can keep in the real life.  And yes, you will die, countless times.  Your ego will be bruised, tattered, and perhaps obliterated as a result of this game.  You think waiting behind a standstill in rush-hour is frustrating, try getting all of the gold in a difficult level and dying seconds before the exit.  It'll bring your pi$$ INSTANTLY to a boil.  But yet....again, I keep playing.....why?!?  Why God?  Why must I be punished in such a sickly enjoyable way.\n\nRamblings aside, get this game.  Don't be a loser.  Stop standing on the sidelines hoping that you'll one day grow the balls to handle this ride, because it just ain't going to happen.  Pull out your wallet, get your $hit together, and shoot for the stars.  And if you don't reach them, at least you'll hit a strategically placed mine or rocket along the way.

It was a free to play platformer that introduced a new style to the platforming genre. Unlike Mario N was a single screen platformer that had the player generating moves to keep up momentum to jump higher, farther, and overall faster. It also had a small puzzle mentality to it as well, such as waiting for the perfect time, opening a certain lock first, taking a particular path ect... The enemies were different as well, some that were passive and others that were aggressive and chased the player. This style gave us the beginning of a series that would redefine the platforming genre.\n\nA few years later in 2008 N+ was released on the XBLA (Xbox Live Arcade) store. At a glance it looked as if it was the same game from 2004 just with new levels and better graphics but you'd be wrong. It also added what many from the N community would say was the best decision they've ever made, Multiplayer... Now you and your friends could play a level together and complete the game together either through local co-op OR online play! This plus the addition of co-op levels, races, plus playing levels you and your friends created just added to the already amazing game play and made it more fun as well as chaotic!\n\nAnd now in 2016 N++ continues the legacy of the N series and again Improves on the fantastic game play! N++ now has new enemies such as the evil Ninja who follows your exact footsteps from 2 seconds ago as well as a ball of death that chases you down. N++ also adds new colors to the game to keep it fresh and gives it more eye candy as well. N++ adds another new feature which is the ability to browse levels made by anyone in the world where unlike N+ you could only play levels made by your friends.\n\nNow I know my review makes this game sound like the best game ever but unfortunately N++, while again improved from the last two games lacks one thing that made N+ one of the funnest platformers I've ever played, and that is online multiplayer... While co-op and racing levels are still in the game you can't play these with your friends online, you'll have to be in the same room together in order to do so. This saddens me due to the fact that if this game had multiplayer many more people would buy this game and it would also extend the life of this game too. HOWEVER, this is the only con that this game has. Don't let this one feature stop you from buying this amazing platformer, there's still a lot you can do on your own. And who knows, maybe they'll add online multiplayer to the game (one can only hope so :p).\n\nSo in conclusion, N++... Still my number 1 platformer and still a whole helluva lot a fun!\n\n10/10 would N++ again and forever!!!\n", "timestamp_created": 1474328918, "timestamp_updated": 1493351477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25591701": {"recommendationid": "25591701", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025299025", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "last_played": 1515545019}, "language": "english", "review": "Was playing this game back when it was just a popular flash game, so I'm really happy it's now on steam.

With the tech available to game developers now, one would think there'd almost be an expectation to make hyper-realistic and fluidly animated third-person cover shooters that probably only run at a cinematic 24 frames per second on most computers. The appeal of a 2D platformer is that it is - and almost always will be - extremely self-explanatory. Upon launching N++, it will take most people under 30 seconds to have everything figured out. It's the age-old mantra of 'easy to learn, hard to master' that so many genres will simply never be able to get right.\n\nThat said, it could be argued that the reason [i]N++[/i] is so simple to learn is because of its apparent fear of doing anything to differentiate it from the rest of the genre as a whole. To hone in on the problem, one should look to the previous instalments of the series. Originating as a free 2004 browser game, simply titled [url=http://www.thewayoftheninja.org/nv2.html][i]N[/i][/url], the title was later released as on Xbox Live Arcade as [i]N+[/i], including the addition of a well-received online multiplayer component. With the release of [i]N++[/i], it becomes pretty clear that developer Metanet Software isn't going to budge. The obscure titling begs the question: is this a sequel or a remake? The fact that all the levels are different per game says sequel, but the fact that the gameplay is perfectly identical screams 'stand-alone DLC'. Which is truthfully what [i]N++[/i] probably should have been. It shows no characteristics of an entirely new game, and doesn't feel like a great investment if you've already played the previous two games.\n\nBy itself, [i]N++[/i] is a great game. The gameplay is smooth and the minimal graphic style is sleek and professional. As with the previous games, it strikes a solid balance between fair and frustrating, and the local multiplayer modes are a blast with friends, including a tough-as-nails co-op mode in which both players are all but required to play at peak performance to complete the specifically designed levels. Race mode is by far the most enjoyable, as it lends an element of speedy precision that's missing from the solo levels thanks to a jump button so floaty that it's practically a feature.\n\nThe acclaimed online multiplayer is notably absent this time around, and criticism by fans was met with excuses stinking of the procrastinatory air that hangs over the product. It feels like the words 'can't be bothered' must have been uttered frequently during development, because it is quite literally a shiny new coat over an 11-year-old game that can still be played for free online.

Over the years N went on to receive several updates, won 2 audience choice awards and managed to capture people's attention due to its simple game mechanics, addictive quality and unforgiving nature. Surprisingly it managed to capture the attention of a Microsoft employee and from there the second game, N+, was born. N+ came onto the Xbox 360 in 2008 boasting new levels, refined visuals, tweaked sounds, an actual soundtrack, customisation and local as well as online co-op. I loved it, and so did many others I imagine, but even with a later Nintendo DS and PSP release... the developers still didn't have enough money for a proper PC or PS3 port. Thankfully the developers heard our pleas, and after a deal with Sony was accepted, N++ for PS4 (and later PC) was given full approval.\n\nN++ is a solid platformer through and through. The aim of the game is to navigate the agile ninja to a switch and then to the accompanying exit in each level. This sounds simple, and it is, but you\u2019ve also got a rather short lifespan (represented by a timer ticking down to 0 at the top of your screen) which can be extended by optionally picking up gold. As you go through the 25 \u201cIntro\u201d episodes: new enemies are introduced and the levels become harder too. Knowing how long to press the \u201cZ\u201d button (which determines how long/high you jump), when to wall-jump and how much momentum you need is absolutely vital to succeeding in this game. And that\u2019s what I love about this game. The controls are slick, and everything feels responsive, so the only thing you can blame when everything goes wrong is yourself and tear what remaining hair you have left on your head.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=756531073\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 the game\u2019s accessible to everyone. Extra challenge however comes from players attempting to collect all the gold in each level or getting the fastest time. Heck, I spent a good quarter of my playtime just trying to compete with my Steam friends for the best leaderboard position and global rank. What's neat is that you can actually watch your friend's replays to see how they beat a certain level. If replaying levels is not your thing though, N++ has got you covered. Remember when I said that the \u201cIntro\u201d section had 25 episodes? Each episode actually contains 5 levels and there\u2019s 100 more episodes in the \u201cN++\u201d section. If you finish that, there\u2019s another 100 episodes (which are all old maps from previous N games) in the \u201cLegacy\u201d section. So altogether that\u2019s 1125 levels and this is just the \u201cSolo\u201d mode. That\u2019s right! There\u2019s also the \u201cCo-op\u201d (only local co-op in this game) and \u201cRace\u201d modes to look forward to, so you won\u2019t be finishing any time soon.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=760447750\n\nOutside of all of this there\u2019s a level editor for you to play around with which is amazing. What\u2019s even better is you can play levels made with this on the PS4 version and vice versa. The icing the on the cake is \u201cFunlocks\u201d though, which are little bonuses you can unlock (they\u2019re mostly extra colours which change the look of the menus and the levels themselves). Other things worth mentioning include the soundtrack \u2013 it\u2019s not overpowering and fits the game\u2019s aesthetic perfectly \u2013 and the excellent port. While some PC gamers may be annoyed about the fact that the game\u2019s locked to 60 FPS, it\u2019s more than playable for me and I assure you that everything is super smooth. I personally would like an option to unlock the framerate but apparently this was done so everyone's replays would be the same.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=760447575\n\nThat's all I can really say about this game, and I'm actually surprised this didn't end up being a longer review, but all I'll say is this: N++ is absolutely worth it. It's a 9.5/10 for me. Pick it up when you can... you will not be disappointed.\n\n\n\n[h1]P.S.

O jogo conta tamb\u00e9m com FUNlockables, op\u00e7\u00f5es secretas que s\u00e3o liberadas em circunst\u00e2ncias espec\u00edficas, como pegar todo ouro em v\u00e1rios epis\u00f3dios de uma mesma coluna.\n\nQuando voc\u00ea tiver terminado todas as fases (ou melhor ainda, quando estiver preso numa delas e cansar), poder\u00e1 utilizar sua criatividade para criar suas pr\u00f3prias fases, utilizando o editor que vem dentro do pr\u00f3prio jogo. \u00c9 muito f\u00e1cil publicar sua fase ao termin\u00e1-la - e da mesma forma, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel encontrar milhares de fases feitas por outros jogadores.\n\nO jogo possui pouqu\u00edssimos comandos: a movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o do personagem \u00e9 feita com as setas do teclado, e a tecla Z \u00e9 utilizada para pular.\n\nApesar da simplicidade nos comandos, a complexidade do jogo come\u00e7a com a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de leis da f\u00edsica no personagem, que permitir\u00e3o movimentos pouco comuns e dif\u00edceis de serem executados.\n\nPra come\u00e7ar, \u00e9 vis\u00edvel observar o poder da acelera\u00e7\u00e3o do personagem, que notavelmente causar\u00e1 um impulso em toda movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o do personagem.\n\n\u00c9 poss\u00edvel tamb\u00e9m ter um controle a\u00e9reo, mudando a dire\u00e7\u00e3o de um pulo, ou alterando a velocidade de deslocamento horizontal. Claro, tudo de forma gradativa, respeitando a acelera\u00e7\u00e3o ninja do personagem.\n\nO desafio \u00e9 combinar o controle da acelera\u00e7\u00e3o do personagem em uma seq\u00fc\u00eancia cont\u00ednua, utilizando a f\u00edsica a favor da sua movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e os movimentos avan\u00e7ados para ganhar uma alt\u00edssima velocidade, tudo isso tentando controlar o m\u00e1ximo poss\u00edvel a trajet\u00f3ria do personagem.\n\nEm todas as fases, o objetivo principal \u00e9 sempre o mesmo: tocar o interruptor que ir\u00e1 abrir a porta da sa\u00edda, e alcan\u00e7ar a porta aberta para encerrar a fase. Isso, tendo um limite de 90 segundos para passar das 5 fases do epis\u00f3dio.\n\nA maioria das fases ter\u00e1 um ou mais obst\u00e1culos letais: campos minados, lan\u00e7a-m\u00edsseis teleguiados, raios lasers, rob\u00f4s assassinos, clones fantasmas, enfim, n\u00e3o faltar\u00e3o obst\u00e1culos nas fases, que sempre resultar\u00e3o na morte do personagem. Felizmente, morrer no jogo \u00e9 algo comum e corriqueiro, resultando apenas na fase atual sendo reiniciada.\n\nO jogo tem um estilo visual extremamente minimalista, com poucas cores e sem texturas, com linhas severas e alto contraste. Por\u00e9m, as anima\u00e7\u00f5es do personagem s\u00e3o muito bem detalhadas e flu\u00eddas, tornando o jogo extremamente agrad\u00e1vel de se ver.\n\nA parte sonora do jogo \u00e9 extremamente rica: s\u00e3o 63 m\u00fasicas eletr\u00f4nicas, criadas por artistas variados, resultando num total de mais de 6 horas de m\u00fasicas diferentes.\n\nO jogo conta com suporte a at\u00e9 4 jogadores locais em todos os seus modos de jogo. Para adicionar jogadores, basta apertar as teclas F2/F3/F4 na tela de sele\u00e7\u00e3o de epis\u00f3dios, conforme indicado no canto superior direito.\n\nJogando cooperativamente, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 respawn: quando um jogador morre, dever\u00e1 esperar que seus companheiros completem a fase, ou morram. Caso fique apenas um jogador vivo, os jogadores mortos podem apertar a tecla de suic\u00eddio para for\u00e7ar o rein\u00edcio da fase.\n\nQuando a coopera\u00e7\u00e3o cansar, os jogadores poder\u00e3o aproveitar o modo race, onde dois ou mais jogadores ir\u00e3o apostar corrida nas fases.\n\nBasicamente, os jogadores come\u00e7am no mesmo ponto, e o objetivo \u00e9 tanto pegar o ouro quanto terminar a fase vivo. Ao terminar a fase, os jogadores que conclu\u00edram ela ganhar\u00e3o pontos, baseado no tempo que levaram.\n\nFato: N++ \u00e9 o melhor jogo de plataforma para quem curte testar ao m\u00e1ximo sua velocidade e seus reflexos. A jogabilidade do jogo, atrelada a sua f\u00edsica, garantem uma jogabilidade intuitiva, por\u00e9m dif\u00edcil de ser dominada.\n\nA op\u00e7\u00e3o de cooperativo certamente foi um dos conceitos principais dessa vers\u00e3o do jogo, enriquecendo muito a experi\u00eancia para quem quer jogar acompanhado, tanto cooperativamente quanto em competi\u00e7\u00e3o. Divers\u00e3o garantida!\n\nCertamente n\u00e3o \u00e9 um t\u00edtulo recomendado para jogadores mais mais casuais e sem habilidade, mas mesmo assim, a crescente das fases da campanha ir\u00e3o treinando gradativamente o jogador para desafios maiores.", "timestamp_created": 1473388649, "timestamp_updated": 1473388649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.716137", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25417496": {"recommendationid": "25417496", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009974770", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 1437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514413316}, "language": "english", "review": "God-tier platformer.", "timestamp_created": 1473373488, "timestamp_updated": 1473373488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500010", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25410959": {"recommendationid": "25410959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048085449", "num_games_owned": 753, "num_reviews": 206, "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473342322}, "language": "english", "review": "https://youtu.be/PhPimtEEBts\n[i]Game:[/i] N++ (NPLUSPLUS)\n[i]Genre:[/i] Indie Platformer\n[i]Developer:[/i] Metanet Software Inc.\n[i]Publisher:[/i] Metanet Software Inc.\n[i][u]Copy supplied by PCGN[/u][/i]\n\n[b]N++[/b] is an indie platformer developed and published by Metanet Software Inc. This is a very simple game to review, since seeing some gameplay explains everything.\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]\nThe minimalist graphics, powered by OpenGL 3.3, are polished and smoothly animated. The performance is quite solid, and there are plenty of options to play around with.\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nThe game is a straight-forward platformer. There are multiple blocks that contain 5 levels where your goal is to get to the exit. It starts off pretty simple, but the more you play, more traps, enemies and challenges are introduced, keeping the experience always fresh.\nThere are also two overlooked game modes that are worth buying the game for alone: Co-op and Race. In Co-op, you and other three players must cooperate to get at least one of you to the end of the level, and the sacrifice of at least one of them is necessary. In Race, you and other three players try to reach the end of the level as fast as possible while also capturing the yellow dots to increase your final score.\n\n[h1]CHALLENGE[/h1]\nThe game is very damn hard, and sometimes quite frustrating. Some traps are very overpowered, and trying to pick up every yellow dot to increase your score is going to require a lot of patience and focus.\n\n[h1]SOUND[/h1]\nThe electronic soundtrack is very good, with a couple of memorable tracks that improve the experience.\n\n[h1]REPLAYABILITY[/h1]\n2360 levels. Level Editor. Co-op. 26 Steam Achievements. There is plenty of content that will keep you coming back for more.\n\nOverall, this is a solid, challenging and content-rich puzzle platformer that, while not fully enjoyable, is still highly recommended for the quality of its platforming and the great co-op mode and level editor.\n\n[h1]Story: n/a\nGraphics: 7.5\nGameplay: 8\nChallenge: 10\nSound: 8\nReplayability: 9\n\n[b]ENJOYMENT: 7.5\nFRUSTRATION: 8[/b][/h1]\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_VuBkttXIrpbrxwfYL_B-w]Subscribe to my channel[/url]\n[url=http://www.facebook.com/EnjoyTheGaming]Like on Facebook[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EnjoyTheGaming]Join my Steam group[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1473343309, "timestamp_updated": 1473343309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25405616": {"recommendationid": "25405616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037393879", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479812184}, "language": "english", "review": "Good one.", "timestamp_created": 1473303395, "timestamp_updated": 1473303395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500010", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25399551": {"recommendationid": "25399551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014198791", "num_games_owned": 522, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 1516182973}, "language": "english", "review": "N has been available for a long time (since 2004 I believe) for free on the internet. It's a fantastic game and if it's your type of game you can easily sync hundreds of hours into the title. It is not for everyone though. Most platformers have a sense of progression, a going from point A to B if you will. You are trying to rescue the princess or defeat an evil presence. This game however is much more....Arcadey in its approach. There is just a crapload of levels and aiming for highscores is encouraged. It's not so much about beating the game but doing as well as you possibly can. The backbone that makes N such a joy to play however is its movement system. It's really built around building up momentum and maintaining it in order to make improbable jumps and landings. It takes a little while to get a hang of but once you do it's the best feeling platformer of all time in my humble opinion. \n\nSo that's N. If you have your doubts about it its free to play in your browser right now! Just Google N the Ninja and you are good to go.\n\nBut if N is free is it worth paying money to play N++? Absolutely!\n\nThink about it this way. Imagine you are  in class and Prom is coming up. There's a nerdy chick in the class who is kinda cute and has a great personality but she wears glasses and her hair is always up in an unattractive bun she has braces, wears a frumpy jumper etc. But she invites you to the Prom and you are like, yeah sure fine. It won't be too bad you guess. And then you show up and your jaw hits the flaw. This girl looks absolutely stunning in her dress, her hair is long and shiny, her braces are gone, she looks like a supermodel now! You just can't believe the transformation! You just can't stop pinching yourself about how lucky you are to be at Prom with her!\n\nThat is what the difference  between N and N++ is. N++ is just a more polished experience than N in every way imaginable. The game looks beautiful in its minimization. The music fits the game amazingly well. The levels are more refined and there are more of them. \n\nWhich isn't to say that it's a perfect game. Most of the problems stem from the reality that it's a PS4 port. So for example the game won't run faster than 60fps for those of you with high refresh monitors. Or the built in level editor is more built around a controller rather a keyboard and mouse. But just like when you get this girl home from Prom and strip her naked you find a small pimple on her bottom are these small blemishes really going to stop you from enjoying yourself? Are you really going to regret your decision? I really, really don't think so.\n\nSo if you enjoy the game N do yourself a favour and take it to the damn Prom already. You really won't regret your decision.

Tons of fun, tons of content, tons of homicidal robots, no lives, up to four ninjas. It can be frustrating at times, but you'll never feel like you died in an unfair way. \n\nThe gameplay is mostly focused on an extremely polished jumping system that takes into account momentum, speed and angles, making the game pretty hard to handle for the first time, even harder to master, but really satisfying once you are able to pull out your parkour skills. Your goal ? Unlock the exit and get out of here with as much gold as possible.\n\nThe game have also two multiplayer modes : the first one is a competitive race mode while the other one is a cooperation mode. The game also gives you a level editor to  make and share your levels all around the world. You can also play other people's levels, on PC as well as on PS4.\n\nThere's a couple of bad points though : first, no online mode. If you want to play multiplayer it'll be on the same PC, likely with up to four people sharing the same keyboard. It's okay when you're just two but when you're four it can become a bit messy. Another issue is that the game can become a bit repetitive : most of what you'll do is jumping around after all.\n\nAnyway, N++ is definitely a game I would advise you to buy, especially if you're a fan of hardcore platformers like Super Meat Boy. It's excellent gameplay, great level design and incredble replay value makes N++ one of the best PC games of 2016.", "timestamp_created": 1472748325, "timestamp_updated": 1472748325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579839", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25288176": {"recommendationid": "25288176", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063690797", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480015594}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Oyunun trailerini g\u00f6r\u00fcnce bile \u00e7ok sevdim teredd\u00fct etmeden sat\u0131n ald\u0131m .

Years later, I think around 2010, I had pretty much forgotten about it. However, while browsing my local GameStop, I noticed a small DS game called N+. I immediately remembered my time playing the original flash game, and picked that box up to bring to the counter immediately. It was full of great danger, a tough challenge, and even had the original flash graphics as an option (or at least a replica that the DS could actually pull off). I spent hours on that game, and it's still one of my favorite DS games, and what I considered the gold standard of pure platformers.\n\nNow we have another N game, which I immediately jumped on the opportunity to buy the second I found out about it (by selling a bunch of TF2 and Dota stuff that I don't use). I'll be comparing this to N+ DS a lot since that's the one I have the most experience with, so when I mention N+, it'll be referencing the DS version and not the PSP or 360.\n\nI am definitely enjoying this game so far, and for the sake of information, I'll repeat the same shit everyone else has said. The controls are dead on, I use an Xbox 360 controller to play and it reads all my button inputs perfectly. It's a bit annoying that I can only navigate menus with the D-Pad since gameplay and the level editor allow/require the joystick(s) respectively.\n\nThe music is nice, though I found myself having to mute it after a while due to the style while wearing headphones. It's not the music's fault, I just get a headache if I listen to that kind of pumping EDM stuff for too long, so I play with headphones off. It would be awesome if I could add in music from my own library or if the music from all the versions of N+ (but mainly the DS version ^_^) were in the game as unlockables, or even DLC if need be (I'd pay for the DS music in a heartbeat).\n\nThe legacy episodes are nice too. I noticed a few levels from N+ on the in some of the episodes I haven't unlocked yet, though with the physics being closer to the original N than N+.\n\nNow for my gripes:\n\n- No Tag or Domination multiplayer modes for us DS ninjas. I loved Domination in N+ and I'd love to see it return so I could do that without needing someone else to have their own game card. I have no real problem with no online multiplayer since I don't care much for online in a game like this. If it gets added in at some point, that's all well and good, but I just want my Domination mode back. :'(\n\n- The initially ran slower on my computer than it should, but I was able to fix it. Apparently turning off V-Sync fixes the problem, though it didn't initially work for me. I ended up fumbling with the window size a bit, and when I re-fullscreened it, [b]BAM![/b] Glorious full speed. \n\n- This is pretty minor, but the level editor has a lot fewer possible blocks than the DS version. Seriously, the kinds of shapes you can create in N+ DS is crazy. I actually tried to re-create one of my old custom levels and I had to make a lot of changes because the shapes I used don't exist in this version.\n\n- To my knowledge, you can't set the graphics to the original flash graphics, I just don't see the same charm in these new graphics that I do in the simple flash graphics. I had similar feeling towards the Plus graphics in the DS version, but I could swap to the original graphics in that. Some of color schemes are also a bit too colorful for my tastes, but there are enough of them to mitigate that issue.\n\nOther than those, this game turned out pretty good. I'll probably update this review later and give a much more informed opinion after I've cleared at least half the episodes. I still like N+ more, but once I've spent more time on this game, that opinion has a chance to change.\n\nEDIT: Still like the DS version more, but this is still damn good.", "timestamp_created": 1472596259, "timestamp_updated": 1479951318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540933", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25258249": {"recommendationid": "25258249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058873996", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510777592}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 lost my sanity", "timestamp_created": 1472596108, "timestamp_updated": 1472596108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458861", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25258095": {"recommendationid": "25258095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017737910", "num_games_owned": 337, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507319485}, "language": "english", "review": "Only one more level...\nOh it's 4 AM", "timestamp_created": 1472595388, "timestamp_updated": 1472595388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559447", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25256939": {"recommendationid": "25256939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150616294", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475116960}, "language": "english", "review": "When I was young, (younger, anyway), I found n on a site and loved it.

I enjoyed making maps, jumping around, and having my hopes and dreams crused by 88-4 in N 1.4.\n\nN++ is a game I would unreservedly recommend for anyone who was a fan of the original N, or for someone who enjoys physics-based platformers and challenge. It stays very true to the original N while adding some new mechanics that give a fresh new twist to the game (current favorite mechanic: toggle mines).\n\nIts performance is a huge improvement over the original N in ways that actually matter. Corner jumps can be done very reliably now for those with the skill to do them, and laser drones in pits will fire at you the exact moment you come into sight.\n\nHave I mentioned that I really like the levels? The intro section is a fantastic overview of the basics, which means the main game is free to get right into the meat of the gameplay without too much faffing about. All the levels in the N++ section are new, where the legacy episodes are derived from old levels that have been cleaned up and tweaked for N++.\n\nI do have a few minor gripes, however. Make no mistake, though, these are minor.\n\n* Sometimes, N++ feels a little TOO faithful to the original N. Death by falling from too high on a bounceblock is still a thing, as is the strange frictional interaction on the top surfaces of horizontally-moving thwumps. I can only assume these are still here for historical reasons, since it otherwise makes no sense (though I have hunches as to why they are the way they are within the code).\n* I know that collecting all the gold is an optional objective, but some levels make collecting all the gold a time consuming but not altogether challenging process, with individual flecks widely spaced out but numerous.\n* The death replay in the main menu includes suicides, which ends up showing a lot of replays where I suicided due to not being happy with my time or getting one piece of gold that I would still have an opportunity to get later. Preferably, the death replays would only show suicides when the topology of the map changed such that the exit became permanently inaccessible, but that gets a touch complicated.\n* N++'s tiles don't seem to include several \"micro\" tiles that I believe were present in N+ XBLA. I would have loved to see those make a comeback and for there to be more of them.\n* I haven't found a built-in way to import old N levels into N++. That would have been nice.\n* There are some audio and UI bugs, but I'll leave those out of this review.

And then I ran into the web version of N v1.4, which became the game I have most likely played more than any other. Playing N++ is reliving the nostalgia but it's also something else: Realizing, with the games I've played in between, how well made N and it's sequels are. \n\nStyilsh, fast, and easy to pick up, this game does everything that a platformer does. It doesn't mess around with masterful art, choosing instead to stay minimal and sleek, and having the focus be on the things that move and don't move. \n\nThe main thing I'd consider about this game compared to its predecessor is: is what it offers better than what the free version offers? Yes, undoubtedly. Old level styles are spiced up with new enemies, gimmicks, and a reinvigorated sense of tension. One of my favorite additions are what I like to call the clone drones, which follow you around exactly and kill you when you touch them. One is reminded of Super Mario Galaxy's shadow mario and that is a perfect place to draw inspiration from.\n\nThere are a few things I think they could add in to make it a bit better, however.\n1. The headband! This was a great feature of N+ Xbox 360 edition and it felt pretty great to jump around with the red headband trailing behind you.\n2. Speaking of N+, both the DS and the Xbox versions had some kicking music. Adding them in as bonuses (which they might be, i have no idea) would be amazing. \"The Way of the Ninja\" and \"Crackalak\" especially.\n\nSo yeah, this game is defintely what I'm going to spend my next month playing.

The franchise is highly popular among the handheld console and console audience. The first game in the N series, simply called N (or The Way of the Ninja) debuted as a freeware video game back in 2005 on PC, Mac and Linux. The series then found its way onto Xbox Live Arcade in 2008 followed by PSP and Nintendo DS in August of the same year. Both titles were massive hits with platforming fans. Therefore, I found it surprising that N+ was never brought to Steam and that it took seven years to create a sequel. Thankfully, N++ was finally developed and released onto PlayStation 4 in July (2015) and has now been brought to Steam.\n\n[h1]Positively Floaty[/h1]\n\nIf you enjoy games where movement is floaty then this is the game for you. It is because of the floatiness of the movement that efforts to increase your precision-based skills are a little more difficult. However, I urge you not to be discouraged because the game is not intended to be easy. The developers have given players 1.5 minutes (90 seconds) to complete each episode. This can prove to be a very vigorous test of your skill.\n\nI couldn't possibly imagine an N game where the character is stiff. This is because the floatiness provides much of the game's essence and fun factor. Therefore, unlike in many other games where floatiness can be deemed to be negative, it is a positive here. The floatiness allows players to pull off many maneuvers that would be impossible otherwise. It simply takes time to get used to the differences if you have played other games.\n\n[h1]Competitive[/h1]\n\nA feature of the game that I do not believe is drawing nearly enough attention to it is the competitive aspect. The game incorporates leaderboard systems that push you to better yourself every time you play. This adds an incredible amount of replayability to the game. You may find yourself wanting to learn by repeating the same levels and becoming incrementally better. The first time that I played the opening series of levels I found myself in the high thousands. When I repeated the levels again I found that I had jumped several thousand positions on the ladder. The feeling of reward that I gained from doing this made it worth it. Therefore, the competitiveness is both against the community level as well against yourself.\n\n[h1]2360 Levels[/h1]\n\nWith such a significant amount of replayability you may suspect that the game lacks content. Put your mind at rest. There is more content featured within this game than any other platformer I have ever played. The game comes packed with 2360 hand-made levels. Furthermore, the game contains a level editor, custom levels, and global level sharing.\n\nAlthough I have not played the mode myself I feel that a review would be incomplete without the mention of local co-op and competitive mode. There simply are not many platformers of this nature that have these features built into them. I can imagine that this feature alone making the game that much more appealing. Unfortunately, those that would like to see online multiplayer would be disappointed. However, because of the precision timing required to play the game it is perfectly understandable as to why this feature is an impossibility.\n\n[h1]Is it Steamified?[/h1]\n\nThe game comes with 26 Steam achievements and a set of trading cards.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nN++ may well prove to be the only platformer that you will ever need. It is literally the crack version of a platformer. The game is super addictive, plays extremely well and keeps offering you new and challenging content. This is one of the easiest recommendations that I will offer this or in any other year. My only criticism is that it took this long to get the game onto Steam.\n\nFor similar reviews and your chance to win great giveaways visit [url=http://www.steamified.com/]Steamified[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1472580027, "timestamp_updated": 1472621882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632378", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25251002": {"recommendationid": "25251002", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996459869", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490711918}, "language": "english", "review": "Brings back memories of N+ on the Xbox 360!

I just briefly mentioned the lack of online mutiplayer because people who liked the online multiplayer in N+ are obviously gonna wanna know that this game doesn't have it before they buy it. I actually barely care at all because I almost never played multiplayer. This disclaimer is here because whiny brats just read \"No multiplayer\", skipped the rest of the review, downvoted me 62 times for stating an objective fact, & whined in the comments.\n\nNo online multiplayer & the alleged reason sounds like complete nonsense. I have to wear headphones to have sound but the volume settings barely work until I lower them to 1, at which point, the game becomes almost inaudible.\n\nMost of the game is offscreen no matter what settings I use even though I don't have that problem with other games. This caused me to die in the intro level & I got an achievement for it called You Suck But That's Ok which is kind of like just lighting my money on fire, shitting on it, & throwing it at the screen. Good thing refunds exist.\n\nThis kind of thing isn't surprising considering the trailer is pointlessly painful to the eyes &, instead of fixing it, someone just put a seizure warning at the beginning of the trailer.\n\nEdit: Proof that this game has no excuse: The fact that the only way people can think of to argue with me is by obsessing over my acknowledgement of the lack of multiplayer, ignoring the rest of the review, & ignoring the fact that I said I don't personally care much about the multiplayer. You can't review a sequel to a multiplayer game without acknowledging the lack of multiplayer. Even if I gave the game a 10/10, I'd still have to acknowledge that problem because people who primarily played N+ in co-cop are obviously gonna wanna know that this game won't let 'em do that (except locally).

The controls feel smooth and heavy, and platforming is less dependent on twitchy reflexes and more planning your jumps appropriately to conserve momentum. The levels (2500+ official levels!) are varied and well designed - from open arenas based on dodging rockets to linear pathways filled with mines, each level is designed to challenge but always fair. The game runs at a smooth 60fps, and although an option to increase the fps cap would be nice, it is perfectly playable at 60. The soundtrack is perfectly fits the minimalist style and is over six hours of music. \n\nNot to mention the user generated maps, the local co-op (or competition), and plans for online multiplayer in the future.

Its nice that they have multiplayer, but I was really hoping to get to play online. I was pretty disappointed when I found this out, and for most people this is situation specific. If you still play multiplayer locally then no worries!\n\nCharacter color. We can't figure out how to change our character's colors like we could in N+. I googled it and found some forums saying that you can't, although I'm not ruling it out, maybe it does exist. However if it doesn't I'm sad about that too. I liked the colors and their corresponding names. I was always Cherry bomb, and we still yell \"BANANA\" when my little brother dies in any game.\n\nSo, those two things are pretty miniscule, and specific to my personal taste.\n\nPro's. >>\n\nYou can color swap the whole game. They have themes that don't just change the look of menus, but the whole game itself. This is pretty rad. \n\nRacing. Multiplayer has coop like in N+ but they added in racing and this was the most fun we have had so far with it.\n\nAssasins. The lazers and missles you remember are back for another go. But, they are small fry compared to the new enemy assasins that spawn and kick yo ass!\n\nSo many levels. With the level creator and being able to share online there are more levels than you can ever hope to play. Now personally I have attempted to play additional levels in games like trackmania, and the majority are garbage, so this may have some gems but I bet it will take some digging. This is speculation though I have not really adventured outside of the base game levels yet.\n\nConclusion >>\nI loved N+. And I think what is bugging me has to do with the multiplayer.

Finally completing the level was more satisfying that with any other platformer.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth. Only three keys. Minimalistic design, without distractions. Cool music. Awesome colors. Plenty of levels. N++ hits all the right buttons. Your main challenge isn't to go fast: it's to finish the level, and get all the gold. Speed is secondary to timing. That's why N (now plus plus!) is my absolute favorite platformer.\n\nAlso you can crash into a wall, or the ground, if you go too fast.

Guide your character, the ninja, avoiding various traps, obstactles, and fall damage in search of riches. (gold coins scattered throughout levels).  The ninja can wall jump and move in any direction.  Every level has at least one door switch that opens a door to the end of the level.  Navigate to that open door to finish a level.  There are between 2000 and 2500 total official levels in three modes called Co-op, race, and solo mode ranging from easy/tutorial scaling up to the extremely challenging.  All of these modes consist of episodes that have a pack of 5 levels together.  As time passes in a level the score counts down.  When that score hits 0 the ninja explodes and must start the level over.  The time is additive in every episode.  Collecting gold adds time.  After beating an episode, it is possible to select levels individually.  There are global leaderboards for every individual level and episode as well as friend leaderboards and replays for every best personal score.  There is an in-game editor where players can make and play community made levels.    \n\nPros:\n-Fantastic control of character.  Seemingly limitless possibilities with different routes and strategies.\n-Enough game content to play for well over 100 hours.\n-Game content is all extremely high quality.  This game just keeps giving unexpectedly, even more than advertised.  The developers were perfectionists with this game arguably to a fault from a game developer's perspective.  A fantastic opportunity for the consumer.  It is obviously a game made out of love over a long period of time.\n-Devs plan to add even more content (more levels and game modes) and always intently listen to their player base. \n-Soundtrack is 3+ hours of high quality music.\n-Players have full access to a level editor where we can make and play user levels that also have leaderboards.\n-Game scales in difficulty appropriately so that it is newbie friendly and then turns into an expert challenge.\n\nCons:\n-No online multiplayer.  Only local multiplayer.\n-Currently the player can die and restart any level on episode mode without penalty so that the episode leaderboards are like playing any individual level anyway, yet they do not record on the individual level leaderboard while playing in episode mode.  This makes the individual level concept/leaderboard quite redundent.\n-On episode mode it is possible for a level to be impossible if the time is low enough entering the next level.  If this happens the player is forced to start the episode over and the game gives no warning when this happens.\n-The story of the game is fairly bland.\n-In the editor players can make impossible levels.\n\nOpinion:\n      N++ is a masterpiece, brilliant platformer.  The price of the game is dirt cheap for all the content in it.  If you are at all interested in platformers this is a must buy.  The game is focused on the platforming gameplay, not on the story so that doesn't matter much.  It is an absurd amount of content as it is yet more is planned to be added.  The flaws with individual level and episodes are minuscule and you have to go out of your way to discover these minor nitpicks.  They could not afford online Co-op.  If the game sells enough they will implement it.  The impossible levels in the editor are a definite nuisance but fortunately there are ways to sort levels by best or featured so this isn't obtrusive. \n\nBottom line:\n      N++ is brilliant and every bit as good as advertised.  If you don't enjoy this game it is because you don't like the platforming genre.

N++ takes your typical platformer and focuses on what is most important, running and jumping. All you do in the game is run and jump avoiding obstacles to open the door and escape the level. This might sound simplistic but N++ works because the gameplay is so satisfying. The controls work really well and I love how the game feels as you need to use momentum while moving and jumping. If you like platformers I don't know why you wouldn't enjoy N++'s gameplay.\n\nN++ also shines in the amount of content you get. The game has thousands of levels and even though they are only around 10-20 seconds long you can expect to get at least 10 hours out of the game. N++ also includes a level editor so the game could end up being close to endless if players develop good levels for the game. \n\nBasically I only have two small complaints about N++. First not all of the levels are created equally. A lot of the levels are really good but there are your occasional levels that are kind of bland. When you have thousands of levels that is to be expected though. Second while I really enjoyed N++ I don't see it as a game to play for hours at a time. I see it more as the type of game that you play for 30 minutes to an hour each day and then come back to another day.\n\nN++ is a very good platformer.

This means that your lifespan must not reach 0 before you compelete all 5 rooms. Dodging all the enemies in the room is a must because you're so fast you will die in 1 hit from all enemies.\n\nThe controls are tight, and if mastered can provide an awesome feeling of accomplisment as you effortlessly glide through episode after episode. You unlock colour schemes the more episodes you compelete giving the game an awesome new look.\n\nComplete with a level editor N++ is an awesome comeback to PC for the N franchise which I've sorely missed. Bringing it back home has earned it a solid 8/10 and for this price its worth picking up asap!", "timestamp_created": 1472206007, "timestamp_updated": 1472206007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25158662": {"recommendationid": "25158662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157229490", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482492906}, "language": "english", "review": "You thought you escaped your abusive father Super Meat boy ?

It was a flash game that you could play directly from Metanet Softare's website (the developers) for free. It was amazing. It created memories.\nI was extremely discouraged to hear that N++ would start by releasing for consoles. No hate for consoles, but it's just that I didn't have either the XBox or the PS. The only thing I could see was the tease on Youtube videos.\n\nNow, you can finally enjoy the full beauty that is N, The Way of The Ninja. It plays just as I remembered, only better. The physics is just aas I remembered, only better. The style is just as I remembered, only better.

You kind of just have to try it to fully understand.  Thankfully, the original free flash game is still available to play online after all these years.

More levels, more obstacles and \"enemies\", more modes including co-op and racing (but not online, which has upset some people)..  If you like a game that is challenging but fair, you'll probably enjoy it.  The controls are tight, and the physics of the movement of the character is a fun aspect of the game to get a 'feel' for.  You will actually feel yourself getting better at the game the more you play.\n\nKeyboard controls have always worked fine for the original N, but of course this version supports controller, and I have grown quite fond of playing this way already.\n\nAll in all, this is a fine quality PC game.

After getting many of my friends hooked on it, we played it on and off in some form for years, throughout college and the rest of our lives.

N is the source for most of what made Meat Boy interesting, thematically and mechanically.\nDo you hate Super Meat Boy? N is far more easily controlled, designed with a keyboard in mind, and has significantly shorter and more feature-dense levels without all of the bugs and clipping issues of SMB.\n\n[b]Do you like ninjas[/b]?

You also have to complete an entire episode withnin an extendable time limit.\n\nGraphics- 9/10\nN goes for a very appealing minimalist style. It uses solid colors, bold lines, and simple shapes, which is very appealing. You can also change the color palette. Although, some colors the palettes use are very bright. So bright, it feels like they're burning you're retinas.\n\nControls- 7/10\nThe controls feel very floaty. The Ninja Man has long hang time, and he slides a little bit before he comes to a stop. This means a lot of deaths because you either overshot a jump, or hit some hazrd because The Ninja Man just didn't want to stop.\n\nSound- 9.5/10\nThe soundtrack in this game is pretty good. All of the music selections go for a techno-pop type of feel. It sort of reminds me of the music they would play during the Adult Swim bumpers. The ambient noises are nice to listen to, also. From the beeps and bloops of the murderous robots, to the pitter-patter of The Ninja man's feet when running, to the snapping of all his bones from a long fall, most of the sounds aren't too grading on the ear.  But one sound that definitely IS grading the sound of picking gold up. That sound gets pretty annoying, expecially if you pick up multiple pieces in rapd succession. But that's more of a nitpick.\n\nGameplay Value- 11/10\nThe gameplay value of this game is fantastic. I did the math. You get 225 episodes, and each episode has 5 levels each. That's 1,125 levels to play. You also have achivements you can get, and user made levels. That's insanely good value.\n\nStory- N/A\nThere is none. Well, there is, but it's only a wall of text. The story takes a backseat to the gameplay, so I didn't even bother\n\nOverall- 9.5/10\nN++ is an insanely fun, simple, difficult, and addicting game. Sure the controls are floaty, but the all positives greatly outwiegh that one negative. And you get an extremely good deal. For 15 dollars, you get 26 achivements, and litteraly over thousands of levels to play. If you love the platformer genre, N++ is one game you don't want to pass up.\n\n(p.s If 15 dollars is too much for you, or you're still not too sure, you can always try the free flash version, \"N\", online. You don't get as many base levels, but you still get a level editor, and user made levels.)", "timestamp_created": 1472182968, "timestamp_updated": 1472788756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25154657": {"recommendationid": "25154657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182247989", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509725087}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes", "timestamp_created": 1472182366, "timestamp_updated": 1499577497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25154546": {"recommendationid": "25154546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029937118", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485122042}, "language": "english", "review": "Played the S*** out of N+ on the xbox market.

The only thing it is missing is Online Multiplayer.\n\nIn a little more depth, if you've never played a game in the series:\n\nIn my opinion, the greatest aspect of this game is the challenge. In essense, it isn't too challenging once you get the basics down. You move around expertly designed levels, momentum is key, and certain things kill you. You have 90 seconds to complete an episode of 5 levels, and the gold coins scattered around the levels give you 2 extra seconds each.\n\nThe majority of the episodes are not too challenging to complete in 90 seconds; What makes it difficult are the tight controls; You clip corners quite often here; One wrong move, and you're dead, falling, losing momentum, etc... Combine that, and a subtle play on your desire to be better; faster; and you have one of the greatest platforming games of all time. As is the standard for this series,; There is also a level creator and sharing capabilities.\n\nI've waited since the Original for there to be a Sequel on PC (Mostly, one with controller support) and now that it is here, i'm far from dissapointed. Sure, the lack of Online, Real time Multiplayer (Survivals, Races, Co-Op) is a little saddening, but i do personally enjoy the Solo aspect far too much to not buy this game, regardless.\n\nI would easily say this is one of the best games you can buy for under $15.", "timestamp_created": 1472173739, "timestamp_updated": 1472173739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25153148": {"recommendationid": "25153148", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980676884", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504810897}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing N in one form or another since I was a kid, it seems only fair the devs get some of my money now. \n\nThis isn't at all a departure from the series, this is N Classic with more polish, new elements, new maps, a map editor, better music, and same-system co-op. \n\nSame controls, same atmosphere, and same butt-clenching stress as before. Sound good? Great.\n\nIf you're new to the series, the older games are available online still, check em out.\n\nDon't let anybody tell you this is like Super Meat Boy. The controls are similar, but Super Meat Boy manufactures difficulty by forcing you to move through the map at high speeds, and swinging obstacles into the field of view quickly - so you essentially have to memorize the map by dying a certain number of times. Or maybe your reaction time is way better than mine, who am I to judge (Synth)\n\nHere, you see the entire map at once, and once you have the hang of enemy movement patterns, you can plan your route before the timer even starts, and it's not uncommon to finish a map in one gloriously satisfying, white-knuckle first try, barely squeezing through gaps in mines and racing past homing missiles.\n\nIt's...

And as a completionist that bugs me to no end.\n- players can make levels, that might sound like a pro, but it's mostly a con to me. The game has only been out a few hours and I already found a golden swastika.\n- no built-in levels for racing, thus the racing is just a pile of uninspired player created content that is either bad, or way to hard.\n- the \"you suck\" stage. In the race mode after you take to long or press a button the game will enter the you suck stage. In that stage it will slowly make the level easier to get someone to win the race. That's all fine and dandy, but when I'm getting ticked of because a level is to hard don't go tell me I suck.

If it follows the other games in the series, great custom levels should pop up as more people get the game.", "timestamp_created": 1472145149, "timestamp_updated": 1472145149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25135975": {"recommendationid": "25135975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014610676", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 2089, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508283577}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si disfrutaste de Super Meat Boy este juego es ideal para vos...", "timestamp_created": 1472145133, "timestamp_updated": 1472145133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538227", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25135895": {"recommendationid": "25135895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021310711", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509872800}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been waiting for this sequel for over 10 years, and it's everything I could have hoped for. N++ is a brilliant, unique style of platformer that has sometimes rage-inducing, sometimes epic moments. The game is easy to learn, has [i] very [/i] simple and satisfying controls, (left and right movement keys and a jump button which you can hold down for a lengthier leap) but is still challenging as a proper platformer should be. The basic premise of the game is to complete levels, by going through doors while collecting gold to increase your points. There are 5 levels in one group and completing them will unlock you the next set of levels. Pretty simple, right?\n\n In later stages you will have to manipulate the map perfectly to get that slight boost in your jump, weave through tight areas to evade a missile on your tail, or use a ramp to break an otherwise fatal fall. The gold littered around each level is a neat feature which adds a bit of a gamble into the game. Do you go the route brimming with gold, but also traps, or do you take the easier route and try and finish as quickly and surely as possible...\n\n  Multiplayer and interaction with the rest of the community is now bigger. There is a leaderboard which competitive players will like, and adds to the reward of finishing a level perfectly. If you have a friend along for the ride, you can either play with, or against each other. Co-op will have you working together, sometimes sacrificing yourself so that your buddy can finish the level. The Race mode on the other hand adds a tense competition between who can finish the level with the most points, and will have you shouting as you near the door to your victory.\n\n Sometimes you will ragequit a level and come back to it later to finish it with that sweet taste of revenge. Veteran players will recognise some of the classic hazards, redefined, and a whole load of new threats are also introduced, like ghosts of yourself running around, detonating you into a million pieces if they touch you. Laser turrets, mines, drones, and electric blocks are just some of the other obstacles you will face.\n\n The levels are now brightly colored and you can change the music and color palette to your liking. It's a nice change to the constant gray of the previous games. The animations and textures of everything are also more pleasant and sharp. The new level editor has improved by miles. It's more intuitive, much easier to use and enables better made community levels, which there are tons of. \n I highly recommend N++ if you liked the older versions and ESPECIALLY if you've never played an N game.\n4.5/5\n\n[b]EDIT[/b]: The devs just added a big update with 95 new levels and a new, harder game mode, Ultimate, after the game is released.

It may have been as exactly that, just N, the flash version of the platformer you got good at for bragging rights, or the 360 version, that didn't change a whole lot but did have more of N. It stands to reason that the latest version, N++, is exactly that: it's still very much N, but with more of everything. You'll still have to dash around levels collecting gold - you're a greedy ninja who can't resist its allure - and avoiding enemies and hazards, but instead of ten or a hundred levels, there's thousands of 'em.\n\nThe tools given to you are simple enough, with running and jumping being the only things your ninja can do, but as the suggestive name levels will tell you - they range between outright mocking your capacity to cluing you in as to what you have to do - it's how you interact that matters. N++ is a momentum-based platformer, and learning when to jump from a slope, how far you can fall before you go splat and how far up you need to leap is key to success. While at first things may seem simple enough, in the first row of levels you'll already be confronted with the fact that you're bad at this game, as a particular level has golden pieces just out of reach, with only a few slopes near them, and knowing how to maximize your leaps by using these slopes is still something you haven't learned.\n\nWhile it might initially seem similar to other platformers, such as Super Meat Boy, N++ takes an entirely different approach to its design: finishing the levels themselves isn't that difficult, what is hard is mastering the game to the point you can complete them in a quick fashion or while gathering all the gold nuggets. This reflects in the mood of the game, as while death can be frustrating in other platformers, in N++ it's similar to the loss of a pole vaulter who sets his bar a tad higher than he can and knocks it down because of it: you could have completed the level if you hadn't tried to get all the pieces of gold, or if you hadn't tried to get a specific time. There's still difficulty in N++, it just seems to be an option rather than a roadblock.\n\nFor those who had grown used to, and perhaps tired of, the greyscale background of the original games, N++ has an offering of different filters for you to change its looks. While I enjoyed some of them and loathed others, at time with colors too bright, I found myself going back to the easy-on-the-eyes standard filter due to how unobtrusive it was. This is also true of the soundtrack, which went from a more pulsing beat to the amalgamation of trip-hop and trance present in this version, whose soothing tones likely played a role in my lack of frustration upon death.\n\nN++ is a distilled platformer, simple and lightweight, something that some might equate to lacking, some to clever design. For those with a competitive vein, N++ has leaderboards and score tracking, as well as a co-op mode and competitive racing, but it was in taking my own time with the single-player levels that I found the most fun. I didn't find motive to play it for long stretches of time, but N++ makes for a good game to visit every day for a couple of stages, chipping away at the massive roster of intelligently designed levels.", "timestamp_created": 1472144526, "timestamp_updated": 1472146408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521403", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25135786": {"recommendationid": "25135786", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985971835", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514477836}, "language": "english", "review": "WARNING: Mad skills required.", "timestamp_created": 1472144506, "timestamp_updated": 1472144506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464057", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25135611": {"recommendationid": "25135611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034297875", "num_games_owned": 5022, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472179789}, "language": "english", "review": "N++ is a 2d platform game in which the player guides a stick ninja to a switch, and then to a door. Along the way, gamers can choose whether to collect coins that will extend the level\u2019s timer or not, and have to dodge various obstacles that can kill the stick ninja in one hit.\n\nThe game\u2019s controls seem as simple as N++\u2018s premise, though level after level, the game\u2019s designers go out of their way to make the player think about more advanced movement techniques in order to advance. Gamers start N++ thinking that it\u2019s a game about pressing a button and jumping, but they quickly discover that jumps depend on acceleration and positioning, turning a task that wouldn\u2019t normally require much thought into something far more interesting.\n\nCoin collection is something that most platformers feature, and it\u2019s another classic trope that N++ quickly turns into something else, as players discover that grabbing all the coins in a level isn\u2019t always a good idea, and that greed can turn an otherwise incredibly easy level into a nigthtmarish adventure.\n\nLater levels introduce enemies that can move and even shoot homing projectiles at the player, upping the stakes, as many of those new hazards can be bypassed if gamers don\u2019t go after the tantalizing gold coins.\n\nIf players ever get tired of the game\u2019s 2,360 solo levels (yes, that\u2019s not a typo, the game actually features more than two THOUSAND hand made levels) there is a race mode and a local cooperative experience (which requires real cooperation, as one of the players may need to die in order for the other to progress in some cases, among other interesting cooperative interactions)\n\nHopefully the developer will be able to add an online mode in the future, though it will all depend on the game\u2019s success.\n\nGamers interested in creating their own levels can also engage in that activity, as the game features a robust level editor which also lets players upload their creations so others may play them.\n\nVisually, N++ is a minimalist experience, which is something that works on its favor at all times, letting gamers see hazards clearly.\n\nThe game\u2019s audio design is also quite clean, and the soundtrack features a selection of techno music tracks that fit N++\u2018s minimalist visuals perfectly.\n\nN++ is a challenging platformer that every fan of the genre should play. Few games can be so rewarding for those who take the time to understand their mechanics, and even fewer can claim to be as focused and pure as Metanet Software\u2018s masterpiece is.\n\n \n\n9.5/10 \u2013 Excellent\n\nFor more game reviews, don't forget to check out www.gamingonpc.com\n\nNote: Playtime is not representative of my experience with the game, as I actually played most of it on PS4.

If you enjoyed those previous games, you will feel right at home with this installment in the series. The game feels almost identical, with the exception of new aesthetics, enemies, music etc.\n\n[h1]------------------------------------------------ [/h1]\n[h1]How N++ Plays[/h1]\n[h1]------------------------------------------------ [/h1]\n\nIf you've played previous games in the series, feel free to skip this section where I just explain how the game works. Read from \"What's New?\"\n\nI think this game is a great example of \"Simple to pick up, hard to master\". It might look like any old platformer, but once you really start to get a feel for the mechanics of the game, you learn all sorts of techniques that are necessary to beat later levels. \n\nUsing momentum is something very important in this game, which is what makes playing it feel so good. Depending on your speed, what walls you hit and the angle you jump at, you can go flying through the stage. You also need to be careful with your descents. If you hit the floor from too high up, you will die, unless you can slow yourself down by sliding down a wall or landing on a ramp. \nDue to all this stuff, you never feel cheated out of a death. If you die, it's your fault.\n\nAlthough the game can get hard at times, I never felt that it was unfair. The difficulty curve is really good!\n\nYou play the game in chapters. Each chapter has a few levels you need to complete under a shared timer. It's quite a generous amount of time, so don't feel stressed. While you progress through levels, you collect little golden blocks that increase your timer and score. You don't need to collect them all, since they can sometimes be very tricky, but if you enjoy seeing yourself on the leaderboard, it's an option.\n\n\n[h1]------------------------------------------------ [/h1]\n[h1]What's New?[/h1]\n[h1]------------------------------------------------ [/h1]\n\n\nIn N++, you get a few new things to the series. You can change the colour palette of the game. For the most part, I think a lot of these are too eye-straining to enjoy, although they are pretty, I'd rather stick to some of the darker ones. It's nice that you can unlock these as you play though.\n\nI LOVE the soundtrack. The game hosts music from many different artists, all of them quite chill electronic music. Although the game is difficult, it can also be very relaxing with this soundtrack.\n\nThere are a few new obstacles and enemy types to the series that mix things up a bit.\n\nObviously you also get tonnes of new levels, which will keep you playing for a very long time. \n\nThe game also comes with a level creator, as the series has had before. It's relatively easy to use, and will allow the community to keep the game alive through making some pretty fun and creative levels to play.\n\nThe game still has Solo, Co-op and Race modes which allow for some fun times. Co-op relies a lot on teamwork, and sometimes you will need to sacrifice yourself so your teammate can complete the level.\n\nRace is a competitive game mode where you get to race against your friends (or by yourself). Pretty self-explanatory.\n\nAll modes are playable with 1-4 players, although if you play solo level with multiple people, you forfeit your spot on the leaderboard. Still, it's a nice option to have!\n\n\nOverall, I strongly recommend this game to any platformer fan. The movement feels so good, and it's just super satisfying to land perfect jumps while listening to the great soundtrack. The only downside I can really think of is that there's no online co-op, which I'm hoping will change in the future. While I agree that it's more fun to have my friend on the couch next to me, it isn't always an option. Other than that, great game.

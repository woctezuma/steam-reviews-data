Most puzzle games that I enjoy require some kind of insight to proceed, or at least, are designed such that strategic thinking is superior to trial and error. You apply logic, derive a pattern and act on it.\n\nThis game on the other hand does not reward thinking much. The best strategy seems to be: Find pieces that fit the border (usually this will yield a unique partial solution) and go from there (usually there is a unique way to do so). This took me through the hundred levels in roughly six hours with little cause to reconsider my strategy. It's not super boring (you can listen to music or podcasts in the background) but does not provide an interesting challenge either.\n\nI would have hoped for more clever puzzles. There are topological and graph theoretic insights that levels could be built upon, such as:\n\n\u2022 Any cut through the level crosses an even number of lines (of each colour).\n\u2022 The curvature of each loop must sum up to a multiple of 360\u00b0.\n\u2022 If there are crossings between red and blue lines, then this number of crossings must be even.\n\u2022 The number of times line segments connect to the left end of a hexagon equals the number of times that a connects to the right (for each colour. the same for the other two directions).\n\nI think it would have been possible to build new mechanics and levels around those mechanics that encourage and reward thinking about these things. Sadly, the existing levels are designed such that considerations of this kind are either useless or more tedious than just applying trial and error.\n\nThere are puzzle games out there that convey interesting logical insights and reward the application of them, making the player feel smart when solving a challenge.

A nice puzzle game that can be played either as brain workout and try to figure out where pieces go to form the final shape with logic and visualization or played by just moving things around until you get a flash of inspiration and complete the level. I prefer to just move things around but some times it's nice to try and see if you can figure what the shape is with all the pieces scattered around.\n\nI backed this game on kickstarter so I got a couple more hours of play and I'm still not even close to level 100.\n\nDefinetly worth the price if you are into puzzle games. As was said, maybe just lower the volume a bit and it can be pretty relaxing.

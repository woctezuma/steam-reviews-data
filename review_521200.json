Minigames can be fun but sometimes stressful.\n\nThe combat itself can be very complex at first due to having so many options and all 3 characters at the start.. but you will get used to it fairly soon.\n\nThe game's bonus content is suprisingly large, with alot of cool concept art and even FAN art, also the AMAZING soundtrack. There's alot of medals to get, and if you have enough you can unlock hidden rooms with even more equipment.\n\nThis game normally can take around 10-20 hours to beat, depending how you play. There's 4 difficulty modes, Easy, Normal, Hard, and Epic.\n\nOnce you get into later battles, you really have to think and not just spam attacks hoping for the best. Elemental weaknesses are very important. \n\nThe Final Boss in my opinion is a huge step-up difficulty, with me getting my first game-over on it, I pray for those souls who play on Epic.\n\nOverall, this is a very fun and charming RPG game. While the story is quite generic and doesn't really have much of a plot, it's still a great RPG game to play. If you thought this game was good, you should try EBF4, and soon awaits an upcoming EBF5.\n\nThis game is free, and the soundtrack is too! I reccomend this game, it's a fun little series.\n\n8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1513292334, "timestamp_updated": 1513292334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38257975": {"recommendationid": "38257975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165823982", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511430935}, "language": "english", "review": "It was great to play one of my childhood games on steam, definitely a good game for those who dig turn based rpgs with good elements in it.

You only fight them when you talk to them. This means random encounters are less of a threat and more of an obstacle that you can overcome at your own pace.\n+ Bestiary and medals are tied to the game installation rather than a specific save. That means if you got a medal and then died before you could save, you'll still have it after reloading your save.\n+ Some features from later games got backported, like the wave counter.\n\nMixed:\n+- The dialogue is humorous, but the overall story is nothing groundbreaking. One of the players even admits this in the Volcano secret room.\n\nCons:\n- You can choose a character to learn a secret skill, but you can't unlearn it and give it to a different character. Fortunately, the consequences aren't too dire if you know how to use the characters properly.\n- Unlike the next game, scan is single target. This could be annoying for scanning bosses with multiple boss-specific allies, especially the final boss.\n- The quest log doesn't list the locations of previously met quest givers",

Both game series mean a hell of a lot to me so I'm kiiiinda biased....No I don't have two asses... Stop playing the impossible quiz for a second and listen.\n\nFirst off I'm going to talk about the music and then...eh screw it. I'll talk about a subject when I think about it.\n\nOk, so the music in this game, like the other 2 games before it and the 4th after it...ABSOLUTELY ROCKS! It's so awesome to listen to! The music suits the exact situation it is in, from towns to forests, battles to game over screens...It's just so amazingly awesome! I love the arranges as well but I still like how there was a bit of minimalist charm to them~\n\nOnto the characters.... For Matt, we have your usual brain of mush, button mashing, lovable idiot. He's so cool. Since the first EBF, he was always the embodiment of DPS...a big stupid jock with a sword bigger than him. I LOVE how we were able to swap his swords out for certain fights for that elemental edge! He was always pretty damned strong but as with all DPS...you spent ages healing the guy. In this one, He's a little more...Well he is certainly a bit smarter and much more \"I NEED this\" in terms of his personality, which is great! I love his character growth from DPS buffoon to DPS smart-a$$. His comments on things and his in battle text are always funny~\n\nFor Natz.... As everybody who is a fan of the series will say.... BOOBS!!!....Ahem...anyway.... Natz was your standard mage without any story or character and it only felt like she was just there so Mat doesn't die stupidly...but in EBF3...her character came to life and became the Natz we know...the chick who doesn't take crap...but gets it anyway. Before she used to always be in the back, making it like she was your average mage but in this and in EBF 4, she sits in the front lines with Matt showing that she has guts...and probably some balls as well...Good thing we can't poke those.... Usually the more level-headed member....\"usually\" \n\nFor Lance... From badguy dickhead to friend of awesomeness, this guy makes his debut in EBF2 but comes around in EBF 3 and 4. Your standard military gunner who is tactical, level headed and precise...usually. Yes I use that word a lot, get used to it... I love that he not only is a \"Synergist\" but also a backup healer! (For those who don't know, Synergist means he does status stuff) The effects on his weapons were always super helpful in battles and especially his gear... [spoiler] Officer uniform dropping airstrikes and tank shots between turns was a God send! [/spoiler] His character development in EBF 3 really helped people look at him differently than that one guy that was bullshit to beat in the previous title. \n\nFor the skill system... The skill system in this...TRUCKING GENIUS!!! Most games give each character a set of skills and that's that. No whining, no complaining...\"That's what it is so deal with it plebs\" but in this game... Not only did the characters have set skills which are obvious to their equipment...there were skills that all of them could learn and you had to decide WHO got them! In my opinion, this was a GREAT move! That means you can have one of the characters be able to do something they normally cannot, like Matt using magic for example. Sure...it doesn't hurt that much but still.... Giving him the [spoiler] Sonic Metal...whatever... skill [/spoiler] lets him heal the party and do damage! You can give it to Lance if you want but...yea... Anyway... You could hand debilitating skills to Natz to make sense or give them to Lance to keep the DPS rolling with Natz! It is such a good system and I just wish other games had it too when giving you multiple characters in an rpg.\n\nThe locations were pretty cool. I love the 3D graphics on a 2D plane with 3D uhh... implications? I don't wanna say it is 2.5D because it doesn't seem like that but then again...I'm no techie so it might be...who knows? It's like mystery meat, nobody knows what it is...cept the maker..s-shut up...\n\nThe items...nothing really to say here.\n\nThe weapons and clothing... Now...this was a fun idea! Getting random in battle events to happen when you upgraded them to a set level? So awesome! The different combos you could make were baffling! Well...not really but you know what I mean... You could go with a mainstream, failsafe outfit for all 3 that ups their stats and covers weaknesses...or you could mix it up focusing on the battle events to turn the battle in your favour despite being weak to them, you could overpower them with sheer skills. Though all of us have to admit... That Air Strike between rounds is the best thing in the game. Can't deny that one. \n\nThe bosses were all pretty difficult in their own right as you went through the game. There were no real super jumps in difficul-- oh yea... The Cosmic Monolith...Um yea... FUCK that guy... anyway... Other than the final boss, which can take anywhere between 10-45 minutes, the bosses and enemies in the game were perfectly staggered with the player levels and stats making it a wonderful transition that never left you feeling overpowered...unless you grinded...\n\nThat's all my brain is going to let me review so yea...hope you all liked it. Please be nice to me... I'm tired as I write this late review.

There are so many great tracks that appear in the game from world music to battle themes. Always enjoy bobbing my head to the song wings.\n\n     The art style is nice. The art is basic but since it is indie i can deal with that. It helps add to the comedy tone that the game sometimes has and helps provides a few chuckles when transitioning to a new area and they have a visual novel like scene that has some funny actions potrayed by the characters.\n\n      The combat looks nice. Can not say much about that but the magic attacks look pretty good and character animations/ enemy animations look cool.\n\nCon:\n       Frame rate sucks. When fighting multiple enemies mainly in the later stages doing attacks can drop the frame rate down alot from 30 or 60 to about 15 or 8. It is very annoying to be in combat and not be able to enjoy the visual flare that comes from using magic.\n\n        Level system is bad. The level cap is 30. That isnt bad but in an rpg like this leveling up is the means to balancing the game. If you cap it off and make the enemies the same level then where is the fairness? Depending on your success is up to RNG and that is not a good thing.\n\n        Enemies are awful. Not only do you have to deal with the level cap that will make any effort to balance things out impossible but enemies have chances to do some really annoying attacks. For an example some enemies can use death... yes that is an instant kill move that is RNG on whether you live or die and whats worse is its RNG...there is no way to effectively balance out these bullshit moments. Also there is a chance that regular enemies can drop an ice cicle on the player and it will kill them...fun. Also the ability to freeze enemies is very apparent in the ice level which is frustrating by itself.\n\n        Horrible ice level. Really nothing needs to be said about this besides being frozen sucks and believe me being frozen is one of those high chance moments and it is worse when the ice enemies constantly combo you into be frozen leading your unavoidable death. I went 3 turns without doing anything because i was constantly frozen so all i can say is if being frozen is a mechanic...make it a direct attack to a single player instead of a party.\n\n         The bosses are terrible. When fighting a boss they can also have a 1 hit kill move. In the case of the boss in the desert which is a 1 hit team kill move you must also fight additional enemies. It isnt fun to fight a hard boss and unlimited mob like enemies. It is not fun and provides much challenge. The dragon is the worst boss because he is the same level with many 1hit kill moves and all around a horrible boss.\n\n        Enemy weakness water? There is not a single water move in the game...did the devs even proof the game before release? I see that element on a few enemies and it is just odd that the enemies would be weak to an elemental attack that DOES NOT EXIST IN THE GAME.\n\nConclusion:\n         I played this game because it was free and i enjoy RPG games but nothing could ever prepare me for a cluster fuck of an experience that i had to do. I could talk about how bad the mini games are and how the controls for those mini games were garbage. Really in the end of the day the devs will not look at these criticims and maybe discredit all that has been stated in the review but the thing that makes me wonder the most is did they even play test the game? Really having insta death attacks is not fun in an rpg that can not be balanced with continuous grinding to balance out anything challenging. That process takes something that could be impossible and makes it more bearable and having the game deal with RNG as the main obstical is something that will quickly cause games to fail and gamers to get frustrated because the flow that the game should have is completely messed up with things that are unbalanced and unfair. I did once reccomend the game but seeing these issues and overall not enjoying the game because every battle i need to have some good luck item next to me else i would be one shot killed or frozen till death really opened my eyes to how bad this game is. Yes i played plenty of flash like rpg games....one of my favorite ones was Phrozen Flames 2 which i sinked many hours grinding to get stronger and balance out the challenging enemies/ bosses that i would encounter. So for anyone curious of this game...just avoid it and play any other rpg game. It is not worth the stress of gambling with RNG on whether you as the player would have a good time or not.", "timestamp_created": 1499448276, "timestamp_updated": 1499448276, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.342529", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33335975": {"recommendationid": "33335975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035675216", "num_games_owned": 1206, "num_reviews": 216, "playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499412132}, "language": "english", "review": "this game i find too much like Maple Story and i didn't enjoy that game.

I loved it then as I still enjoy it now. Warning: there is a very slight spoiler at the very beginning. But, it also tells you this very early in the game, so...\nPros\n+Story/Dialogue: Three idiots awaken an ancient diety, get their asses handed to them, and go on a quest for revenge. Oh, they also save the world. Guess that's a bonus. \"None of us are as stupid as all of us. Maybe it's the same with him.\" - Matt\n+Equipment: 80+ weapons and armor to choose from, each with their own abilities, stat bonuses, and elements. Upgrades to make said abilities better. Drop a mammoth on your enemies, or summon a narwhal from the earth. How? Upgrade your equipment, noobs.\n+Abilities: Many abilities to learn, 3 limit breaks per chararacter, and some abilities require you to have a different one, so on and so forth. Learn abilities such as (limit breaks): drop a tank on your enemies before you explode said tank, drop a collection of oversized swords, or give a cute smile and peace sign (buffs/heals party, debuffs all enemies).\n+NoLegs: he's a cat that has no legs (but two arms) that travels with the party and helps out. NoLegs is awesome. \n+Main Characters: Matt- the warrior who wants to kill/eat/steal everything. Natalie- the mage who cares for creatures (so long as they aren't slimy) and is somewhat the voice of reason. Lance- He has guns and he has a tank. Need I say more?\n\nNeutral\n*Minigames: A nice break from the main game, usually involving NoLegs, that can earn two acheivments per game and some gold. There's one minigame per area excluding the town.\n*Sidequests/Medals: Sidequests are basic trade this for that. Some items are exclusive to sidequests and have no other use. 3 Medals in total for sidequests. Medals unlock an extra map in each area (excluding town) filled with stronger enemies (compared to that area) and some treasures. Both can net you some nice equips.\n*Puzzles: See the image of Natalie commenting on how stupid they are. Then solve the pretty simple puzzles. Hint: the switches have those markings on them too.\n\nNegatives\n-Combat: Combat is always your three idiots move, then the enemies move and repeat. You can have your idiots move in a different order by selecting each one, but otherwise it is always Matt, then Natalie, then Lance. Enemies will always move from the one at the top of the screen to the one at the bottom.\n-Beasiary: This and medals are shared between saves. So once you scan every foe on one save, you never have to again (Scanning one foe uses Lance's turn once). This means that your first save is a chump for doing all of the work while all of the others never have to waste a turn scanning. You can also delete the beastiary and medals at any time though, but you have to actively go do that.\n\nFinal Score: 10/10\nThe humor and subtle references in the game make up for the two negatives I mentioned, and neither of those detract from the game enough anyway. The fact that this game is free online and on Steam means that unless you absolutely hate RPG's, some pervyness, and other humor, you should give this a try somewhere.", "timestamp_created": 1497448337, "timestamp_updated": 1497448760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32387134": {"recommendationid": "32387134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180530991", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507925040}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "\u00c9rdekes j\u00e1t\u00e9k.

I would like to say thank you for this game series. I was in a deep depression before I played the first EBF, and was getting pretty close to killing myself. I eventually found this game during 4th grade computer lab. After playing it through once, I showed it to my friends, and they got into the game too. We were hooked to the game after that, we wouldn't play anything else in that class except EBF. When EBF2 came out we played that for hours upon hours upon hours! Even when we were supposed to be asleep, we were talking over skype and having races on who could beat the game the fastest. This game did what no one could ever do, bring me out of my depression. My friends were so happy to see me not down in the dumps after almost three years. \n      Now onto EBF3, sorry if it took a while to get to this one. EBF3 is definitely an improvement over the first two, and is personally one of my favorite flash and rpg games out there (Even beating EBF4). The spells, combat, dialogue, characters, bosses, enemies, all of it is so perfect! A perfect blend of funny and epic moments. To be honest the only complaint that I would have is that it couldn't be better. Thank you Matt Rozak for this game, and I look forward for EBF5 and other future projects.

But I actually had finally completed it in 2013 and during my age of 14. Then I had even finally completed it again on Steam on absolutely December 31, 2016.\n\nThis game actually does make me feel nostalgic and especially the song \"Acruta Lao D'nor\" does more than this game.\n\nThank you Matt Roszak for making this game ever.

Get it? Only kids play in easy mode.\n\nI usually avoid getting the 'Pervert' achievement until I get all other achievements. That's because I'd find Natalie 'cute' and not 'hot' because I actually don't find any female characters 'hot' but I like female characters I find 'cute' such as that cute teenage magician girl named 'Natalie'.\n\nI even had seen/met Yoko Littner and Curly Brace as 2 NPCs being cameos/references in this game. Speaking of those 2 characters, I kinda like Curly Brace although she's not my primary favorite but I'm never looking at Yoko Littner's outfit in her actual franchse.\n\nDespite the cosmic monolith being that damn powerful, he's actually my most favorite enemy/monster in this game ever. He's still the strongest non-boss enemy/monster in this game though but he's one cool heck of a guy.\n\nAlso that tank boss (named \"Protector\") is actually my most favorite boss in this entire game ever and especially I listen to [url=http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/90532]this awesome classic music[/url] for fighting him.

AHORA!\n\n[h1] gameplay: [/h1] bueno, estamos frente a un jrpg clasico en todo su esplendor, el que no sepa de lo que hablo, tenemos batallas por turnos en donde podremos atacar una vez con cada uno de los 3 heroes que tenemos disponibles, cada uno con un set de armas y habilidades distintas para obtener distintos resultados, y esto juega un papel importantisimo, ya que todos los enemigos a los que nos enfrentaremos tendran sus debilidades, resistencias y ataques, asique tendremos que armar de la mejor manera posible a nuestros heroes antes de toda batalla (por ejemplo, si un enemigo es de fuego, la mejor estrategia es vestirnos con trajes resistentes al fuego y armas que potencien los ataques de agua/hielo) este detalle, hace al juego significativamente mas divertido\n\n[h1] soundtrack: [/h1] EBF 3 cuenta con una banda sonora bastante tipica en esta clase de juegos, musica con flautas y cosas asi para un bosque, canciones tipo hawai para la playa y obviamente, metal para los bosses, ya saben, cosas tipicas de un jrpg, sin embargo, esto esta hecho con un proposito, y esque este juego es una parodia a los jrpg, obviamente los cliches tienen que estar ahi, asi se hace mas facil burlarse de ellos, y la verdad esque los chistes que lanzan los personajes respecto a apartados del juego dan un aire mucho mas divertido al juego\n\n[h1] historia: [/h1] el juego toma lugar justo despues de EBF 2 (el juego esta gratis en internet, puedes jugarlo si asi lo deseas... o no...) luego de salvar al mundo de una guerra liderada por lance, este decide unirse al grupo de heroes, y juntos van a buscar aventuras, sin embargo, en una de sus incurciones encuentran un demonio encarcelado, se ve muy peligroso, mejoir dejarlo ahi... nah, eso seria muy aburrido, vamos a liberarlo!... resultado: todos los heroes vuelven al nivel 1 y pierden su equipo, y ahora que el demonio esta libre, nada le impide DESTRUIR EL MUNDO! asique nuestros heroes, como fueron unos retrasados, van en camino al demonio nuevamente a detenerlo y salvar al mundo una vez mas... no se ni porque me molesto en explicar la historia ya que el propio juego no le da importancia a la misma, se podria decir que esta de fondo, pero siempre es bonito saber porque haces las cosas no?... no?...\n\n[h1] personajes: [/h1] ya hablamos un poco de la historia, pero que hay de los personajes? primero tenemos al se\u00f1or todopoderoso matt, un imbecil de dudosa edad que adora las espadas, y tiene tendencias a hacerle bullying a su compa\u00f1era de batalla \"mejor te hubieras quedado en la cocina...\" matt, natalie, la maga blanca tetona, puede hacer todo tipo de hechizos, ya sea para curar, bufar o MATAR! aunque es animalista, cosa de la que los personajes tambien se suelen burlar \"no lo mates QwQ\" natalie, y el ultimo personaje es lance, el jefe final del juego anterior, personalmente me siento identificado con el ya que tiene una adiccion a las bebidas energeticas, usa armas a distancia y tuvo ligeros traumas en su ni\u00f1ez, traumas que son chistes recurrentes luego de algun golpe, \"mi padre me golpeaba mas fuerte que eso cuando era un bebe\" lance.\n\n[h1] duracion: [/h1] la rejugabilidad no es algo que se tenga muy presente al completar el juego, pero de aqui a pasarte el juego al 100% eso te tomara tiempo, hay armas que encontrar y mejorar, objetos que conseguir, recompenzas que reclamar, gente que ayudar, habilidades que desbloquear, objetos que consumir y hay mas, puede que no tenga mucho valor de rejugabilidad, pero te va a tomar tiempo pasartelo al 100%\n\n[h1] conclucion: [/h1] EBF 3 fue un juego que me causo muchos ataques de risa, tiene referencias por monton, es largo, los personajes son carismaticos y en cima es divertido, no he llegado mas alla del mundo 4 ya que los jrpg nunca se me dieron presisamente bien pero si eres un fan de final fantasy o cualquier juego de ese estilo, sabes ingles y te gusta el anime, pues hey, tengo un juego para ti\n\n[h1] puntuacion final: [/h1] le doy a epic battle fantasy 3 un 9.5/10 muy buen juego de combates por turnos y referencias sin fin, las historia no tiene mucho por si sola, me gustaria que hubieran puesto mas enfasis en ese apartado pero como ya dije, este detalle palidece ante lo que esel juego en general\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nsi te ha parecido que hice un buen trabajo con este analisis, agradeceria un pulgar arriba de tu parte, si crees que me he saltado un punto, o que no detalle algo importante, puedes hacermelo saber en los comentarios evitando insultos o actitudes toxicas\n\npor mi parte eso ha sido todo, nos vemos en el proximo analisis, NRG fuera\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1489955083, "timestamp_updated": 1489955083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511853", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30562326": {"recommendationid": "30562326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087565116", "num_games_owned": 352, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489720777}, "language": "english", "review": "I beat it (100% achievement) on epic in 25 hours of casual play.

The story & characters aren't meant to be deep but the game does have its humorous moments.  The combat and item systems are well done.  Music is pretty good as well.\n\nThe game is fairly simple in design.  You start in the only town with 3 characters to use.  You'll venture through 7 different environments battling enemies, leveling up, killing bosses, opening chests, & getting quests.  Each environment has a quick travel point right before the boss that allows you to instantly teleport back to the town.  The town has a couple shops where you can buy wearable equipment, forgeable items, and health/mp/status related items.  Each of your three characters has their own unique set of skills (fairly sizable) that you can upgrade as you choose throughout the game.  You'll have limited points to upgrade your skills at the start/mid points, so your choices will matter, but you will be able to unlock everything before you reach the end.  You'll also find a plethora of permanent stat upgrade items throughout the game that allow you to customize your characters further, you could keep your characters well balanced or buff certain characters to excel in certain stats.  Each character can equip a weapon, armor, and a hat.  The game has an autosave feature, but you can manually save the game at any time outside of battle.\n\nCombat is the game's main focus point and is where it really shines.  All enemies & bosses are viewable as you walk around, so you choose who you would like to fight.  Each environment has enemies on its \u201cmain path\u201d that you will have to fight in order to reach the boss; once you kill them they will never respawn.  Enemies off the \u201cmain path\u201d will respawn if you go back to town or to a different environment, so you can grind for extra XP or skill points should you need to (I played on the hard difficulty and never had to grind at all).  Enemies off the main path are often guarding chests or paths that lead to chests, so you're given incentive to fight them but don't have to if you don't want to. Combat is usually quick and simple.  Battle animations only last around 2 seconds or less for all attacks/spells (the exception being characters' limit breaks), so no sitting around for 10 seconds watching a character cast a damn spell.  Enemies start off simple but get stronger later on.  Enemies can be permanently scanned to see what elements and status effects they are weak/strong against.  Unlike a lot of RPGs, status effect spells and buff/debuff spells can be very useful in combat and are often essential against advanced enemies and bosses.  The mid and late game bosses are both difficult and rewarding to defeat.\n\nThe game has a unique equipment system that I don't recall seeing before.  All equipment starts off at level 1 and can be forged up to level 5.  All of a character's base stats are multiplied by 1.00 (So 30 base attack X 1.00 = 30 attack power).  When a character puts on a piece of equipment, instead of giving an increase to a stat (such as +30 attack), equipment gives an increase to a character's multiplier in various stats (such as + .15% to attack and + .10 to magic defense, so that 30 base attack is now multiplied by 1.15 = 35 attack power).  Instead of getting better and better equipment, you'll receive equipment that buffs/debuffs the multiplier for different stats, give different elemental/status resistances, and occasionally have a unique bonus that will unlock upon being upgraded to level 4 or 5 (such as automatically casting regen on your party or having a mammoth attack your enemies).  Even your starting equipment is viable at the end of the game, as no equipment is necessarily better or worse than any other equipment.  What equipment you want to equip will usually be based on what element enemies are currently weak to, what elements you should increase your resistance against, what stats you want buffed, or simply because you like the special bonus it provides.  Forging equipment is as simple as acquiring the necessary items, either by finding them in chests, receiving them from combat, or buying them at the shop.\n\nSome NPCs give quests, all of which are fetch quests.  You'll eventually find the items in chests or through battle.  The quest log lets you see what quests you have completed/outstanding and shows whether you have the necessary items to complete them.  Some of the rewards are pieces of equipment or permanent stat boosts, so running through and completing side quests once you get to the end of a zone can be helpful.  Completing quests are the only real backtracking you'll do in the game, but all NPCs are reachable once the main pathway is cleared, so you never have to fight enemies to get back to an NPC.\n\nNot much more to say.  Combat is solid, skill/equipment systems are diverse and interesting, occasionally funny (especially a couple of the achievements).  Would've enjoyed the game just as much if I'd paid a couple bucks for it.

Before the EBF series, he mosty used to create amateur animations that date back to as early as 2004. Considering he's around 26 now, I think you can imagine they were created and uploaded for fun, as a hobby.\nAnyway, back to the game.\n\nThe first game came out in 2009 and consisted exclusively of constant enemy waves and a boss fight every now and then until the very end. No savepoints too. The only \"break\" you had was a single potion shop. The fights themselves weren't very special too. Most of the time, it went like that:\nYou have two characters: damage dealer and a healer - equip the the damage dealer with the right weapon - spam one skill - the healer spams multiheal ability for 99% of the game.\nOf course it changed a bit on highest difficulty, but still the premise was the same.\nIt was Matt's first try at this kind of game and it kinda worked.\n\nThe second game added a few RPG elements, and by \"a few\" I mean that after every few waves of enemies (or a boss) you could upgrade one of your stats and pick a skill. It wasn't a deep system, but it was surprisingly fun to think of new strategies that it introduced, but othet than that, it was pretty much the same as the first game, with constant waves of enemies and bosses (this time you had two checkpoints however, each allowed you to save a game and also featured a mini-game where you kill undead cats as NoLegs -also a cat-the series' mascot)\n\nEBF3 is basically Matt's first semi-serious game. What do I mean by semi-serious? I mean that it's still very simple, rather short and not very deep, and it's also a browser game (the Steam version, which is free of course, only added stuff like higher Resolutions, fullscreen, turbo mode etc.).\n\nBut it's a start. It features an actual overworld which you can explore, search for treasures, secrets and quests.\nThere's also a normal levelling system and a whole lot of skills that can be upgraded separately. Combine that with more than 80 unique pieces of equipment and you get a fun jRPG-esque game which offers plenty of customisation and different tactics to defeat an enemy. Combat is still the main focus of the game and its core hasn't changed: you have a party, this time consisting of 3 party members, each with own strengths and weaknesses, battling waves of trash enemies and bosses until they die, not much to say.\nThe quests featured in the game are nothing more than simple fetch quests (or rather, getting some random crap from chests and enemy drops and giving them to an NPC), but hey - they're there.\nThe game isn't very long either, I finished the Steam release in under 8 hours while getting all the achievements, but those were fun 8 hours.\n\nOverall, if I were to compare EBF3 to budget games and AAA titles, that would be obviously unfair. The fourth game might be closer to that.\nBut as a simple browser game brought to Steam, I believe EBF3 deserves a solid 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1483033234, "timestamp_updated": 1483033234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.773712", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28751769": {"recommendationid": "28751769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061048547", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499815634}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego constituy\u00f3 un salto enorme desde su antecesor, que no era m\u00e1s que una sucesi\u00f3n de batallas por turnos con dos personajes ya desarrollados pero que ten\u00eda mucho encanto por su estilo flash, sus animaciones, enemigos, ataques, humor y referencias a la cultura pop por todas partes.\n\nAqu\u00ed te presentan la evoluci\u00f3n de ello, con un mapa para explorar, NPCs con sus misiones secundarias, personajes que subir de nivel desde 0...

Y los efectos visuales como las particulas son muy chulos.\n[*]Matt Roszak se merece mi respeto s\u00f3lo por haber llamado al jefe final como el villano de la [i]Emerald Sword Saga[/i] de Rhapsody of Fire, aunque ello provoca que eche en falta por ah\u00ed a alg\u00fan Dargor.\n[*]Los personajes son muy agradables, bastante chulos y sus di\u00e1logos muy entretenidos.\n[*]Mucha variedad en equipamiento y habilidades (para ser lo que es).

It's a bit annoying, but a mechanic all JRPG's seem to have.\n\nIt's alright for a free game, I got bored by the time I reached the desert and didn't feel like playing anymore, there's not enough depth, nor does the game have a story that compels me to keep playing.\n\nI can't really reccomend if I get bored of a game before completing it.\nI think I'll steer clear of the 4th as I see it's another silly flash game without a good story, but you have to pay $12 which to me seems too steep.", "timestamp_created": 1482029994, "timestamp_updated": 1482029994, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.377848", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28419535": {"recommendationid": "28419535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338798662", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511010234}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool Game!", "timestamp_created": 1481958167, "timestamp_updated": 1481958167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472086", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28396603": {"recommendationid": "28396603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335300827", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482108961}, "language": "english", "review": "AWESOME! great fun for some classic RPGing", "timestamp_created": 1481848318, "timestamp_updated": 1481848318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501292", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28383205": {"recommendationid": "28383205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065028024", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479286398}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ub9d0\ud558\uc790\uba74..\n[h1] \uac00\uc2b4,\uace0\uc591\uc774.", "timestamp_created": 1481786117, "timestamp_updated": 1481786117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28357957": {"recommendationid": "28357957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139249783", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481711740}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Gran juego de RPG por turnos al estilo cl\u00e1sico, con combates muy complejos y estrat\u00e9gicosm especialmente con los jefes. \nSi os gusta este g\u00e9nero, debe\u00eds probarlo sin dudarlo, aunque no est\u00e9 en vuestro idioma es muy sencillo de entender.\n\nSu duraci\u00f3n oscila entre las 10 y 15 horas, dependiendo de la dificultad que pong\u00e1is\n\nUn gran detalle a los creadores por ofrecer el juegod e forma totalmente gratuita.

being deleated. Playing it now on steam is great nostalgia. This is an epic game (yes I just went there) and is a masterpiece from the golden age of flash games. The game is funny, with wierd characters, and often fourth wall breaking npc dialogue. The three main characters are a sword loving warrior, a tree hugging mage, and an army guy who might be a nazi. Together the three heros go on a journy to defeat an ancient deity, who stole their powers and junk. On the way they slowly gain their powers and stuff back, eventually becoming powerfull enough to once again challange the deity. The game's combat is the best part. It is turn based, like most rpgs, but the characters can use awsome powers and weapons like orbital laser strikes, creating black holes, or causing giant swords to fall from the sky. All in all, this is one of my personal favorites, and I definitely reccomend it.\n\n10/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPs: Everyone says the minigames are really hard, but I got both the achievements for all of the minigames on my first try, no joke.

Eventually, in Attack of the Black Mages 5, we saw an early form of Natalie in the form of the White Mage. Around this time Matt started making games, with his first being mecha dress-up, which has been used to make several bosses, as well a quick-draw game called Brawl Royale\n     Eventually, Matt made his first turn-based RPG, simply called Epic Battle Fantasy. In it you played as Matt, the series offensive, and Natalie, the series healer. It didn't have much and isn't too interesting, only really play it if you want to understand a bit more history to the series. Then EBF 2 came out with a more coherent story tying in with the last game. It had more mechanics and was quite enjoyable, still worth playing. It introduced the first new party member, Lance, as the final boss.\n     That brings us to this, EBF 3, Matt's first big game. It has a good overworld, plenty of hidden treasure, amusing dialouge, an OK story, and anime boobs. Solid combat with a variety of skills (though not in all elements) and numerous enemies with different weaknesses, as well as many equips with varying effects, making customization strategically useful. It stars amazing music by Phyrnna (then called HalcyonicFalconX) and the final boss is great, with changing elements requiring you to go with an element-neutral strategy or to switch things up throughout the battle. Dialogue FROM Akron was interesting, making him less than flat at minimum. Completing it 100% does require a bit of luck alongside strategy and grinding, but you are rewarded with a bit of unique dialogue from the room behind Death. Overall an enjoyable game and quite good considering the developer's humble begginnings. Most (but not all) of the negative reviews I found were crude and not fair, but this game isn't flawless.

The fact that lessons were learned from game development and applied to an older work retroactively is great and EBF3 gains a lot by the numerous small improvements (e.g. being able to see a unit's Scan during battle), which is especially impressive considering that the game is still free.\n\nThe music is amazing, though sometimes there's some slight dissonance in the world and its music (for example: a sad song during a decidedly not sad snowy town). It should be mentioned, however, that the music direction is better than EBF2 and continues to improve in EBF4.\n\nThe battle system is simple, but never dull. A variety of skills help to set a unique strategy, though here too the trend for greater customizeability continues to EBF4.\n\nThe story is nothing spectacular, which should be mentioned, even if it doesn't try to be. However, the character interactions, while mostly humourous, do give some actual character development. The main characters may not grow out of character archetypes, but their dialogue is enough to keep one interested. Here we have one of the biggest improvements EBF3 has over EBF2.\n\nOn the whole, EBF3 is the middle game in a series of steady improvement. While not extraordinary on its own, it does serve as a reminder of how far the developer has come and is an acceptable entry point to the series.\n\nPS: I spent way too much time in the character creator.", "timestamp_created": 1480118801, "timestamp_updated": 1480118835, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27554250": {"recommendationid": "27554250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281338706", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512885771}, "language": "english", "review": "It's been over 6 years since I first played this game on Kongregate, and it is still one of my favorite rpgs of all time.\n\nEven if you're just a bit little curious, you should download it.

It is my personal favorite RPG of all time, but most people will disagree with me. There is almost no story whatsoever, the overworld is small and very linear, and the hand-drawn art style, while I think it looks perfectly fine, will be a turn-off for some people. \nHowever, this game has, in my opinion, the best battle system in any RPG I have ever played.

The abilities are very interesting to use, and the status effect system is very powerful, yet well-balanced. \n\nPositives: \n+Astoundingly-balanced battle system \n+FREE \n+Shorter RPG experience (for those who have little free time to play a 60+ hour RPG) \n+Decent soundtrack \n\nNegatives: \n-Almost non-existent story \n-Uninteresting overworld \n\nOverall, while it is my all-time favorite RPG, I can't really justify giving it a 10/10, given the flaws it has.

If you are just someone that is looking for a free, fun little retro inspired JRPG, and many jokes that refer to classic titles, then play this game, on Normal or Easy difficulty.\n\nWhy?\n\nThis game is HORRIBLY unbalanced!\n\nAs I tried to do a completionist run, I attempted the game on the hardest difficulty from the very start, Epic. From the very start I started to regret it. From the very beginning, you will be fighting 3+ monsters at a time. On top of that, while you only have attacks that ONLY hit one target once, monsters will have attacks that either attack you more than once, attack all your characters, have a chance to add a poison/stun per attack, or ALL OF THE ABOVE! From the very start of the game this is unfair, when you can basically be killed in 1 turn. You don't even learn spells/attacks that can attack more than once till you are almost at the first boss. So the game turns into a nightmare of a grind fest, killing all the enemies that you can up to a point, going back to town, then going from the start again to try and level up to fight the monsters that are killing you, get to the next screen where the monsters are harder, repeat to make very small progress.\n\nThen when you managed to make it to the boss, bosses as you would expect, have tons of health. On top of that though, they will spawn endless amounts of enemies, and either have a healing spell, or the enemies they spawn have healing spells. These healing spells usually heal for more than the amount of damage you can deal. Because of this, the bosses can take almost an hour!\n\nAnother issue that started to arise was starting at chapter 3, enemies started having 1 HIT KO moves (very rarely,) and they spammed them! After reaching chapter 4, this was the main reason why I could not progress. If I was not able to kill all the monsters before they got to attack, they would use their 1HKO moves, and they more than likely hit me (probably because the game hated me.) Even using gear to increase my dodge chance to 80%+ didn't even help ever.\n\nHaving sunk 10 hours into 1 playthrough and only making to the 4th chapter, I had to give up. I could not deal with the painful grind that I had to do to level up my characters/gear. Being at lvl 26 and not even half way through the 4th chapter, and STILL struggle with the enemies with their bullsh*t 1HKO moves, multiple hit attacks with poisons/stuns, and just being damage sponges, it's not fun. This game is technically only 4 hours long, and this should not be that bad. I know that grinding is meant to be a part of these kinds of games, I'm not new to these games, and I've grinded FAR worse games than this, but this grind is only made painful on the very small progress you make, and how unbalanced it is. And the main overall story/plot isn't very interesting. I honestly didn't give a damn about anything or anyone.\n\nNow, this is to all the people that are gonna say \"You are just playing the game wrong.\" I've leveled up my gear, I'm maxed out my spells, I've done all the things that people have told other people, and none of that matters. I experimented and tried the game on Normal just to see if there was a huge difference. In 20 min I beat the 1st chapter...\n\n\nPROS:\n- Fun little retro inspired JRPG.\n- Funny dialog. (But I didn't really care for it.)\n- Runs great, never crashed.\n- Good selection of different enemy types.\n- Good amount of gear.\n- Good amount of spells you can choose from.\n- Short, can be beat in 4 hours (on Easy/Normal.)\n- Very bright and colorful.\n- Music is OK. (I ended up turning it off when I was grinding and listening to my own music.)\n- Achievements. (You get an achievement for clicking on bewbs.

I haven't played Epic Battle Fantasy 1 & 2, but this game has a solid RPG core.\n\n[+]: \nThe humor is very welcome and goes very well with the game and characters. Turn-based battle style is always pleasing and enemies can sometimes come in waves. Abilities can be learnt on the go as long as one has enough AP through fights. Some monsters have to be cleared to access blocked areas. Status effects disappear right after a fight. Nice soundtrack.  Scanning enemies with a scouting device by someone who knows how to analyse monsters(the guy with the gun) to get valuable information on the enemy and update your bestiary(something that makes sense). Characters comment relevantly when stuff happen, and it does look like special attention was given to this: like when you just learnt an ability and use it to inflict damage on a specific enemy that is weak against it or if there's a secret nearby. Changing equipment changes appearance of the protagonist everywhere, everywhere!\n\n[-]:\nTeleporting between teleport points can be confusing as the portals in the warp zone are a bit confusing and unnamed, but are OK once gotten used to. Equiping equipment is a bit confusing, but enhancing them is very very easy and intuitive. Completing side quests is a bit confusing, as items can be dropped randomly or bought for very different prices, and acquisition of these are not very clear, plus the quest tracker doesn't give any location whatsoever of the quest-giver.\n\nThe GUI could have been more polished, and I'm guessing it is...in Epic Battle Fantasy 4(which I haven't played at the time of writing this), but that's how all the game developers do nowadays anyway. Plus at this moment, this is free and I guess more of a promotion for Epic Battle Fantasy 4, which is not free. \n\n[Performance]:\nThe graphics card DOES matter (personally), I have an integrated graphics (Intel HD Bay Trail) and gameplay is a bit choppy on MAX, have to put it on LOW resolution and frameskip ON in order to even have the game be playable, especially during screen transitions(very tolerable) and battle(most annoying, very laggy at higher settings).\n- Intel Atom Z3735F (with Intel HD Bay Trail)\n- LOW = unplayable ~20fps , frameskip makes it barely playable.\n\n[Note]:\nThere is no cloud save, and save files are not in My Documents, so beware ...

It offers a very cutesy art style, and can fool you into thinking that this game's battle's are just as childish. Well I can confirm,\n\nThat i've never been happier to be proven wrong.\n\nAfter beating the game on Epic difficulty, I was genuinely ecstatic, and I truly felt like I earned my victories. The Battle system is deceptively complex, with no two monsters created with the same strengths and weaknesses. Although this applies especially to the bosses, it can be said for normal enemies as well that if you mess up a turn, (on harder difficulties), You will be surprised at how many ways enemies can 100-0 you in 2 seconds flat.\n\nThis game never felt grindy, which is something all Rpg maker's should strive for, as it is the golden style they should all strive for. A lot of battles are optional, and I rarely had to \"grind\" at all, even on the higher difficulties.\n\nI beleive this is because the reason i lost battles was because of MY inputs in the fight. I never once thought \n\"Oh, this monster is way too strong for me to kill, it must be like twice my level!\", because the truth is, level does not really matter too much in this game. What matters in this game is YOU making smart decisions in battle. Because even after grinding my *ss off, there was no difference to how fast a boss KO'd me. This is a very unique element in this game that i beleive makes it the classic that it is.\n\nOh and one last thing. \n\nSome of the Music in this game is AMAZING.

You wander around the world, looting chests laying around the place, speaking to NPCs for quests, and battling foes in turn-based combat.  You gain equipment and skills as the game progresses, and certain enemies are weak against certain elemental spells and weapons.  Finally, you can buff your attacks and debuff your enemies in the ultimate quest to make your percentage points bigger than their percentage points.  However, this isn't simply a game of numbers.  Laid over the mechanics are a beautiful aesthetic design (both musical and artistic) and a light sense of humor.\n\nA common complaint about experience-based games is the grind often associated with them, but this game is designed well enough that you shouldn't have to grind for levels; though, it can sometimes give you the upper hand, especially on the higher difficulties, to go back and fight some of the more difficult battles once or twice to gain an extra level, some skills, and cash and items with which to upgrade equipment.\n\nOverall, I quite enjoyed this game; if I had to pick out one downside, it would be that Epic Battle Fantasy 4 improves upon this game in every conceivable way.

makes too amazing work to not get noticed. here is a link to her channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVcA2oPFhT2yGFEYfmgXbSQ\n\nnow then,\n\nI remember playing the original 1 and 2 on congergate when i was little en loving them to death, so seeing that it came to steam made me supper nostalgic. but with nostalgie comes some arogace so i wanted to play it just to see if the game was still as fun as it was those years before and i am pleasently suprised that the game is as fun as ever.\nthe game is a classic turnbased rpg with enough dept and custimazation to make it easy to learn but not dull to play. and if you want a extra challange you can crank up the difficulty (if you want your ass kicked by the game). what also is pleasant to see is the artstyle and the writing. the arstile is cute and varied enough to make every place feel like a advanture on its own. the animation is smooth and feels natural. the writing is amazing. it has a lot of good humor, the characters are likeble and the acazinal 4th wall break makes it something very special and unic.\nall in all if you like turnbased rpgs you will love this game\n\n8/10- one of the few games that wasn't killed by nostalgie",

I remember playing through this game back when I wa smuch younger, and to return to it now with a bit better grasp on a lot of the strategies, I think it was a worthy experience this game again. I even enjoyed it far more than I did when I use to play it (mostly because of the nostalgia factor).\n\nThe best part about this game is just that it looks decently well, for being made by Matt Roszak alone. Not to mention, the OST is truly epic. I expect nothing less from Phyrnna when it comes to releasing the traxks for these games. There are many other positive notes, such as the humor, the gameplay, and much more.\n\nThe only real downside to this game is that its not very well optimized, but then again I do have a sub par computer so running it smoothly should be no problem if you have a well-built computer.\n\nOut of everything in this game, I say I'd give it a 8.5/10. In the end, I highly recommend installing the game since its free. If you don't end up liking it, sorry if I said anything misleading.

Most bosses (And even some enemies) are challenging, but if you're having troubles most times all you need to do is level up once\n-Skill system is not related to the level you are, rather you unlock new skills by improving your current skills or learning new ones\n-Most weapons and armors when fully upgraded have game-changing abilities, giving you plenty of playstyle options\n-Earning medals/achievements is actually fun, for once\n-Dev actually listened to fans and improved the Steam version of the game by adding things like an in-game slider for the music and other options\n-It's FREE\n-The jokes and \"memes\" while being a bit dated still manage to make you giggle and remind you of the earlier internet days\n-Effects during combat are beautiful to look at\n-NG+ is present and gives multiple options, making it easier to get medals in case you forgot to scan some bosses\n-Challenging harder difficulties\n-Boobs and boobs accessories\n\nCons:\n-It's a game made with Flash, so slowdowns are present\n-Sadly no real way for a 720p or bigger resolution without fiddling with game files (not recommended) and the fullscreen option is just upscaled and blurry, which is sad because the game art is very pretty and would benefit from it\n-Frame rate capped at 30, you can get to 60 by using the speed up option but rather than switching between 30 and 60 it just speeds up the game, and even then it slows down a lot while playing, recommended for people having trouble with keeping 30 frames, frameskip is also a valid option\n-Some osts don't loop well\n-No controller support, it's possible to bind keys to your controller with external programs but mouse is still required to navigate menus and during battles\n-Some minigames can be really annoying if you plan on getting all achievements, although none of them are required to progress the game\n\n\nThe game for what it is, is a solid 9.5/10 for me, it's a must have for fans of turn-based RPGs.\nAlso there's cute anime bullshit.\nhttps://youtu.be/Skx1Ltag4R8", "timestamp_created": 1473321882, "timestamp_updated": 1473321905, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508680", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25406211": {"recommendationid": "25406211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054735238", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473308369}, "language": "english", "review": "Words n stuffs\n\n10/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1473308436, "timestamp_updated": 1473308436, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498640", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25405969": {"recommendationid": "25405969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032321963", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473432677}, "language": "english", "review": "tl;dr, I think the game i great. Nice, fun JRPG for free. Worth a try.\n\nOut of the 5 negative Steam reviews this currently has, only 1 actually making a point. This point, however, is pretty minor. \n\nThe review said the game was 'a nightmare grind-fest'. That on world 3, he went back and did half an hour of grinding, because the enemies were getting hard.\n\nSounds like most RPG games, to me. You grind to get your characters more powerful, to get better equipment, get more usable items, and the such. Grinding is often a part of RPG games. Even then, he said he spent half an hour doing it. First, doesn't sound that long to me. Second, I didn't have to spend that much time grinding in any one point. Might be becaue I ran back through areas a couple times when I went back to loot search, or might be because I was better equipped or better using my abilities.\n\nOther than that, though, the negative reviews have not pointed out any other flaws. As other positive reviews have said, this game is a downgrade from EBF4 in pretty much every way. Most important part of that is the price. This game is quite fun, and is completely free, which is a great way to show off what is in your later games. Gets people loving what you make and makes you want to see what else they have.\n\nOnly complaint I've got is the extreme difficulty near the end. Enemies that dispell you, then can take off all your health on the very next turn? Right, thanks. And that's on normal difficulty. I can't imagine that any harder.\n\nAnyways, game is great for the price. You should totally purchase it.

The place it really shines is combat and progression. As someone who's played a long line of turn based RPG's, I can easily say the EBF series has some of the best working combat systems in the genre, which has been something that's always had me coming back to it. And while it doesn't really change up the game in any insane ways from other games in the genre, everything here is extremely polished and that alone makes it a great journey. \n\nCombat: You have HP. The enemies have HP. You have a magic knight, mage, a gunner, and a legless cat as support. You attack, use skills, magic, and items until the enemy is dead. It's the tale as old as time, but EBF3 just refined the mechanics very, very well so that the whole game feels pretty smooth. Although EBF3 does include a wave system, so that some battles are actually linked together without a break in between. It's rather neat, and makes you think ahead before you finish off all the current enemies. \n\nProgression: EBF3 does this cool thing where it shows you all the skills you can learn off the bat. You just have to gather the AP to learn them (Something you obtain from all battles). You can learn the skills in almost any order (Some do have prerequistes) and upgrade them as you go through the game. You will feel a definite shift in power as your characters go from what feels like new adventurers to powerful heroes that could take on anything. \n\nEquipment: You know how it kind of bites in most JRPGs where when you equip the next armor level, it doesn't actually change the character's looks? Well, EBF3 is the game where every single armor, weapon, and headgear changes how a character looks. And a lot of the armor sets are pretty fantastic (The Officer's Uniform is a personal favorite). But a big part of the game is how equipment is very important to how battles play out. Resistances will make or break a battle, as well as weaknesses. But the game gives a very, very generous option to change your equipment in the middle of combat in case you made a mistake, or your enemies change and you need to switch to a different weapon. Another very, very cool thing the game does is it's upgrade system. You can upgrade your equipment which provides the standard increased stats as any normal game, but the higher upgrade levels straightup give new abilities to the equipment your using. Example, some weapons gain the ability to counter when hit when you upgrade them higher. One last cool thing it does it how the weapons stats are all balanced with each other, meaning you don't actually obtain better gear as you go through the game, just different gear. No gear is better then the rest, but it depends on the current situation which gear is the best. (That being said, Heaven's Gate is the best sword) \n\nDifficulty: The game is extremely fair with it's difficulty. Because the game increases the amount of experience you get by area, it is very difficult to become extremely overpowered and just slaughter everything early. Not only that, because of how it works, Grinding is something I almost never needed to do throughout the game, save for one period near the end of the game, and even that was only for around 20 minutes. And I played the game on it's highest difficulty, Epic, where the enemies all did 60% more damage automatically. The Bosses are also appropriately balanced, and often require more then a little thinking to defeat. That being said, the game's secret room, unlocked only when have all 60 achievements/medals is entirely unfair and completely evil. \n\nStory: There's a demon which sucks up the powers of the the three protagonists because they needed to be weaker so we could have a game. Story isn't the intent of the Epic Battle Fantasy series, and it's mainly used as an excuse for the game's fantastic combat and several jokes. This does mean this isn't the place to look for a deep story or long running narrative, but this also means you don't need to play any of the other games in the series to be really prepared to play this one. \n\nClosing Statement: This game is pretty fantastic because it achieves what it sets out to do. If you're looking for complex storytelling, look away from here. But if you're looking for a pretty fun time on a game that has a fantastic battle system, a great equipment system, some good comedy, and don't feel like spending any money at the moment, this is the place to go. \n", "timestamp_created": 1473155784, "timestamp_updated": 1473155784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25376660": {"recommendationid": "25376660", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992828613", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490142905}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a wonderful game for free.

I still need to clear out the monsters in the last hidden area, but other than grinding to do that, I've beaten this game.\n\nIt's a fun, easy, colorful, and well-designed RPG with catchy music and a \"free\" price tag to boot. There's lots of stupid humor, immature jokes here and there, and adorable monsters to smack for loots 'n' levels. And to make things even better, he's added a bunch of useful features that were not there on the web version! I absolutely adore the frame rate buttons, and I love that we can now see monster stats at any time during your turn. And Lance doesn't die so much! Woo! The difficulty is well-scaled so even newbies can play and beat it on lower difficulties, while the Epic difficulty can cause you to actual plan your fights and not be impossible!\n\nSo what's not to like? As far as I'm concerned, there is nothing horrible about EBF3, though there are a few bad things. The game doesn't look nearly as nice on full screen as EBF4 an BH2 do, but it still looks pretty good. There are a few spelling errors here and there, but nothing major.

Cutting edge enemies became barely beatable so I'd spend half an hour grinding weaker ones to make the cutting edge stuff manageable.

It began as a simple wave by wave RPG, without much reason as to why you fight. It featured many cameos from famous franchises. In this installment and on, this was where the series began to adopt its own identity, saving cameos for mere references (some more obvious than others). I am a huge fan of the series, and I'm excited to see it reach beyond its \"flash\" game status. It may look, sound and play like one, but Matt (aka KupoGames) Rozsak knows to stretch its limits to create a wonderful game.\n\n\nThe customization is wonderful in this game. There are three characters, two of them male and one female. This dictates what equipment they can use. All three have their own unique weapon, and those weapons including their clothes, can be forged to become better. You may find certain equipment just plain better than others, if they essentially give the same resistants. The characters' clothes appear in the pictures of the dialogue boxes, and while wandering on the overworld, and of course in battle. I love when games do this.\n\nThe music, by the amazing Phyrnna (the game explains this in one of the menus viewable from the main menu) is phenomenal. Easy to get stuck in your head.\n\n\nThis is where I shift to comparing this one to EBF4. Obviously, you may think that this one's better because it's free on Steam compared to that, right? Well, I suppose, but...\nI'd argue the fourth game is much better. Menu management was slightly more difficult in this one compared to the fourth, even playing this one before. In EBF4, gone is most of the text walls, and statistics and elements are made into easy identifiable pictures. When seeing enemy weaknesses, instead of percentages (like in EBF4), it is just text in this game. I personally don't find it a problem since it typically wouldn't want to use a resisted element on an enemy, but for those who have a hard time remembering which enemies actually absorb or resist elements it can make it quite a hassle.\n\nYou can always scan enemies to see their weaknesses and resistances. However, in this game, you can only scan one enemy at a time, and only Lance, can do it. You can always flee from the fight and restart to get free scans, but this may be tedious. In the fourth game, the scan becomes a scanbot, and a Summon that anyone can use, as well as being able to scan every new enemy in battle. Obviously I can't be too hard on it, since this one did come out first.\n\nThe game's humor, you could say, comes partly from Internet memes. Obviously not everyone is going to care all that much for it, but the humor doesn't neccessarily stop there. I'm not going too much into detail because well... its a side thing. Humor isn't that important here. There are a few grammatical errors, but that's alright. It shouldn't ruin your fun of the game. Many of them are also probably intentional anyhow, for the \"illiterate\" NPCs. I'm sure I've made a few in this review anyhow.\n\nAt its core, this is an RPG series where the main idea is just having fun destroying foes with sheer numbers, and obliterating them as their waves come. It definitely takes its inspiration from other RPG series, but it's all in good fun, and it revels in its craziness.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf you just like having a fun time, and a fairly difficult albeit short game (hey we can't be that ambitious for a previously Flash game) this is the one for you. If you're deciding on this game or EBF4, I would say start with this one, even though I've mentioned the other one is better. This is free, and in case you linger for more than two hours on the sequel only to find its not your style, you should let this one dictate how much you enjoy the battles. Yes, the menus are a bit more difficult to manage in this one, but the battles are what count mostly.

Epic Battle Fantasy is one such gem.\nIt is said that, to be successful, you just have to be a little bit better than everyone else, and in every way, EBF3 delivered.

They each come with a variety of custom skills and abilties to unlock and level up, providing multiple different play-styles. There is also three slots of Gear for each character, for head, body and weapon. While the standard style would be Matt as a tank, Lance as DPS and Natalie as support, you can switch it around however you want. Matt can be a proficient Mage DPS, Lance can be support and Natalie can...Well, she can be a mage, but the choice to bonk things with her is there.\n\nA lot of game is here, and a lot of fun.

Why is this? Most modern RPGs seem to test the player's patience and ability to continue level grinding and farming drops. This isn't necessarily a bad thing in games such as MMOs, but when I'm enjoying a story-driven single player game, I'd like to feel a little more immersed. \n\nEpic Battle Fantasy, on the other hand, takes the concept of grinding and throws it in the shredder. Most of the leveling you need is obtained just by playing through the story, so the only time you'll find yourself fighting extra enemies on the side is if you want to upgrade some skills with AP, a point system used to unlock new skills and make them stronger. By the end of the game, the player will likely be at max level and have all skills maxed, so being underleveled at any given point isn't really a thing that could happen.\n\nThese points aren't even the greatest part of why I recommend the series, though. As I said, in most RPGs you can just grind for some time and then be absolutely golden for the remainder of the game. In Epic Battle Fantasy, however, no matter how overleveled you think you may be, you'll be on-edge and strategizing through every battle, even the normal encounters (Though ESPECIALLY with bosses, obviously). You need to think about what elements to use, and what elements to protect yourself from with equipment, which you can switch mid-battle in case the enemies vary in type. \n\nWithout proper preparation, you could start a turn with full HP, and end the turn with a game over. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing; in fact, I believe it to be an amazing feeling. Plus, if it's too much for you, you can always just hit up easy mode. There's 4 difficulty settings so it's pretty accessible for anybody. \n\nMy overall point here is that the EBF games give a nostalgic RPG feel that most modern games can't deliver anymore because they all revolve around grinding for success now. Epic Battle Fantasy brings back the concept of ACTUALLY THINKING through your battles, and I absolutely love it for that.\n\n\n...oh, and there's boob jiggles :)", "timestamp_created": 1472758342, "timestamp_updated": 1480115247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573623", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25291223": {"recommendationid": "25291223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055542088", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472759046}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're looking through the reviews to figure out if you should get this, look no further.\n\nFor you should already have this, now scroll back up and get cracking.", "timestamp_created": 1472757334, "timestamp_updated": 1472762289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496552", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25290194": {"recommendationid": "25290194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096555004", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1946, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 203, "last_played": 1516300700}, "language": "english", "review": "Just like the 4th installment of the series, this game has great story, detailed graphics, & spot-on hilarious dialogue.

Dont mention my playtime. I have played this game back in the days on the internet. \n\nI hope I can give you an insight about this masterpiece, that is called EBF3. I will go through every possible aspect of this game and give it a final score.\nBut what exactly do you do in EBF3? \nIts a jRPG, where you go through the game and fight bosses, which become stronger and stronger. You start in a little town after a short cutscene. Afterwards you explore different locations, from a forest, up to a volcano and beyond. Every location has a boss, which you have to defeat, in order to continue your journey. Throughout the game are hidden chests. They often contain really nice items, like weapons and armors. At some places you can talk to NPCs and start a quest. They mostly consist of collect x amount of y. The rewards are really useful though. A lot of the quests will reward you with new skills, which are otherwise unattainable. Overall its a typical jRPG. Kill, grow stronger and kill the final boss.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]: 8/10\n\nThe story itself isn't really worth mentioning. Your team consists of 3 heroes which loose their powers at the beginning of the game. I wouldn't say that this game has a serious story. It is rather a funny story, which will yet keep you hooked and will entertain you throughout the game. You will read a lot of puns and jokes about Natalies boobs, but they arent really annoying or childish. Matt (the main hero) is your typical swordsmaster, Lance (my personal favourite) is your typical pervert and arms maniac and Natalie is your typical (hot) magician. You will learn to love each of them. Nothing too bad but also nothing too good.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]: 10/10\n\nThis is where the game REALLY shines. I really enjoyed every second of this game. The combat system of EBF3 is really entertaining and the boss battles are really tough. Beware though that I played this game on the highest difficulty. Even if you level up your heroes, the bosses will still provide a nice challenge. If you approach them the wrong way, you're screwed. Don't get me wrong though. Even though the bosses are challenging even after grinding for xp and materials, they are never unfair. You always know, that you could've done it better and might have saved up your limitbreak for a certain boss attack. As every RPG you level up by killing monsters, after you've reached a certain amount of XP. But other than leveling up, you also got equipment. Equipment in this game is REALLY essential, as it can mean victory of defeat in this game (thats why I said you'll never feel like you have been treated unfair, after loosing a battle). Each equipment part has its own stats. Some have resistances against fire attacks,ice attacks and so on, some apply certain buffs, some weapons deal elemental damage, some equipment parts will increase your resistance to certain debuffs like blind, silence and so on. As you can see, you can prepare yourself for every battle in EBF3. Beware though, there are some enemies who will change their elemental resistance throughout the battle. So you have to change your weapon for example from fire to ice and so on. Every weapon and equipment can be upgraded up to 5 times. Upgrading will cost materials (Materials can also used to complete certain quests). Each upgrade will increase their effectiveness by (most of the time) 10%. Level 4 to 5 will also ocasionally have an extra effect. For example Matts sword Heavens Gate will counter enemy attacks, when it's level 4 and will sometimes cast shine on level 5. \nNow to the skills. Every character can learn skills from a skill tree(Each has their own skill tree though). Usually you are free to pick every skill you want in the order you want. But you have to keep in mind that each skill has its own price. From the skill tree you can also learn your limitbreak. Limitbreaks are special attacks, which are avaivable after your characters have taken a certain amount of damage. These are especially strong attacks, which can be devastating.\nThere are some minigames, which can be REALLY frustrating, if you want 100% in EBF3 and especially if you want to unlock the secret dungeon,which you do once you got every achievement. But if you are patient enough, you will master these minigames too. They also reward you with items and gold.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]: 10/10\n\nEBF3 has one of the best soundtrack I've heard. Every location has a song, that will blow your mind and suits the theme of it perfectly. You can easily listen to the soundtrack, while browsing the net or playing another game. I never got annoyed by any song in this game. Best of all? You get every song for free as mp3.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]: 10/10\n\nI cant speak for the lower difficulties, since I've only played on the hardest setting. But hell this game is REALLY hard. Some might call me noob, but there were a lot of times, I got so frustrated, that I just needed a break. (Final boss reference ;)  ) As I have mentioned above though, you never want to quit the game forever because of the difficulty. You rather want to try again and again and again, grind a little and then try again, until you've beaten the boss. This game has one of the best rpg combat systems I've seen. Every boss has its own weakness and some certain things you have to watch out for. I really loved fighting every boss in this game. They all were a nice challenge and you had that feeling, that you have accomplished something. The best boss for me was the final boss. I remember back in the days, that I had quit this game, because I thought I'd never beat him. Several months later I tried again and again until I kicked his butt. Best moment of my life. Didn't regret anything. So if you're seeking a challenging game, try EBF3 on epic difficulty.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]: 10/10\n\nIt is, what it is. It's not 3d but yet the game and its locations look beautiful. Maps are designed with love, they dont look boring or repetetive. Everything is colorful, lively and well thought. I'm judging the graphics based on what it is. \n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]: 10/10 tl;dr\n\nThis game is a must have, if you love turn based rpgs. Awsome music, awesome combat system, awesome game and awesome dialogues ;). It's for free and has the soundtrack included. You will have a lot of fun with it. The actual playtime is based on your difficulty you play on. The epic difficulty can really take a lot of time to beat. I'd say from 10-30hours, depending on how good you are. \n\nSo for your own sake, download the game already and play it.

Generally like most RPGs/JRPGs.\n\nPros:\n\n+Fast to download\n+Cats\n+Great soundtrack\n+Multiple difficulties.\n+*Boobs\n+*Big boobs\n+*Clickable boobs\n+Fun gameplay\n+Made by someone who lives in Britan.\n+I can't think of any cons.\n+Free downloadable soundtrack as well.\n\n*Please note there are no nude boobs.", "timestamp_created": 1472752526, "timestamp_updated": 1490893568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554664", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25289741": {"recommendationid": "25289741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069252628", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472765547}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember playing this on newgrounds.

You'll know exactly what you're getting. It's free anyway.\n\nI played this game originally on Kongregate, so ignore my brief play time. Epic Battle Fantasy 3 (EBF 3) is funny, quirky and well made and free. Yes. Quality content for free.\nEdit: Finished the game. Reviews points remain.\n\nThe simple turn-based combat that harkens to a simpler RPG time coupled with hilarious dialogue and references makes for plenty of hours of fun. Plenty of collectibles and medals to satiate the inner-collector, perfectionist and achievement hunter. All of this can be done while listening to the great tunes of Phyrnna, who was responsible for most, if not all, of the music across all the games.\n\nThere were several quality of life improvements made that I greatly appreciate from Matt Roszak, the developer (aka Kupo Games). Rather than simply port EBF 3, it was improved upon, and if the minigames were as I remembered, an increase in easiness is VERY APPRECIATED. The link to all the features he added is below\nhttp://kupogames.com/2016/08/31/ebf3-final-new-features-list/\n\nThe game graphics are as cute and endearing as ever, though its age did show in the full screen mode due to the resolution. I am however more than happy playing it in its windowed mode and give that and its few missing quality of life features a pass. For a flash game released 6 years ago, the game still holds up well in my eyes.\n\nAll in all, a definite recommend to RPG fans. Exactly what it says on the tin, and best of all, there's no need to wait years for its sequel. EBF 4 is already here (free on web only). Just scroll down.\n\nEdit: There is a 2x speed function which I also greatly appreciated since I already played the game before and wanted to speed run it. It definitely helps speed up battles once you're done enjoying all the animations from the skills.", "timestamp_created": 1472748626, "timestamp_updated": 1473248822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500037", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25286951": {"recommendationid": "25286951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149378659", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497898441}, "language": "english", "review": "Epic Battle Fantasy 3 was a fantastic game before, and is a fantastic game now. This updated version is a great introduction into the EBF series, as it's free and simpler than EBF4. If you're unsure about whether or not you want to buy EBF4, play this game first - while EBF3 is much simpler, the core concepts are the same.\n\nThis game is full of colour and humour, and has a little something for everyone - oversized weapons, adorable enemies, fantastic boss fights, and anime boobs. While on the outside, the game seems cartoony and silly, the actual gameplay is refined and revolves around a lot of strategy, but has difficulty settings for everyone. On Easy mode you can get away with making mistakes, but on Epic mode you've [i]got[/i] to know what you're doing and how you're going to do it. Of course, real men play on Epic mode.\n\nNow, my two favourite parts of the game: the boss fights, and the music. The boss fights in this game are actually quite challenging, but not to a frustrating point. They feel fair but tricky, and each boss has a strategy around it that keeps you on your toes. Each boss is different and brute force only gets you so far.\n\nIf you've read any reviews for any EBF-related game before, you'll have heard about the quality of the soundtrack - EBF3 is just one of several games with a fantastic soundtrack. The overworld music sets the atmosphere for each area so well, and the battle music is incredible - particularly the boss fights.\n\nNow, unfortunately I have to compare it to EBF4. 3 is like a bite-size version of 4; both have epic music, great gameplay and interesting characters, but 4 is just so much more refined and polished, and introduces so many new mechanics. However, they're both great games. Chances are if you don't like 3, you probably won't like 4...and if you like 3, you'll [i]love[/i] 4.

Also, disclosure, I got a Steam key a few days early and have been playing, Let's Playing and writing reviews of these games for years so I guess you could argue I'm looking at this through the lens of a rather hyperbolic fanboy.[/h1]\n\n[h1]Good[/h1]\n\nSo, what to say about Epic Battle Fantasy 3. On the one hand, it's a silly Flash game, it looks like a silly Flash game, it sounds like a silly Flash game, it's written like a silly Flash game and I suppose you could argue that it plays like a silly Flash game, but it's all put together very well. The art and graphics isn't [i]fantastic,[/i] but the style is very cohesive and the world map isn't so big that it starts to look repetitive. The sound effects and battle animations are cartoony and the characters sometimes exclaim \"kek\" (sic) or similar in battle, but it works because the entire [i]game[/i] has a cartoony aesthetic. The writing . . . well, you're probably not playing this kind of game if you want to experience Tolkien or Rowling, and, say it with me, the silly over-the-top save-the-world plot goes nicely with the silly over-the-top world of menacing giant squid and sentient giant monolith things.\n\nThe battles themselves are a turn-based system where you get to attack first every turn, there is no \"speed\" or \"agility\" stat, so I guess it doesn't toe the JRPG line [i]perfectly.[/i] Anyway, there isn't too much to say about the battles except that they can easily fall into the \"Fire attack, heal and repeat\" pattern and you can probably beat Easy and Normal modes that way, but if you want to strategize a little more there is a bit more you can do with playing with status effects and changing equips mid-battle.\n\nIf you want a full list of differences/fixes between this and the web version, [url=http://kupogames.com/2016/08/31/ebf3-final-new-features-list/]see here[/url].\n\n[h1]Bad[/h1]\n\nThere are a couple spelling/English errors here and there throughout the game. It doesn't look terribly professional but they realistically don't have any affect on how the game plays so please don't bother complaining about it. I have no idea if they're going to be patched out by the time the game itself is released or anything like that.\n\nThere are a couple places where the music doesn't loop perfectly. But the music's still great so you won't see me complaining that some battle theme is half a measure off at the end or something.\n\n[h1]I obviously have to compare this game to its successor, [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/265610/]EBF4[/url], at some point, so here you go[/h1]\n\nEBF4 boasts a longer story, fancier graphics, more to explore, Battle Mountain and a bunch of other things, but in a lot of strange ways I enjoy this game better. The battle system has fewer moves available and feels less overwhelming to start out with, and there are few enough that you could realistically try out all (most) of them throughout the course of a single playthrough. The game and game world themselves are shorter, and the level cap is 30 (I think the final enemies in the game top out at about level 32 or 33), so the end-game battles feel somewhat less long and dragged out. Lastly, while EBF4 overall probably has better music, [url=https://phyrnna.bandcamp.com/track/youll-never-guess-this][i]You'll Never Guess This[/i][/url] is easily my favorite song in all of Flash games.\n\nAlso, the font is in Comic Sans. I personally am in favor of adding DLC to EBF4 and Bullet Heaven 2 that changes all of the fonts in the game to Comic Sans.\n\n[h1]tl;dr[/h1]\n\nGood game, and if you don't believe me it's free (as in it doesn't even cost money) so there really is no downside to downloading it and trying it out for twenty minutes.\n\n[s]If I see anyone reply with \"I hate anime games\" I will make sure to personally strangle you with a small planet.[/s]", "timestamp_created": 1472738071, "timestamp_updated": 1472738071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.660029", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25285802": {"recommendationid": "25285802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104493420", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506088193}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply wonderful.

Like many others, I stumbled upon this game years ago on one of the various flash game sites you could find online. This particular game itself is what got me into the series, However the problem always lied with the save system. (Or more accurately, The lack thereof.)\n\nEager as I was to explore the game and its story, Being able to actually save your progress was all but impossible as the moment I closed the game tab, Any record of what I had done so far would be wiped. I've tried this multiple times over a period of years, To the point where I just decided to try and clear the entire game in one session. (Looking back now it probably wasn't the smartest move. In the event that you're genuinely curious, My flash player gave out right before you reached Akron... Devastating I know, But we're getting off track). While I had the luxury to try and do so, Many people were denied that and likely never progressed past the forest zone which is a shame because this was a really well done flash game \n\nI seriously doubt any of the other installments will be brought over to steam for various reasons, However this particular game received the revival it deserved. It's for that very reason I say: Thank you Matt Roszak.

There's even minigames and fan art, and quests to do.\nThere's a variety of loudouts to choose from, and many skills to use. There's even limit breaks!\n(There's also 7 save slots I think, so you could have multiple games at once, or just save over it.)\n\nThe only problems I see is that if you go fullscreen, the graphics aren't as good, and if you check out the fan art before unlocking it, you can briefly see the image before the \"LOCKED\" thing appears.\n\nSo, if you're a fan of Matt Kupo's work, or Phyrnna's music, or you played this and want the nostalgia to come to you, or you like humour, or RPG's, or the art style, you should probably check this out.\nAnd if you don't?\nCheck it out anyways, it doesn't require much from your computer.\n\nOther games by Matt Kupo (and sometimes Phyrnna) would be:\nEBF\nEBF2\nEBF4 (On Steam)\nBullet Heaven\nBullet Heaven 2 (On Steam)\nAdventure Story\nBrawl Royale (Reaction based game)\nCat Cafe (On mobile I think)\n\n\nAnd also yay I'm first.", "timestamp_created": 1472730873, "timestamp_updated": 1472730873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714317", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39596369": {"recommendationid": "39596369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098572186", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506383709}, "language": "spanish", "review": "childhood <3\n\n\n\n(i got stuck at the hydra dragon and now after who knows how many years later i finally beated it and completed the game)", "timestamp_created": 1516852149, "timestamp_updated": 1516852149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 9, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "total_positive": 568, "total_negative": 26, "total_reviews": 594}}

The only difference is that instead of balloons, you have bugs. The objective is to kill all the bugs in a given level by a specified time limit. You use a machine gun called Ol'Reliable and as you kill bugs, the game will drop boxes that contain weapons such as the rocket launcher, laser beam, lightning gun and gatling gun. The game loop is as follows, play 5 levels of the same floor, go to the elevator and move to the next floor. Rinse and repeat. There are only 5 levels and the only differences between them is the artwork. You will get the same level with only walls blocking you.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's best to use a controller. Basically, you only need to move left and right, shoot upwards and use your special power. That's it. The special powers come in Boot Juice (where you shoot faster and become invincible), Freeze Grenade (where everything freezes), Homing Missiles (a whole bunch of missiles fly out from out from you).\n\nConclusion, this isn't really recommendable. The developers, Awfully Nice Studios, made only 5 levels and repeated them over and over again. I was hoping that there was going to be more, like another zone but no. Their entire scheme seems to be to entice players with good marketing and screw the content. Thus, I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone. They draw mechas and alien mouths but that's it. They are just drawings and not a tangible boss to fight against.\n\nNote : Awfully Nice Studios is a 2 man team located in Kustein, Austria.\n\n[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]\n1. Simple Controls\nMove left and right and shoot. How much more complexity is there? You don't even need to roll, jump or slide.\n\n2. Faster Pace Relative to Other Balloon Poppers\nIt's definitely more interesting compared to the slow pace of other balloon poppers.\n\n3. The Forge Hammer\nThat is the only stage that I felt was different as you had to avoid the hammer crushing you. All the other stages were just the different coloured backgrounds. Even the mouth spitter didn't count.\n\n[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]\n1. Only 5 Levels\nSeriously? That's it? For such simple gameplay, I was expecting at least 20 different levels. You drew big mechs in the background but it never came to pass. \n\n2. Short Game\nIt's over in 2 hours. 1 hour if you play easy mode.\n\n3. Really Few Mechanically Different Enemies\nMost of the enemies just bounce around like balls hitting the walls. You've only got a few interesting models like the lightning bug, scientist eater and big bouncing boss.\n\n4. No Online Multiplayer\nIt's local co-op max. For a game like this, it would be a simple addition for direct hosting.\n\n5. Repeating the Same Level\nThis is one of the worst sins. If all you do for every level is change the artwork in the background, at the very least, you could have updated the background each time you play another stage. To play the same level 5 times over is just bad design. A simple additional effect would have made it so much better. E.g. Alarms could go off in stage 2, mechanical arms could go haywire.\n\n6. False Advertising\nWhat is the deal with the mecha? I feel extremely disappointed with this one.

I think a lot of developers get this wrong about the gamers. we want the 2d old style playabilty but that doesnt mean we want the crappy pixelated graphics. sure you gona get those hipsters that try to make out they artisitc and \"real\" and thats why they play pixel shite and all that crap. but hipsters are a tiny minority so well done for using your brains devs.\n\nSo this game has very nice graphics and playablity with a fun storyline. It has the humar and imagination to keep it fun and interesting. I love how the blue bug grabs your friend and tries to steal him. this adds that dynamic that requires you to be aware of everything around you. its brilliant. Im a games developer and its very easy to add features, however most features can ruine a games dynamic and take away fun instead of adding more fun. \n\nThe only feature i think would be great to add is to have local 2 player option.\n", "timestamp_created": 1512043016, "timestamp_updated": 1512043016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37838701": {"recommendationid": "37838701", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992874771", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 16764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501098002}, "language": "english", "review": "fun quick play game", "timestamp_created": 1511829916, "timestamp_updated": 1511829916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37773219": {"recommendationid": "37773219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047354992", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511841222}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR Great spiritual sucessor to Super Buster Bros! Buy this game! \n\nI grew up playing Super Buster Bros (Aka Super Pang in Japan) I've been wanting a new instalment in the series ever since I was a kid. So I'm a bit bummed I only just heard about this game today--more than a year after its release. The vertical shooting is still here and the aliens burst just like the bubbles did in the old game on the SNES. The presentaion is solid. The Bug Butcher is quite sassy and there's a solid charm to the game. Despite some modern additions to make the game more accessible there is plently of challege here that I expect to be coming back to. I can see my self take a whirl at the harder difficulty trying to max out my scores and combos to perfection.  \n\nI was going to wait and see if the game made it to the Nintendo Switch, as that's where I prefer to play these sorts of games, but in the sale at $2.39USD I'm more than happy to buy it now than wait indefinetly for something that might not come.

Why? Because it is simple and addictive little game. Older players will find the mechanics similar to the \u2018Pang\u2019 game of many, many years ago.\n\nThe premise is simple, there are creatures bouncing around and you shoot them, however when they are hit, they will split up into smaller aliens, until they are to small to further split up and only then truly die. In the very early levels this is pretty easy, but as you can imagine, more enemies will be on the playing field in later levels and things get hectic pretty fast.\n\nIt\u2019s better then Pang in many ways. First, the enemies have attacks, which the balloons in Pang never had. That is OK because you have so many power-ups available and between levels you can upgrade your weapons, speed, armor, etc.\n\nSecondly, The crispy hand-drawn 2D graphics are full of colors and charm, excellent animations which go hand-in-hand with excellent sound effects. The weapons all have a satisfying sound as well as the splattering-splut sound when killing aliens. Characters speak goobly gook between eachother, not sure if that was really needed, but it doesn\u2019t take away any of the fun.\n\nOn top of the excellent single player game, you can also play this with a buddy, turn up the hectic dial to 11!\n\nHighly recommended if you\u2019re looking for a no-nonsense, simple, straight forward, shoot\u2019em\u2019up.\n\nWorks without a hitch on SteamOS/Linux, plays like a charm with the Steam Controller and streams to the Link without issues.", "timestamp_created": 1510399841, "timestamp_updated": 1510399841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36394705": {"recommendationid": "36394705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065648677", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497044998}, "language": "english", "review": "For me it was like a Hardcore Version of the old school game Pang.

Although I didn't know about Pang, I had played a rip-off game from Miniclip many years ago called Bubble Trouble.\nBasically, you can only shoot up, and large enemies split into smaller enemies.  \nPang didn't have a gun, but a hook that would disappear once it hit an enemy or the ceiling, and enemies would die even by hitting the hook's \"trail\". In this sense, The Bug Catcher is more traditional, i.e. you have an actual gun that functions like one - although you can only shoot vertically.\n\nThe core gameplay is just really fun! But I would also say that the developers structured the game very nicely.\n\nThe core gameplay is basically predicting the enemies' arc movements to avoid them, while clearing the screen. This requires quite a lot of focus, but it's very satisfying. \nI'm focusing on the single-player missions. There is also an Endless both, both for single player and for co-op. (I actually didn't enjoy co-op very much. But I usually don't anyway? I like to concentrate on the game I'm playing and that doesn't work very well with other people, but maybe that's just me...)\n\nThe levels are a mixture of reflex and memorization, if you're going for all the objectives. \nEach level has 3 stars for score, and an additional objective to hit a X-combo. Your combo meter is incremented every time you kill an enemy, but it's reset when you don't kill any enemy for 4-6 seconds.\nI think this is the part that made the game so enjoyable for me. Because in every level, you're trying to figure out the order in which to kill the enemies so that you don't lose your combo, and maximizing your score as a result. A higher combo gives you a higher score, exponentially (it seemed).\n\nThere are 5 areas. They play similarly, but each one has a different environmental hazard. One has a hammer that comes down in the center of the room, from time to time, another has breakable (and respawnable) platforms at some height, etc.\nEach area has 6 levels, the 6th being a special elevator level that introduces some tougher enemies - minibosses, if you will - that will appear later in the game.\n\nSo, 30 levels in total, which took me maybe 7-7.5 hours to master. All objectives on every level. I often get frustrated when going for these \"perfect\" scores in most game, but not on this one. The whole time, I was focused enough and enjoying myself the whole time. That very rarely happens.\n\nSo yeah, I don't know exactly why, but this game is really, really, good. The modes designed seem to bring the best out of the core gameplay.\n\nThere are also temporary guns and powerups, which are good to give some variety to repeated retries. Temporary invincibility, freeze enemies, etc. The weapons are usually better screen clearers than your basic weapon.\nYou upgrade all of this, although the upgrade system is fairly shallow.\n\nNot much weapon or power-up variety, but I honestly think it doesn't need it. The core game is that satisfying that it doesn't need much dressing up.\n\n\nNot as descriptive as most of my reviews, I guess. But I don't think there's much to describe, here. The game isn't very original - mostly a derivative of Pang with some modern aspects. Yet, it works. Really well!\n\nSo yeah, definitely give it a go if the game seems up your alley.

Story is pretty non existent. I didn't experience any issues or crashes. Some of the menu screens were a bit tedious to navigate around, but that's about the only annoying thing I came across. Controls are very tight (even on keyboard). You can rebind all the keys if required. \n\nGameplay is pretty simple. You're able to only move left and right on the screen and only shoot up. Bugs come out in swarms and you need to break them down to destroy them. i.e kill a large bug and it breaks into 2 medium bugs, shoot them and they each break into 2 small bugs etfc Allowing you to finally kill the small bugs to clear the screen. Naturally if you shoot anything that moves the entire screen fills up with bugs making it hard to move/attack. As the levels pile on you'll get a pretty good variety of environmental obstacles and enemies with their own individual movement patterns and shooting rhythms, health stats etc.\n\nThere is a fairly large amount of weapons that randomly appear in game to utilise (including different power ups as well - like freezing enemies for a few seconds etc). The game also puts in a combo system to help create higher scores and forcing you to make a kill every few seconds to keep the combo alive. It works really well for the most part as you start to learn how to juggle the kills in a certain way for better effect. Most of the time the screen will be filled up with plenty of enemies and it's beautiful chaos. There is a pretty great feeling when you pull off a large amount of kills in a couple of seconds with a combination of skill and pure luck.\n\nIn standard mode there are 30 levels in total. Doesn't sound like much but they are all pretty replayable if you are trying to 100% the game. The last level will give you a good run for your money as it forces you to juggle just about every weapon and skill in a well timed run. There is an additional co-op mode and another single player endless horde mode. All levels have global scores to see where you rank in the world. General game time to complete story mode would probably be under 4 hours (based on average difficulty), to 100% the game it took me about 5-6hrs. All achievements popped without any issues. While it would be nice to see additional levels, I've read the game hasn't sold well enough to break even/justify further development work. I feel there is easily enough content to justify the current asking price as it's quality over quantity (and it's under $10).\n\nIf you are purely in it for single player story mode and are not worried about achievements/co-op I'd probably recommend waiting for a sale. If you like to try 100% the game or have a buddy to play with then I'd recommend giving it a go. It's a fair price and It runs really well. There is no long loading times.

The Bug Butcher is a simple game, and what you see from the screenshots and trailer is exactly what you'll get. I blasted through the game in seven hours and enjoyed all of it, but probably wouldn't return for an extended session of mowing down bugs with laser gatlings.\n\nPros:\n+ Sleek and modern artstyle, dashing around is fun\n+ Slaughtering bugs feels satisfying, regardless of weaponry\n+ Reasonable amount of content - 30 campaign missions plus Endless\n+ Sense of progression via perks, weapon unlocks, etc\n+ Game runs well with keyboard or gamepad, I used the former\n+ Seriously, the Laser Gun. Good grief.\n\nCons:\n- Endless mode not as good as it could be, feels shallow\n- Local co-op not supported in campaign, only endless. Feels like an afterthought\n- Those purple blowhards that leap onto you for the instakill\n\nSome of the top ranks are fun to chase in the campaign, and the hard difficulty reduces you to one health point and a pair of boxers. Do you think Maximo might be moonlighting as an alien exterminator after his PS2 glory days?\n\nI'm nitpicking a bit with the drawbacks up there, because The Bug Butcher really is a fine example of a game that has a simple, addictive premise and executes it perfectly.

Laddove in Super Pang ci trovavamo a colpire palloni colorati, The Bug Butcher ci vede nei panni di una specie di impresa di disinfestazione alle prese con l'eradicazione di diverse tipologie di insetti spaziali varipinti. \n\nVi sono sostanzialmente due modalit\u00e0 di gioco: una modalit\u00e0 arcade, in cui affronteremo progressivamente 5 macro aree suddivise in 6 livelli ciascuno, e una modalit\u00e0 Panic, una sorta di endless mode in cui l'obiettivo principale sar\u00e0 quello di migliorare il proprio record di punteggio per scalare cos\u00ec la leaderbord. La modalit\u00e0 arcade permette di raccogliere monete che potranno essere impiegate per acquistare miglioramenti alle armi (partiamo con un'arma standard ma nell'arco del gioco troveremo casse contenenti mitragliatrici, laser, razzi e chi pi\u00f9 ne ha pi\u00f9 ne metta) o alle abilit\u00e0 speciali del nostro personaggio (invincibilit\u00e0, congelamento dei nemici, ecc.); nella modalit\u00e0 Panic invece armi addizionali e abilit\u00e0 speciali non verranno generati finch\u00e9 non saranno stati sbloccati, acquistandoli tra una wave di nemici e l'altra utilizzando il denaro a disposizione.\n\nIl gioco ha un gameplay molto fluido e veloce, che come ogni gioco di ispirazione neo-arcade richiede una buona dose di coordinazione e di reattivit\u00e0 - in particolare la presenza delle combo temporizzate richiede ad alti livelli una certa propensione al rischio che molto spesso finir\u00e0 col metterci nei guai. A differenza di Super Pang! per\u00f2 la maledetta \"morte al tocco\" \u00e8 stata eliminata, sostituita da una barra vitale che ci permetter\u00e0 di prendere qualche prioettile prima di passare a miglior vita.\n\nSe da un lato il gameplay \u00e8 veramente ottimo, dall'altro il comparto audio-video non \u00e8 sempre all'altezza. In particolare mi dispiace notare la superficialit\u00e0 dell'interfaccia utente (che ha il difetto aggiuntivo di essere pensata per la navigazione con il gamepad): non sono abituato a giudicare il libro dalla copertina, ma se avessi adottato questo approccio con The Bug Butcher probabilmente a quest'ora non starei scrivendo questa recensione positiva. Lo stile semi-cartoonesco generale funziona a met\u00e0, e questo perch\u00e8 modelli 2D e animazioni non sono sempre fluidi e ben realizzati.

It requires amazing skill to dodge all enemies even with maxed out abilities. Easy to learn, yet hard to master. That's this game in 1 sentence. One of the most amazing games I have met in a long time.\n\nAlthough there have been some things that really dissapointed me. I have lost all my progress and all my time and effort I put into this game. all upgrades I had: gone. All levels I had completed and all the stars I had gotten: gone. This really dissappointed me and almost made me hate this game. But after picking it up again, and working back to where I was, I saw the beauty of the game again. It's incredibly satisfying seeing the enemies 'explode'. If I had the time, I would watch enemies 'exploding' all day long.\n\nEvery enemy is different, moves in a different way, has certain abilities and you can predict all of their moves, almost nothing is random, and yet even with this in mind, the game makes it difficult for you. Yet you keep trying and trying again, untill you beat it. The enemy's come from different angles and move in different directions, keeping track off all of them and avoiding them can be near impossible. Weapon crates make this easier but you need to use them at the right time, just like with the abilities you get for hitting enemies, wrong timing can lead to death. The right timing can clear the entire level and allow you to breath.\n\nAn amazing game where skill, spatial awareness and timing are key to succes.\n\nYes, I did get it on 50% off, but did that change my decision? no!

Por\u00e9m com o decorrer dos n\u00edves, o jogo vai ficando acelerado, as fases v\u00e3o ficando mais e mais desafiadoras, voc\u00ea vai pegando o jeito e ele fica cada vez mais divertido.\n\nO que mais me agradou:\n\n- Visual: cartunizado, limpo, bem agrad\u00e1vel aos olhos. O layout dos menus, a atmosfera e os efeitos visuais dos powerups/armas s\u00e3o bonitos.\n\n- A\u00fadio: o som das armas e dos powerups ficaram grudados na minha cabe\u00e7a. Usar a metralhadora n\u00e3o \u00e9 a mais eficiente das armas, mas sem d\u00favidas \u00e9 a mais divertida por causa desse quesito a\u00ed..rs. A trilha sonora \u00e9 bem agitada em algumas fases, n\u00e3o enjoa e te d\u00e1 aquela empolga\u00e7\u00e3o extra pra realizar um combo daora. Poderiam disponibilizar a soundtrack na Steam, eu compraria.\n\n- Jogabilidade: os comandos s\u00e3o bem fluidos e at\u00e9 a posi\u00e7\u00e3o de jogar \u00e9 bem tranquila (A, D, ctrl direito, shift direito e barra de espa\u00e7o); n\u00e3o precisa ficar apertando e soltando o bot\u00e3o de tiro (\u00e9 s\u00f3 sentar o dedo e ser feliz);\n\n- Fator Replay: depois que voc\u00ea aprimora algo, vai querer dar uma repassada naquela fase porca que voc\u00ea passou s\u00f3 com uma estrela. Mais pra frente vai ficar curioso em querer fazer algumas conquistas e vai se divertir tentando fazer elas (ou passar raiva). Depois, vai querer tentar aquele combo x50 que n\u00e3o conseguiu e por a\u00ed vai.\n\nO que n\u00e3o curti muito:\n\n- Hist\u00f3ria: poderia ter sido melhor trabalhado. N\u00e3o \u00e9 ruim, mas ficou aquela sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de que ficou faltando alguma coisa no final.\n\n- Aus\u00eancia do modo multiplayer: ok, j\u00e1 adquiri sabendo que n\u00e3o teria esse modo, mas depois que voc\u00ea se diverte com o jogo, bate aquela decep\u00e7\u00e3o por n\u00e3o ter como jogar por esse modo (disappointed, but not surprised)\n\n- Alguns coisas bobas menores do tipo: voc\u00ea t\u00e1 l\u00e1 jogando, d\u00e1 um pause e clica pra voltar no bot\u00e3o errado, tcharam, volta pro menu sem confirma\u00e7\u00e3o nenhuma; o tutorial que no come\u00e7o n\u00e3o dava certo pra mim de jeito nenhum (por um erro de configura\u00e7\u00e3o j\u00e1 inicial do jogo), tive que voltar pro menu e ajeitar.\n\nNo geral, \u00f3timo jogo.

Data l'impossibilit\u00e0 di sparare a destra o a sinistra, gli insetti che ci troveremo a affrontare essenzialmente rimbalzano o saltano sullo schermo, permettendoci cos\u00ec di poterli friggere (che gentili X-D). Nei vari livelli che compongono il gioco \u00e8 possibile sfruttare bonus di vario genere (come ad esempio il ghiaccio, che letteralmente congela i nemici sullo schermo, o i missili, che partono in tutte le direzioni alla ricerca di bersagli) e armi, rendendo pi\u00f9 divertente e varia l'esperienza di gioco. Ovviamente, com'\u00e8 facile aspettarsi, man mano che si avanza nel gioco i mostri diventano sempre pi\u00f9 agguerriti e mortali, cos\u00ec come iniziano a comparire ostacoli di vario genere negli stage - presse pronte a schiacciarci, fiamme dalle pareti e muri di energia sono soltanto alcune delle cose che tenteranno di metterci i bastoni tra le ruote. Il gioco presenta varie modalit\u00e0 di gioco: la modalit\u00e0 standard, l'Arcade, suddivisa in 5 sezioni da 6 stage, durante la quale si guadagnano soldi per potenziare il proprio personaggio e si tenta di fare il punteggio pi\u00f9 alto possibile per scalare le classifiche (o guadagnare le stelle per gli achievements, raggiungendo determinati obiettivi di combo e punteggio negli stessi stage), e la modalit\u00e0 Panic, giocabile anche in cooperativa, dove si tenta di andare il pi\u00f9 avanti possibile affrontando ondate continue, anche qui guadagnando soldi per potenziare il proprio personaggio dopo ogni ondata.\n\n[b]PRO E CONTRO[/b] > Tanti, tantissimi pro. Il gioco \u00e8 fluido, veloce, animato benissimo, si controlla come dio comanda ed \u00e8 dannatamente divertente da giocare. Il gioco rende bene gi\u00e0 dai filmati qui su Steam, ma giocandoci ci si accorge di quanta cura sia stata riposta dietro al suo sviluppo. A tal proposito, peccato che sia praticamente sconosciuto ai pi\u00f9 - \u00e8 una di quelle classiche \"perle nascoste\" che fa sempre piacere scoprire. Se proprio si vuole cercare un contro, direi la lunghezza: gli stage in modalit\u00e0 Arcade si finiscono presto (specie se non puntate a fare le stelle), e la modalit\u00e0 Panic \u00e8 ripetitiva alla lunga senza qualcuno con cui giocare - io in meno di 7 ore ho ottenuto tutti gli achievements, e in questo tempo sono comprese anche alcune partite fatte in modalit\u00e0 Panic.

It's cheap anyway and only developed by a few people.\n\nBasically it's the evolution of space invaders, with interesting levels that make the game more challenging, as well as a variety of different enemies, which, combined, can really mess up your day.\n\nYou can only shoot up with your basic machine gun. Periodically the game will spawn power ups and weapon pick ups, like beam gun, lightning gun, health...you also gain a random power up after you've dealt enough carnage, like freeze all enemies, or become invulnerable, etc.\n\nAll of these can be upgraded in the \"campaign\" mode. There's also an arcade mode, which seems like an \"endless shooter\"? Dunno. You seem to be able to upgrade on the fly here.\n\nAnyway, nice little indie game from mobile. Could use a bit more content though, imho. Maybe different characters, some more levels and modes, etc. However, I think it is way too expensive for what it offers.

There\u2019s a market for these high-quality, retro-style titles \u2013 just look at our coverage over the last week, two of the main titles were Axel The Penguin and The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human. Fair enough, these aren\u2019t necessarily the first games the devs have created, but they are certainly ones that got them noticed. The Bug Butcher is one.\n\nThe Bug Butcher is a nice 2D game by Awfully Nice Studios with fluid animations, a fancy soundtrack, and a cartoon-themed art style, it follows the protagonist \u2013 \u201cHarry\u201d \u2013 as he embarks on an assignment to a planet know as Zolt, proving his worth as a bug destroying expert, The scientists on the planet hired him because their numbers are dropping\u2026 like flies;   and to kill the various bug monsters that are slaughtering them all, Harry must kill the bugs\u2026like flies.\n\nYour aim, kill all the bugs, collect all the coins, and save the scientists. Sounds like a nice little story, and fair enough, it\u2019s a nice little game! It boasts similarities to other games wherein the player can only fire upwards, just like Space Invaders, or a vertical version of R-Type.\n\nIt looks slightly like, Alien Hominid, remember that? The Bug Butcher seems very based on it, with similar art styles, similar interfaces, but with more modern, sleek graphics, and more bugs.\n\nRead the rest: http://bigbossbattle.com/review-the-bug-butcher/", "timestamp_created": 1465656431, "timestamp_updated": 1465656431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23360254": {"recommendationid": "23360254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065218470", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506083326}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like slimy disgusting rainbow powerup bugs that jump on your head in too many different ways in order to kill you, buy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1464956862, "timestamp_updated": 1464956862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.446927", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23295074": {"recommendationid": "23295074", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960524483", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464699004}, "language": "german", "review": "Great Game :D", "timestamp_created": 1464631293, "timestamp_updated": 1464631293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460705", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23242627": {"recommendationid": "23242627", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971767322", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464450243}, "language": "english", "review": "Repetitive...lasted 11 levels...and then fell asleep.

One look and you're thinking \"Castle Crashers with guns?\" that's about right. It has a similar feel but can't beat Castle Crashers (A+++). This was made to be a frantic heart-pounding game due to a deadly threat. Your immersion is based on reaction, timing and power. But the game just keeps breaking it's own rhythm with forced pauses and inability. A great looking game (Solid B) but loaded with petty gameplay flaws; Buy it on sale.\n\nTop 5 Cons=\nOne Hit Kills: The game is on easy. I have eight life. Why do we have monsters that kill me in one hit for no reason? In fact, most of my Cons are based on this kind of mob since I have such a limited way to fight them. Easy=/=instadeath.\n\nYou Can Only Shoot in One Direction (up): This is an intentional game design decision that is just painful and crippling. Being unable to shoot at angles or just in front of you breaks immersion; especially when you have a bug standing right next to you. Maybe they did it so you can't just laser the whole room? /shrug Sure... but they could have just made a limit to the laser range.\n\nBug Boys Can't Jump: When you have a bug standing right next to you while commanding the powers of Ice Gernades and a Laser imbued with pure deadly hellfire, but can't jump over an immobile bug that is in your way... /sigh... You get crippling immersion breaking again.\n\nNo Seemless Transition: You finish a \"room\". The score pops. Fade to black. Load the next \"room\" in the same \"room\". I should be running from room to room or never leave the same room since the background stays the same. The game shouldn't need to stop and reload for each level. Just have me walk into the next room on the same floor or signal to begin the next phase in the same room. My immersion ends with each \"room\" completion. Castle Crashers got this right with side scrolling, how did Bug Butcher get this wrong? \n\nUpgrades vs Difficulty vs The Timer: I should be able to keep my upgrades regardless of the difficulty. The difficulty should effect my cash rewards. I shouldn't be able to upgrade my weapon only twice depending on the difficulty. My timer should be based on my abilities to keep it balanced. All of these things were not made to work with each other. They are each a part of the whole, when they should be one whole organism with co-dependant organs.\n\nThe Good Stuff=\n5. The Art: Looks great but not enough of it. I just see the same fantastic background for too many rooms.  \n\n4. The Controls: Seemless reaction time and configureable layouts. The game fits to you, not the other way around.\n\n3. The Combat: This is where you fall in love with frantic heart-pounding. The power-ups and weapons were well thought out. Their balance give each weapon a personality rather than a weakness, Wanted to outrun bugs with normal movement though.\n\n2. The Animation: I dont feel like I'm seeing mobs. I feel like I'm seeing \"real\" bug/monster movement for their universe. In a way, this is so good it is bad. This gives you the most immersion (IMO).\n\n1. Epic Music.

It's a pretty classic game, the controls are really easy, it has a lot of progress (upgrading weapons, power ups and other things), lots of levels and is just really fun to play casually, just killing the damned bugs. Enemy variety is good, and they all have their unique attacks and movement patterns. The level design isn't what I'd call especially innovative, but they look very nice (and I have not finished the game yet, so there might be more coming). Part of this is due to the lack of platforming elements, so the room for innovation is actually pretty small.\n\nHardcore gamers get chances to optimize their scores and clear times. The enemy spawns in the levels are always the same, so that you can memorize them and optimize your play, gaining combos and higher scores.\n\nIf you don't do that, a first playthrough can be done in about 2-4 hours.\n\nTo round it up, there is an endless game mode, which I haven't delved into yet.\n\nAll in all I'd definitely recommend this game!", "timestamp_created": 1459117538,

You don't play Bug Butcher that way; you play Bug Butcher with the fire button held down, you shoot everything you can until there's nothing left, and you do it fast and loose and sometimes you take some damage (in Super Pang, you died in a single hit, which really changes the feel).  Both games have bouncing things, but deep-down they're very different games.\n\nBut anyway, yeah, Bug Butcher is a good action shooter; sometimes it feels like sort of a \"bullet hell platformer\" maybe?

You have to shoot the enemies that are bouncing around the room and the only direction you can shoot at is upwards. You play as The Butcher, who specialises in killing monsters in this exact same situation.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*][b]Gameplay[/b] | It's always nice to see when somebody makes a remake of an old classic game, but these remakes are usually just counting on player's nostalgia, instead of making a genuinely good game. Fortunately, this is not the case in The Bug Butcher. The gameplay is smooth and works as well as it should. It doesn't change the principle it's based on, but enhances it.\n    [*][b]Graphics[/b] | This game has a really nice colourful appearance that really makes this game stand out. I mean, just look at the Store page screenshots! All the effects look really nice, although they can get for a slight bit too confusing at times.\n    [*][b]Weapons[/b] | There are different weapons in this game and you can also get a lot of upgrades and pickups that boost your performance, for example faster shooting. Variety plays a really important role in this remake.\n    [*][b]Co-op[/b] | You can of course also play with your buddy, if you're having him in your home. There is also controller support, so you don't have to be cramped on the same keyboard.\n    [*][b]Pricing[/b] | For such a nice game, I don't think $8 is a lot. It has hours and hours of gameplay, Steam Achievements and Leaderboards.\n    [*][b]Stages[/b] | There are 30 story-based stages in different environments and there are also survival mission for both singleplayer and co-op modes. This is great if you want more fun after you completed the story missions.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*][b]Controller Chaos[/b] | So, this game sometimes doesn't really let me play with my keyboard. The controls in game are always appearing as controller buttons, but in the options menu, everything is shown as keyboard buttons. This can be sometimes very confusing.\n    [*][b]Learning Curve[/b] | Although this game is very easy to understand, it becomes too hard a little to quickly. But that is just my opinion.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The final verdict:[/h1]\nThis game is a really nice remake of old classic called Pang and it's really well-made. The graphics are awesome, there is even some story included. The confusion with controller/keyboard controls are the biggest problem in this game I see.\nFor its price, I think this game is definitely worth checking out as it offers quite a lot of fun.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\n[quote]Note that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

Cela a son importance pour appr\u00e9hender les niveaux et la destruction des ennemis.\nLes contr\u00f4les sont tr\u00e8s simples : trois boutons et deux directions. Sur une manette xbox, le X correspond au pouvoir sp\u00e9cial qui poss\u00e8de une jauge \u00e0 remplir en tuant des ennemis. Le A pour tirer (Autofire quand maintenu) et B pour le dash (tr\u00e8s utile dans certains cas).\nSur le plan graphique, le jeu est vraiment tr\u00e8s joli et mignon. Si j'avais un reproche, c'est le manque de grosses diff\u00e9rences entre les d\u00e9cors. Je pense aussi que la lisibilit\u00e9 est la priorit\u00e9 et pour \u00e7a, c'est gagn\u00e9. La direction artistique est r\u00e9ussie avec des ennemis au look tr\u00e8s cartoon.\n\n\nSur le plan gameplay, chaque monde a une particularit\u00e9 sauf le premier. Par exemple, des barri\u00e8res de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9, des plateformes, une presse,... Les ennemis sont tous diff\u00e9rents et ont une f\u00e2cheuse tendance \u00e0 se diviser quand on les d\u00e9truit. Une partie du plaisir vient de la d\u00e9couverte de ces magnifiques bestioles.\nPour faire la transition entre les niveaux, les d\u00e9veloppeurs ont ajout\u00e9 un niveau d'ascenseur qui, lui aussi, a ses petites particularit\u00e9s. Tout sauf reposant, ils peuvent \u00eatre assez retors.\n\nComme si cela ne suffisait pas, il faut aussi des pouvoirs pour rendre le jeu particuli\u00e8rement fr\u00e9n\u00e9tique parce que l'une des tr\u00e8s bonnes id\u00e9es est de pouvoir cumuler le pouvoir que l'on poss\u00e8de d\u00e9j\u00e0 par d\u00e9faut en tuant les ennemis avec ceux qui tombent sur le terrain (Idem que les ennemis, l'un des plaisirs reste de les d\u00e9couvrir) : Il suffit d'avoir la seringue d'adr\u00e9naline coupl\u00e9 \u00e0 un power up de vitesse pour avoir son personnage qui ressemble \u00e0 un speedy gonzales sous speed. Jouissif.\nPar contre, les pouvoirs sont limit\u00e9s par le temps ou l'utilisation (l'autofire n'\u00e9tant plus une bonne option dans ce cas).\n\nJ'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9 des ennemis diff\u00e9rents, du fait que l'on ne peut tirer qu'en l'air et pas de l'apparition des ennemis. Ils ne viennent pas tous du plafond pour faciliter la t\u00e2che. Ils peuvent venir du haut, des c\u00f4t\u00e9s et du bas. Tr\u00e8s vite, on comprend qu'il ne vaut mieux pas rester en dessous de la trappe en esp\u00e9rant \u00e9liminer une partie de la menace m\u00eame si le compteur de combo en d\u00e9pend.\nLe jeu a une dimension scoring avec une jauge de combos qui augmente \u00e0 chaque ennemi tu\u00e9, diminue progressivement entre deux morts et se r\u00e9initialise \u00e0 chaque fois que le personnage est touch\u00e9. De plus, les ennemis l\u00e2chent des pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 r\u00e9colter pour augmenter son score. A la fin de chaque niveau, il y a un tableau de score avec les points gagn\u00e9s et le meilleur combo \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser.\nPour motiver un peu plus le joueur, \u00e0 chaque fin de niveau, des pi\u00e8ces sont r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9s pour am\u00e9liorer son personnage : power up, arme de base et vitesse. C'est un petit plus sympa.\n\nPour finir et \u00eatre plus dans mon ressenti. C'est un jeu tr\u00e8s facile \u00e0 prendre en main avec une difficult\u00e9 progressive. Il est fun instantan\u00e9ment et addictif. Pour les amateurs de shmup ou ceux qui cherchent un petit jeu \u00e0 faire, c'est le candidat parfait.\n\nJe pr\u00e9cise que j'ai fini le mode arcade sans chercher le scoring. Le mode panique est tr\u00e8s fun en co-op tout comme en solo : En gros, c'est un mode sans fin o\u00f9 il faut tenir le plus longtemps possible et l'argent r\u00e9colt\u00e9 permet de prendre des upgrades.", "timestamp_created": 1455473892, "timestamp_updated": 1455473892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621678", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21203701": {"recommendationid": "21203701", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984975793", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457552306}, "language": "english", "review": "An easy buy.

Ohh yeah, it's bug Butcher time!\n\nIf you're a fan of shoot'em ups of games like electronic super joy, you're probably going to really enjoy this. There is a lot of action on the screen at times and while to the extent of something like Ikaruga, it does provide a welcome alternative to the space ship shooters without the need of a platform jumper.\n\nHowever, those looking for a class Pang remake may be a little disappointed at first, but surprisingly pleased by the out come. It gives a nice, faster, more up beat game play as well as a few new weapons to play with giving a refreshed feel, if you don't mind the missing ropes.\n\nGameplay wise, there isn't really much in the way of upgrades for the character. I think I managed to max out everything I could in the first few hours. The game has a nice tutorial to get you into the swing of things and you'll soon be awarded with new weapons to use and upgrade. \nAs you progress you've presented with new bugs to kill, each with their own abilities and things you need to watch out for and different means of dealing with them. Some rooms have different envo hazards you need to watch out for, or use to your own advantage.\n\nI've like to see Steam workshop support added, a basic level editor for community levels to make things interesting. Right now there is the fixed path of the single player mode, that once beat on hard (it is btw) you'll only be able to get higher scores againt world and friends. The alternatives are co op and the endless mode where you kill bugs for extra time pickups. You play until time runs out or you die.

Yes, this game is essentially a 90's arcade darling \"Pang\" with a fresh coat of paint. I used to love going out with my parents for dinner, because most pub restaurants around at the time had arcade machines. Pang was one of my favourites, because it was obvious just from looking at the screen what you had to do, so you needn't fear wasting your cherished pocket money just to learn the ropes.\n\nThe Bug Butcher takes the simplistic and enjoyable core gameplay of Pang and shakes it up just enough so that you wouldn't call it a clone, but you can tell from first glance that it is clearly paying homage. Actually, that isn't giving it enough credit, I would personally say that The Bug Butcher is superior in every way. It's faster paced, rarely feels unfair and has a much better aesthetic.\n\nRather than \"harpooning balls\", you play the roll of Harry, a badass bug exterminator, called into a laboratory that has become totally infested with giant mutant creepy crawlies. As Harry, you can only shoot directly upwards, which works out just fine because this is where the majority of critters come into his crosshairs. Most bugs either bounce off the floor over the top of you or fly around. Some will fire projectiles at you, while others will crawl along the roof and try to eat your scientist friends by snagging them on their long tongues. A lot of the chunkier bugs will split into smaller bugs after you've given them a good zapping, adding to the chaos.\n\nFortunately you rarely find yourself overwhelmed thanks to the wide range of weapons and power-ups available. These range from a high-speed rail gun to a freeze bomb that turns all bugs to ice for a few seconds. No matter what method you use to butcher bugs, each different weapon and power-up feels extremely satisfying, each packing a lot of power compared to your standard blaster which is itself still extremely punchy and enjoyable to use. This is probably down to a combination of audio-visual thump and some precise, responsive controls.\n\nEvery bug killed drops more coins for you to spend on passive bonuses that stay permanent throughout the 30 level main arcade campaign. These can increase your damage, power-up duration and increase your combo time. Personally, I always went with the 30% speed boost. The combo system allows you to rack up major points by slaughtering bugs in quick succession, the combo meter itself gets reset every time you take damage or don't land a kill after a couple of seconds. If you're aiming for a perfect rank on each level, you're going to have to get a perfect string of combos throughout the whole level. This becomes much easier when you play the levels again later after having invested coins into more firepower, but can be a source of frustration for the perfectionists when their combo breaks toward the end of the level.\n\nThere are two modes included with the game. The first is the Arcade mode, which puts you through 30 levels of increasing difficulty with a new environmental hazard introduced every 5 levels. These include things like floating platforms, laser walls, and a giant hammer that periodically smashes everything underneath. Completing a level will give you a score and a rank out of four stars. Three of these are awarded for reaching a certain score, while the fourth is awarded for a specific number of combos made. Unfortunately, these 30 levels will be over before you know it and leave you wanting more. There are also no boss bugs, despite what the trailer for the game claims. Although the difficulty curve seems to be highly polished, likely from player feedback while the game was in Early Access, I felt it didn't go far enough with the challenge.\n\nThe other game mode is called Panic, which will simply throw waves and waves of monsters at you until you are overwhelmed or run out of time. Time can be boosted in this mode, as bugs you've destroyed will frequently drop items that add more time to the counter. So far I've never come close to running out of time. I've found myself totally bombarded with bugs long before that happens. You can also buy power-ups and weapons in this mode from the pause menu, but they only last for the game you're currently in. There is also a two-player co-op version of Panic mode, where if one player dies the other player can revive them, but if just one of you perishes, then it's game over for you both. The multiplayer aspect shows a lot of promise, but it would be a lot better if there were perhaps larger maps for up to four players. It's also local co-op only, there's no online play here. Panic mode might seem like the answer to the lack of challenge on the Arcade mode, but you have to suffer through a lot of repetitive easy waves before the challenge starts to ramp up.\n\nThe graphics are sharp and colourful. Each type of bug has a truly unique design and are animated well. They also squish and burst in a way that feels immensely satisfying but doesn't gross you out. Add to that the sound effects which all feel base-like and appropriate for what's happening, from the sound of your gun, to the sticky squish noises of the bugs bouncing. Harry himself stands out well from the backgrounds and all the other objects flying around the stages. I never had an issue with knowing where I was or what dangerous thing was coming towards me. A combination of the camera tracking and Harry's character design, and his eccentric movement all helped. The game shows you in advance where bugs are going to appear from, giving you time to get out of the way if you're standing on a trap door where an insect eruption is imminent.\n\nAside from the bugs that are supposed to be there, I didn't encounter many problems with the game at all. I did experience a very irritating glitch on the final level of Arcade mode where no bugs were spawning on the final wave, while the background was flashing and glitching up, until I eventually ran out of time and had to repeat it. The UI for the menus is also a mess, with some buttons being labelled and others not. It was clearly designed for a touch-screen or mouse, yet the game itself is best played with a controller. Even without a controller plugged in, it will give you button prompts based on the Xbox controller layout. There are also no options to adjust basic video settings like resolution and refresh rate. The game will run at whatever your desktop resolution is set to, though this should be fine for most people (high refresh-rate displays also work just fine).\n\nThe Bug Butcher is a fantastic, highly polished arcade game that unfortunately feels a little barebones, like the framework for a highly re-playable and addictive game is in place, but needs fleshing out to realise its full potential. However, it's well worth the $8 asking price, especially if you have a friend you can do some couch co-op with. Really, the only major gripe I have with this game is that I want more.", "timestamp_created": 1454953547, "timestamp_updated": 1479969555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.726480", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21055802": {"recommendationid": "21055802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044839188", "num_games_owned": 1715, "num_reviews": 174, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480388313}, "language": "polish", "review": "https://youtu.be/8KAiGBVNutI\n\nhttp://www.gikz.pl/artykuly/luzne-gadki-gry/the-bug-butcher-robactwu-na-pohybel/\n\nZgniatacz Robali wywo\u0142a\u0142 niema\u0142e poruszenie, kiedy gdzie\u015b na gikzie zwiastun zosta\u0142 podwieszony.

You are Harry, a brash and tenacious exterminator who has a knack for decimating bugs. [/i]\n\n[h1]What I noticed at a first glance:[/h1]\n[list][*]The controls are very tight and are simple enough for new players and complex enough for those who wish to go more in depth.\n[*]It\u2019s a 2D, side scrolling game with a twist: instead of shooting across the screen at enemies, you shoot vertically. \n[*]Unforgiving difficulty that punishes you when you mess up. Not unfair; if you die, it was most certainly your fault.\n[*]The power-ups. There is a great variety of these, ranging from increased damage, attack speed, and freezing enemies. There are also weapons that can spawn in crates, each with its own advantages.\n[*]Tons of available upgrades to increase different stats and perks.\nImpressive soundtrack and sound design in general. Electronic, sci-fi music mixed with the pew pew pew of your laser gun.\n[*]There are 3 game modes. Arcade missions act as a campaign mode with 30 levels. There is a set amount of time/waves of enemies that spawn. Panic (singleplayer) is a sungleplayer survival mode and Panic (co-op) is survival with local co-op enabled.\n[*]Enemies varies depending on level. Each has their own attack patterns, which easy to learn, making them somewhat predictable (and killable)\n[*]Cartoony, light-hearted art style that makes pest control in space seem more appealing then you ever thought it could be.\t\n[*]Levels are confined to a small space. I would enjoy a more open, free game mode where exploration was mixed with alien pest control. This may just be me, but I really enjoy games with certain aspects of freedom that allow the player to create his/her own unique experience.\n[*]Replay value to get achievements and beat your old scores.[/list]\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nI was impressed with the quality of this game. The controls are tight and the difficulty is unforgiving. If you have any interest in arcade shooters or games with big guns and lasers, I would highly recommend you at least check out the demo. \n\n[h1]My implemented rating system:[/h1]\n[strike]Run away! 1-2/10\nHandle with caution\u2026 3-4/10\nBuy on sale: 5-6/10[/strike]\n[h1]Every day purchase: 7-8/10[/h1]\n[strike]Must buy: 9-10/10[/strike]\n\n[h1]This game\u2019s rating: 7.5/10.

They look slick, but elements break apart and hidden elements are shown when scaled wider than 16:9. The menus support keyboard/mouse/controller, but it seems like a mashup of shortcuts that work well on some and not on others. It\u2019s really quite a mess beyond the first glance, and while none of this effects the gameplay, it does cause resetting the level to be a pain depending on your input method. A Keyboard-only level reset takes 13 inputs... There's plenty of room for a reset key; it would alleviate a ton of the frustration during the more difficult stages.\n\nKey rebinding is present but isn\u2019t complete, and controller is limited to one default mapping which I don\u2019t find to be all that optimal. I opted for the keyboard for all of my play at the end of the game, as the default mapping played well, and was the most responsive considering the movement is digital rather than analog. Local Co-op is playable with a a single keyboard and/or controllers. Co-op keyboard defaults make little sense, but can be rebound separately from the singleplayer controls.\n\nThe game supports at least 144hz and forces v-sync. However, the camera and walking enemies update position matching the refresh, while the bouncing enemies update around 60hz and will appear to stutter.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe core gameplay across all modes entails walking along the floor, dashing, and firing directly upwards, as bugs crawl out of every surface. It's similar to a traditional arcade shooter (Galaga / Space Invaders) but the dash and variety of enemy movements/attacks make it quite unique. Each bug is color-coded, contrasting strongly with the background environments. This is key as their movement, attack, and self-replication patterns are consistent; reading them becomes essential when trying to perfect a level. None of the bugs actively seek you out in any way; you position yourself to avoid collisions and line up attacks. You can use your dash to put yourself in the way of danger to kill faster; you\u2019re rewarded for that risk. Dashing won\u2019t trigger while holding the fire button, so you can\u2019t be sloppy with your inputs.\n\nThe main single-player mode consists of 30 levels across 5 areas, each with score targets for 1-3 star ratings and a target combo, achieved by killing bugs in succession before the 4 (6 w/ perk) second timer ticks down and without getting hit. The difficulty options simply adjust your maximum health, allowing you to take 1, 4, or 8 hits before death. You can survive through the 30 levels pretty quickly without too much trouble, but he challenge is meeting the score and combo-count requirements for each stage. While the difficulty setting has no impact on score, taking all of those hits and losing your combo each time will likely see you falling short of those goals. Losing the combo once in the middle of the stage could cut your final score by more than half, and leave your maximum combo under the target, as it\u2019s usually seems tailored to 50-80% of the spawned bugs.\n\nAll of the bug spawns are orchestrated; you can memorize the patterns and will likely need to when perfecting the final few levels. I believe power-ups and weapons are dropped from specific enemies, but the actual item you get is randomized. There are coins to collect, and while they add slowly to your score, their intended use is buying upgrades to the weapons and power-ups, as well as 3 perks. Again, because of the score-attack focus, I don\u2019t see why there is any progression system at all, though you\u2019ll have the money for every unlock before you finish a single run through. It becomes irrelevant before you go back to complete all the score and combo targets. A better use for the coins in my mind would have been costumes for the player character; still something to unlock and look forward to, without putting you at an immediate disadvantage.\n\nPanic, the only other mode at the moment, is an endless score attack and is playable with one or two players locally on the 5 maps. Players can revive each-other by spamming the A button over their body during a small window after they\u2019re downed. The coins here are accumulated during the run, are reset upon death, and can be spent in the pause menu to enable all of the power-ups and passive buffs from the singleplayer. A deploy-able bubble shield is also added to the roster of power-ups. There are no achievements or unlocks tied to this mode, but kills during do contribute to the achievements, and it was good fun with a friend. A local VS mode was shown off a while back, but doesn\u2019t exist in the current build.\n\nOverall it's very tight and satisfying, but there will be certain moments where you feel cheated. I came across instances of glitches and inconsistencies that forced a reset. It\u2019s all somewhat excusable, until it happens in the run you were nailing, ruining it and and frustrating the experience. Questionable choices involving components in the levels that can redirect enemies unexpectedly, bug out and block shots, or even kill you directly. Certain power-ups can also cause certain bugs to spaz out in unpredictable ways. It\u2019s largely a fair and rewarding challenge, but when those conflicts can get to you. It's minor and only really appears in the end-game, but still something to be worked on.\n\n[h1]Presentation[/h1]\n\nA mix of Jetpack Joyride, Castle Crashers, and Awesomenauts, the visual aesthetic is exceptional. There\u2019s a small amount of aliasing on some of the assets, but it\u2019s largely crisp and defined, with excellent color choice. The bug designs, while nothing iconic, all have a goofy charm and wear bright colors that both assist in gameplay and look great. In hectic scenes, you\u2019ll have many colors going at once, yet it remains unified because of the contrasting but not clashing color choices. The core sound effects are well defined, but the thumping electronic music was hit or miss for me.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThe Bug Butcher is a satisfying and unique 2D arcade shooter, where speed and precision are heavily rewarded. It\u2019s charming, vibrant 2.5D cartoon aesthetic is very appealing but also helps keep hectic situations readable. While relatively light on content, it\u2019s score attack format and achievements had me enjoying myself all the way to 100% completion in around 8 hours of play, with only a small amount of frustration perfecting the final few levels, stemming from small glitches or inconsistencies. The menu UI needs some work and though the port is nowhere near top-notch, it\u2019s good enough to be enjoyable on ultra-wide and high refreshrate displays. Co-op functionality for the 30 main missions, additional modes in general, and small enhancements like visual character customization would be greatly appreciated if development continues.

You have a time limit for each stage, from 2-3 minutes and if you haven't killed the aliens before the timer\nruns out you lose.\nThere are also scientists that if killed you lose. Only Spiders can kill them though.\nThere are a powerup that can freeze the timer and enemies, called a Freeze Grenade.\n\nYou have a Machine gun as standard weapon, but you can find pickup weapons on the ground that randomly spawns.\nYou also have powerups you can use after you have charged your powerup meter by killing the bugs.\n\nYou can run from side to side and dash.\nYou only shoot vertical upwards.\n\nSometimes tactics are a good thing to have, like if you have a Freeze Grenade or Homing Missiles,\nuse it while there are tons of enemies on the screen or if you need to buy more time.\n\nThere are 30 stages split up in 5 maps. Each time you change map you are in an elevator and you face enemies on your way up.\nThere are new enemies in the elevator so you have some knowledge about what you can face in the next map.\n\nThere are lots of different types of bugs like; small fireball bugs, Huge bugs that splits to smaller bugs when killed,\nsome kills you in one hit if the land on your head, ect.\nThe game is so much fun, the controls are smooth and the music fits so well to the game.\n\nI think there is a tiny bug, when you choose any of the game modes that it shows the controller buttons on the upgrade menu, insted of keyboard keys\n\nThe game would fit as a Mobile/Tablet game too due to the simple gameplay and controls.\n\n[h1]Game Modes: [/h1]\nArcade is the story mode of the game, with 30 stages split into 5 maps.\nPanic is Survival.

I recommend playing it either on Medium or Hard, which is pretty decent to play. Panic Mode is awesome, waves and waves of enemies, trying to kill you.

Up to 2 players, on 1 keyboard, just like old times, no need for a second keyboard or controller.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n- Good old times\n- Simple but fun concept\n- Positively Addicting\n- Co-op\n- Upgrade System\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n- Co-op only 2 players\n\n[b]Rating[/b]\n8.5/10\nIt's simple, small and reminds me of good old times. Addicting and fun for hours.\n\n[b]Recommended?[/b]\nYes, I highly recommend it. For this price you've got a new fun game, which will be fun for hours and hours. Even with the Leaderboards, you can always show off to your friends. Try playing it with a friend together, it would be even more fun then!\nVery well done and a big thumbs-up for the developers of this great game!", "timestamp_created": 1454598369, "timestamp_updated": 1479938052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482393", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20940700": {"recommendationid": "20940700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028614667", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 4227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510923990}, "language": "french", "review": "excellentissime!", "timestamp_created": 1454540170, "timestamp_updated": 1454540170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20939519": {"recommendationid": "20939519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065971311", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455289297}, "language": "english", "review": "[u][b]The Bug Butcher[/b][/u] is a fast paced shooter made by Awfully Nice Studios.\n\nPros\n+ Amazing Sountrack\n+ Amazing gameplay\n+ Achievements\n+ Full controller support\n+ Friendly and Cute Graphics\n+ Interesting upgradable hero\n\nCons\n- Game is more for controllers than keyboard\n- Only local Co-op", "timestamp_created": 1454535213, "timestamp_updated": 1454535223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519226", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20915810": {"recommendationid": "20915810", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997378919", "num_games_owned": 588, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462069830}, "language": "english", "review": "The Bug Butcher is a nice surprise to find on Steam.

Resumindo a ideia, um jogo de plataforma, onde voc\u00ea anda s\u00f3 para os dois lados e atira para cima.\n\nParece f\u00e1cil ou desinteressante? Que nada! A ideia \u00e9 basicamente essa sobre sua mec\u00e2nica: simples de entender, por\u00e9m dif\u00edcil de se dominar. E acima de tudo, extremamente divertida e intensa.\n\nTrazendo dois modos de jogo, e a op\u00e7\u00e3o de cooperativo para 2 jogadores locais num deles, The Bug Butcher \u00e9 um bel\u00edssimo sucessor espiritual, ressuscitando a simplicidade de um jogo antigo numa bel\u00edssima execu\u00e7\u00e3o art\u00edstica.\n\nVoc\u00ea assumir\u00e1 o papel de Harry, um famoso exterminador mais conhecido pela alcunha de o a\u00e7ougueiro, que \u00e9 chamado para livrar um laborat\u00f3rio de pesquisa de uma terr\u00edvel infesta\u00e7\u00e3o de insetos.\n\nA campanha do jogo, bem curtinha, \u00e9 chamada de modo Arcade, onde o jogador enfrentar\u00e1 30 miss\u00f5es em sequ\u00eancia, divididas em 5 mapas diferentes. A sexta miss\u00e3o de cada mapa se passa num elevador, que d\u00e1 acesso ao pr\u00f3ximo mapa.\n\nA hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 praticamente inexistente, com um pequeno tutorial de come\u00e7o que ir\u00e1 ensinar o b\u00e1sico do jogo, introduzir o anti-her\u00f3i e o contexto em que o jogo se passa.\n\nNo modo Arcade existem progress\u00f5es permanentes: a cada fase, o jogador acumular\u00e1 moedas, seja matando inimigos e coletando-as, ou cumprindo as 4 metas de cada fase para receber um dinheiro adicional. Com esse dinheiro, ser\u00e1 poss\u00edvel comprar armas, powerups e perks. Cada arma e powerup possui uma fase m\u00ednima para ser destrancado, e tamb\u00e9m permitir\u00e3o que se gaste dinheiro adicional para melhor\u00e1-los.\n\nJ\u00e1 o modo Panic, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 nenhuma progress\u00e3o permanente. \u00c9 basicamente um modo survival, onde o jogador dever\u00e1 aguentar o m\u00e1ximo de tempo vivo. Voc\u00ea ainda acumular\u00e1 moedas durante a partida, e poder\u00e1 sim comprar armas, powerups e perks da mesma forma. Por\u00e9m, ao final da partida, tudo vai embora, como em um jogo roguelike.\n\nEm ambos os modos de jogo, sua pontua\u00e7\u00e3o da fase ser\u00e1 salva, e o jogo automaticamente ir\u00e1 te colocar no placar global. O jogo tamb\u00e9m automaticamente ir\u00e1 colocar sua pontua\u00e7\u00e3o contra a de seus amigos, incitando assim uma boa competi\u00e7\u00e3o amig\u00e1vel.\n\nO jogo conta com 5 armas, sendo uma acess\u00edvel o tempo todo, e o restante delas tempor\u00e1rias, necessitando de serem pegas nas fases para serem usadas, e tendo muni\u00e7\u00e3o limitada para limitar o seu uso num intervalo de tempo.\n\nOs powerups s\u00e3o poderosas habilidades ativas, que exigem que a barra de powerup seja carregada antes de us\u00e1-los. Caso voc\u00ea possua m\u00faltiplos powerups liberados, o jogo far\u00e1 uma rota\u00e7\u00e3o a cada uso, sendo imposs\u00edvel escolher usar o que se quer.\n\nPor fim, Perks s\u00e3o habilidades passivas que melhorar\u00e3o a efici\u00eancia do personagem como um todo. Voc\u00ea poder\u00e1 ter todas, mas s\u00f3 uma delas poder\u00e1 ficar ativa por vez no modo Arcade.\n\nApesar de ser um jogo de plataforma, tanto a mobilidade do personagem quanto o combate s\u00e3o bem diferentes do usual. Pra come\u00e7ar, voc\u00ea s\u00f3 deslocar\u00e1 para esquerda e direita, utilizando as teclas A e D. Para aumentar a mobilidade temporariamente, voc\u00ea poder\u00e1 segurar a tecla CTRL, que far\u00e1 o personagem deslizar rapidamente, gastando sua barra de estamina, que se recupera bem r\u00e1pido.\n\nO layout das fases tamb\u00e9m costuma ser bem simples: uma tela limitada, onde voc\u00ea passar\u00e1 todo o tempo da fase nela. Os inimigos surgem em levas, com um indicador visual de onde v\u00e3o aparecer.\n\nAlgumas fases possuem recursos \u00fanicos em seu layout: barreiras verticais que ir\u00e3o limitar a movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o dos inimigos e a sua, ou barreiras horizontais que ir\u00e3o atrapalhar seus tiros e interferir na movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o inimiga, chamadas m\u00f3veis nas paredes, ou mesmo um mecanismo que poder\u00e1 te esmagar toda hora.\n\nE como faz para atirar? Oras, a tecla SHIFT. Com um pequeno detalhe: voc\u00ea atirar\u00e1 para cima, em linha reta. Obrigatoriamente. Dessa forma, voc\u00ea dever\u00e1 ficar abaixo dos inimigos para atirar neles. O desafio portanto \u00e9 reconhecer os padr\u00f5es de movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e ataque dos inimigos, se posicionar bem, e mandar bala.\n\nAo matar v\u00e1rios inimigos, voc\u00ea encher\u00e1 sua barra de Powerup, que poder\u00e1 ser usado com a tecla Espa\u00e7o. Os efeitos de Powerups costumam ser muito fortes, mas duram bem pouco.\n\nOs gr\u00e1ficos do jogo s\u00e3o muito belos: apesar de ser um 2D um tanto cartunesco, todos os personagens s\u00e3o desenhados a m\u00e3o, e compensam em riqueza nas anima\u00e7\u00f5es. O grande destaque visual do jogo fica certamente por conta das anima\u00e7\u00f5es de morte: dependendo da forma que voc\u00ea morre, \u00e9 uma anima\u00e7\u00e3o diferente que acontece!\n\nA interface nas partidas \u00e9 bem limpa e espa\u00e7ada, fornecendo um bom indicador de tudo que voc\u00ea precisa saber, sem atrapalhar nem um pouco. Infelizmente, cometeram um s\u00e9rio deslize nos menus do jogo, que parecem ser otimizados para touch em sua maioria, e somado \u00e0 falta de op\u00e7\u00f5es gr\u00e1ficas, fazem o jogo perder pontos pelo desleixo.\n\nOutra surpresa no jogo \u00e9 sua trilha sonora, de n\u00edvel profissional: ao todo s\u00e3o 10 m\u00fasicas, que casam bem com a ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o futurista do jogo, e contribuem para o clima psicod\u00e9lico, e ainda por cima, auxiliam na concentra\u00e7\u00e3o!\n\nOs sons s\u00e3o curtos e simples em sua maioria, ficando como fundo em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 trilha sonora. A \u00fanica exce\u00e7\u00e3o talvez sejam as vozes dos personagens, que s\u00e3o engra\u00e7adas e sem forma definida. O resultado \u00e9 um todo bem harm\u00f4nico, extremamente agrad\u00e1vel, divertido e nada cansativo.\n\nEmbora n\u00e3o haja campanha cooperativa, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel jogar o modo Panic em dois jogadores locais. Naturalmente, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 drop-in, o que n\u00e3o prejudica nada, pelo fato das partidas serem curtas e a pontua\u00e7\u00e3o separada. O dinheiro ganho, a pontua\u00e7\u00e3o e os upgrades s\u00e3o os mesmos para ambos os jogadores.\n\nA din\u00e2mica do jogo \u00e9 praticamente a mesma, exceto que quando um jogador morre, o outro jogador pode reviv\u00ea-lo. E caso um dos jogadores morra e n\u00e3o seja revivido a tempo, a fase ser\u00e1 perdida.\n\nVou ser sincero: eu nunca joguei o Super Pang/Super Buster Bros, cl\u00e1ssico em que este jogo se baseia, e certamente fiquei com um preconceito de sua simplicidade a princ\u00edpio, especialmente por adorar mec\u00e2nica complexas...\n\nPor\u00e9m, o jogo rapidamente me conquistou, pela sua velocidade e intensidade, que me dava uma dose de adrenalina constante, e ao mesmo tempo, o excesso de padr\u00f5es nas mec\u00e2nicas dos inimigos, que me fazia analisar tudo como um quebra-cabe\u00e7a vivo.\n\nAs fases s\u00e3o curtinhas, ent\u00e3o todo esse envolvimento que o jogo demanda n\u00e3o cansa. E claro, ver que a cada fase voc\u00ea melhora, ao ponto de subir na leaderboard gradativamente ao repetir uma mesma fase, \u00e9 extremamente recompensador!\n\nN\u00e3o posso deixar de novamente elogiar a arte no jogo, que tanto visualmente quanto sonoramente, estimulam mais ainda a jogatina. At\u00e9 morrer fica divertido, com tanta anima\u00e7\u00e3o diferente (e bem feita) nas mortes!", "timestamp_created": 1454115210, "timestamp_updated": 1454115210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632128", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20820298": {"recommendationid": "20820298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121682287", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477380762}, "language": "english", "review": "This game...AMAZING.

I have to say, this game's art and animation are very well done and in general it has a lot of polish.  I was happy to see that it had co-op and played with a friend which was a major selling point for me.  \n\nI had about 30 minutes of fun in co-op but the fun dried up quickly.  Mainly because I found the upgrade system to be not very well thought out.  The choices are not very strategic since the weapons drop at random, and the more upgrades you buy the less you know what will drop.  You cannot buy more then one shield (you should be able to but with increased cost) and some of the upgrades are confusing like the \"extra health\".  \n\nAlso, why can't you play the normal levels 2 player?

I think this is classic...but, if u just shoot ur enemy without powerup or special it's like something normally.. and this game have it. This game have both of power up and special. This is something i like. Makes me not bored. Every wave the monster/enemy we face growing stronger or there is different monster every wave with different style.\n\n[h1]Art[/h1]\n\nI would like to say this art so good. It's like\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n\nAlright this game have awesome soundtrack during the game... i was enjoying this soundtrack so much. But i must say if there is a real voice in every dialogue it would be good. In dialogue we just hear them say something like robot...its okay actually...but the human says like robot? hmmm....thats the cons i think.. but for overall its good.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\nThis game is pretty good if you like shoot em up genre.

modalit\u00e0 principale, l\u2019arcade, colmata seppur marginalmente dalla Panic in singolo e coop che aggiunge un paio d\u2019ore all\u2019esperienza che definiamo soddisfacente in rapporto al prezzo di lancio piuttosto basso, ovvero 7,99\u20ac su Steam.\nSe volete rilassarvi e scaricare la tensione o lo stress accumulati nel corso della giornata e non avete intenzione di spendere molto,

The Bug Butcher however does the genre proud, with its twitch gameplay doing its best to bring out the strengths of the genre. Great visuals complement action that forces you to keep shooting and killing, but being smart about it and not being reckless. While the game could use a little bit more variety for the long haul, what's there is extremely polished. Great performance plus loading times that are practically non-existent help in getting you right back in the action and keeping you there. It's a genre that gets to the basics, and The Bug Butcher is no exception to that. But small smart decisions regarding the gameplay helps make a game that kept me entertained throughout me playing it, and well worth the price point in question. Definitely a worthy successor in the genre, updated for the new age. \n\n[b]  Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-8_5-Suh28[/b]\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]+:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Tight twitch gameplay that keeps the action going. Takes me back to the old arcade days. \n[*] Solid controls that give you the right amount of control, and can allow you to be reckless and deal damage to yourself. That may sound weird to say, but part of the appeal of these games is the twitch gameplay, and consequences.\n[*] Strong aesthetic that complements gameplay. Great use of color choice to make action clear for the player.\n[*] Great performance, and minimal load times. How an arcade game should play.\n[*] Like the gravity mechanics with enemies and hitting them with your gun. It increases the skill ceiling especially with the combo multiplier. \n[*] Honestly, the game is probably under priced, even at it's full price. Feel like for the experience, you get your money's worth and then some. \n[/list]\n\n[b]-:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Do wish there was a little bit more variety in the long run. A couple more weapons, levels, and enemy types would have done wonders.\n[*] Feel like the upgrade system doesn't really do much other then add a bulletpoint feature to the game. Very basic. \n[*] I really can't put my finger on it, but something feels missing with the sound design. I didn't see a real difference in gameplay when turning the sound off, which is unusual for games like this. But I can't say WHAT is missing. \n[/list]\n", "timestamp_created": 1453305680, "timestamp_updated": 1453305680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705678", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20641435": {"recommendationid": "20641435", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991710428", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441917429}, "language": "english", "review": "yes!!! finally a pang! game with a fresh take and challenging gameplay. animations are super cute and graphics easy on the eye. its a great game for a few minutes of intense action every now and then", "timestamp_created": 1453295693, "timestamp_updated": 1453295693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20641353": {"recommendationid": "20641353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105908957", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499429992}, "language": "french", "review": "Tr\u00e8s sympa et facile \u00e0 prendree en main !", "timestamp_created": 1453295305, "timestamp_updated": 1453295305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20637070": {"recommendationid": "20637070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257721967", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453267180}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome visuals, good music, fun gameplay, Dont be a nerd......", "timestamp_created": 1453269319, "timestamp_updated": 1453269319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20636102": {"recommendationid": "20636102", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020711671", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453861456}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really good.

But to my great pleasure this game is FANTASTIC.\n\nGraphically the game looks handrawn reminds me of games like Critter Crunch with the 2D art work, the bugs splatter, the blaster/power up effects look good, and the bugs themselves look really good for what it all is.\n\nGameplay wise it's fairly simple but challenging, the bugs bounce up and down across the screen and you're character runs across the same screen only allowed to vertically (up), now on paper this sounds fairly boring and standard, but when you consider other elements like; creatures breaking into smaller variations of themselves, some creatures shooting little beams that could hurt you, stage hazards and more, it adds variety and challenge to the gameplay all while you're trying to keep a combo meter and your high score rising in order to reach individual goals in each level.\n\nIt seems pretty simple but as i went on and was pushed to increase my combos and score I found myself becoming more agile and offensive in my appoarch against these bugs, as opposed to waiting for them to bounce and go on killing them, more often than not i would rush them before they even hit the ground once.\n\nThe audio in the solid as expected, the musical score isn't anything too blaring or annoying, and usually i'm too focused on keeping my combos up to really care about the music.\n\nFinally the replayablity in this game is actually quite excellent, mroe often than not I found myself repeating levels to hit each of the goals with in the levels, and even switching to a harder mode to challenge myself...I failed to mention this earlier but I actually enjoy how the harder mode mixes up the enemy spawns as opposed to just being the same as the lower modes with more enemies.\n\nAll in all, I love this game, the moment I played the demo, closed it out, and kept coming back to it over and over again, I knew I had to buy it, I reccomend that you do the same :)", "timestamp_created": 1453233947, "timestamp_updated": 1453233947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508245", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20629529": {"recommendationid": "20629529", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966801020", "num_games_owned": 559, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462037075}, "language": "english", "review": "Improves very nicely on top of the \"Pang\"-style of gameplay.

Vicioso y de elevadas dificultades de niveles conforme progresas.\n\n[h1]Simp\u00e1tico y con muchos bugs por acabar...[/h1]\n\nNo esperaba que mis expectativas sobre este juego fueran demasiado buenas, y es que, The Big Butcher, es uno de los mejores [b]Early Access[/b] que he probado (por ahora) de lo que le resta del a\u00f1o. El juego en s\u00ed no tiene una historia, pero s\u00ed una serie de niveles en las que tendr\u00e1s que matar a diferentes \u00abbichos\u00bb de todos los colores en unas salas espaciales con tu Machine Gun, pero antes de entregarnos a la muerte de estos bichos, podemos pasar un peque\u00f1ito y casi nulo tutorial en la que se nos presentar\u00e1 el juego fuera del planeta Tierra y en la que nuestro protagonista desciende de su nave espacial y aterriza en la base en la que se encuentra instalado.\n\nNo es un juego complicado, por lo mucho puedes hacerte bolas con los controles (s\u00ed, debo mencionar aqu\u00ed que el juego no est\u00e1 traducido al espa\u00f1ol) y que sus mec\u00e1nicas son muy similares a cualquier juego de disparos. Puede que te traiga en tu banco de tu memoria [b]Metal Slug[/b], puesto que es m\u00e1s o menos as\u00ed el juego: disparar a tus enemigos y avanzar horizontalmente dentro de un escenario, en este caso, en un tipo de bunker en la que salen los bichos por doquier. Y en la que podemos ganar moneditas para poder potenciar los ataques de nuestras armas en todo momento, \u00bfqu\u00e9 padre, no? Sin embargo, al ser un Acceso Anticipado se te bloquean muchas cosas. Hay como un tipo de niveles que no se encuentran abierto al p\u00fablico en general. L\u00e1stima, tendr\u00e1s que conformarte con el desbloqueo de niveles conformes avances, pero s\u00f3lo hasta ah\u00ed.\n\nEn el aspecto gr\u00e1fico es algo que maravillar\u00e1 a muchos, pues su estilo visual es muy hermoso que me hacen estar jugando un tipo de comic (aunque no es el caso) lo digo por el tipo de tonalidades que tiene el propio juego. Cuando pruebas el tutorial puedes notar como la tempestad de la nieve es sumamente impresionante. Ojal\u00e1 pudiera matar a los bugs ah\u00ed a fuera...\n\nPor \u00faltimo, el sonido, \u00a1quiero la BSO! Son bastantes buenos los tracks que tienen de fondo, no dudo que en un futuro muy cercano pongan a disposici\u00f3n del p\u00fablico el soundtrack del juego, ya que los sonidos muy \u00abelectr\u00f3nicos\u00bb se ajustan perfecto para este tipo de juegos.

There are external problems and minor annoyances (menu isn't that user friendly with a controller) that would prevent me from recommending this game. However looking past these problems and only considering the quality of the game itself (in particular the graphics and the gameplay), I can do nothing else than recommend this game.\n\nIt's a very beautiful game, it runs smooth and the animations are great. I haven't had any performance isssues and it runs at a smooth 60 fps. The core gameplay is very solid. It's a vertical shooter where you have to defeat wave of increasingly harder (and different) enemies. It's easy to get in a great flow and there is enough of a challenge to keep you entertained.\n\nSo why is it really hard to recommend this game? The developers say the game has 30 levels (although only 18 are available in Early Access) and though it's technically accurate, it isn't really true. The real levels are called floors, of which there are only five. This results in very repetitive environments. The things the developer calls levels is just increasing the number of enemies (or adding another type) after a series of waves (four or five waves per level). This means there is a severe lack in content. In Early Access this is even worse.\n\nA lack of content doesn't have to be a bad thing (if the quality is good, which is the case), but the game has to be priced accordingly. This however isn't the case. The price of the game is way too high. The developer even says they plan to increase the price of the game after Early Access. This would be a grave mistake. Even with the planned features it simply isn't worth \u20ac 9,99, not even by a long shot. This is a game that shouldn't be priced above \u20ac 4,99. I wouldn't even consider buying the game at \u20ac 9,99. If by mistake I did buy it, I would have asked for a refund based on the lack of content. I don't think I'm alone in this and the developers should really consider this. It would be a real shame this game would fail, because the developer didn't understand the value of the game. It shouldn't fail based on quality, but it will fail if the price isn't lowered. \n\nTLDR: \n\n- Should you buy the game in Early Access: No\n- Should you buy the game for \u20ac 9,99: No\n- Is the game worth playing: Yes\n- Should you buy the game if has a lower price (\u20ac4,99 or below): Yes\n\nFULL DISCLOSURE: I have recieved this game for free from the developer.", "timestamp_created": 1443254855, "timestamp_updated": 1443254855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503445", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18197718": {"recommendationid": "18197718", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980238206", "num_games_owned": 1252, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461562472}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u043d\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044c! \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0437\u044b\u0433\u0440\u044b\u0448 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043c!", "timestamp_created": 1443251807, "timestamp_updated": 1443251807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18197147": {"recommendationid": "18197147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091442678", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443322359}, "language": "english", "review": "the game is very funny and it's have familiar but still unique gameplay :v. it's a very good game for you when you need to relax (shoot up the bug feel quite good :))))) or have some challenge time.

Bug Butcher you take on a role of Harry, a intergalactical mercenary bug exterminator who has been given a task on planet Zoit to deal with an bug infestation in a research compound. You must clear the research lab of bugs in order to keep the scientists working there safe.\n\nGraphic design and visuals could be defined as grose and cute at the same time. All enemies you encounter are unique in terms of how they look and what they do, wrapped up in a cartoonish colorful look.\n\nBefore long you are freezing, bursting, frying and lasering hordes of strange-looking alien bug-beasts, and it feels so damn satisfying. Gameplay evolves around a static and unchanging environment where enemies dodge, crawl, fly, smash, bounce and even give birth to smaller versions of themselves. \n\nAs you progress through the levels you will acquire more powerful weapons, upgrades and power-ups. You will also collect coins from bugs you slaughtered in order to upgrade your stats and equipment. \n\nSoundtrack is absolutely amazing and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one day we get a soundtrack edition of the game.\n\nThe Bug Butcher is a fine example of a old-school style of gameplay with a lot of fun-factor involved. Although it lacks some verticality The Bug Butcher will make you spend hours on end progressing through the well designed and easy to look at lab slaughtering relentless hords of interesting and unique bug-like aliens.\n\n[url=https://pcgamesnnews.wordpress.com/2015/08/08/preview-the-bug-butcher/]Full review[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1439047612, "timestamp_updated": 1439047659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598540", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17423937": {"recommendationid": "17423937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006985107", "num_games_owned": 632, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438923245}, "language": "english", "review": "A fantastic modern take on classic vertical arcade shooters.

The developers have been putting a ton of work into the cartoon art style and terribly funny dialogue.\n\nYou first meet our hero as he arrives at a giant factory of sorts, where horrible alien space bugs have taken over the plant.  Running through the first few tutorial levels has you meet one of the factory workers, who appears to look a little like a talking Gameboy.  The dialogue and story are clever and funny, and the exposition provided by your guide is often scoffed about by the protagonist, due to it's completely satirical nature.\n\nThese first few moments set you up for the initial extremely addicting gameplay.  Dropping you through one room at a time, you must fire your gun upwards as the alien bugs drop from the ceiling and other areas, and bounce around the screen.  Each bug has unique skills and properties and you have to adapt to each as they fall from above.  Killing them earns you coins, and a score multiplier to rack up the points after each kill.  Every level has three to four waves of creatures before you can proceed to the next level, and of course, there is a time limit applied that you must beat.  As you are only able to shoot straight up, and can't jump, each shot has to be well timed as you avoid your bouncing enemies.\n\nAs the levels progress you're given a variety of powerups to use, that either increase your speed, power of your gun or give you temporary new weapons that cause mass destruction across the screen. These weapons can range from homing rockets, to a powerful laser that disintegrates everything, a gatling gun that fires at a high rate but needs to be charged, or a electric gun that on a successful hit jumps to other foes.  After enough kills you'll also gain a special attack with a variety of effects.  You can fire off more rockets, freeze everything on the screen, or even gain temporary invincibility and speed.  You'll need to use them all if you're going to survive the later levels.\n\nDifficulty ramps up fast in The Bug Butcher.  Every level introduces new enemies.  Some are explained but others come out as a surprise and you'll have to quickly react to their new abilities and patterns.  At some points there are so many different foes on the screen it becomes almost impossible to survive as you try to dodge and take out the most dangerous enemies first.  Gameplay is broken up even more with elevator levels that take away some of your weapon drops, or other levels with various moving platforms or force fields that redirect your enemies bouncing and can either be a boon or a burden depending on what  you are dealing with at each moment.\n\nThe soundtrack keeps up with the action throughout, and gets your blood flowing.  The up beat electronic music really brings me back to my retro roots, and hours spent at the arcade, or in similar games on late consoles.  The music really keeps you on pace and meshes well with the chaos on the screen.\n\nThroughout all these busy levels, the gameplay doesn't miss a beat.  I rarely saw my FPS drop below 60 regardless of how many enemies were on the screen.  It remained smooth and fast, aiding in the overly addictive nature of the game.  Frustrating death after frustrating death couldn't keep me from giving it one more go, or trying out the next level.  Each successful level rewards you with a star rating, and comparison to your steam friends and the overal rankings.  You'll also get new weapon drops as you go, as the game is really good at introducing something new with almost every level.\n\nWith competitive local multiplayer support planned, players are sure to have tense competitive battles with their friends shortly.  We can only hope that developer Awfully Nice Studios also has online multiplayer planned in a later update to really create a gem of fun gaming here.  \n\nwww.micbemac.com", "timestamp_created": 1437943842, "timestamp_updated": 1437943842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999600", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17237279": {"recommendationid": "17237279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011294928", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453989087}, "language": "dutch", "review": "Great game a bit frustrating but all games need that to be fun i suppose :p\n\nOnly downside i could think about is no deep leaderboards to compare how good you do with other people.

Check. Addictive? Check. Funny? Check. Soundtrack? Checkmate. The Bug Butcher in a nutshell? Amazing. \n\nThe Bug Butcher is a action shooter from Awfully Nice Studios. Currently, in Early Access on Steam for $7.99 (on sale from it's launch price of $9.99). Just having finished my first look of the game I have to say It's been awesome.\n\nYou see I've been following The Bug Butcher since around February when I found it had been Greenlit through Steam. While following on Facebook I was able to see this game developed over the last several months and with each animated enemy gif they posted I would get more and more interested. The art style alone is enough to want to give it a shot. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/FDTSpLUNP64?t=16m50s\n\nOn the surface it seems that The Bug Butcher is a stylized shoot 'em up. Where the enemies are a series of very well designed bug alien creature thingies (I imagine this whole thing takes place way in the future on the bug planet Klendathu but that's my fantasy). Your ultimate goal is to splatter their gooey insides all over this space station and save the day. \nYou are fighting against the clock, leveling power ups, leveling perks, and frantically building your power up meter to beat the round. Trust me you'll need the power ups in the harder difficulties as you only have 1 health. As you finish each level you are awarded stars based on your final score, there are a possible 4 stars per level. You are also given coins, these coins are used to purchase upgrades to the aforementioned perks and power ups. The power ups are random and unlock at certain levels, the two I came across were rapid fire and freeze grenades. \n\nFor an early access game The Bug Butcher is polished very well. All the animation, sound production, and gameplay is tight and well done. I didn't come across anything that stood out as \"broken\". It gets an A+ there. Having followed the development over the last few months I'm excited for the rest of the content, which includes a split-screen head to head multiplayer mode. From the looks of it, it reminds me of two player Bubble Bobble or Tetris, where you are both playing the same map simultaneously and as you do better it hurts your opponent. \n\nOverall, I think The Bug Butcher is a great early access title worth your time. It looks great, sounds great, and plays great. \n\"The Only Good Bug, Is a Dead Bug!\" (Starship Troopers)\n\nFor more Indie Games, Movies and Music check out EarlyAccessMedia.com, EarlyAccessPodcast.com and YouTube.com/EarlyAccessPodcast", "timestamp_created": 1437599286, "timestamp_updated": 1437599286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17168084": {"recommendationid": "17168084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119812876", "num_games_owned": 3163, "num_reviews": 149, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467583231}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uac24\ub7ec\uadf8\ucc98\ub7fc \uc704\ub85c \uc3d8\ub294 \uc288\ud305\uc7a5\ub974\uc774\ub2e4.\n\n\uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc9c0 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ud589\uc774 \ub418\uba70, \ucd1d \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ub294 3\uac1c\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud55c\ub2e4\n\uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc9c0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5bb\ub294 \ub3c8\uc73c\ub85c \ubb34\uae30\ub4f1\uc744 \uc5c5\uadf8\ub808\uc774\ub4dc\ud560\uc218\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.\n\n\uac8c\uc784\ubaa8\ub4dc\ub294 \ucd1d3\uac1c\uac00 \uc788\ub294\ub370 \uc5bc\ub9ac\uc911\uc774\ub77c  \ud604\uc7ac \uc544\ucf00\uc774\ub4dc\ubaa8\ub4dc\ub9cc \uc5f4\ub824\uc788\ub2e4.\n\n\ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\ub294 \uc815\ud574\uc9c4 \uacf5\uac04\uc548\uc5d0\uc11c \uc704/\uc544\ub798/\uc0ac\uc774\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ub098\uc624\ub294 \uc801\ub4e4\uc744\n\uc704\ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c\ub9cc \uc3f4\uc11c \uc801\uc744 \uc5c6\uc560\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.\n\uc801\uc740 \uc8fd\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \ub3c8\uc774\ub098 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc744 \ub5a8\uad70\ub2e4.\n\n\uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc744 \uc8fd\uc774\ub294\uac83\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c\nNPC\ub3d9\ub8cc\ub97c \ubcf4\ud638\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc7a1\ud600\uac00\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac8c \ud574\uc57c\ud55c\ub2e4.\n\n\uac01 \uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc9c0\ub294 \uc2dc\uac04\uc81c\ud55c\uc774 \uc788\uace0,\n\uadf8 \uc2dc\uac04\uc548\uc5d0 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc801\uc744 \uc5c6\uc560\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4.\n\ub610\ud55c \ucf64\ubcf4\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uace0, \uc810\uc218\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubc1b\ub294 \ub4f1\uae09\uc774 \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c0\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0\n\ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc2a4\ud14c\uc774\uc9c0\ub97c \ucd5c\uace0\ub85c \ubc1b\uc73c\ub824\uba74 \ub178\ub825\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud560\ub4ef\ud558\ub2e4\n\n\uac04\ub2e8\ud55c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc (\ud0a4\uc0ac\uc6a9\ub3c4 \ubc29\ud5a5+\uc288\ud305+\ud30c\uc6cc\uc5c5 \ub05d\uc774\ub2e4.)\n\uc758\uc678\ub85c \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc5ec\uc57c \ud560\uac8c \ub9ce\uc544 \ubc14\uc05c \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1437544219, "timestamp_updated": 1437544219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17161399": {"recommendationid": "17161399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030086046", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508332620}, "language": "german", "review": "Kurzum in dem Spiel gehts darum sich durch ein Labor voller \"K\u00e4fer und Spinnen\" zu K\u00e4mpfen, \nMomentan ist Lediglich der Singleplayermodus offen und in dem auch nur 4 Karten, die Schwierigkeitsstufe bleibt dabei auch relativ knackig.\n\nEin Multiplayer bzw.

Let me say this: Normally I'm not a big fan of 2D platformers, but this title got me hooked from start to the last level of the current beta!\n\nIt has been a while since an early access indy title caught my attention. Last time it was \"The Darkest Dungeon\". In therms of level of polish this title reminds me a lot of the latter. But let's go into more detail:\n\nTHE PROS:\n[list]\n[*]Purely amazing grafics! I just LOVE the style of the characters, the enemies, their movement, the weapons, the FX. Let me tell you, there are AAA titles out there, which could learn a thing or two from this indy game... The first time I played \"the darkest dungeon\" was kind of similar in terms of grafics: You just don't expect THAT level of polish from an indy studio.\n[*]Very interesting core loop: You can and will only shoot upwards and will have to calculate your movement and your weapon fire according to enemies movement. First it's pretty hard, but once you got the trajectories of the enemies mapped in your brain, the game starts getting addicitve! Also most of the enemies bounce a bit upwards, once you hit them. So after half an hour and after buying my first couple of upgrades I had the bugs basically dancing around my head without hurting me. - Very satisfying.\n[*]The power-ups in this game only last for a couple of seconds. But oh boy, if you make those seconds count you will really feel like a pro-exterminator!\n[*]The behaviour of the enemies is very well done and very well balanced. You have everything from lightning-spewing-firefly to big-ass-bug-birthing-blue-thing to scientist-eating-ceiling-crawler. Again I have to congratulate the devs to their top notch creativity and unique animation style.\n[*]The upgrades are promising. You can feel the difference after every upgrade you buy. I even unlocked the +30% speed perk and let me tell you: The game plays completely different after that. Much more agressive.\n[/list]\n\nTHE CONS:\n[list]\n[*]Even on \"easy\" the game is pretty hard! I've just seen a guy on twitch basically losing his nerves and nearly biting his constroller. The devs might need to work on the difficulty. Or they might just leave it as is. There are lot's of easy-to-play games out there.\n[*]On my high-end computer (2x Gforce GTX980ti, win8.1) I get a lot of interface bugs, like stars not showing up or the score not being visible after a match. The score is there, it's just hidden. But since it's only launch day and this is an early access title anyways I think the devs will have this fixed pretty soon.\n[*]The game is pretty short at the moment. After the first three areas it says \"end of beta\". Took me about 2 hours to play through on \"easy\". \n[*]You can play the game with the keyboard, but with a controler it's just much more fun.\n[/list]\n\nAll in all I can [b]totally recommend this game[/b], even with it being an early access title. It's wonderfully crafted, has good game design, a lot of challenges. Go for it, especially at the launch-price of 7,99 euros it's worth your while. With that price it cost less than the last movie ticket I bought (for Ant-Man, LOL) and was way more fun than that movie ;-)", "timestamp_created": 1437426472, "timestamp_updated": 1437426795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999048", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17146408": {"recommendationid": "17146408", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963635044", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453507947}, "language": "german", "review": "[b] [h1]Finally!

Shoot a large alien and it divides into two medium ones, shoot THEM and they divide again into two small ones. If you fail to mop up the smaller aliens, you become overwhelmed. \n\nBut as the game throws more types of alien at you, it becomes a game of tactics and timing. Can you dash under those five bouncing aliens to get to that crucial power-up? When do you set off the kill-everything homing missiles? Which alien is the priority kill?\n\nGameplay video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_sJdW4x58I\n\nSoon enough the aliens require your every reaction to deal with. There's a roof-crawling ant thing that blasts down a vertical pole of lightning for several seconds at a time. There's a leaping facehugger that means instant death. And one plant-like thing slowly sucks up your NPC friend in the background and, if you don't kill the plant in time it'll fail you the level. And so on.\n\nThe cartoon art is excellent and funny. The alien pests are full of bug-eyed charm, explosions feel satisfying and your hero Harry gets all the best lines.\n\nThe levels are scored in a very Angry Birds three-star system. You can progress just for completing the level, but getting just one star does hurt and you'll want to try again. The key to high scores is keeping a chain of kills (ie combos) going without being hurt. Some levels you'll unlock new weapons and power-ups. \n\nEvery coin you collect on a completed level earns you coins that you can spend on permanently upgrading your character (weapon power, power-up strength, speed boost etc). Flipside, there's less incentive to keep plugging away for three-star ratings early on when you know your character can be much stronger after a few more levels. \n\nThe levels are split into groups of six, each group taking place in one location in the research facility. Six feels like a lot - by the fifth, it feels a bit \"this room AGAIN?!\". But then the final level suddenly throws you into a confined elevator level, a kind of boss-style encounter where flames shoot from the walls. Each set of levels is sufficiently different, adding temporary barriers, platforms or a, er, kind of stompy thing. More levels and bosses are planned.\n\nThe game never feels unfair, even on hard mode where any contact with an alien is instant death. It's heart-pounding at times, with twitch reactions needed. The only real problem is that the core mechanic doesn't lend itself to huge variations in gameplay, no matter how many alien types are throw at you. It's best played for shorter sessions of score attack than trying to just plough through to the end as soon as possible (which, on easy, won't take too long).\n\nThis review is of the pre-release beta of the early access Steam version, with 18 out of a planned 30 levels implemented.

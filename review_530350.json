An animated teleport must be tossed to a desired teleport location. Once it lands on a flat surface (it will bounce off of non-flat surfaces), a short animation takes place before teleporting the player.\nA player can cancel their teleport at anytime once it is thrown, and enemy players can cancel each other's teleporters. Many strategies have developed between players using the teleport disc alone. Faking out with teleporters, distracting before shooting, and teleporting onto moving objects.\n\nAfter 300 hours of play time it is safe to say Smashbox Arena is by far the best VR experience I have had since purchasing my Vive. The community surrounding this game is one of the most welcoming I've ever experienced. \n\nHaving taken part in multiple community held tournaments and leagues it's safe to say competitive multiplayer VR is here, and Smashbox is the definition of a VR eSport.\n\nAt first glance the gameplay of Smashbox Arena is quite simple. Pick up and shoot balls, teleport around, and knock out the opposing team in 3v3 fights. This simplicity makes Smashbox easy to pick up for new VR players, and highly acessible for venues like VR Arcades.\n\nThe gameplay contains an added depth thanks to its reliance on room-scale VR. Players can, and must, dodge, lean, crouch, and utilize all 360 degrees in order to master the game.\n\nIf you have a room-scale VR set up give the Smashbox Arena demo a try. It is the full game but limited to a single map. Players who have purchased the game can jump into the demo game along side you. \n\nCheck out the guides and discussion boards for tips on how to handle yourself in game, as there is a bit of a skill curve between new and veteran players. If you'd like someone to help you out feel free to send me a friend request here on steam.\n\nThere are full games being player every day in Smashbox Arena, and it is quite popular at multiple VR Arcades.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1497388943, "timestamp_updated": 1497388943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32261289": {"recommendationid": "32261289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198215154793", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493820970}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u7d20\u6674\u3089\u3057\u304f\u697d\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\uff01\n\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u3053\u308d\u306b\u516c\u5712\u3067\u3084\u3063\u305f\u5f53\u3066\u3063\u3053\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u601d\u3044\u51fa\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n\u76f8\u624b\u306b\u898b\u3064\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044\u3088\u3046\u306b\u80cc\u5f8c\u306b\u56de\u3063\u305f\u3068\u304d\u306e\u723d\u5feb\u611f\u3084\u3001\u9006\u306b\u6c17\u4ed8\u304b\u305a\u306b\u5f53\u3066\u3089\u308c\u305f\u6642\u306e\u6094\u3057\u3055\u306a\u3069\u3001\u7ae5\u5fc3\u306b\u8fd4\u3063\u3066\u697d\u3057\u3081\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u907f\u3051\u308b\u3001\u96a0\u308c\u308b\u306a\u3069VR\u4ee5\u5916\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u306f\u4f53\u9a13\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3001\u6b63\u3057\u304fVR\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\u826f\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3068\u601d\u3048\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059\u3002\nVR\u30e6\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u306a\u3089\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\u9593\u9055\u3044\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\n\u30aa\u30b9\u30b9\u30e1\u3067\u3059\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1496897992, "timestamp_updated": 1496897992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32007748": {"recommendationid": "32007748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284753782", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489712620}, "language": "english", "review": "simple and fun, worth the price", "timestamp_created": 1495927782, "timestamp_updated": 1495927782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503386", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31963719": {"recommendationid": "31963719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047453073", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502178488}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game its like a super intense game of dodgeball!\n\nSingle player is fun and Hard mode is actually hard!

There are still a couple of weird bugs here and there, for example the game keeps freezing if I try to exit out of it.\n\nGraphics and gameplay were otherwise great - very fun, enganging, and unique among all the other VR shooters.

It's a blast, and super simple to learn, pick up, and get going.\n\nThe guns will suck up balls from the ground. One ball per gun at a time, and while you can teleport from either hand, the hand has to be empty. This leads to a wonderful balance between being \"loaded\" with 2 shots, and mobility. You can defend yourself with a ball, or you can catch incoming balls if you have good timing. As I said, very simple, but amazingly compelling. When you get hit and are \"out\" you can view the current level and all players in diorama scale, and it's really freaking cool.\n\n$30 might be a little much for an asking price, but it's a lot of fun, and easily something you'll demo to VR newbies.

The menu has you taking \"shuttles\" to the different game modes, the AI is quite competent (and kicks my ass at medium difficulty) and the training mode is the perfect intro for new players.\n\nAs a beta, there's still a couple bugs that pop up from time to time, and it's a little odd have two totally different announer voices, but that's really all I can find to nitpick.

Rather, I actually had the very strong sensation that I was back playing gun game in CS:S - the maps are small, with a variety of different weapons, and the rounds are quick. \n\nThe bots are good, and the game includes both a tutorial and a short single player 'story' mode, so if you want to get up to speed before playing against real people, you can. I'd recommend just doing the tutorial, though, and jumping straight into multiplayer.

This essentially is paintball from rec room with a few more bells and whistles (power ups, better teleport mechanic, ability to block/catch incoming balls) and some polish on top. I bought this game after seeing the highly positive reviews here on steam and praise for it on the vive subreddit.\n\nI played about ten multiplayer games and I realized the game wasn't a hit for me.  There were several problems which  stood out to me:\n\n1. As someone playing from Europe, I had to play on the US East region since that's the default region and no one switched to the European one. Perhaps some way to automatically set the best default region would be better? As a result I had some pretty noticeable lag  with a ping varying from 110 to 160. The game felt floaty at times. This is especially noticeable when dying - I would get hit, and after a blink of eye I was dead, still giving me some time to react before the game actually said I was dead.\n\n2. Maybe this is also a problem only when playing from Europe - I played the game on a Thursday since my schedule only lets me game on weekdays - but of the ten games I played, only two didn't have two or more bots. Now I'm not against the bots in this game (they're okay - like rocket league bots they sort of just stand  around and sometimes randomly do something good), and it's a good idea to fill up to a 3 v 3 - but it still kind of sucks to play with/against bots. On top of that, somehow the bots were poorly distributed in one of the matches I played. It was a 3 players vs 1 player and 2 bots match - that was a really unfair + not fun match.\n\n3. I personally dislike the teleport mechanism in shooting or shooting-like games in general. Smashbox Arena does improve on the mechanic by letting people see where another person is going to teleport to before it actually happens. This does not, however, prevent people from sneaking up behind you far  quicker than it would normally be possible, which makes cover far less valuable. This certainly makes the game more action heavy and fast-paced, but for my tastes it was too chaotic.\n\nHowever, if you like the paint ball game in rec room and you're playing from North America - then this game should be right up your alley.

I found myself booting it up for the first time to just give it a quick try and see what all the hype was about... Fast forward 4 hours and I'm still having a blast at 4:34am.\n\n- The story mode. I think the story mode is a fantastic way to introduce players into the game! The difficulties scale decently well and allow players to get a feel for the game before jumping into multiplayer! It could have a bit more added to it as far as content goes, but seeing as how the primary focus of this game is it's multiplayer aspect, it's really easy to overlook.\n\n- Great community. I guess this really speaks for the whole VR community in general, but I've met some of the nicest people in this game. Hardly any toxicity!\n\nCons:\n\n- Matchmaking. Just like any multiplayer game, there will be multitudes of different skill levels amongst players. This game does have a sort of ranking system where players can earn badges, but there isn't any sort of filtering along with that.. For example if three veterans join a game with 3 newbies, the veterans could end up all on the same team resulting in an incredibly unbalanced game.\n\n- Bugs. There are bound to be bugs in nearly any VR game. That's just a given. Even so, there's one particular bug that I've seen multiple times now in which players are able to reach through walls. For example if I'm standing on one side of a wall and you're standing on the other, I can reach my gun forward and stick it through the wall in some cases and shoot you. Not necesarily game breaking, but a definite annoyance.\n\n- Bots. The bots in this game, even on their hardest difficulty, aren't much of a challenge. I was able to breeze through all three difficulties in story mode fairly easily. I think some improvements to map awareness for the bots would do wonders as there are times where they get stuck trying to teleport to the same spot over and over. Another thing is that they don't turn in your direction when firing. So if the bot is looking and pointing it's gun to the right, and I'm to it's left, the ball will shoot sideways out of it's gun and hit. This isn't too big of a deal once you get used to it but it can be a bit annoying when a bot is turned one way, making you believe his focus is elsewhere, and then suddenly a ball comes flying towards your face.\n\n- Hitbox. The hitboxes in this game can be a bit inconsistent at times. For the most part it's not a problem but there has been a time or two where I've deflected a ball directly away from me but it still registers as a hit. I debated even adding this to cons because of how rarely it happend, but it *did* happen so I figured I should at least say something.\n\n\nThe verdict: BUY IT!

Multiplayer is an absolute blast and the game's fundamental mechanics are really solid. There's lots of strategy and skill in how you aim your teleports, take cover, account for ball flight and bounce when you aim, and use deflections and catches to protect yourself. For those that prefer trackpad-based motion, rest assured that this game is still worth it. I generally prefer trackpad myself, but the mechanics in this game work perfectly for its style of play\n\nMultiplayer features 3x3 gameplay, with bots that are automatically rotated in and out of teams to keep things balanced. You're eliminated by a single hit, and each team scores a point when they've knocked out all of the opposing members. First to five wins. When you're knocked out, you see a live map overview that can be rotated and zoomed - and best of all, can continue to shout out encouragement (and warnings) to your teammates. Since rounds finish quickly, you're never waiting to play again for more than a minute. \n\nI was impressed by the variety of maps available at launch - and how they encourage a mix of close-quarter and larger-scale gameplay. The power-ups also add some fun unpredictableness to matches, although a few of them feel a bit nerfed (the homing missile is way too slow, for example). Graphics are clean and smooth. I have had zero technical glitches during gameplay so far.\n\nKudos for the developers for delivering such a polished and fun game!\n", "timestamp_created": 1481500470, "timestamp_updated": 1481500470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501458", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28317182": {"recommendationid": "28317182", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970784311", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 79, "last_played": 1514316867}, "language": "english", "review": "I just bought a VIVE.

The price seems perfectly fair to me for a game with this high of replay value - I have 2 HTC Vives so after playing for < 10 minutes I had purchased a 2nd copy; this is probably the most fun I've had with the Vive in the ~7 months I have owned it. I set supersampling to 1.6 and it looks really clean while barely taxing 50% of my GTX 1080 so this is a game that will likely play well across a wide range of hardware.\n\nBecause of the way the game flows, I believe this is one of the better solutions to the \"terminal mass\" issue other multiplayer VR games suffer from. AI bots seamlessly pop in/out of matches to keep things interesting even when you don't have a full 6-player match going and I believe Smashbox Arena will quickly gain in popularity. The number of people I've already heard telling their wives/etc in the background, \"just one more round!\" only to stick around for another dozen rounds goes to show how addicting this game is.\n\nI had no part in the beta/etc and heard about this game for the first time on Reddit 2 days ago. It's easy enough to pick up and play for pretty much anybody and it has a lot of unique elements that make it something special. The only thing I'd like to see (off the top of my head) are some additional game modes down the road such as Capture the Flag/etc (a la Splatoon on the Wii U - one of my all-time favorite games.)\n\nIf you're on the fence... I say go for it. Between my 2 Vives I have purchased over 100 VR titels (and multiple copies of a number of multiplayer games) and I think this is probably my best purchase yet.

The powerups are just a ton of fun, really adds a lot of flavor to the game.\n\nMy favorite part however definitely has to be the community. Everyone I've met has been super chill and a lot of fun to play with. I think that's a credit to the \"silly\" design of the game. You won't get a lot of try-hards playing a dodgeball game with magic powerups, and I think that's great! The voice chat is done so well and the spectator view is great when y ou're out. Every down to the wire match had everyone  yelling and then laughing at the end. Never had so much fun in VR, it's my go-to game on the Vive right now.

Yes 25 hours.  In one week.  This more than anything else I can say is a testament to how good Smashbox arena is, but let me elaborate more anyway.\n\nThere are a lot of VR games that are \"wow\" experiences.  There are currently still very few \"just one more game and it's 1AM\" experiences.  Smashbox Arena is this kind of game.  \n\nWhat makes this game work so well is simply the amount of careful design balance that has been applied to the level design and the power ups and the ways the different power ups play off one another.  There are a lot of subtlies and nuances to the mechanics that gradually become more apparent the more you play and the more you talk to other players.  It's an incredibly easy game to pick up and start having fun with, but it remains fun because it's so well design that winning and losing isn't just simply a matter of reflexes.  It is often a matter of strategy and at any given moment you have a plethora of options on how you approach a given scenario. \n\nI know a lot of VR players have become rightly cynical about half finished games, cash grabs, and over hyped experiences.  A lot of even the bigger titles (like Arizona Sunshine) wouldn't really hold up as non-VR games, but they are championed because hey at least there is some substance.  This game is not one of those games. This game is the Rocket League of VR games; it is a similar indie Cinderella story.  This isn't jsut my favorite VR game this year.

I jumped into the beta at the last minute and had the opportunity to play for a few hours with some of the devs and other testers, and I was not expecting what I found here. This game is a gem and is easily in my top 3 Vive games this year.\n\nMany of the experiences I've had with other games felt short and unfinished; however Smashbox Arena is a fun, well-rounded multiplayer game that I know I will keep coming back to. As others have mentioned, It reminds me a lot like Rec Room paintball (my currently most-played game) and Unreal or Quake, and that's a good thing. The gameplay is fun, fast, and easy to jump into for a few minutes or a few hours. It takes a classic game like dodgeball and adds the multiplayer and powerup components of first-person shooters, creating a well designed virtual sport anyone can get into.\n\nThe maps are a good mixture of different-themed locales with interesting features that keep each game feeling fresh, requiring slightly different strategy depending on the environment. Each of the powerups have their pros and cons, depending on where you are, and the tie-breaker missile always gets everyone cheering (very reminiscent of the Redeemer in Unreal)! While the teams can become unbalanced occasionally, the game re-balances during map changes and does a good job of ensuring everyone has a fair chance. Seeing the trajectory of the shot that knocks you out is also a nice touch (I never question how I lost), and the god-mode spectator view is awesome (though a bit unwieldy to control). Overall, the quality of the game is excellent and you can tell that a lot of effort was put into its design and development.\n\nWhile I ran into some minor bugs with the AI, a bit of lag, and some other minor technical glitches, none of those issues really impact the experience I have with this game and I'm confident that the developers care about their community and will continue working to improve Smashbox Arena further.

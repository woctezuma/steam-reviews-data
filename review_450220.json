Not had this anywhere else, just that one spot in the tutorial.\n\nThe second issue is with the controls, right now I have only tried with my Razer Sabertooth (basically an XBOX 360 pad) and it felt horrible - that could just be me though.  Time to break out the Saitek X52 (which is what I played Descent 3 with) and see if it's better (probably will be).\n\nHowever, even with those minor glitches, this game FELT like Descent!  Even Descent 3 didn't feel like Descent (please do NOT bring that awful Guide Bot back!).  Cracking game, and my short stint in the teaser has convinced me...getting the full game (early access or not).  If, like me, you remember the first Descent fondly, then I think your gonna love this game!\n\n-edited silly spelling mistakes :(", "timestamp_created": 1498499715, "timestamp_updated": 1498499813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32793493": {"recommendationid": "32793493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216996861", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498435071}, "language": "english", "review": "I played the Demo level and immediately purchased.

The one thing the Demo proves is that the core gameplay is good. But aspects of it may change, or the level design might not be up to par in the full size levels. Or they might suddenly drop Linux support, although the presence of an actual Linux Demo is encouraging. \n\nSo, about this demo:\nPlayed this on Linux with my Saitek Cyborg Evo joystick that I recently bought used. I used the Keyboard for lateral movement. So WASD for forwards backwards and to the sides and Left-SHIFT and Space for up and down. Roll I bound to joystick twist. Deadzone I set to none.\n\nWith this Joystick the controls are a dream, the music is perfect and the opressive underground atmosphere all collaborate to make this short demo an experience I played through more than once, and had very much fun each time even though the demo is very short.\n\nI have no idea if it would be as fun with a mouse though, or even a gamepad. \n\nTo reiterate, I still urge caution with early access titles but this demo does prove they have nailed the core gameplay. As always, early access means things might change. Also, the price for the full game is steep for an early access title, early access pretty much means they expect you to do the work of a beta tester, only instead of getting paid for it YOU have to pay. I don't mind helping beta test a game that I get for less than the final price, but considering the hours you put into figuring out how to replicate bugs you find and write useful bug reports, the early access discount for this game is very bad pay.

From the ship movement to the weapons, fire rates, and enemy behaviors, it's like playing Descent 4. Similtaniously made me nostalgic, and the higher difficulties showed me how much these modern games have seriously dulled my skills. How long has it been since I had to replay the opening level of a game a half dozen times to beat it? I don't even know.\n\nI heard about the kickstarter, but I never put much stock into it and decided to wait and see. So far I am sufficiantly happy with what's been shown here.\n\nI can give some critiques though. It's hard to know if these will have any bearing on the game, but: It's short. Very short. I hope it is just demo short, but it seems to imply this is a full level from the game. Even for a starter level, it felt tiny compared to maps on Dsc3 (or Dsc1 and Dsc2).\n\nWhile there was a keycard to unlock a single door, it didn't really open up a massive segment of the map like they did on the old games. Again, maybe it's just because it's a demo, maybe it's just the very first level from the game, but it lowered my expectations for a return to form in quality non-linerar map design.\n\nI was happy to see a score page with how many secret areas I found (less than half) and how many items I had found. A nice touch for replayability. Now to see if the game lets you stock weapons and upgrades from level to level, or if you lose them all when you die and have to find them again. The demo only has you start over, which at least is a nice change from the complete lack of a fail state in most games these days.\n\nI also played it with the Steam Controller and in 21:9 and had a blast. I've been wanting to try out Dsc3 with it for a while, but didn't want the hassle of trying to get it to run.

I have not had this much fun or been challenged so desperately to survive in a very long time. Overload is the next True Six-Degrees of Freedom shooter. Made by the original developers of Decent (the 90's 6-DOF shooter), this new \"Revival\" of their once great gameplay mechanics and intense level designs has made me giddier than a schoolgirl. The demo is well designed and showcases their classic style of movement and solid gunplay in highly revitalized and gorgeous graphical tech. Some people may be skeptical of flying though tightly designed levels with little more to do then destroy, destroy, destroy. Sure, the aged style of gameplay and lack of miscellaneous objectives that will be present will not engage all audiences; However- with that being said, Doom 2016 is the classic style of Doom gunplay and level design that has once again captured the fun and challenge of the original arena style shooters. So it is with Overload. This game will ensare the visual and auditory senses and create a level of suspense and thrill through complex movement, tight gunplay, and well constructed levels that enhance and challenge both the movement and gunplay in a way that is not present in most modern shooters. While I obviously am a sucker for the classics, I feel I can safely say this game will please most audiences looking for a new tight knit shooter. I encourage all reading this review to try the demo and stick with it for an hour to get comfortable with the controls and have a blast in challenge mode.

The destroy the reactor level really feels, to me, like the old Descent series, which I have always loved, and still play to this day. The only thing missing is the ship bobbing up and down, which, absolutely must be included in the full version. Above and beyond this level are the challenge levels, which are perfectly designed, and really fun to play. The music is, absolutely, reminiscent of the original Descent series, and I love it. Also, the ship flies perfectly, just like Descent, even without the bobbing. Overall, in every detail, Overload is Descent without the Descent name, and that is a good thing.

This playable teaser gives a feeling that the game has been tested in the way of gameplay because the gampleay feels smooth and challenging but not impossible. This is going to be the successor to Descent and by this teaser it is already obvious that it will turn out better than the current installment of Mechwarrior. This game also doesn't stray too far from the style of Descent and shows it in this teaser where you have 3 enemy types, four maps, five primary weapons, and four missile types. The primary weapons are comparable to those in Descent:\n[olist]\n[*]Impulse: Similar to the lasers but as of now there are no damage or quad upgrades\n[*]Driller: Similar to the Gauss Cannon of Descent 2. Probably one of my favorite weapons\n[*]Flak Cannon: This one isn't similar to any Descent weapons but could be closest to the Vulcan but it seems to be a very close range ballistic weapon with high spread and fire rate.\n[*]Vortex: Similar to the Spreadpulse. Shoots three bolts in a rotating line.\n[*]Thunderbolt: This is identical to the Fusion Cannon. Charge it up and deal a lot of damage.\n[/olist]\nAnd for the missiles you have:\n[olist]\n[*]Falcons: These are basically concussion missiles, a basic dumbfire missile.\n[*]Hunters: The name might be incorrect but they are homing missiles that fire in pairs.\n[*]Creepers: These are like Smart Mines, if smart mines moved to enemies and had shot velocity.\n[*]Devastator: Closest to the Mega missile but doesn't seem to have as large of a blast radius.\n[/olist]\nSo now that the weapons are covered let's talk about the graphics\n\nThe game runs in Unity 5 and uses DirectX 11 which by hearing Unity a person could expect lackluster graphics or a really bad framerate. When I first looked at the youtube video of this game it looked like they were using the Unreal Engine but to my surpirse Unity is used and it runs well while still looking great. With my GTX650Ti I can get 40-60 fps with max graphics and only turning ambient occlusion off. So the graphics are great, the game runs great, and the level design is very reminiscent of Descent 1 except the rock faces don't have to be blocky due to better technology and whatnot.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is likely to turn out to be very, very good and the only move regarding the way people are able to support the project that could be made to better the popularity and possibly increase support is to make it possible to pay for it through Steam. If this change was made, I believe that more funding would come by people seeing it on steam, having money in their steam wallet, and thinking \"why not.\"", "timestamp_created": 1467061633, "timestamp_updated": 1467061633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.950617", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23717480": {"recommendationid": "23717480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149525904", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488835682}, "language": "english", "review": "Ohhh yes yes yes!

It is everything I've been wanting from a descent game since Descent 1-3 came out, and even if it doesn't carry the name, after playing it you will understand. This game has the heart and soul of descent. The atmosphere is created by the levels, music, and robot sounds. The bots dodge, flank, and run away from you. Controls felt perfect, and that was at the default settings. Very well done, and this is just the playable teaser. It's free to try, and you should. I love every bit of this.\n\nUPDATE: As of March 3, 2017, Revival has released version 2.0 of this Playable Teaser. They've absolutely blown me away with the fun this game gives you. The sound is phenominal, the music is a steady heartpounding thrill, the bots are mean looking and persistant, the weapons are fulfilling, and the combat will have you quickly forgetting how long you've been playing. The entire teaser has had an overall, the graphics are updated, the weapons changed (for the better), more bots added, gameplay mechanics refreshed, and the AUTOMAP is introduced!

One year for my birthday we played a Descent II LAN game for 24 hours straight in a single, small (but great!) level (our weapon updated D2 port of Mega-Death). I have played Descent a lot, and have continued to play it thanks to DosBox and Descent Rebirth. We even had a weekly on-line tournament going for the past few years, until recently. I am not the best Descent player out there, but I have the best time playing Descent and playing Descent multiplayer. I have only played the 'teaser' build on a system made mostly out of spare parts, and I already see Descent II almost as a distant memory. Much like Descent I was after playing Descent II. No other game has captured the immersion, the feel, and the greatness of Descent I & II until now, until Overload.

I had to ask the BBS owner special access rights for the files. Then I had to beg my parents to leave the phone alone so my download wouldn't be interrupted. Then I waited for hours as the 6 whopping megabytes (!) were being sucked through that little copper wire. And boy, was it worth it!\n\nHow things have changed. I clicked \"download\" on Steam, waited 2 minutes for the 600Mb teaser to install, and I was ready to play. And boy, how things remained the same!\n\nThis is Descent all over, but that's not all good. We're in a new millenium now, and we do expect a bit more.\n\n1) The lighting of the levels is exactly as it was 20 years ago: all dark gray, with some lights thrown in at odd angles. No volumetric light, no fog, very little dynamic lighting. Crank it up guys, I want explosions to light those rooms up! I want sparks bouncing off my monitor!\n2) The enemies so far seem pretty dumb and follow a recipe that's 20 years overcooked: see player, make warning noise, approach player, shoot once every while. Wolfenstein did that, so did Doom 1, 2 and Descent 1. That was a time when precious CPU cycles had to be spent on graphics. These days, I have CPU cores idling and begging for smarter enemies! Give us AI! Give us sneaky backstabbing bots! Give us cooperative swarms! And my pet peeve in all shooters: give us enemies that PULL THAT TRIGGER as long as they see the player! What enemy is going to release their trigger just to prance around a bit? Make their guns a bit weaker for balance if you have to, but MAKE THEM USE IT!\n3) The levels I've seen so far are entirely static. I can practically see the vertices of the mesh. If my ship is a converted mining operator, I would've really liked to dig some new holes. At the very least, shooting my \"digger\", my lasers or the rockets should have *some* effect to the walls. Apart from a few \"scorched\" marks, that's probably not going to happen because it would require a rewrite of the engine and a redesign of the levels. Oh well.\n4) If a bot charges into me, surely that should impact my camera, my trajectory, my rotation! None of the bots seem to have any weight to them. All animations seem entirely static, just like 20 years ago. Add some rigidbody physics please. Even if a rocket impact doesn't kill them, it should at least toss them around a little bit (that would be a reason for them to release their trigger temporarily). Hitting them with lasers should also send them spinning. Heck, getting hit should send us spinning as well! The lasers should blind us, too. Getting hit needs to be scary! \n5) Aiming with a joystick or a gamepad is always a bit difficult for me. I used to play with mouse and keyboard but this time I'm trying the gamepad. I'll need to practice more before I know whether I like the gamepad.\n6) music is MIDI synth straight from the 80's. I wouldn't mind something with more oomph.\n7) sound effects seem to have been copied from the Descent 1 project folder. Give us more echo, more ricochet, more stereo, more surround, make us hear the debris around us!\n8) we're in the future, but our ship couldn't have a litlte rearview mirror? Really? ;-)\n\nIt's not all bad, though!\n6) As in the earlier Descent, the levels are wonderfully desorienting. Up is left, right becomes down, forward twists up, down twists backwards. This room looks familiar. Maybe I was here upside down? Love it!\n7) My heart started pumping when that little yellow bot charged straight at me! And boy, was it difficult to strafe out of the path of destruction and at the same time get my crosshairs trained on that overactive little bugger for long enoug to shred it to pieces. And BOY, did it feel good when I finally got it!\n8) yup, it still feels good to jet forward on full thrusters, guns blazing, rockets lighting up the twisting tunnels and not care about scraping my ship against the dirty rocky walls. This is flying, baby! Bring it on!\n9) my little Athlon X2 with 4g RAM and NVidia 650ti runs this teaser beautifully. I'll definitely continue to play this until the final game comes out!\n\n\nBring this game to the new millenium and I will happily spend my money on it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1460580775, "timestamp_updated": 1460580775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502500", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22385449": {"recommendationid": "22385449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055441592", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487968261}, "language": "english", "review": "So im gonna have to decend into some mine shaft with evil robots again huh?

Winding through twisted passageways filled with demented robots around every corner, pulse pounding as you try to peer around the next bend only to hear the lockon of a homing missle from a red hulk that snuck around behind you somehow or was behind a door you just triggered, these types of thrilling moments had me on the edge of my chair the entire time I was playing those games. Throw in the six degrees of freedom and it's like playing Quake or Doom but unchained, where movement in any direction is possible and fighting takes on a whole new level of skill. Suddenly ceilings or walls become floors and up or down become relative. Which really sucks when you have an entire twisty spiderwebbed level to traverse to find the exit door after blowing a reactor. \n\nAll of these things play through my head when I think of Descent. I was a part of the Descent:Underground kickstarter and look forward to great things from that side of the house. These are the original guys however that first blew my mind with the genre defining game. After playing just the demo, I can say it feels like I'm back in that first great trip through the mines again! There aren't many bots, but they are unique and menacing. There aren't many weapons, but they each feel different and purposeful. The areas in the demo aren't large but they are interesting. Most importantly though, I just love playing it! I could and probably will sit and play the challenge mode for hours on end over the coming months. Sure it has bugs, but for a pre-alpha demo it's suprisingly well put together. The challenge mode has same appeal of UberMosh or old school Unreal Tournament to me. Jump in a challenge on hard for just a couple matches after work to destress and see how well you do.\n\nI can't wait until the full game is released, certainly this is one for any Descent fan to be excited about!", "timestamp_created": 1457947011, "timestamp_updated": 1457947011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21829812": {"recommendationid": "21829812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018236378", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457933574}, "language": "english", "review": "TLDR: Awesome demo, with one or two missteps. 5-20 minutes of fun for free, I recommend.\n\nThe game is slightly disorienting but it's got some real potential. I rather enjoyed my five minutes of zero-G dogfighting, and I hope to see the game come out swinging when it releases.\n\nThe good:\n1: Movement. As the game says, you can move freely in any direction you please. the experience is like flying a space helicopter with no set up or down. The game will orient you somewhat, helping to keep you in line with walls and floors, which is really helpful. In addition, all enemies will orient themselves to match you, which makes them easy to swiftly recognize and fire on.\n2: Mechanics. I will admit, the system of grabbing powerups and weapons feels a little old-school, but the weapons themselves aren't bad. Though the driller wasn't particularly exciting, the flak gun was fun, and Lightning felt badass. The explosives were slightly more confusing, as I had no idea what a 'creeper' was (It seemed to be a sort of grenade, so I ended up panic-spamming it a lot) but they felt alright.\n3: Presentation. This is a pre-alpha teaser, and as such it didn't have to look amazing, but looking at the enemy ships (Robots?) gave it a good sense of style, and the effects looked pretty nice. And this is only pre-alpha. If the art keeps improving, it'll look great!\n\nThe bad:\n1: The reticle. It's rare to have an element of the UI affect the gameplay, but the reticle (The 'aiming crosshairs', for those who don't know) got in my way a bit. The shape was helpful is figuring out how my primary weapon's shots would land, but the lines were thick and bright enough that looking past them to see threats in the distance was rough. It's not a big deal in many of the more confined corridors, but there was at least one or two dogfights where I wanted to turn it off. In the end, it's a small, easy fix that ought to be fixed fast.\n2: Weapons satisfaction. I know it might not be true that EVERY weapon in a game is satisfying to use, but a few of the weapons' sounds, effects, and function weren't super fun. Particularly thinking of the driller and the falcon missiles. Not a big deal, as there's enough other guns to find and test out (Flak is fun, guys. Find it, try it, celebrate the fourth of july.) that you'll have fun.\n3: Lack of direction/instruction. This didn't affect me a WHOLE lot, but it was pretty easy to get lost in some of these levels, and though I think the tutorial map told you about the driller, there weren't a lot of tooltips for the weapons, telling you what they do and such. The starter gun, driller, and flak all function as machine gun weapons, but the lightning gun is a charge weapon reminiscent of a megabuster. The falcon, hunter, and presumably devastator are all rockets, but the creepers are grenades. They might not've been hard to use, but a little blurb about them in the menus or a more dedicated tutorial would help. Certainly, the tutorial helps you move around, but it doesn't teach you much about the weapons or the objectives. I personally had no idea what the reactor was, or how to destroy it when I tried that mode, and though I found and killed it by trial and error (And luckily found the emergency exit BEFORE I messed with the reactor) I wasn't sure if I was supposed to just blast away or do something nuanced, like shoot at the 'eye'. (PS, the answer is blast away. It's not obvious, since most weapons don't immediately rip it up, but just keep shooting. Or better yet, explosive spam.) It seems like a big problem, but again, it ought to be an easy fix.\n\nThe neutral:\nThis game is definitely better with a gamepad. Just be ready to mess with your bindings, I personally found X/A to rotate and LT/LB to raise/lower to be a bit weird, and I honestly need to swap it.\n\nVerdict: It's not perfect, and there's some work to be done, but trust me: It's not bad. It's just a quick free demo to show off the mechanics, and it was kinda fun. Slightly disorienting, but fun for sure. Just grab the fun guns and go to town for a few minutes. Would I recommend this if it were a full game? Maybe not. Would I say it's a great demo/teaser, and it's made me intrigued to see how the full game turns out? Hell yes.

This was my first 6DX (I think that's what it's called) game.  I was very pleased with the game and how it played out.  I am very interested to see where this will go from here, but I do see a few faults to the game.  We'll talk about that later.\n\nAlso, before we get into the review, the buttons on the mouse sensitivity options don't work (had to use keyboard).\n\nPros:\n\n-Fun\n-DOOM-esque atmosphere (I like)\n-DOOM-esque gameplay elements such as health and weapon pickups (works to the game's advantage)\n-Good weapon variety for what we were given\n-Solid gameplay\n-Interesting enemy variety\n\nCons:\n\n-Confusing map layout\n-Music tends to repeat and sound the same (no offense to the composer)\n-Doesn't really seem to matter if you roll around.  It's more advantageous to stay in one position and don't use Q or E (default)\n-Enemies look the same with the exception of the asshole with the sawblade (NERF PLOX, DPS TOO HIGH)\n-No real manuverability options other than moving side to side and up and down.\n-Feels...repetitive and like I don't have a real goal (I forgot what I was doing in \"Reactor Destroy\").\n-Floaty camera movement.  It's weird as fuck.\n\nOpinions and Suggestions:\n\n-Art style doesn't seem to fit the current mood of the game.  Given what I just played, I feel like a more simplistic art style might have worked better for this sort of game, though it's up to you.  I enjoy what I got.\n-Minimap.  Doesn't have to display enemies and it doesn't have to be highly detailed.  A top-down view of a grid based map would be alright with me.\n-Less claustrophobic spaces please.\n-The DOOM music fits the CURRENT mood of the game, but I'd like a little bit more variety rather than just techno all the way through.  May I suggest either a rock or orchestra (if you can afford it of course) cover during boss battles?\n-Speaking of boss battles, if you don't think your game is going to be memorable, I suggest making crazy-awesome boss fights.  Something like how Metal Gear Rising Revengence did in their boss fights.  Crazy, over the top, and just plain awesome.  May I suggest: Giant Spaceship with multiple pieces that you have to individually damage that will, over time, break off to reveal a large reactor that you'll have to destroy to beat the boss?\n-A default melee weapon or option would be nice.  DOOM had fists and a chainsaw.  I'd like...oh I don't know, \"ramming\"?  Actually, that sounds pretty useful.  Gives the boost ability a little more strategic worth.\n-Sawblade enemy is an asshole (in a good way).\n-Can combat be a little bit faster?  Seems slow.\n-Hard mouse movement.  I'd like the camera to stop when I stop my mouse.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nIt's a good teaser.  I would rather recommend a complete product though.  I'd tell people to try this game out and see if they like it.  I would also recommend it to people who want to try out this genre.  This would be a good starting point.  It's not crazy difficult but is still hard enough for you to enjoy.\n\nI'm looking forward to the final product.

The feeling is very similar to the Descent Underground, which I also have, and it feels like instead of a ship you are piloting a tank... that can also fly. The action is not nimble, you are not agile and able to dodge bullets, you just move slowly from side to side while silly robots pretend to shoot at you and miss stormtrooper style.

It still falls short of original descents and Sublevel zero or even Retrovirus.

Therefore I am not going to back Overload in its current state, I will only be dissapointed again.\n\nSuggestions for potential improvements:\n\nPlayer ship speed should be higher, ships smaller and bullet size smaller so as to make the player able to dodge incoming bullets or charging robots.

That has become clear to the developer, and is now adapting both what made the original great and bringing modern innovations capable in todays gaming.\n\nBut why am I talking about Doom, when this is not Doom?\nWell, Overload is a perfect example of a developer bringing back what made a game great (Descent) during the same era, and updating it with new innovations.\n\nThey have demonstrated in this demo that they are bringing back the fast paced robot destroying action, with the great 6DOF movement that made the original an instant classic, whilst still embracing the innovations in modern gaming.\n\nThis demo is a prototype build they have currently made before even being funded to actually produce the game. Yet it feels far more polished than you would expect in those circumstances, with far more enjoyment then you would expect.\n\nI recommend having a play of this demo, and see the potential behind this tiny glimse of what this developer is capable of, and if you like what you see go back the game on kickstarter.

The original devs from Parallax (now Revival Productions) have got the band back together and are using their expert knowledge in the genre and the latest tech to bring the excellent 6DOF shooter back to life.\nSo has it been a success? From the playable teaser it's fair to say that, so far, it has been an enormous success. Everything about Overload looks and feels like a modern day Descent. Flying through a hollowed out mining asteroid has brought back so many fond memories of my gaming time back in the 90s, it's allowed me to relive those great experiences, and it's put a smile on my face too many times to count. All from just a short playable teaser.\n\nThe first obvious improvement from the classic games is the graphics. The most notable enhancement is the dynamic lighting. Watching the light emitted from your impulse energy cannon illuminate the nearby walls gives you that 'wow factor', which makes you end up wasting a ton of ammo just to watch the pretty lights. Ooh! Shiny!\n\nEnemy robots explode in a very satisfying manner. The sound of them \"screaming\" as bits of their debris go shooting off in various directions is an audio-visual feast. But before this happens you get to admire hunks of metal armour gradually break off from the enemy bots before you can shoot at their exposed inner workings. A lot of this debris is persistent throughout the level making it feel like a true battlegroud where enemies were actually pitted against one another, and not an uninhabited sterile environment.\n\nEnemy robots are also equipped with a high-powered light that they use to their disadvantage in the pitch black, darkened sections of the asteroid. Why is this to their detriment? Because as the light source shifts from one place to another the way it's cast onto surrounding walls allows you to work out, pretty accurately, the direction and distance of your enemy - without having direct line of sight. Advantage player. Like the explosions this is another feast for the eyes to behold, you have to experience it for yourself.\n\n\nOverall, Overload is a very impressive achievement, but by far the aspect of the game that's most worthy of respect and admiration is the enemy AI. The hostile robots you'll encounter in the asteroid husks are not your typical opponents. Some will just charge straight at you, some will just sit there and aggressively shoot at you with everything they've got, but most (and this is the really good bit) will actually try to dodge your incoming fire. This sense of self-preservation is truly impressive because quite a lot of the time your enemies will succeed in evading your attacks by strafing in the appropriate direction, hiding behind cover, and even running away completely only to reappear a minute later behind you when you suddenly find yourself completely surrounded! In a time where a lot of combat is just point and click or mindless button mashing, this self awareness and teamwork is very much welcomed. You will end up wasting a lot of ammo and/or dying if you're not careful with your tactics.\n\n\nReasons to Support Overload:\n- Incredibly good AI, which will definitely challenge you.\n- Lovely visuals, especially with the dynamic lighting.\n- Classic 'destroy the reactor and then run for your life' mode, and an endless challenge mode.\n- It's Descent, lovingly made by the people who know the 6DOF shooter genre better than anyone else.\n\n\nIn Summary:\n\nBACK THIS ON KICKSTARTER NOW!\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/revivalprod/overload-the-ultimate-six-degree-of-freedom-shoote?ref=nav_search\n\nHappy shooting :)", "timestamp_created": 1457457605, "timestamp_updated": 1457476636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999678", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21711676": {"recommendationid": "21711676", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994048424", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488716909}, "language": "danish", "review": "Descent er tilbage !! og dette spil \" Overload \"  tog mig 28 \u00e5r tilbage til  descent.\nOverload f\u00f8les 100% som Descent !!\n  \nLyd: 100%\nControlflow: 100%\nGrafik: 150% Federe grafik\n\nMange har pr\u00f8vet og genskabe Descent oplevelsen, men for :\n Revival Productions,  lykkedes det over al forventning\nGodt arbejde,  Revival Productions!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1457457416, "timestamp_updated": 1457457416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21711458": {"recommendationid": "21711458", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972659636", "num_games_owned": 1387, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471226150}, "language": "english", "review": "This is exactly what I want to see as a modern iteration of Descent.

Some have been bug-ridden trash, others have been moderately acceptable if lacking polish, and a couple have been well-made but lacking in important features like multiplayer.  But the true look, feel, and pace of the Descent originals have only ever been rivaled by the equally-venerable competitor, Forsaken.  Even the recent entrants to the field, Descent: Underground and Sol Contingency, pay homage to their forebears while not quite adequately delivering the full experience.\n\nAnd along comes Overload, a game on Kickstarter with the intention of doing just that, coded and produced by the same key players that brought us the original Descent franchise... and you can tell.  This game may not carry the same name (because Interplay owns the name), but the look, sound, and feel are all decidedly Descent in every way.\n\nThis is what I've waited for, and it absolutely must be made.  The teaser demo above gives you everything you need to know.  Even in a pre-alpha state, with joystick support almost nonexistent, you can still tell what this is capable of.  If you loved the original games, run (don't walk) to their Kickstarter page and make sure this gets funded.  Right now.\n\nSeriously.  Now.  Go.\n\nEDIT:  Build version 4, which should now be on Steam or will be shortly, fixes all the joystick issues as far as I can tell.\n\nEDIT2:  The Kickstarter got funded!  Keep an eye out in 2017 for the release!  And they've comitted themselves to a multiplayer DLC, so all is right with the world.  See you in the mines.\n\nEDIT3:  It's March of 2017, and on the anniversary of their successful Kickstarter campaign, Revival has released a 2.0 version of their teaser trailer that's positively mouth-watering.  There's not a lot new in terms of level content, but the game runs much better, there's new bots, better AI, and a new HUD that's clearly made to look good and still be VR-friendly.  The company has also notified backers that a Steam Early Access version of the full game will be out later this month, with a few of the levels completed.  Multiplayer is still a ways off, but everything so far continues to give good vibes.

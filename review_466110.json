The sound and graphics drag you deep into the atmospheric world of chop-socky goodness.  A broad selection of superbly realised fighters from different traditions makes every fight a thing of beauty.  Especially with the 70's style filters on :)\n\nControls for all characters are the same, with punch/kick/weapon/dash buttons that are used in conjunction with directional movements, some double button presses, and quarter-circle movements.  This gives you \"soft/normal/hard\" attacks, a throw, and a few other things.  The animation and hitboxes have been lovingly tailored to each individual style, and logical sequences and combos are possible - and different for each fighter.  It all works very well, and feels nice and solid.\n\nIf, as seems to be the case, development is still going on and more bits (More character story?  More fighters to join the current 27?  More modes to join the ones that are already in there?) are going to be added in the future then this should make things even more appealing to any fight fans out there.", "timestamp_created": 1514164226, "timestamp_updated": 1514164226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38592199": {"recommendationid": "38592199", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970519927", "num_games_owned": 525, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 40, "last_played": 1515362064}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm starting to like this game...", "timestamp_created": 1514057565, "timestamp_updated": 1514057565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38557333": {"recommendationid": "38557333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175683381", "num_games_owned": 665, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513994098}, "language": "english", "review": "I honestly didn't know it would be this damn good.

It is not even close to being as enjoyable as DOA 5, Tekken 6, BlazeBlue, or Street Fighter IV.  It has only basic inputs, like 12 total moves for each character, is 2D only, and is not what i consider to be a fighting game on par with the great games like i mentioned already.  \n\nHowever, I love Kung Fu movies alot.  I mean alot.  Love the importance of scenery, love the stereotypes Kung Fu movies all share as standard practice (the village idiot who is always prophetic, the womanizing-good natured friend who always gets injured or dies, the dark art master villans, the Shailon Temple monks who never seem to do the right thing morally, the evil Japanese lord, the rich Chinese merchant who is always showing off and looking like an idiot, the fat chinese man who always wants to start the revolution, the quite yet strong village woman who is the epitome of perfection and never ever is shown in any way other then reverance, the flawed master of kung fu and the wise master who teaches, and even the brazenly loud mouthed, typically huge American who most likely will have killed some lesser known Chinese master before being dealt with by the hero of the movie.  \n\nLove the glimpses of culture, the way they eat, the importance of hierachy and most importantly the kung fu.  \n\nSo i find myself playing this game so i can see some fairly accurate kung fu styles competing against one another.  It is something else seeing a generic Bruce Lee pit his Jet Keen Do against IP Man's Wing Chun or Jackie Chan's drunken fist take on Jet Li's Wushu style.   Other styles include American Karate, Lotus Blossum, Buddhist Palm, Tawainesee Wrestling (think the bad ass villian of all Claude Van Damme movies) and Shaolin.  All charactors are recognizable as the people who made the discipline famous like say Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Donnie Yen, Jet Li, the 70's African American who was a student of Bruce Lees (cannot remember his name now), and some more obscure non mainstream actors circa the 70's that are almost impossible to watch.  \n\nGreatest Kung Fu Movies in my opinion starting with my number one favorite.\n\n1 - Fist of Legend (Jet Li)\n2 - Kung Fu Hustle (Stephen Chow)\n3 - Tai Chi Master (Jet Li)\n4 - House of Flying Daggers (Ziyi Zhang)\n5 - IP Man 2 (Donnie Yen)\n6 - IP Man (Donnie Yen)\n7 - Enter the Dragon (Bruce Lee)\n8 - Grand Master (Ziyi Zhang)\n9 - Fearless (Jet Li)\n10 - Azumi (Ava Ueto)\n\nThe only thing missing in the game is a Tommie Ja (Ong Bach, The Protector).  \n\nShaolin vs Wutang gets a solid 7 out of 10 only cause i am such a dork.

All the basic moves are availabe in an in game help screen and very useful. \n\nGRAPHICS :\nThere is a basic graphics level screen with a low to high pc scale setting and resolution, and a more advanced settings screen for those who want to poke around and customize. There is also one grahical setting \"Battle Damage\" in the games settings screen which I recommend turning off if your fights lag.\n\nDIFFICULTY\n\nOPPONENTS:\nThere are five difficulty levels for all game modes  and a customizable handicap for certain non-arcade modes. \n\nLEARNING CURVE FOR MOVES:\nYou can watch the ai characters  play on any difficulty level to learn moves that aren't in the help screen. There is a completely customizable training mode where you can try out your character's moves against a customizable ai opponent (either stands still, does a certain move or fights). All the moves that aren't documented in game are easily and intuitively learnable in the training mode. There is also a lot of documentation of moves and combos in the steam thread. This has become my favoirte fighting game of all time because the system is so intuitive and well designed. \n\n\nGAMEPLAY CUSTOMIZATION (REPLAY VALUE)\nThe difficulty level ramps up as your skill improves which, combined with the different play modes ensures many hours of fun replay even after new content stops being added (as of this post new content, happily, appears to still be in the works).\n\nCOMMUNITY & DEV SUPPORT\n Apart from the  stream of new and relevant content, the user community is friendly and the developer is diligent in answering new questions and patient with newbies..", "timestamp_created": 1508026692, "timestamp_updated": 1508026692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573460", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35189167": {"recommendationid": "35189167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084094637", "num_games_owned": 443, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509581318}, "language": "english", "review": "Holy crap thank you this game is incredible so far, and obvious work of passion!", "timestamp_created": 1506281640, "timestamp_updated": 1506281640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35170089": {"recommendationid": "35170089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105204612", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510412051}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f3a\u70c8\u5b89\u5229\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1506224896, "timestamp_updated": 1506224896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487487", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35032948": {"recommendationid": "35032948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159826794", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505684117}, "language": "english", "review": "This game when I first saw footage of it, got me excited like the golden era fighters, it really feels like that.

The first hour was me laughing like a maniac as the game flooded my senses with martials arts movie themes. This is a fun kung fu fighting game which delivers all of the movie nostaligia from martial arts cinema. An impressive variety of kung fu styles are represented by unbespoke characters who slightly resemble certain people of fame in a related industry.\n\nThe controls are quite basic - using an XBox One controller there is no function for the triggers or LB/RB buttons. The game played fine on my ageing i7 + 980GTX + SSD system with graphics cranked up to max.\n\nBackgrounds and character details are lushious with martial arts postures of each character tuned to very fine detail. The music also draws you in again bringing that nostalgia right back again. \n\nI also love the fact that the character design isn't exaggerated. There's no excessive and obtrusive boob wobble on the female characters. All characters are as if they were pulled straight out of their respective movies when at their peak.\n\nI would have liked to have seen more variety of combos for each character but this game already ticks so many boxes in my childhood martial arts fighting game wish list I can live with the foibles in this incredibly affordable and entertaining game. \n\nThe game is best played with a controller though apparently it is possible to play using keyboard controls. Good luck executing combos that way though.\n\nAt the time of writing this I am about 7 characters into completing the game with each character and the only reason I stopped is because I need to rest my thumbs...and sleep...and work the next day. Yeah, they're kind of important.\n\nDespite it not being a complex game I will likely keep coming back to it long after I've completed the achievements. Probably the most fun game grinding experience I've had in a while.\n\nIf you're a martial arts fan/movie buff, particularly Hong Kong cinema, this is definitely worth your consideration and as good a reason as any to go and buy a controller.", "timestamp_created": 1501168556, "timestamp_updated": 1501168556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608134", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33820892": {"recommendationid": "33820892", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985697856", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501254706}, "language": "english", "review": "It is bloody brilliant!\n\nLOVE the 70's film feel.", "timestamp_created": 1501115557, "timestamp_updated": 1501115557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497525", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33818856": {"recommendationid": "33818856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028015450", "num_games_owned": 1148, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510676742}, "language": "english", "review": "As a fighting game player since around 1991 and also as a fan of old and new martial art movies I can totally recommend this game.\n\nIt is no Street Fighter or Tekken and not half as deep as them but it is a damn fun experience.\n\nIts fun alone and also with friends and very easy to learn.\n\nIts graphics are good, the music more fitting than the dubstep in Tekken 7 :P\n\nIf the developer who seems to be a cool person and added multiple new characters, stages and more during the currently around 3 months since I bought the game can work on all features he tries to include before the game leaves Early Acess we have one of the best PC exclusive fighting games here and one of the best hommages to classic martial art movies in any form.\n\nIn numbers I would give this a 75% right now and I believe its easily a 80%+ when it has the single story mode and more fine tuning.", "timestamp_created": 1501106911, "timestamp_updated": 1501106911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437614", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33815793": {"recommendationid": "33815793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042229192", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501181729}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome.

De geluiden en muziek zijn inderdaad uit allerlei oude kung fu films gehaald. Soms een beetje tacky, maar past wel in het hele plaatje. Het leukste detail vind ik dat de personages op de echte lijken uit de films. Zo is Dragon onmiskenbaar de look-a-like van Bruce Lee, En Gordon Liu is Longfist in het spel. Erg leuk. De moves zijn ook goed, zo heeft elk personage zijn eigen moves die precies uit bepaald films zijn waarin deze karakters spelen.

arts films of old. The music and stages together with many unique fighters combine to create a very unique experience unavailable elsewhere in the genre. It comes with the full barrage of game modes expected in a fighter (Arcade, Survival, Team Battle, Training) and a Tournament mode for extra fun.\n\n   The controls for this game are simple (Punch, Kick, Weapon, Dash) and are easy to string together to create combos in the system using directional modifiers (Ex: P,P,P, --> P, K, K, --> K, <-- K). As nearly all 2D fighters it features quarter circle specials, supers, throws, and blocking by holding back. Where it excels is how easy it is to start doing cool things right away. Unlike its predecessor (Kings of Kung Fu) it is very responsive and you will not find yourself battling against the controls. The AI is very forgiving at easier levels and presents a decent challenge at higher levels.\n\n   If you have ever enjoyed watching martial arts films with stars like Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan, you definitely owe it to yourself to check this gem out. It is a whole lot of fun, especially if you ever get together with a bunch of friends and play the Tournament mode!", "timestamp_created": 1498166726, "timestamp_updated": 1498167535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32380092": {"recommendationid": "32380092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018520768", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "last_played": 1515904347}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

Not an upvote, nor a downvote per se. \n\nIt's not a terrible game, but it's not a great game either. I guess because it is early access this is to be expected. I mainly purchased it because I love classic Kung Fu cinema, and easily get the references in characters, soundtrack, etc... Thought it would be fun to have in my collection and play around with. \n\nIt's actually pretty decent for a 1 man developed game. But if you are looking for a solid fighting game, I'd look elsewhere for something with more polish. This one is just passable right now. It still needs a lot of tweaking and balance. And since it is just a 1 man team, I'm sure this will be a slow process. \n\nAs of the time of writing this you have a decent sized roster of combatants, with single and offline multiplayer, and a decent selection of stages and a few modes of traditional play. \n\nWhere the game is having issues though that I hope might be tweaked would be the stiffness of moves, lack of diversity in pulling off secials, and other minor annoyances. Every character I have tried has the same list of required inputs to pull off specials, which all stem from quarter circle moves. No variety. There are also throw moves, and \"supers\" which are earned when filling up a meter. The \"super\" moves are all short in animation, and all performed the same way. This really gives the player zero incentive to practice the exeuction of moves for every character. I hope this is something that is fixed later on. \n\nIn any case, I do love the homage to classic Kung Fu cinema. You have a good roster of fighters featuring mock ups from various movies including characters like Pai Mei, Beggar Su, The Drunken Master, Bruce Lee, and many others. Each with their own fighting style that I hope is expanded upon. \n\nBottom line, if you like classic Kung Fu movies in the vein of Shaw Brothers, Golden Harvest and others, give this one a look. However, if you want a competent fighter to stand up to the likes of the Street Fighter, King of Fighters and Guilty Gear types of games, I'd probably avoid this one.", "timestamp_created": 1493201961, "timestamp_updated": 1493201961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614773", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31370654": {"recommendationid": "31370654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021881646", "num_games_owned": 692, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511973216}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u4e45\u6ca1\u5199\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4e86 \u4f46\u8fd9\u90e8\u6e38\u620f\u771f\u7684\u628a\u6211\u60ca\u8273\u5230\u4e86\n\n\u5c11\u6797\u4e0e\u6b66\u5f53\n\u8d77\u521d\u5bf9\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u5e76\u4e0d\u62b1\u6709\u592a\u5927\u7684\u671f\u671b\uff0c\n\u6bd5\u7adf\u4ed6\u7684\u524d\u8f88\u3010\u529f\u592b\u4e4b\u738b\u3011\u6709\u7740\u592a\u591a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u5730\u65b9\n\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4f4d\u56fd\u5916\u5f00\u53d1\u8005 \u80fd\u505a\u51fa\u4e2d\u56fd\u529f\u592b\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u503c\u5f97\u4f69\u670d\n\u800c\u4e14\u672c\u4f5c\u7684\u7d20\u8d28\u7edd\u5bf9\u53ef\u4ee5\u79f0\u8d5e\n\n\u6e38\u620f\u89d2\u8272\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u591a\u4f46\u90fd\u4ee5\u5f88\u591a\u529f\u592b\u660e\u661f\u4e3a\u539f\u578b\u6240\u523b\u753b \n\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0d\u6b62\u4e00\u4e2a\u6863\u6b21 \u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u7684\u4e5f\u5f88\u5230\u4f4d \u53f6\u95ee \u674e\u5c0f\u9f99 \u592a\u5e05\u4e86\uff01\uff01\uff01\n\u53ef\u80fd\u6d89\u53ca\u7248\u6743 \u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u7528\u540d\u5b57 \u800c\u662f\u6c38\u6625 \u9f99\u4e4b\u7c7b\u7684\u79f0\u547c \u5f88\u662f\u53ef\u60dc\u3002\nFTG\u6700\u6ce8\u91cd\u7684\u662f\u6253\u51fb\u611f \u8fd9\u4e00\u4f5c\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u5f97\u5f88\u5230\u4f4d \n\u62f3\u811a\u6b66\u5668 \u90fd\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u62db\u5f0f \u4f46\u5e76\u4e0d\u597d\u533a\u5206 \n\u51fa\u62db\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e8e \u771f\u4eba\u5feb\u6253 \u6211\u6700\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u4e24\u6b3eFTG\u6e38\u620f\nBGM\u65b9\u9762\u4e00\u9996\u9ec4\u98de\u9e3f\u7b80\u76f4\u8ba9\u6211\u6d41\u4e0b\u773c\u6cea \u5f88\u5e26\u611f\n\u800c\u4e14\u4e0a\u624b\u96be\u5ea6\u8f83\u524d\u4f5c\u4f4e\u4e86\u5f88\u591a \u968f\u4fbf\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u6253\u51fa\u8fde\u62db \u6210\u5c31\u611f\u7206\u68da\n\u683c\u6597\u573a\u666f\u4e5f\u5f88\u8d70\u5fc3 \u706b\u70e7\u5c11\u6797\u5927\u8d5e \u4e0d\u8fc7\u6709\u4e9b\u6389\u5e27 \n\u7565\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u5c31\u662f\u8df3\u8dc3\u4f1a\u8d85\u51fa\u5c4f\u5e55 \u5e0c\u671b\u53ef\u4ee5\u62c9\u8fdc\u573a\u666f \u6216\u8005\u8c03\u6574\u8df3\u8dc3\u9ad8\u5ea6\n\n\u503c\u5f97\u4e00\u63d0\u7684\u4eae\u70b9\uff1a\n\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4e9b\u62db\u5f0f\u81ea\u5e26\u4e2d\u6587\u8bed\u97f3\uff01\uff01\uff01\n\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762 \u672c\u4f5c\u7684\u683c\u6321\u4e0d\u662f\u5f53\u7eaf\u7684\u4e0d\u52a8 \u4f1a\u6709\u8eb2\u95ea\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c \n\u7535\u5f71\u53f6\u95ee \u970d\u5143\u7532 \u65e2\u89c6\u611f \u5927\u8d5e\uff01\uff01\uff01\n\n\u6e38\u620f\u4f9d\u7136\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d \u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u5df2\u7ecf\u8d85\u51fa\u4e86\u6211\u9884\u671f\n\u6e38\u620f\u89d2\u8272\u5728\u4e0d\u65ad\u5730\u589e\u52a0 \u76ee\u524d\u52a0\u5165\u4e86\u534a\u4e2d\u6587\n\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005 \u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4f18\u5316 \u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u529f\u592b\u89d2\u8272\n\n\u5341\u5206\u63a8\u8350\u672c\u4f5c\u7ed9\u529f\u592b\u7247\u7231\u597d\u8005\u548c\u683c\u6597\u7231\u597d\u8005 \u60c5\u6000 \n\u771f\u7684\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u591a\u5f97\u4f73\u4f5c  \u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7ee7\u7eed\u52aa\u529b", "timestamp_created": 1493187816, "timestamp_updated": 1493187816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.748453", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31367344": {"recommendationid": "31367344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097126820", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493628970}, "language": "schinese", "review": "Very fantansitc.

And O!M!G! the dodging and blocking!\n\n3. COMBAT SYSTEM: Better combo system, more controllable.\n\n4. UI: Simplified Chinese!\n\nCons:\n1. GRAPHIC: Some models have better modeling than some others. Especially SHAOLIN characters. Generally Light effect on models in darker stages are better. Sometimes there could be rendering error in some stages.(While playing in Jade Bridge stage, the boats were spinning XD)\n\n2.ANIMATION: Could do better in jumping animation.\n\n3.COMBAT SYSTEM: COMBO became almost the same for every character. Light->Medium->Special. However, this game doesn't need to be like the other traditional FTG.\n\n4.UI: Still some english text in simplified Chinese UI.\n\n5. OTHERS: I think developers must know what SHAOLIN and WUTANG are. Maybe there could be some explaination that the characters are fighting for SHAOLIN or WUDANG?  \"WUSHU\" Jet Li is actually using mixed kungfu but his reputation mainly came from \"\u6d2a\u62f3\" and \"\u65e0\u5f71\u811a\".\n\n6.

Et ma foi, je ne regrette pas de lui avoir l\u00e2ch\u00e9 cette poign\u00e9e d'euros. \n\nPoss\u00e9dant d\u00e9j\u00e0 [i]\"Kings of Kung-Fu\"[/i] (jeu pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent du m\u00eame d\u00e9veloppeur [i]Jae-Lee[/i]), difficile de ne pas les comparer tant le propos et la r\u00e9alisation des deux jeux semblent en tous points similaires au 1er abord... Y compris dans certains de leurs d\u00e9fauts. C'est parfois tellement identique qu'on pourrait presque parler d'un \"Kings of Kung-Fu 2\". Mais heureusement, ce [i]Shaolin vs Wutang[/i] me semble beaucoup plus abouti et mieux finalis\u00e9 que son a\u00een\u00e9 - qui n'\u00e9tait probablement qu'un brouillon d'essai... \n\nLe gameplay utilise uniquement les 4 boutons de fa\u00e7ade + le stick (ou la croix) directionnel(le). Je n'ai personnellement jou\u00e9 qu'au Pad 360 - m\u00eame si il est apparemment possible de jouer au clavier.\nChaque personnage dispose naturellement d'un bouton \"punch\" et \"kick\" d\u00e9clinable en puissance l\u00e9g\u00e8re, moyenne ou forte, en fonction de l'orientation du stick. (+ une traditionnelle chope).\n\nNouveaut\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 l'opus pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent : Chacun dispose d\u00e9sormais aussi d'une arme propre \u00e0 son style, utilisable avec un 3e bouton (et variant \u00e9galement ses combos en fonction des manipulations du stick).\nLa 4e touche est \u00e9trangement d\u00e9di\u00e9e aux d\u00e9placements rapides (roulades avant, flip arri\u00e8re, et pour passer dans le dos de l'adversaire) - la parade quant \u00e0 elle s\u2019ex\u00e9cute en maintenant le stick en position arri\u00e8re, comme dans les Street Fighter.\n\nAutre emprunt \u00e0 la franchise de Capcom: Des coups sp\u00e9ciaux styl\u00e9s et efficaces sortiront avec des quarts de cercles avant ou arri\u00e8re. (Mais fort heureusement, toujours pas de boules de feu ni rien de \"surnaturel\" - ce qui permet de bien respecter l'esprit des films auxquels le jeu rend hommage.)\nDe plus, une nouvelle jauge fait son apparition, qui, une fois remplie (\u00e0 force de prendre des baffes ou d'en distribuer), permettra d'enclencher un mouvement d'attaque sp\u00e9cial sctipt\u00e9 (un peu comme les \"Ultras\" dans S.F.4), tandis qu'une autre combinaison de boutons permettra aussi d'user d'un \"combo braker\", utilisant cette m\u00eame jauge.\n\nGlobalement, tout sort relativement bien et facilement, \u00e0 quelques rares exceptions pr\u00e8s. Ce gameplay 2D simple fonctionne, et s'av\u00e8re tr\u00e8s vite assimilable pour encha\u00eener les (nombreux) combats du mode arcade. Pr\u00e9cision : Le jeu ne dispose que d'un versus LOCAL uniquement - PAS de versus online. D'autres modes sont cependant disponibles : training, survival, team battle, tournament.\n\nLe jeu propose d'incarner 19 personnages, tous issus de films de kung-fu asiatiques cultes des ann\u00e9es 70/80. (On fermera les yeux sur la pr\u00e9sence bienvenue de Ip Man dans ce rooster, bien qu'il soit anachronique, puisque le 1er film avec Donnie Yen - ici clairement repr\u00e9sent\u00e9, date de 2008).\nSi comme moi votre enfance/adolescence a \u00e9t\u00e9 berc\u00e9e par la douce violence de ces productions Hong-kongaises, c'est avec grand plaisir que vous retrouvez divers protagonistes tr\u00e8s fid\u00e8lement mod\u00e9lis\u00e9s, jusque dans leur costumes... Siu Tien Yuen et Hwang Jang-Lee sont identiques \u00e0 leurs personnages dans \"Snake in the Eagle's shadow\", Bruce est l\u00e0, sortant de temps en temps un coup sifflant de nunchaku, et Jackie picolera sa bouteille de jaja toujours bien \u00e0 l'aise en impr\u00e9visible Drunken Master. Si on peut regretter l\u2019absence de \"pointures\" comme Sammo Hung, le casting est d\u00e9j\u00e0 tr\u00e8s bien fourni.\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 r\u00e9alisation, les animations sont extr\u00eamement fluides et fid\u00e8les aux styles de combats repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, c'est un vrai bonheur de les voir s\u2019encha\u00eener de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s naturelle.\nMais graphiquement, les similitudes sautent aux yeux avec \"Kings of Kung-fu\". Si le jeu est en net progr\u00e8s sur le plan esth\u00e9tique, les d\u00e9cors restent cependant in\u00e9gaux - certains \u00e9tant nettement plus r\u00e9ussis que les autres. Mais la mod\u00e9lisation des personnages est plus propre et travaill\u00e9e, et on sent un certaine volont\u00e9 d'am\u00e9lioration par de petits d\u00e9tails - comme l'int\u00e9gration d'objets cassables dans le d\u00e9cor par exemple...\n\nBel effort \u00e9galement sur les bruitages et les musiques, une fois de plus \u00e9tonnamment fid\u00e8les \u00e0 celles des films repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s! [i](J'\u00e9cris \"\u00e9tonnamment\", car je m'interroge vraiment sur la question des \"droits\" pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment relatifs \u00e0 ces musiques, \u00e0 ces films, ou \u00e0 l'image de ces acteurs qu'on reconna\u00eet imm\u00e9diatement, qui me paraissent utilis\u00e9s compl\u00e8tement ill\u00e9galement par ce minuscule studio ind\u00e9... Mais bon ; je ne vais pas m'en plaindre).[/i]\n\nL'interface en revanche reste absolument ignoble : image de biblioth\u00e8que hideuse, menus bien tartignoles de l'\u00e9cran titre aux options, en passant par les typos un peu pourries... Le design est vraiment pauvre de ce c\u00f4t\u00e9 l\u00e0.\n(Puisqu'on en parle, les options sont relativement modestes mais proposent l'essentiel, notamment une liste des mouvements plut\u00f4t bien faite et illustr\u00e9e aux couleurs des boutons du pad 360 : plut\u00f4t cool).\n\nOn peut aussi lui reprocher quelques bugs, quelques ralentissements, son temps de chargement initial un poil longuet, le mix de certains bruitages trop forts par rapports aux autres (ceux des objets qui se cassent), des succ\u00e8s \u00e0 la con (genre \"gagner 100 combats versus d'affil\u00e9e\"), ainsi que l'\u00e9quilibrage chelou de certaines attaques...\nPar exemple le ratio auquel les coups remplissent la jauge de \"sp\u00e9cial\" adverse en fonction des faibles d\u00e9g\u00e2ts distribu\u00e9s - parfois tr\u00e8s d\u00e9savantageux - ou les pr\u00e9cieux \"Ultras\" qu'on imagine d\u00e9vastateurs, alors qu'ils ne font parfois pas tellement plus mal qu'une attaque forte, ou encore, certains coups sp\u00e9ciaux en quarts de cercle qui ne sont pas dispo partout chez certains persos, alors que la liste de coups (commune \u00e0 tous) pr\u00e9tend le contraire.\nDonc clairement, le jeu est loin d'\u00eatre parfait, mais on y prend quand m\u00eame plaisir, et dans la mesure o\u00f9 il est encore en acc\u00e8s anticip\u00e9, tout \u00e7a me semble relativement pardonnable.\n\nBref, en l'\u00e9tat, ce [i]Shaolin vs Wutang[/i] est un peu comme un tr\u00e8s vieux fantasme sorti de l'enfance qui se r\u00e9alise, rendant agr\u00e9ablement jouables et affrontables un bon nombre des idoles que je r\u00eavais d\u00e9raisonnablement de voir un jour r\u00e9unies dans un m\u00eame jeu vid\u00e9o! Et d\u00e9sormais, \u00e9tonnamment, ce jeu (certainement tr\u00e8s d\u00e9complex\u00e9 sur le plan l\u00e9gal) existe bel et bien... Et pour un prix tr\u00e8s abordable qui plus est, compte tenu de son g\u00e9n\u00e9reux contenu, et de sa r\u00e9alisation assez honn\u00eate \u00e0 ce tarif.\nJe le recommande donc sans h\u00e9siter aux amateurs de vieux films de Kung-Fu, qui malgr\u00e9 le tr\u00e8s l\u00e9ger fumet d'amateurisme parfois bien perceptible, y trouveront quand m\u00eame un gigantesque fan service assez inesp\u00e9r\u00e9.", "timestamp_created": 1485628192, "timestamp_updated": 1485676772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.689737", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29543468": {"recommendationid": "29543468", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979187815", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485863867}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome Sound track\nFun gameplay\nLegendary characters \nRating 8/10\n \nA must own for any fan of old kung fu movies.

I feel that a story mode would be a GREAT addition to the game in many ways. Among other it would make the characters feel more alive and have greater nostalgia value for the diehard Kung Fu movie fans out there.\n\nThe game is nice and fun, characters have different fighting styles. In many ways it reminds me of the old 90s 2D fighting games like Mortal Kombat 3, only that the controls are much more simplistic and the fighting is more realistic (don't expect supernatural abilitys). The special moves have the same key combinations for all the characters, which for me is a good thing. The game is very simple and casual player friendly.

The music, sound effects, and the recognizable fighters will probably appeal more to older player than younger ones as they may not be familiar with the movies referenced here.\nThe fighting is pretty good.  It's definitely more of a throwback to early 90's fighting games that today's with all the goofy meters and special moves.  It reminds me a bit of Tekken's control scheme but not quite as fluid.  It could use some refining and definitely some more moves.  The music and sounds are mostly great and I like the graphical style.  It's definitely worth more than the price for me as a fan of old Kung-Fu films.  I hope this game continued support and a sequel down the line.

Where the first film was a playful nod at the Hollywood interpretation of the genre, this goes traditional, with a focus on some of the iconic characters and styles that populated Shaw Brothers and Golden Harvest films since the 60s (saw one reviewer said the 70s, um, you're off a decade - \"Come Drink With Me\" for example [the spiritual successor to Crouching Tiger and part of the Golden Swallow series]  1966 but some of the first of these films go back to 1949, with movies like \"The True Story of Wong Fei-hung\".) \n\nEnough history lesson, now about the game. Shaolin vs. WuTang shows several improvements over Kings of Kung Fu. The controls feel tighter and more responsive, each combatant has an \"authentic\" weapon associated with the combatant's style of fighting (or in the case of the Silver beared  master [think Pai Mei]) true to the nature of the character protrayed in films. The graphics show a huge improvement over Kings of Kung Fu, which, honestly released only a year ago, shows Jae Lee and his team are getting better. Like KOKF, all the moves are authentic, well animated and with the added bonus of slow motion special effects and a righteous ripped from Hong Kong cinema soundtrack.\n\nSomeone complained about the lack of tutorial, and that's a rubbish complaint. Some of the best fighting games didn't have no stinking tutorials. You got a move list card and had to discover and figure it out yourself. Maybe I am showing my age, but have IQs dropped sharply while I was away? You don't need no stinking tutorial, there is a practice mode to hone your chops with and like Street Fighter 2 or Tekken 2, you are thrust into match after match with some character appropriate pre-match banter from the combatants. IMHO, the new frills, clean and focus on fighting is welcome, and if you need a hand holding tutorial, maybe you should go play a Pokemon game or something. FFS.\n\nI am going to be playing this a lot, and look forward to more updates with added stages.

As a big fan of the good old martial arts movie classics, I instantly had to buy it when I found out about Shaolin vs Wutang. \n\nThe art style is just beautiful, incredibly well done, and when looking at the characters (18 in total and more to come) and their specific Kung Fu styles, I feel like being in one of those kick-\u2665\u2665\u2665 flicks I loved to watch as a kid and now as an adult. And come on, who didn't wish to be able to fight like that? Now here is your chance. Amazing moves are available, worthy of the Golden Harvest era. \n\nEach and every fighter offers distinctive punches, kicks, and -what's kinda new- also Kung Fu weapons, representing their fraction and style. Of course there are standard & special attacks and combos. \n\nPrecision, distance and timing are rewarded, because you can try to go with spamming buttons, but you'll soon find limits then, especially on higher difficulties. Though there are not that many moves per fighter as in Kings of Kung Fu - which had a ton (also totally worth to get, btw) made by the same dev (nice guy, working hard to even increase the SvW's experience by cool updates), - there are enough, and along with the special attacks a tad easier to pull off, hence a bit less hard to master, but naturally you have to use them wisley to become an real expert in the fantastic arts of Shaolin and Wutang. ;)\n\nIf you love Kung Fu, Kung Fu movies and or just superb fighting games with great looking graphics, this game is for you.\n\nEdit: This amazing game gets even better and better - not only with each update - the more you play the less you can't stop, that great are the moves and combos you can use. A real treat. \n\nIt also made me rewatch Ip Man 2, Snake In The Eagle's Shadow, and Drunken Master will be next.

I love the diverse character selection regarding to their martial arts style as homage to the movies like Donnie Yen's Wing Chun and Jackie Chan's Drunken Fist. The game runs pretty smooth and the controls are fluid. Two problems I have with the game is the background music and the selection features. The music is great, but the background music needs to have a loop so there wouldn't be an awkward silence with two dudes grunting at each other. The selection features can use a small upgrade so it wouldn't look like I'm playing a flash game, but rather a Triple A game I look forward to play.

Most of the moves made sense as far as advancing and retreating attacks, it punished you harshly for spamming, and you could flow most of the moves together into free form combos. \n Shaolin V Wutang however is a huge step back from Kings of Kung Fu. The flow is akward, there is no quick step, all of the moves don't flow into eachother. The left/right system is swapped out for a kick, punch, weapon, roll system(the telegraphed roll, being the only way to change up range quickly). All of this combined makes for a low tempo, stand and combo kind of fighting system.

The only thing that would make it better is if they hit up the RZA to do a DLC soundtrack.\n\nThe fighter models look fairly simple, but any wuxia film fan will recognize the faces of each style-represented model. Among the few include Jackie, Gordon, Bruce and some older school faves I won't spoil.\n\nThe game is quite fun to play...I had a few things to pick up around the house, but insisted on running through the game with Lotus Palm after losing horribly as my boy reppin' the Shaolin long fist. I'd like to see a custom fighter option in the full release as the character roster is only a handfull at this time.\n\nSome costume swaps would be cool, in addition to some more faves:\n\n- Hung Gar Donnie Yen \n- Tai Chi via Jet Li (Twin warriors alt Tai Chi master)\n- More from the 5 Deadly Venoms\n- Perhaps a represented Michelle Yeoh\n- DAVID LO PAN (Big Trouble)\n\nI will keep checking for updates...but any fan of kungfu flicks and fighters should get some fun out of this. \nFor a pre-release however, I'd like to see the price drop a little.\n\n-Flu\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1467864108, "timestamp_updated": 1467864108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516796", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24086014": {"recommendationid": "24086014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046813543", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468755006}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u4e0a\u624b\u5c31\u4f1a\u559c\u6b22\u4e0a\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff01\n\u5145\u6ee1\u5c4f\u5e55\u7684\u5c0f\u7ec6\u8282\u8ba9\u4eba\u611f\u52a8\uff0c\u6a21\u4eff\u5609\u79be\u7684loading\u5f00\u573a\uff1b70\u5e74\u4ee3\u90b5\u6c0f\u98ce\u683c\u7684BGM\u4e0e\u914d\u97f3...\n\n\n\u4f18\u70b9\u5982\u4e0b\u3002\nA. \u6253\u51fb\u611f\uff0c\u6253\u51fb\u611f\u73b0\u5728\u6709\u70b9\u6f02\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u62db\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u5904\u7406\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u597d\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u6e38\u620f\u66f4\u6709\u624e\u5b9e\u7684\u6253\u51fb\u611f\u3002\nB. \u52a8\u4f5c\u8fd8\u539f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6b66\u6253\u53ca\u4eba\u7269\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fd8\u539f\u7684\u7279\u522b\u50cf\u7535\u5f71\u4e2d\u7684\uff0c\u73a9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u6c89\u6d78\u611f\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u3002\nC. \u6613\u4e0a\u624b\uff0c\u62db\u5f0f\u7279\u522b\u7b80\u5355\u6613\u5b66\uff0c\u683c\u6597\u6e38\u620f\u82e6\u624b\u4e5f\u5f88\u5feb\u638c\u63e1\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u5c31\u80fd\u6253\u51fa\u4e00\u5927\u6bb5\u8fde\u51fb\uff0c\u4e0a\u624b\u5f88\u5feb\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u611f\u89c9\u76f8\u5f53\u597d\u3002\n\n\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u4fe1\u5f88\u5feb\u5c31\u4f1a\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u3002\n\nA. \u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u4f30\u8ba1\u73b0\u5728\u8fd8\u6ca1\u4f18\u5316\u597d\u3002\nB. \u4eba\u7269\u5e73\u8861\u4e0a\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\u5427\u3002\nC. \u52a0\u5165\u6545\u4e8b\u60c5\u8282\u5427\uff01\u8fd9\u6837\u5c31\u592a\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1467651184, "timestamp_updated": 1467651184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24064865": {"recommendationid": "24064865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291355143", "num_games_owned": 669, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467246434}, "language": "english", "review": "Smoooooth do you know smooooth?", "timestamp_created": 1467589242, "timestamp_updated": 1467589242, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.335704", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24063076": {"recommendationid": "24063076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044742042", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497829040}, "language": "english", "review": "these game is everything I could ask for in a kung fu fighting title.

(A real kong fu master can use several type of weapons, and most of the time weapon will only fight with weapon)\n\nJust start playing, if I had missed up something please forgive me.

I'm a huge fan of the old Chinese martial arts films and so naturally, I want to try this game out and after a while of playing, I was very impressed with the level of authenticity with the character models and the levels in the game. I truly hope the developer will keep adding to this one...\n\nThe graphics for this game really grabbed me, especially the feel of the old movies that I grew up watching... just turn on the movie effect and you are pretty close to watching the movie, especially on stages like Waterfall. I almost just want to stand there an admire the details. If you are on a stronger machine, you can turn on everything and truly experience the game.\n\nThe character models all feel familiar. I instantly recognised the influences for the character, especially The Dragon and White Brow, with his signature smug pose. I almost wanted him to laugh at me as he was whupping my ass, just like the movies. The animation at times feels very fluid during the fight and each strike and kick feels and sounds just like the movies, but I wish there were more moves for these guys and a movelist for each character. I had to figure out the moves at first but after a round, I caught on quickly. On the other hand, there is a little stiffness with some of the movements but I am sure after an update, it will be fixed. \n\nIn closing of this review, the developer has put a lot of love and energy into creating a game that feels like the genuine article. And as a fan of martial arts, I deeply appreciate the love and care that has been taken to create interesting characters and picturesque environment (Btw, the market stage is pretty cool too. The dog doesn't even know the fight is going on, lol), and it just grabs you. If you have played the previous entry, Kings of Kung Fu, you will definitely love this one... #TeamWutang", "timestamp_created": 1462975232, "timestamp_updated": 1462975232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22910712": {"recommendationid": "22910712", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088621279", "num_games_owned": 1109, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462972760}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0444\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0433 \u0441 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043a\u0443\u043d\u0433-\u0444\u0443\n\u0412\u0441\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043c\u044b \u0438\u0437 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u0443\u043d\u0433-\u0444\u0443\n\u0412 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u043a\u0443\u043d\u0433-\u0444\u0443 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u043e\u0432\n\u0412\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043c \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0443 , \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0430", "timestamp_created": 1462972949, "timestamp_updated": 1462972949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479658", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22906613": {"recommendationid": "22906613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268039911", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476999645}, "language": "english", "review": "From a die hard SNK fan if you want casual fighter's that are fun with impressive graphics priced well and want to spend your money on some Devs that seem to care more about their product then how much DLC they can suck your from your wallet, then these titles are probably for you.", "timestamp_created": 1462944693, "timestamp_updated": 1463110950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22906492": {"recommendationid": "22906492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131221390", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462944707}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty great needs some work on the graphics so it can run smoother and not be choppy, fighting system could use work but overall great game.

I couldn't believe that for early access there is so much more accomplished here than in Kings of Kung Fu. The dev definitely improved his skill since then and it shows.\n\nThe visuals are absolutely beautiful. Some of the stages just blew me away with the detail that during the fights I found myself focusing more on the environment than the actual fight.\nAdding to the awesome experience, I was really impressed with the music and sound fx. It just adds that much more to the experience making it feel like you are taking part in a 1970's Kung Fu film.\n\nI'm in total shock that this is all done by one dev. I have to take my hat off to him. This is super impressive work.\n\nNow being an early access game I did expect to find some issues in the game. I noticed graphical glitches very rarely appearing throughout the game (sometimes at random or sometimes when changing the graphics settings), I also noticed character clipping when they were too close to each other, and an imbalanced AI fighting system. There were a few other bugs but nothing serious.\n\nClosing this up, all I can say is this game is definitely worth the $$$ and is an experience you should not miss. The dev put a lot of heart into it and as an early access game it's great to be a part of it to watch it get better with the patches and updates.\n\nThis is definitely a game I will be playing quite often.

While its DEFINITELY NOT a game catering to the hardcore FGC crowd, the important tropes that must exist do exist (such as deep jump ins, crossups, pokes, footsies, etc). \n\n'Execution requirements' is not even a thought. The game was never intended to be something you need a bible and 3 years of college to become good at a single character... Its a game where you can pick up and have fun pulling off cool moves. A basic overarching yet simple moveset links everything together and allows you to recreate moments from the old classic kung fu movies which the game takes its inspirations from with very little difficulty. However 'simple' does not mean 'baselessly shallow' like the previous game. This game does have enough depth to it to reward those who absolutely insist on getting the last 20% out of a character, as opposed to simply playing to 80%. Its simple, and yet rewarding.\n\nThe game still has a number of kinks and flaws of course but it IS Early Access.

Han hecho un juego muy sobrio y realista que si ves los movimientos cualquiera puede pensar que alguien con un m\u00ednimo de preparaci\u00f3n e inter\u00e9s puede ejecutarlos, incluso los especiales.\n- No se fliparon metiendo bolas de energ\u00eda, patadas de fuego, elevaciones a 40 metros de una patada o fuegos artificiales cada vez que metes un golpe medio raro, lo cual veo en otros juegos de lucha mucho m\u00e1s populares y eso en el Street Fighter, vale, tiene un pase porque es un poco marca de la casa desde que yo era peque\u00f1o, pero en sitios como Tekken sobran y mucho (Y os lo dice uno que es fan del 7 y le da al online duro). Aqu\u00ed han ido a lo realista y yo me creer\u00eda que las peleas en China puedan ser as\u00ed. \n- Est\u00e1n mimando much\u00edsimo el juego. Yo creo que los desarrolladores saben que no es un juego para todos los p\u00fablicos pero quieren mimar a la gente que hemos mostrado inter\u00e9s en el juego, lo cual, yo como usuario se lo agradezco mucho, como dato: Cuando lo compr\u00e9 iba un poco a ciegas pero me gustaba la tem\u00e1tica. Me encontr\u00e9 20 luchadores (Contando al ninja y al americano) y m\u00e1s bien poco que hacer fuera de un modo arcade que se acababa haciendo un poco largo, pero ahora lo he retomado y me he encontrado 30 luchadores (Ver a gente de capoeira, kickboxing o un ingl\u00e9s claramente inspirado en Chuck Norris es muy refrescante, entre otras novedades), otros tantos escenarios, creo tambi\u00e9n que aumentaron las conversaciones personales (Dependiendo a quien te enfrentes tu luchador le puede dar un trato especial), le pusieron un breve argumento que explica porqu\u00e9 se est\u00e1n dando de palos (El alem\u00e1n del kickboxing me record\u00f3 much\u00edsimo a Jean Claude Van Damme en Contacto Sangriento as\u00ed como su combate final) y en general, no s\u00e9 lo que tienen pensado meter en un futuro. \n\nTambi\u00e9n tiene puntos a mejorar, pero al ser un early access, entiendo que a\u00fan les queda tiempo pero lo est\u00e1n haciendo bien, aunque podr\u00edan mejorar:\n\n- El online: Lo veo un poco cutre plantarte una clasificaci\u00f3n de los mejores y arreando, me imagino que eso lo mejorar\u00e1n poniendo rangos o cualquier otra cosa que le de vidilla.\n- Pocos golpes por luchador. Se me olvid\u00f3 decir que la plantilla de 30 que ahora tiene se aprecian mucho las diferencias entre unos y otros, pero tal vez eso haya ido en detrimento de recortar el repertorio de golpes por cada PJ.\n- Las animaciones si acaso un poco toscas.\n\nResumen: No me arrepiento de haberlo comprado en early access, veo que le est\u00e1n metiendo contenido nuevo y me gustar\u00eda ver lo que sale de ah\u00ed.", "timestamp_created": 1520363405, "timestamp_updated": 1520363405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40602750": {"recommendationid": "40602750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025478832", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520325401}, "language": "english", "review": "The animations are so stiff; worse than Netherrealm fighters.

What does this and Shaolin vs Wutang have in common? Both appear generic at first, but I assure you, don't judge a book by it's cover, because like Deadliest Warrior, despite looking generic at first and having a focus on public domain in regard to characters, it makes suprisingly good use and execution in terms of fighting styles/playstyles and variety when it comes to the characters. Despite the characters not being memorable, they play and feel well and different and are implemented well\n\nNow, let's get to what makes the game fun, but also it's problems\n\n(Bear in mind this was played using a logitech gamepad controller, so it may slightly vary depending on how you play and with what)\n\nShaolin vs Wutang is a fun game overall, but not without it's problems and gripes\n\nWhilst the gameplay is fun and all, the problems I had will also be listed as were the positives/reminders\n\nBalancing-Whilst the game is for the most part balanced I genrally do fairly well at fighting games, and while the challenge is nice, I feel as thouh the game suffers a bit of diffculty problems that Payday 2 has (Payday 2 may be a different game entirely, but just hear me out) as both games have somewhat of a gap issue when it comes to difficulties (to compare, death wish and one down/death sentence have a difficulty gap problem, and in this game that applies to normal and hard, normal is a challenge, but I often had close matches on normal and would almost run out of time during some matches, which is a bit unbalanced, the game is mostly balanced, but could use a tad of fixing\n\nControls-The controls aren't bad, but they aren't great either and it does take reading for this one as well as getting used to. At first glance this may seem like common sense, but when you (meaning people in general) play enough fighters, you can get a basic idea of what the buttons do and how controls work without training and then what you do use training for is to learn intricacies and the ins and outs. Its also not said on how to throw/grab and in turn not how to grab escape. To my knowledge there also isn't a tutorial (correct me if I'm wrong on the no tutorial thing) there is a control list/move list, which does help, but a tutorial to master mechanics and understand how the game plays in depth can help MAJORLY\n\nThe game's controls do work, but I will warn all of you that the game feels and functions better using the ANALOG STICK rather than the D-pad (big letters-emphasis) as you can tell there is less delay on actions, attacks, and movement using the analog stick, which needs to be adressed. Also, jumping can be a bit finicky, sometimes you may jump without moving when you were trying to move to the left or right for example, whilst this isn't a gamebreaker it does need to be adressed\n\n\nMusic-I feel bad that the tracks are licensed from kung fu movies, now before anyone jumps at this point, just hear me out\n\nOn one end I have not seen many kung fu movies, (which I do want to fix) however most of the music aside from maybe 3 tracks are too short and keep looping and are kind of bland and generic, why I feel bad is because the guy behind the game had to pay fees for the music and it wasn't that appealing. I also hope this game in the future doesn't suffer the fate of Alan Wake (which for those that don't know, was removed due to soundtrack licensing expiring, that also can be said for Driver San Francisco for another example) However one element I will give the music credit about is that it's cheesy and generic feel does at least fit well with the game (in other words, this game  is a giant homage to kung fu movies, and these tracks do fit the vibes the game tries to give off)\n\n\nNow, let's get to the positives\n\nRoster-The roster is very varied, fun, and diverse, although the characters may not look that great in design terms as mentined beforehand, each one plays very differently and in fun ways, not to mention more characters are getting added for free via updates, which is generous and a nice touch.\n\nCombat-I like the idea of weapons being mapped to the X button, whilst b and a are for your different attack types (punches and kicks). All the attacks overall flow fairly well. The other elment to keep in mind or make note of is how attack \"weight\" for lack of a better term is handled. Whilst holding back either left or right (depending on which side you are facing) determines your attack type (light medium or heavy) which is not necessarily groundbreaking, but it is different and executed fairly well. The dashing mechanic is also a nice change of pace and can help to give yourself distance or to close distance. Whilst dashing in itself is nothing new for fighters, what is is how it's done, which is by using Y. Some people may like or dislike it, but I personally enjoyed it, it just takes getting used to\n\nChallenge-Despite the minor balancing issues that need to be adressed, the game is overall a good challenge and deffinately will require you to make good use of each fighters different moves and move types and the AI can put you on your feet at times\n\n\nNow lastly, here's the things I would change or \"neutral\" points about the game\n\nLadder Selection-One problem I had was I felt the game lasted a bit too long for one sitting. I personally would either make it so you can save mid ladder (just start back at the postion in arcade mode you were at, just at round one, only losing individual round progress) or take a page from mortal kombat and allow you to pick your ladder length, such as short, medium, large, extra large etc...\n\nDifficulty-This is more so a warning to people, but bear in mind for whatever reason that the game is by default set to HARD (I don't know why) so to fairly judge it/give it a try, you will need to set it to normal, however this does need to be fixed\n\nAlternative Soundtrack-For when the licensing eventually expires, there should be another soundtrack with orignal songs to avoid any issues\n\nOverall, Shaolin vs Wutang does have it's problems and places it needs to be fixed, however you should still keep in mind that where the game succeeds is the most important elments, that being the flow, combat/feel and roster, which imo are the most important elments of a fighting game, and these reasons are why you should give it a try, don't expect anything groundbreaking, but expect something fun, and something different.\n\nHopefully the developer Jae Lee reads this, and my advice to you if you read this Jae, add yourself as a character for kicks/fun, and be sure to update the game/patch it with it's problems and work on alternative music, because tbh the game has potential to be great, it's just currently its slightly above average at its current state", "timestamp_created": 1520165523, "timestamp_updated": 1520165752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40520541": {"recommendationid": "40520541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198420257464", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520380280}, "language": "english", "review": "many characters\n very good music\nflexible combat and more than a dozen interesting stages!!\n arcade mode practise mode \n\n\n\n online in the future I hope !! lookin good so far !", "timestamp_created": 1520029912, "timestamp_updated": 1520035767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40479795": {"recommendationid": "40479795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030692328", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 29, "last_played": 1521234984}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a foot to the face dream come true.

I have only spent 40 some minutes with the game but it is very entertaining and deep enough for a beginner to high level player. Combo creativity is very nice too, the commands aren't linear so you can mix and match any punch or kick provided it is in quick succession in order to make custom combos. I highly recommend this to anyone who has fond memories of old films. The button layout is very Virtua Fighter and Dead or Alive like (1 kick 1 punch 1 weapon)\n\n**TIP for the DEV**\nYou have made a very special game and it is full of potential. One thing that I found to be usefull is if you gave an option or in the near future add extra buttons for weak. medium, strong punch or kicks like Street Fighter. this way you can keep the tap. press right tap, press left tap of each button to have extra variations of the wek medium and strong punches or kicks or weapons.\n\nsome animations like getting up from the ground and jumping are a bit broken, is it posible to add intermediate frames to make the animation smoother? It's not annoying to look at or anything, but I think it would add more quality to the transitions of each move animatino.\n\nThis game reminds me very much of Kensei Sacred Fist, even the block dodges are almost identical. Please continue to build on this game.

The Inital load time is kind of long but not 5-10 minutes long more like 2 minutes. I decided that it would be better to have a longer load at the beginning of the game in order to provide a better experience with shorter load times once you're playing the game. I'll probably change this with a patch soon, so that the Initial first boot up load is shorter, but the in game loading time is slightly longer. Secondly the controls are simplified. The control limitations are a constraint of the engine unfortunately. This game is designed for casual players not hardcore fighting game enthusiast . It's a passion project not a AAA fighting game.\n\nIt is important to note as well that this game is not designed or targeted towards seasoned or hardcore fighting game players. Its designed for Casual fans and mainly fans of martial arts and martial arts films. This was a intentional decision knowing the limitations of the engine im using. Most of my target audience won't know or care about the things that you're focused on like dashing, or defense on wakeup. Trust me my friend if I had the ability to make a fighter using a professional fighting engine I would jump at the opportunity. Hopefully I will have the chance in the future if this little game does well enough.\n\n I appreciate the feedback and your review :)"}, "39965188": {"recommendationid": "39965188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170955655", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518219595}, "language": "english", "review": "great game", "timestamp_created": 1518222051, "timestamp_updated": 1518222051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39954706": {"recommendationid": "39954706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037382064", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518188106}, "language": "english", "review": "Your opponents can't even crouch block!!!

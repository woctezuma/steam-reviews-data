I was first introduced to Falcom games through their incredible Legend of Heroes games and I have always been curious of the Ys franchise for the past couple of years. I figured it was time to stop pondering and take the plunge into Ys Seven, their first 3d Ys title.\n\nAll in all, this game screams Falcom storytelling and action, which is a fantastic thing to behold. It took some time to get used to how the game works since I have been so used to the turn based combat of the Trails series, but once I got the hang of it, it became really fun to play.\n\nPros:\n\nExcellent, fast paced combat.\nGood story that draws you in over time.\nFun characters with interesting and funny dialogue.\nPlenty of combat Skills that offer variaty of ways to fight.\nGood soundtrack, but not even close to the quality of the Kiseki series of soundtracks.\n\nCons:\n\nA lot of grinding to get everything.\nSome environments were annoying to traverse, until you get the item that stops the issue.\n\nIn general, this game does many things right and I am eagerly waiting for Ys 8: Lacrimosa of Dana to make its debut onto PC soon, despite XSEED Games not being the ones helming the game. After playing Ys 7, I may consider going back to play the past Ys titles.

It's quite a bit different from the earlier 3d Ys games, but I wouldn't say this doesn't makes it better or worse, just different.  Unlike the earlier games, Seven tries to add a bit more to the RPG side of the series.  The story is a bit larger and feels quite a bit more serious than in previous games.  There's now party members, various skills for each party member that level up along with them, special EX attacks, more equipment options, loads of accessories with various effects, and a crafting system.  The combat system is also completely different.  Aside from aforementioned skills and EX attacks, certain enemies have certain weaknesses, and attacking them with the wrong type of weapon will make you either deal significantly less damage, or even no damage at all.  Jumping is also gone, putting the fights in mostly 2d setting.  To compensate for the inability to evade through jumping, the game also introduces a roll ability to let you move around faster, and a guard ability to completely block attacks if timed correctly.  Guarding early punishes you by making you take a guaranteed critical hit, while guarding successfully charges your EX attack gauge slightly and gives you a short period of time with 100% critical hit rate.  Despite all these changes though, this doesn't mean the game is easy by any means.  It's certainly got the same challenge as any other game in the series.  Overall it's a great game and I had a blast with it.  The crafting and skill leveling felt like down points for me though.  Farming materials for new weapons and armor can be a bit of a pain, and similarly, spamming a skill a bunch of times to level it up can be a bit of a hassle.  I found these two points sort of distracted me from the rest of the game a bit.  Beyond that though, I can't really say anything bad about this game, it's definitely really great, and the differences from other Ys games sort of give it a fresh new feel.

The thing that makes Y's so addictive in my opinion is the combat. The styles have varied over time, but they are always satisfying. The system has been updated a bit here, for the better in my opinion. It's still just as responsive as ever (major strong point of series), and rivals FPS games in the sheer satisfaction of mowing down enemies.\n\nIf the game upsets you for any reason (Say, fell off a ledge requiring some back tracking), then god help the nearest enemy, because they WILL suffer the wrath of your irritation and after a few satisfying slashes, special skill blasts, followed by a soul-soothing \"RAAAWWRRGGHGHGH\" death cry as the HP hits 0......all will be forgiven as you head back up to continue your quest, mowing down more monsters. Need to grind for a bit? (not really required on normal) No problem, it's a good time!\n\nThe party system is well done and surprisingly does not slow the game down like i thought it might. They have managed to keep things simple enough to retain the core values of the series while expanding the gameplay. \n\nThis installment gives the best feeling of exploration and adventure so far, as the next towns are often a serious trek through various lands that will have you excited to finally get there and check out the next town.\n\nStory is good in this one. It's not going to win any oscars but I found it to be one of the more captivating of the series, with some serious twists and characters that we get know decently. The coliseum was fantastic - i'll leave it at that to avoid any spoilers.\n\nSynthesis - I was worried this would just feel like work, but fortunately it's never holding you back in normal difficulty and more like a bonus area. I used it here and there, and at the end of the game have decided to pursue a few items before i meet my maker, but most of the things you need to create things are just a dungeon crawl away in the place you were headed anyway.\n\ni've heard complaints of backtracking - not really. Yes you revisit some places in the second half, but only to get to brand new areas. This game has no more backtracking than any other self respecting RPG. It's an adventure, and you should get to know the world. RPG's should not be linear, but either way there is really not anything that feels cheap or recycled here, again since you end up in brand new areas as a result of said backtracking, once again marvelling in a new area to conquer.\n\nGraphics are 2nd rate by 2017 standards but still look good and serve the game well. \n\nBosses, while looking good for the era and still as menacing as ever, lack some of the absolutely required strategy of older Y's games. It's a bit easier to button mash away in this installment, probably the biggest set back vs previous Ys games. Still, the bosses are fun battles and if you value your potions you'll need to pay mind to the patterns and do lots of dodging. They are the longest boss battels in the series yet, and if you take the impatient button mashing/potion popper route your thumbs will be begging for mercy half way through the battle - incentive enough to tighten up and start minding the patterns and such....\n\nMusic is excellent as always with Y's games - the boss music always gets me pumped. There are some treats for players of previous games in music dept. The early Y's games have the most memorable music in video gaming - there is nothing on that level here, but for any other series i'd call it excellent.\n\nSpeaking as a fan of the series,  I give this a 9/10. it's affecting my sleep schedule.", "timestamp_created": 1518502560, "timestamp_updated": 1518502694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39960438": {"recommendationid": "39960438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026673593", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516496322}, "language": "english", "review": "Not sure how I feel about having harvest points and skill grinding and item crafting in my Ys; to be honest it feels like it stacks too much on top of a good, basic formula.

Bi dark souls, bi zelda kadar g\u00fczel oynan\u0131\u015f\u0131 var. Bildi\u011fin ya\u011f gibi ak\u0131yor. Sevenda 7 farkl\u0131 karakter var kontrol edebildi\u011fimiz ve bunlar\u0131n \u00fc\u00e7\u00fcn\u00fc ayn\u0131 anda kullanabiliyoruz. Geri kalan d\u00f6rd\u00fcn\u00fc istedi\u011fimiz an men\u00fcden se\u00e7ebiliyoruz. Karakterler aras\u0131 ge\u00e7i\u015fte \u00e7ok kolay tek tu\u015fla istedi\u011fimiz an bir karakterden di\u011ferine ge\u00e7ebiliyoruz. \n\nOyunda her karakterin kendini \u00f6zg\u00fc ultimate skili var. Ba\u015flarda bunlar\u0131n d\u00fc\u015f\u00fck seviye olanlar\u0131 a\u00e7\u0131kken, ilerde baz\u0131lar\u0131 hikaye ile baz\u0131lar\u0131 ise yan g\u00f6revlerle a\u00e7\u0131l\u0131yor. 20 tane yan g\u00f6rev var oyunda bunlardan 12 tanesi oyunda belli bir a\u015famaya gelince (daha do\u011frusu bir mekana gidince) iptal oluyor. O a\u015famaya kadar da size bol bol vakit veriyor oyun g\u00f6revi yapman\u0131z i\u00e7in. Hepsini yapman\u0131za gerek yok ama spo vermeden ucundan s\u00f6yleyim; iksir g\u00f6revini, ufak bi yarat\u0131k bulma g\u00f6revi var onu ve 3 tane yarat\u0131k kesme g\u00f6revi var. Bunlar\u0131 yaparsan\u0131z \u00e7ok faydas\u0131n\u0131 g\u00f6r\u00fcrs\u00fcn\u00fcz. \u00c7okta vakit yemiyorlar zaten. \n\nOyunda sentez mekani\u011fi var. Yani \u00e7e\u015fitli materialler toplay\u0131p bunlar\u0131 birle\u015ftirerek silahlar, z\u0131rhlar, aksesuarlar yapabiliyoruz. Bu materiallerin baz\u0131lar\u0131 \u00e7evreden bulunurken, baz\u0131lar\u0131 yarat\u0131klardan d\u00fc\u015f\u00fcyor. Hangi yarat\u0131k hangi materiali d\u00fc\u015f\u00fcr\u00fcyor monster listden bakabilirsiniz. Ben harvest edilebilenleri etraftan toplamay\u0131 tercih ettim. Daha \u00e7abuk toplan\u0131yor o \u015fekilde. Ayr\u0131ca bir yerdeki materiali toplad\u0131ktan k\u0131a bir s\u00fcre sonra o material tekrardan orda ortaya \u00e7\u0131k\u0131yor. Ba\u015fka t\u00fcrl\u00fc de olmazd\u0131 zaten. Ultimate silah ve z\u0131rhlar\u0131 yapmak i\u00e7in (t\u00fcm karakterlere) s\u0131rf 450 den fazla soul stone gerekiyor. 100 tane ba\u015fka itemden 250 tane bir ba\u015fkas\u0131ndan. G\u00f6z\u00fcn\u00fcz korkmas\u0131n \u00e7ok h\u0131zl\u0131 bir \u015fekilde topluyorsunuz bunlar\u0131. 3-3 bu\u00e7uk saat civar\u0131 bir s\u00fcrede t\u00fcm karakterlerin ultimate setini yapabilirsiniz. \n\nOyunda skiller silahlara \u00f6zel ama burda \u015f\u00f6yle bir g\u00fczellik var. Skili \u00f6\u011frendi\u011finiz an o silah\u0131 gidip satabilirsiniz. Ve o \u00f6\u011frendi\u011finiz skili ba\u015fka silahlarda da kullanabiliyorsunuz. Bir g\u00fczellikte \u015fu skilki \u00f6\u011frenmek i\u00e7in d\u00f6v\u00fc\u015fe girmeniz gerekmiyor. Tak\u0131n skill boost veren aksesuar\u0131 sonra \u00f6\u011frenmek istedi\u011finiz skili bo\u015fa yapsan\u0131zda yapt\u0131n say\u0131yor oyun. Sonraki seviyeye ka\u00e7 exp kald\u0131\u011f\u0131n\u0131 men\u00fc equipten skilin \u00fczerine gelerek \u00f6\u011frenebilirsiniz. Skilleri kullanabilmek i\u00e7in mana gerekiyor. Oyunda maximum mana 100. Mana ise \u00e7e\u015fitli \u015fekillerde dolduruluyor. Bunlar; iksir i\u00e7me ki nightmare de o iksirden sadece 1 tane ta\u015f\u0131yabiliyorsunuz. D\u00f6v\u00fc\u015fler esnas\u0131nda vuru\u015funuza-iteminize ba\u011fl\u0131 olarak; bunu a\u00e7acam ya da buldu\u011funuz bir item sayesinde etrafta dola\u015f\u0131rken kendili\u011finden doluyor. D\u00f6v\u00fc\u015fte vuru\u015fa ba\u011fl\u0131 olarak mana dolmas\u0131 \u015fu; sald\u0131r\u0131 tu\u015funa bir bas\u0131l\u0131 tutup sonra b\u0131rak\u0131rsan\u0131z 15-20 civar\u0131 manay\u0131 birden dolduruyor. \u00d6teki t\u00fcrl\u00fc 3-5 3-5 g\u0131d\u0131m g\u0131d\u0131m doluyor yani. \u0130teminize ba\u011fl\u0131 derken de; d\u00f6v\u00fc\u015flerde mana dolumunu h\u0131zland\u0131ran bir aksesuar var. 100 bin gold civar\u0131 bir paraya sat\u0131n alabilirsiniz bu. \n\nYS Seven\u0131n bir g\u00fczelli\u011fi de \u015fu; bir \u00e7ok oyunda itemi al\u0131rs\u0131n\u0131z 100 liraya satars\u0131n\u0131z 30 liraya. 70 lira girer. Hadi bu \u00f6nemsiz bir miktar. 5 bin bay\u0131l\u0131rs\u0131n\u0131z iteme lan bu i\u015fime yaram\u0131yormu\u015f dersiniz geri satars\u0131n\u0131z 200 lira vermez \u015ferefsiz sat\u0131c\u0131. Bu oyunda o yok. 25bin mi verdiniz iteme 25 bine satars\u0131n\u0131z. Ayr\u0131ca bir itemin fiyat\u0131 A d\u00fckkan\u0131nda neyse B d\u00fckkan\u0131nda da odur. D\u00fckkanlardan bahsetmi\u015fken 3-4 milyon rahat harcam\u0131\u015f\u0131md\u0131r, senteziydi, silah-z\u0131rh almas\u0131yd\u0131, potuydu falan derken. Zaten bir tane item var fiyat\u0131 1 milyon. Oynarsan\u0131z g\u00f6r\u00fcrs\u00fcn\u00fcz.\n\nHikayeye gelince Ark of Napisthimin bitti\u011fi yerden ba\u015fl\u0131yor. Ve grubuzdaki bir karakter Ark of Napisthimde hikayede \u00e7ok \u00f6nemli bir yere sahip. Do\u011frudan bu oyundan ba\u015flamak yerine YS 1-2 chroniclesden ba\u015flay\u0131p s\u0131rayla gitmek daha do\u011fru olur. Do\u011frudan seven\u0131 oynars\u0131n\u0131z di\u011ferlerini oynamadan ama hikayeye \u00f6nem veriyorsan\u0131z YS 1-2 chroniclesden ba\u015flay\u0131p; origin-celceta-felghana ... diye hikaye s\u0131ras\u0131yla giderseniz daha g\u00fczel olur. Seven hikayenin sonu. Direkt sevendan ba\u015flamak - durumu tam  olarak a\u00e7\u0131klamasa da \u015f\u00f6yle \u00f6rnek vereyim - game of thrones a 6. sezondan ba\u015flamak gibi bir \u015fey olur. \n\nOyun orjinalinde psp oyunu ve 8-10 y\u0131ll\u0131k bir oyun. PC ye yeni \u00e7\u0131kt\u0131 (2017 de) o y\u00fczden pek bir grafik beklemeyin. Grafik feti\u015fistlerine g\u00f6re de\u011fil bu oyun. \n\n\u015eu ana kadar ki k\u0131s\u0131m i\u00e7in puan verecek olursam 86/100 rahatl\u0131kla verebilece\u011fim bir puan. Kaba tabirle oyunun rahat bir 80 ederi var ki bu da YS Seven\u0131n gayet iyi bir oyun oldu\u011funu g\u00f6sterir.

Let's get it out of the way first:  The main storyline is a lazy cliche.  First, go collect five things related to the five elements Fire, Water, Air, Earth, and Moon.  Got them?  Ok.  Now collect five different things related to those elements, and go confront the final boss to prevent the destruction of the land.  That's the main storyline in a nutshell, and it really pains me how little effort was put into it.  There is also very little exploration to be done in the game world, and what little there is amounts to making sure you find all the (fairly obvious) treasure nooks in each area.\n\nThat's not to say that the whole thing is boring to sit through.  The interactions between characters are more interesting, for example.  I grew fairly fond of the majority of the main cast and was generally interested in their thoughts and feelings about the things happening around them.  Of course what every Ys game really emphasizes, and where this one shines, is combat!\n\nCombat in Ys Seven varies by opponent, and for the most part each area has enemies that will ensure you are exercising your dodging skills.  Most normal mobs are not terribly difficult once you learn their attack patterns, but most will require you to fight intelligently rather than button mash.  Bosses range from fairly easy to very challenging.  When I say this, I mean that their many unique attack patterns can make avoiding damage quite difficult.  Not a problem on the \"Normal\" difficulty setting, where healing items will let you power through mistakes, but even hardcore gamers will find a challenge on higher settings.

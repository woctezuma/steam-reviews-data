Don't worry though - no matter what you do to them, your curly heroes will end up just fine.\n\nIn total there are 45 levels plus bonus ones (which you have to unlock first); they are not particularly hard, but if you're stuck, you can use in-game hints. Puzzles have just enough variety to not become repetitive, some of them are pretty creative and, in addition to that, everything is very nicely drawn - the game looks like a picture book for children, and this style suits it well. Besides the main campaign there is a lot to unlock - the game has plenty of hidden items, achievements and a score system for those who like perfecting everything.

I did, and I even rewatched the original short films recently. They are just as great now as back then. Thus, you can imagine how excited I was to discover that Aardman Animations had not only made a video game, but was selling it on Steam! That, along with the adorable ingame pictures, is what led to me wishlisting Home Sheep Home 2.\n\nThanks to a very generous friend, I received this as a gift and played it immediately to show my gratitude. I am glad I did! It's a fantastic game for many reasons. Check below for a flock-ton of reasons to give it a try!\n\n[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]\n[list][*]The graphics are cute as can be. The three sheep made me want to reach through the screen and hug them. Overall, the aestetic looks more like it is drawn than computer-designed, and it helps give Home Sheep Home 2 its unique personality.\n[*]There is a simple story. The game does not need more than that. What is worth noting is the lack of dialogue. Aardman Animations has always been good at telling tales through visuals, though dialogue is used in their other works. In this case, you can understand what is going on perfectly fine in terms of story-telling despite having non-speaking sheep.\n[*]The characters are great. You have three sheep: Shirley, Shaun, and Timmy. They each have their own strengths and weaknesses, which means you have to use all three to finish the levels. For instance, Shirley is able to push large objects as the biggest sheep, while Timmy can fit through small holes due to his tiny size. Shaun is the best jumper and acts as the middle ground between the other two. This means that not only do you have three characters to play as, but that they are all necessary and different from one another.\n[*]In terms of controls, Home Sheep Home 2 does very well. It is easy to switch between the three sheep using the numeric keys, and you have an option to use your mouse instead. Moving with the arrow keys is no trouble, and using space to jump makes it simple to get around. There are not many controls needed, and the ones present are good.\n[*]Three tutorial levels are present. They are good for getting to know the game. You can also skip past them if you don't want to bother with them. As for myself, I liked going through them.\n[*]With 45 levels, all having different designs and concepts, this will keep you busy for a while. There are also 15 bonus levels that you unlock with collectibles, meaning that with the tutorial levels included, there is a total of 63 levels. The levels are grouped into three areas: the mines, London, and space. They serve as themes, but that does not mean they are identical. The change in level set-ups and tactics keeps the game fresh and fun.\n[*]There is platforming, but it is primarily a puzzle game. Working out how to go through each level with the three sheep tickles the brain in just the right ways. Most solutions are not difficult to figure out, but they do require thinking. There are some levels that are trickier, and they are rewarding to figure out.\n[*]Lots of collectibles are scattered throughout the levels. You can collect socks for fun, cupcakes to get \"cheats\" ingame, and video game controllers to open bonus levels. Some are out in the open, and others are well hidden. It's definitely worth finding them all!\n[*]For those interested in speedrunning, each level has times to beat for up to three stars. There are also developer times that are insane to overcome. If you like a challenge, give those a try!\n[*]Once you beat the game, you can see developer commentaries in each level. There are interesting bits of trivia, and there are funny ones. They're worth checking out.\n[*]There are 52 achievements. Some are simple to get, while others will test your skills. I enjoyed them a lot. None were overly frustrating, but I also felt like I earned several rather than having them handed to me on a silver platter. Those kinds of achievements that take effort, but are not almost impossible, are the ones I prefer.\n[*]This makes for a wonderful family game. Both children and adults should get several hours of enjoyment out of it. It took me over eight hours to complete everything besides all the developer time challenges. I'm sure people playing it together will get even more hours out of it. I'll probably give it a replay at some point just for fun!\n[*]Wallace and Gromit fans will find homages to the films inside Home Sheep Home 2, along with several Easter eggs to different movies and series. Even more than that, Shaun fans will be thrilled to find that he is one of the three playable sheep! He looks a bit healthier than in [i]A Close Shave[/i], but his trademark grin certainly brought back fond memories for me.\n[*]Almost every level has a sheep-related pun. The credits even lists two people as being responsible for them. I won't spoil them, but as much as I groaned at them, they were pretty great, and several were quite clever.[/list]\n\n[b][u]Neutral:[/u][/b]\n[list][*]None of the levels have music. There is a fanfare at entering levels, but that's the closest you'll get. I would have liked some good tunes. At the same time, looping music in puzzle games can get infuriating quickly. Having silence is probably a safer option, so I can't criticize it too much.\n[*]I was sad to discover that the first Home Sheep Home is not on Steam. It is free in other locations, though, so it is at least easily accessible. I plan to give it a try sometime.\n[*]There are no trading cards. I was a bit disappointed since I think they would have very cute art, but I certainly don't count it as a strike against the game.[/list]\n\n[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]\n[list][*]There are two levels where dynamite has to be used to launch the sheep to the end of the level. One of these is fairly painless. The other has some physics that I found very difficult to deal with. That one level was the worst part of the game for me. Thankfully it was only one level, so I can easily overlook that.\n[*]A lot of the bonus levels are a previous level with a small change. That small change requires different tactics to complete the level. While I found those interesting, I would have preferred more that were completely new levels. There are some, but I did want more.\n[*]You can get yourself trapped and be stuck for good. Fortunately, the level will restart automatically if that happens, and it can be manually restarted without a hitch. This did happen to me once, though. Some rock physics went wonky and stuck poor Shaun into the boulder and ground. I wouldn't call it an outright glitch, but it was a slip-up that probably shouldn't have happened.[/list]\n\n[b]Overall experience:[/b]\n\nI had a blast with Home Sheep Home 2! It's a charming game that is fun for players of all ages. $9.99 is a fair full price. Anything lower is a baaa-rgain! Whether you have seen the movies from Aardman Animations or not, it is worth playing this. Maybe it will even convince you to check out their other works!\n\n[b]Rating:[/b]\n\n9.5/10. Honestly, I can't see any reason to give it lower than that. There are so many great things about Home Sheep Home 2 with so few flaws, and that means it really earns its high score. I highly recommend this bleatiful game!\n\n[quote]Looking for more great indie games?

It is a puzzle game, which I usually don't like, but after having played a crappy one (logigun) that did everything the wrong way, this game got it right. The art and music were nice. There was not really a story but that's not a big deal. The humor was good. It was nice how each sheep has its own abilities, you'll start to get to know them for that and develp a favorite. It is also cool how each one makes its own sound. Unlike that crap logigun game, the puzzles are well done. Instead of a giant room with 12 switches, 15 moveable boxes, 10 lazers, and only 1 single solution the creators made so you have to figure out the exact order they want you to do it so you can beat the level, which takes 30 minutes of looking and isn't intuitive, this game is the opposite. The puzzles are clever, require reasoning and logic, and can actually be solved multiple ways (some of them). Once again, as opposed to the logigun game, you are not in just a single boring looking nondescript room, each level has different setting and objectives and you operate different machinery, so it actually feels like the puzzles has a purpose instead of just \"open final door\". There are 3 episodes which are each differently themed. The variety kept everything interesting, and it wasn't just stupidly over hard for the sake of being so (logigun......sorry I just played the game right before this so I am drawing all my comparisons). The game was kind of short though and I guess you can play a similar version online for free on a flash website. 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1423937609, "timestamp_updated": 1436158791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562782", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14419253": {"recommendationid": "14419253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134655600", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474641318}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0414\u043b\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430.\n\u0425\u043e\u0442\u044c \u044f \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u044e \u0432 \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438, \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043d\u0430\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430.\n\u041e\u0437\u0432\u0443\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f.\n\u0425\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u0439\u043c\u043a\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0440? \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u0430\u0441.", "timestamp_created": 1423585271, "timestamp_updated": 1423585271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14263735": {"recommendationid": "14263735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117899222", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429982205}, "language": "german", "review": "Das Game ist liebevoll gestaltet und es macht sehr viel Spa\u00df, allerdings ist es zu schwierig f\u00fcr die eigentliche Zielgruppe.\nKleine Kinder haben nicht die Geduld lange genug an einem schweren Level zu bleiben und verlieren so die Lust am Spiel.\nFazit: Sch\u00f6nes Spiel, leider fehlt der Antrieb die Level fertig zu spielen", "timestamp_created": 1422726810, "timestamp_updated": 1422726810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512827", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13040369": {"recommendationid": "13040369", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991010756", "num_games_owned": 457, "num_reviews": 360, "playtime_forever": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416665650}, "language": "french", "review": "Je trouve le concept trop sheep pour recommander ce jeu.", "timestamp_created": 1416665376, "timestamp_updated": 1416665376, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441176", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12980422": {"recommendationid": "12980422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074169975", "num_games_owned": 551, "num_reviews": 283, "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416223826}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is fun, with not too difficult puzzles and an helping system that prevents from beeing blocked on a level.

etc.\n-Shirley, the big one, can move heavy objects.\n-Shaun can jump highest of all three, so he can reach platforms, which are out of reach for the others.\nMostly you have to combine the skills of all three to get them all to the exit. \nThere are only a few levels, where the skills doesn't matter at all.\nIn general the levels aren't that hard, but the \"Lost in Space\"-chapter has some levels, which can be tricky to figure out or have some tricky platforming part.\nThe only negative point I can think of is that the last levels of the \"Lost in Space\"-chapter has some control problems(they invert sometimes, but I haven't figured out why), but they aren't that bad and doesn't influence the flow that much.\nSo all in all I would recommend this game to all people, who like a

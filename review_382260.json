Totally worth the money. I've had hours of fun with friends playing through the myriad of minigames, and my friends that don't even like playing video games still enjoy this game.\n\nI find it interesting that the load screen always stops on the \"Bull Shit\" game splash screen during multiplayer - except when it is going to be that minigame. Minor inconvenience. (Has no effect on gameplay.)\n\n\n\nNOTICE: THE REVIEW FROM THIS POINT IS FOR ONLY THE SINGLE PLAYER MODE OF THE FULL GAME.\n\nI bought this game for $8.00 US.\n\nThe single player mode is creative, but the \"humor\" is both run into the ground and really not funny to begin with. I'm not offended by swearing (and if you are, definitely walk away from this title,) but this game offends me not by the words used, but the use of the words. \n\nThe jump mechanic is inconsistent and irritating. (So far only attempted on keyboard, not the recommended XBox controller.) Whichever keyboard control scheme I choose to use, I frequently find that my second jump is \"used up\" by what was input as a single jump. (As confirmed by 3rd party keystroke reporting software.)\n\nInconsistency in level design manifests in ballistics and deadly traps that are harmless to allies of your enemies... MOST of the time. A bomb dropped from an enemy onto your aircraft will kill you, a similar bomb dropped on an enemy aircraft is harmless. However, a bullet fired by an enemy gun will kill another enemy.\nNot only does it suspend immersion, it removes what would be another skill angle for people to play towards. Sure, it can be considered impressive that you memorized the entire level and can high-speed run through it without having to restart, but wouldn't it be even MORE impressive to not only do so, but do it while making the enemies kill each other off?", "timestamp_created": 1500499781, "timestamp_updated": 1507477875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489477", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33416596": {"recommendationid": "33416596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068655059", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513377908}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome party game or just for losing friends. \n\nHas a decent amount of minigames, but it would be awesome if they added more, even if it is by DLC or something.", "timestamp_created": 1499639508, "timestamp_updated": 1499639508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504644", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33412680": {"recommendationid": "33412680", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970865092", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499632221}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game, played it since i got it evry evning with my gf :)\n\nworth evry krona :D\n\nPlaying it using steam link  + steam controller + xbox 360 controller, works like a charm", "timestamp_created": 1499628309, "timestamp_updated": 1499628309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33114210": {"recommendationid": "33114210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051721066", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512271415}, "language": "spanish", "review": "excelente game recomendado full diversion xD", "timestamp_created": 1498969405, "timestamp_updated": 1498969405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32995235": {"recommendationid": "32995235", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967966364", "num_games_owned": 1048, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514065897}, "language": "german", "review": "Eines der besten Couch Coop Spiele.

This is the game's greatest strength at this point in Early Access. While the game doesn't have a lot of mini games at this time, I actually had quite a bit of fun with some of them. The other mini games were solid as well. If the developers continue to add mini games, I think 8Bit Fiesta could be a good game.\n\nAt this point 8Bit Fiesta is more of a multiplayer game than a single player game. 8Bit Fiesta does have a single player mode which is pretty typical platformer. I have played some of the single player and there is nothing wrong with it but there is also nothing special about it. \n\nIf you are looking exclusively for a single player game, at this time I don't think 8Bit Fiesta is worth it. If you are looking for an interesting local multiplayer party game though, I think 8Bit Fiesta could surprise you. \n\nNote: I received a free review copy from the developer.\n\n[url=http://www.geekyhobbies.com/this-weeks-steam-releases-and-reviews-october-2nd-2015/#8BitFiesta] Read My Full Review [/url]\n", "timestamp_created": 1443970184, "timestamp_updated": 1443970184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18322339": {"recommendationid": "18322339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104867238", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465647837}, "language": "english", "review": "Great rage game, I keep dying even on the first level.

It\u2019s 5 euros, takes 5 minutes to learn and 5 hours to master and then you have a multiplayer game that\u2019s filled with competition and laughs. The mix of classic mini-games makes it very dynamic, one game is similar to Doodle Jump, another is like Duck Hunt and then you finish of with something similar to Bomber Man or Tower Fall. Other games could have been classics in my opinion, but are introduced by the developer in 8bitfiesta. \nIt\u2019s easy to control your character and put some strategic thoughts in the execution of the mini games, especially when you get to know your opponents. \nThe game itself is really fun and the party mode definitely adds an extra spice. The premise is easy, win 5 mini games first and you are the champion. For every mini-game you don\u2019t win you have to drink, more or less depending on how bad your were. Once again the dynamic of the different mini-games makes it really even. In comparison with other games (that I usually play in combination with friends and beers) like FIFA, NHL or racing games, once you\u2019ve ended up in a bad streak with a lot of drinking you are a \u2018lost case\u2019 so to speak \u2013 that\u2019s not the case here. \n\n\nNo friends mode (single player)\nThe big USP in 8bitfiesta is the multiplayer mode, preferably the fiesta mode like I\u2019ve said. But it has a single player mode, very funny labeled the \u2018No friends\u2019 mode. This also builds on several \u201cmini-games\u201d, you basically start at point A and are supposed to reach point B, with obstacles and difficult jumps on the way. \nSince the multiplayer mode is so good, the No friends mode is just what it says. Sorry bro, you have no friends and have to play alone. This is fun but not nearly as fun as it would have been if you had friends and were able to play the multiplayer or fiesta mode. \nBut try it out for yourself, I\u2019m just mesmerized by the multiplayer mode. \n\n\nSome conclusions\n-\tPlay with friends, preferably in combination with beers \n-\tDynamic mixture of mini games, they are all different! Some inspired by classic games and the others creatively designed. \n-\tGore, characters and the overall design makes it really enjoyable for the eyes and you play with a smile on your face\n-\tIf have to play the No Friends mode, you need to get out more often. Get some friends. \n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1443868086, "timestamp_updated": 1443868086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528857", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18301657": {"recommendationid": "18301657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068269930", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488356738}, "language": "english", "review": "wonderful game :) a real fun game to play with friends :D i absolutley recommend this to anyone who wants to play a good local multiplayer game :D (heres some fun gameplay) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMjOqNrsWtg", "timestamp_created": 1443848563, "timestamp_updated": 1443848600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483894", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18293084": {"recommendationid": "18293084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000253161", "num_games_owned": 3571, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455582758}, "language": "english", "review": "Sorry kids, no Christmas this year.

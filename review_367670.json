Because if you press Back (+ any other button) it will do the thing that you've set up for (like open the map, or any action that doesn't need immediate reflexes, or changing the music track of your player, cut your mic from your stream or even launch any .exe you chose.\n\nYou can also play some FPS with the mouse emulation, only your movement will not be analog, of course, it's still WASD or ZQSD (for France). I finished Antichamber with that, for example, but don't wish to reach the leaderboards of something crazy quick like Quake III or SEUM...\nStill you can ^may any oldies or point 'n clicks.\nThere's also a shortcut to let you see what are the current bindings (that you can change for a specific game and it will go back to the default config automatically when you'll switch window).\n\nIf you need to write stuff you have three options, the built-in spiral keyboard, not as bad as it seems, really, the Steam virtual keyboard (Back + Guide) and the Xbox Chatpad.\n\nAnyway, buy it, it's the best, simplest and more affordable solution you got here, although there might be a thing or two that are missing compared to XPadder, like some different analog sticks modes, but I used Xpadder for like five years, and Controller Companion for 3 weeks, and I'm really loving it.\n\nIt's undeniably the most intuitive and practical solutions for what it makes, and that's a lot of things.\n\nAlso the price is just as amazing as its content.", "timestamp_created": 1516209155, "timestamp_updated": 1516209768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39412191": {"recommendationid": "39412191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256471816", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 612, "last_played": 1515595504}, "language": "english", "review": "The interface is a bit hard to get used to at first but you get used to it, works as promised.", "timestamp_created": 1516192805, "timestamp_updated": 1516192805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39402882": {"recommendationid": "39402882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052006705", "num_games_owned": 1044, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 144, "last_played": 1516476343}, "language": "english", "review": "What caught my attention with this app was the feature of disabling itself at the correct time but it really isn't that useful.

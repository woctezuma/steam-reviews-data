It starts off slow, what with being cutesy, and the characters seeming two-dimensional. However, this stops once you start having some of their events. The story takes an unexpectedly dark twist in the second Act, which just makes the VN even better; it tests the relationships you've already made with the girls, as well as your character's own will, and your own, to see this depressing tale to the end. It even manages to discuss issues like race and class, in a small cutesy visual novel about anime girls. It surprised me many times, in a really good way. My only complaint is that the Lavania route made me uncomfortable because I feel it was pretty abusive, and I'm pretty sure that wasn't intended by the writers, unlike the abuse of others in the story. But all the other routes are damn good imo, so hitting the mark five times out of six deserves a good review. 8/10 am trying to force people I know to play this.", "timestamp_created": 1515355927, "timestamp_updated": 1515355927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38997229": {"recommendationid": "38997229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122547420", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 190, "last_played": 1515514220}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a lovely game.

I especially loved how flawed the MC is, pride is a trait I haven't seen in many (female) MCs and it's refreshing. There are few CGs, but those that exist are beautiful, just like the art and music in general. I will say that at times there's just not a lot happening and it might be too slow paced for some people, but I personally liked the focus on character developement.

It uses simple \"dating sim\" mechanics (resource management), but describing it us such or calling it a \"yuri\" game would be rather misleading. While there is some romance involved, it\u2019s very mild and tactful and some routes are rather about friendship than love. And above all, it focuses on the main character and her life and hardships.[/b]\n\nWhat make this VN especially unique is the setting \u2013 it\u2019s a loose adaptation of an English novel [i]A Little Princess[/i] and the story is deeply connected to the context of Victorian-era London. The writing and art-style do a very good job of creating appropriate climate and representing the strict social divisions of XIX century\u2019s England, which are crucial to the story. Unlike many western VNs, that copy the formula of Japanese ones to the point of setting the story in Japan, this one is has a strong identity that makes it stand out from the crowd.\n\nThe storytelling itself is a bit slow and often painfully sad and cruel, but the climate and characters make it captivating most of the time. Especially the protagonist, Sara, is a wonderful character that it\u2019s hard not to fall in love with. Some might find her a bit too flawless, but she\u2019s definitely not a Mary Sue, having a lot of interesting traits and reacting in believable ways to the misfortunes that fall upon her. The rest of the cast is also rather interesting and they all show significant amount of depth in their respective routes. Every one of them have a different relationship with the main character and most of the time it\u2019s very interesting to see how their relations develop and change through the plot twists that the main storyline offers. I would describe only three of the character routes as explicitly \u201cromantic\u201d, but all of them had impact and a lot of charm (even with all the sad/unsettling elements in most of them).\n\nThe art and music are very good, with sprites, backgrounds and CGs being both nice to look at and characteristic. CGs are not that numerous for a game that can take around 15 hours for full playthrough, but their quality make the experience very pleasing to the eye.\n\n[b]Maybe the weakest part of the game is the resource management mechanic, which is very much dependent on RNG and doesn\u2019t by itself add any real challenge to the game[/b], unless you strategize to unlock multiple routes in the first chapter. Also the choice of \u201cevents\u201d, that means choosing with what characters you\u2019ll interact, is the only thing influencing the story \u2013 there are no dialogue choices per se. The UI can be a bit confusing at first, but the whole gameplay, while extremely limited, is at least very thematic and adds to the mood of the game.\n\n[b]In summary, while its not without some faults and limitation, I think A Little Lily Princess is a great and exceptional game - a true must-buy for any VN fan.[/b] The yuri romantic themes are a bonus, but the game doesn\u2019t rely on them that much and can prove a great experience even if you\u2019re not a fan of the genre. Even at full price it\u2019s a good value proposition and when on sale it\u2019s hard for me to not recommend it not just to fans of visual novels, but anyone who\u2019s interesting in reading a touching, memorable story.", "timestamp_created": 1506861146, "timestamp_updated": 1507032042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645392", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35378765": {"recommendationid": "35378765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304977002", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506858737}, "language": "english", "review": "Becky best girl.", "timestamp_created": 1506858853, "timestamp_updated": 1506858853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506992", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34587691": {"recommendationid": "34587691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092621084", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504038894}, "language": "english", "review": "It's not a perfect VN, but it's very good and is my second favorite that I've played.

But overall, it does a great job of drawing you in and making you care, able to move you on a number of emotional levels, from childlike joy and wonderful friendship to crushing heartbreak and even rage. There is a lot of common text that at some point you may feel the need to simply skip through, but even after doing that I found I had spent quite a lot of time clearing the whole thing. The art is fantastic all around, even though there is not a large amount of CGs. One of the best things the game does is the music. Often times it's good, and sometimes it's great, but there is one particular track (I'm sure you'd know it if you heard it) that will have me tracking down  its sheet music so that I can try to replicate it. It's so wonderful, and captured for me the essence of the protagonist Sara at her best: joyful and free and always believing in Magic.

Those familiar with the novel will know what this game is about. The main character is Sara Crewe, a young girl (we don't really know what her age is so we can only guess) who arrives in England from India to attend an all girls boarding school. There, she meets a cast of characters and based on who you choose to have Sara interact with, she can form friendships or romance among six of them. \n\nAlthough this is the second game published by Hanako Games based on a novel, I found this one to be more enjoyable than Sword Daughter. For one, as this is a life simulation game, there is an element where you choose to have Sara do certain activities (i.e., tutor, write in her diary, have a tea party) which will earn certain icons. These icons are needed to progress with various characters' paths. Despite this element, you don't need a walkthrough to successfully complete a path, as the game shows you what icons are needed to obtain certain scenes and such. Also, I found the writing to be more to my liking. Although I did find Sara to be naive at times (even after a certain event takes place), I liked taking on her character and seeing how she interacted with the others, even when she wasn't on certain characters' paths. Of course, the art (especially the CGs) and music were great and I really liked the ending song. (I suppose it's the genre that I like. XD) I enjoyed playing all of the paths as well although I did like some more than others. However, I'd say that I liked half of the paths I played and I was satisfied with the others. (For anyone who's curious, my favorite paths would be Becky's, Ermengarde's, and Jessie's.)\n\nI would definitely recommend this game, especially for those who are fans of VNs, life simulations, etc. The story is very light-hearted although there is a bit of a serious element although it's more on the dramatic side than anything else.

I played her route second to last. So, being subjected to her cruelty in all the other routes made it kind of hard for me to set that aside. I mean, she's also kind of cruel in her own route, in a \"why don't you love me\" sorta way.

And it was one I honestly wasn't expecting.\nWhen I bought this VN, it was simply because it was a Yuri-VN. God knows there aren't a whole lot of those around, so I immediately wanted to get this one. As I opened it up, I quickly knew I was gonna love it, as its artwork and writing were just stunning right off the bat. In fact, there were multiple moments throughout the story where I read a line and just paused for a second to take in what I had just read... I'm not gonna lie, the writing in this Visual Novel is absolutely stellar in my opinion.\nBut good writing's of little importance if the story isn't interesting... so what about the story here?\n\nAt the start of the story, we are introduced to Sara Crewe, daughter of a British soldier in India during the era of Victorian England. She is sent to an English school as part of her education while her father has to stay in India. Sara, as one quickly learns, is a well-behaved, clever and nice girl who loves three things more than anything else: her father, her doll and stories. Both the ones she reads in books and the ones she makes up in her mind. \nAs the story progresses, one is introduced to a number of characters, amongst which are her head-teacher, her maid, a servant of the school and four other students. Out of those seven, six are people whose route the player can go down through picking them for the weekend-events.\n\nSpeaking of 'week', this VN also features a week-management minigame, in which you choose which tasks - such as writing in her diary or reading books - Sara does over the course of the week, all of which increase certain stats of hers, like 'vigor' or 'sympathy'. Said stats are required to unlock the weekend-events for the characters of your choice.\nIf one were to name the parts that make up this VN, they'd be 'week start VN Part' -> week-management -> 'weekend VN Part' -> 'Weekend event' -> repeat.\n\nAt this point I would like to hang out a MASSIVE spoiler warning. I'm serious. Unless you REALLY want to get the entirety of the plot spoiled for you, do NOT read the things behind the spoiler-tag.\n[spoiler]\nAs one progresses through the story, deepening their relationships with everybody, there is one person that sticks out like a sore thumb: The head-teacher of the private school Sara goes to. At first she is somewhat rude towards our heroine, trying to chastise her for not having learned French, then, after one of the letters Sara's father sent to her mentions that he's currently in the process of getting a diamond mine, the head-teacher suddenly starts treating her as her favorite student, telling others to behave like she does, having her stand first in line during outings, all that stuff... and while that would already be enough to make her unlikable as hell, this isn't even the big switch.\n\nThe BIG plottwist hits roughly half-way through the game. After half a year in her new school, Sara is about to have her first birthday in England. In previous letters, Sara's father had stated that he was having a fever and also hinted that he might be coming to London for his daughter's birthday. On top of that, the head-teacher had prepared a large birthday-party for her 'favorite' student, to make her feel welcome. Then, on her birthday, Sara got dressed up in her finest clothes, got a beautiful doll as a gift and had a beautiful party with everybody from her school... and that's where the pleasant things abruptly end. That's because on the same day, Sara received the information that her father had died. It was a combination of the fever and stress from the diamond-mine-business that had led to his death. And while that information alone would already be way more than enough to destroy any day for Sara, this was nothing compared to what followed, as her head-teacher also learned of the father's death and finally revealed her true face. When it became obvious that Sara had nobody to take care of her, the head-teacher was ready to just throw her out on the street, but after being convinced that doing so would harm the school's image, she instead did the 'honorable' deed of letting her stay... as a servant, in a filthy room in the attic, giving her inhumanly amounts of work and nowhere near enough food. This sudden 180 already managed to get me from 'I like this VN. This is really well written ^-^' to 'woah, woah, woah. Wait a second, please. What in the world just happened??'... and it didn't end there.\n\nRemember the little 'week-management' thing I talked about earlier?? Ha, ha... well, it's still there. But instead of 'have a tea party' or 'tutor juniors', your choices are now along the lines of 'tend the fires' and 'clean and polish'. Instead of increasing 'vigor' or 'knowledge', these tasks now increase stats like 'pain', ' fatigue' or 'hunger'. You have no idea how hard this sudden change hit. Before, this little game was something that I did somewhat willy-nilly, picking based on what felt like decent choices... but now, it had literally become a game of life and death.\n\nThe only salvation presented was the weekend event, which also still happened and which lowered some stats (which made me say 'THANK LORD' more times than you might think). For this part, you are only allowed to play events with the characters you were closest to. After a few weeks, this gets narrowed down even further to the one person whose route you will go down.\n\nFrom this point onwards, the 'week-management' game is pretty much a perfect summary of Sara's new life: you try your damn hardest every week just so you don't die, with only the weekends providing any sort of solace. But try as you may, the situation is gonna look grimmer and grimmer with every passing week.\n\nVery, very luckily for Sara (and me), some things were starting to get rolling outside of her home. In the house opposite to the school, an old man moved in. Said man was the friend of Sara's father and on the lookout for her. With him, he had an Indian friend that had saved his life while he was in India and his pet monkey...both of which befriended Sara from across the street (via the attic-windows & because the monkey tended to come over to her room) without either of the parties knowing who the other was. After the old man and the Indian learned how kind of a girl Sara was, they decide to help her out a little by making her room more enjoyable to be in (giving it some color, a new mattress, etc) and getting her something to eat. After they also send her a new dress, the head-teacher decides to let her take part in school-activities again (as she thought that it was some kind of relative that might be able to pay for her education). A short while afterward, Sara goes over to the two men's house (as the monkey had come over again and she did not want it to go crazy inside of the school), where all the puzzle-pieces fell into place: she learned who the old man was, the old man found out that the girl he was looking for had been much closer than he thought and Sara finally had an actual future to look forward to again.\n[/spoiler]\nNow the only thing left on the table was the conclusion of the character-route one had chosen. And I have to say... the romantic conclusion of this VN was probably the only part that WASN'T amazingly done. It had everything it needed, don't get me wrong, but it was just concluded over the course of maybe 20 screens (not scenes, screens), which made it feel slightly rushed. But nevertheless, this VN was one hell of an amazing ride. There were more than a couple moments that could get anyone to pause for a second and made you feel for the heroine like few other works do.\nIf you have 15\u20ac (or whatever's your equivalent) to spare, you SERIOUSLY owe it to yourself to buy this VN and read it.

Some more obvious than the other.. Even though you might have the impression of the protagonist(now, finally namedropping), Sara Crewe, to be saccharine, she is not without bad thoughts or, at times, ill intent.\n\nAbout the romance in this VN ... it's not the main focus of the plot. It's very subtle, and the girls don't really do more than hugging or kissing approx. one time each, if at all. Sometimes I wonder if their relationships were necessary at all and not just inserted there to be able to call it yuri. I don't think they add to the overal plot, because the ending is the same no matter what route you chose(is this a spoiler?). So, what point is it to have the romantic options in the first place if they don't affect anything?... Then again, this vn is based on a novel, which I personally didn't read, but I feel that the quintessence of it is still in here and I may or may not look for the original, because of the moral it teaches.\n\nThis visual novel has actual gameplay - an RNG based one. At the start at the week you can set up a schedule for Sara to go through in that week and watch her gain several, some, or even no \"Icons\" at all. Icons translate to how much grace, knowledge, patience, and other, she owns(kind of like different types of currency). With those she can unlock special story events with the other girls in her school that will drive the story of their relationship parallel to the mainplot.\nThe mechanics themselves are not hard and you can abuse the quick save/load option until you get the amount you need to unlock a character event.\n\nThe art itself is beautiful, of course, coming from someone who bought it because they saw inma's art on it. The backgrounds are lovely, but possibly forgettable. There are not many CGs, but the ones that are there are very beautiful and feel like a real treat. What took me a little by surprise was the good music - or at least, I do like most of the tracks, even though I can't recall it off the top of my head right now, I could see myself having it in the background while doing something else(the extras/gallery option offers to play certain tracks).\n\nTL;DR: Looks good, sounds good, nice for afternoon read with heartache at the end.

Actually the most of gameplay is about main character chit chatting and gossiping (and anything seems interesting in this conversations, but that doesn't mean that conversations are short, at the opposite you have to read lots of text). Whatever you do, the end is almost the same. They will be talking and talking...\n\n2) That bring me to choices. Is this really the choice? Even if it doesn't matter on what I click? Yes, you have to collect some traits to unlock scenes whit conversations, but most of them needs very small amounts of them so you even don't have to think about it. Whatever you do, the end is almost the same and that makes you feel it doesn't matter what you do at the game.\n\n3) Yes, story isn't the strongest part, but graphic is nice. So you can at least look at pretty pictures, no? Unfortunately, there are so little changes (for example every room of other pupils looks same - for all of them there is exactly same picture looking as hotel room without any personal thing even while game says something else) ...Why is main character wearing the same dresses as always when the story says she have the new ones? Even she don't have the ones on the picture?\n\nWell...it's not bad game, but it doesn't worth it's price at all.

The 1995 movie \"A Little Princess\"\nDue to it being only less than 2 hours and the anime being 46 episodes (approx. 14 hours long) it leaves out a lot of important converations and iterations between characters that I find really important to enjoy the story and feel attached to almost every character, also being it a disney movie it does not take the story as serious as the anime did.\n\n3.

Fanciful and burning with romantic optimism, it helped my younger self through many trials and tribulations. I always remembered little Sara telling herself to be a princess in spirit, even when her physical situation was anything but royal. Sure parts of the book are bordering on fairy tale cliches, but if anything that felt like the perception of the character, trying to believe that the ordinary could easily become extraordinary with enough will and imagination.\n\nFor the price and the quality of the content, this game is incredible, and a lovely read. In particular anyone who has read (and is a fan of) the original novel will likely enjoy it more for the little details and the new light shed on the story. There's not really many \"decisions\" except which character route to follow, which will flesh out the character and develop their relationship with Sara, but considering the source material I can't say I'm all that surprised. The icon system was just enough of a fun distraction but not in the least bit challenging. I like the way the system changes halfway through to reflect Sara's new daily life.\n\nThis game is the source material made even better, with extra character and embellishment. Giving human qualities and personalities to all of the girls mentioned made the message of the novel even brighter, and everything was told in a very similar style to the writing. I could easily believe some of the extra events that happen might have been construed by the original author. The art style is gorgeous, if pretty anime-esque, but it matched the feel-good tone of the game. The music too, was very fitting for the setting and various moods of the story, light and princess-like for the earlier game, with somber, heart-wrenching pieces for the latter half, and all of it very dreamy in the way a fairy tale might sound. \n\nRandom aside: I felt like laughing whenever I saw Sara's \"princess\" dress, mostly because it was the most frilly and cutesy thing I have ever seen and didn't quite mesh with her character, but whatever I loved it anyways.\n\nJessie 5ever", "timestamp_created": 1469227644, "timestamp_updated": 1469227644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24425103": {"recommendationid": "24425103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059007740", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468956035}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, it's about 6/10 overall.

It was very delightful and interesting. \n\nThere are 4 romance routes, and 2 friendship routes. It involves stat raising, but it is not tedious or annoying.\n\nIt takes place during the Victorian era in London, England. That is a vague time frame considering Queen Victoria ruled for 63 years. However, since the book this visual novel is based on was published in 1905, I would assume the story took place late in her reign before she died in 1901. \nThe young protagonist arrives at a boarding school for girls after living in India her whole life; do remember that The British Empire ruled over India for a long time. She is a tad out of place in her school for having grown up in India, and for also being half-French; The English and French are long-time rivals, after all. Although, elitist English aristocrats would have prejudice against anyone who wasn't completely English anyway.\nThe protagonist leads a comfortable, pampered life since her father is quite wealthy ... until things take a very tragic turn for her. However, through her formed bond with one of the 6 characters with a story route, she can survive.\n\nAmong the characters the protagonist can form romantic bonds with include: Lavinia (a snobby aristocrat student), Jessie (a student who desires to be beautiful), Ermegarde (a plump student with low self-esteem), and Becky (an ill-treated scullery servant). \nAmong the characters the protagonist can form friendship bonds with include: Mariette (the protagonist's personal French maid) and Lottie (an 8-year-old student). \n\nWhat I really enjoyed about this visual novel, besides the various cultural aspects one can learn about, was the important messages it projects. It tells the audience that women/girls can make a life for themselves, with or without men. It tells the audience that a person shouldn't stay with an abusive person whether they're capable of doing good things or not. It informs the audience about how women were treated like property in that time and the very few opportunities they had to escape that fate. Above all, it teaches the audience that classism and elitism are horrendous and cruel. \n\n[spoiler]I think Becky is canon, and I liked her route best.[/spoiler]\n\nI recommend this VN to anyone who enjoys stories with culture, history, strong friendships, and lovely romances.", "timestamp_created": 1468456673, "timestamp_updated": 1468456688, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679240", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24305858": {"recommendationid": "24305858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066145440", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509054145}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been looking for a fun little game to play, and this one fit the bill.

The challenge of colleting the right amount and type of icons before an event expired added a bit more challenge in balancing multiple routes through Act 1.  I completed all routes in about 7 hours of playtime and I feel that this amount of enjoyment justifies the game's price. At no point did going over the same content feel tedious due to the useful skip function.\n\nThe English boarding school setting provided an interesting plot which showcased each characters best and worst traits well. Each female companion's events felt well-rounded and sufficiently fleshed out to make each route enjoyable. There were both romance and friendship routes provided. The overarching storyline beyond Sara's relationships was touching and believable enough to truly make you feel strong positive and negative emotions. The storyline was well paced and not at all tedious or rushed.\n\nThe character design and CG artwork was above par and the unlockable scene art is wonderful. The game also features chibi artwork throughout the story which was quite adorable. The final bonus artwork added wonderfully to an existing plot line.

I've played visual novels before, and I had a cursory knowledge of the source material going in.\n\nIn short, this is a visual novel retelling of the story \"A Little Princess.\" It takes a few liberties with the source material such as Miss Minchin's sister being completely absent, and they created one character wholecloth.\n\nBeing a visual novel, there's really not much that you can expect from the game. The interface is clean, the mechanics are explained well enough, though the RNG element can make it frustrating if you're shooting for a specific ending. Jessie's route, for example, requires a high number of high count skills, while characters like Mariette and Becky tend to have lower costs. It also completely goes out the window in the second have of the game, where you can completely cheese the system.\n\nHow you feel about this game's plot will depend greatly on how you feel about the source material. If you don't like Victorian era novels with social commentary that inflict misfortunate on characters that don't deserve it, you probably won't like it.\n\nI won't go into TOO much detail on the plot, but suffice to say the game takes a turn at the halfway point, and the mechanics do so as well.\n\nThat said I actually like it a bit BETTER than the source material. The characters are much more fleshed out and less one-dimensional, especially Lavinia and Jessie, who in the novel were \"a rich bully and her hanger-on.\" Lavinia becomes a much more complicated character, and Jessie actually GETS a character.\n\nAbout the only disappointment is that some of the stories needed a bit more time to develop. Jessie and Mariette's work out fine, but Lavinia probably could have used a few extra scenes since she undergoes the most drastic change.\n\nAlso there's a lack of a \"golden ending,\" you have to pick ONE path to the end, and it's more of a sidestory. The game ends the same way the book does, though Sara may get one more additional companion if she chooses someone other than Mariette or Becky (they go with her no matter what).\n\nAnd, uh, that brings me to the last point. The sorta elephant in the room: I haven't finished ALL the routes, only half, but 2/3 of those are effectively lesbian love stories. Naturally I'd imagine the total number of lesbians would be 4 out of the 6, as Mariette's too old and Lottie's too young, but I've been wrong before. Safe to say, though, Jessie's definitely a lesbian in this version, and Lavinia's probably Sara-sexual. Though given Sara's personality, it could just be them attracted to HER specifically.\n\nBecause...maybe it's just because my experience with the source material is primarily the film adaptations (where the dad is kept alive. Spoiler alert for a 110 year old book: He really IS dead in the novel) and maybe it's the perspective and choice given to you, the player...but Sara feels a little stronger here.\n\nAnyway, in short, I recommend this VN. It's the type of thing I'd like to see more of: retellings of classic stories that give the player more control over events. It would certainly help mitigate possible plotholes.", "timestamp_created": 1464027405, "timestamp_updated": 1464027405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

So I shall give a review for all people pondering to buy this game.\n(Note: I have not yet finished the game so I cannot give a full review as of now.)\n\n[h1] Art and Appearence [/h1]\nThe art style is a mix of Victorian and Anime/Manga. I completely enjoy the art style and find it as a relaxing overlook to the more serious moments in game. The appearence of the game is calming. My only problem with it is the backrounds are a bit too whimsical for my taste. (Again, this is my personal prefrence. So, if you enjoy it I can understand. I just think it dosen't fit the tone of the game.)\n\n[h1] Music and Sounds [/h1]\nThe music is nice piano music that I like. (If you don't like classical you won't like this music.) Along with other orchestral music. It fits the Victorian scene, if you ask me. I personaly like it. (After playing for a while it does get a bit overused.)\n\n[h1] Characters [/h1]\nSome are quite bland but, most are interesting and you can connect with them. My personal favorite is Lottie. (SHE'S CUTE... OKAY. I LIKE CUTE THINGS...) But, in all seriousness I realy like the characters and I think the studio did a good job.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nIF YOU READ THE LITTLE PRINCESS AND LIKED IT YOU WILL LOVE THIS. LIKE SERIOUSLY.

Might be the most precious game I've played.\n\n[h1][u]Art & Music[/u][/h1]\nYou only need to look at the screenshots of the game to see that it has really beautiful art, with well-drawn backgrounds and character portraits that work together really well. The specific aspect that bumps this up though are CGs. They look amazing blown up on my widescreen monitor where all the little details can be easily pointed out. It must also be said that the same goes for the rest of the game. At least on my machine, it ran full widescreen with no indication of any stretched images, which for some reason is not as common as I would like in other works of the same genre. This game aced this part. I'm not really very good at describing music, but I have to say that this one tugged at my heartstrings way too often (to the point of abuse really). It fits the individual moments perfectly with every sense of dread, sadness, glee, or just plain heartwarming moments that make you go \"d'awwww\" while holding back tears. That won't work though, I tried, too many times.\n\n[h1][u] Story & Gameplay[/u][/h1]\nThe story was paced really well and I didn't feel at any time in the game that it was moving too quickly or dragged out. Oh, and for people who haven't actually read the original novel this game was based on, do yourself the favor of not reading the story description as it contains a bit too much hints that I would've liked. Trust me, when THAT moment happens in the game, it'll be just a little bit more impactful, at least it was for me as someone who had no idea what was going to happen.[spoiler](although I did sort of see it coming anyways, the way it was executed was still so good that I was genuinely suprised still).[/spoiler] The writing is also excellent as it matches the setting of the game and gives enough flavor that no line would seem uninteresting or something to be skipped. I must also say that the writing is special in the sense that it could make the most simplest of lines sound so touching and heartwarming or heartbreaking. Again, paired with the music this REALLY leaves an impact. Gameplay wise, think Long Live the Queen except you won't be stressed out whatsoever. No need to stress your head on this one folks, just do what you think is the most optimal way and it probably is. Even if it's not, it'll still go well anyways. It's stat raising in order to meet requirements to progress on the different routes of the game. Although, I believe there's still one route that is unlocked even if you don't invest in it. So even if you don't bother with the gameplay and skip most of that, you'll still reach the end relatively unscathed. \n\n[h1][u]Characters[/u][/h1]\nI'll just put this here separately as an emphasis on the fact that I LOVED every character that was supposed to be loved and I HATED the characters that were supposed to be hated. That's all really -- every one was fleshed out, had depth, and no one of value seemed flat. [spoiler] Regarding Miss Michin and Cook, I don't think those even counted as human beings so they kind of don't count.[/spoiler]\n\nAddendum: Hmm...what else can I say...oh yes. This cute little girl protagonist is a braver person and a better ladykiller than I can ever hope to be. I cried more than she did while playing through just one route. So yeah, there's that.", "timestamp_created": 1463687017, "timestamp_updated": 1463687640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.732440", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23085830": {"recommendationid": "23085830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007983674", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463759370}, "language": "english", "review": "A wonderful little Visual Novel based on the beloved turn-of-the-century novel in which you follow Sara, a quiet, imaginative, and kind young lady raised in India and sent away to England for schooling. The game features some light stat-raising elements and very light decision making, but it is primarily a linear story with optional events. In the second half of the game, the story divides into 6 distinct routes, each leading to a unique ending. The avaliblity of the routes depends on your actions in the first half of the story, so multiple playthroughs of the first act are required to see all the routes; fortunately, the game includes to option to skip through already-viewed scenes.\n\nThe writing is thoroughly enjoyable and adorable. Some of the routes feature light romantic elements, but not all of them do; you will find a range of different relationships from good friends, to nuturing parental figure, to sweetly romantic. \n\nOverall, a highly recommended VN, particularly if you're ok with something lighter on gameplay and focusing on narrative. If you're looking for a Princess Maker-style stat raiser, on the other hand, this one might not be for you.\n\nNote: This game was originally purchased directly from the developer and this review was posted immediately following the pre-Steam release beta period, so hours played might not line up with the actual length of this game.", "timestamp_created": 1463683910, "timestamp_updated": 1463683910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.809424", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 135, "total_negative": 9, "total_reviews": 144}}

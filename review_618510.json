You are pink and they are blue. You get a gun to eradicate them.

Which then pile up, making the level have a different terrain. It's not really good or bad, but it is defintely interesting and could make an amazing game if the dev's decide to expand on that idea.\n\nOn the same note as making bone mountains, you can blow up the ground and have dips. This is only really important on the lava level, because the lava hurts you. More importanlty, it hurts the braindead blue guys because they run straight into it if they're chasing you. \n\nSadly, the dips and mountains don't seem to actually affect the gun fire. There's a chance it does, but the game is so fast and hectic that you won't notice a bullet or two hitting the mountain instead of a random blue guy anyway.\n\nAll in all, this game is worth a buck. \n\nPS:Ii watched the trailer.

Thankfully, the physics in Battle Bruise have no sense of self-respect, and thus you can sometimes hit the zombies while standing on the highground and shooting horizontally. Simply glorious.\n\nThe few downsides are that the game has no endless mode or multiplayer, and it's quite short, you can easily beat it on one night.

This top-down shooter is proven to have plenty of fun in a low, low price. Gameplay consists of 2 main modes with several levels and 2 different weapon sets: a main Campaign with three waves per level and a Car Defense mode with 8 waves per level. Campaign is all about surviving a horde of zombies while car defense is as it's named (and can be brutal at times). Inbetween waves you can spend some money getting new weapons and upgrading current ones (and buy turrets in car defense). During the course of these swarmfest there are power-ups that can help make things easier (note that Freeze only affects the enemies that have spawned at the moment it's picked up). What's also neat is that enemy corpses can fill the landscape and change the terrain everyone walks on. Not to mention it can be reduced by either explosions, the Nuke, elephants or the dashng slash. Controls are as simple as a PC shooter can be (WASD move, mouse aim and fires, numbers and scroll wheel selects weapons), but I do like the addition of a dashing slash (right click) that can help you get out of being crowded. What's sad is that although the game recognize my 360 controller I can't aim with the right stick. That needs to be fixed. The visuals are pretty basic with a nice art style. It's got that cool art style like it came from a punk kid's notebook. The audio's pretty good too. Although my only major gripe is how weak some sounds can be. But what got me intrigued is the dynamic music. The tunes sounded basic at first, but as more zombies flood the battlefield, they kick it up a notch, bringing out guitars, keyboards, etc. It's not often you find a game with dynamic music, especially from a 1 dollar game. Overall, I think it's definitely worth the dollar.", "timestamp_created": 1508055939, "timestamp_updated": 1508055939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35730261": {"recommendationid": "35730261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198404617311", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508699899}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun shoot'em up.

It is interesting graphic wise. It is decent fun for its size. The changing geography of the map is a super interesting mechanic... However... There's very few types of enemies, the balancing is attrocious, the game does nothing to explain anything, it is also very short.\nIf it eventually has some overhauling patch that adds some permanent upgrades, more stages, balancing, etc, this game gets strongly recommended. For now, however, it is only worth it if it is not full price and you can at least make your money back with the cards and get some easy achievements.", "timestamp_created": 1500005267, "timestamp_updated": 1500005267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33463806": {"recommendationid": "33463806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014353729", "num_games_owned": 402, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499845463}, "language": "english", "review": "For $0.34 (Had a 66% off coupon) It's not a bad little arcade shooter.

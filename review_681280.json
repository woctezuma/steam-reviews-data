There are four terrain types each with it's own style, unique ramps and final \"boss jump\". These boss jumps are larger than life jumps each with it's own flavour that must be beaten three times to unlock a short cut to begin your run in each of the terrain types.\n\nThe game can be pretty challenging and the points loss for crashing is pretty severe in the career mode but that really doesn't matter as you hurl your way down a course, pulling off stunts with deft use of left and right stick while nodding your head to the great (assuming you like fairly floaty DnB) soundtrack. The sense of speed, the risk, the easy-to-understand-hard-to-master controls, all combine to make for a great time.\n\nThe game is technically in early access but there are no glaring technical bugs or performance issues (Ryzen 5 1600 / 1060 6gb). Content could be argued to be slim but the procedural generation of the tracks makes for a reasonable amount of replayability. The devs also seem committed to adding additional content and have already added a free run mode where you can tailor the course generation parameters or even just use a typed seed. They have also teased a park type level with half pipes and the like. If and when they do I will definitely pick it up again and play some more. \n\nAll in all, a really good game that with some additional content capitalising on the great stunt controls could be on the cusp of being truly great.", "timestamp_created": 1521059870, "timestamp_updated": 1521059870, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40797815": {"recommendationid": "40797815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100987791", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 237, "last_played": 1521333021}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc544\uc9c1 \ucee8\ud150\uce20\ub294 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1520981451, "timestamp_updated": 1520981451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40792211": {"recommendationid": "40792211", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981931081", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 361, "last_played": 1521750824}, "language": "french", "review": "Bon jeu qui apparement est tr\u00e9s bien suivis par ces d\u00e9veloppeurs qui ajoutent du contenu au fur et a mesure :)", "timestamp_created": 1520962494, "timestamp_updated": 1520963676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40779078": {"recommendationid": "40779078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028984388", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 93, "last_played": 1520911177}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game and concept but performance on my set up is kinda wonky and have encountered a few crashes.\n\nWill HIGHLY consider buying it again should performance issues are addressed.\n\nSpecs are as followed:\ni7 7700k\n16gb DDR4 RAM\nEVGA GTX 1050Ti SSC \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1520912636, "timestamp_updated": 1520912636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40776898": {"recommendationid": "40776898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198187870098", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 92, "last_played": 1521042335}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is super fun, I love the addition of seeds.

But it would have been nice to be able to do Bar Spins or Tail Whips and an available score-attack based trick mode similar to the Hoffman series.\u00a0\u00a0 However this might have also added some complexity to the controls and made it harder for extreme sports game rookies to learn the game.\n\nDescenders is an easily recommended package to anyone feeling burnt by the lack of extreme sports games on today\u2019s market.\u00a0 With the absence of Skate, Tony Hawk, and SSX there is an absolute dearth of titles like these currently available.\u00a0 Steep is fun but if you\u2019re looking for something with a bit more manic-energy and variety of locales, Descenders might have what you want.\u00a0 I\u2019ve sunk a lot of time into this game and am absolutely stoked to see how Rage Squid iterates on this very solid foundation.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1519819535, "timestamp_updated": 1519819535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40455145": {"recommendationid": "40455145", "author": {"steamid": "76561198387507344", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519965679}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u8981\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u8f86Glory \u6211\u4f1a\u6454\u8f66\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1519800583, "timestamp_updated": 1519800583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40451366": {"recommendationid": "40451366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799713386", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 199, "last_played": 1521400152}, "language": "english", "review": "just wow! this game is amazing super fun to play and the rewards are great! i recommed a decent spec pc or mac this game looks and will run amazing with a great pc!! the stunts and controls are easy and fun! the forset is def. the hards of the maps i would recommd this game to anyone!! great deal and great game!!", "timestamp_created": 1519784510, "timestamp_updated": 1519784510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40448363": {"recommendationid": "40448363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000203126", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520096684}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game so far.

Every single boss jump besides Canyon has some bullshit specific set up to actually land in the 3 centimeter sweet spot where your character doesn't just bite the cyanide pill in his tooth. \n\nAlso let's not forget that if your character so much as stubs his toe on literally anything you will throw yourself off your bike in some true Saints Row 3 Insurance Fraud level shit\n\n\nI have played more than 9 hours of this game and no matter how many different ways I try to do it I can't land the forest boss jump. Go as fast as humanly possible? You'll overshoot and die. Slow down a little? You'll hit the side of the building. Slow yourself down by holding up on the right trigger? You'll still hit the building. I've tried 70 km/s, 65 km/s 60 km/s 55 km/s. None of them work. Either you fall one inch too far and break every bone in your glass body or you land on the roof. And If you're lucky you'll land far enough back on the 10 foot roof to jump off and land on the ramp on the other side. That's honestly the best way I've found to beat the jump, and it's still inconsistent. \n\nA lot of the randomly generated maps are garbage. Not only can you not see whats on the other side of a ramp once you go over it, but a lot of the time it will just throw you off the course and into the woods unless you slow down to a crawl for every jump. \n\nJust all of the level design in the forest is awful. There are no chances to build speed. Every on a map with NO curves on the selection screen, you will still be bombarded by trees you can't see around a corner until you smash yourself on it. Unless you of course just slow down enough to where the game isn't even fun. \n\nIt's not fast paced downhill mountain biking. Its downhill 10 mile per hour skipping all the jumps because its the best way to beat the game biking. \n\nNo matter how many times I do the same jumps and the same corners, there is no consistency. You will still die more times trying to earn lives on the later levels its not even worth doing. Oh yeah a level with no ramps? Let me just do a quick 720 in the middle of this assfuck of trees infested forest.\n\n\n\nHERES HOW YOU GET INFINITE SCORE\n\n1. Complete every bonus on the first stage\n2. Skip everything in the forest. Everything. Don't do jumps. Don't go fast. Don't even do the boss jumps.\n3. Guess what? Skip everything in the canyon too. Luckily this stage doesn't have as much trash as the forest so you can try to complete some bonuses here. Although there are still jumps you literally cannot make with the level layout so be careful of that.\n4. Peaks? Skip it. Just ride around every obstacle because right now that is how you beat the game. And you better pray to whatever god you worship you stacked enough lives to get through this garbage fire of a boss jump. I literally have played almost 10 hours and I not once have managed to find any consistent set up to beat this jump.\n5. There you go.

Never again would I play a roguelike or rougelite game. My blood pressure couldnt handle it, nor could the countless controllers and keyboards that had been smashed handle it.

I was free, free to enjoy the anger free life I had always dreamed of. I woke up with gladness in my heart knowing my children will never be subject to the horrors of failure in Dark Souls. They will never have to break a computer screen or keyboard over such tear inducing games as Darkest Dungeon..... But wait... What is this? A cycling game? Bright colors and gorgeous greenery. It feels as though the wind is really flying up the legs of my shorts... And then it hits me... or rather I hit it. A small wooden peg.... again... and again... sadly failing to make it past the first stage. I watch as my hard work from previous rounds gets thrown away through my reduction in points. I try... and try again.. only to take one step forward and two steps back. Everynow and again ill take two or three steps forward and a single step back. This has been the source of my ruin. Beware... Even the most casual of players may now find themselves saying... Just one more round... Ill gain all those points back in a steep straight race.... just one more round....", "timestamp_created": 1519597939, "timestamp_updated": 1519598056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507590", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40399556": {"recommendationid": "40399556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024228182", "num_games_owned": 886, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 74, "last_played": 1520953362}, "language": "english", "review": "it good", "timestamp_created": 1519591403, "timestamp_updated": 1519591403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40399532": {"recommendationid": "40399532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128030405", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2489, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 94, "last_played": 1521144593}, "language": "english", "review": "Mike asked me to write this or he will find me...

It's hard to complete all but possible. \n- Add a timer so you can't just keep going back up the hill and repeating jumps/challenges. \n- As you go through each run you get more powerful but the levels get harder. Your stats reset after each level though. \n- Bikes, Gear and maybe Characters dictate your starting stats (adds progression outside of each run). You could have a characater with low starting health but high stats,  or visa versa. \n- Bosses can be more than just jumps, maybe hard tricks or bigger versions of the stone henge and castle. \n- I would prefer having a REP (or different scoring system) for each run so you can compare runs.

This promotes a play style that is very conservative within the game, meaning that you are less likely to try and go for big tricks or to try and play the later stages as the net gain for rep isnt there. This is compounded by the fact that there is no true practice mode, and by that I mean there is apractice mode, but it adheres to the same 5 life system the the standard mode does, meaning that after bailing out, you have to load into a new level, and try and practice with the 5 lives you have, this is very limiting as it stops you from trying out massive tricks or trying to do funky things, as you as less inclined to do so, despite there being no rep loss within practice mode.\n\nIf the practice mode had infinite lives, allowing for more experimentation within the mode as well as having a wider more diverse hub area, as at the moment there are 4 paths, with 2 having ramps, but there is only 2 sets of ramps in each, limiting what can be done within the hub area.\n\nDespite this, i would still recommend this game to anyone, as it can be fun to just jam, doing tricks and things, but the rep system forces you to play slow and the practice mode is a little underwhelming.", "timestamp_created": 1519479185, "timestamp_updated": 1519479185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40352505": {"recommendationid": "40352505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083767906", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519896856}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u97f3\u4e50\u548c\u753b\u9762\u597d\u8bc4\uff1b\n\u4f5c\u4e3aEA\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5df2\u7ecf\u5341\u5206\u6210\u719f\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff1b\nRogue-Lite\u5143\u7d20\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u91cd\u590d\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u751f\u547d\u503c\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u7cbe\u5de7\u4e00\u70b9\uff08\u6162\u60a0\u60a0\u649e\u4e0a\u4e00\u5757\u77f3\u5934\u548c\u5728\u7a7a\u4e2d\u649e\u4e0a\u706b\u8f66\u603b\u4e0d\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u679c\u5427\uff09\n\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u66f4\u65b0\u5f88\u52e4\u5feb\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u671f\u5f85\u6b63\u5f0f\u7248\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1519467795, "timestamp_updated": 1519467795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40350633": {"recommendationid": "40350633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069220569", "num_games_owned": 661, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519462315}, "language": "german", "review": "das spiel ist sehr geil besser alls jedes andere DIrtbike Downhill Spiel Grafik ist super steuerung k\u00f6nnte bisschen besser sein sound vom bike ist recht leise der preis f\u00fcr early access ist zu teuer k\u00f6nnte billiger sein der jetzige preis ist der preis was es kostetn sollte wenns fertig ist ich h\u00e4tte es billiger sesetzt es macht durch aus sehr viel spa\u00df dennoch werde ichs mir erst wieder holen wenns komplett fertig ist .", "timestamp_created": 1519462601, "timestamp_updated": 1519462601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40350472": {"recommendationid": "40350472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140242081", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 62, "last_played": 1520664204}, "language": "english", "review": "great music, nice gameplay.

"english", "review": "Hi my name is Dean, professional idiot! It is time for me to review this game now, sorry about that! \n\n \n\nBasics \n\nThere are three teams in the game and its very important to choose carefully which team you play with, since there will be team specific nodes on the map which will determine what type of level you get. All levels are randomly generated and usually you get to choose one of three levels to go through, it\u2019s a bit like Outrun in choosing your path, some will be locked off afterwards. At the end of each area there is a killer boss jump you must complete to go to the next area and the areas get harder the more you progress. Not only do they get harder but they are different from each other too, hopefully we will get more areas, track pieces and those daily challenges eventually. \n\n \n\nTeams \n\nEnemy (Red Bros) This is the stunt team and they get stunt track nodes, pretty fun. \n\nArboreal (Green Bros) This team the track is a suggestion and their nodes are probably the weakest since its just open land and that land is quite baron. They need some natural stuff to trick off in these areas and is the weakest team. \n\nKinetic (Blue Bros) the SAAAAAANIC TEAM, GOTTA GO FAAAAAST! \n\n \n\nLives, Scoring and Tricks \n\nScore or REP is obtained by going fast, doing tricks and completing boss jumps which give huge bonus. Every time you bail you lose 5% of your REP, you can even start going backwards if you get a RKO out of nowhere from RANDY ROCKON! \"BY GAWD MAGGLE\". So choosing what stunts to preform where and when to play it safe is really, REALLY important in this game. Since your rank is tied to your REP and at higher ranks you really do not want to fall off your bike, think of it as ELO rather than a traditional levelling up system.  \n\n \n\nLosing all lives \u20135% REP. \n\nRetiring \u20132% REP. This is sometimes useful if you get an awful track and you don\u2019t want to lose more lives and rep doing this node. It is better to save lives and rep and ditch 2% than multiple 5%'s . \n\nFinishing an area and choosing not to continue to the next are 0% REP LOSS! This is really good if your running low on lives and just want to cash in what you have, its part of the risk / reward system. \n\n \n\nTricks are good and responsive in this game, feel very fluid. The only thing I would suggest is allow us to go backwards at a complete stop, I really don\u2019t want to hug a tree that badly! There are advance tricks lick holding the right stick up when falling from Hight to try not to die. There also is this really cool trick which isn't in the advanced section (naughty devs). It is like a pre-wind when in the air hold the left stick to the right and hold the right stick to the left. Then what you do is hold the right stick to the right and you will spin faster two the right, just mirror this if you want to spin left instead! \n\n \n\nControls \n\nNo key bindings just yet, very naughty! Devs promised they will be put in soon though, it is suggested to play with a twin stick controller though. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! \n\n \n\nLoot System \n\nThe loot in this game is random after you finish a game of it, the better you do in game the better chance of a rare piece of clothing or a bike dropping. I love this idea, it's like a loot box, but not of money and of gameplay very nice. Get over 50k in one run and you have the highest chance of an elite item, cool! :) \n\n \n\nSuggestions \n\n*Grinding or sliding on narrow poles would be fun, maybe some pegs? I know you wouldn\u2019t be able to slide with them but could be an interesting bike mod that you could take or not? \n\n*Arboreal Nodes need to be better as a part of the green bros these tracks are not very fun and rather bland. Making your path is fine, but when it is just an open field with a few rocks and trees it's not that good. \n\n*Secret area for people that ironman the first four stages? Like a secret 5th stage would be mint, or just more area and track pieces in general. Just go nuts adding new things to trick off of and things to do make it truly special! \n\n*Map seeds would be good, let's say if you find a track you really love save the seed and share with friends! I know it's not a map editor but its more realistic option and if we could get it, it would be amazing. \n\n*Replays would be nice if you have a really sick run going, we could even make a YouTube video with replays, that would be nice. \n\n \n\nFinal Thoughts \n\nThis game is amazing, as long as the devs keep adding more to this game, this game may be near perfect! I love its pick up and play nature and that one more go vibe to it. The music is fantastic, wish we could get some Jungle music in there! \ud83d\ude09 It also runs really nice too, I wish the devs the best of luck, this is truly a fun game.", "timestamp_created": 1518957823, "timestamp_updated": 1518957823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40181162": {"recommendationid": "40181162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025213720", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519471088}, "language": "english", "review": "I suck at this game!! :D\n\nIf you're looking for an addicting, satisfying, and actually challenging speed game, this is for you.\n\nPros:\nAWESOME SOUNDTRACK (Thanks to Liquicity, and how I received a key)\nAmazing sense of speed and impact\nHigh skill curve (You will suck hard at this game, but you will like it)\nDecent tutorial that easily introduces you to the game mechanics\nExtremely fluid level generation, all tracks have seamless continuity at all difficulty levels\nGenerally very polished\nOne of the best First Person Views I've ever played on\n\nAreas of Development:\nHaybales are set to Seek And Destroy\nRep system is very unforgiving to players for getting hurt, with high percentage decreases, encouraging low risk play\nKeyboard controls are not reconfigurable yet\nLoading screens last a little long between levels\n\nOverall this is a solid game already, can't believe how polished the game is.

The sense of speed you get is great. The level of challenge in the game is varied. If you want to go down a track at full speed in the easiest environment, it feels very different than in the final environment. The sense of accomplishment that you get from pulling off a boss jump or finishing a level without braking is exhilarating. The controls are intuitive and the music is enticing. Once you start playing you do not want to stop.\n\nThis game is in a strong state for being early access. The game has only crashed once so far for me. The procedural generation on the levels works well the vast majority of the time. The levels that are generated feel unique and fresh. The content is sufficient: the environments all have their own feel and unique obstacles. The controls and gamplay are strong.\n\nThere are a some things that detract from the experience. A few times that I have seen, the ramps will spawn inside the track. This doesn't effect the gameplay that much because you can go off the track. The goals for getting extra lives don't always line up to the track's features. They are determined before you pick your track but even with a few to pick from, you might not always find a suitable track.\n\nI can see many ways for this game to improve. There could be more obstacles and ramps added. The area off the track could be made to look and feel more exciting. More tricks could be added to the simple spins and flips that are available now. The developers have also said that they might work on mulitplayer and I would love to see that be finished. So far the team system feels pretty inconsequential and that could be expanded upon.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game. I think that it is fully playable and enjoyable in its current state.

The gameplay runs great and I've had no frame dips at all yet. Using a controller is highly reccomended, keyboard is far too dificult. The game looks great and has many pros. Some of these pros include the whole level design being procedurely generated. It adds a whole new feel to it and allows you to play the same type of levels over and over and have different courses each time. The four current stages are plenty for an Early Access game. The four different \"stages\" are the hillside, forest, canyon, and mountains. The hillside is a more mellow, learning-the-game type of level. The forest is a larger step up in skill, including small groups of logs you have to jump over and many other things. The canyon has a lot more speed but is a lot more open compared to the rest. The last stage is by far the most difficult one. I don't have a lot of info on it because i messed up a lot but you can take my word, it's hard. You can experience various different rating on courses, like one that has a lot of stunts and is steep, or one that has a lot of curves and isnt too stunty. Every one of the three main features of the cours (steep, curves, and stunts) can all be at 0 or maxed out. The stage selection also works well in each level, you start doing one race and after that you can branch off to 3 more. After choosing one of those, you get 3 more courses. AFter completing one of the new 3, the total courses in that section goes back down to 3, giving you 1 race or possibly all 3 races. The final race in each level is a \"boss\" jump, special for each stage. The bit of course before the jump is random, but the jump is the same thing every time you play that certain boss jump. For example, if you jump over one thing and make it first try, then the next time you jump it, you get the same jump, but a different course before it. It keeps the jump the same but still adds that spice of difference between each run you do. Another good thing this game has is reputation, or a level system. The more tricks you do and the cooler they are, the more rep you get. But, if you mess up badly, you can lose a lot of rep from it and possibly derank. The final good thing I want to mention is the practice mode. This lets you practice on certain stages and not lose rep. The two things I think shouldn't be in this practice mode are the fact that you still have lives and can't skip directly to the boss or choose, for say, the final stage unless you beat the boss challenge 3 times. For the cons, a lot of people say the price is too high. Currently, yes I would say $22.50 is a lot for the type of game it is currently, but it is in Early Access. The game will develope and have more stages and a lot more in general, balincing what you get for your money. One annoying thing I did find was the challenges, which can become quite difficult, especially in the forest I found. In the forest, there are a lot more non-ramp stunts to perform, so having to do 2 360s becomes quite difficult. So take that as you wish, I do reccomend the game and especially use a controller when playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1518559433, "timestamp_updated": 1518559433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528609", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40052442": {"recommendationid": "40052442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009517539", "num_games_owned": 1696, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518562928}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u521a\u4e70\u4e86\u6682\u65f6\u8fd8\u6ca1\u65f6\u95f4\u73a9\u592a\u591a\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u8fd8\u4e0d\u592a\u591a\u3002\u800c\u4e14\u56e0\u4e3a\u6b64\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u5f88\u5c11\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5f88\u591a\u5730\u65b9\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u70ed\u95e8\u7684Steep\u4f5c\u4e00\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f9b\u5927\u5bb6\u53c2\u8003\u3002(\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u6ca1\u6709\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u6ca1\u73a9\u8fc7\u8fd8\u5728\u89c2\u671b\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\u7c7b\u6bd4\u4e00\u4e0b\u67d0\u4e9b\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff09\n\n[h1] \u753b\u9762\uff1a[/h1]\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u753b\u9762\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a5\u53d7\u3002\u4f46\u5168\u7279\u6548\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f9d\u7136\u8ddd\u79bb\u5546\u5e97\u7684\u622a\u56fe\u8fd8\u5dee\u4e00\u70b9\u2026\u2026 \u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u6211\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\n[h1] \u52a8\u4f5c\uff1a[/h1]\u6d41\u7545\u5ea6\u6ee1\u5206\uff0c\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u6781\u5f3a\u3002\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7c7b\u4f3csteep\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6309\u952e\u5e76\u4e0d\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u5341\u5206\u9700\u8981\u624b\u611f\uff0c\u60f3\u73a9\u5f97\u723d\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u5f88\u591a\u7ec3\u4e60\uff0c\u4e0d\u7ba1\u662f\u5b8c\u6210\u4e00\u6b21\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u7ade\u901f\u8d5b\u8fd8\u662f\u6f02\u4eae\u5e05\u6c14\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u82b1\u5f0f\u52a8\u4f5c\u90fd\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6210\u5c31\u611f\u548c\u89c2\u8d4f\u6027\u3002\n[h1] \u73a9\u6cd5\uff1a[/h1]\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u73a9\u6cd5\u5f88\u5c11\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4e5f\u4e0d\u50cfsteep\u90a3\u6837\u662f\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u3002\u4f46\u597d\u5728\u662f\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8d5b\u9053\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u6761\u4e0d\u5bb9\u6613\u6454\u8de4\u7684\u8fd1\u8def\u76f4\u5954\u7ec8\u70b9\u4e5f\u7b97\u672c\u4e8b\u3002\u603b\u4e4b\u975e\u5e38\u9002\u5408\u53cd\u590d\u6e38\u73a9\u3002\u552f\u4e00\u8ba9\u4eba\u6709\u4e9b\u4e0d\u6ee1\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5728steep\u91cc\u9762\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u542c\u7740\u6b4c\uff0c\u6f2b\u65e0\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u968f\u5fc3\u6240\u6b32\u6454\u6454\u6454\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u672c\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6454\u8de4\u662f\u4f1a\u4e2d\u65ad\u5f53\u524d\u8fdb\u5ea6\u7684\uff08\u88ab\u5f3a\u5236\u62c9\u56de\u8d5b\u9053\u91cd\u65b0\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u50cf\u5176\u4ed6\u4f20\u7edf\u4f53\u80b2\u7ade\u901f\u6e38\u620f\u4e00\u6837\uff09\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u4ee5\u540e\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u7985\u6a21\u5f0f\u6216\u8005\u8bf4\u662f\u65e0\u5c3d\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f9b\u5927\u5bb6\u81ea\u7531\u653e\u677e\uff0c\u4e0d\u7528\u4e00\u76f4\u90a3\u4e48\u7d27\u5f20\u3002\n[h1] \u97f3\u4e50\uff1a[/h1]\u5bf9\u6211\u4e2a\u4eba\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u97f3\u4e50\u6bd4steep\u66f4\u80dc\u4e00\u7b79\u3002\u6211\u6ca1\u8bb0\u9519\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u539f\u672c\u7684\u82f1\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e2d\u662f\u6709\u5bf9\u7535\u97f3\u5382\u724c/DJ\u7684\u7b80\u4ecb\u7684\uff0c\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u4e13\u95e8\u5bf9\u672c\u6e38\u620f\u539f\u521b\u7684\u3002\u53cd\u89c2steep\u6709\u4e9b\u97f3\u4e50\u8ba9\u4eba\u542c\u7740\u5f88\u96be\u53d7\uff08\u6bd4\u5982winter fest\u7684\u90a3\u51e0\u9996\u66f2\u5b50\uff0c\u8ba9\u4eba\u8d8a\u542c\u8d8a\u60f3\u6454\uff09\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e0d\u80fd\u5207\u6b4c\u9009\u6b4c\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u65f6\u5019\u53ea\u80fd\u5173\u6389\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u97f3\u4e50\uff0c\u7528\u64ad\u653e\u5668\u5728\u540e\u53f0\u653e\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u3002\n\n\u76ee\u524d\u672c\u6e38\u620f\u8fd8\u662f\u521d\u767bEA\uff0c\u6709\u6b64\u7d20\u8d28\u771f\u7684\u975e\u5e38\u68d2\u4e86\u3002\u53cd\u6b63\u4e0d\u559c\u6b22\u53ef\u4ee5\u9000\u6b3e\uff0c\u559c\u6b22steep\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u4eec\u4e0d\u59a8\u4e70\u6765\u8bd5\u73a9\u4e00\u4e0b\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1518549193, "timestamp_updated": 1518555540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40052346": {"recommendationid": "40052346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050863170", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518547720}, "language": "english", "review": "This game crashed while I was playing it.

"I want to like this game. It has potential. However, the same claim to fame is its greatest short coming. The procedurally generated levels are some of the worst. Especially combined with the bonus system, in a majority of cases the bonus has literally no connection to the generated map. (I would think that the reliability should be high). Yet I only feel a slight agitation on the inconsistent level decisions. After the first stage \"the highlands\" the reliability for bonuses drops. For instant the Forest level would benefit from steep down hills and massive jumps or straight B line shots for speed. Yet every stage on the map is switch back gates and pits. But the bonus supports either speed or jump tricks. The variation that\u2019s being touted is nonexistent versus the actual play. Sure, it\u2019s nice having a fresh stage every time you play, but when its inconsistent with your own system it becomes frustrating. Eventually your just grinding stages at the slowest or safest maneuvers to saves lives for the boss jump for progression.  Wouldn\u2019t it be better If the stages invited risk over reward?  Again, I want to like it, but it suffers from multiple fatal flaws.  No time trials or speed attack stages, and loot or skins are given only for progression. What about multi player stages?

Either bomb it, or ride the brakes. It's all up to you, but keep in mind that the game makes you push the limits if you want to advance to the next area. There are 4 areas (5 if you count the starting/training area), and I have yet to even get passed the 3rd area after just unlocking the shortcut to the forest. The health/reputation (experience) system is a great dynamic for this game, as with a more passive approach, you can save all your health for the final boss jumps at the cost of a slower rep gain. The physics are great, and it gives off an arcade vibe, which is perfect for flying down the trails. If you enjoy challenging yourself, then this game is for you. Huge potential in this game, and I'd say it's definitely worth the money even at this stage in early access.

Sometimes it would be nice to watch your ride again with some different camera angels.\n- Multiplayer\n- Open world in every different area to just ride and play around in (not super necessary though)\n- More character and bike custumizations\n- BMX bikes\n\nI think thats it.

[/h1]\nThis game is soo much fun to play. Keep it going guys! U're doing it right.\n\n\n[b][u] Audio [/u][/b] 9/10  U should add more of this music style and chance the \"next music\" button to something on d-pad cuz l2 and r1 isnt good when u have a challenge without breaking\n\n[b][u] Video [/u][/b] 10/10  This graphics really fits in this game. On Gtx 1060 i5 6500 and 16 gb around 90 fps but in the forrest level there are some drops to 40 but its playable. U can ride into the shed so u can customize bike and your character. Its cool! (Ofc u can do that from options menu)\n\n[b][u] Gameplay [/u][/b] 11/10 Hooo Lee Fuk I've never played a game like this before cuz noone did such a great job!!!!! Downhill is fantastic soo yeah. Random level generator are quite good. Steering is good, and the controls are simple. Lifes mechanics fits soo great in this kind of game.\n\n[b][u] Optimalization [/u][/b] 9/10 As i said. There are some drops on forrest on max settings.\n\n[b][u] Overall [/u][/b] 10/10  11.02.2018 This game have 3 days so content wont be big. SUPPORT RageSquid  by buying this game. U won't regret it!\n\n[h1]IDEAS WHAT U SHOULD DO NEXT TO THIS GAME[/h1]\n\n- Change \"change of music\" button to something on d-pad. As i said its not comfortable on LT+RB\n\n-Add reverse on LT too cuz its easy to stuck while u can't reverse\n\n-Add more soundtrack to the game. This music style fits well.\n\n- Add more bike customization\n[list]\n[*]suspension                        \n[*]grips                                  \n[*]rims\n[*]tyres \n[*]hubs\n[*]pedals\n[*]chain\n[*]spoke\n[*]saddle\n[*]brake cables\n[*]front and rear bike lights\n[*]brakes\n[*]derailleur\n[/list]\n\nIt could be good if those parts could affect on handling of the bike. If the bike could be lighter and the suspension softer, or tyres thread would make less/more \"drifty\" \n\n-Some sort of endless mode where player can adjust the steepnes, curvy and stunt bar. It could generate endless terrain that player could ride. Some kind of practice mode or something. Without lifes of course.\n\n-Steam workshop soo players could make maps, bike livery, outfits.\n\n-More weathers\n[list]\n[*]It could affect on bike handling\n[/list]\n-Night would be awesome if we were forced to have bike lights to see the track.\n\n-More map levels. (I know. The game have just 3 days. Just saying)\n\n-I'd love to see bigger place when u can ride your bike. \n\n-Multiplayer would be good. When u can ride with other players. U can add competition mode too to multiplayer. Soo players could ride one by one like in real downhill events.\n\n-Add more character customization like:\n[list]\n[*]gloves\n[*]boots\n[*]chest protectors\n[*]neck protector\n[*]knee protectors etc.\n[/list]\n\n-More sponsor teams\n\n-Carrer mode (Don't know if that would be necessary)\n\n-Some kind of special events like Redbull Rampage or RedBull Hardline or Loosefest\n\n-More tricks could be good. \n\n-Changing number on the jersey.\n\n-VIRTUAL REALITY!!!! First person would be amazing.\n\nSoo that's it. Propably. For this moment i don't know anything that could be done more to this game.\nI know that u're a small studio. If i remember correctly this game will come out 6-9 months. Maybe cuz of my ideas like 1+ year. I don't care bout this. Many ppl will agree with me. Don't do games fast, do it good, do not hurry.\nU had a good idea. Now polish it soo its gonna be a masterpiece!!! \nAdvertise her good. Trust me.

late to the party with Descenders, got an email from the publisher a few days from release offering a copy of the game for content creators.  I was excited from the moment I watched the trailer.  The sense of speed and control you have over your bike going downhill is something I haven't personally seen in a game.  You can rest assured that the trailer represents exactly what you will be doing in this game. Going fast. \n\nIf you are going to play this game, bring a controller- I couldn't imagine playing without one, seems weird to even try it without.  I used an Xbox One controller and there was even force feedback when you go over rough terrain, something common for those who play on consoles, but I play 99% PC games with keyboard & mouse.  \n\n[b]Likes:[/b]\n\n\nControl is very tight and easy to pick up and play, hard to master. This gives you a goal to get better each time you play.\n\nThe soundtrack is nice, albeit a bit repetitive if you get stuck in certain areas. Drum & Bass music is a-ok with me!\n\nThe way to play this game is first person perspective in my opinion- feels very satisfying (and terrifying at times) to pull off flips, spins, jumping big gaps in this mode. \n\n[b]Dislikes (things that need work imo)[/b]\n\nThe bonus system at times does not make sense to me. You have limited lives to complete a map (series of courses). You can gain a life by completing a task (do X amount of tricks, complete track in X secs).  Seems random, as the courses are also procedually generated but the bonus is almost never attainable for someone of a lower skill level.  Would you not need the lives more as a lower skilled player?  If you were good enough to get the bonus, you wouldn't need it.\n\nThe Forest levels were not enjoyable to me, but I've liked all the rest of the maps just fine. Lots of curves, many tracks had few ramps, and the end level (boss jump) had such an extreme challenge for me that I found myself playing the rest of the levels conservatively so I'd have all my lives for the boss jump.  \n\n[b]Features that I'd like to see:[/b]\n\nSome form of multiplayer\n\nAbility to share the seed of the procedural track you generated to compete with friends on the track\n\nTrack creator tool\n\nAs I said before, if the trailer looks good to you, this comes recommended!", "timestamp_created": 1518303699, "timestamp_updated": 1518303752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39987674": {"recommendationid": "39987674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040701302", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518734477}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall pretty great game, having a blast crashing into trees *_*", "timestamp_created": 1518300322, "timestamp_updated": 1518300322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39987408": {"recommendationid": "39987408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039136388", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518336951}, "language": "german", "review": "Nice Game!

Its not simlike at all so dont expect a lot of realism. Its not overly arcadey either like you would have seen in games like SSX tricky. You do tricks but they are flips and spins.  There is an extreme feeling of speed on the downhill steep tracks , so much so that I cant get down them most of the time. So there is a learning curve with using the steering with skids at big speeds. Also plenty of courses with minor steepness so you arent always out of control. \nIts great to see a game come along with biking and be a lot of fun done correctly. Like I said its not a simulation but it is a lot of fun. Excited to see where they take things as development goes on.\n\nIll also say this isnt so much a traditional racing game, its more of a obstacle course/survive till the end game. With the procedural generated courses it is impossible to have timed leaderboards since no one is ever on the same course so there is nothing to compare times on/with. It still feels like racing in the heat of the moment.

In my opinion, there are not to many \ndifferent objects/ramps in the game. By adding more ramps/object, it could rise the variation of tracks and the variation on the tracks, and so make the game even better.\n\nDescenders will also give you the freedom to play however you like to play the game.\nYou don't have to worry about a timelimit or go through any checkpoint, so could just ride straight to the finishline without takeing any risk or explore the map around the track.\n\nThe soundtrack is great, a bit Drum and Bass heavy.\n\nThe health-system can be challenging and gives the game it's difficulty.\nYou can take the save way and play every track in the area before you head to he boss jump or you just go straight to the boss jump with less health. It's really up to you, how challenging you want to be this game.\n\nThe only thing that i really miss is an map creator or any way to create custom content.\nCustom content can booste the community of Desceners.\n\nThis game is worth the 20\u20ac, and i hope it will go only up from here.\n\nWell thats my first \"true\" review of an game, it's kinda chaotic but who cares.", "timestamp_created": 1518252085, "timestamp_updated": 1518252085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39971653": {"recommendationid": "39971653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048619037", "num_games_owned": 518, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520491321}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoyable pick up and play.

First [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/285820/Action_Henk/]Action Henk[/url], which put you into the shoes of a fairly fat toy character who has to run fast. And now this, which has you riding bikes downhill on levels of varying steepness, with varying amounts of stunts and curvature, and scenery. \n\nThere are 3 teams you can pick at some point in the game, which influences the specific team nodes you'll get. Enemy is more stunt-oriented, Arboreal loves the off-road, and Kinetic is all about the speed. Despite your allegiance to a team, however, there's really all 3 of each team in us - just in differing quantities.\n\nI honestly never thought I wanted a rogue-bike until this game was announced (and playing the beta got me even more hyped up for this). \n\nThe price may seem steep considering what is currently in but I can assure you it's well worth it. The procedural generation makes things fresh, though they do need to add more possible proc-gen elements or it's going to turn out much like DiRT 4 was. Soundtrack just fits the mood oh-so-well; I loved Ratz Instagib's soundtrack and this, while not being by the same label (Liquicity as opposed to Jazzsticks) feels like a logical progression. Feedback is also merely a few keystrokes and mouse clicks away - join the verified [url=http://discord.gg/descenders]Discord server[/url] and chime in. The developers are very open to feedback - it's in Early Access after all and they sorely NEED it. Anything you feel needs improved? Tell them!\n\nFull disclosure: Part of the reason I got this was because Bike Rose...sorry, Mike Rose...is unequivocally an awesome bloke. While I've heard of RageSquid from Action Henk (but still haven't played that title yet), Descenders was the first title from them that I've really sunk my time into. I've known him since his days at tinyBuild, but only really got to know him better during his short stint at Ripstone. He's genuinely a smart and funny guy; with a lot of experience gained from different publishers with different working styles, getting your game [url=http://nomorerobots.io/]published with him[/url] means that it's in relatively safe hands.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna sink more hours into this. It's all downhill from here.\n\n[h1]When to buy[/h1]\nI've been told this game won't go on discount or bundle for a while. If you want to come help shape the development and contribute feature suggestions, get it now and chime in. You're also welcome to wait until it's out of Early Access as the price won't be increased.\n\nEither way, don't miss out.\n\n[h1][b]EA+++/10[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1518244439, "timestamp_updated": 1519625465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39969653": {"recommendationid": "39969653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081409936", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 18147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1998, "last_played": 1521752288}, "language": "english", "review": "Descenders is a fast paced game at it's core, but it doesnt have to be.\nWhile going fast this game is fun to enjoy but also when you just want to unwind from a day work and go slow.\n\nThere are alot of Positives and a few Negatives which are as followed\n\n---------------------------\nPros:\n---------------------------\n-it looks really good \n-handles really well on controller\n-the flow and progression of the game is top notch\n-you can see yourself getting better\n-the soundtrack, oh god that sweet soundtrack\n-the freedom to go anywhere within the vast maps\n-it has alot of gameplay even for early access\n-quite a few unlocks in it's current state \n-devs are open to feedback\n-nvidia ansel support for some glorious screenshots\n\nwhile playing this game it's best to remind people that it's quite a skillbased game due to it's tailormade physics, which in time you can master expertly\n\nalthough i recommend this game i will add that it's not a simulation nor an arcadey game. it's a mix between them.\n\n---------------------------\nCons\n---------------------------\n-going too fast isn't always the best option (really minor inconvinience)\n-some angled jumps can throw you off (minor inconvinience)\n-keyboard controls isn't recommended altough not bad (minor inconvinience)\n-the learning curve can be steep \n-framrate below 60 fps may cause input slight input lag\n---------------------------\nA multiplayer mode aswell as a replay feature is being looked into by the devs and are on the roadmap.\n\nwithin this Early Access periode Descenders will grow as the community does, with the devs awaiting feedback and open to suggestion.\n\n-long story short, it's good and will be better", "timestamp_created": 1518242345, "timestamp_updated": 1518253006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578508", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39969378": {"recommendationid": "39969378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042193835", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 316, "last_played": 1521397362}, "language": "english", "review": "First Review i've written:\n\nSo far, game is really enjoyable.

The game runs okay I guess, it could be much better. I get stuttering and I feel that I shouldn't on an i7 6700k, 1080Ti, and 16GB RAM. The game definitely needs to be optimized better. I haven't gotten very far, and I have no idea how many pieces of gear are in the game, but I hope there is a ton more that I can unlock, I really like the customization.\n\nI am definitely happy I bought this game, and I really hope more gets added to it.

It's not really a race, because the tracks in general do not have a time limit. So you also could decide to just park and camp within the nice landscape. But the fun only really starts, if you still try to go as fast as you can. And this feels really fast on this bike and also authentic, when trees are passing you and you just managed to dodge some rocks because you are not riding on the track. \n\nSo the game gives you quite some freedom in choosing you type of play. \n\nI would love to have some additional features like a possible replay at the end. Also it would be great if there were more constructions to make stunts.

It's follows an arcade trend where if you lose all your retires, you'll have to restart the game. So it's not always about speed. It's more about using everything you have to get from point a to point b in an event. It's pretty tense in that aspect. It's sure to pump your full of adrenaline.\n\nIn terms of gameplay it's pretty simple. (PS4 Controller). R2 TO Accelerate, L2 to brake and slow down, and the right analog stick steers and does fancy advanced moves. \n\nThe game has on one mode where you can complete the events in an area till you get to a new one. There are 4 areas and each area can have up to 10+ events. The final event is a really big boss jump. \n\nThe game is also procedurally generated so you can never be prepared for any given moment which is kind of weird as you want to memorize the levels to get better at them. This is more reaction based. Lastly if you lose all your retires, you'll have to start from the beginning. You can get to other areas by beating the previous area boss jump 3 times which I feel is unnecessary as this just forces you to replay these areas over and over again.\n\nYou can get more retires by finishing bonus objectives in events so it's not that bad.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nPros:\n- great visuals\n- solid frame rate\n- there is quite a bit of customization, with bikes, clothing, sponsors and helmets and such\n- tense and exhilarating gameplay\n- procedurally generated means it's always fresh I guess\n- soundtrack is awesome and fitting for this game\n\nCons:\n- there are occasional fps dips, screen tears, and pop in when going at high speeds.\n- the shortcut stuff is annoying. Why can't we go to the next area when we finish the first area. Seems a bit pedantic and redundant\n- no multiplayer lol. This needs to happen \n- the bonus objectives sometimes can't be completed. For example sometimes you may get a bonus objective that asks you to do 2 backflips, but there is only on one jump opportunity in the event. Yea the procedurally generated stuff can sometimes mis match. Needs tuning\n\nOverall a great experience. I was terrible at the beginning but I got better over time and started to love the adrenaline rush the game gave me. I only got to play 1 hour but I'm clamouring to play more lol\n\nCheers", "timestamp_created": 1518210426, "timestamp_updated": 1518210426, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39961679": {"recommendationid": "39961679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301256978", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 151, "last_played": 1521741855}, "language": "french", "review": "Super jeux ! pour un acc\u00e8es anticip\u00e9 il est top pas de bugs les mondes a \u00e9bloquer sont asser dur je trouve.

Don't be scared of the Early Access listing, this game is very polished for a title that is in Early Access and sets a great example for where a title should be when hitting Early Access. The controls and the bike itself feel incredible, the maps within the 4 zones currently available are randomly generated to constantly give you a new ride every time you play. You can sink in hours at a time or just play a run and feel satisfied.\n\nYou can pick a team to earn specific gear for that team as you level up from successful runs, and also provides you with a team specific area that you can choose to do in a run. Each team is meant to represent a different way of playing the game: Enemy for Tricking and Stunts, Aboreal for trail-less riding/offroading, and Kinetic for fast and curvy trails. \n\nI picked Enemy because I LOVE doing tricks and stunts in this game. Team Enemy tends to bail the most and the hardest, but after we eat enough dirt, we come back hard and fast with crazy moves. There are some new players that feel dissuaded to trick and stunt because of losing XP or Leaderboard positions, but half the fun of being Enemy is getting so familiar with the game and controls where you can pull off these tricks off big tricks on big stunts and land them consistently. Using practice mode will be a big help. You're missing out on some good times if you pass up tricking, don't be scared to eat some dirt, embrace it and master it!\n\nYou lose 1% of your total XP every time you bail during your ride and 5% if you lose all your HP in a run, which basically lowers your rank on the leaderboard and holds you back from leveling up with your team to unlock new cosmetics. There is a practice mode where you can do a run without worrying about losing XP. You can still unlock Cosmetics that aren't tied to your team randomly after finishing runs, doesn't matter if you survive the run or not. You also wont lose Team Cosmetics if you rank down from the rank you unlocked them.\n\nOnce you run down to your last life, you will enter LAST STAND. One more wipe after Last Stand will Rekt you and make you lose 5% of your XP, but you are rewarded with 2X XP for everything you do while in Last Stand.\n\nYou also have health, which you lose from doing bails, and even more from harder bails. Completing the bonus objective for a map will give you health back and more XP. Bails are only punishing if you are concerned with leaderboard rank or cosmetics for your team. Even then, you're going to have to spend some time bailing to practice doing stunts or big moves. You can quickly get your rep back as you get better at the game and feel out the zones.\n\nThere are currently 4 total areas in the game with 3 locked. You can progress to a new zone by beating the boss jump, and can unlock the ability to skip the previous zone once you complete the boss jump of the zone before it 3 times.\n\nThis title is in a great spot, where its easy to pick up and play, but hard to master and do the most incredible of tricks and cleanest of runs without bailing. It encourages you to play how you want, take your time or go crazy. No timers so you don't have to be restricted or stressed out by that, all that matters is enjoying your runs in your own way. The bailing will go away with time and practice.\n\nIn my opinion, the amount of content in this game is practically limitless if you can have fun just getting better at handling yourself and your bike, as well as going to do bigger stunts and actually landing them. Yes there are a lot of other games you can get on at the price point its at, but you're not going to find any other biking game even close to the realm Descenders is in. It just depends on if you get hooked on the mechanical feel of the game itself or not. \n\nI personally love it and the procedural generation provides a constantly changing playground to experiment on. I play the game personally just because it feels so solid mechanically and I love Mountain Biking, its a blast to trick and stunt through these worlds. Leaderboards are fun and can help give you another goal to orient your focus on, but can dissuade people from trying to stunt or trick. I think it makes landing those tricks and stunts in a real run just that much more satisfying, and if you aren't comfortable with a zone yet, you can always hit practice mode.\n\nI highly recommend it for any other biking fans out there. For those not into biking as much, it can have the appeal of how Skate had the appeal to others with making your own fun and challenges, and just getting better at riding. The dev team has always been very friendly and active with us on the Descenders Discord (which I highly recommend joining if you get the game, or stopping by if you have some questions for players or the devs) and I can tell a lot of love has been put into this game already.\n\nThe community that has grown is super friendly, active, and fun to talk with as well. Between the great team behind this game and the wonderful community, I can only imagine what else is in store for Descenders future.

This can result in the player having a hard time getting used to these controls.\n\nPros:\n-Good looking graphics\n-Good arcade-like physics\n-Smooth but sturdy controls\n-No noticable bugs (my experience)\n-Unlock new items for your biker when completing levels\n\nCons:\n-High price when taking in account replayability and early access\n-Not a huge amount of capabilities in terms of content\n-Singleplayer (not a con if you don't mind singleplayer games)\n\nIn conclusion I think that unless you are sure that you will enjoy this game, you should probably follow this games development and judge for yourself whether you want to play it. I like the game but I think they should try to encorporate multiplayer and add some more content as for the current price there are many other games that could be worth your money.\n\nOverall rating - 5.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1518194953, "timestamp_updated": 1518194953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39956836": {"recommendationid": "39956836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246649084", "num_games_owned": 842, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518194490}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u96be\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\u5927\u7684\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u901f\u964d\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5bf9\u64cd\u63a7\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u6bd4\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u624b\u6b8b\u515a\u8868\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5173\u90fd\u5f88\u96be\u8fc7\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1518194594, "timestamp_updated": 1518194594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39956594": {"recommendationid": "39956594", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987733880", "num_games_owned": 513, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520272710}, "language": "english", "review": "The game feels finished as it is.

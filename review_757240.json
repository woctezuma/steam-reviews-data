for me, I won't be disappointed if it is not added.\nReason is because rockets (in Quake) do splash damage and I always get high percentage hits with rockets anyway.\n\nBut I know they are going to be adding things to Aimtastic, so will be fun to see what comes in the future.\n\nFor lightning gun (and nail gun) tracking and rail gun aiming, this Aimtastic game has opened my eyes to things I need to

It's got incredible looking maps, a nice variety of weapons that pack a punch while also being fairly balanced, colorful enemies with different tactics to dissuade a single form of gameplay, and more. If you were a fan of Descent, you'll feel right at home.\n\nIf you never played Descent, be aware of some of its challenges. It's very easy to get lost on the maps, especially as you're trying to make your escape. Some areas have cues to help, but they're a bit inconsistent on that front. Harder difficulty levels mean a LOT of dodging, and the lack of an NPC paradigm of consequence means that if you're not playing multiplayer, you're going to feel a bit lonely.\n\nAll in all, an excellent game that's well worth its cost, and props for the developers for keeping the core tenets of such a great game in what is more than simply a reskin or a nostalgia grab, but a great game in its own right.", "timestamp_created": 1514577116, "timestamp_updated": 1514577116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38710024": {"recommendationid": "38710024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072997539", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 102, "last_played": 1514753889}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't got the brainpower at the moment to write a full review, but I can say without a doubt the game has a solid foundation as far as gameplay is concerned.\n\nIf I had to say what I liked least, I'd have to say the levels. They feel characterless and confined. In descent 3, the levels were big, important chapters of the game, each feeling distinct. Switzers lab, the city, mars, the battleship, the prooving grounds--all of them had their own feel and shape. And they all took a good amount of time to get through too, but whether or not that's a good thing is up to debate.\n\nThe enemies feel less important too. I could barely tell what I was fighting let alone pay the distinction any mind. The most I could tell was that one of them attacked via ramming.\n\nOnce again, to compare to descent 3: The little blue police-looking robots which told you to freeze, The big screeching brutes, the ones with the claws, the soldiers, the flying squid things, the gunslingers. All of these had character. \n\nIn Overload they've been downgraded to making simple noises and all looking relativly the same.\n\nNow, I know reading this you might think I don't like it: I've only been playing for 30 minuets max.

If you're familiar with that series of games you need to know absolutely nothing else, and so if you enjoyed those games, no doubt you'll find the same fun with these, only with updated sounds and graphics (to be quite honest sometimes I kind of expect the sounds to still be all chunky and retro-styled while playing).  If you hated those games, you have something wrong in your life and no, you will not enjoy this game. However, for those seeking enlightenment on the topic, let me tell you what Descent/Overload is. It's a series of games which focus on the idea of the player being a spaceship in a 6 degrees of freedom environment (this is code for \"there is no up or down\" and your ship will turn exactly as you move the mouse) named \"material defender\" (This is only stated in Descent and because the ships looks the same I assume that's the name here too) which has been sent to liberate a string of mining operations from some sort of rogue AI takeover being headed by a big reactor which presumably houses the head of the mess. Actually, scrach that, it's canonically some sort of robo-virus. I forget the exact plot of the Descent series because it was never that strong. In order to fulfill your mission you are provided a few weapons along the way which range from laser to missiles to a psuedo-shotgun to a glorified miniature nuke to etc. Each level follows a standard format: You spawn in, progress along a fairly linear course while taking on robots that make their best attempt to stop you, finally reach the reactor which you must destroy, and escape the base afterwards. There is also an upgrade system, but enough about all of that, let me toss everything into Pro-Con format:\nPros:\n + Weapons are satisfying to use and are all reminiscent of the Descent 2 arsenal (impulse lasers are the standard laser, hunter missiles are the homing missiles, the driller is the guass cannon, etc.). No one weapon is really left out to dry in terms of practicality.\n + Music is an obvious homage to the style of music used for the original Descent games. A good job here.\n + Enemy variety is pretty wild, so don't expect to be bored by one and the same robot each time. \n + Level design is really good except for one level.\n + Controls are pretty smooth and even the \"spaceship sway\" from the original games is emulated (what spaceship sway means is that turning your ship usually doesn't stop it on the spot, rather it kinds of tapers down in speed).\n + Obviously made with care, seeing as the development team from the other Descent games is working on it after seeing how bad Descent: Underground was butchered (Hint: It was butchered so bad you can't even buy it on Steam anymore).\n + A nifty upgrade system which, while not the most useful thing, is a pretty good addition to the game and does no harm.\nCons: \n - I don't know how bad a startup screen can get but this is the worst I've seen. Each time you boot up the game it starts with a black screen until you task manager out and get back into the window again, and even after that it still sometimes stops and freezes or even worse, crashes. \n - The level \"Titan Observatory\" feels like something out of Serious Sam, and while I'm all for those games, this is not the place for a Serious Sam level. Titan Observatory just floods you with tons of brainless enemies, all of which you need to deal with in an usually open area without much in the way of \"creative cover\". Also, it introduced a BS new enemy type which is slow and does nothing but hurl an endless stream of rockets at you non-stop. Also, any level is too long if you hear the music track loop more than 10 times in one playthrough. This is a level that needs a serious rework. \n - The BS enemy previously described.\n\nTotal: 9 / 10\nThis is what a faithful continuation of a series looks like.

Everything about this game feels promising, from a gameplay and even development standpoint, but in it's current state it is a glorified, albiet very polished demo of sorts.\n\nEverything from the music, to the graphics, to the ship handling, to ther weapons feels phenominal. \n\nWeapons have a certain \"weight\" to them and varies depending on which one you're using. They all feel like they have thier place and are balanced well against the enemy types.\n\nThe music is this mid 90's \"Goldeneye-esque\" sound that meshes well with the games atmosphere, especially considering it's a love letter to that era and the height of 6DOF games. \n\nThe graphics are great, and are exactly what they need to be. Sort of inbetween old and new. Blocky enough to harken back to the old style, but with enough polish and pop to fit in with newer titles. Like the ships themselves look very much like that chunky classic design, but the lighting effects of the weapons and levels really stand out and look great,\n\nControl-wise, even as a flightstick/gamepad player everything is responsive and smooth. All buttons and axes can be bound and rebound to whatever your heart desires. Your ship feels great to control and manouvering around obsticals and enemies is effortless once you get the hang of it, which isn't long. The control scheme and handling make it easy, especially if your used to flight/space sims or even FPS games.\n\nGameplay feels great, making use of the stay moving or die philosphy of old shooters. A lot of the challange comes from keeping tabs on your surroundings, your weapons, your energy and your enemies at the same time. Balancing booming and zooming, full on assaults, or retreating to replenish health/energy/weapons. All in all, the core of it is very satisfying to get a hang of and clearing out a horde of enemy ships all trained on you is very satisfying.\n\nAgain, as this is an early access \"beta\", there's not a lot in the way of game modes, and while maps and game types are still being added, what you have are some broken up story maps and survival modes.

I'm not, and never was, a \"Triple-D\" (Devout-Descent-Disciple) - I admired the concept, but simply didn't fall in love with 6DOF back in the 90's. \n\nThere are enough reviews from \"Triple-D's\" here on Steam as well as the Overload forums, that virtually everything positive about Overload has already been said - so what can I add as an apparent \"pagan\"?\n\nFor those gamers that perhaps have either never indulged in a 6DOF affair, or have dipped their toes in, but found the temprature somewhat uncomfortable, Overload is a breath of fresh air - because it works flawlessly and is absolutely accessible in a very minimalistic way ! When it comes to gaming that involves wreaking explosive havoc on any form of enemy by means of an impressive incendiary arsenal, there are some critical factors that must be in place to hook me and keep me coming back for more: minimal time spent in config/setup menus, pitch-perfect and responsive controls, ambience and immersion (art-style, sound, lighting), simple and compelling gameplay. I was having fun with Overload within 10 minutes in much the same way that ID games captivated me back in the 90's - all of the ingredients were there!\n\nChallenge mode alone is currently worth the price of admission, although the MP component (available in 2018?) will hopefully provide a few game modes similar to UT3 (i.e. bot matches) thereby providing eons of fun for years to come. \n\nAgain, for anyone relatively new to this genre, but with a love of FPS's, this won't disappoint, especially given the support  for various control devices ! You certainly don't need to be a \"Triple-D\" or a flight-sim genius to enjoy this high octane, easily accessible, addictive arcade shooter and at this point, it's hard to pinpoint any significant negative aspects of the game. \n\nUPDATE 08 SEP: \nThere have been a few build releases in the interim adding new weapons (timebomb), new CM maps (Blizzard - probably one of the best thus far) and overall game balance adjustments (some good, some not so good) . Overall, still highly recommended, although it's likely that a truly well balanced and well honed CM mode won't be seen until much further along in the dev cycle.\n\nUPDATE 15 DEC: \nAn additional CM map has now been added (Backfire), leadeboard scores have been completely reset, and further balance adjustments have been made. Balance however still appears to be an issue in Challenge Mode, particularly with a select few of the bot enemies (Reavers) as well as the RNG, which can at times be quite frustrating in \"grinding\" for that perfect run.

They built a demo, put it on a CD in a pc gaming magazine and BAM.  The following for Descent begins.   Another developer creates a program called Kali, which tricks Descent into thinking people are playing on a LAN network, only over their 14-28k Modems and madness of the best kind ensues. \n\nOnline gaming finds its fame.. followed by gaming icons such as the Quake series which only strived to make this hobby more popular. \n\nThese developers are now called Revival.. and while they may have had to change the name and introduce some new weapons (or weapon names).. they're conceiving and giving birth to the modern iteration that won so many PC gamers over and kept MS Sidewinder 3d Pro's being sold until eventually every retailer was out of stock. \n\nThe game is a 6DoF shooter, and is more like the original 6DoF shooter gamers of the 90's know than anything I've ever played.  It's still just as fun.   Focus on your screen.. ignore the room around you or you might get a little dizzy.   Up the difficulty in singleplayer and find yourself hiding behind corners not wanting to charge into the death ahead that awaits you.  3 of the 15+ mission single player campaign are all available to play around in the Early Access version, and there are many challenge maps to go and hone your skills on or drive yourself mad trying.\n\nThose of you who were fans of the Descent series, and we all know I mean Descent 1 and 2, this is the game you've been waiting for.    For those of you who have no clue what Descent is? Please, take a step inside and have your mind blown. You're in a \"spaceship\", flying around in \"mineshafts\" with secrets and enemies.  You can move forward, backwards, up, down, left, right, diagonal.  You can fly in three directions at once and get increased speed.  You have a \"boost\" which you might be more familiar with the idea of an Afterburner.   And you have lasers.. and flak cannons, or a big shotgun, or a long range driller.. or so many more awesome little weapons to play around with.  There are robots.  They want to kill you and your job is to kill them, blow up a reactor and get the heck out of dodge, maybe rescue some hostages along the way. \n\nAt high difficulties, they WILL kill you.  \n\nBy the way - WE ARE GETTING A MISSION EDITOR!!@#$%!#% :) And Multiplayer will be in the works as soon as they finish the single player component. \n\nSo, let me move on to some of the aspects that will make this game as great as I know it will be.\n\nFor one - the developers are oldskool.  These people helped shape the online gaming world which back then was limited to the personal computer.  It seems like they still care about their PC users, as they have made sure to support the numerous gaming peripherals available to us.  Joystick support is great, and while sensitivity and deadzones are based on presets - there are enough of them that if you prefer playing with a game pad, cheap joystick + keybaord, or full hotas setup with rudder pedals you will find a setting you enjoy playing with.  IF you get enough immersion from your mouse and keyboard? You will do fine in this game.  It seems like the high scorers in challenge modes are M+KB users and I'm fine with that.  MP will be another story. \n\nThere is VR support if you own VR, and just last night they released an update that includes TrackIR support which they acted QUICKLY on implementing when it was suggested to them in the forums.   Lovely little thing, and though this starts out sounding negative, it is completely a positive -\nThey listed \"TrackIR support\" in an update released last night and it had been disabled accidentally.  Only an hour ago, the NEXT DAY, they released an update that fixed not only that but a couple of other issues that had been reported, AND they were kind enough to update the steam forums to let us know it'd been released and fixed.  TrackIR support fully functional - and the devs are personally communicating with their exisiting and future playerbase. \n\nI'm not sure I've ever been more excited at the prospect of a video game.  These devs care about their product and it shows, not only with an Early Access release that is very playable and gaining new content, features, and improvements regularly, but has a team of devs that is open to the discussion of upcoming features and the concerns of their playerbase and involve themselves personally in reading and replying to those concerns.   Take a look at the steam forums for this game.  It honestly seems like the devs enjoy the feedback and want to give us the best experience we can possibly have with their creation.  I'd go as far to say they care about the PC playerbase as much as any version of the game they're going to release.. and the price for the product is MORE than fair for the amount of content we are going to get.  I feel guilty having only learned about Overload during a steam sale.. I would have paid more than the full price.  The devs were upfront and honest with a recent post explaining that they're moving the release date back and the response to it has been purely positive despite the fact that the people already playing this are dying to see the full product and I believe that's because we know these devs will make it worth our while with a polished product. The fact that they are communicating with us during development personally and openly considering and even implementing our suggestions says so much about them and the quality of the product we're going to get. \n\n\nI'm usually pretty critical of modern developers but the Revival team has done nothing but impress me since I stumbled across this gem of a title.  \n\nIf we are still alive.. let's show the world that PC gaming isn't dead and that gaming on the PC platform has to meet certain standards that differ from the needs of the console gaming community.  This development team is well on its way to providing an excellant example of those standards. \n\nBuy it..fly it, enjoy the joy.  I'll see you when multiplayer is released next year. :)", "timestamp_created": 1498337350, "timestamp_updated": 1501873398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32738762": {"recommendationid": "32738762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005778962", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509417627}, "language": "english", "review": "I only needed to play this game for about 15 minutes before my muscle memory was back from 1995.

You can tell they've tapped into modern computing power which enabled some more advanced mechanics and visuals.  THIS is how video games were meant to be played.  Nobody to this day has made a combat game like Descent EXCEPT for this team, and this title perfectly brings back the complete smooth 3-dimensional control combat mechanics.\n\nThe biggest CON for this title at the moment is the utter lack of multiplayer PVP (local LAN support especially important for those 90's Descent fanboys out there).  I read that they are promising a multiplayer expansion in 2018.  I can't wait.

For me it was one of those games I fondly remembered as one of the best ever. A game that I thought had always been vastly under rated and I would rave about it to anyone I could over the years. Descent was so damn fun and multiplayer was amazing. Hiding upside down on the roof of a a tunnle waiting for your victum to fly underneath you then drop down like a gd spider king. Awesome! When steam released 1,2, and 3 I was overjoyed. When Descent Underground was announced I was again overjoyed and had high hopes. Well since it's beta release I've been disappointed. Not that it's a bad game, but it just didn't feel like the descent I remembered. In fact lots of other companies have tried to recreate 6dof but none have felt \"right\".\n\nUntil now. Overload from the orginial creators of Descent absolutely feels \"right\". It's actually superb, perfect, excelent, amazing, and awesome. It is the perfect game all over again. It's not just a remake with updated graphics, I mean it is that but they've really topped themselves here. It's just like original Descent but fresh and new. I think it feels a bit darker in tone than the orginial. Just a bit though not too much. A little more hard scifi serious but still very much Descent like. The robots are 10x better with 10x better A.I. Each bot is different with different movement and attacks. The level design is 10x better, they're bigger, badder, and prettier with more floors and more twists and turns, and more secrets. The graphics are also 10x better with more partical effects and cooler lighting. I was really impressed with how well the caverns were done. They're pitch black. You have to use your flares to navigate and when you light them up they're beautiful. The flares shoot ahead of you for a bit then slowly die out prompting you to launch another. Meanwhile enemy bots are hunting you. You get a jump scare when they pop up behind you, above you, below you, etc. Omg what a start. If this is just the tip of the iceburg we are in for one hell of a game here.\n\nThis is the game I've wished and hoped for for the last 20 years. All I can say to the developers is thank you, thank you, thank you so much. I can't wait for the full release.

Overload gets the old Descent feeling way better. That's for several reasons:\n\nOverload's gameplay is way more fun. The action takes place mostly in close combat, where navigation is key without the game being too hectic. Your weapons have this Ooomph that just feels right. Also the weapons have a good variety (I love the Creeper mines and the Driller cannon!). Enemy's have good recognizable silhouettes and an already pretty good variety. Although the levels are small in this Early Access version, they are well structured and despite one section in the demo level that's labyrinth-like have a clear layout where it's hard to lose track.\n\nThe graphics are great. Yeah, they are more simple than in other games, but that's for the better in this kind of genre. When your action is fast paced and your orientation is difficult because of the six degrees of freedom, it is best to keep the visuals simple to not overexert the eyes (as Descent Underground does). It has style and atmosphere and serves the gameplay - and for me that's far more important than fancy shaders and trillions of polygons on screen.\n\nMy only cons thus far:\n- I encountered several crashes\n- there is only one single player level\n- there are only four challenge levels\n- there is no multiplayer\n\nSo only buy this, if you want to support the devs, not if you want to have a complete game to play.

Design, direction, artwork, effects, music, and of course the weapons. It's like they took every sick af part of the best mid-90s scifi games with unconventional designs and jammed them all into a complete package but re-tooling them to be very effective and even somewhat believable.\n\nThe music? A fantastic and fitting blend of techno, electrorchestra, some tech house/trance(???) flavors, and of course that industrial techno jam. The track for the Syrinx challenge level even uses the signature, calling-card compressed drums, the legendary pads, and even some other techno samples, from all kinds of popular industrial music. Not like DooM'16 industrial, but that oldschool techno-industrial stuff.\n\nThe lighting engine is used very well, with properly decorated levels, PBR that doesn't look like that generic metallic garbage (polished stone tile looks like polished stone tile), and it appears to be fairly optimized, even with a ton of flares lying around (bright innit?). The weapon effects also leave little to nothing wanting. Each weapon looks like it was hand-crafted before even being made public, now some of the more advanced additional effects for upgrades might not appear until later, but even some of the basic ones appear, like for upgrades to the Impulse and Flak. The weapon model, the muzzle flash, the projectile, the heat trail of the Driller and the Flak's heat wave from saturating the area in front of you with pyrotechnics, and the impact effects. Either particles or a mesh, but they're definitely not sprites. Robot weapons included.\n\nRobot parts looking damaged and then flying off (purely decorative) is made clear to add to the visceral nature of action games of this sort, and their death rolls complete with flame, smoke, and eventual collapse are no exception. Their loot not being exposed until they actually explode, leaving fiery particle trails and shrapnel everywhere (you can speed this up by shooting their failing chassis).\n\nOn top of that there are tons of little details on the HUD even though it's minimalist. It's still quite utilitarian and provides important info at a glance, and a really useful reticle that includes a minimal display of ammo and shields, with unique patterns for each primary (none for the secondaries yet, besides the heavies which have a orange outline). The Cyclone spreadgun even has a secondary reticle that shows you it's next firing arcs.\n\nRobot AI is intelligent and savage. Each machine having it's own behavior and temperment, increasing in agression as you piss them off with a baseline of whatever difficulty you pick. They'll even push you into a corner room if they can. I've put a lot of hours into Descent 2 who's AI design still holds up to this day, and I can tell you with certainty that the AI in this game is even more nasty.\n\nAs for you, you get a lot of choices, even in the first release there are more matterguns and a wider variety of weapon designs than one would normally expect, and there are improved versions of some the old greats. Plenty of different secondaries to toy with as well. The dumbfires are fast and brutal; homings are slow but agile. You've even got pod rockets. Homing pod rockets. The upgades give you even more choices and make some weapons take a step back to take two steps forward, like the Driller firing smaller projectiles but faster for more DPS and less punishing misses, or how you can slap a small guidance system onto the Falcon dumbfires.\n\nOh, and you can shoot through grates. Just thought I should mention that.\n\nOverall this game is shaping up very quickly, with a constant flow of bugfixes and optimizations, and steady work on the major elements. It's only been in-dev for three years and they've already got a lot of the important stuff done or at least in a position to be completed without any nasty roadblocks, and they're not even close to done. Their dedication is very clear and present, making it absolutely worth the asking price of 25$.\n\n\nFinally I want to make something clear. This game is not \"oh hey check out all these 6dof games coming out, wanna revisit the good old days?\" They planed this as early as 2014, before they had even heard of D:U (i'm only 75% certain of this particular fact), and before SL0 was anything more than a Ludum Dare. They literally got to talking about a new game and were like \"wanna make another 6DOF game?\" ... \"HELL YEAH\" and so they got most of the Old Guard back together and some new chaps as well.

It's simply incredile. Smooth controls, lots of input options, well polished UI's for VR, an immersive feel, good enemy AI (much more mature that two other current 6dof shooters I've tried; those being Sublevel Zero and Descent Underground) and a far more \"complete\" feel to the single player experience.\n\nI'm hoping this project continues, because I do look forward to playing a long, grueling solo campaign through as many levels as you can toss at me. Titan enemies (bosses) in large arenas could also be a plus to the current level-end \"destroy the core\" type mechanic. \n\nSo far, excellent. I truly hope this project comes to completion, because the core elements are there, and they work better than any other games in this category.\n\nHere's a first impressions video I made using the HTC VIVE:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJeIXHCy5CE\n\nI plan on trying it in the Rift sometime soon as well.", "timestamp_created": 1489782700, "timestamp_updated": 1489783384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553431", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30568833": {"recommendationid": "30568833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050001437", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489756953}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, but too expensive for a pretty simple game..", "timestamp_created": 1489757644, "timestamp_updated": 1489757644, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.181428", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30546432": {"recommendationid": "30546432", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999231543", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 68, "last_played": 1514810330}, "language": "english", "review": "An outstanding 6-DOF festival, even in early access. As it stands, it is an excellent successor of Descent.\n\nThe game plays just like the original: Navigate 3D environments in a space ship, collect items and weapons to progress, blast robots to bits, and then blast the reactor to bits... oh, and escape, or you'll also be blown to bits.\n\nThe individual robots are very smart, especially in the challenge mode. They'll go and cut you off while you are running through a tight corridor, hunt you in packs, approach you from behind and grab you... The fights are really tense, especially on higher difficulties.\n\nThe graphics and the overall design is a win as well. The environments are detailed enough to be attractive, but simple enough to be navigated. The levels look distinct from each other, but a little bit of \"same\" feeling *may* be there, perhaps after a quite while of play time. I connect this issue to the state of the game right now, as there are not much levels yet... and these levels are very well played, I never felt bored in repeated playthroughs. In fact, their pace is so frantic, especially on higher difficulty challenge levels, that one doesn't think about graphics that much.\n\nThe individual robots can be recognized at a glance, and the damage system is ok (maybe you can dismember the bots, without destroying them? Imagine a bot, which has one arm destroyed and is also on fire, doing a kamikaze...). They feel quite different from each other: the little pesky ones, the big bad rocket platforms, the maniacal Shredder with its charge attack and distinct scream (which will be in my nightmares, along with a certain bot from the first Descent. You know which &%+ Wheeezer I'm talking about.). Excellent work.\n\nThe weapons are designed well so far, and they are very fun to use. They have distinct strengths and weaknesses, making them situational weapons: There is the starting laser, dealing low/moderate damage with moderate firing rate, a few shotgun-like guns using matter or energy for close quarters, a charging weapon that deals high damage with low refire, dumbfire missiles, homing missiles, missile pods that fire tons of missiles very rapidly, mines that are excellent for shooting around that corner, and that big one going with an extra-large kaboom. And there is yet to come (I'm sure they will be great and tested well, without being TOO annoying, right? RIGHT?? I'm looking at YOU, designer of those !&% HOMING FLASH MISSILES!!! My EYES man, HAVE MERCY! - Good programming, by the way). You can try each of them in challenge mode, where you are dealt with different weapons each time you start a new game...\n\nSpeaking of weapons, you can also \"Bump\" into the robots, like a melee attack. You can finish off weakly arnored bots like this. You can also use this to gain an additional boost as you are boosting. One thing, however, this bumping \"locks\" into the nearby enemies, which isn't good if you are trying to dodge them - you get smashed right into them instead, sometimes with additional bots surrounding you. I'd like an option at the very least, to turn this locking feature off, we can smash our way without it.\n\nOne thing I noticed that the environment doesn't get damaged...  Granted, we're in early access, so this aspect might be added later. Still, I looked for destroyable screens everywhere...\n\nThe interface is great, you can tell your ship's status at a glance. Only a minor alteration I'd suggest, maybe a bit larger fonts, especially for the central armor counter near the reticle... It is somewhat hard to read :)\n\nEDIT, 20.03.2017: Re-reading this, I realize I forgot a major part out: The sound and the music, and both are over the top. The sound design is fantastic: the weapons sound deadly, and the robots sound even deadlier. The only nuisance was the automap on/off effect, it sounded a little too close to an actual robot hunting you...\n\nBut the most shining thing in this game is the music, with the one in the 4th challenge map (Centrifuge) being my favorite. In fact, I played that challenge map over and over, just to keep listening it :).\n\nOverall, the minds behind the game are putting up an excellent job. It is expected, since it is a team of veterans, the creators of the original game(s), as well as great mission sets for those games. I'm confident that they will keep up the good work, and I cannot wait for the rest of this game's development... especially THAT level editor!\n\nI recommend this game with confidence in this team.

Als Descent Fan der ersten Stunde - ja ich bin so alt ;) -  muss ich sagen: sehr, sehr geil!\n\nDie Stimmung kommt sofort wieder auf, enge G\u00e4nge, verwinkelte Maps und Horden von Gegnern. \n\nGrafik: gef\u00e4llt! L\u00e4uft maximiert sehr fl\u00fcssig in WQHD unabh\u00e4ngig von Gegnerhorden und Strahlengewitter (i7 3770K @ 4,3 GHz, GTX 1070). Die Optik gef\u00e4llt und passt zum Setting.  Licht- und Partikeleffekte passen auch.\n\nSteuerung:\nmit Maus und Tastatur ist recht pr\u00e4zise mit dem Abstrich, dass das Wechseln der Ausrichtung und das Wechseln der Bewaffnung/Raketen nat\u00fcrlich nicht ganz so intuitiv ist. Aber das Ausrichten der eigenen Position und Optik ist definitiv einfacher als in den alten Teilen.\nMit XBOX 360 Controller funktioniert das Spiel fabelhaft. Die Steuerung ist absolut intuitiv! Links- und Rechtsrolle, Steigen und Sinken, Weapon Slot und Raketen durchschalten bzw. beides einsetzen. Super!\n\nMir gef\u00e4llt sehr gut, dass wenn man ann\u00e4hernd parallel zum Untergrund ist, sich das Schiff selbst ausrichtet, das macht den Verwirr-Faktor wesentlich geringer und erleichtert die Navigation durch die Level\n\nSoundeffekte und Musik: Sounds passen, Musik war auch da :D Die Hintergrundbeschallung ist mir im Kampf-Stress weder positiv noch negativ aufgefallen unn das reicht. :)\n\nSpielmodi: \nKampagne: Das erste der Level der Kampagne ist noch \u00fcberschaubar von der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe, anfangs \u00fcbersichtlich und dann ziemlich verwinkelt.

Mir gef\u00e4llts, eignet sich auch gut um den Kampf gegen \u00dcberzahl zu trainieren und verschiedene Waffen zu testen.\n\nZuerst hatte ich die freie Demo angespielt, da schwante mir schon \u00dcbles. Diese Early Access Version hat bereits alle meine Zweifel weggewischt! F\u00fcr Fans der Descentserie oder schneller, verwirrender Shooter absolut empfehlenswert!

Made by the original creators of the Descent games of the 90's, you get exactly what you would expect from these stalwart developers. Well designed, tight, beautiful environments. Engaging and robust AI. Interesting and varied enemy types with a spectacular design that is both classic and modern. Great audio and sound design, and stunning new graphics that ensnare and captivate the auditory and visual senses. All that and their classic, pristine Six Degrees-of-Freedom movement system that made their previous games some of the best games of the 90's. Combat is as challenging as ever with more enemy types than the playable teaser and demos. Giving you an invigorating experience as you attempt to fly through superbly designed, tightly packed caverns and beautifully simplistic star base styled rooms. All while trying to dominate a wide variety intense robotic enemies that have a very challenging and sinister AI at higher levels of difficulty.\n\nThe UI is smooth and clean. Power-ups and weapons have simple yet nicely designed meshes and textures, that fit the world space and overall game design very well. The controls are fantastic and fit in with all their previous classics; They are quick and easy to learn and will have you flying through the \"Labyrinth\" of level design with precision in no time.\n\nThe only problem that I even have with the game is that it did not get its full release this month. However that being said I am truly grateful they decided to release it as an early access game for the time being, giving everyone a chance to experience the wonderment this game has to offer. Plus I would much rather have a game months from now that is complete and well thought out than get a game that released too early with game breaking day one bugs and the feeling of incompleteness that plagues so many of the modern games released currently.\n\nThis game will not immediately seem engaging to everyone. It is not an open world game like so many of the other games of the modern  day. It won't have huge numbers of side quests(which is good in my opinion as so many modern side quests are useless fetch quests.) It is a classic arena styled game with simple objectives. In comparison to all other contenders of 6 DOF this one in my opinion shines out among the many for its precise controls, engaging game play, and well thought out design. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good arena flight game as it definitely rings out among the rest. Give it a try and stick with it for an hour to get comfortable with the controls and I guarantee you will be having a blast for hours to come.\n\nPros:\n\u2022\tSmooth Classic Controls\n\u2022\tEngaging Compact Level Design\n\u2022\tSuperb AI\n\u2022\tGreat Sound Design and Visuals\n\u2022\tMenacing Robot Design\n\u2022\tThe Classic 6 DOF Shooter\n\u2022\tI Was Given Early Access Free as a Backer(Subjective as it only applies to me)\n\nCons:\n\u2022\tIt isn't a full release\n\u2022\tSplash Damage feels like it needs an increase for some weapons and with some enemy types\n\u2022\tDamage from some enemies feels like it needs more balancing on higher difficulties\n\u2022\tSome super robots feel far less menacing than the heavily armored robots, ie they don't feel quite as super as I expected\n\nI will continue to update this review as the game progresses through early access, on it's full release and have a final update with the release of multiplayer. Hope you enjoy the game as much as I do and thanks for reading my review!\n\nEDIT: I was going to continue to update this review but I have pretty summed it up here. The only thing I can say is it continues to get better with every update. The Challenge Mode continues to get new invigorating levels and the bots feel far more balanced than in the early release and updates. The story missions released are engaging and fun, with the classic style of Descent gameplay taken to a whole new level of visual prowess. This definitely is a \"Revival\" of Descent that's been \"Overload\"ed with tighter controls, more challenge, better graphical fidelity, and the best small team Indie Developement can hope for powering it to the new generation.

Overload taps into the best of each Descent title, and the team more than manages to create a new experience (the rights to the Descent name and content are, shall we say - messy) that is fully their own (notwithstanding their publishing deal with EA).\n\nGames such as the new DOOM combine conteporary trimmings with oft-overlooked aspects that made games of yesteryear historical gems. Overload does this in spades in honoring Descent, with fast-paced gameplay, winding levels, and a plethora of weapons and enemies that are uniquely distinct and NOT generic. Wyverns are elusive critters, while bladed 'Shredders' charge at you with alarming regularity. Most bots go down easily, though in Challenge mode you'll encounter rarer 'Super' versions of these robots - an RPG convention that fits in well with Overload's action to keep you on your toes. Well, your WINGS - you're flying after all!\n\nThe levels are beautifully crafted, and even the few environments we've seen thus far feature much in the way of variety, while tying the game together as a whole thematically. I can't wait to see what other locales we'll visit - acid, ice, and even overgrown batthegrounds are all ripe for possibility. In traiditonal single-player sense, you're required to find a reactor, destory and thus 'overload' it and the mine, and escape with your life out of the exit. A tried and true callback to the original Descent games that never gets old since each reactor encounter has different, alternate and increasingly tough challenges and puzzles per map to ensure things remain changed up.\n\nIf you're a fan of FPS, flight sims, and even RPG's, you'll wanna check out Overload.

Right now there is training, a demo level, and a few challenges. If you buy now challenges is what you will be spending most of your time doing. \n\nFor the challenges there are 2 modes, countdown and infinite. They are fairly similar, the one big difference being you die at the end of 5 minutes on countdown if you haven't blown up yet. There are 4 maps, each have some slightly different enemy sets I think. The maps are just about the right size- not so big that you will get lost, but large enough you feel like you have somewhere you can run too. There are also 4 difficulty levels and an additional level (Insane) that can be unlocked. Each of the challenge modes gets more difficult as time goes on - so with time even the lowest difficulty rookie mode becomes tough. You will see your score up on the global leader boards at the end of the challenge, as well as a summary of the enemies you killed, etc.\n\nWhile there isn't many levels to play everything else feels like a finished game rather than something in early access. The levels, enemies, and attacks all look and sound great. It could use some changes to the default XBOX controller layout (the fire gun and missile buttons are right bumper and right trigger so you can only fire one at a time), but you can change them to your liking. You will most likely have to change the sensitivity of your mouse, but the mouse and keyboard default setup feels natural otherwise.\n\nOverall the game doesn't have a ton of content at the moment, but it has the polish of a finished game. Releasing the challenge mode first though was a excellent idea, since they have great replayability for a small amount of content.

There's a full single player campaign coming, but there's only a single example level available right now. The rest is single-player challenge mode: four maps against waves of bots, with leaderboards. It's all enormous fun and feels \"complete\", but it's only a taste of the final game. There's even a free Playable Teaser available which contains quite a bit of this initial Early Access release, so if you're on the fence perhaps try that first, but the devs are working on this now with content drops planned each month, so the difference will soon become highly apparent.\n\nBuying Early Access can be risky. Will they deliver? Well, these are veteran devs with decades of industry experience (and the brains behind some of my favourite games). They clearly know how to manage a project, and so far they're on track albeit slightly behind the original schedule. I have complete faith.

In any event, Overload is shaping up to be a fantastic spiritual successor to the Descent series.

They've also introduced a new physical smash attack, and there's no more badass feeling than smashing a superbot to scrap metal. There are five difficulty levels, with separate leaderboards for each, and the most difficult must be unlocked for each map; this challenge is sure to keep you coming back if you're the competitive type.\n\nIt's worth highlighting the variety of even just the four maps and weapons -- one map is bright with relatively open spaces, another is arranged in a geometric pattern of tunnels and medium-sized rooms, and the other two are full of dark, foreboding tunnels. Because of the different spaces and lighting, each map encourages the use of different weapons and tactics -- the Reflex Cannon probably won't be your first choice on open Syrinx, but it bounces around in deadly fashion in the narrow tunnels of Labyrinth and Caverns.\n\nThe development team is also using dynamic lighting throughout each map. This choice gives the darker maps an exquisitely creepy atmosphere, as you can see the bots' headlights growing more intense on the wall around a corner as they draw near.\n\nThe bots themselves are diverse and interactive. They have a variety of behaviors, from swarming and chasing to running to (as far as I can tell!) predicting your escape and trying to cut you off. They're extremely satisfying to hit and blow up, as they get knocked back, lose pieces of debris, and exhibit a variety of explosions.

It hearkens back to the original Doom/Quake model (and Descent model) where you need keys to open doors to progress to the next area of the level, with occasional boss mobs or hard-to-find treasures mixed in.  Where the real challenge comes in is in the controls and the lack of gravity or an up/down.  At this stage, the videos included with the game can portray it a lot better than I can.

Overload, in everything but the name, is a Descent game made by the original developers to be a modern interpretation of the Descent franchise. Everything that made the original games great is here, and in a time where stagnation is prevalent, the laser focused design of this game makes for a very refreshing experience. \n\nMost surprisingly, to me, is that after all these years of playing a Descent game with a joystick I never thought I would be say this but here it is: \n\nThis title has such good mouse control that you don't need to bother with anything else. \n\nThis is a stellar achievement by the development team. The joystick was one the reasons the originals didn't become quite as ubiquitous as the likes of Doom/Quake.

Thats all I needed. Actually going through the training level is all I needed. This game is EXACTLY what I wanted in a Descent game. Such a simple formula, which I've never seen perfectly replicated by any other publisher. After nearly 20 years of waiting.......... all I can say is it felt like I went straight back in time to 1996. Descent 2 was one of the first PC games I ever played, I loved it then and still love it now. I hoped that Descent Underground would be able to bring back that feeling of nostalgia but they have failed. When I saw that the original creators were involed in this.....what seems as a spiritual successor to the Descent series, well all I can say is that I've been sitting in front of my PC waiting for this to unlock early access. I don't regret waiting. First time ever I haven't regretted paying for early access to a game, even though it is just one demo level. You can tell straight away that this game has the original creators fingerprints all over it. \n\nPros:\nThe fluidity of movement (if you're Descent fanboy like me you muscle memory will kick in split seconds), \nthe electronic soundtrack (which you think wouldn't be an influence but for me its a big deal), \ngameplay itself hasn't change from the originals which makes it so good. \nVisuals are pristine, \nAI, holy sh*t! first time I actually felt like I was being hunted.

The bots are menacing looking and sounding, are ruthless, their AI a true modern evolution for the 6DOF genre. The weapons are varied and gives a nice feedback for use. You'll see some old favorites with a modern edge and some all new concepts. The lighting is excellent and the music is phenominal. If you've played the free playable teaser for Overload before, then consider that just a \"sample\" of what's in this.

The completed game will have a full single player campaign by the writer of Freespace 2, and a multiplayer expansion will be coming about 6-8 months after that. The game already has a sample mission, as well as Challenge Mode, a veritable gauntlet of merciless bots coming after you wave after wave. Do you have what it takes to survive?

You may make your own mind up as to whether or not that's a recommendation.\n\nTo go into more detail:\n\nWere you born in the late 80s or early 90s? Did play flight-sim/shoot-'em-up hybrids like Hellbender and Descent religiously? Do you enjoy the thought of guiltlessly murdering a variety of hovering robots with a colourful selection of guns and missiles? Do you like flying around in extremely constrained spaces?\n\nCongratulations - you will love this game!\n\nWhen I write reviews on Steam, I try to shy away from the whole \"if you liked X, then you'll love this game\" clich\u00e9, but in this case I think it's appropriate. If you liked Descent or any of its direct sequels, you will very likely love this game, because it's literally just Descent but with better graphics. All the guns and missiles are more or less straight ports of weapons from the old games with new names. The robots are different to some degree, but even there I could see some obvious design similarities. Everything is more or less the same.\n\nThis also includes the claustrophobic, labyrinthine level design, the dozens of genuinely secret secret areas in each level, the fast-paced, nerve-racking gameplay and a pretty period-accurate soundtrack. The controls need a little bit of work here and there, but they're generally as tight and responsive as I remember then being back when I was 9 and only very slightly worse at video games than I am at 29.\n\nBeyond a fairly simple upgrade system, this game makes no real attempt to innovate on the Descent formula. The slight changes it makes to core systems from the old games feel like additions that should always have been there. And for fans of Descent 3, I should say that aside from the general look and feel of the game, this game cribs far more heavily from Descent 1 and Descent 2 than the third installment. You shouldn't expect any wide-open outdoor spaces, mission control updates or gigantic set-piece boss fights in this game.\n\nI had genuine fun playing the four missions currently available for this game, and it's one of the few Early Access titles I felt was genuinely worth my money. I can't say for sure whether you'll feel the same. This game is decidedly a nostalgia trip, and if you were never a fan of Descent or you want something that takes the genre some place new, this game will not satisfy you.\n\nBut I loved it.", "timestamp_created": 1516382283, "timestamp_updated": 1516382283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}}}

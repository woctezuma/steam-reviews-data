I'm quite the big fan of visual novels and this one has instantly jumped to the top of my reconmendations and favorites list.  The writing is so charming and funny (and relatable), the art work is very unique and beautiful, the story is very solid and endearing, and every character route is fun, warm, and actually has a conflict that helps Avery grow closer to their love interest.  I have played so many games where conflicts were ignored or skipped over without meaningful resolutions, but Hustle Cat nails them perfectly and it helps make the game so much more lovable and engaging, at the end I cared about every character, even the one that didn't grab me at first.  As much as I wish there was more to see with these characters, I actually like the fact it's fairly short for a VN -- it is very short and sweet and I know I can go replay any route I want to whenever I want to without making a massive time commitment.  Two other amazing things: the sountrack and Avery.  The soundtrack is really, really good and I've been listening to it for months now (I'm listening to it right now).  Avery is mildly customizable in appearance and a choice of She, He, or They pronouns and this was just amazing to me; I didn't really think much of it at first besides it being cool, but at the end of my first route when Avery was refered to as \"They,\" I almost cried.

The strongest point of this game is it's quirky cast. Avery themselves alone is an enjoyable character to watch fumble around. The various love interests will surprise you, and unlike most VNs, I don't think I actually found that I disliked a single route. I had favourites, naturally, but no route I disliked.\n\nGoing points for the game:\n-You can play as male, female, or nonbinary. Your pronouns don't even have to match with your avatar!\n-Be as gay or as straight as you want.\n-Incredibly likeable characters.\n-Great Soundtrack.\n-CAT CAFE.\n\nPoints that you may or may not like:\n-Main character is not renamable.\n-Routes don't have bad endings. Instead, you'll only achieve a \"bad ending\" if you delibertly make a choice that hurtles you towards the bad ending. It's usually fairly obvious, and if even if you get this ending by accident, you'll get an achievement for it. Not to mention the game comes with an autosave option, so you can just reload the autosave afterwards.\n-Even when you chose the male or the female avatar, the main character is still relatively ambiguous. Personally, I like this, but some people seem to dislike playing a female character that is not obviously female.\n-Copious amounts of cats\n\nPossible flaws:\n-I couldn't help but feel like some characters of cast were easier to get than others. Which I suppose make sense, but sometimes I had to go out of my way to make bad choices for every member of cast except the love interest I was aiming for, and as a result I feel like Avery in that run didn't cultivate a strong relationship with their co-workers.\n-Some people may not enjoy that the protagonist is a total slob.\n-The begining of the game can get really repetative really fast. The \"skip\" feature is a little lacking, as it doesn't speed up any of the camera panning, and sometimes it just randomly stops altogether.\n\n\nIn conclusion, this may not necessarily be everyboy's cup of tea, but I do heavily reccomend it.\n(Also I'm not entirely sure why it's marked as a \"horror\". It has some tense moments, sure, but that's just it's story, and to be honest once you've played through it once, those moments hold no tension at all.

Far as I can tell, it doesn't seem to affect the story aside from pronouns as the characters seem to all be bi/pansexual anyway... or \"Averysexual\" if you'd rather use that term :3c)\n\nCons:\n-Occasional glitches/bugs (I've had the game freeze up on me once; be sure to save and save often! That and the gallery stops letting you click on images after you view a few of them)\n-Have to take screenshots the old-fashioned way: printscreen and Paint (if Steam screenshots would've been worked in, that would've been fantastic... but that's a nitpick)\n-Would've liked more save slots (you get eight, but this is just me being nitpicky again)\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this game.

I also really appreciate that the game gives you the option to pick your appearance and gender right at the start, so you can play as either a boy or a girl (there is also a non-binary option). \n\nI quickly found myself becoming attached to every single one of the characters, even the ones I didn't like at first. Everyone is given a pretty interesting - and sometimes kind of depressing - backstory that makes you really end up empathizing with them. (For example, Reese, who I initially disliked, ended up being my favorite character after I played his route.) As for the romance and mature content, there's nothing in the game that would get a YouTube video flagged, if you know what I mean. There's some kissing (Reese and Hayes have some rather adorable blushing scenes) and a bit of language, but that's it, really. Just a lot of tender moments.\n\nOh, and did I mention that this game has some pretty decent music? Most of the tunes are actually pretty catchy. The piano/love theme was just downright beautiful, and has even made me consider buying the soundtrack.\n\nThe only thing I disliked about the game was that even once you've finished all the routes, including the secret one, you're still left with questions about the story. I'm not sure if the developers intended to leave loose ends or if they're planning on releasing more content, [spoiler]I REALLY would have liked to find out the reason behind Graves being cursed by Nacht and what the details were with their past relationship[/spoiler] but I just hate being left hanging!!\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a somewhat lighthearted dating sim with a little bit of mystery - and not to mention cats - then you'll probably enjoy this wonderful charmer of a game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1514870453, "timestamp_updated": 1514870453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38957740": {"recommendationid": "38957740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347127591", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 148, "last_played": 1515117459}, "language": "english", "review": "Hustle Cat is a super great game and I'd definitely reccomend it to anyone who likes cats, story-rich games, dating sims, or all three.

The length is about 9 hours I would say to do every route (I left mine running accidentally on the main menu for about 4 or 5 hours and that's why my time is higher). There is a lot of repetitive dialogue but there is a fast forward feature so that helps out. You can also save multiple files and at any point - there are two auto save slots as well, though there aren't that many decisions that you would need to save for. Routes get locked in fairly early and once you are locked into a route, I don't remember there being any other choices. Once your romantic interest is locked in, the story sort of just plays out from there. \n\nThe story itself is a pretty straightforward set up - you're working your first job at a cat cafe with cute coworkers (both male and female romantic options, as well as you can decide what pronouns your character goes by). There's witchcraft involved and the same basic beats are hit in each route. But what I really enjoyed about this game was the writing - it's very modern, with very distinct character tones throughout. This is definitely not the normal stiff otome writing which I quite enjoyed. Your character has a very set personality, for better or worse. Personally I liked it but I could see that it would annoy some people.\n\nThe low points - the game is repetitive and maybe a bit short, the music wasn't that great (I never used headphones), nothing is voiced.

If you run away from the cafe the games ends with you being stuck as a cat forever because you never go back. Err, sorry, but if I was suddenly a cat and the only way of being human was to be at the cafe and break my curse I would do that before storming out. How dumb.\n\nConsidering that the all the character routes were reparted it would have been a way to mix things up a little, maybe on the Hayes route, he prefers being a cat and it would have been esier to get to know him if you were both the same, and as the magic book is discovered at work it wouldn't be a problem for them to study it together at the cafe.\n\nIt was also very unsatisfactory to discover that the MC broke the cat curse before it took hold simply because you started playing with a stolen magic book and began teaching yourself spells; your don't even get some challanges to help your discover your magic or a choice of what that magic should be. Its just trash because the MC is a disgusting pig who can't pick up after herself and clean her apartment.\n\nA plus point is that all the characters are different and have distinct personalities and problems, but the varity of the routes is ruined by the the script, which is lazy with each route having the same lay out; a date, a day at work, and the assult on the street by Nacht, and all of them using the same dialogues in placed between choices. Seriously, the fast forward button is just not fast enough in skipping through these sections. (Plus I discovered that using the fast forward button to frequently caused the game to crash.)\n\nThe images are inconsistant as well, in the Reese route the MC 'cleans' her place before letting her guest in, but the next morning the image goes back to the messy one, seems like the dev's picked the wrong image.\n\nThe endings were also the same with Nacht disposing of all the characters who you aren't dating while the MC does something stupid which results in your date coming to your rescue. Even timid little Hayes breaks character to come to your rescue. I realise this is all fiction but I found it hard to suspend my disbelieve here; the MC was supposed to have had the magic book, broken her curse, and been praticing for weeks yet is completely useless. While your date manages to break their curse and become a better witch in just a couple of days. We can forgive Landry and Reese to some extent because we discover that they are inheeritly magical anyway, but for the others it just doesn't work.\n\nAll of the endings are capped off with a little epilogue that doesn't explain why Nacht is after Graves, plenty of hints are given that it is not just about witches claiming new territory but you don't get a proper explaination. Not even at the end of the Graves route, when I expected all the answers and got nothing. You don't even get a proper epilogue with Graves about how they move their relationship on, you kiss after the fight with Nacht and the game ends. Where the devs are stretching bounderies with gay and non-binary options for the MC, it seems a relationship with a older guy was just too hard for them work with, so why bother offering it? Disappointing.\n\nTime was also a problem for me of Graves's route, in all the other routes he is turned to rust instantly, but in his route he is able to resist the effects of it to come to the MC's rescue for over 24 hours. Yawn, backing tracking on five previous plotlines just to make his ending the same as the others makes no sense.\n\nI loved the artwork and the concept, its just a pity that the devs didn't take some more time to write different cut scenes or offer more choices, after six routes all following the same patterns and choices the game ended up feeling repetative and samey. \n\nLess is more, as they say, and with more effort being placed into a smaller 'dating pool' this could have been more amusing than it was.", "timestamp_created": 1514816181, "timestamp_updated": 1514816181, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38936418": {"recommendationid": "38936418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100355240", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1516368051}, "language": "english", "review": "I had so much fun playing this game, I recommend it!", "timestamp_created": 1514814321, "timestamp_updated": 1514814321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38892368": {"recommendationid": "38892368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198434695628", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514758400}, "language": "english", "review": "I really love this game. \n\nI'm not a very big fan of VN dating games, but I like some of them, and this is one of the good ones.  \nWith a cute art style and some complex date-able characters, this game does a good job of mixing the two to create a nice, solid story with a ton of cats and a bonus hot goth guy.

You can also choose between three skin tones. This is a really nice feature.\n\nOne thing I do dislike, is that the common route is 2/3 of the game, with the main romance part of each person's route is only about 1/3. The common route gets a bit boring/repetitive after two routes. Otherwise that's my main complaint for the game. A few others would be: the music sort of stops at times until you progress some more, saving the first time took awhile, two of the CGs are bugged, game could have been fleshed out a lot more, steam overlay does not work (so no screenshots), the protag also doesn't turn into a cat (not a big deal, but I was kind of disappointed that we didn't, would have been kind of cute), and a few others (but I kind of forgot at the moment.)\n\nThere are six love interests. Four males and two females. They are all unique and adorable. To unlock the sixth character, you have to complete the other five routes. Each route ends with the same thing [spoiler] fighting the rust witch, Nacht. [/spoiler] They are all done in their own unique ways, but are ultimately fairly similar.\n\nThis game did surprise me. I went into the game, not really expecting anything, just curious how it was going to play out the whole thing of dating people who ae also cats. I was thinking it would be something on the Hatoful Boyfriend level. It was not. It is a little more serious than that, though still has very humourous moments. There were also some side characters that I feel should have gotten fleshed out. Like the [spoiler] police woman who is friends with Finley, the witch the shows up in Landry's route, and the witch that shows up in Reese's route. [/spoiler] I really enjoyed those side characters, even though they were on screen for less than a minute each, some more depending how the story went. Granted those characters weren't the main focus, but they interested me. Same with the main antagonist. I kind of wanted more out of him [spoiler] and the way he was dealt with in the end. Like why the hell was he after Graves. None of that was explained or fleshed out. [/spoiler]\n\nOverall, there could have been more. Might be nice to see some extra content in the future, but not sure if that would happen. I rec getting the game.

But all the characters issues are nice too. Some are fairly lame, but such is life. (Some are perfect, like Mason and Landry.) My biggest complaint is that the game wouldnt let you skip parts youve seen before. There is a fast forward section (which I used thoroughly) but I still had to redo everything after the \"omg Im going to quit!\" part (because no thank you to redoing the theme song every time) every single route, Which, I guess for six routes, that isn't that bad, but still.

Took 4 hours approx. Found it to be a short, but pretty enjoyable romantic visual novel.  Plenty of replay value for all the different endings (including at least 2 bad endings).\n\nThe story is fairly cute... it does have a lot of cats after all.  Although there are some serious elements, which I suspect change based on which character you date.  Finley's arc for example [spoiler] deals briefly with cyber bullying and stalking [/spoiler], and of course there is some body horror that the main story revolves around, which was unexpected, although fairly lightweight, and if you avoid the bad endings it all seems to end of a happy note.\n\nAlthough on that body horror part, strangely the player character took it a lot better than I as the player did.  Guess they had to to keep the story on a cheerful note [spoiler] seriously, I think I would tried inflicting bodily harm on Greeves in an attempt to lift the curse as my instinctive reaction rather than just accepting it and getting on with the job as Avery did. [/spoiler]. But then again its not exactly going for serious grimdark.\n\nWas a little disappointed that the various dialogue options largley end at the half way point, once your love interest has established.  After this its pretty much a straight visual novel playing itself out, but I enjoyed where the story went and it based itself around my relationship with said love interest, so can't complain.\n\nAlso, the ending for my once through left some big plot holes, specifically [spoiler] the reason behind the curse was never explained, although I can guess its the price of becoming an apprentice witch, but only Reese read the small print and knew to ask Greeves for magic lessons. Avery was self taught, but only because Greeves gave her the cipher[/spoiler].  But as there is a secret ending after you complete it with everyone else, I'm assuming all will be revealed then, and so its one of those games where you need to play through several routes before everything falls into place.\n\nOverall, I'm definitely going to replay this dating Mason.

You can't pick your own name unfortunately but in all honesty that was the only little bump I encountered with this game, the price is also a lot higher than I like it to be, but waiting for sales is never a bad thing! I will also say the writing is a bit short, but it kinda helps me out because I am extremely lazy when it comes to Otome games because they take FOREVER to get to the parts I want. So the short writing was good for me and helped me complete it without boredom.\nOtherwise, it was just, dare I say perfect! I am a HUGE cat lover, and it was so lovely seeing a game like this, so the cat bit lured me in, but hell, when I started playing it I was amazed. First off, you are allowed to pick your own pronouns, including they/them, which just proves the game is extremely inclusive, there were also multiple skin colors to choose from when picking your certain look. That wasn't even the end though, not only were there routes for the guys but routes for the girls too. Of course, me being as gay as I am I went for Finley first, [who I absolutely adore haha], and I fell in love with her and her route. \nI was VERY impressed by this game, although it may not seem too long it is, and it is very story filled. Although I must say the waiting for romance was VERY difficult considering I got so attached so quickly, so I was obviously itching for something to happen. Don't worry though, you definitely get the romance you play for. \nThe art is absolutely adorable! I love the style of this game, especially the way the cats are drawn. \nThe characters are absolutely wonderful and you just end up falling for them in a heartbeat, the moment I saw and got to know them even slightly my heart melted with joy. I got so attached that when I completed Finley's route I was so sad! \n\nOverall, this game is DEFINITELY worth it. Especially if you're looking for an inclusive otome game that will give you major feelings and lots of happy moments. And if you love cats as much as I do. \n10/10 would recommend to anyone thinking about getting it. I was skeptical at first but I finally decided to get it and it was the best choice I made.

It might not look like much at first look, but it's everything an otome should be. \n\nFirst, a relatable main character. With an actual personnality. Bonus points : you can choose whether you want Avery to be a she, a he or a they - not something you see often in otomes (there are also a few customization options, including skin color). Second, the datable characters are all lovable and interesting in their own way, and you can date girls as well as boys. No yanderes, no push over, nothing cringy or borderline non-con like we usually get, if you want something cute and 100% consensual this is it. I played all the routes, expecting some of them to be downright annoying but even though I have my preferences I enjoyed them all. And third, the setting. You get to work in a cat caf\u00e9 which is all kinds of amazing in itself, with the added bonus that all the employees can turn into cats themselves. I mean, sure, it's a bit of a stretch, but we've had people-turned-into-pets before (Dandelion) and stuff even less... likely (Hatoful Boyfriend, My Horse Prince) so really, nothing we haven't seen before. \n\nAnd it's funny. Like, really funny, with a lot of pop culture references because Avery is a nerd and I often found myself laughing at their lines. Some scenes even got me tearing up a little. The story is surprisingly compelling, the relationship with every character is sweet and cute and never feels forced or cheap, and the dialogues are delightful. I should add that there's a real story besides the romance aspect. And there's even a - very satisfying - secret route. Also, cats. The art is good, although I felt the CGs were a bit rushed sometimes? The gameplay is overall standard but that's really all we ask from a visual novel. I should warn that the game can be a bit buggy though. Took me time to unlock the secret route because my save files kept disappearing and I had to start all over again (thank god there's a skip option), which was really annoying. That's the only negative thing I can say about this game though. ...Did I mention there were cats?\n\n And with it being on sale right now, do yourself a favor, don't hesitate: grab it!", "timestamp_created": 1511396547, "timestamp_updated": 1511480200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36860751": {"recommendationid": "36860751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156340948", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508257948}, "language": "english", "review": "Could I possibly be a furry?

Overall, there are 6 routes to choose from [spoiler]including a hidden route ooo[/spoiler] with a wide range of characters with different personalities and stories. \n\nTo be honest, when I first started the game I didn't fall in love with a character straight away (like I usually do in otome games), but as the story progressed I began to see the personalities of each character and understand why so many people are obsessed with them.\n\nNow, I only have one route left and I LOVE ALL MY BBS (especially Mason and Reese <3) and I am so happy that each romance route has been so carefully thought out (except maybe Landry, in my opinion).\n\n\nPros:\n- Choice of skin colour, pronouns, hair length\n- CUTE AF GAME W/ SOME SQUEAL-WORTHY ARTWORK\n- Each character is different (personalities, backstories etc.)\n- Good background music AND the intro music is great too!\n- The writing is so great: casual yet intriguing, very refreshing to read\n- Gotta love those easy achievements\n- Autosaving and manual saving\n\nNeutral:\n- Although this hasn't happened to me -- and I have a 2011 Mac -- a few players have experienced their game crash, but luckily the autosaving is usually a real life-saver (pun intended)\n\nCons:\n- Landry's route lmao (I do like him as a character tho + he has v cute artwork in his route!!!)\n- To be serious, this game can get repetitive, despite the different routes. So, I recommend taking a break every two or so routes/gameplays from the game, to fully savour the experience.\n\nI 100% recommend this VN, it has certainly become one of my favourite games!

The first thing would be that it randomly shuts itself off frequently enough to where if you don't save the game too much you'll have to sit through a bunch of dialogue you've already seen to catch up to where you were. In those instances it's easy to fix so long as you expect that issue by saving very often. However the thing that just happened that irritated me to no end is this. I just finnished every route except for the secret route. The game then froze, which made my computer then freeze after a minute making me have to turn off my computer because it wasn't unfreezing on it's own. I restart everything, load up the game and then lo and behold all of my progress is ruined. I now have to beat the game AGAIN with all characters because all of the progress was erased. All the gallery Images that were unlocked were gone, all of my save files were corrupted so I can't just load up the previous routes I've beaten so I can at least just get the secret ending.

The game places basically no importance on your chosen gender, too - no homophobia or locked-out romance options here, folks!\n\nThe interface in general was really nice and very well-designed - a nice change from the same Ren'py layout every second VN uses! - although I would have appreciated a faster skip button and more than 8 save slots. (I'm a save-scummer, what can I say.)\n\nThe characters are generally cute and interesting, with witty dialogue and nice vibes. However, I didn't find myself getting as personally attached to them as I have to other VN characters - I'm not sure whether this is something to do with the writing or because of the short amount of time I got to spend with each of them. (The routes I played only took an hour or two each from start to finish, and less with skipping.) Their sprites (and Avery's!) are all well-done, with a decent variety of poses and facial expressions. \n\nOnce you make a few choices about your first few days (who do you follow around? do you try to sneak a donut or not?) you're basically locked into a romance with one character and only have (I think) one more choice to make[spoiler], which barely even counts considering one of the two options leads to an instant game over[/spoiler]. Don't get me wrong, each route is cute in its own way, but I wouldn't have minded more personalization in your interactions with your crush, or even the ability to get a bad or neutral ending.  (Or even the ability to not romance anyone? I would have been really interested in friendship routes as well!) Also, there aren't many choices provided when you ARE given decisions to make, which makes it hard to really personalize Avery. (That being said, the writing is overall very good, they're a cute, funny, relatable protag, and I generally liked and agreed with them, so I wasn't too mad about this.) Depending on your priorities and what you like in a VN, this may or may not be a problem for you. \n\nAs for the wider story - you really do have to play multiple routes to get a sense of what's going on, otherwise you're left with more questions than answers at the end. It's also paced a bit weirdly - there's a lot of time spent on introducing the cafe and the characters, some time spent at work slowly getting to know everyone, one or two cute dates [spoiler]and a magic scene[/spoiler] with your crush of choice where it feels like you just start to get to know them and then [spoiler]BAM, creepy magic guy shows up with no explanation, there's a very quick showdown, he's defeated and that's basically the end of the game. (It also seemed a bit weird to me that all the characters just kind of accepted that they'd been cursed to turn into cats - like, were they really not mad about being unable to be human outside one cafe? Do they not have outside friends or family who wonder why they never see them anymore? Neighbours? Landlords? It's not really addressed that well beyond \"Graves is a nice guy and I guess it's our fault for not reading our employment contracts more closely\", and while it didn't bother me so much in-game it's left me wondering once I finished.)[/spoiler] I also wanted to be able to spend more time with the characters and get them out of their shells more - even though you're dating and it's cute, you only effectively get a couple of days \"together\" before the game ends (and much of that is either skipped or just kinda brushed over), and it doesn't always feel like you the player got to know the characters very well. \n\nOverall, though, I enjoyed my time with Hustle Cat, and I'm really only critiquing it so heavily because I see a lot of potential in it. It was a fun, cute time for anyone who likes light urban fantasy and VNs. I definitely wouldn't pay $19.99 for it, though - try to get it on sale if you can.

When I looked up a summary about this, I thought it was quite interesting and decided to buy it during the deal. Since I love reading lots of visual novel, I said why the heck not. I decided to play on multiple of routes and after playing for a while, I saw some good things about it and also the bad ones. \n\nSome pros: \n+ I love the art style. It gives the overall game a relaxing theme in the game. \n+ The songs are catchy and fits well with the situation. \n+ Interesting character personalities. Even the main character her/himself is interesting. \n\nSome cons: \n- Music tends to stop here and there. I kind of understand what the creator was trying to do (such as building up tension and such in different situations), but at the same time, the music is suppose to be there to keep the reader from losing their attention from the game. Many games have music playing on repeat (even with environmental sounds in the background), so when there's nothing but soft, environmental sounds, it didn't feel right anymore. It might be different for some people, but for me, I did not enjoy it as much. \n- The plot was questionable. Not only did it felt rushed, but there were a lot of things that was left unsaid. It is fine to have some things left in question for the readers to figure out, but when there's nothing around the plot that can be easily theorized, it just left the players questioning what is going on overall. \n- The game crashes sometimes even while I'm playing or skimming through the routes. Sometimes, I get to the next scene (when the scene fades to black), and then I'm left there, waiting for more than a few minutes in darkness before it crashes the game. \n-Main character is \"customizable\" but not to an extent. I thought the layout of it was cool and interesting, but the way it was done was not that exciting. When I found out (after trying to click the box) that I could not change the name, I felt disappointed. Seeing a character profile sheet laid out almost made me think I can actually change the name, skills, and other things. I feel that it was better to have a different layout to choose a character instead. \n\n\nOverall, I did like the game, but not to an extent.

Also, no sex whatsoever.\n\nThe ending, however, feels somewhat simplistic, hurried perhaps?, and left me kind of disappointed, not very willing to go back and play a different story-line, as I imagined this would have been, for the most part, replaying the same story with just a different character being romanced. BTW I got in a same-sex relationship with Finley in my first playthrough, without trying: I was fine with it, although it felt a little sugary, lovey-dovey for my tastes.\n\nI cannot remember the last time I was able to finish a VN, without succumbing to continuous attacks of eye-roll-itis, so this gets my thumbs up: while not without flaws, I would say the positives prevail, and Hustle Cat is a relaxing, enjoyable experience that doesn't go anywhere terribly interesting in particular, being content with entertaining the player with a tale of finding friendship and love.", "timestamp_created": 1507926674, "timestamp_updated": 1507960371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35650576": {"recommendationid": "35650576", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972252098", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507438819}, "language": "english", "review": "The \"game\" isn't exactly interactive.

Fairly likable characters, okay sprites, and an enjoyable magic mystery storyline.\n\nOn the downside the common route takes up fully half of each route so after the first one it gets a little tedious fast forwarding in the others. My biggest complaint is the \"gender-neutral\" MC. You can choose the pronoun you want the NPCs to call you and pick shorter or longish hair for your sprite but you can't change the name. Also I don't feel that the MC works as a feminine character. Avery acts like a guy, interacts with the others like a  guy, and in the CGs has a wiry masculine frame. Avery seems very much like the protagonist of a BL otome. That's just my opinion though, YMMV.\n\nStill, I enjoyed this game and would recommend it to fellow VN/otome lovers.\n\n(Oh and PS.

It can be fine  for maybe one or two playthroughs if its not interupted it depends on your system I suppose....\nPros from this is you read back on your route from when you started its actually really refreshing to have such a ability because most games do not give you a chance. \n\n2. Pricing. \nIts a little too hefty considering the overall size...plus they were a patraon so this could be considered bonus payment? I think this is more worth \u00a35 - \u00a310 but thats personal oppinion \n\n3. Story length.\nIt lost a lot of potential, they could of done a lot more with this as a whole, the idea and concept was there and their was so much oppertunity to go more indeph and provide more splinterring routes or even buff off main routes\nTheirs a lot of time skips and you nonchaluntly have to accept that you and your aimed partner have gotten closerm that you found the realization of love.\nIts well put together though but its just a shame\n\n4. No Cat Form.\nI guess this a spoiler but....Yeah...Theirs no chance to mistakingly become a cat or intentionally to be one (disincluding a certain route because it ends as it starts, you can't even expand on it as nothing is done by the characters to find Avery after that point) It seems a little stilted to not have this apart of the story.\n\n5. Lack of choice. \nI half heartedly say this point but theirs so many alternative how things could go without a simple action not done.\n\n6. Revealment / Pacing.\nFrom something you didn't know becoming known....It's done a little brokenly...I can understand with Reese   but Hayes was a little iffy... I am not sure anyone who just started would accept it in that time span? I don't know with this but maybe giving it  2 or days?

Many tend to either pin you with basically no ways to change the plot and just present it like it's an actual novel, or have the protagonist do things to woo potential dates that don't fit with the protagonist's personality/are basically lying to get characters to like you. This game does neither, which is great to see. First off, the protagonist (Avery Grey) has a rather defined personality, and some very amusing dialogue. Secondly, while some of the stuff gets repetitive (they have a fast forward feature probably for that reason) the story is very engaging and how things play out does change with each path--at least in how the end is reached. The only two 'bad' paths are ones that are fairly easy to find and avoid (or do--they've got achievements for both and they're both worth looking at, even if you only do them the one time) and won't force you to totally restart the story or anything like that. \n\nAll the characters are fun, interesting, and have more depth to them than many dating sim ones do--no completely shallow stereotypes here! Also, while Avery is set personality and dialogue wise, you can (somewhat) choose their appearance and you can choose their pronouns as well (she/her, he/him, OR they/them). Also you can date whoever you want, no matter what pronouns you went with, and to boot you can change the pronouns at any time from the main menu when you've started a game as well. \n\nOverall, if you like cats (and some other stuff) and dating cute coworkers while working in a... mysterious cat cafe, I'd absolutely recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1507335101, "timestamp_updated": 1507335101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35529348": {"recommendationid": "35529348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119403298", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512166189}, "language": "english", "review": "I couldn't hardly put this down for a week and I am constantly giving my fiance a hard time about playing games.

Not the best, but solid. The story is fairly strong, though after you've settled into a route it starts to railroad you pretty hard. Some of the options are pretty obviously the wrong one, and the really, absolutely vital relationship decisions are made for you. The choices you do make are more geared towards deciding what route you'll be going down. If you're a fast reader, you can finish a route in an hour.\n\nThe art is well done, and this is one of the few visual novels I've played where you have at least a small character creation section. While you can't rename your character, you can pick from six different appearances: 3 with longer hair that are slightly more feminine, and 3 with shorter hair that are slightly more masculine. You can also pick your character's pronouns, and switch them at any point during the game.\n\nHowever, the differences in character appearance really boil down to hair length and skin colour.

Often. Try to save regularily, if you don't want to have to use the skip button eighteen times a run.\n\nStory:\nUnless one has played every route, both the main storyline as well as some of the characters behaviour and motivations is very obscure. Some routes reveal a bit about the others (Reese explains some about the main storyline, Landry about Mason, etc), but for a full picture one has to play all (and even then it leaves a few things open, sadly).\nBut the story was interesting and quirky and I especially loved the character progression in each route.\nSo the most important part is: this is NOT a cute, common dating sim!\nDon't go in expecting to spend the entire run playing with cats and flirting with your guy/gal.\nThere are sceletons, dubstep, fire, rust (loads of rust actually, someone should clean that up xD), vampires? and possibly marine butterflies.\nThe game is weird and has a really obscure feel to it in it's humour. Let's just say I was giving a very, very simplified summary of a scene that got my attention in my friends group chat and they got so confused and intrigued that they now bought it as well (and they haven't regreted it to my knowledge yet).\n\nCharacters:\nFirst of all, while the main character suffers from the occasional idiocy (let's run head first into a guy with a baseball bat, what could go wrong?!), they are relateable, cute and amusing to read along with (and I say \"they\" since you can chose the gender).\nThe other characters all come together in typical harem style: the cool type, the cute type, the shy one, the tsundere, etc. But nice is that all have a layer underneath (they're sweet or insecure or or or) which makes exploring their route fun, including learning a bit about who they are and how they ended up in the cafe. No one feels unecessary and the endings with everyone helping you is always quite heartwarming.\nMy personal favorites would be Mason and Hayes, but everyone is absolutely lovely and adorable during their respective route and I couldn't surpress grinning like an idiot whenever the inevitable started.\n\nArt:\nThe art is solid, pretty much. Both the character and background drawings look a bit rough and smudgy, but it's charming and coherent, so it doesn't disturb in the least. And though the UI is flashy in colours, one soon stops noticing it. Plus, I really love title screens where you can see your progress.\n\nAudio:\nThe game has a soundtrack of - what - six songs? It's a small game and music usually eats most of it, so people complaining about how repetetive it is obviously never made a small VN. The music at least never is annoying (I actually enjoyed listening to it, it's a bit cheesy but works with the mood most of the time and it could be way more jarring). The use of NO music is also used smartly whenever it happens, making you drop for a second every time.\nThere aren't any sounds of notice but that might be a good thing since certain games can become annoying with it.\n\nRoutes/Endings:\nThe game has six route endings and two Game Overs.\nThe first half of the routes is (almost) always identical and defines who you chose to be your darling, the second half then splits to the path of that character up until the end.\nBe aware that this game is what I call a 2.5 kinetic novel. It has choices, but those only define who to date. Once you are in a route, you barely get a choice anymore and are only left with reading what happens. If you want to be able to meddle in everything, have a say to stuff and such, then this game will be very underwhelming (big props to the job interview though, I have never been this amused by choices).\nIt's also fairly easy to figure out when you're gonna get locked into a Game Over, but if you're into VNs as much as me, then you're probably wanna try and see them anyway.\n\nOther:\nWhile it would be a lie to say that this is the best VN I have ever played (there are some small typos and repeating words for example, there's also a bug where two CGs won't appear in the gallery despite having been seen in-game), it is definitely a lot of fun, quite interesting and very intriguing.\nAnd hey, it has cats, dubstep and loads of lemonade (and Dracula), so you could hardly want more ;)", "timestamp_created": 1507028097, "timestamp_updated": 1507028097, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35429354": {"recommendationid": "35429354", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997506993", "num_games_owned": 802, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 1070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507067517}, "language": "english", "review": "Hustle Cat is a visual novel/simple dating sim.

Quirky, cuddly and witty, Hustle Cat is really worth the time for any otome fan and a great starting point for those curious about them. It's not perfect but it's a charming game for sure. \n\nThe game is a joy to look at with a cartoonish art style and colourful palette. The soundtrack contains some catchy music - my personal highlight is the opening song, which I had in my head for several days. The characters are all likeable and there's a route for everyone here.  In all it took me about 10 to 11 hours to complete the game 100% and it was well worth the price I paid.\n\nHighlights:\n- Avery is a great protagonist. They have some very witty writing behind them and they ended up being my favourite character.\n- The inclusion of allowing players to choose how Avery looks and their pronouns was such a welcome addition. \n- The story is short but intriguing, Each route offers something a little different and there's a bigger mystery to solve throughout them all. \n- This game can be hilarious. There's some very funny writing here which had me laughing a lot. \n- Good selection of romance routes that contain some nice character development and relatable moments.\n- I'll mention it again but the art style is so good! The cats look adorable, the characters are all unique in design and the backgrounds  help to cleary set each scene.\n\nImprovements:\nThe only thing I felt was that a few of the routes could of been a little longer. Some seemed to end rather abruptly after a point. Either a slightly longer epilogue for each route or a little more time before it gets to the climatic point would of helped flesh out the romances just that tad it needed.\n\nOverall Hustle Cat is the type of game which is great to just chill out and take your time with. Its short length won't demand too much of your time and if you're looking for your romance fix without the 30+ hour investment of some bigger titles, you really should look no further. Its an enjoyable read with very cute cats and characters. Avery will continue to be one of my favourite protagonists in a visual novel for quite some time (I love their dry humour) and the setting is one I wish to re-visit on more replays. \n\nIt's not without fault, but if you're looking for something sweet, filled with cats and a little magic, seriously give this a go.", "timestamp_created": 1504997035, "timestamp_updated": 1504997841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.711435", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34723817": {"recommendationid": "34723817", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097998007", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463439187}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of my favourite otomes ever <3 I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a good story and interesting characters!", "timestamp_created": 1504481354, "timestamp_updated": 1504481354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34704946": {"recommendationid": "34704946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200489242", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509994668}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really nice game.

The game treats love as just love, without having to characterize in some way. The player has the option to chose their labels as they please, without judgement or negative acknowlegment from the game or the interactive characters. You're treated as person, not as a gender.

So that might be something that should be checked out. Also sometimes the fastforward button would just stop working for no reason, and that was really bothersome. \n\nOverall, though, it was an incredible. \n\nThank you, Date Nighto.

I've only completed Finley's route, but it's just unbearably cute. Each character seems to have a pretty well defined personality, and they all seem likable in their own ways.

It's not always clear to know where you get \"points\" that add up for each character (how the game determines who your 'love interest' will be) but that's what makes it fun. I think there were a few options that were clear they'd lead me down a good path with Finley so I, of course, chose those because her character is just so damn adorable (so is her cat, I want to squeeze it - can I squeeze it? How would you even squeeze an animated visual novel cat? Get back to me on that....) \n\nMaybe I'm a sucker for ridiculously adorable cartoon cats (I mean, not only are the cat-people cats adorable AF, but the cafe cats in the backgrounds are adorable AF - and I'm a crazy bird lady, so that says a lot about how cute the cats are <- ok, I like adorable things. Sue me ok?). Regardless, the art style s great, the story is good (Only through one route so there are some holes in teh plot that I am hoping will get filled in as I progress, but from other reviews it seems they might not all get filled in, which is a bumer - but the game is still worth playing, and the story is still really good) and I just have so much fun reading through it.

I'd rate this game a 7.5/10. Although it is a wonderful game, there are some minor flaws that I hope will be improved in the future.\n\nThe first thing this game did right was to include three different pronouns, two different hairstyles and three different skin tones for the MC! There were also two female and four male love interests. Each character had different personalities and backstories, while the MC was both snarky and relatable. Art, although sometimes inconsistent, was beautiful.\n\nHowever, the game was a little buggy and would often crash once in a while. I might be nitpicking here too - but the fast forward button was still pretty slow. Ctrl+Tab to access steam in game + F12 to screenshot do not work. Other than technical / programming errors, I felt that the story was very repetitive (at least for the first five love interests that you would be romancing). The overarching storyline is the same - for each of the five characters, you would experience the same common route and (almost) the same conflict and ending. Furthermore, after the common route ends and your love interest has been chosen, there is no further choices that you make. There is no bad ending.\n\nThis visual novel is also pretty short, which might make the drama, conflict and romance seemed a little rushed. Graves' story (I assume it is the true ending since it ties all the loose ends from the other routes together) - was different from the rest and made it a little less boring to read. My favourite routes were Graves and Reese.\n\nOverall, I would recommend buying this game on sale - especially if you love light-hearted romance, nothing too serious... and cats! You can never have enough cats.

Zero regrets. It was a pleasant way to spend a day. It took me about 10 hours to reach 100% completion (consider that I used the fast forward button a lot during replays). Despite completing the game, I enjoyed it enough that I would consider replaying it later. It's definitely a decent addition to your library, especially on discount. I have paid more for far worse. \n\nAs a plus point, you can pick from 6 player avatars of different skin tones, and also pick your own pronouns (he, she, they).  I don't know why more games don't do this. Best part is that you can switch the pronouns anytime during the game, so you can use whatever you're comfortable with to complement the character you end up dating ingame. It's a very nice detail.\n\nDo note the game will sometimes crash. Save often! Sometimes it crashes when saving too.\n\n[b]Story:[/b] I was expecting it to be a lighthearted game where cats turn into people and all you do is flirt to get their attention while drowning in catnip and inneundo. The story turned out to be more complex as you find out more about the cat curse. However, your options to deal with the curse are limited. Your focus remains on interacting with the other characters to decide whose route to land on. Each character is well-written and I loved each of their personalities. They felt realistic, and I would I love to know them in real life. I wish there would be a sequel or extra side stories. [spoiler]Maybe put the characters in an AU?[/spoiler]\n\nThere are a total of 6 routes, including the secret Graves route (unlocked after you complete all the other routes). There are several common scenes with very slight variations. Fortunately, there is a fast forward button to speed through them if you want. There is only 1 ending per character, and 2 common bad endings. On average, it took me 1.5 to 2 hours per route.\n\nThe story was original enough to get my attention. It has its cute moments and is peppered with humour. However, it could have used more depth. Only one route ([spoiler]Mason[/spoiler]) explored the difficulties they face from the curse e.g. [spoiler]Mason pretends she's a regular cat so she can spend time at the corner store. Aside from that, how long has everyone been cats? Doesn't anyone realise, especially Landry whose parents live in the city? And it would have been cool to see all their apartments or wherever else they hang out as cats outside work.[/spoiler] Ok, so maybe this isn't a priority since it's really all about Avery, but it would have made the story better.\n\nI thought everything would be explained in Graves's route (common for secret routes), but his ending was rather abrupt. I was disappointed that they didn't fully explain about his past [spoiler]with Nacht[/spoiler], and about how this whole situation happened. I think a DLC prequel or sidestory would help close the loop.\n\n[b]Music/Sound:[/b] There is no voice-acting, which is fine because the dialogue and characters' expressions manage to capture the tone. The opening theme song doesn't appeal to me but the rest of the music is on point. They even throw in some sound effects during the story.

Would definitely recommend at sale price. Would probably recommend at full price. Basically if you've got the money to spend and are not bothered by anything you see. (if you want to know how long it takes: my total time is how long it took me to finish every route, get every CG & achievement, aaand I nodded off while it was running for almost an hour once.) Anyway. I love dating sims, and overall, I would say I had fun with this one. \n\nPros: \nThe storylines are cute, even the routes I liked the least had charming parts. Also I looove Reese's route it was so adorable. My heart melted. (Reese is 100% best boy pls date him.) \nConcept is interesting and unique as far as I know, (spoilersbutnotreally): all the characters are under a curse that turns them into cats when they leave the cafe. \nSaid curse is broken by learning magic, and each character has a unique type of magic that they learn, develop, and then use to beat down the bad guy (well, Hayes and Finley's magic are a bit similar imo. But they're still all cool and impressive). \nThe characters are pretty neat and most of them are easy to connect to emotionally. I even felt for Nacht a bit at the very end. \nCats are consistently drawn very very cute.\nYou get to choose pronouns plus a character portrait. Cast is diverse! This is particularly exciting because it is not something you see very frequently in dating sims or VNs. \nOverall I'd say it has the makings of a pretty solid dating sim-type VN. And it feels like it was made with love!\n\nCons (I'm nitpicky, sorry. There's a lot here but I still enjoyed the game overall and would recommend. Well, unless there's anything here that's a dealbreaker for you.): \nStorylines are almost the exact same until about the halfway point no matter whose route you're on, which can get boring, especially because the skip option is rather slow and doesn't work if the window isn't at the front (for me, anyway).\nArt for some characters looks a bit inconsistent between some of their portraits and CGs. And while probably most of the art looks pretty nice, some looks rather unfinished.\nYou can't change the character's name, and the differences between the feminine/masculine portraits for Avery aren't there a lot of the time (in almost all of the CGs the only difference at all is the hairstyle.) And the more feminine portrait's body type is basically just very skinny and slightly femme but mostly androgynous. If you like that, more power to you.

Depending on your preferences, there may be a dud or two among the lineup. However, getting the full scope of backstories does enhance the game and its writing. Finishing just one or two routes would not be satisfying at all.\n\nYou do not get to choose your own name, and your customization options are limited. However, this allows for the art to be very nice quality. I thought the main character choices were cute and I was happy to be Avery. You do get to choose pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them). I stuck mostly with the longer-haired he/him choice through my playthroughs if that matters. \n\nGoing through each route can be tedious and repetitive, but that's what the skip button is there for. Unfortunately it is very formulaic in this way so your choices really only affect the last third of each story.\n\nYour romance options are also cute and I wouldn't say there's a \"bad\" choice. I would say that the writing is strongest on the locked route, but it was my least favorite couple.\n\nThis was really a great length for me as I am not one to spend hundreds of hours on a game. I do echo previous reviewers in saying that length vs price ratio is a little off--but not insanely so.

The characters were fun and engaging, the art was nice, and the game is about magic & cats. I got the game on sale after reading the other reviews because I kept seeing comments about how it was so short- and they were right. I managed to tear through the game in about 5-6 hours (Steam says ~7 which includes times I left it up while I worked on other things). I admire the devs for trying something quirky and fun.

(would be nice to skip right to the choices after already seen dialogue rather than waiting for the game to fast-forward)\n\n**not a con, but it would have been nice to input a custom name & possibly chosen sexual preference\n\n\nOverall, I think the pros outweigh the cons.

This game is very American in that the pieces are nice, minus the voice acting, but never seem to go together. (sorry if that is vague)\n \nPros-\n1.) The characters are really nicely done. They are a bit simple and fit a little too well in their character mold (the shy one, the goth one, the stereotype girly character, ect.) but they are easy to like. Even the side characters are well done.\n2.) The secret route is great!\n3.) The antagonist is pretty cool. I wish they had gone into more detail about him, but seeing as this is an otome (romances first and all) it's easy to let that slide.\n\n\nSide Note- Currently, there is a bug in the gallery.

The backgrounds are on point 100% of the time, while the character art can get inconsistant in different CGS - especially ones with a perspective skew-  and sometimes within the game (Landry's \"angry\" emote is slightly larger than his nuetral emotion, as well as has this weird slightly bolder outline on it).  Those things may seem nit-picky, but I'm a fellow artist and they're all polish stage features.\n\nAdditionally, as a player you get to pick both your gender and \"look\" (two hairstyle choices + differeing skin tones).  While a neat idea, I feel that this decision probably took away from the artist's control over the character art.  A project where you know exactly what the character looks like means more time to focus on CGs and really polish them.. I'm not particularly sure the feature was \"worth\" it, but it's definitely an interesting concept to roll with.  \n\nAs far as storyline and writing goes, this game does a fairly decent job.  There have been Japanese otome games from industry companies translated into English that honestly have worse storyline and continuity than this game (ie Norn 9 and Ozamafia, I'm looking at you).  \nYou play as Avery, the new kid on the block who stumbles across a job opening at a local cat cafe.  Soon, you'll find out that everyone inside is feline a bit funny. (Badumchh)\n\nAvery, the main character, has her (? I'll refer to \"her\" since that is how I played) own personality -- a key point a lot of games shy away from for max \"relatiability\" across many different audiences.  She's quirky and it works out really well to move the game along.  She doesn't fall into stereotypes of any one gender either -- sometimes she is being protected, other times she initiates the intimacy or does the protecting.  Even though she is quirky, she is deeper than a lot of games on the market will allow for.  \nThe biggest downfall to plotline is possibly the brievity of it all -- Short & Sweet definitely sums this up this game.

I was wrong. Albeit a nice little intro to the characters and art style, in my opinion the trailer doesn't do the game justice. That's not necessarily a bad thing, since I was very pleasantly surprised by how good the game actually is. I'm gonna talk about the characters and what I thought worked well about them.\n\n[b]Avery - the main protagonist[/b]\nAvery Gray is the character that you play as. You can choose your pronouns (he/she/they) as well as whether you look more masculine/feminine, and there are three skin tone choices. Avery is a preset character with his/her/their own behavioural traits, but the fact that the player can choose certain details about Avery grants a decent amount of immersion without taking away from the quirks of the character. In all cases, Avery has grey/silver hair with pink-red eyes. They are quite mischievous and dorky, and just a fun character to play as. Their interactions with the other characters range from tear jerking to hilarious. Avery is a fantastic protagonist. [spoiler]My only issue is that I still wonder what breed of cat Avery would have become if the curse had fully taken hold, though that's probably just my vice as a cat fanatic.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Mason[/b]\nMason is the archetypical \"too cool to care but warms up to you\" character. She's a woman of few words and says only what she feels necessary. She's serious looking and quite androgynous in style, much like the main character. Mason is the chef at A Cat's Paw and is an extremely talented cook. [spoiler]Mason's relationship with her grandfather is a very sweet part of the game, especially since she tries to stay around him even when he doesn't know it's actually her. I personally wish that Mason's backstory of delinquence was a little more developed but all in all, it was enough.\nUpon developing her relationship with Avery she becomes very protective of her, which I like a lot. The scenes where Mason stands off against Nacht are fantastic - you can feel the tension, and it's made better by the fact that Mason is blunt and a woman of few words. The whole \"Try it, punk\" attitude really adds a lot to the situation, and her angry pose is my favourite character pose in the entire game.\nI quite like Mason's cat form, though I'm not sure it suits her personality. I'd also like to know why her tail is crooked, or if it's linked to her delinquent past.\nI like how Mason's fire magic relates to the fact that she is a chef. It's very fitting in that respect, though something physically tougher would have also worked in my opinion.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Landry[/b]\nLandry is your typical \"nice guy\" character, full of smiles and fun to be around. He's a tall guy who's good at woodwork, and he puts this to use for the cats by building toys and towers for them in the cafe. [spoiler]The fact that Landry's cat form is a Maine coon is very fitting, as he is tall and dark in human form. His cat form seems to make the most sense, and his human mannerisms (such as taking long strides) seem relevant to his cat form too. His magic, however, I'm not so sure about. Don't get me wrong, I think electricity magic is very cool, but I'm not sure how well it relates to the character. This doesn't really take anything away from his story, though.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Hayes[/b]\nHayes is a quiet cutie who isn't very good at social interaction. Much like Mason (but for different reasons), it takes a while for him to warm up to Avery. He is the cafe's barista and is an expert at making coffee. He can often be found working in the kitchen alongside Mason. Hayes' character design lends itself well to his shy personality. [spoiler]Hayes being a Siamese seems to work well, and his character portraits in cat form are just too cute. His poetry magic is very fitting for his character, and his confession scene is adorable. The way that Avery gives him courage is very touching and his character development leading up to the fight with Nacht is fantastic. I love it.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Reese[/b]\nReese is a typical wannabe cool guy who acts tough on Avery. He swans about like he's in charge which works surprisingly well with the workplace dynamic between the characters. But, he's a sweetheart underneath his overconfident demeanor. Reese is the assistant manager of A Cat's Paw and is always up to date with fashion. [spoiler]Reese's character development with his magic is fantastic. The way he is portrayed to have been extremely committed to being a witch and yet still having not found his true magic is both heartwrenching and fascinating - Reese failing at magic until he realises he doesn't need to live in his father's shadow is great character development, and his real magic is quite interesting. Also, his cat form seems very fitting for him; even Avery comments on this. Of course, the dynamic of the Nacht scene changes in Reese's route since he's one of the most essential parts of this scene. I'd love to know more about Nacht's relationship with Reese's father, or just more about Reese's father on the whole.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Finley[/b]\nFINLEY. Wow. Okay. So, I played Finley's route last out of Avery's five work mates. Why? Because I didn't like her. In a lot of cases she's nosy, over the top and obnoxious. But when I played her route, she became my favourite character. She's fantastic.\nSo, as you can see from the very start of the game, Finley is quite the meme queen. She's the fashionable girl in charge of social media for A Cat's Paw. She's bubbly and fun to be around, even if she does meddle in other people's business. [spoiler]Her being Jelly Donut is actually strangely fitting for her character, as is her cat form being a calico. It just seems to work well with her bubbly disposition. Whilst her memery was part of the reason why she quickly became my favourite during her route, the main cause of this was her magic. Two words: Hashtag Magic. Absolutely amazing. I couldn't stop smiling throughout the rest of the route after I'd seen Finley in action. Her ending scene is also incredible. I'm actually glad I saved her 'til last. I adore her.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Graves[/b]\nThe boss himself. An old-style-gothic gentleman who looks a little bit like a vampire. He's quite estranged and seems like a hard person to figure out. He's quite full of bravado and the fact that he quotes people like Poe just makes him a great character. His own cat, Dracula, is a nice addition to the story too. [spoiler]Graves' route kept me on the edge of my seat. Between the adorable romance and all of the revelations, this really was the true ending to trump all true endings. I loved every second of it. The balance of comedy and tragedy was just right; the scene where Graves is infected with rust just breaks my heart. It's easy to fall in love with Graves through Avery's eyes whilst playing this route. I loved finally getting to know him and letting things come full circle.[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler][b]Nacht[/b]\nNacht is an excellent villain. in every route he actually feels formidable and threatening. Also, I love his rust power. I love his style, I love the fact that his weapon is a metal bat. It all just seems to mesh together so well, especially with his cocky yet ominous personality. There is a certain level of vagueness with his parting words in the true ending, but honestly it's not hard to read between the lines on that one.[/spoiler]\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend Hustle Cat to fans of visual novels. All I'd say it's missing is an unanswered, \"food for thought\" question that a lot of high quality visual novels have, but honestly the story is so good that it doesn't really need it. There are a few mysteries to work out, though.", "timestamp_created": 1483129253, "timestamp_updated": 1483129253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28841341": {"recommendationid": "28841341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097856581", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483072381}, "language": "english", "review": "I purchased this game after I had already watched some of the routes on Dodger's and Octopimp's playthrough of the game, so I already kinda knew what this game was about. And while normally that would ruin the gmae for some or make it far less enjoyable, this game was still super fun to play. \n\nNow I have a played a lot of otome games (serriously like those companies have way too much of my money), so I'm not going to say that this game is particulary revolutionary in the visual novel genre. However, I does have some diffenreces that I thought made the whole experience much more enjoyable to the player. The first major distinction that I noticed was that there are no \"good\", \"normal\", or \"bad\" ends for each path. After you achive reaching your love interests route in the beginning, you no longer have to make any choices on what you should say or do in a certain situtation. The game simply plays out just like you were reading a book. Thus it leaves the player with only one ending to the path, which is always a good one. Some may agrue that this aspect delibertyly removes player interaction and thus makes the whole experience much more boring. And while I agree that it does infact place the player in more of an observiotory role, it is actually an improvement. One of the things that stresses me out the most when playing a route is whether or not I am going to get that \"good\" ending. \"Should I say this?\" \"Is this the right thing to do?\" \"Does this read as sarcastic or is this going to screw me over in the long run?\" Eventually I just have to break down and look at a walkthrough to make sure I don't royally screw up. Then there is extra added effort of having to play through the exact same story line again with only a few small changes to the dialouge because you chose to wear red to the party instead of blue or some other bull crap like that. And for what? A few extra CGs? By eliminating that option it gets rid of all that stress and allows the palyer to stay fully emersed in the game and just enjoy watching what happens. \n\nThe second distinction that I saw in the game is that some of characters weren't so tropey. I say SOME because of certain characters (looking at you Landry and Finnely). As many experience dating sim players would know, there are six, maybe seven personality types that get reused over and over and over agian in games to point to where you can resonably preict how a certain characters path is going to end before ever playing the route. But with characters like Reese and Mason, the player is left intrested and guessing. Reese is a little brat and remains that way until the end, but there are unexpected sad moments and embarassments and other things that would normally seem outside of his character troupe (at least from what games I have played). And as for Mason, she isn't the normal strong woman type. She ofcourse remains completely stoic while also remaining completely femine. Sure she isn't the standard definiton of girly girly, but there are some sweet moments with Mason in where her feminie charm really does shine. These vartions are really enjoyable and keeps the characters fresh for players who frenquetly purchase titles in this genre. \n\nFinally I would say that MC is not annoying! Like serriously so many games these days make MC's that are either stupid or annoying or both. But Avery Gray is super intresting with a personality of his/her/their own. Avery is nerdy. Avery is lazy. Avery has no understanding of what the word clean is. And best of all, Avery is a huge dork. All of these qualities make Avery Gray feel like an actual person and somebody that you could relate to. Even if Avery's personality isn't your own, you can probably think of somebody you know who behaves like this. He/she/they aren't some bland, boring, cardboard like personality meant to be be so generic that any player can relate to but not really because nobody actually acts like this. So having Avery being a real person is highly refreshing and much more entertaing. \n\nOverall, I would highly recomend a play through of this game. you won't regret it.", "timestamp_created": 1483127868, "timestamp_updated": 1483127868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28821040": {"recommendationid": "28821040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035932545", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482738702}, "language": "english", "review": "In short, this game is really cute, the characters are fun and there's enough choices to keep it interesting without being overwhelming.

I enjoyed every bit of it!!\n\n- Incredible art -- It's very pretty, the only issue I had was that all the ending CGs were only views of the character's backs...? It would have been nice to see more variety in poses for the ending CGs... But otherwise I'm not complaining since we get to kiss everyone heh\n\n\nCould be improved:\n\n- Skipping. I was initially confused by the skipping feature because... It's slow. I thought maybe it was an \"auto\" button instead but it felt a bit too fast to be that either. The skipping feature also made it hard to tell when you encounter new/unread text because it's only a tad slower than the skipping speed. It would be nice if the skipping is faster and skips over sprite transitions, but stops immediately upon encountering new text. Just my advice?\n\n- Personal opinion but I felt the romance feels a bit rushed. Then again I don't think Avery has spent enogh time at the cafe within the game to develop the romance more? Or it could be because after skipping through most of the common route I slowly stopped feeling as much for the characters...\n--\n\nI finished the game in about 9 hours apparently? And that's including (long) toilet breaks. Honestly speaking I wouldn't have paid $20 but now that it's on sale it's definitely worth grabbing!!

I absolutely adore this game. That being said, if you are interested in buying it, there are two things you need to consider. First of all, it's short. When you look at my playtime (add 1 or 2 hours for offline), you should know, that it took me that little to finish the WHOLE game (all six routes). Another thing is that decisions have very slight impact on the game, they are pretty much limited to choosing the character you will end up with. And while each route presents new scenes with your \"chosen one\", the overall storyline remains the same, no matter who will you pick. I write about it here, because even though, usually, I considered things like that a flaw, that didn't bother me at all with this game.\n\n\n[h1]Great things:[/h1]\n\n[b]Plot.[/b] It's light-hearted for the most part, but besides humor and warm atmosphere, it has intrigue, danger, it has stakes, it has tension and mystery, so everything you could expect from a game like this. Plus, writing is great.\n\n[b]Protagonist.[/b] Avery (name, for same reason, isn't changeable) is very relatable protagonist. They are adorably awkward at times, sweet, caring and smart. Also, I like how you can chose your pronounces (He/She/They). I think more visual novels should implement system like this, to give their players flexibility when it comes to romance options.\n\n[b]Characters.[/b] They look different from each other and they behave in a different way. They are not cliche and each of them has an interesting story. I liked every single one pursuable character. Graves and Mason are definietely my favorite. If I would have to pick my least favorite, that would be Finley - I like her as a character, but her route felt waaaay over the top and I didn't enjoy her ending. Still, all routes are worth exploring.\n\n[b]The feels.[/b] I'm not very sentimental person. I don't cry on \"Titanic\" and I don't really care about \"The Notebook\" and other tear-squezers, so when game is able to make me tear up a bit, that game does something right. \n\n[b]Maaaagic![/b] I love the fact, that this game doesn't take itself completely seriously and, with full awareness, often reminds players that \"magic is weird, huh!\". At the same time, I really appreciate those little details, that are thrown on various routes and explain more about how magic work in this game-world.\n\n[b]CATS.[/b]\n\n[h1]Bad things:[/h1]\n\n[b]Skipping.[/b] Dear God. Scrolling? Seriously? It still takes way too long and you can skip over seen text, which is annoying. There is also a skip button. That skips everything so slowly, that you can literally step away from your computer and make yourself something to drink. Oh, but when you come back, you may also realize, it skipped over not-seen text. This is a basic function for visual novel these days, so it's almost baffling to see how bad it was implemented.\n\n[b]Lack of options.[/b] Option menu has like four functions. No speed regulation, no skipping options, nothing of importance to someone, who doesn't want to regulate music.\n\n[b]Technical difficulties.[/b] First of all, there are moments, when you need to click several times before the dialogue moves on (and I'm not talking about those moments, where dialogue is still added to the same box). Then, saving either goes smoothly and takes a second or the game will freeze for a good few minutes. At one of those time, I needed to Ctrl+F4 my way out of it and restart my laptop soon after, because game was still running at the background and slowed everything so much, that I was unable to close it even via Process Monitor. Then, if that wasn't enough, there are issues with achievements. I needed to go through one scene like four times before Steam registered that I actually did what I suppose to do.\n\n[b]Character's \"customization\".[/b] It may seem unreasonable to complain about optional feature, but I feel like there is a reason to do it in that case. When you start the game, you can chose between two very similar avatars. Both are rather boy-ish looking, both have white hair and the same eye color. The only variations comes from skin colors. Picking between how my character looks did absolutely nothing to make the game more enjoyable or immersive. I would much rather have an option to change my character's name (it's very strange that this wasn't implemented), than having this slight, barely noticeable difference between protagonist's look. I'm bringing this up, because I feel like this had an impact on price. And that lead me to the next point.\n\n[b]Price.[/b] When I truly enjoy something, I usually try to avoid judging price as \"too high\", but in this case, it would be hard to avoid and dishonest. I like this game a lot, but my playtime, technical difficulties, similarities between the routes and general lack of content (especially when I compare this game to other visual novels in the same price-range), makes it hard to justify selling \"Hustle Cat\" for 20\u20ac. I've picked it up for half the price and I recommend you to do the same, if you don't want to feel disappointed.\n\n[h1]Conclusion.[/h1]\n\n\"Hustle Cat\" is one of the bast \"dating\" visual novels currently available on Steam. It has options for all genders and sexual preferences, it has great story, solid writing and absolutely adorable characters, that will stay in my memories for long. I will probably replay this game at some point and, as someone with a huge backlog, that is not something I declare lightly. I really hope that developers will create something equally magical in the future (just with better engine).", "timestamp_created": 1482827949, "timestamp_updated": 1482859807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.767536", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28699054": {"recommendationid": "28699054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299838230", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502598532}, "language": "english", "review": "I couldn't stop playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1482814434, "timestamp_updated": 1482814434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28697425": {"recommendationid": "28697425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001910961", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483148881}, "language": "english", "review": "Hustle cat is such a great well written game!  The story is better than I expect from most Otomes, the characters were varied and believable.  Each romancable option have their own plot, while there is an overlying plot that is there through all the characters.  Once you've completed all of them, it unlocks a final character whose story ties up the larger overlying plot.  I haven't finished yet but so far I'm very happy with it!  I've had otome games where I just push myself to complete characters I don't care for just for completionism's sake, but with this I'm excited to read and experience every character's story.\n\nThe main character, Avery, is slightly customizable with their appearance (Skin color can change, and you can choose between short or long hair) and you can designate pronouns.  It's nice, and I appreciate having a gender neutral character. Due to this design decision, Avery is going to feel pretty gender neutral regardless of your appearance or pronoun decisions.  I don't know if I'm phrasing this right, but you don't get to choose between playing as a guy or a girl or a gender neutral character, you just play as Avery, and get to choose their pronouns.  I bring this up because personally I like playing as a girl, but I don't really view Avery as a girl, or as a guy, regardless of what pronouns I give them.  That being said, I really did enjoy Avery's character, and they're one of my favorite main characters from a dating sim!\n\nWhat I really REALLY appreciate SO MUCH from this game is honestly just being able to date guys or girls! I just! Don't get that from many games and I really enjoyed it!\n\nMy only downside for this game is that the actual  mechanics could be improved.

Youre Avery Grey, a fuckin nerd who lives in their aunt\u2019s house. You find a cat cafe with a HELP WANTED sign in the window and decide to stop in, immediately getting the job.

Its up to you as Avery to find out why, and to break this curse over you and your co-workers. My favorite route was Mason\u2019s, as she is waifu stronk and bae. and all those other dank maymay words for saying you really like someone\u2019s character. Im a sucker for stories where you help someone break out of a shell, and her\u2019s is really good considering she throws fridges at people.\n\nThe game does have some flaws, with the third act being incredibly predictable (big bad shows up, Avery cant do it, waifu/husbando shows up and scrungises him), and some very wooden characters (lookin right in your direction Landry), but the positives in the game outweigh the negatives.

I'm still into it. I've replayed my favorite routes, watched Dodger and Octo's LP, and blatantly harassed friends to get the game too. I just love this game.\n\nAvery is hilariously relatable to any person remotely in the same age range, and has a remarkably clear character voice that consistently makes the entire story more fun. And it's already fun to start! Your coworkers who Are Also Cats are all unique personalities that are highly romancable and generally endearing even as supporting characters in other routes. And of course, the option to choose your pronouns and character appearance is absolutely fantastic and incredibly conscientious of the developers, as is the opportunity to romance whomever you like without being restricted by your gender choices or theirs.\nI don't think I can overstate how much I love this game.\n\nMy biggest complaint is only another point in its favor: I want more! The various character endings do feel a bit rushed after the length of buildup in the shared storyline, but really I'm just desperate for DLC. Please.

I thought I'd only care about dating the boys, but the girls won me over too, haha! It's rather simple, not a deep or convoluted story to the extent that, say, a Japanese visual novel would be, but I got many hours of entertaining reading out of it. The art is mostly pretty, though sometimes proportions go wonky or the image is inconsistent with the text if you're picky about details and notice that kind of thing. Some CGs feel like they were drawn with a lot more care than others, too.\n\nMy only real complaint is that after you make it through the choices at the beginning to lock in a character's route, there are almost no more choices for the rest of the game (at least as far as your relationship with said character). You can't \"bad end\" by failing to properly support your choice in romance or anything like that. Once you have your partner, it's all just reading material until the story finale. I like the sense of accomplishment that comes from successfully navigating a VN to its good ends so this was a disappointment for me, but it's just a small blemish on an otherwise pleasant experience.\n\nWish Avery was a bit older, or didn't have a canon age, but that's only because of Graves' route.\n\nI played in the order of Finley > Mason > Reese > Hayes > Landry > Graves and found this to be surprisingly ideal in terms of revealing deeper layers to the story and worldbuilding. This appears to match up with how easy each character was to 'lock in', as they are not equal opportunity in giving you chances to appeal to one character over the others.

Over and over again....  The plot turns super serious kind of abruptly, which made it feel all sudden and scary (in a good, immersive way) and made it even harder to turn off. \n\n The writing is great, very engaging and often laugh-out-loud funny. Important, since Hustle Cat is more like reading a book than playing a game. Which is also great as far as i'm concerned. The art is nice, and has just the right mix of stylized and realistic aspects for the tone of the game.  The characters are interesting, well rounded, and distinctly individual. The game does a great job of immersing you in the community of A Cat's Paw.  And the cats are cute. Since presumably you like cute cats if you want to play this game... A thoroughly enjoyable game. i can't say much more about what i liked without massive spoilers. \n\ni don't think i would really describe this as a dating sim however, since you don't get a ton of choices that affect your relationship. The relationship path you are on dictates most of that and there doesn't seem to be a way to change paths after you start down one. i didn't mind too much.  \n\nIn the interest of balance, things that were less great: \ni wish the game lasted longer. Granted i am a very fast reader, but it took me less than 3 hours to complete. There were some \"and then time passed\" parts that i feel like could have been fleshed out with more interactions and dialogue, even if it was just mundane working-at-a-cat-cafe and getting-to-know-your-coworkers stuff. Replay value seems high, though. \nThere is a bit of railroading, and the way you answer a couple questions very early in the game (before you even know what's going on) have a profound effect on the plot that you get to follow, and there does not seem to be a way to change your path once you are on it. This is sort of a mixed thing... a bit frusterating, but i think it will improve the replay value. \nMost (like 95%) of the music is great, but there were some auto-tuney parts that made my ears sad. i don't like high pitched music though, so it might be fine for most people. \nMINOR SPOILER!\nBreaking the curse happens too suddenly, and without enough explination of what is happening, at least in the first path i followed (Landry). It felt a little anti-climactic, though it isn't the end of the game. \nSPOILER OVER!\n\nIn summary: This game is not perfect (few are), but i really enjoyed it and would reccommend it without hesitation to anyone interested in visual novel type games. And cats. It definitely lived up to my hopes/expectations for it.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1477699719, "timestamp_updated": 1477699719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26123216": {"recommendationid": "26123216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064662970", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478043811}, "language": "english", "review": "Hustle Cat is one of the best dating sims I've ever played, and I have played quite a bit in my time. What makes this one stand out especially is the main character (The character you play as), Avery Grey. Although you can't choose a name for them, you can have the choice of being called he, her, or them. That type of thing is always a breath of fresh air for someone like myself who constantly goes between female or other. Another positive thing about Avery is that he/her/they are not and idiot! Most dating sims have characters who always seem to lack common sense or are pushovers, not Avery. There were very few times where you were left thinking that the main character was an oblivious dumbass. \nNext, the dating characters. There are no genderless dating options, but you can pick between either boys or girls. There is some speculations on at least one of them being trans, but that's not at all mentioned in the game, so don't get your hopes up. There is a wide variety of personalities and physical features, so no one looking for a hot computer date will feel left out. They are all also super cute.\nOverall, this game kept me guessing.

Perhaps I will feel differently after I complete all the routes but I am not so sure. This is due to two issues: there is a great amount of overlap during the first half of the game and during the second half your ability to make choices dramatically decreases. I think that on Finley's I only had one chance to engage with the story once I had her attention. I think that some voice acting would have inclined me towards more of an acceptance of the asking price. \n\nThe plot is definitely fun. Again, I won't know all of it until I do the final unlockable path. However, I think it's fair to assume that it will not be built on much further. This is disappointing as while there is a fair story duration for your first jaunt, much of it will be taken up by that repeated text I mentioned. The skip function isn't as fast as I would have hoped for and there's not an option to only skip what you've already read. I'd love to see a second title involving the same background, only with a less lengthy \"introduction\" phase.\n\nA part of [i]Hustle Cat[/i] I really despise is the music. It's repetitive and, for me, highly distracting. I can't read with it on. Without the BGM, the game is mostly quiet. It would have been nice to enjoy ambient noises and perhaps increased sound effects. \n\nI found the art to be both amusing and cute. Special full-screen moments diverging from the usual backgrounds were a treat. \n\nBeing able to chose your preferred pronouns is refreshing. You have the choice of three feminine avatars with varying skin tones and three masculine ones. They're still fairly androgynous. Your customisation may be quite limited aesthetically but it is still a welcome touch. \n\nIt's possible that I might have more to add later, I'm not sure. I [i]did[/i] enjoy the game but I'm not sure I'm particularly drawn to replay it any time soon, having attempted to do so after completing my first route. \n\nEither way, I laughed and I smiled. That's got to count for something.\n\n[Conclusion:] A great deal of potential which may not have been completely realised and perhaps a little overpriced in comparison to other titles of the same quality here on Steam. If you're a visual novel or dating sim addict like myself you will probably enjoy the experience. I imagine you'll enjoy it best if you catch it on discount/in a bundle, or you receive it as a gift.", "timestamp_created": 1472175632, "timestamp_updated": 1472175657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510284", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25027945": {"recommendationid": "25027945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025079799", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471679959}, "language": "english", "review": "A simple and cute game that suffers from a huge route overlap.

Do you like cats? Well then, you're in luck!\n\n\"Hustle Cat\", by the studio Date Nighto (AKA \"They made 'We Know The Devil'\") is a fluffy, adorable game for those who love cats, lovable characters, fun humor, and some pure, innocent romance. The player takes control of Avery Gray (pronouns, gender presentation and skin tone choosable by the player), a twenty-something who finds out that a nearby cat cafe needs employees. They love cats. They also need a job. Seems like a match made in heaven, right?\n\nWell, let's just say that Avery, along with the other characters, get a bit more than they bargained for.\n\nThis is the kind of game where it's good to go in with a fresh slate, so I won't go into too much detail, but it's a delight. Honestly, even if the story can seem contrived at points (it's explained in the special route, don't worry, though I wish they explained a VERY IMPORTANT PLOT POINT a bit more overall), that's a small complaint, since it's so goshdang adorable. That, and the characters really carry the game. Hayes', Landry's, and Mason's routes ended up being my favorites.\n\nAvery, the protagonist, is phenomenal. They're a believable young adult/late teen (they're 19) and most of their internal monologue matched what I was thinking as I played. On that note, everyone's dialog is wonderful. Whether it's being self-referential, humorous, or poignant at points, it's a joy to read. It's clearly a labor of love on the part of Date Nighto, and this love shows in every moment.\n\nThe CGs are also wonderful! I love the art style, which is somewhere between anime and American cartoons. The skin-color changing option for Avery, along with the alternate gender presentations and pronouns, are also a nice touch, and alternate forms of Avery in each cut scene can be accessed via the CG gallery. It's fun to tinker around and see what the scenes look like for other players!\n\nAlso, unlike some other dating sims on Steam, this one is entirely family-friendly, save for some language. There are a few \"mature\" themes underlying some of the routes, but they are presented in a way that is suitable for any player, no matter of age. I, as someone who lives for fluffy cuteness, was pleasantly surprised, especially after playing darker dating sims like \"Nameless: The One Thing You Must Recall\" and \"Hatoful Boyfriend\".\n\nMy few complaints are that sometimes, the game wouldn't save CGs, so I had to play routes a few times to get them. The game would sometimes crash on me randomly. The Steam overlay doesn't work properly. That, and the storyline can get a bit repetitive within each route, since there's a general story point you have to reach in each for the sake of concluding the plot overall.\n\nBut, these are all small complaints. This game ended up warming my heart like a nice cup of tea. While it's not perfect, I'd say it's definitely worth the buy, as it's an adorable, well-made gem.\n\nSo, overall, visit A Cat's Paw and treat yourself to some purr-fectly sweet fun.

Your personality is the same no matter what gender identity you choose, and as a romance choice you might have a 'tough' girl who's all about pretty rocks & making sure you eat a proper meal, or you might have a jerky 'bro'-like guy who also likes romance novels. No chars have a problem cuddling and being affectionate. The cute girly girl is also a fucking game nerd.[/*]\n[*]So, so funny. I couldn't stop laughing. I love how real the chars are. \"RUDE.\"[/*]\n[*]No stat management!!![/*]\n[*]The choices you make in the beginning set you on your route but once you're on a route you don't have to worry about lots of other choices to screw up[/*]\n[*]It's representative (uses your choice of m, f, or non-binary pronouns, and there are different skin tones). It could use body-size representation, but it's still adorable as heck.[/*]\n[*]All m or f relationships are open to every pronoun choice[/*]\n[*]THE SECRET ROUTE. Holy shit the secret route.

For 20 dollars, this game is not worth THIS much formula, THIS SHORT of a game with the same plot regardless of what you do - especially when you realize you can buy Hatoful Boyfriend for half the price and get a Dating Sim AND a murder-mystery/science fiction plot, or, you can play free polished games like Katowa Shoujo, an 18+ Dating Sim that has anime-level cutscenes. And it's free.\n\nBut this alone wouldn't make me  not reccomend this game - if this was it, I'd say 'get it when it's on sale.\nWhat kills this game are its bugs.\n\nAs of my writing of this, I can't unlock the final \"secret\" route. The game doesn't remember I've dated everyone, even though I've played through all routes at least three times. Look at my time, those 10 hours are me skipping through everything as fast as possible hoping that the game will REMEMBER that I've dated everyone, but it won't. This game forgets routes if you crash, if you don't crash, if you save a lot, if you don't save - there's no rhyme or reason to this game's memory leak.\n\nI posted on the discussion forums, I e-mailed the game's support - I got NO response. This game's lack of support, on top of its inability to do basic dating sim functions, on top of its price leads me highly disappointed.

I've pretty much gone through all the main playthroughs and I've enjoyed every route. \n\nPros:\n+ Characters are three dimensional with quirks and flaws and are all interesting in their own unique way.\n+ The MC is enjoyable and fairly relatable\n+ The art is great\n+ The story is fun, funny, and just overall enjoyable\n+ The music is outstanding\n+ Like with most VN's, the overall plot comes together as you play through the routes. This is executed well.\n+ Having a gender neutral option was great. It's never questioned or made a big deal.\n\nCons:\n\nAll of my cons are program based. The game has crased on me twice since playing, and during those it (at the moment this was written) no longer registers two of my playthroughs, which is a problem for later. Fast forwarding can also cause the program to crash, so I strongly suggest for players to save often. However, these cons really aren't deal breakers compared to all the pros you get.\n\nCompared to large commercial games like Hakuoki or Amnesia this isn't long, but for an indie game I feel it's definitely worth it.\n\n\nSide note: I saw one negative review that mentioned grammar errors and...???? I saw maybe two through all 4 playthroughs so I don't know what they're talking about.

Its the perfect mix between cutesy and badass! Im constantly going through the gallery because I just enjoy looking at the style despite it being real simple. Then theres the music! The music is pleasant to listen to and I never felt like it was in the wrong place. It made each scene that much more emotional and I found that I would stop to listen to it evey once in a while. \n\nNow the story and characters are super unique and im always interested even if I have played the game over and over. It leaves you starving for more of the plot and its really one of the reasons I played the game as much as I did. The characters are the other reason. Its really easy to fall in love with each character. Each one gets their own unique story line with each ending a little diffrent depending on who you chose. You really connect with them though I little more than others. I personally enjoyed Masons route, Shes fucking adorable and im straight and everything! Like thats just how much I fell in love with these characters! \n\nJust in conclusion this game is really well done. Its not like other dating sims/visual novels.

I like the art style and the fact you can romance any of the characters regards of your choices on the character select screen. \n\nI thought each of the story arcs was interesting. Each person has their own backstory and their own personality that affects how they interact with Avery. It didn't feel cookie-cutter to me like other dating sims.

While these scenes were displayed reasonably differently to the point it felt like it was distinctly that character's.\n\nAnd really my only other regret is there wasn't more written....

Honestly, it looked a little amature and I went into it expecting near crap- like most lesser-known visual novels/otome games on Steam tend to be. What I got was the exact opposite. The main character, Avery, and all of the cast are unique and likable. Avery's narration is relatable and I chuckled quite a lot at some lines. The magic mythos touched upon is interesting and left me wanting to know more. Doing all routes clocked out at around 17 hours for me, which is fanatastic considering this was an independently developed game. The art, while not the best (which can be an issue for some considereing visual novels, are, well, VISUAL) is charming and colorful. The backgrounds are very nice, more so than the character portraits. The abilities to choose your perfered pronouns and have some variety in apperence are also a big plus. \n\nMy only complaints about Hustle Cat come down to a lack of variety- which I know is strange, considering what I just said. The music got annoyingly repetative (two songs in perticular were played way too much during upbeat and relaxing moments that made them anything but). All the routes boiled down to the exact same big conflict at the end, with the exact same antagonist. The only thing different about each route is how he is taken down, but all of them end up being  essencially the same conflict. Worse yet, said main antagonist is given no development in any of the main routes- he is only given any sort of meaningful explaination for his actions AT ALL in the unlockable route, a trend in otome games that really bothers me. He was the driving overarching threat in EVERY ROUTE! It cheapens the impact of the original routes if all important story and weight is placed in the extra route. It would have been better if the antagonist of every route was more tailored to the chosen LI somehow. It made playing routes get very samey very fast when I knew what was coming.\n\nOverall however, this is still worth checking out, if only to support the developer in hopes they build upon what they did right in this game and make more. If you're more of a casual otome fan, this is just for you. If you want something with  more meat, I'd reccomend Ozmafia!!

To be fair, the ending scene was good for each character, but I would have loved the routes to have very different endings. Or even having multiple possible endings per character.\n\nFelt like there were a few loopholes or unknowns left over: The characterization was very good but I think the setting needed more material.

At least my friends and I had fun? \n\n\nand that's it.\n\nAs for the cons, I don't know where to start. \n\nCons:\n\nThe game was very inconsistent throughout, no matter what route you played. The character dialogues were really off. It takes them a while to notice something completely obvious. Repetition is usually key when memorizing things, but it doesn't do well in a visual novel. it makes the audience feel stupid...like Avery. The artwork was inconsistent, and very sloppy. The perspective was off in just about every background. The anatomy is really strange. The necks were too long; in particular, their collarbones were too low. The arms and hands were oddly positioned. It works for CLAMP, if that's what the creators were going for (however, this can't be compared to CLAMP because at least they're consistent with their artwork). There were so many grammatical errors (my friend who is an English major even cried), it was clear that the game did not have an editor. There were a lot of spelling errors too, and they should really check all of these things before publicizing the game. The fast forward option is nice, but it would have been nicer if they had varying levels of speed. The game was pretty laggy on more than a dozen occasions. The user interface was simple, which was okay, but it feels like the creators tried to make it too simple. The \"menu\" button looked more like a replay/loop button, and I didn't know it until I clicked on it.  No real effort seemed to go into it. Not only that, the color scheme of the interface was atrocious. I'm not an art major, but I know that the colors chosen for the game did not go well together. Speaking of colors, they felt too flat in the game. The shading was really sloppy and so was the line art. Plot wise...well there seemed to be too many things missing from the plot; this confuses the audience. A lot of the information wasn't really given in game. I had to look on tumblr in order to make sense of the game. Not only that, the ending was anticlimactic because the main antagonist simply disappears with his tail between his legs. There was no real struggle between the protagonist and antagonist. Character development in each route seemed too fast paced. It didn't really feel like you got to know the characters before you went into their routes. Too many internet tropes were used. I understood some, but honestly, not everyone will understand them, and it will only leave them confused...like Avery in most of the game. Honestly though, nothing was a surprise in the game because the final climactic CG was part of the opening. Also, the opening was very heavy on auto tune, unless you enjoy that sort of thing. The background music was okay, though I had it muted most of the time. The slider for the music wasn't as smooth. Just one click and the music was pretty loud.\n\nDating cats was such an interesting concept and had so much potential. Choosing your pronouns and skin colors was pretty cool. However, that doesn't make up for my long list of cons. In all, this game wasn't worth the $20 I spent. The routes were pretty short and not well written. It was a good attempt at an indie game, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. I don't recommend this game to anyone. My advice is to just save your money and fund Ono Kensho instead. if you're still interested in the game though, just watch Let's Play videos.

And one might argue that maybe there's more to this than the usual \"dating sim\" part of a Visual Novel, but even the underlying storyline, and the cat cafe parts, don't really take up much more focus either. I just really would have liked more cute cat moments and boy/girlfriend moments, and cat boy/girlfriend moments.

Though the possible gay choices and little character customization somewhat make up for that, I suppose. It's all certainly nice to look at, and you'll have more than your fill of cute scenes to gawk at.

I do not await their release with anticipation, but when an interesting one comes out I will often times nab it and poke my nose in, and once I heard the premise for Hustle Cat I was sold in a heartbeat, but this is a review, so...is it good? yes, yes I think it's good, but not tooooo far above average.\n\nIf you want my tl;dr opinion it's about a 6/10. Good but coulda been a lot better, now for details\n\nI'll start by saying I have not 100% played through this game. I played through one storyline route, the Finley route, and hooooo boy.....that was a mistake. Her storyline is pretty preachy at a little over the halfway point, and it's really on the nose with what it's about, and there's some stuff that just made me wince in the writing. I wont spoil it, but, you'll know exactly what i'm talking about.\n\nI actually pushed for the Finley storyline at first. When I learned that you could select your gender pronouns at the beginning, I was hopeful that one of the love interests might be trans. I'm a trans woman myself, so it would have been a nice little relatable thing to see in game, and yes...I suspected that Finley was trans at the beginning, which is why I steered things down that path. However, nope, it turns out Finley is a soapbox to push some devs views, and it really shows. I wont dance around it. this partanes to SJW/anti-SJW situations. I don't care what your views are on that stuff, I find myself in the middle a lot of the time, but jesus hustle cat, your strawmanning was hardcore, and that's what bothered me. It was a poorly writen scene overall, and felt like it was only there to make a statement and empower Finley, who didn't really need it anyway. \n\nNow that the cat's out of the bag *eyebrow bounces* Let me get to the pros that make this shine!\n-The writing! When it's not preaching to you is great! I laughed a few times, I smiled many more, and I liked all of the characters for the most part\n-The art! The cats are all adorable, except that grump Mochi, and I never once felt disatisfied with the pace of art transitions like some games I could mention *Cough* Sakura Spirit *Cough*\n-The Choices! Holy moley thank you hustle cat for having choices. I like visual novels, but when there's literally only one or two choices *Cough* Sakura *Cough cough* Freaken....*Cough* Spirit *Cough* it takes me out of it because I may as well be reading a book. \n-The Length! Given that you're expected to play through multiple times for the different paths, I think this is a nice length. However, the ending does feel kind of abrupt, and this setting begs for a sequel.\n\nIt is a visual novel so there's not any gameplay to critique so I think that about sums it up! Though, I was not able to get the steam overlay to function with it. That may need to be looked at, or it could be a bug on my end. \n\nAll in all, I recommend it. It has about as much cheese as one expects from a visual novel, and save for my gripe about it feeling soapboxy at a couple points, I felt it was a really solid visual novel and I will be playing again, this time going after either Mason or Hayes.

You get 6 character routes! 2 ladies and 4 fellas. Some of them are PoC (another ++ for me because representation is important! :D ) And you can romance any of 'em regardless of the gender you choose. \n\nThe story is really cute and it'll have you squeeing at certain scenes. Planning to upload lots of screenshots when I figure out why I can't take snapshots in game on Steam.\n\nThe music is great. I haven't seen any of the positive reviews mention this but its like really good elevator music. Like if an elevator was playing some of the tracks that I was listening to in Hustle Cat I'd probably stay on that elevator a little longer d: Like I had hustle cat playing on certain scenes for certain tracks while I was just doing stuff on my computer lolol.\n\nSome complaints I'd probably have is how I can't delete saves lol. Like there are so few complaints that I have about hustle cat and majority of them are just glitches like eyes/nose missing from faces and it happens just a few times but it doesn't really take away from how awesome it is. But there are things on Steam that I've noticed happens frequently like when I fast forward on hustle cat it crashes. But again other than all these really small things it really doesn't take away from a great story and characters that you can't help but adore.\n\nOver-all no regrets. You get 6 character routes which is about 15 hours of play time(20+ for me because I just couldn't stop replaying Mason's story before moving on) for a really cute and good story with really great music and really, really adorable characters that aren't perfect which make them perfect. Like I can name one trait(besides all of them being super adorable) that really shine in each of the characters but I think you'd probably wanna figure that out yourself.\n\nP.S. there are cats.

It's definitely not for you if you're not a fan of text-heavy games, but you'll be right at home if you're into that stuff, or if you're looking to start!\n\nWith that in mind, Hustle Cat happens to have a WONDERFUL set of characters, a pretty engaging plot, and overall just really, really nice writing! The way characters are written and their dialogue is laid out is done in a way that you really don't see very often in several games, and though I absolutely liked some more than others, there truly weren't any characters I disliked at all.\nAvery, the protagonist, is an easy example of splendid  characterization, and their interactions with the cafe's staff are really fun to read and enjoyable to go through.\n\nI will say there were a couple of routes were things were handled a little bit strangely, and some certainly feel like they received less attention than others, although that tends to be mostly in the pictures department rather than in writing. General favoritism is there, but this isn't to say that the ones that were noticeably better liked by Date Nighto weren't amazing to play through!\n\nIt's easy to catch wind of how to go through each route, and though runs past your first might be a little bit uneventful on your way to taking on another one, the fact you can speed up doesn't really let that drag for too long.\n[spoiler]I do wish that the whole \"cat\" aspect of the game, which is the lead appeal, hadn't been dropped the way it was, though, but that might just be me. I'll give them a TON of praise for using the word \"witch\" as unisex, though! You hardly see people realizing it's unisex in most games these days![/spoiler]\n\nMoving on to the music, I can say it was...all right!\nNothing really stood out to me, and most of the songs began as generic before shifting to repetitive, but I wouldn't say they ever got grating or annoying to listen to, and some were very much perfect for the mood, at times.\n...Big emphasis on \"at times\", though, as there were tons of moments through the game where I felt as though a change in song or maybe a bit of silence would've been much better suited (almost expected) for what the text was carrying the mood through. It definitely took away from some scenes, for me.\n\nNext, we have the art! And boy, Hustle Cat is PRETTY!\nThe character expressions might be a little awkward rarely, but I usually found them to be really nice and fun to look at! The mugshot models themselves are really nicely shaded, with thick lines and great color choices that keep everything vibrant, cute, and just really...alive! Each character gets a very nice and decent selection of expressions as well, which keeps the text accompanying them always engaging!\n\nIf there's anything to complain about, it'd be that certain of the special event pictures tend to have awkward faces or anatomy at times, and then you have some others that just don't have shading at all, which I found really strange. These aren't so many that it'd damage the overall quality, though.\n\nThe interface is kind of generic for what you'd expect of a visual novel, and can be a little plain here and there, but it's definitely not unfitting or clashing with the style. It's cute, simple, and not pretentious or intrusive, so I can't complain at all.\n\nOne thing I absolutely wanna praise is the game's auto save feature! While it's not good advertising to say that the game crashed on me twice, it did happen at times when I was speeding through the dialogue, and my laptop happened to also be running several other things at the time.\nBut, thanks to the auto saving, I really didn't need to worry, since I could just hop back onto where I was just playing last time!\n\n[h1]Overall![/h1]\nHustle Cat is adorable, and whether you're a cat person or a visual novel fan, you'll definitely like it! The cast is full of life and splendidly written dialogue, and even if the story might get a bit awkward at times, it always keeps engaging and fun to go through.\n\nThe music is a little repetitive and uninspired, and tends to clash with the mood or go on for too long sometimes, but it was never grating or annoying to listen to, at least in my opinion.\n\nThe art is gorgeous, with a few hiccups in some special scenes, but never losing charm or failing to bring life to the scene it comes along with. While the game might rely on the still character mugshots a lot, it still has a much more abundant selection of special art than most visual novels out there!\n\nIt's a pretty great game that could've been a lot better, but I can assure you it won't disappoint!\n", "timestamp_created": 1458978548, "timestamp_updated": 1458978548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22050970": {"recommendationid": "22050970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141731548", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458880426}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game alot.

After just playing through one route, I can say I'm in love with it. \n\nYes, these are a few tiny little issues here and there, but there is nothing that takes away from the game play or story. They seem to be things with the game engine or something along those lines? Sometimes the transitions were a bit choppy and I would occasionally get a loading screen when a new scene was loading. The actual text itself were also seem like it was sort of....lagging I guess would be the best term? For some reason it would get better when I switched from using the mouse to hitting enter and whether that was the game itself, my computer, or just a state mind is yet to be seen. Like I said though, nothing that takes away the wonderful story and art this game gives you. \n\nI was expecting at least one of the plot points that happened in this story, but the rest. Wow. Not even close. It never felt like it was forced to me either and I never really found myself kind of disbelieving in how the game got me there. More often then not I found myself muttering under my breath in a good surprise about things that happened. The writing is wonderful and each character shines through with their own unique qualities and characteristics. At this point I have one played through one route and I loved all the characters. What I really love though, is how Avery has a personality as well and it actually shows as you play throughout the game. Where as some VN heroines/heroes come across as completely dumb or useless, Avery never felt that way to me. \n\nThe romance (at least the one route I played) was very natural as well. It was there, it was adorable, it made me smile and laugh, but it wasn't just in your face and then over. At this point I'm definitely looking forward to seeing how that plays out on the other routes in the game. \n\nIf you're interested at all in the game, I would say pick it up when you have the chance.

Going into dating sims, I expect the dialog to be really formulaic, but this one stood out.  I found myself chuckling and leaning forward in my seat with curiosity.  I especially loved the character Graves.  I was motivated to buy this just to pursue him after I saw him in the trailer (mischievous smirking, probably-a-wizard, with two different color eyes?  Yes please!).  Surprisingly, he wound up my second favorite love interest, and I really enjoyed his path!

I bought it on a whim on a bad night and don't entirely regret it. Overall it's a recommendation for me but I do have a few things I want to say about it. Just gonna do a quick list:\n\nPros\n- Pretty dang cute art\n- Being able to choose your gender and romance whoever\n- Interesting story (so far, I haven't seen all the paths)\n- A pretty diverse cast of characters with interesting personalities\n- INCLUDING the main character! So many of these have blank slate main characters. Avery is not that at all.\n- Decent script overall, much better than I expected honestly (it's easy to cash in on the 'weird versions of sim dating' craze, what can I say xD)\n\n\nCons\n- This is the most finicky skip button I have ever seen in one of these games that have a skip button! I wouldn't complain so much about this, but this game REQUIRES you to play all the routes to get the full story. Sometimes it worked fine, othertimes I would have to X out and then in for it to work. \n- Shorter run time may be a turn off at the price (my play time mostly stems from me having it on in the background and coming back to it every once in a while, someone said eight hours elsewhere and that sounds about right. I have no issue with it, but people should be aware.)\n- This one is my biggest gripe: The stories really do feel imcomplete until you realize that you need to see everyone's to get a fuller picture (or at least pick the ones who actively cares more about the magic portion of the plot - Mason, my first pick, did not.) This is the first time I've ever really felt forced to romance people I had no interest in whatsoever to get any idea of the plot, because I prefer to romance female characters and this game appears to be specifically attempting to cater to the LGBTQ audience who want to follow their own preferences.\n- You only have like a page of save files (I think six or eight all together?).

Since that was caught my eye first! All the characters are well designed and pretty drawn. Not much shading on them yet solid and alive. Its very pretty and some pictures just makes you stare in awe.<3 \nBut, the proportions does vary sometimes.. Still, its weigh up by that most of the art is beautiful. \nThe backgrounds are well drawn in detail, design and perspectiv. Yet very grey, it could have more colour to it.\n\nThe characters are all lovely in there own way! And easy to remember, both in design and personality. I like all of them.<3 They are all cute in there ways, and talents, reactions. Audeghjrghr why are they so adorable! It hurts .. in a good way..hum. The head character is also funny xD\n\nThe music is good, I have not so much to say about it. :S But the meny music catch one's attation quick and give a good feel to the game. It fits to the mood, and got my attation time to time ... Although when I do listen, it has a nice rythm and sound. \n\nThe story, its easy to get the route you want with the choices you get first. And each of the routes are cute, and the relationships walks in a good pace, it gives one a sweet feeling of waiting and see them to fall in love <3. Also interesting story to get to know each of the cast. And pretty fail safe, when the route starts, there is only follow the story for the most, which is worth it.<3 To get the whole picture of the story, then you need all the routes and puzzle them up in your mind.(Sort of ) Although .. it leaves one hanging at the end a bit, a curiosty that is not filled up. Perhaps realstic, yet one want to know a bit more.. \n The beginning get tiresome before each route. And yes, the skipe button .. I lost my trust for that one, since it did not always stop at something new. D:\nThere is also one of the ending scenes, that is also off .. You have your choice of partner, and see different scenarios, yet one scene is ''neutral'' ... or how I shall explain it. Its as if the main character has a short memory loss all of a sudden, since its the same lines that is said in each route, and the events before vanish for a second ... \nAs mentioned, to get the whole plot, otherwise it gets a bit ..weird.[spoiler] A evil guy all of a sudden then gone :S And no much explanation. Then the end of the route.[/spoiler]  Even as one played the whole game, could have a bit more explaning, and dig more into the plot. \nPerhaps could showed more of it depths. Still, I like the story though, its enough to keep my interest. :)  \n\nThe text is simple, for the most .. if not Graves is the one speaking xD. Its funny and natural ( if one read out loud, one can feel how the character would say it :D ), but some stuff feeled a bit forced, not often and easy to ignore.   \n\nAlso it random crashes, but luckily it there is autosave, and can just pick up where one left. :D\n\nOne great feature about this game was to ''choose'' a gender! And apperance! Gay/lesbian/hetro/something! They does not actaully react or say much about it in the game though. But it could be BL, and that was enough for me <3. \n\nI recommend this game,  since it hade a good feel into it, and made me smile, both physically and mentally.

Note my time played - 3.5 hours, as of when I'm writing this. Unless some of the men's routes are much longer, which I seriously doubt, I can't imagine getting more than nine hours out of this. MAYBE if you really like rereading VNs. Even then, most VN's I've got through steam are quite a bit longer.[/strike] (I've since finished all routes)\n\n[b]I'm glad I played this game, but in good conscience I cannot recommend a game this short at this price.[/b] It is a VERY, VERY short game, and the price it's at as of my writing this review (17.99 USD) is just totally unreasonable.\n\n[b]ETA:[/b] I've played all six routes now. Total play time 8.1 hours on record (I did kinda blitz through the mens' routes; like I said, I'm gay and biased towards the women). They were all very well written and engaging, with good art and interesting characters. I stand by everything else I've said in this review - including, unfortunately, my non-recommendation.\n\nI can see why it's priced high; it clearly has very high quality art and text and music (particularly considering that there are six versions of Avery's face). But from a consumer standpoint it's really hard to justify.\n\nSo, on to the good.\n\nThe art is excellent, and the writing is great. Mason's route actually had me in tears. Finley is absolutely adorable. The beginning, and some short parts near the end, got a bit repetitive, but overall I liked all the different routes, how you learn different things about the characters etc.\n\nI like the ability to choose the pronouns for Avery, your character, and also independently select your appearance (there's a more 'masculine' and a more 'feminine' face available, and you can choose between three skin tones as well). This is reflected pretty well in the gameplay as well, though there were a couple awkward moments in Finley's route where a side character's dialogue seemed to be making the assumption that Avery was male, and noone corrected him? (The pronouns still fit, it was a broader text issue. Maybe just me.)\n\nAnd some small complaints, other than the length of the game. These don't affect my (non)-recommendation.\n\nThere's no text speed option that I saw, so you kind of have to click your way through each sentence of dialogue at a pretty rapid pace if you read pretty quickly. This can also lead to accidentally clicking past a certain portion of dialogue too early because you were trying to get all the sentences displayed, which leads to another quibble...\n\nMost other VN's I've read/played, you can scroll back at least a bit to see something you might've just missed. Hustle Cat, for some reason, does not. There IS a log, so if you just missed something you can open that and see the recent text, but it's odd that you can't just scroll back a little bit. I assume this is in Ren'Py, which I KNOW can do that.\n\nAlso, this isn't something I'm actually concerned with at all, but I know some people prefer much more interactive VN's. This isn't; in all of the routes, the first third of the game is making some basic decisions about who you get close to, which determines which route you're on; the middle third is non-interactive; and the last third may have one player choice which either immediately leads to a bad end or continues the story to the end.

There are a few niggling issues that might be easily fixed but honestly none of them are major enough to detract from what is an incredibly enjoyable game.[/h1]\n\nHustle Cat is one of the most enjoyable games I have played in a long time. I was immediately attracted to the project; being a cat lover and appreciating its nonbinary options (and Graves having an uncanny resemblance to my husbando) made me back the kickstarter right away.\n\n[u]Some basic info:[/u]\n[*]You can pick your pronouns (She/Her, He/Him, They/Them) and what Avery looks like (you have between masculine presenting and feminine presenting and a range of skin tones) but you cannot change the name. You can change which pronouns you want in the menu, whenever you like.\n[*]You can romance any of the characters regardless of any options you pick, however one character is a secret option. \n[*]One play through lasts about 2.5 hours to 3 hours. Any subsequent ones will take less if you skip. There are 6 routes in total. There are bad ends.\n\n[u]The good stuff:[/u]\n[*]The writing is incredibly enjoyable. It's certainly on the meme-y side of things, but the jokes were great, many had me giggling out loud. A lot of scenes made me cry; but YMMV. The characters are all very likeable and have great chemistry with each other. There are so many scenes I enjoyed, and honestly it was just such a fun experience playing it. \n[*]The routes are fairly flexible. Some visual novels I have played tend to lock you in pretty early and with obvious choices, but with Hustle Cat they have a points system. Don't feel like picking one option will lock you in to that character.\n[*]The art is mostly great. I really like a lot of the sprites, many of the characters have great poses and expressions that really reflect their character. Art is always important in visual novels as it tends to be what people judge the game on, and I think for the most part Hustle Cat does a great job.\n[*]The characters are all great. I was immediately draw to Graves, but then began to love Finley and Mason too. And then Hayes, Landry and Reese\u2026 Unlocking the secret route involves putting time in with everyone, but I don't believe any one of these characters routes was anything less than enjoyable.\n[*]This is an incredibly inclusive game! The fact that you can choose your pronouns and date anyone regardless of gender is incredibly amazing and honestly something that just cannot be faulted, unless you are against anything vaguely 'SJW-like'. The inclusivity is not harming you in any way and you don't have to romance anyone you don't want to; if the games inclusivity bothers you in any way then this just isn't the game for you.\n\n[u]A few issues:[/u]\n[*]The screenshot button and steam overlay do not work. The game is easily tabbed out of, but I found the fact I couldn't take screenshots with steam really quite disappointed. I wanted to share things with friends who had already played the game and had to use a different piece of software to do so.\n[*]This is more or less severe depending on taste, but while I thought the majority of the sprites were good, some of the CG were disappointing. In particular I think of Mason's end CG, which seems to be unshaded and just looks a lot worse compared to the other CG. It almost seems like it was a time issue; the CG simply looks a little unfinished.\n[*]The skip button is okay, but could be better. The transitions still take a while and so spamming space bar is often a bit quicker. \n[*]The story feels a little disjointed in some places, and the pacing is rather quick. At one point Avery started talking about their crush; I had no idea who it was and how it happened! I know that it was because of a choice I made, but it doesn't make much sense if you play it without realizing that you effectively skipped a scene. I suppose this gave some suspense as to who I was actually romancing\u2026 I would've liked it to have been longer so I could spend more time with the characters, but of course I would have expected the price to be more too. In my opinion, this game is good value for money at full price.\n[*]There are so few save files! Having played a fair amount of visual novels I am used to having pages and pages of save files, but I found Hustle Cat a bit lacking.\n\n\nI enjoyed Hustle Cat immensely and am so glad I backed it on kickstarter. Whether you're interested in the plot, the cats, the characters, the inclusivity, or something else, you will find this game enjoyable. Visual novel purists might be turned off by the game's elements that are atypical of the genre, but I believe anyone interested in the premise or any of the game's aspect will find it enjoyable. If in doubt, wait for steam sale, but if you're in any way excited by the game, buy it now.

The protagonist is a solid character, with great internal dialogue that fits for either a male or female character. The gender flexibility allows for personalized character design, even going so far as to offer a singular 'they/them' pronoun along with 'he/him' and 'she/her'. Whatever choice you make, your character will be treated - and loved - equally by any of the characters. \n\nThe most intersting thing about the game is the overarching narrative that takes place with each romance option you play through. While the first five romances follow similar formats, each one will give you just a bit more information on the plot than you had before. And once you've worked through all five, you unlock the - in my personal opinion - best romance. this last story is wonderfully done, weaving together everything you learned from previous playthroughs, while giving you fresh insight and closure on the issue. Also, it's heart-melting.

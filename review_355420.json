We'll start with the graphics, since that's what I first noticed. I like this style in general, but I especialy love how it runs uncapped at *steam's overlay reports* 420 FPS, yet a lot of the motions 'stutter', like the movements of NES games. Paired with the \"420\" fps smooth fire particles, note that this is the title screen, make a contrast I love.\nSecond. The Soundtrack. Given as how I'm on the title screen, I have yet to experience everything currently on offer, but it's already in my favorites, and I will be placing the OST on my phone as soon as I get to.\n\nAnd after playing the first level and getting acquainted with the controls, I can safely say that I enjoy this game and think it's a wonderful spin on the TRPG genre.

The game's core game-play (so far) focuses on the Planning and Execute phase.  \n\nDuring the Planning Phase, you move your characters around the map within the limitations of your characters movement ability in 5 second segments and issue orders to attack based on (typically) 3 different parameters: Auto, Adjusted, and Manual.  Auto involves a zone-of-control where any visible enemy that falls within that radius gets attacked, but enemies take less damage; Adjusted allows you to place a smaller attack radius within a certain distance of your character and attacks any enemy that falls within that radius, for normal damage; Manual has no attack radius and relies on direct contact and inflicts the most damage of the three, but requires being able to predict the enemies location precisely.\n\nOnce you've planned all your character's actions, you can then hit the Execute button to watch it all play out in 5 seconds of real-time.  Rinse-wash-repeat.  It takes a little bit of time to get the hang of it, but the game-play emphasizes predicting your enemies movements and attacks (there is an indicator to tell you which character a specific enemy is targeting) which I do like, but can be a bit easy fighting an enemy one-on-one.  Fortunately, many of the fights involve multiple characters and enemies to juggle and to me, that's where the complexity lies.  \n\nOn paper, you would think it would turn into a \"they're attacking so I defend, ad nauseam\" kind of game-play, but there are things you can do to affect the outcome of battle, like intercepting other enemies and applying an attack or defensive option as they attack a weaker or near-dead character (thereby protecting them), so long as you can get in the way of the enemy.  Because of this, the combat doesn't turn into a simple slug-fest and is very refreshing, forcing you to consider many options, and not just in terms of pure statistics.\n\nGraphic-wise, the game has a really nice pixel-art, 8-bit aesthetic, reminiscent of \"Sword & Sorcery\" (but then again, it could just be the limitations of pixel art games) with beautifully rendered environments and character designs (within the limitations of pixel art, again), with the characters a nice mix of eastern and western influences (it seems).  Throughout the game there are numerous little touches here and there (such as on the world map, how the clouds seem to move and part, revealing some areas of the map) that add to the feel and look of the world and give it a level of ambiance that some games are sorely lacking.\n\nMusic-wise, they have done an incredible job as well, with the style of music bringing me back to the days of Chrono-trigger, Tactics Ogre, and Final Fantasy Tactics, not in the sense of a carbon copy, but one that has the trappings and nostalgia of the era, with a personality all its own.  The tracks are varied, beautiful, appropriate to the mood, and are a key component in providing a sense of wonder (along with the graphics).  They go hand in hand very well.\n\nStory-wise, the game is good, although key elements of the story are not really revealed in the current build of the game (purposely done) and it's understandable since the game isn't complete as of yet.  What exists is definitely intriguing, although it's too early to say whether it's something of a standard fare or something different, or maybe a bit of both.  I'm hoping it strays more from its JRPG roots to give something less standard, but I also appreciate an uncompromising story told by the author,  as long as it is told well.  \n\nI personally love the game so far, although it should be said that this game is far from complete and is being made by an extremely small team (of 2, I believe), so you should consider that if you plan to purchase the game.  I would expect to see infrequent updates due to the time commitments of the two developers, with patience and understanding being a prerequisite when purchasing this game.  \n\nThe reason I bought the game was because I tried the demo and loved it, and the $10 price tag was a small sum to pay for an interesting game like this, with the expectation that, as more content is developed and expanded upon, it will be well worth my time and money in the long run (plus a developer needs to eat), but it isn't without it's caveats.  Balance and design seems to still be in process, so expect things to change for better or worse, depending on your mindset.\n\nI definitely recommend this game, but only if you are prepared to deal with it's long gestation time and the constraints of the developers.  Going into the game like that, it made it much easier for me to accept the 3 hours of game-play that it offers, but if this is a tip of the iceberg, then the rest, once developed, should be a very unique and enjoyable experience.", "timestamp_created": 1490714784, "timestamp_updated": 1490871439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.727804", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30744485": {"recommendationid": "30744485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033986785", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490510900}, "language": "english", "review": "pulls at the good bits\n\n[i] the rpg bits [/i]\n\nalso good music/art style", "timestamp_created": 1490511048, "timestamp_updated": 1490511048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.401326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30266692": {"recommendationid": "30266692", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077416796", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495386181}, "language": "french", "review": "T-RPG particuli\u00e8rement prometteur, tr\u00e8s amusant et avec une OST de tr\u00e8s bonne qualit\u00e9 !

It's got a long road ahead of it. From what I played I'd be happy to see it through to the end.\n\nPros:\n\n-Simplistic yet beautiful art style that does a good job of capturing the scale of things, especially when looking at scenery while zoomed out. \n\n-The Gameplay is new and fresh, with a unique style and spin on tactics that makes you think on your toes and really makes having good tactics a necessary measure for success. I can't see myself being bored of it, kind of like Fire Emblem although very different in a lot of major ways.\n\n-New mechanics are added quite frequently making each level more fresh and interesting especially when the stealth feature comes along.\n\n-The soundtrack is amazing... A perfect blend of old and new, with undertones of pixely noises and an explosion of gushing fantasy adventure melodies that really speaks the game's nature without you even seeing it. The one track that really stands out is The Steppe which I might have to start listening to on a daily basis.\n\n-Boss fights that are spectacular and really force you to use the mechanics of the game to your advantage. \n\nCons:\n\n-The game of course, is still in development, I haven't encountered any game-breaking bugs but error messages do occasionally pop up on screen when dealing with a certain type of enemy. Which can get annoying.\n\n-Again, it's in early access for a reason. I was able to complete it in two hours which is an incredibly short amount of time, but the game is not finished. There are only currently two sort-of chapters in the game, each ending with a boss fight. And while I enjoyed my time with it, I find myself only wishing there was more I could play.\n\n-The story... This one is a bit in the middle I would say. At the beginning the story is a bit run-of-the-mill not really anything to get too excited over or really be invested in. But I can clearly see it picking up later on as at the end of the second boss fight I did find myself wanting to know what was going to happen.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAll and all, I'd urge you to put your money into this and support it. It's going somewhere, even though it was released two years ago it clearly has places that need to be visited and ideas that need exploring. I see myself coming back to this game each time they announce that something new is being added. I'm very saddened to see such an amazing work fall under the radar, this game really needs a spotlight, it's clearly something more than the usual thousands of games that get released each month.

VERY, VERY, *VERY* SHORT! ***\n\nLet's just get that out of the way.  Shortness aside, the tactical combat system is absolutely fantastic, and I don't think I ran into ANY bugs for the SHORT *ahem* time it took me to finish the current campaign, which is a rarity among early access games, so that's good.\n\nFOR THOSE LOOKING TO BUY THE GAME: Expect to see something with a ton of potential, but something that has not reached 90% of that potential (as of when I wrote this).  The entirety of the game currently consists of a very short campaign (less than 10 levels, I think), and four class preview showcases (each is a single pre-made encounter with no story; for testing unit types).  THERE IS NOT CURRENTLY MULTIPLAYER...or if there is, it's very very well hidden.\n\n\n\nMY REASON FOR A POSITIVE REVIEW: Even though the game is not in what I would call \"active\" development, the combat system is fantastic and unique.  Maybe it's just a fluke, but I haven't played even one other game with this type of battle system, and it's very well done.  The closest I've come to something like this is probably Growlanser Generations in one direction and Fire Emblem in the other...but IMO this game's combat system is more interesting than either of those at its core.  It just needs more added to it.\n\n\n\nFOR THE DEVS: The game is absolutely fantastic so far.  I hope someday you manage to get a full campaign and a custom battle + level editor in there.  IMO, this game would shine brightest in squad-based pvp.  You may be avoiding a lot of publicity since you're busy and not actively developing, and don't want to disappoint people who expect the game to be done within a year, but if you decide you want more people to notice your game, consider showing it at conventions and events.  If I were judging it as a up-and-coming indie title (and to be fair, didn't know it had already been on the market for years), it would probably be my top pick.

The mechanics are simple and the difficulty is ramped up in a really intuitive way that slowly offers the player new ways to see situations and learn the mechanics.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nAs said by others, the strategy plays out a lot like futbol plays where both the player and the enemy are positioning characters and using the proper skill (parry/disarm/attack/dodge/etc.) that will put the player in a stronger position for the next turn.\n\nYou start getting accustomed to about how far parries and dodges will put the enemy and you start stacking plays to do some real strategical damage. When your plays work out you just feel so boss!\n\nART/MUSIC:\nThe game is beautiful in both art and sound and you'll find yourself zoning out to the ambient piano tracks.\n\nVERDICT:\nOverall a really solid game even in Early Access.

And that's a shame, since tactical rpgs are among my favorite types of games. Now  here comes Flamberge walking in, adding another adjective to an already long genre name, claiming to be a \"simultaneous turn-based tactics RPG,\" which sounds like it must be oxymoronic. But oxymoron or not, Flamberge's combat works, and it works well. It's a fun and fairly unique combat system, and I'm happy to add Flamberge to my \"Turnbased tactics rpg\" shelf.\n\nThere's a demo on the developer website if you want to try the game out first.\n\nHowever, as of right now, there isn't all that much content. The story isn't there, there's no customization and you'll probably finish all the single player missions in under an hour. That will all change of course, it's an early access game after all, but as of the date of this review, the single player component might not last you long, so if you're on a tight gaming budget, you might consider waiting a while before getting this one. You'll probably get a good bit of mileage if you play muliplayer though.\n\nSo, anyway, I think Flamberge is a very promising title, I look forward to it's future, and I trust the developer will deliver.", "timestamp_created": 1427383566, "timestamp_updated": 1427383566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.672924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15055638": {"recommendationid": "15055638", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978639219", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428548972}, "language": "english", "review": "Flamberge, A challenging turn based strategy delight.\n\nSo In my first 30 minutes with 'Flamberge' I have to say it was so awesome. The pixel art is well done and the music is spot on.\n\nHowever, what makes this game shine imo is the blend of tactical turn based combat and strategy. \n\nBoth you and the enemies turns are taken at the same time. You must strategically move your party around the battlefield and try to set up \"plays\" and dodge, parry, shield smash, charge, face stab(I'm assuming, I mean where else would you stab the guy?) your opponent. \n\nThis makes for such a different turn based strategy experience. Each turn you're looking at what the enemy can do, which abilities are on cool down and whether or not they're out thinking your dash to the right or your retreat. \n\nI haven't tried multiplayer yet, but I can only imagine playing against a human counter-part would be incredibly challenging. \n\nThis is a game you have to support, if not for you then do it for me so I can get more content.\nCheck out my first 30 minutes below!

The animation is good as always, though it looks a little rusty in some spots. I'd recommend this one over the third game by far, as it is a lot more interesting, and Luther is a much better character.\n\nOne problem I do have is that in the ending sequence, Freddi and Luther had problems with the mouth movements, with Luther's mouth moving when Freddi was talking, and sometimes neither of their mouths moving. Night Dive, could you patch that? It definitely wasn't a problem in the original disc release.\n\nYou really really should check this game out for your kids if you have them, and it's still a fun game to play by yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1515898730, "timestamp_updated": 1515898730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39155043": {"recommendationid": "39155043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032624748", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1515338674}, "language": "english", "review": "Humongous Entertainment have done it again.\n\nJoin Freddi and Luther on a thrilling adventure in a fictional world where coral reefs are healthy and the fish eat taffy.\n\nWith innovative features such as collectible sea urchins, a lack of loot boxes and a strong female protagonist, this penultimate installment of the Freddi Fish pentalogy will blow any AAA game out of the water.\n\nok jks the game is broken\nbut it was good when i was 6", "timestamp_created": 1515338860, "timestamp_updated": 1515338860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38724938": {"recommendationid": "38724938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242186814", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514351156}, "language": "english", "review": "You get to dress up as a cool wrestler and drink sodas 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1514352346, "timestamp_updated": 1514352346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36469592": {"recommendationid": "36469592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345603158", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510123596}, "language": "italian", "review": "Unico gioco per Mac in italiano di Humongous Entertainment (mentre Nightdive Studios ne ha solo un altro, qui su Steam).

I know, it's a bold claim with Freddi Fish 1 and 2 being so bland and terribly-made but I legitimately think this is the worst of the bunch.\n\nFreddi Fish 4 starts you up on the traditional Freddi Fish plotline- you're going to some event, when it's been postponed due to a problem that's been incited by someone (either singular or plural) having done something that's \"just plain wrong\" in the eyes of our titular character, and you decided to go beyond the boundaries of the law to stop that plain wrong thing from continuing. And like the first two games there isn't a whole lot of mystery. It's just finding a rustler disguise. You know where the hideout is and who stole the hogfish. It's just getting in that becomes the bulk of the story- not the mystery of who stole it, but how to get in and free the hogfish. \n\nThe story goes by so alarmingly fast and has so many faults in it, that it's hard to find anything I really liked in it, apart from the unintentionally funny one-liners and horrible presentation quality. I've never played a Humongous game with such a lack of focus on detail. Sure, I like to insult Putt Putt and the last few Freddi Fish games, but they still animated their games well and didn't have glitches or issues with characters and their backgrounds. Freddi and Luther oftentimes appear beneath an object, but still are swimming as if they're in front of it, and sometimes characters that are standing with their legs look like they're floating above the ground. \n\nEven the lip-syncing is thrown way off; making the ending espcially funny. During the scene where you discover who stole the hogfish with a final clue (Freddi Fish 3 style) Freddi and Luther keep moving their mouths, but its Freddi's voice that's coming out of both of them. Uncanny and creepy, but still hilarious to no end. \n\nHonestly, what I hate the most about Freddi Fish 4 is that it doesn't really progress forward from the last few games. There was a rise in quality from Freddi Fish 1-3, though it wasn't astounding. Freddi Fish 3 actually had a mystery, and I genuinely wanted to find out the answer behind it. Freddi Fish 4 just borrows the drab backgrounds that plagued Freddi Fish 1 and 2, and steals the cheap final clue and culprit ending of 3 without doing anything to improve itself in that regard. \n\nI know this sounds oddly sophisticated for a review on a game intended for 5-year-olds, but I still appreciate the Humongous games that have enough quality and polish in them for both kids and adults. And the only 3 games that have enough polish in their library to be recommended are still only Pajama Sam 1 and 3, and Spy Fox 3. While the rest of their games have been slightly charming, Freddi Fish 4 just feels astoundingly lazy. Very little time or effort was put into this installment, and it really shows unfortunately.

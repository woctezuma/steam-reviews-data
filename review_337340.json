[/b][/h1]\n\nFinding Paradise \u00e9 a sequ\u00eancia de To the Moon, ambos os jogos sendo verdadeiras [b]obras-primas[/b] do [strike]desgra\u00e7ado[/strike] supremo Kan Gao. Embora n\u00e3o seja necess\u00e1rio ter jogado o primeiro para entender o que se passa no segundo, recomendo com todas as for\u00e7as (e armas) que tenho para que voc\u00ea o fa\u00e7a. Um jogo que levou cerca de  anos para ser desenvolvido n\u00e3o poderia desapontar aqueles que o esperavam. E, adivinha? [b][i]N\u00c3O DESAPONTOU NEM UM POUCO.[/i][/b]\n\nA hist\u00f3ria gira em torno dos parceiros Dr. Neil Watts e Dra. Eva Rosalene, doutores da Sigmund Corp. e que t\u00eam um trabalho curioso: Eles viajam por entre as mem\u00f3rias de pessoas quase mortas afim de realizar seu maior desejo. Calma, eu sei que parece estranho, mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 [strike]tanto assim[/strike]. Para transmitir um sonho presente em algum ponto da vida do paciente, \u00e9 preciso conhecer toda a hist\u00f3ria (ou, pelo menos, a parte necess\u00e1ria) do mesmo para entender o porqu\u00ea do desejo, modificando a trajet\u00f3ria das mem\u00f3rias o quanto for necess\u00e1rio. E \u00e9 a\u00ed que Kan Gao faz voc\u00ea correr pra farm\u00e1cia da esquina pra comprar lencinhos.\n\nCada jogo trata-se de um paciente diferente, neste sendo Colin Reeds, um piloto aposentado cujo desejo precisa ser descoberto na viagem dentro de sua cabe\u00e7a. N\u00e3o darei spoilers, mas digo que esse \u00e9 o ponto principal da reviravolta. O enredo \u00e9 digno de um filme, se quiser saber. E, um ponto chave: Voc\u00ea controla o Neil na maior parte do tempo, ou seja, [b]sarcasmo all the way, baby![/b] Agora, s\u00e9rio, voc\u00ea devia comprar o jogo s\u00f3 pela carisma do Neil. N\u00e3o que a Eva n\u00e3o seja carism\u00e1tica, mas eu j\u00e1 disse que eu amo o Neil? Enfim, voc\u00eas entenderam.\n\nMen\u00e7\u00e3o mais-que-honrosa para a trilha sonora sensacional de Kan Gao e Laura Shigihara, que conseguem arrepiar qualquer pessoa em quest\u00e3o de segundos. Cada m\u00fasica se encaixa perfeitamente com o momento e faz voc\u00ea se sentir dentro da hist\u00f3ria, mesmo que a jornada seja deveras curta (umas 5h, 6h e voc\u00ea termina o jogo). \n\nEnt\u00e3o, \u00e9 isso. Finding Paradise emociona, faz a espera valer a pena e, sobretudo, \u00e9 maravilhoso. Se voc\u00ea gosta de uma hist\u00f3ria boa e emocionante, \u00e9 seu [b][i]DEVER[/i][/b] comprar este jogo.\n\n100/10", "timestamp_created": 1514740152, "timestamp_updated": 1514740235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38907389": {"recommendationid": "38907389", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994782535", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 511, "last_played": 1514738190}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful story, very imaginative and creative.

Although I can't say that I had a personification/imaginary friend that I took to adulthood, I do know what it's like to see the world through a negative perspective. When Faye always pointed out how Colin is such a downer, I never thought much of it more than an observation. But then when she took full control of his memories and merely shifted them to include the happy memories he made instead of his previous memories that mainly focused on his regrets and mistakes in the later half of his life, it shook me to the core. Because in this game, for me, no major change in Colin's life was made at all, but rather, Faye just gently nudged his memories so that they included the good that sprung from his decisions instead of having him focus on what went wrong in his life, which now seem comparatively trivial in hindsight. Did Colin accidentally spill his drink on his honeymoon? Sure, but he then learned about the usefulness of invisible ink, which he made great use of afterwards. Did Colin hire the wrong guy who can't seem to spell anything for his proposal? Perhaps, but she still married him regardless and loved him deeply for decades afterwards. \nSPOILERS END HERE\nAlthough I can't say I shed any tears for this game (although, the more playthroughs I watch of the game, the more tears I shed, so this statement is no longer valid :P), it definitely hit me where I didn't expect it to hit. When I initially approached this game, I was hoping to have my lacrimal glands destroyed to oblivion. What I got instead was unexpected but also extremely refreshing. As with its prequel, I'd fully recommend this game and am recommending at the moment to anyone, both video game enthusiasts and non-enthusiasts alike. After all, I believe that there's a lesson or two we can always learn from games produced by Kan Gao and FreeBird games and that it doesn't require the most in-depth game mechanics to craft a compelling story, as you have all proved time and time again.\nAs for the soundtrack, once again, this OST has knocked the ball out of the park yet again. I watched both trailers for this game and was so hyped that I would repeatedly return to them hoping that the story and music will deliver (which they both did). I could never imagine playing any of these games without a tear-jerking theme in the background to match the ambience of the story. There is even a part in the game where music from the first trailer of \"Finding Paradise\" kicked in, and I was blown away that it took so long to make its appearance. The occasion it was queued for, however, was very fitting. I will definitely purchase the soundtrack for this game, as I have for the first, but that will have to wait until my wallet fills up again.\nUntil then, I look forward to the next artful masterpiece that will come out and spend the rest of my time acting on the ideas that were presented to me in this delightful game.", "timestamp_created": 1514690314, "timestamp_updated": 1514691352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38885967": {"recommendationid": "38885967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151840772", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 307, "last_played": 1514688925}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u73a9\u5230\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u771f\u7684\u5fcd\u4e0d\u4f4f\u4e86\uff0c\u54ed\u7684\u6b62\u4e0d\u4f4f", "timestamp_created": 1514689080, "timestamp_updated": 1514689080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38885883": {"recommendationid": "38885883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102513334", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 720, "last_played": 1514642639}, "language": "english", "review": ">tfw no imaginary friend\n\n11/10\nTo be honest, after playing To The Moon I've had high expectations for the sequel and guess what, this masterpiece does not disappoint.

However, I feel like that's definitely not enough to describe how much \" Finding Paradise\" left me in wonder and awe.\n\n-For a game that only took me 5 hrs to play, it felt like I was actually unfolding someone's lifetime worth of memories. \n-Everything from the whimsical characters , to immersive plot, everything about this game is an experience. \n\nNote: I haven't played a bird's story, nor did I know that it was a continuation. So do play that first then experience this :)\n\nThe order would be : To the Moon, Minisode 1 , Minisode 2, A Bird's Story, Finding Paradise. The minisodes just add a bit more depth to the characters and the Sigmund Organisation etc :) ( I'll update again if I'm wrong)\n\n\n\n[h1] First Impressions[/h1]\n-Absolutely astounding mix of delicate and whimisical characters , a lot of character development\n\n\n\n\n[h1] Plot [/h1]\n-Would you sacrifice a lifetime of memories , for a new set? Or maybe, just to fufill a dream?\n- What can you do when a compromise between decisions need to be made?\n- What happens when there's a blurred line between dreams and reality , where your dreams can come true?\n\nSimply, you play as the agents from Sigmund- Classic O'Neil and eloquent Dr Eva Rosaline whose goal is to fufill one's final wish at his/her's last breath. That itself isn't a spoiler. \n\nTo do so, you travel back to their past and witness the events of an individual's life unfold. All the emotions felt, all the causes and consequences and \"what ifs\" revealed in plain sight. It's a surreal experience, to be able to wander through and see why and how the client became who they in their present moment. \n\n\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1] \n- Simple click and point , discovery game.\n- The goal is to find memory orbs and links to be able to \"unlock\" a memento. \n- Puzzles involve a lot of switching and matching- The Difficulty definiterly increases\n-It's highly philosophical :)\n- Depending on the situation, there may be a set of combat options but nothing too grand ( fun easter eggs to be unlocked too, without spoiling ofc :))\n\n\n[h1] Art [/h1]\n-Pixel Art - Beautiful nostalgic and calm art. \n- At times, the pixels can be really detailed too :)\n- Reminds me of the classic snes games like zelda, chrono trigger :)\n\n\n[h1]Music & Soundtrack[/h1]\n- I'd describe this as natural sounding music. Everything goes so well with the scenes \n-Loopable themes - Piano :)\n- Really serene orchaestral music \n- Transitions to Epic Music occasionally.\n\n\n\n[h1]Symbolism[/h1]\n- We learn about the client and his/her life through symbolism and interaction with mementos.\n- It's basically filled with symbolism, to each of their own :)\n\n\n\n[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]\nIf one was to abandon all their regrets or chased their \"what ifs\" , what would become of the current form of themselves? Simply, it would cease to exist. \n\nThis game is purely about acceptance of what is and isn't, but I'll leave that to you to judge. \n\nI promise you, if you're wandering around, unsure of what to make of your current life, or even just want a surreal experience through another pair of eyes, then I strongly recommend \"Finding Paradise\". \n\nP.S. To the Frosty that gifted me this game, you're a legend.

I am not claiming it in a masculine undertone, but instead in the methods that work of art impose through a major amount of text. Whenever I read a novel, I never find myself in the verge of tears over an emotional scene. It may, persay, get my heart in a sort of drowsiness, but that's about it. So when I say that I had big droplets coming down at the end of this game, I can safely declare that such a game is a complete masterpiece. \n\nThe concept is already incredible and hard to think about without posing the ethics, the correctiveness, and the technical aspects of it, and regardless, it is still something worth talking about at any given moment. This sequel kicked off just like the original, with a new twist in the mechanics of the machine and an explanation behind said mechanics. Everything ties together and you can tell that Kan Gao is not fucking around when he writes his stories. \n\nApart from the side-story with Sigmund Corp., the story itself begun simple to me, and I already had expectations for how it would turn out. Of course, the genius of Kan made you believe certain events would happen, when in reality, it was something completely different. Truthfully, Kan Gao knows how to correctly write a plot twist, and even more, how to write a plot twist that is subtle, but predictable and not spontaneously ex-machina. \n\nThe ending of the story punched me into a muse of thought that shifted itself into one of emotions, and before I knew it I began to cry at the complete melancholy that was this story, this game, this experience.\n\nFinding Paradise is a work of art that cannot be compared easily to other scientific works, but instead deserves a spot at the very top of those of the genre. So much was left for me to think in only four hours of playing it.

"[i]Finding Paradise[/i] is beautiful, heartfelt and a worthy follow-up to [i]To The Moon[/i].  The light puzzle and exploration gameplay serves to illustrate the story of a man's life, wishes and regrets that shows a keen understanding of human nature.  As a sequel, it improves on the original in length, gameplay, art/graphics, and humour, while also telling a different story.  Despite the multi-year wait I was happy, and recommend it to anyone who likes emotional narrative-driven games.\n\nThe gameplay divides into three types: periodic simple puzzles; exploration; and some more arcade-like mini-games later on.  In this regard it follows its predecessor, but I found all three elements improved.  The puzzles are simple, but varied with new mechanics introduced throughout.  The exploration sections divide up the story, and serve to draw attention to the relative importance of different events in Colin's life.  The arcade sections are simple and silly, but fun and less frustrating than the [i]To The Moon[/i] equivalent.\n\nAway from the gameply, the art design is good and the music excellent.  The humour also hit the mark frequently, one area that I felt was much improved over its predecessor.  [i]Finding Paradise[/i] also avoids the sequel trap of telling the same story with the names changed.  This has its downside; [i]To The Moon[/i] was noted for its emotional sledgehammer, but here the story places greater emphasis on mystery and humour.  But it also knows how to play your emotions when appropriate.\n\nDespite my references to the previous game, [i]Finding Paradise[/i] is a stand-alone game.  To those unfamiliar with the SigCorp Universe, this is a satisfying introduction.  Old fans should find this a worthwhile continuation.

Instead the story focuses more on the other idea and greatly describes the power of our brain.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately the downside is of course much weaker story in general. The game offers more shenanigans around Sigmund Corp, and I can get that a lot of people will not like it. But the game still does it, in the smoothest way possible, without trying to enforce anything onto players in an obvious way (even though it is deeply connected to the moon, its minisodes and A bird story)\n\n\n\nAn upside? The story will still force you to think and brain-storm the plot as you play through it. A different plot, that is, maybe not what would To The Moon fans expect, but it's better this way than repeating itself.\n\n\n\nAll in all - it is a must play for anyone who touched To The Moon. You may even dislike it a lot on the first half of the game, only then to get punched for thinking everything is gonna be simple and clear.\n\nIf you haven't played To The Moon - I would strongly suggest getting that first.

By this point, I understand what he means. There are a number of really cool contrasts between Finding Paradise and To The Moon, and I found Finding Paradise to be much more polished, well-written, and personally, more engaging than To The Moon. (This is not to say that I disliked To The Moon; rather, that I liked Finding Paradise so much more.)\n\nWhat Finding Paradise did well: the entire game just felt more polished as a whole, both in terms of mechanics and in terms of writing (though presumably, part of this can be attributed to the fact it's the second game.) I liked the story a lot more as it felt more relatable, and the banter between Neil and Eva was sharper and more on point; I also appreciated the amount of development Neil got (and to a lesser extent, Eva.) I liked the information portioned out to us about SigCorp, the machine, and whatever is going on with Neil, and learning more about Roxie and Robert was lovely, though I get the sense that some things have transpired in the interim. Finding Paradise also nicely advances the meta-plot, with continued hints that something is--not quite--right with the world as is given to us.\n\nI like the branches as well; clearly, this is not a 'choices have consequences' sort of RPG, but I like how different choices offer you different insights into the shared world and situations of Finding Paradise.\n\nFinding Paradise has heart. It's a different kind of heart from To The Moon -- it's not about love, but about happiness, regrets, and loneliness. To that extent, I find it much more relatable. \n\nIssues: I found it strange to introduce a mechanic to swap between Neil and Eva -- it's a great mechanic, and I like it, but why introduce it if we can't use it except at the beginning? \n\nStill, would recommend and am eagerly anticipating (what, in 2023?) the next installment :P", "timestamp_created": 1514516729, "timestamp_updated": 1514516729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38803699": {"recommendationid": "38803699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005300787", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 275, "last_played": 1514515862}, "language": "english", "review": "I couldn't imagine having as great a bro as Faye.", "timestamp_created": 1514515899, "timestamp_updated": 1514522615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38803423": {"recommendationid": "38803423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063058551", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 298, "last_played": 1514335979}, "language": "swedish", "review": "Masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1514515209, "timestamp_updated": 1514515209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38802860": {"recommendationid": "38802860", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982287654", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 328, "last_played": 1514513380}, "language": "english", "review": "Thank you!

Quando poi esce il seguito di tale gioco, le aspettative sono molto alte!\nEbbene, Kan Gao \u00e8 riuscito nell'impresa di confezionare un gioco in grado di toccare il cuore dei giocatori e farli piangere come ci era riuscito con il precedente.\nFinding Paradise \u00e8 la naturale evoluzione di To the Moon: stesse meccaniche minimali, stessa grafica a pixel che piace a moltissimi, una nuova storia. O meglio, una nuova vita! Perch\u00e8 \u00e8 questo quello a cui partecipiamo: alla vita di un uomo, ai suoi ricordi, alle sue gioie e ai suoi dolori. Ma in Finding Paradise si va oltre: se in To the Moon Johnny aveva un obiettivo fisso, per l'appunto andare sulla luna, in Finding Paradise per Colin \u00e8 diverso.

Get it on sale, get it at full price, and get a copy for someone who has an appreciation for complexity in storytelling. \n\n\nIf you've never played To the Moon, there are two things you should know: (1) you don't need to play To The Moon FIRST in order to love Finding Paradise, but (2) you should play To The Moon (and its two free DLC minisodes) anyway for the complete narrative experience. \n\nThis is a complex, surprising, unpredictable, emotional and rewarding story. This is one that lives just as much in your mind as it does the minds of the characters involved. When the credits roll, and you begin to think of the implications of what you've beheld, you start to realize that the impact of the events which transpire can't help but continue to impact the characters in meaningful ways that we may never get to see, but we can confidently conclude what \"it all means.\" \n\n\nJRR Tolkein resolved to create a work that would make the world a better place by simply being a good thing within it. He penned the world of Middle Earth; this was his contribution to improving the overall net worth of our rock floating through space. And improve it he did. \n\n\nKan Gao and his team have done something similar; they have taken the medium and used it to bring their audiences to emotional highs and lows with enormous skill, insight and charm. Innovative isn't the word to use here; wisdom, vulernerability and \"heart\" are more appropriate.

Instead of understanding the other, we want to erase them. Instead of looking at the darkness inside, we blame everyone and anyone for the lack of light. We live in difficult times.\n\nAnd in times like these, a game like Finding Paradise is nothing short of a wonder.\n\nBut you know, I was afraid.\n\nI was afraid, I confess. Afraid of what kind of game this would turn out to be, afraid of how I would perceive it. Six years ago, maybe more, To The Moon made a huge impression on me. Better saying, it hit me like a battering ram, broke every single defense I had and left me completely exposed and vulnerable. To this day, when I hear \u201cEverything\u2019s Alright\u201d, a lot of those same emotions come back. It is not only due to how well the story is written (fantastically well, I must say) but also due to my own personal experience that helped me relate so much with almost everything presented in To The Moon.\n\nNeedless to say, it was one of the most important games I ever played, and one of most amazing works of art I ever experienced.\u00a0\n\nBut a lot of time passed. I grew older, a lot of hardships came and I am more cynical and bitter than six years ago. And tired. Much more tired. And while I did enjoy quite a lot A Bird\u2019s Story, for me this game right here was the real deal.\n\nSo yeah, I was afraid. Afraid that, in the end, I would not be able to live the same experience as before. That I had changed too much to care anymore.\n\nAnd I was partially right. It wasn\u2019t the same experience as before. This time, it went beyond.\n\nWhile To The Moon will always have its\u2019 place in my heart for being such a intimate and relatable story, Finding Paradise has a place in my very being. It is not just relatable, it is constructive, it fills us inside. This time I didn\u2019t finish the game feeling vulnerable; instead I felt gratitude, I felt happy for who I am and who I was. The tears came, of course they came, but it wasn\u2019t the desperate waterfall of before. They were warm, comforting.\n\nTo me, Finding Paradise shows what kind of man Kan Gao is. He understands people, he is sensible and understands humans and their conflicts, their difficulties. Loneliness, regret, denial, trauma, fear, defense mechanisms, coping mechanisms, all the hardships that we constantly face on a deeper level within us are present in his simple games. Simple, but not simplistic.\n\nAnd the silly humor of his characters and their mannerisms, their personalities so well defined, brings us even closer to them. It helps us care about a bunch of pixels in such a way that so many huge developers, with their huge sums of money spent on mo-cap and thousands upon thousands of polygons per character, never seem to achieve.\n\nBut most of all, Kan Gao was able to mature, was able to grow during this six years window between the two games. He didn\u2019t just make a sequel that feels the same but with a different color. He made a game that stands on its\u2019 own while building itself on top of his predecessor. While To The Moon main theme was \u201cWho you really are\u201d, Finding Paradise main theme is \u201cWhat is really important\u201d. Going from one theme to another, while keeping the soul of the games pure, intact, that is maturity, that is growth. More than that I cannot say.\n\nWhat I can say is this:\n\nAs we dream and as we grow\nWe have to learn to let things go\nBut let the wonder never fade\nThough we\u2019ve turned 10,000 pages\nFlying high or stuck below", "timestamp_created": 1514356480, "timestamp_updated": 1514356480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502370", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38726224": {"recommendationid": "38726224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110211206", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 328, "last_played": 1514485433}, "language": "english", "review": "I have no words for how badly I need a hug.", "timestamp_created": 1514355644, "timestamp_updated": 1514434757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38725522": {"recommendationid": "38725522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220043799", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 319, "last_played": 1514353284}, "language": "english", "review": "An emotional and amazing game - had me laughing and crying.

dato la stessa enorme sensazione di inaspettata quanto letale pugnalata al cuore come \u00e8 stato in to the moon.. in questo capitolo della saga (perch\u00e8 si, \u00e8 una saga e ci saranno molto probabilmente altri episodi) il tutto non \u00e8 taciuto fino all'ultimo per poi rilasciare tutto in solo fragoroso botto, no. qui il tutto \u00e8 spalmato lungo tutta la storia e il finale, seppur non ai livelli del primo in quanto ad emozioni suscitate, \u00e8 la degna conclusione di questo capitolo, per come \u00e8 stato strutturato. \n\nrispetto al precedente capitolo troviamo una grafica molto pi\u00f9 curata (parlando di un gioco sviluppato con rpg maker), che fa un uso assai sapiente di parallax, weather effect, dissolvenze, giochi di luce e sfondi. il tutto accompagnato da una soundtrack che fa egregiamente il suo dovere, esaltando lo specifico contesto di ogni evento del gioco.\n\nil lavoro fatto nel creare sprite unici per ogni scena \u00e8 stupendo, per chi conosce che

nella ricchezza di particolari che popolano ogni scena.\n\nparlando delle musiche, la qualit\u00e0 \u00e8 altissima e troviamo dei bellissimi pezzi che ho subito provveduto ad acquistare ma, per mio modesto gusto personale, non riescono ad avere quel \"qualcosa in pi\u00f9\" che caratterizzava le musiche del primo capitolo. non ho trovato nessun corrispettivo emotivo ad una \"the river\" o \"everithing will be alright\" per intenderci, ma ci\u00f2 non vuol dire che la qualit\u00e0 non sia la medesima.\n\nconclusione:\nfinding paradise riesce nell'intento di tenere testa al suo

in modo da non ricalcare pari passo le orme del primo capitolo e dare comunque una sensazione di evoluzione della storia generale.\n\nse poi, i rumor e le teorie dietro alla sottotrama generale della saga si riveleranno corrette, potremo dire che kan gao ha ideato, creato e orchestrato una saga che dire geniale ed emozionante \u00e8 un eufemismo. il tempo ci dir\u00e0 la verit\u00e0.",

FANTASTIC music. It hits all of your feels from every angle\n[*]Solid writing. Clever, imaginative, funny, and honest as well as feeling realistic and shedding light onto the characters\n[*]Unconventional storytelling. Telling such poignant and emotional stories is a bold move, but even bolder is telling them in the form of a video game.  And on top of that, the stories themselves are told unconventionally: in To the Moon told the story backwards, A Bird Story had no dialogue and almost no words whatsoever, and Finding Paradise [spoiler] jumps back and forth from old Colin to young Colin.[/spoiler]  Initially these unique storytelling methods might be troubling, but they were expertly done, and the stories would not have been nearly as effective without them. \n[/list]\nSome Steam reviews have expressed their disappointment with Finding Paradise's ability to make them cry. Some have said, \"good game, but it's no To the Moon,\" or something of the sort. But of course it isn't--Freebird Games already made To the Moon. What I mean to say is, they already made a simplistic and sweet story about life, memories, the nature of storytelling, and what we choose to hold dear and why. Finding Paradise has a decisively different feel but deals with the same themes in a new and equally brilliant way. The game was confusing, exciting, lively, and fun while also being heavy and blindingly clear when it needed to be. While To the Moon felt like a night spent gazing at the sky, Finding Paradise feels like an airplane adventure. \n\nFinding Paradise is not To the Moon. It's an outstanding sequel. And I for one (likely along with at least 2000 other people judging from the positive reviews Finding Paradise already has) will be anxiously awaiting the next chapter in the story. We'll be expecting laughs, tears, thrown shoes, kamehamehas, and more tears again. \n\nTL;DR: If you think you'd like Finding Paradise, play it.

Es transportierte Gef\u00fchle besser als jedes andere Spiel, das ich bis dahin gespielt hatte, hatte genau die richtge Menge Humor und erz\u00e4hle eine Geschichte, die so tragisch, herzergreifend und emotionals war, wie nur wenige Spiele oder auch Filme allgemein es geschafft haben. Und das mit so wenigen Mittel und dieser Grafik. Kan Gao hat dabei bereits gezeigt zu welchen Leistungen er F\u00e4hig ist und was f\u00fcr ein genialer Gechichtenerz\u00e4hler er sein kann.\nDoch genug von To the moon und kommen wir zu Finding Paradise.\nDer erste gro\u00dfe Nachfolger von TTM (es gab mehrere kleine Zwischenepisoden) ist wiedermal ein Brett was das Geschichtenerz\u00e4hlen und die Musik angeht. Auch dieses mal gibt es eine sch\u00f6ne tragische Geschichte, die von wunderbarer Musik genau richtig untermalt wird. Und auch dieses mal hat Gao wieder an die genau richtige Menge Humor gedacht, bei der ich teilweise laut auflachen musste und in die H\u00e4nde geklascht habe.\nDoch erreicht Finding Paradise nicht ganz das Level des Vorg\u00e4ngers. Dabei war ich am ehesten von der Geschichte sowas wie entt\u00e4uscht. Dabei darf man das aber nicht \u00fcberinterpretieren. Die Geschichte ist immer noch hervorrgend. Doch \u00fcbernimmt sich Gao meiner Meinung nach etwas dabei die Tragig in die Geschichte zu bringen. Bis zur Mitte des Spiels war ich noch voll dabei, aber im weiteren Verlauf verliert die Geschichte etwas an Bodenhaftung und verpasst es so echte Gef\u00fchle auf den Niveau von To the moon hervorzurufen. \nAber alleine daran, wie lang dieses Review bereits ist und dass ich es um 2 uhr nachts schreibe erkennt man wie gut das Spiel dennoch geworden ist. So ist Finding Paradise immernoch ein extrem gelungenes Spiel und eine weitere Darstellung des Talentes des gesamten Teams von Freebird Games. \nUnd so kann ich nur jedem, der dieses Review tats\u00e4chlich bis zum Ende  durchgelesen hat (Hallo du einziger verr\u00fcckter Kerl ;) ) nur empfehlen: Kauf dir Finding Paradise und falls du es noch nicht gespielt hast, spiel zuerst To the

Wie kann man ein Spiel schlagen, welches ohnehin schon fast perfekt scheint? Kleine Vorwarnung: Es wurde nicht geschlagen, es hat genau dasselbe Level an Storytelling, Gameplay und Character Development beibehalten, wie man es erwwartet hat. Einige Ver\u00e4nderungen in Punkten Steuerung und Gameplay wurden vorgenommen, welche aber nicht weiter beschrieben werden m\u00fcssen\n\nDoch auch wenn die Geschichte eine andere ist, ist es noch lange kein neues Spiel. Wenn man den Vorg\u00e4nger gespielt hat, wei\u00df man eigentlich schon, was auf einen zukommt. Packende Story, unerwartete Wendungen in der Geschichte und grandiose Charaktere. Doch auch, wenn dieselben Hauptprotagonisten, in Form von Dr. Eva Rosalene und Dr. Neil Watts, ein gro\u00dfartiges Comeback in diesen Teil feiern, reicht es meiner Meinung nach nicht aus. Die Geschichte regt zum Nachdenken an und wirkt auf den ersten Moment emotional, doch die vielleicht letzte Spielstunde war meiner Meinung nach ein kleines bisschen zu \u00fcbertrieben aufgesetzt.\n\nMehr kann ich dazu auch leider nicht schreiben, trotzdessen ein guter Nachfolger.\n\n-\n\nBEWERTUNG\n\n[h1]8 / 10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1514309744, "timestamp_updated": 1514309744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38705025": {"recommendationid": "38705025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121793340", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 271, "last_played": 1514307260}, "language": "english", "review": "A masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1514309634, "timestamp_updated": 1514309634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38704758": {"recommendationid": "38704758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294699241", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 261, "last_played": 1514166149}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great.

It wasn't quite that emotionally devastating and impactful (I'll explain why later in the spoiler section), but on the other hand it has improved quite a bit in its presentation. The character animations, for example, are great, plentiful and surprisingly detailed. You can tell that the success of To the Moon allowed the devs to spend more resources on them. With To the Moon, it felt like it was made in the simplistic ways of RPG maker out of necessity. This time around, it feels more like a deliberate artistic choice. The music is beautiful as well.\n\nStill, I'd definitely rank To the Moon above Finding Paradise and here is why:\n\n[spoiler]While it still got me a little teary eyed at the end, it was nothing compared to the emotional trainwreck that I'd become towards the end of To the Moon. It was still a very pleasant experience to go through, but nowhere near as impactful. I understand that Kan Gao didn't want to make yet another tragic sappy story (after all, To the Moon at times felt like it was trying REALLY hard to make the player cry, almost to the point of going too far, but still managed to keep it together somehow) so he went different route, but I still think there was more that could've been done to make players care about the characters.\n\nI am, of course, talking about Faye/Colin \"relationship\". I spend half the game expecting something terrible happening to Faye. I mean, it was obvious that something must've happened to her since she was absent from all of the more recent memories. And it turned out, she wasn't really there and was \"just\" Colin's imaginary friend. Okay. Fine. But then I got to the end and all of a sudden, there were these emotional scenes where I was clearly supposed to care a lot about Faye \"leaving\" and what not. And I did to some extent, but it just didn't feel that satisfying.\n\nThe thing about To the Moon is, that it's really sad and happy at the same time in many ways. Johnny, in his head at least, goes to the Moon with River and they live a happy life. But in reality, River dies knowing that Johnny, even after years of her trying to make him remember, doesn't in fact remember their first meeting. Sure, she says she's happy as long as Anya is taken care of, but you can't help but feel sad for her. So you get this kind of happy ending, but then you realise that it's not actually all that happy because River got none of it. After River dies, Johnny wants to go to the Moon because... well, because somewhere deep inside he actually does remember from their first meeting that, were they ever lost from each other, they would reunite on the Moon, so he wants to go there just to meet her again. Which is extremely sweet but again, River is dead at that point so she doesn't get the satisfaction she deserves. So it's all very bittersweet and it stays with you for a long time.\n\nIn Finding Paradise however, it doesn't come together quite as nicely. Colin is imagining Faye because he's lonely. And then he just kinda stops doing it because he doesn't need her anymore. I feel like, in an attemp to hide the great plot twist about Faye being fictional to the very last moment possible, her importence in Colin's life gets kind of underplayed. Sure, as said in the game, she gets a lot of screentime and many of the scenes are very beautiful and touching, but it still left me feeling like there was supposed to be more to it. There is no conflict, no tension, no reason to be torn about her leaving other than \"she was here, we had a good time and now she's gone\".\n[/spoiler]\n\nIt could be that that was the very intention. After all, most important life decisions aren't really that dramatic. They too just kind of happen, often without us realising it. And I really get that Kan Gao wanted to say something different with this game, something else than \"just\" another great tragedy, so I don't wanna be too critical about it, because I very much enjoyed it. However, it did left me feeling little bit lackluster in the end so there's that.\n\nTo the Moon was 10/10 for me, Finding Paradise is more like 8/10.

Whether the story is better than To The Moon's is debatable, but both are well worth experiencing if you care even a little bit about games as an art form.\n\nThere is great music, funny and well written characters, and the story gave me goosebumps as much as it made me smile and laugh. \n\nIf you've played TTM, you know the gameplay. It's essentially a walking simulator. There are a few puzzles in there, but they aren't too hard, and sometimes feel a little out of place. That said, they don't really detract much from the experience either. \n\nOne thing that felt kind of jarring, and broke the immersion somewhat is the dialogue between some of the children. They sometimes used words that I wouldn't expect nine year olds to use in casual conversation. \n\nStill, any critisism I have toward this game is minor, and none would keep me from recommending this game wholeheartedly. If you haven't played TTM, I recommend doing that first.\n\nNow we just have to wait for episode three, which will probably be released around 2024.", "timestamp_created": 1514292537, "timestamp_updated": 1514292537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38694489": {"recommendationid": "38694489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340882743", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 307, "last_played": 1514290366}, "language": "english", "review": "This one should be bundled with the Wolfenstein in order to feel manly again", "timestamp_created": 1514290561, "timestamp_updated": 1514290561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38693830": {"recommendationid": "38693830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071169859", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 211, "last_played": 1514288917}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7ed3\u5c40\u771f\u662f\u611f\u52a8\u5230\u6211\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1514289176, "timestamp_updated": 1514289176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38693069": {"recommendationid": "38693069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099142540", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 116, "last_played": 1514277560}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc774\uc804\uc791\uacfc \uc5f0\uad00\ub418\ub294 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uac00\uc120 \ud504\ub9ac\ubc84\ub4dc\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc791\ud488. \uba87\uba87 \uc0c8\ub86d\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc790\uc798\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5\ub3c4 \ucd94\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ub4f1 \ub178\ub825\uc758 \ud754\uc801\uc774 \uaf64\ub098 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uac8c\uc784\uc131\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc88b\ub2e4\uace0 \ub9d0\ud558\uae30\ub294 \uadf8\ub807\uace0, \uac8c\uc784\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ud55c \ud3b8\uc758 \uc601\ud654\ub97c \ubcf8\ub2e4\ub294 \uc0dd\uac01\uc744 \ud558\uace0 \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc57c \ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc774\uc720\ub85c \ud22c\ub354\ubb38\ub3c4 \uc5b4 \ubc84\ub4dc \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub3c4 \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\ub3c4 \ud638\ubd88\ud638\uac00 \uaf64\ub098 \uac08\ub824 \uba87\uba87 \uac8c\uc774\uba38\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c\ub294 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d \ub4f1\uc758 \uc774\uc720\ub85c \uc9c8\ud0c0\ub97c \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\uae30\ub3c4 \ud558\ub2e4.\n\uadf8\ub798\ub3c4 \uc774\uc804\uacfc \uac19\uc774 BGM\uacfc \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud0c4\ud0c4\ud558\uace0 \uc798 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud504\ub9ac\ubc84\ub4dc \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uad6c\ub9e4\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc815\uac00\uc774\ub4e0 \uc544\ub2c8\ub4e0 \ubb34\uc870\uac74 \uc0ac\uc6b4\ub4dc\ud2b8\ub799\ub3c4 \uad6c\ub9e4\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uadf8\ub7f4\ub9cc\ud55c \uc774\uc720\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc0ac\uc6b4\ub4dc\ud2b8\ub799\ub3c4 \uc0b4\uc9c0 \uace0\ubbfc\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0?

I just love video games, and here is my opinion.*\nFirst of all, do not play this unless you have played To the Moon and A Bird Story. If you do not, some of the dialogue and plot will not make sense.\nI absolutely adore To the Moon. A Bird Story and the minisodes were also lovely. I found Finding Paradise inferior to these. Yes, the soundtrack is gorgeous, the art is beautiful, the dialogue is engaging and comical, and the story has some heartfelt life lessons. \n\nHowever, the plot did not affect me at all. I absolutely bawled throughout To the Moon, but I did not cry once during Finding Paradise. I could not relate to the main character. The plot twist made me think, \"...Really? Are you serious? An old man with ...... That's just weird.\"\nBy the end of the game, I absolutely hated the puzzles when activating momentos. They became more complex and tedious, thereby ruining the player's immersion in the plot. The puzzles in Finding Paradise felt like road blocks, whereas in To the Moon, the puzzles were simple and felt more connected to the story. \n(Also, the game ran very poorly in regards to lagging. That might have been an issue with my own computer, but it was quite annoying and nauseating. It especially became a problem during the combat sequences which were clever but completely frustrating and out-of-place.)\n\nOverall, the soundtrack, art, and dialogue was beautiful. When the story finally came to a meaningful moment, I did not even pay attention because I was so enraged by the immersion-breaking puzzles and combat.\nHowever, I will always recommend To the Moon and support the developers because it is a masterpiece.

There are moments where there are lapses in the story to compensate for silliness, or so it would appear until you reach the ultimate goal [no spoilers provided.] Everything related to the humour of the game, excluding the very beginning, plays into the necessity of explaining the ending, and at nearly every turn you will find something that will shock you as a revelation of something you had likely previously viewed as either insignificant or minute in its complexity as part of the story.\n\nThis is gaming that has been steered away from the 'game' aspect, and more towards the story teller's side. This is not a bad thing innately, because there are games that do this in much the opposite manner, but if you are looking for something that's treated as a game where everything is explicit in its results immediately, you are at the wrong place. \"Finding Paradise\" is, at its core, a refined cinematic work of art. Feeling as though it lacks smaller facets of investigation on a personal level unlike \"To The Moon\", it still catches on with its linear figure and reducing the amount of general confusion that was accompanied by some parts in previous series entries.\n\nOnly thing, again mostly spoiler free, is that the title is misleading to the actual story telling that is provided, because you do not necessarily go looking for Paradise, but that's a minor caveat of interpretive art. All-in-all, Finding Paradise helps tie in new pieces of this beautiful series, and I can scarcely wait for the next entry to grace us.

Both his storytelling and his music are still top-notch, and I greatly enjoyed the tale he wove. [i]A Bird Story[/i] gave an excellent preview of what to expect from the memories of a person whose childhood was a muddled mix of fantasy and reality, and this final look at the same person's life did not disappoint.\n\nThe memory-unlocking minigames, though, were a little bit of an annoyance. Whereas they were interesting but not too hard to solve in [i]To The Moon[/i], they felt a bit like they interrupted the story flow at intense moments, in this one. On the other hand, the 'boss fights' in this game were absolutely great, and a lot more inspired than the Infinite Hallway of Doom (and Zombievas) in [i]To The Moon[/i] was.\n\nBesides that, I only have one remark on the game, really, and that's that in my opinion, it is not, in fact, independent from [i]To The Moon[/i], as the info text claims. Admitted, I [i]have[/i] played both, so maybe this is hard for me to judge, but in my opinion, the concept of a memory dive going drastically wrong like this would not really have the same effect if the audience hasn't experienced the (semi-)normal flow of these events as depicted in [i]To The Moon[/i].\n\nBut these were both minor things. This game is still absolutely what I expected from it, and a marvel to experience first-hand.

As such, it functions as a pretty good sequel, and it's nice how they did a rearrangement of one of the background songs from To The Moon for this game since it nicely connects the two. [spoiler] The story is about the main character in A Bird Story, so it connects the three main games very nicely. [/spoiler] However, I find the plot to be a bit too unrealistic in the way it includes superhero and supernatural elements. I think the charm of To The Moon lies in the simplicity of the story, but how it is still relatable and touching. There are a lot of cucumber references, which I also believe relate back to To The Moon, and although funny I find them to be used a bit too frequently. \n\nI like how they added the element of changing between two character perspectives, since it improves the gameplay experience and it reminds me of the game Rakuen (which was created by one of the composers for Finding Paradise and To The Moon and inspired by the two). The game builds up suspense very well to get you hooked and provided 4 hours of gameplay, so I think it\u2019s well worth your money. Although I listed a lot of criticism above, if you\u2019re looking for a sequel to To The Moon, then this is it. Finding Paradise will take you on a crazy ride and although it didn\u2019t suit my taste, the game is well made and most of my complaints relate to my personal preferences.", "timestamp_created": 1514162075, "timestamp_updated": 1514162075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38640829": {"recommendationid": "38640829", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014398635", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 258, "last_played": 1514128473}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6cea\u76ee\n\n\u4e45\u8fdd\u7684\u611f\u89c9", "timestamp_created": 1514161594, "timestamp_updated": 1514161594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38639987": {"recommendationid": "38639987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030149713", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 286, "last_played": 1514158283}, "language": "italian", "review": "Non so come descrivere a parole quello che ho provato.\nE' un turbine di strette allo stomaco ed emozioni.\nE' difficile rimanerne impassibili.\n\nAnche questa volta Kan Gao ha colpito dritto al cuore.\n\nGiocatelo assolutamente e supportate Freebird Games.", "timestamp_created": 1514158877, "timestamp_updated": 1514158877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38639741": {"recommendationid": "38639741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035193877", "num_games_owned": 636, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 351, "last_played": 1514156980}, "language": "english", "review": "Another \"GREAT\" game by Freebird.

I came to the conclusions that since the game was delayed and the time lapse between To The Moon and Finding Paradise was such a vast amount of time, that either the game wasn't going according to plan, or that they were truly perfecting it. The game ultimately fufilled what I requested from the last game - I felt the gameplay lacked enthusiasm from me, basically the same, find the memory cues, which are very fun because for me I love puzzles. However, I was delighted to be able to play as Neil Watts and go full-out battle mode. Other than that, the game fulfilled my expectations, plus an addition of more suprises that makes me want to come to the conclusion that these are my favorite RPGS of all time. Sure, portal will challenge your brain and make you laugh, or Undertale will pull at your heart strings, but these series of games, despite seeming so small, are extrodinary. (Also, I'd like to briefly mention, I NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH NEIL?!? In a more professional tone, the mystery and suspense left behind from these little hints at a bigger picture truly make me crave for more. You've cracked the code, Kan, you have all of us waiting in suspense, in the palm of your hand so-to-speak, and you could do anything....) Furthermore, my only imaginative request would be to see a spark of interest as a significant other between Neil and Eva, but that might be a bit perposterous. In conclusion, thank you Kan for all of your dedication into making such an alluring (in a good way:) franchise of games, and thank you Laura for the most beautifully composed songs.", "timestamp_created": 1514106896, "timestamp_updated": 1514106896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38613123": {"recommendationid": "38613123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104545076", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 303, "last_played": 1514105513}, "language": "english", "review": "Some people might find it not as good as to the moon, but still, please give it a try and leave the expectation from to the moon behind. As a sequel it shaped the universe of the game more solid, we start to know how sigmund run, but what to the moon never tell us is, does sigmund's service always the happy end? Yes surely people have regrets that's why they want at least something back into their life and feel they fulfilled their life.\n\nFinding Paradise story is more a sarcastic view on sigmund's service with specific cases, however that does not implying sigmund's service is anything related to moral value or human ethics, is not like what people always deem \"escaping the reality just to feel good\" kind of thing. Just that some people, really don't need their service after all.\n\nAfter playing through finding paradise, I appreciate more in the character design in this game, their perspective and their experience, I feel this is 1 step deeper of experiencing other person's life, more than I feel in to the moon.

Kan Gaos unique humour still shines but like To The Moon it can slightly mess with the tone in one or two places, though it doesn't detract from the overall experience.

All the things it tells you about life itself through the story. Everything that's said, it all gets just too real and you should definitely go ahead, buy it and experience everything from start to finish.\n\n[b] The soundtrack [/b] is just what you'd expect, if you've played To The Moon/A Bird Story, total brilliance is what it is!\nThere's just the right music at the right time and you sure are never going to forget something like this, I know I would never..\n\nI immediately bought the soundtrack after it released, it's pure heaven to my ears. I consider myself lucky to be able to experience something this beautiful. \n\nGive it a go right now if you don't own the game already, don't think much about it!\nJust get it and see it for yourself.\n\nI'd strongly recommend this game to any indie lover and I'll surely buy anything this guy (Kan R. Gao) makes.\n\n<3 Freebird Games.\n\nCan't wait for what's next.

Soundtrack always worth getting too.\n\nIf you're going to ask about the emotional impact, I didn't feel as much as with [i]To The Moon[/i], but we have a general idea of what we get now and, even then, I also had a bit of a personal takeaway from [i]To The Moon[/i] and River's character herself. Here... it hits home in a different way. I haven't exactly walked in Collin's shoes before, but it's close enough for me to empathize. I will remember his story too.\n\nRPGmaker style your jam?

To the Moon quickly became one of my favorite games of all time, so my bar was set very high for Finding Paradise. In a world where we are constantly exposed to stories that are recylced and lack orginiality, Kan Gao and Freebird games have once again found themselves a the tellers of a beautifully unique story. I cried at To the Moon, and darn if this one didn't make me do it again. You will wonder, laugh, ponder life, and likely cry in your experience playing this game. The characters are such great parts of this story, and work very well off each other. \n\nMidway through the game, before one of the twists was revealed, I thought I had figured it out, and questioned whether I would be as touched by this one as it's predecessor. However in the final act of the game, it exceeded my expectations and became a very worthy sequal to a series with limitless potential.\n\nNow onto less emotions and more gameplay. Similar style to \"To the Moon\", much more of an interactive story. Though they did throw in a slightly more complex puzzle system (still not difficult though, however it doesn't need to be) and there are a couple more instances where there is a minor form of \"gameplay\" which was fun in it's own way, allowing a little more variety to my experience playing this game.\n\nI highly recommend this game, especially if you have played To the Moon. If you're new to the series and just browsing, make sure you play To the Moon first.

I don't think you can compare the two when they both pulled off amazing things and they are both gems in their own right. \n\nTo begin with, a basic summary of this game is that there is character that the story is revolved around, Colin, and he is on his deathbed and he hires Sigmund to fulfill his last wish. The thing is, Colin doesn't what he wants for his last wish as he feels like something is missing from his life but doesn't know what, so it is up to the workers of Sigmund, Eva and Dr. Watts, to traverse through his memories and figure it out by themselves. \n\nI really like this game, as a matter of fact, I adored it. \nThere was the silly jokes that made this game and To The Moon so charming.\nBut then there was also the stuff that hit hard, the stuff that makes you emotional, and you have to take a moment and step back and appreciate how well this story is told as it builds this fantasy world that captures your attention and never once lets it go. But that's the beauty of this game, the carefully crafted way that the story is told that produces so many feelings inside of you that you even knew existed.\n\nBut there is so much more that makes this game endearing, so much so that you couldn't possibly describe in words, so do yourself a favour and play this game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1513985928, "timestamp_updated": 1513985928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38553881": {"recommendationid": "38553881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093626669", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 178, "last_played": 1513985283}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't think that I can express all of my emotions using just words. 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1513985398, "timestamp_updated": 1513985398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38553822": {"recommendationid": "38553822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198323239218", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 290, "last_played": 1513984833}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, I can see myself years ago (even now I guess, cause my characteristics haven't changed much since then) in Colin.

They're both story-driven videogames about exploring a dying man's memories to change them in order to grant him his final wish, all done in RPG Maker XP of all things. I love you Kan, but you really gotta move that gear up someday,\n\nWhile we're on the subject, the gameplay is awful. It's about moving your mouse over things hoping that your cursor turns into a magnifying glass icon so that you can make the story go forward ; and you have to do puzzles to move from memory to memory which I feel like I never really fully understood. Moreover, you can't change graphical options of any sort (not that I could find anyway, not like I looked hard) and the game assumes you're using a QWERTY keyboard and not an AZERTY one, which was actually a problem for me and my poor keyboard in some later parts of the game.\n\nYou might have noticed that I'm being harsh on this game. That's because in my eyes, there's little to criticize. Finding Paradise is absolutely amazing and I'm ready to talk about the great stuff, baby. Gaze, Internet Person, as my angry little frown disappears and I shower this game with praise like I shower your mother with one dollar bills on Friday nights.\n\nThe story is absolutely fantastic ; complex, but easy to understand, because it's told extremely well and the pacing is spot-on. The title screen itself managed to draw me in, then the game did not lose my attention for a second, nor did a single yawn escape my mouth. God knows how, since I yawn so much I probably consume twice as much oxygen as everyone else. And it's not because things keep happening and happening ; you're just always curious. What will the next memory be like? It's incredibly pleasant to learn more about Colin, little by little, and you really do get attached to him. If you didn't, which means the game wasn't incredibly human, the whole thing would fall apart.\n\nBecause that's this game's main quality : it's so goddamn full of humanity. The characters feel real and interesting, there's growth to their personalities, and the dialogue feels genuine : the writing is never forced, ever. Moreover, it's all very subtle. Everyone's heard of \"Show, don't tell\", but it feels like so little writers use it in gaming ; well not your boy Kan Gao, since his game is all about showing. You're shown who these characters are, you learn about them through their actions, not boring exposition. All the pieces are set for a very emotional gaming journey.\n\nI've heard many people say, like for To The Moon, that this game has made them cry. It didn't for me personally, but that's mostly because Father fetches the belt if I feel emotions without his consent. Being the sneaky rebel that I am, that didn't stop me from feeling very sad or laughing with the game, and I can say that overall this is a very touching experience that little developers could pull off. \n\nI suppose I also have to mention boring things like the quality of the music and of the pixel art, if I want to be thorough. But that's about it. I just wanted to contribute to that sweet \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" review score this game rightfully deserves.

To the Moon was one of these starring examples. I've been impressed severely by it's amazingly beautiful story and soundtrack... but that was the past... a memory if you will. Finding Paradise: The sequel to a story I had beloved so much. Is it able to hold up against the high expections set by its predecessor?\nThe story revolves around Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts - two scientists whose jobs are to investigate a patient's memories in order to do one last thing for them: fufill their dying wish. Today's patient goes by the name of Colin, who has a wish that is rather... difficult. The story - like that of To the Moon - is well executed. You will be laughing, you will be happy, you will be sad, you will be crying, you will be scared, but you will also be brave. Once again, Freebird - the devs behind this wonderful project - have once again outdone themselves! Finding Paradise is a masterpiece throughout the adventure! The characters are once again are amazing, although I do have a problem with the logic put behind a character near the end (and you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about when you get to it), but I\u2019ll let it happen because it did turn out really good anyways. Now if you didn\u2019t play To the Moon, don\u2019t worry. This game does a good job of catching you up without boring those who have already played the game, however, you will miss some references to To the Moon and apparently Bird Story also has a few references. HOWEVER! I still recomend you go and play To the Moon because you will seriously kick yourself in the face if you don't! You\u2019re also probably wondering if Finding Paradise could possibly ever possibly beat To the Moon\u2019s amazing finale. Believe it or not, the ending is on par with To the Moon, and you will be sobbing once again.\nNow let\u2019s talk gameplay. What happens is that you go around, collecting memory links in order to break momentos. Thankfully, the game does tell you if you\u2019ve missed something and memory links are very obvious, so it shouldn\u2019t be too hard of a task, but it still can be somewhat sluggish considering how slowly the characters move. Then, once a momento is broken, you must solve a puzzle to get past it. The puzzles of this game can be interesting, but they weren\u2019t world breaking or anything. There are also a few mini games near the end that were interesting and kinda fun, but these aren\u2019t the main spotlight of the game. But please don\u2019t let these detract from the main story. These are the minorest of minor complaints, and I really don\u2019t mind.\nAnd now it\u2019s time to talk music. The music - like To the Moon - is really well done. They have all added onto whatever scene is currently playing out really well. Also, Laura Shigihara makes a reappearance for the final song (you know, the one who sung \u201cThere\u2019s a Zombie on Your Lawn\u201d from PVZ or the ever amazing \u201cEverything\u2019s Alright\u201d from To the Moon?), which by the way, you don\u2019t need to worry about. The final song adds soooo much to the end (just like \"Everything's Alright), and I know you\u2019ll love it as well. I\u2019m going to give you a tip: buy the soundtrack but don\u2019t listen to it until you finish the game. You\u2019ll thank me later when you start crying to the end.\nThere\u2019s only one last thing to talk about: graphics. I gotta say, the art style may be the same, but you can tell that it\u2019s gone through several improvements. There are now more expressions, zooming in, and now some objects actually sparkle, providing yet another helpful hint system. The visuals of this game are still good and do a very good job of telling the story.\nIn the end, Finding Paradise turns out to be an extraordinary example of a good experience with its amazing story and soundtrack. Though there are minor problems to be had, they pale in comparison to the story, and I could never let them get in the way. Overall, I loved Finding Paradise. It has managed to do what To the Moon could, even if To the Moon was an unbeatable story.

The immersiveness that an interactive game puts one through places high standards on what one is willing to expect when playing through it.\n\nFreebird's original game/novel To the Moon sets a very high bar in terms of story telling and the emotions it evokes for a simple game, which Finding Paradise once again uses the immersiveness of the video game/visual novel genre to craft an exquisite story\n\nUnderstand that is its MAINLY a story driven game/novel that has puzzle elements imbedded within it.\nthe puzzles are nothing much, taking a few clicks here and there to solve. \nif you are a person looking for a more stimulating puzzle challange without a need for a story then this game/novel is not for you.\n\nfor the bookworms like me, It is an exquisite visual novel, crafted in a fashion that is only achievable via the medium of interaction.\n\nPlacing you in the middle of it all, and having you follow the carefully crafted character creation, it brings together elements of animation, music and interaction to once again craft an unexpecting climax with a bittersweet conclusion.\n\nthe music is fantastically crafted to suit each moment, drawing upon old themes from previous games/novel as well as playing specific tongue-in-cheek jokes.\n\nthis game/novel itself is a roller-coaster ride of emotion, that would perhaps leave one with feelings of bittersweet love at the end of a long journey.\n\nFor those who are looking, savour the time to play this game/novel and do not rush through it. the story itself needs time to sit and sink into you, just like any normal story building a good plot.\n\nOne would have thought that To the Moon has pulled all the punches, and I was feeling rather fearful as to its ability to pull the same sort of emotional heartstrings as the previous game/novel did. But not this story.\n\nTaking elements of the previous game/novel and building upon it, they have manged to craft a new story, plot and climax based on the same universe and some recurring characters.\n\n[spoiler] A question upon one's personal existence, the value that one views for themselves, it is a new take on what one believes to be achievable in their lives and the changes in perspective that they take because of certain events. [/spoiler]\n\nAs a story, I love it for its unique flavour of perspective that it provides, and specific questions that it tries to evoke in the player, just like every good story does.\n\nEnjoy playing through the game/novel, and I hope that you'll be able to find some part of your own personal paradise by answering some of the questions that this game/novel evokes.", "timestamp_created": 1513959577, "timestamp_updated": 1513959577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38539898": {"recommendationid": "38539898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252971317", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 237, "last_played": 1513963300}, "language": "english", "review": "I TELL YOU, this deserved 20/10, the story so good so brilliant and tear jerking \nFor those who experienced To The Moon ansd A Bird Story, for sure already knew how good the sound track and stories, and this Finding Paradise definitely on top of those :\")\n\nFor rich story seekers, Kan Gao creations is a must :)", "timestamp_created": 1513959563, "timestamp_updated": 1513959563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38539778": {"recommendationid": "38539778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123812858", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 491, "last_played": 1513958490}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0437\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0442\u044b", "timestamp_created": 1513959287, "timestamp_updated": 1513959287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38539709": {"recommendationid": "38539709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098687335", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 257, "last_played": 1513958827}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u548c\u53bb\u6708\u7403\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u7b11\u70b9\u5f88\u591a\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u8fd8\u6709\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u73a9\u7740\u73a9\u7740\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u6050\u6016\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\u3002\u3002\n\u4e3b\u9898\u66f2\u548cBGM\u6ca1\u6709\u53bb\u6708\u7403\u7684\u60ca\u8273\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6700\u540e\u8dd1\u9a6c\u706f+BGM\u4e00\u51fa\u8fd8\u662f\u6cea\u6d41\u6ee1\u9762\u3002\n\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u6211\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u600e\u4e48\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u548c\u53bb\u6708\u7403\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u8bdd\u6211\u66f4\u559c\u6b22\u53bb\u6708\u7403\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u6b21\u4f5c\u8005\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5931\u6c34\u51c6\uff0c\u5949\u4e0a\u4e86\u611f\u4eba\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\n\u6700\u540e\u6316\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u5751\u3002\u8bdd\u8bf4\u9a91\u6469\u6258\u8f66\u7684\u4eba\u5230\u5e95\u662f\u8c01\u554a\uff0c\u5230\u6700\u540e\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\u8bf4\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1513959194, "timestamp_updated": 1513959194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38539627": {"recommendationid": "38539627", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970800364", "num_games_owned": 762, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 297, "last_played": 1513957538}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm writing this review really just because I feel like I owe it to the game and the developer, less as an actual recommendation to anyone in particular. If you have not played To the Moon, then you should start with that one. If you have, then you probably already know if you want to play Finding Paradise.\n\nTo the Moon was about a very sad-happy story of two people for the most part. Finding Paradise, while starting with pretty much the same premise, takes a bit of a different direction. It's really not about the people who you interact with in the game, but more about what the game has to say in general about certain aspects of life. As a result, it may not make you cry over the story like To the Moon did, but it may actually have even more lasting implications for your own life. At least it does for me. When I think of the first game, I feel sad while I recap the story of fictional characters in my head. When I'll think of Finding Paradise, I'll probably think of the lessons it taught me about my own life.\n\nI've been playing tons and tons of games for way over 20 years now, and it's really weird to say that one of the best and most important game series is made in RPG Maker of all things. But it's really hard to think about any more meaningful games in my life than Too the Moon and Finding Paradise.\n\nHuge thanks to Kan Gao for his work, I can't wait for the next one in a couple of years.

High expectations mostly mean just falling on your nose.\nBut why oh why did I question Kan Gao? My fear was completely for no reason, because Finding Paradise is equally beautiful as To The Moon was years ago.\nFirst things first: The gameplay is basically the same as in To The Moon. Totally unimportant.\n\nNow to the important parts.\n\nThe graphics are for the most part the same as before. There are a few more parts with extra effects which felt kinda refreshing (and funny). I absolutely adore the graphics since forever, so this was a plus for me.\n\nThe soundtrack is as good as in TTM, maybe even better. I don't know how Kan+Laura do it, but you mostly don't even realise the bgm, you just kinda swim in it. It feels natural for it to be there. And ofcourse Laura went all out and gave us a song which I'm starting to like more then Everything's Alright (please don't hurt me ^^)\n\nThe story... we again jump through a dying man's life to learn about his wishes. And while it is not that emotional this time (still lost it :) ), the story feels more solid and relatable. I really liked all the main characters and understood them. Not understood them as in \"I've heard of Aspergers, oh so they are\", but really understood them. So while the story is not as tragic as in TTM, it hit me harder after my 2nd/3rd time watching it. And it got me really thinking the last few days, I guess I have to re-evaluate some parts of my life. In this regard I wanna Kan Gao for this game from my heart, because games (movies) that change the way you think are the most important ones.\n\nThis game is definately a must play for every To The Moon fan and for everyone else I would just say, you should play both games (+ the extras).\nFor me it could replace To The Moon as my most favorite game of all time. I spent hundreds! of hours on YouTube watching TTM stuff and I have no doubt it will be the same for FP. Until Kan Gao will hit me with his next masterpiece.\n\n\nI [b]highly recommend[/b] to play (or at least watch on YT) the prequel to this one: \"A Bird Story\".\nIt tells one episode out of Colins earlier life, which gives some nice little background to him and makes you understand him more.\n\n\nTLDR:\nThe game is a masterpiece again, could replace TTM as my favorite of all time.\nJust play it!", "timestamp_created": 1513944505, "timestamp_updated": 1513944505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38528825": {"recommendationid": "38528825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271563273", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 146, "last_played": 1513940236}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u719f\u6089\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u65cb\u5f8b\u54cd\u8d77\uff0c\u4fbf\u77e5\u662f\u66fe\u7ecf\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u3002\n\u672c\u4f5c\u6709\u7740\u548c\u300aTo the Moon\u300b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u98ce\u683c\u2014\u2014\u52a0\u5165\u4e86\u4ea4\u54cd\u4e50\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u7136\u52a8\u542c\uff1b\u8bb2\u8ff0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u5bb6\u5ead\u4e0e\u4eba\u751f\u3001\u5b64\u72ec\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u7684\u597d\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\n[spoiler]\u751f\u547d\u4e2d\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u53ef\u6b63\u662f\u4ed6\u4eec\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u62e5\u6709\u4e86\u73b0\u5728\u7684\u3001\u72ec\u4e00\u65e0\u4e8c\u7684\u4e00\u5207\u3002[spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1513944108, "timestamp_updated": 1513944298, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38528192": {"recommendationid": "38528192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148323703", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1513943101}, "language": "english", "review": "First off, I'm a college student with $35,000 student loan debt, with literally only $21 dollar in my bank account. I am currently jobless, because I am studying full time.  I was a huge fan of To the Moon, and when i heard the sequal finally came out, i was so excited i couldn't hardly wait. But given my financial situation, I had to resort to torrenting. \n\nI finished the game. It's 3am in the morning, and i bought this game on steam with half of my entire fortune just to write this review.  So you better know that im serious.\n\nKan Gao.  I don't know if you read steam reviews, but if you do ever come across my review, I just want to say Thank you. And i am ashamed of torrenting this masterpiece. \n\nI apologize for the poor english in this review.\n\nI have not yet heard anyone saying this: This game is relatable. And I'm not talking in metaphor, I'm talking literally relatable. Once upon a time, I too once had similar experience.  Back in Korea when i was 8 years old, I was a lonely little kid who had no friends, and I resort to my imagination to escape from reality and loneliness. One day while i was walking home from school, i stumbled upon a dragonfly with broken wings..  I took this dragonfly home and made him into my friend. I would take him to my make-belief fantasy world and we would be going through adventures together. \n\nOne day, this dragonfly died... He was my first and only friend.  Although he no longer existed physically, I turned him into my imaginary friend with the remaining memories i had of him.  I imagined him to be a half boy half dragonfly who was around my age. We would talk to each other causally. My entire elementary to middle school experience was only memories of me playing with my dragonfly friend alone in the corner.  He was there for me when i was being bullied. He was there for me when i was eating alone in an empty classroom. He was there for me when nobody picked me to be in their team when there was a soccor practice.  He was one true friend that comforted me in time of loneliness and depression. He taught me to be strong and be positive about life.\n\nHighschool came. I started making real friends. I spent less and less time with my dragonfly friend.  I start to realize that everything i experienced and learned from my dragonfly friend was from myself.  But i didn't want to let go of him... I learned to be a strong person because of him.  It's because of him that I was able to embrace the reality and make real friends.  But as time goes by, i knew i eventually had to let him go... We promised each other that we will see again one day... Perhaps once i graduate from college and find a job, i will meet him again and tell him all about my life.\n\nHowever, i soon learned the cruelty of adulthood.  Your imagination isn't as strong as when you were young. I realized that once i let go of him, there was no getting him back.  There are few times i wanted to talk to him again, but my imagination only created a dull empty version of my dragonfly friend.  It was definately not the same...  I wanted to tell him of my current situation; both hardships and happiness i experienced... But I can only confirm that he is gone forever and i can never get him back.  \n\nKan Gao, i don't know if this is the similar experience you had. I dont think i've ever heard of a story so personal that it pierced through my heart and gave me flashback of my dragonfly friend.  When i tell this story to my family or friends (i even wrote stories about this in my english class), nobody understood me.  I thought nobody in the world can understand the strong emotion i had over non-existing friend.  I went nuts and cried so much while playing this game. \n\nSPOILER: [spoiler] I was looking around everywhere but i haven't seen anyone mention about this: I thought Faye was obviously the bird from A Bird Story (which explains the wings she had that covered Colin when he was about to let go of her). That part had me crying like crazy because that was the part that gave me all the flash back about my dragonfly friend. [/spoiler] \n\nThank you again Kan Gao. Thank you so much. I realized even though i lost my close friend, I am not alone in this world. You have given me inspiration to move on and not give up at the current situation i am in.  I don't know if my message will get to you... And i really hope it does. I am also very curious whether this is based on your personal story, as it is so scarily close to mine.", "timestamp_created": 1513943114, "timestamp_updated": 1514406908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 361, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.949565", "comment_count": "35", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38527690": {"recommendationid": "38527690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198350436774", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 210, "last_played": 1513941682}, "language": "english", "review": "Some monents,my tear in my face.it's break me from my heart", "timestamp_created": 1513942153, "timestamp_updated": 1513942153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38527511": {"recommendationid": "38527511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082072421", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 298, "last_played": 1513941212}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoyed To the Moon, you're pretty much guaranteed to like this game.

If u r alrdy considering on buying this game (which i urge u to do!), I highly encourage u to go play \"a bird story\" beforehand if u hvnt. I only made the connection between the 2 games when I was about to reach the ending (since I played that game quite a while back) and it made it all the more bittersweet. The plot wasn't dramatic like \"to the moon\" was but it told its simplistic story in such a beautiful and relatable yet deep manner that it might take a while to understand what was going on in Colin's mind at first glance (which is what happened to me\ud83d\ude02). I spent time thinking about the story even after the credits rolled and the more I thought, the more I felt impressed with the subtle storytelling elements the game had. I honestly think this game gets better after multiple playthroughs since u'd get to understand the characters a lot more in that way.\n\nThe only complaints I had with the game was that particular memories were too short so I cudnt really immerse myself in the situation enough since it changed scenes too fast (tho it might hv been done intentionally in relation to [spoiler] Colin focusing too much on his regrets [/spoiler] and tho the [spoiler] Faye vs Neil [/spoiler] scenes were hilarious, they were too overplayed and I wish it cudve been more dramatic. But honestly, they're pretty small personal nitpicks and shudn't affect ur opinion on the overall story and message of the game. I still think the game was amazing with how it pulled off its storytelling!\n\nOverall, this game was certainly a worthy successor to \u201cto the moon\u201d. It was an emotional game that had a great message which I think a lot of ppl would be able to relate to and it definitely left a very huge impression on me. Oh, and the music was so heartwrenchingly beautiful, kan gao and laura r such masters with their art! I certainly can\u2019 t wait for the 3rd game and thank u so much to freebird games for making this unforgettable masterpiece! \n\nP.S.

Even with To the Moon, I [i]felt[/i] sad, but didn't cry.\n\nBut this game broke me. \n\nThe game is practically everything a good follow-up game should be, and then some. The one thing I liked so much about To the Moon was how small the story was - which sounds weird, but it seemed like the main focus, in that game, was kept to two people just doing their job. Finding Paradise also keeps the focus on the patient and his life, but also starts to address some additional outer plot points encountered in the minisodes and heck, even at the end. It gives you a wonderful story and still leaves you waiting eagerly for the next release. \n\nAlso, the banter between everyone was just fantastic. The chemistry between Neil and Eva is impeccable, as are Neil's humourous intentions. And some scary imagery, too! [spoiler]Faye with the blacked out eyes, mouth and tentacles...[/spoiler]\n\nIt seems as though this game does give you enough information that you don't have to play To the Moon first before playing this game. I do, however, recommend doing so, along with the minisodes, if possible. With A Bird Story, yes, this main character is the patient (don't think I'm giving anything away there), though unlike To the Moon and this, doesn't really have a lot of gameplay and no dialogue at all. I actually really did like A Bird Story, but after playing Finding Paradise, I do appreciate it more. It's not absolutely necessary to play A Bird Story to understand what's going on in Finding Paradise, but it might help to set things up in terms of the plot. [i]Or maybe just leave you with more questions...[/i] \n\nOne thing I would mention that I didn't like is that I was experiencing a pretty low framerate for a good portion of the game. There's quite a few more instances of control-heavy moments in Finding Paradise that were very hard to control due to this. Switching to the beta \"alternative\" seems to aid in a smoother, more fluid performance, though. \n\nMan it was hard to put this game down. I almost stayed up the entire night to finish this.

The game does a great job of building suspense between each jump in memory and does it in a way that keeps you wanting to figure out whats going to happen next. \n\nThe graphics are very simplistic but this is done with the intention to keep the focus on the story. Even though they are simple, they are very clean and do a good job of painting a picture for the story (Although there are a few scenes that did catch me by surprise of how well they were done).\n\nGameplay does a good job of keeping the player engaged but with this being centered aroud the story, don't expect too much(although it does take a step up from the last episode in a few parts). \n\nThe music in this game really fits the mood of each scene and is well written. It's completely new music from the first episode but listening through it, I feel as if it incorporates elements from the music of To The Moon(not too much though). This gives it an overall reminiscent feel of the first episode while still remaining original to this story(if that makes sense). \n\nOverall, I've been a fan of Kan Gao since To The Moon, and Finding Paradise did a great job of living up to my expectations. His ability write great stories and develop them into a game and then to compose great music tailored around each specific scene is incredible. There's only two games that have actually made me cry and those are To The Moon and this game. Kan Gao will continue to be on my list of favorites and I will continue to support him throughout the entire series.

Been a long time since I cried at anything but as the final scene ended and the credits rolled I couldn't hold back a few. \n\nThe biggest issue (as it was with To The Moon) is the comic relief that is Niel and (to a lesser extent) Eva. When the characters are being serious they're the perfect protagonists for such a story, but then you get touching scenes bookended by them being funny, and on more than one occasion it brought me out of the moment.\n\nApart from them, the game perfectly achieves everything I hoped it would and more. Highly reccomended to anyone even if this is their first entry into the series. I look forward to episode three.

Who wouldn't want to see more of Eva and Watts? No one, that's who.\n\n[b] - Want their fictional selves humoured anyway:[/b]\n\nThis game isn't like To The Moon, not quite. However, I felt like Finding Paradise is the perfect sequel. Without spoiling too much, I can say that the game takes a very different direction from TTM, and explores a very different human psyche. As much as our dreams are varied, and our experiences different, so is this game different from the last one. The outcome is absolutely beautiful. While TTM is a dream, Finding Paradise is reality. And yet, it deals with things that are more.. imaginary. It is the perfect complement to TTM, hence the perfect sequel. Kudos, Kan! TTM was an incredibly tough act to follow, but you came through with flying colours.\n\nThe gameplay is much the same (with a couple of surprises), and the humour and charm of the original is sprinkled throughout. The plot twists might be a little more predictable (maybe because we are more prepared for the unexpected this time), but it doesn't take away from the narrative strength. And if you're experiencing stuttering/FPS drops, take a look at the Discussions page, which tells you how to switch to a version that should fix it.\n\nTl;dr: It's a beautiful story, well worth 5 hours of your time.

Und ich wurde definitiv nicht entt\u00e4uscht.\n\nDie Grafik ist wie bei den anderen Teilen eine nette, bunte Pixelgrafik mit liebevollen Details, die eine wundervolle Atmosph\u00e4re zaubern.\nDer Soundtrack ist wieder ganz gro\u00dfe Klasse! Die Lieder sind einfach wundersch\u00f6n komponiert und f\u00fcgen sich mit ihren sanften, aber niemals nervigen Melodien super in das Spielgeschehen ein ohne auch nur einmal zu nerven!\nUnd die Story... Ich will gar nicht zu viel verraten, aber sie ist wieder vollgepackt mit lustigen Spr\u00fcchen der Protagonisten, netten Hints auf andere Spiele, vielen Punkten zum Nachdenken und Gr\u00fcbeln, sowie reichlich Tr\u00e4nenpotential (was ich gegen Ende des Spiels auch voll ausgekostet habe :) ).\nDas \"Gameplay\" ist gleichzusetzen mit dem der Vorg\u00e4nger. Es ist eigentlich eher ein interaktiver Pixelfilm als ein Spiel. Zwar steuert man die Charaktere durch die Welt und muss ab und zu ein kleines R\u00e4stel l\u00f6sen, aber der Hauptaugenmerk liegt darauf, der wundersch\u00f6n erz\u00e4hlten Geschichte zu lauschen.\n\nIch habe das Spiel in 8 Stunden durchgespielt (und habe etwas l\u00e4nger gebraucht, weil ich versucht habe, es simultan aus dem Englischen ins Deutsche f\u00fcr einen Stream zu \u00fcbersetzen) und w\u00fcrde es jederzeit wieder tun :)\n\nKleine Anmerkung von mir: Es lohnt sich definitiv \"A Bird Story\" vorher gespielt zu haben, da das Spiel \u00f6fters auf die Kurzgeschichte referenziert!

This game in my opinion is overall amazing, it is definitely a worth successor of to the moon. The storyline and dialogue is extremely well crafted in my opinion, to the point where i got really teary eyed. The soundtrack is another thing Kan Gao needs to be praised for. It follows a similar style of to the moon with reusing some of the soundtrack from certain areas in others, if you played or watched to the moon, you will understand certain references to the game. It can be said that Kan Gao is just reusing the soundtrack from the other game cause he is lazy or because he wants to reference to his older game. Everybody has a different perspective, but this game honestly is worth the money i personally spent on it. If you are looking for a story game with great soundtrack, DO NOT hesitate to buy this. \n\ni\u2019m gonna stop wasting your people\u2019s time, thanks for reading my review.

interested but don't speak italian)\n\nDopo To The Moon (che considero uno dei giochi pi\u00f9 belli a cui abbia mai giocato), e la sua emozionante storia d\u2019amore in questo capitolo verr\u00e0 affrontata una storia molto pi\u00f9 matura, che metter\u00e0 a dura prova i nostri dottori preferiti, Eva e Neil, che avranno a che fare con un paziente molto singolare, Colin, il quale ha un desider- oh, sto correndo troppo? \n\nScusate. Per chi non conosce le basi di questo gioco, c\u2019\u00e8 un\u2019associazione chiamata Sigmund Corp. che ha inventato una macchina capace di alterare i ricordi di una persona che sta per morire, in modo tale da realizzare il suo pu\u00f2 grande desiderio ed eliminare i possibili rimorsi della vita vissuta. \n\nDunque, dove eravamo? Ah si, Colin. Il desiderio di Colin \u00e8 \u201csemplicemente\u201d di essere felice. Colin ha avuto una bella vita, \u00e8 sposato ed ha un figlio. Tutto sembra essere normale. Allora, come mai ha contattato la Sigmund? Che cosa nasconde in realt\u00e0? Tocca a noi scoprirlo. Il giocatore dovr\u00e0 navigare nei ricordi di Colin per scoprire che cosa non va, e cercare di realizzare il suo desiderio, viaggiando nella vita del paziente finch\u00e9 egli \u00e8 ancora in vita.\n\nQuesto capolavoro realizzato da Ken Gao, provocher\u00e0 al giocatore tante risate ma anche tanti momenti di riflessione, di gioia, di tristezza e anche di tante lacrime in alcuni (me compresa, lo ammetto).\n\nIn questo seguito, si tratteranno argomenti come la solitudine, il bisogno di un amico ed il desiderio di comunicare, che non sempre \u00e8 una cosa facile nella vita di alcune persone. Sar\u00e0 molto facile immedesimarsi nel paziente, perch\u00e9 tutti noi abbiamo dei rimorsi, e tutti noi ci siamo sentiti soli almeno una volta nella vita. E questo render\u00e0 il gioco ancora pi\u00f9 interessante ed emozionante per tutti noi. \n\nI due dottori saranno elettrizzanti e molto divertenti come sempre, ma ancora una volta la cosa che mi ha colpito di pi\u00f9 in questo gioco (oltre alla storia fantastica ovviamente) \u00e8 la musica, ma chi ha gi\u00e0 giocato il capitolo precedente sa bene cosa intendo. Senza di essa, si perderebbe met\u00e0 della magia del gioco.\n\nSe volete acquistare questo gioco, consiglio vivamente di giocare a To the Moon e A Bird Story prima, per avere una visione completa di questo gioco, e dei prossimi che ci saranno.\n\nCos\u2019altro dire.\n\nGiocateci, amici. Lo consiglio veramente, se volete vivere una storia molto intensa che vi far\u00e0 emozionare.\n\nVoto 9.5/10\n\n---------------\n\nAnd now, for my english speaking friends, a translation for you:\n\nAfter To The Moon (which I consider one of the most beautiful games I've ever played), and its exciting love story, in this chapter a much more mature story will be tackled, which will put a strain on our favorite doctors, Eva and Neil, who will have to deal with a very singular patient, Colin, who has a wish- oh, am I running too fast?\n\nSorry. For those unfamiliar with the basics of this game, there is an association called Sigmund Corp. which invented a machine capable of altering the memories of a dying person, so as to realize his great desire and eliminate every possible remorse of the lived life.\n\nSo where were we? Ah yes, Colin. Colin's desire is \"simply\" to be happy. Colin has had a good life, is married and has a son. Everything seems to be normal. So, why did he contact Sigmund? What does he hide in reality? It's up to us to find out. The player will have to navigate Colin's memories to find out what's wrong, and try to fulfill his desire by traveling through the patient's life while he is still alive.\n\nThis masterpiece made by Ken Gao, will cause the player many laughter but also many moments of reflection, joy, sadness and also many tears in some (including myself, I admit).\n\nIn this follow-up, topics such as loneliness, the need for a friend and the desire to communicate, which is not always an easy thing in the lives of some people, will be discussed. It will be very easy to identify with the patient, because we all have remorses, and we all felt lonely at least once in our life. And this will make the game even more interesting and exciting for all of us.\n\nThe two doctors will be electrifying and very funny as always, but again the thing that struck me most in this game (in addition to the fantastic story of course) is the music, but who has already played the previous chapter knows what I mean. Without it, you would lose half the magic of the game.\n\nIf you want to buy this game, I highly recommend to play To the Moon and A Bird Story first, to have a complete view of this game, and the next ones that will be there.\n\nWhat else to say.\n\nPlay this game, friends. I really recommend it if you want to live a very intense story that will excite you.\n\nRated 9.5 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1513771147, "timestamp_updated": 1513771217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up":

It isn't quite as much of a tear-jerker for me as To the Moon was, but your mileage will probably vary; plus, \"slightly less sad than To the Moon\" is still pretty darn sad.\n\nPOTENTIAL MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD: [spoiler] I did like this one's twist better than To the Moon's. It really emphasizes the theme of coping with loneliness that both this and To the Moon are largely about, while To the Moon's twist was mostly just going for shock value. It's also a lot more cleverly hinted at than To the Moon's twist, pulling some Sixth Sense level writing tricks to dangle it right in front of you without giving it away. Plus, where To the Moon used its twist to explain all the previously obscure plot details and character motivations, this uses its twist as a turning point, taking the plot in a very unexpected but very welcome direction.

It had a previous game linked to it called A Bird Story, that introduces us to our new protagonist Colin, but it's not necessary to play that game (although it's great for how short it is). We have a much more elaborate story with the new patient, we have a more in depth subplot with what has been going on with Watts, the humor is even better, the characters are fantastic.

(the pills, and how he feels like he needs them) at the end of to the moon, everyone was wondering what was up with neil. its been somewhat confirmed that he uses pills to cope with some sort of tremor or ache that he has. it's also strange with his development of the machine. why would he do it? and why is he so secretive? we don't know. this is why neil is a very big focus point in the game, without being the center. \n\nin regards to the story of this game, i think that it exceeds a bird story pretty easily (although it is a very good game), considering it's basically a direct sequel to it depending how you look at it (and the actually length) . when it compared with to the moon, in my opinion, was a lot more psychologically understandable. \n\nthinking about colin and his potential schizophrenia (?) was a little harder to comprehend than river's asperger's syndrome.\n\nwhen coursing back and forward through colins memories, it was easy to make assumptions about faye and sofia, whether one of them were out of place; and how faye suddenly just leaves once sofia joins the picture. which could also lead to a bunch of theories about why she felt like her time was done, and why she didnt return. (maybe due to colin no longer feeling alone- after talking about sofia to faye)\n\nthere's also the fact that on the balcony, faye asked when colin was going to finish 'the story' and 2 parts of the story can be found during the game (only the obvious places if there are any that i walked by) since the pages were blank in his book, i still do wonder if he finished the story but in lemon juice- which is also hinted towards the end, when they heat the pages with sofia.\n\nmoving away from the theories and such, i really did enjoy this game in all of it's hours, for the amount of time i've waited, i really think this worth every month. i also wish that it wasn't on sale. i want to be able to buy this game for it's intended price, because that's literally what it deserves. \n\nthe soundtrack was amazing as usual- the remakes of some of the songs in cello made me so happy, it felt nostalgic. im also extremely hyped that laura shigihara did another song for this series.  whenever there's a lyrical piece in the game, it's always so emotional, and fitting to the moment. in this case, the song connected to colins situation perfectly. i wasn't able to understand how something 4 minutes long could summarise something i'd been searching for in a game for 5+ hours. colin's 'regrets' \n\nagain, i love this game so much. and i'm so freaking happy that this came out. all of my support goes out to freebird and their work. good job my dudes", "timestamp_created": 1513720944, "timestamp_updated": 1513720944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38439517": {"recommendationid": "38439517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058551523", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 332, "last_played": 1513737964}, "language": "english", "review": "Thanks Kan Gao for doing it again.", "timestamp_created": 1513719810, "timestamp_updated": 1513719810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38439307": {"recommendationid": "38439307", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965628221", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 213, "last_played": 1513718713}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Brillante.

There are playful little nods and references to previous games in the series that if you happen to be playing this one first, you might be lost on 1 or 2 of the comments but it's nothing severe. The soundtrack is, of course, very pleasant. There were several moments in the story where I didn't want to progress solely because of how good the music was for that particular segment. And without delving too deeply into spoiler territory, the story does a pretty good job at presenting its morals and themes without feeling too heavy handed. \n\nIf you enjoy story driven games and really like good music, I really recommend FP (as well as its predecessors).

Control and Gameplay : using some basic movement (walk using arrow or ASDW, menu is X and choices made using C). So far I haven't found the \"Option\" for the game key rebinding. There is several game mode included, making it a little more interactive than the usual story- based rpg games. The only downside is that the characters move pretty slow (there is no run button?)\n\n2. Fun Factor : for me, personally it has to be the graphic and the interface system. The tiniest details is drawn very carefully and every single action for the characters is noticeable. The story is great (especially if you expect heartwarming stories). Also one thing that worth mentioned is the music. While rarely I spot bad music for games, this one is nice (there will be free dlc for the OST).\n\n3. Graphic : This might be of personal sentiment but, I find these kind of pixel art is amusing. It feels so nostalgic compared to the sleek look of 3D's. Also the tiny details make me smitten at times. The interface is so simple and easy to learn.\n\n4. Replayability Value : unless you want to enjoy the music and the good scenes from this game, then no. Too bad the story has no branch and no real Steam achievement (you only get one for finishing the game). This kind of story offers no replayability value for me because, very deep and memorable ones already carved in my minds, so...\n\n5. Sound : the music is good and nostalgic, it puts the story and feeling in tunes. Can't say more, but without the music, the story might have less impact for me.\n\n6. Story : people who are hired to help some old man fullfill his last wish through his own memories. There is some sci-fi ish theme in the story, makes it quite unique.\n\n7. Value for Full Price : to support the great developers out there, why not? I got this one as a Christmas gift from my friend and I really am grateful to know this one game. There is complexity in both the game design and gameplay, so it will worth for a full price.\n\n8. Others : I want to try the prequels now.\n\nTested with:\nAcer Aspire E1 -471G\n1366 x 768/ Windows 7/ 64-Bit\nIntel Core i3 2348M (2.3 GHz)\nNVIDIA GeForce 710 M (1GB VRAM)\n4GB DDR3 RAM\n\nThank you

"italian", "review": "L'attesissimo seguito di To the Moon, che ci riporta alle vicende della Sigmund Co. e al topos del viaggio all'interno della mente del paziente, al fine di realizzare -sia pure a livello meramente illusorio- il suo ultimo desiderio prima di morire,\n\nCome in To the Moon, anche Finding paradise \u00e8 un gioco dal gameplay quasi assente, che punta tutto sulla storia che rasenta la perfezione in quanto a seriet\u00e0 e profondit\u00e0 di trattamento di temi tutt'altro che banali, stemperati da momenti \"leggeri\" sparsi ovunque -ma in modo sempre equilibrato che non getta mai il gioco nel grottesco- all'interno delle varie fasi di gioco. \n\nIn sostanza, questo gioco strappa molti sorrisi, alcune risate, molte lacrime (nel mio caso, meno che per To the moon) e soprattutto innesta una serie di riflessioni sul senso della nostra esistenza, e della fuggevolezza del tempo, che scorre inesorabile e ci porta in un baleno dalla fanciullezza alla vetust\u00e0.\n\nA mio avviso, si tratta del titolo migliore che questo 2017 ci abbia offerto: dopotutto, non capita spesso di trovare titoli di cos\u00ec grande impatto emotivo che evitano di cadere nei clich\u00e9 pi\u00f9 banali o nel ridicolo!\n\nTutto \u00e8 impreziosito dalla colonna sonora meravigliosa a cura di Kan Gao e di Laura Shigihara, anche qui (parere mio) non all'altezza della soundtrack di To the Moon, ma pur sempre meravigliosa e sempre in linea con le atmosfere dei vari passaggi del gioco: indispensabile l'ascolto da un buon impianto o ancor meglio in cuffia, per goderne appieno!\n\nConsiglio a chi volesse lanciarsi nell'impresa, di condurre la maratona giocando tutti i vari titoli tra loro collegati nel seguente ordine:\n\n1)A bird's story; \n2)To the Moon;\n3)To the Moon - Minisode 1;\n4)To the Moon - Minisode 2;\n5)Finding Paradise.\n\nRicordate che parliamo di un gioco indie, che in quanto a trama tiene testa -anzi, a mio modesto avviso sorpassa di gran lunga- la trama di quasi tutti i giochi \"tripla A\" fino ad ora usciti sul mercato!\n\nConsigliatissimo!", "timestamp_created": 1513685909, "timestamp_updated": 1513685909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5,

What do we get? Something actually very good but not on par with its predecessor. To the Moon had a story that was truely made you care about the main character but also the spouse of that main character that we find has shaped his life in so many ways. The affects of this character on the main characters fate is what makes us so sad when the main character (not really a spoiler) dies. This is not the case for the second game. The main character in this story is potraid as a dreamer. It makes the character pretty uninteresting for the first 1/3 to 1/2 of the game. Not only that but the implications of a girl that he liked in his childhood that we think is the cause of his modern day sorrow caused me to even look at him like he was selfish, just a bit. Of course in the \"twist\" this is turned on its head. but in a way that is so bizare and wierd that it is kind of hard to even relate to the main character.\n\nThat being said the humour, the music, the soft moments are all there. In the end it makes for a good story, but not one that creates feeling of sadness. What kind of saddness am I talking about? If you ever loved a story so much that when it concluded you cried, that is the sadness I am talking about. But I did not experience that here. I was very pleased and content.  But, I did not yearn for more.\n\nOne last thing, the music. The music is beautiful but takes TOOO much inspiration from the previous game.

I like how Colin's wish is handled and how unorthodox his last request is. I enjoyed seeing how the smaller seeming moments added up in his life, as well as the little regrets of things that he may have wished could have gone better. It made his story more resonant and relatable. I honestly wish a greater emphasis was placed on this, even though there was already a great emphasis on it in the game.\n\nIt does seem misleading to say that this is a standalone game. While you technically would be able to play the game and understand the story without playing either To the Moon, the Minisodes, or A Bird Story, there are references to them or plot points that they brought up that are so blatant and difficult to ignore that this game might run the risk of being confusing to completely new players. That being said, I absolutely enjoyed the references to A Bird Story, even though that game did not do much for me on its own. It was a sweet and heartfelt touch for this game.\n\nThe pop-culture references were my least favorite part of To the Moon, and it seems as though there were more added in Finding Paradise. When the playstyle shifted in these moments, it felt so jarring that it sucked me out of the experience. However, the mechanics themselves were not bad in and of themselves. They just felt disracting to me as a part of this particular game.\n\nThe ending is where I have the most problems. The spoiler in this section is fairly detailed about important reveals toward the end of the game, so I advise that you don't read it if you are already planning to play Finding Paradise. [spoiler] I had suspected that the faded person that was in Colin's later memories had something to do with Faye, but I had thought that they had drifted apart or that she moved away, and that rift needed to be solved somehow by the end. When the records showed that Faye didn't exist, I immediately jumped to schizophrenia, which would have been interesting and possibly have explained a lot about everything that had occurred in the game. Unfortunately, when the character's bring this theory up, it is immediately dismissed in favor of the true cause of everything: Faye was an imaginary friend so complex as to have a consciousness of her own that appears to be separate from Colin's. While developing an imaginary friend to cope with stress does happen, that isn't the same as creating a separate conscious entity. The explanation of the modification of the device can only go so far. I also disagree with Dr. Watts's speech toward the end, but that may say more about my thoughts than about the actual game. [/spoiler] I'm sure some people could either suspend disbelief at these parts or just not think as much about them in general, but it was a problem for me and my enjoyment of many of the ending portions of this game. It also sucked a lot of the emotion out of the end of Colin's story that I feel could have otherwise left me in tears.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing, as it was with the other games before it. It was beautifully composed, and it is a pleasure to hear throughout this game. I will buy the soundtrack in a heatrbeat once they have that option here.\n\nThe game itself can run slowly at times, though I don't remember any significant moments of lag that hurt the overall experience of the game.\n\nIn spite of it's flaws, I do not regret having played this game. I played through it from start to finish with only an occasional restroom break getting in the way of one long continuous play. I look forward to to seeing whatever new game Kan Gao comes up with next for this series.\n\n[b] TL;DR [/b]\nI don't think this is a great game, and your mileage may vary with some plot points and pop-culture references, but I am glad I played it and reccomend it to others.

Finding Paradise is very similar to To the Moon gameplay and graphics wise, for better or for worse. Soundtrack is wonderfully exceptional, as expected; there are some scores from Finding Paradise that I prefer to To the Moon, and vice versa. Overall verdict for soundtrack is comparable to To the Moon if not better. Story wise, how to begin, is phenomenally exceptional. Probably one of if not the best narrative in video game I have ever witnessed, again, comparable if not better than To the Moon in terms of narration and story telling. This game will hit your feels, hard, and relentlessly.\n\nThey included some references to To the Moon and A Bird Story in the game; it is a completely standalone game but I would recommend playing those 2 if you care so much for references. I did not play the 2 minisodes and I think there are some references to those as well.\n\n(SPOILER BELOW)\n\nThis game deals with loneliness, childhood fantasy, regret, \"what ifs\", and other complex emotions really well. Just as To the Moon dealt with being in a relationship with someone in the autism spectrum (I imagine, haven't actually had the experience) really well, Finding Paradise will hit your feels hard even if you can't relate to it 100%. The details they put in the game regarding the lack of key memories from his latter life that is not in sync with the photo album is amazing. They do not really display all of the emotions that they want to convey in your face, but they are still presented very elegantly and very clearly, it was clear that even after living a long and full life, Colin still had difficulty appreciating life as it is, even if he is \"not as aloof\" as he was. In the end, what Faye did by (what I imagine to be) changing his core memories from his fantasised memories with her to his actual memories regarding his family is brilliant, and hits the home. Too often we disregard what is going on in our everyday life as we are too obsessed with our fantasies. This game teaches a valuable lesson about life in that regard, and I can see myself returning to this game every so often and pick up new lessons from it.\n\nThe subplot regarding Neil is equally interesting, and leaves you wanting more. In To the Moon, we were presented with the information that Neil keeps a bottle of painkillers, but we didn't know if they were prescribed or if he is addicted. In this game, we learned a little bit more about Neil, but nothing concrete can be drawn from him yet. We also learned a little bit more about his relationship with Eva (they have been friends since childhood), which is really nice. I would really love to learn more about Eva as she is an equally intriguing character, but sadly we don't learn much about her here. However, the cliffhanger at the end about Neil leaves me screaming for answers, good job Kan Gao.", "timestamp_created": 1513616160, "timestamp_updated": 1513616160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

Simply cause of how simple and small it is yet made me feel like no other game ever did. Bawled my eyes out over it. I expected no less of this game and Kan Gao delivered again. Did I bawl my eyes out as much as last time? No, but the experience was just as emotional and touching as To the Moon. Games that stir your emotions with beautiful writing and a wonderful story really deserve so much more praise. Not only is it emotional but just as funny. I laughed out loud so many times. The characters are so well written and you get invested in no time. The small multiple gameplay elements and references are as charming as always. Kan Gao is a genius and I can't wait to play the third installment of this series. Thank you so much for a great experience that will stay with me.

my life away\" (from the Finding Paradise Soundtrack)\nby laura shigihara \n\n(verse 1)\nI never stood up very tall\nI think my voice was fairly small\nBut there were times I'd wanna to shout\nThough my thoughts weren't sorted out\nSo I'd stumble and I'd fall\n\nI learned to fly because of you\nSo if you left, I could go too\nAnd everything you saw in me\nThat's what I wanted to be\nDid I make it after all?\n\n(chorus)\nAll the grass on the other side\nIs it only greener in my mind?\nI'd still want it same\nBecause trading my yesterday\nis to wish my life away\n\n(verse 2)\nAs we dream and as we grow\nWe have to learn to let things go\nBut let the wonder never fade\nThough we've turned 10,000 pages\nFlying high or stuck below\n\nI've searched for meaning amidst doubt\nI've finally figured that part out\nAnd all the stories inside me\nFeels like I'm bursting at the seams\nAnd you're here after all\n\n(chorus repeat)", "timestamp_created": 1513591018, "timestamp_updated": 1513751650,

It\u2019s there for as much as it needs to be, gently pulling in anyone experiencing it. Colin\u2019s plot may be the main focus, however the two doctors get their fair share of dialogue as well. On top of being an emotional experience, Finding Paradise also steps into cerebral, contemplative territory. Despite attempting some variety, the gameplay and visuals don\u2019t stand out too much. The great thing about it is that they don\u2019t impede the narrative either, as I quickly found myself invested in and caring about the life story of a bunch of fairly standard-looking pixel sprites. It\u2019s this brilliant mixture of wonderful music and touching narrative that made To The Moon a game I can recommend to anyone.

The story is more on the weird and creepy side, the tone can be a little bit inconsistent. The game play is still almost non-existent, but if you are considering this game you are probably ready for that.\n\nThat being said, not many games can compare to To the Moon, and this game is one of the best games I've played this year. Soundtrack is amazing as always, story telling is intriguing, art is great for the its low-res format, ending will surely make you shed a tear. As for the overall story, while kind of weird, still delievers something for you to think about for a long time.\n\nThe game ended on a cliff-hanger.

The story in this one is decent, and at times touching, but in my opinion To the Moon set the bar so impossibly high that there was never really any hope that a sequel could top(or even match) it. So that's my suggestion: maybe play A Bird Story first, but definitely save To the Moon for *after* you've played this if you haven't done so already so that you don't go in with impossible expectations.\n\nSecond, this and the events of the two Chrismas DLCs for To the Moon have caused me to hate - and I mean utterly detest - one of the main characters, as well as a prominent side character. [spoiler]Dr. Watts is making unlicensed modifications to the memory machine, and those changes are strongly hinted to have contributed to some of the weirder events that take place in FP, mostly by leaving the OS open to attack from the patient's own mental processes. He has *not* disclosed this to his partner, Dr. Rosalene, who's also using the machine, so he's literally placing her mind and health at risk for \"mysterious reasons.\" One of their coworkers - Winters - knows something about this, and she hasn't disclosed anything to Rosalene either, so she's complicit,[/spoiler]\n\nOther than that, I have no objections. Great original soundtrack, great use of pixel art, fun(if simplistic) explore and find adventure gameplay.

In addition to being part of the overarching plot, the minisodes provide both important background on how some things came to be as well as some character introductions.  \n\nThe game's premise is very similar: a call to a dying patient.  This patient, Colin, has an unconventional wish to [spoiler]die with no regrets, while also changing none of the major aspects of his life[/spoiler].  Eva and Neil navigate through Colin's memories in a mechanically similar way to To the Moon, but [spoiler]instead of following a linear path from recent memories to old memories, the memories constantly slingshot across his life[/spoiler].  Neil has some secrets that are discovered, and he struggles to keep them under control.  \n\nFinding Paradise is significantly less depressing than To the Moon.  The heavy-hitting emotions arrive near the end, where everything is coming together and Colin is in his final moments, but the story isn't as tragic as Johnny's.  I do not see this in any way as a bad thing- it's a different game, different person, and not every life has to be tragic.  The comedy in this game is arguably better, as I found myself laughing pretty hard in some sequences.  With great art and music old, new, and remixed, the atmosphere in this game easily matches that of To the Moon.\n\nMechanically, this game is very similar to To the Moon.  You can either play in a small window or fullscreen.  The launch menu is identical, just with different music and art.  The controls are nearly the same, with some sequences requiring keyboard control.  In any interaction, always try to exhaust the dialogue; just because they stopped talking does not mean they don't have more to say.  I believe it is better to play with a mouse, because you will be able to find interactable components that you wouldn't find with keyboard controls.\n\nTry not to expect the same thing as To the Moon.  If you play this game expecting to feel emotionally ruined at the end, you may be disappointed.  In fact, this game is much more optomistic.  Johnny died with a life made happy, which was bittersweet because in reality, he was a very tragic man.  Colin, on the other hand was already content, he just wanted to have no regrets.", "timestamp_created": 1513565239, "timestamp_updated": 1513565287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38391412": {"recommendationid": "38391412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198386984135", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513438665}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u867d\u8bf4\u5267\u60c5\u548c\u53bb\u6708\u7403\u76f8\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd8\u662f\u96be\u514d\u548c\u53bb\u6708\u7403\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\n1.\u9996\u5148\u6574\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u73a9\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u53bb\u6708\u7403\u6240\u5e26\u7ed9\u6211\u611f\u89e6\u6df1\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u53bb\u6708\u7403\u662f\u4e2a\u611f\u4eba\u7684\u7231\u60c5\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u800c\u5bfb\u627e\u5929\u5802\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u4e9b\u8bb8\u54f2\u7406\uff0c\u6211\u8fd9\u4e8c\u5341\u5e74\u7684\u7ecf\u5386\u8fd8\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u3002\n2.\u5176\u6b21\u5bfb\u627e\u5929\u5802\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6218\u6597\u7684\u65f6\u957f\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u6e38\u620f\u6027\u7684\u8003\u8651\uff0c\u4f46\u8f83\u957f\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u65f6\u95f4\u4f1a\u8ba9\u4eba\u4ece\u5267\u60c5\u4e2d\u8131\u8282\u3002\u4ee5\u53ca\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7684\u7279\u6548\u3002\u3002\u3002\u611f\u89c9\u6ca1\u5fc5\u8981\n3.\u4e24\u4f4d\u535a\u58eb\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8fd8\u662f\u548c\u53bb\u6708\u7403\u4e00\u6837\u6709\u8da3\uff0c\u7ed9\u7e41\u591a\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u589e\u8272\u4e0d\u5c11\u3002\n4.\u8bf4\u5230\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u5929\u5802\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6bd4\u53bb\u6708\u7403\u591a\u4e86\u597d\u591a\uff0c\u867d\u8bf4\u6709\u4e9b\u53e5\u5b50\u633a\u6709\u97f5\u5473\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u514d\u5ba1\u7f8e\u75b2\u52b3\uff0c\u6709\u79cd\u6446\u53e5\u5b50\u8bb2\u9053\u7406\u7684\u67b6\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u60c5\u7eea\u548c\u611f\u60c5\u5347\u534e\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5982\u53bb\u6708\u7403\u6765\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u3002\n5.\u914d\u4e50\u4f9d\u7136\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709for river\u8fd9\u79cd\u523b\u9aa8\u94ed\u5fc3\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u3002\n\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u53bb\u6708\u7403\u662f10\u5206\uff0c\u6211\u7ed9\u5bfb\u627e\u5929\u58028\u5206\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1513565016, "timestamp_updated": 1513565016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38391359": {"recommendationid": "38391359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052461321", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513488599}, "language": "english", "review": "Another excellent title by Freebird Games.

Comparing it to the first game in series, the story here is probably harder to project on yourself, so less people will feel it through, but still they'll understand. As before, there are moments to laugh, moments to shed a tear. Of course the strength of those depends on your background, but the authors here did great as always. Apart from the wish-granting thing there is also a story about other Sigmund staff and the way they work. Though in the second half of the game probably there could be less over-the-top stuff, just because differs too much from the overall storytelling. I mean when there are single gags (like the Pluto one) it is totally fine, but the whole episode with the sky magic stuff is too much. Again, To The Moon had the scene with Eva messing up with the school, which was fitting because it was pretty simple, but here the degree of craziness should've been lower, even though it can be explained.

The storytelling mastery of Kan Gao, paired with his touching piano and cello tunes, is still working wonders to gamers with empathy. I fell in love with the characters rather quickly, and by the moment of saying goodbye to them it got... well, emotional on a rather personal level. \nThe important thing about this one is that while still being able to make you tear up a bit, it can also give you hope, if you're responsive to the thought that's central to the plot of Colin's story. It can make the shadows around you seem a little bit less dark and everlasting. It can make you think that we are indeed the writers of our stories, and there still are a lot of wonderful things interlaced into our lives.\nThank you, Reives, for making me believe that everything will be alright, even if it's just for a moment.", "timestamp_created": 1513539661, "timestamp_updated": 1513539696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 468, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.946757", "comment_count": "51", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38384647": {"recommendationid": "38384647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198248916542", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513542613}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Sin palabras.

take To The Moon's spot as my favorite game, but... this.\n\nThis was stunning. For fans of the series (which you all should be), it had all the twists and layered stories you'd come to grow suspicious of and anticipated. If you haven't played the Christmas Minisodes, do it. A Bird Story too. This game stood on its own yet made enough references to the previous games to have me wildly grinning throughout... all of it, pretty much. \n\nI came into this trying desperately to lower my expecatations so as to not 'overhype' and be let down. I failed miserably on the 'lowering' front, but as I'm writing this review literally moments after finishing, I can definitely say that I surpassed even my loftiest expectations (To the Moon has an incredibly special place in my heart). Worth the 6 years. Kan Gao, you are an artist, and inspired me in more ways than you could imagine. I'm now a highly focused and years-in-practice Indie Dev with a focus on story, and I can definitely say this series was my main inspiration. Thank you.\n\n[spoiler] Also, flat out, I thought I cried at To the Moon and 'teared up' at Undertale's True Pacifist ending, but the game's been over for a few minutes now and I'm still just openly weeping at midnight. I don't even know what more to say at this point.

Giving you both laugh and moments of crying, it is masterpiece in it's full form: humour, story, music, even graphic. I don't know if there is much to say about this gem more, without going into spoilers, because well, let's be real, it is more of a interactive film than game, you do not actually \"play it\" but you \"experience it\". One thing that worries me so much is that there was 6 year break between To the Moon and Finding Paradise (with two minisodes and A Bird Story between them, but those were short ones), and with tension built towards ending of trilogy perhaps, I'm sad to wait another 6 years. But neverthless, I was happy to experience To the Moon when I was 16, I am now happy that I have experienced Finding Paradise at the age of 19, I will be more then happy to experience Episode 3 even aged 30. A big \"thank you\" to Kan, Laura and whole Freebirds crew, those were money well spend and I enjoyed every bit of it. If you liked To the Moon, or if you like story driven games, and graphic is not neccesarily a big factor for you, buy this game, play it. It is short, but emotions it gives are worth 10x more than that.

GOTY 2017!!!\n\nWhen I played To The Moon all those years ago, I teared up. The story, the simple yet beautiful retro graphics, THE MUSIC. I knew that it was a very special game that could not be duplicated. I didn't think that FreeBird themselves could make anything of that calibre again. Even to this day, It's a personal favourite. \n\nA Bird Story proved me utterly, utterly wrong. Using the same graphics and amazing music, It made an amazing and thought-provoking story with no words. And I too, had NO WORDS when playing it. \n\nAnd now this, the gem in the crown. Where do I start? \n\nThe graphics? They're just the same as always, they look retro, yet add themselves very well to the game. They are simplistic, but they take the best of To The Moon and A Bird Story and consolidate them into something that is visually stunning without trying hard. The visual effects look amazing, and they really mold well with the retro aesthetic. I honestly don't know how they could be made better.\n\nThe Music?\nIt is, once again, outstanding. Kan uses the same classical theme that worked so amazingly with the two previous games, but it is somehow better this time around. It conveys the same emotion without appearing out of place. Anyone that has played To The Moon or A Bird Story will notice that some of the tracks are remixes from those games, giving the game a nice, familiar feel in some of the segments. I can't wait for the OST to be released. \n\nBut how could I forget, the story!\nWhat am I meant to say? It's made by Freebird, so it is good of it's own admission. I think that this is one of the only 'Indie' games of this year to succeed in creating a story that is both captivating and worthy of tears. \nThe game might only be around 5 hours long, but in those 5 hours there is so much amazing story that it ends up being better than RPGs that are twice, or even 4 times as long. The story is a masterpiece, laced with just the right amount of humour (Which I really was looking forward to), emotion and thought-provokingness. It manages to stay within the world that the previous games had created, making little references to them and building on what has already been established. But it avoids the 'Electric Boogaloo' trap, making sure that it doesn't hang in the dogma of the previous games, but is equal or surpasses them. And believe me, this is one story that you really, REALLY don't want to not see. I cried unbelievably hard, I laughed my head off, and left the game feeling better and stronger than before I pressed play.\nGo in blind without any expectations, and this game will not disappoint.\n\nJust as with the earlier games, my only complaint is that you can only really 'Play' a Freebird game once before the initial amazingness is lost. It's one of those RPGs that are so good, you can't really replay with the same effect, but personally I think that's quite beautiful in a way. \nIf Sigmund really do exist, I hope they can just erase my memory of playing the game so I'm able to play it over and over again as if it was new. But, don't be sad that the game is finished, be happy because you were there to experience it. When the credits are rolling, you'll have found Paradise.\n\nSo, I can say without a doubt that Finding Paradise is my game of the year for 2017, or possibly for longer than that.

Ultimately it comes down to the question, \"Do I recommend Finding Paradise?\"\n\n...................Yes. Very reluctantly, yes.\n\nFirst and foremost, Finding Paradise is every bit a sequel to To The Moon. While the game stands on its own, it is a continuing story and you will be doing yourself a disservice by jumping into the series anywhere but the beginning. \n\nThe game is very much like its predecessor in formula and presentation. Having played the first one recently, it feels like I've barely even left and have started up on the next chapter. If you want more of the same, that is exactly what you can expect.\n\n........with one exception, unfortunately. Unlike the first game, the core subject matter of this one is, in a word, silly. It is very difficult to relate to the plight of the central character, and while it is presented with every bit as much sentimentality and poignancy as the first game, the lack of relatability and gravity makes it fall emotionally flat. It almost feels as if the author wanted a huge plot twist more than he wanted a relatable story, and that's just what we're left with.\n\nThe writing still has quite a lot of wit, charm and touches of humor, and combined with the excellent soundtrack, made this an overall enjoyable experience. \n\nI do very much look forward to the continuation of this series.", "timestamp_created": 1513503130,

It was worth it.[/h1]\n\nThe first time I played To The Moon, I was very impressed, but experienced some difficulties [spoiler]playing on an old netbook is a dubious idea :)[/spoiler]. But a couple of years ago I decided to play again this masterpiece and was even more impressed. This game is beautiful. Need I say that I had the same hopes for the FP?\n\nSo, I was waiting for this game. Often updated the page, hoping that, perhaps, now it will be released? But for the last three months because of the fuss I completely forgot about the game. [b]Imagine my surprise[/b] when Steam sent me a letter, the content of which was simple - [u]the FP is released[/u].\n\nThe first time I ran the game and heard the melody, goose bumps over my skin. I realized that this would be a masterpiece. So it turned out :)\n\n[b]Everything[/b] in this game - the plot, music, dialogue - all makes you genuinely empathize with the characters, filling the game with meaning. Playing To The Moon, I was able to hold back tears, but in FP much more tragedy or even sentimental things, [u]so the first tear ran down my cheek long before I got to the final[/u] [spoiler]Mens do not cry, you know, but... ;(([/spoiler]\n\nBut, in addition to the sad, the game has a lot more funny moments. With some references, I laughed at the voice, it was perfect :D\n\nAmong other things - the game leaves us even more questions. \n[spoiler]Why does Neal drink pills? What the hell is he doing in his office? And if you take into account those questions that left mini-zodes... Perhaps I'll just leave this [url=https://ibb.co/fUZYjm]picture[/url] here.\nSo, i'm ready to wait more :)[/spoiler]\n\nI can say with confidence - I LOVE THIS GAME WITH ALL HEART.

replayed TTM roughly 3 times, and watched several Youtuber's playthrough on it. So the hype when I learned Finding Paradise is going to be released is huge.\nTo be honest, like a lot of people I was more or less expecting similar experience as TTM. And if you are expecting another TTM, you might not end up liking this game.\n\nBecause this game isn't TTM. This game if Finding Paradise. And I don't think it's fair to compare this game to its predecessor.\n\nThings I like about this game:\n[list]\n[*] Soundtrack is beautiful as usual <3 Can't wait for it to be for sale\n[*] More cutscenes and CG!\n[*] The humors dropped in throughout the game, whether it be doctors' banters or the [spoiler]overactive imagination to the situation.[/spoiler] [spoiler]I laughed so hard at the Godfather reference even though I knew it was coming [/spoiler] \n[*] This game is like the love child of [spoiler]Inception[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Fight Club[/spoiler], which are some of my all-time favourite movies\n[*] It's really fun to try to solve what's really going on with Colin before the big reveal\n[*] This game and Bird Story completes each other, which I think is really cool, especially when [spoiler]I see the green notebook and other items of importance[/spoiler]\n[*] I like that this story takes a different approach than TTM in its theme. To me, [spoiler]the punch is spread throughout the story instead of concentrating on the last 10% of the story. I like it. I like it a lot.[/spoiler]\n[*] The puzzles are changed up as well, which is another pretty cool thing. It keeps that same element of user interaction and braintease while keeping things fresh and interesting. It's super easy too, which doesn't take away too much time and attention from the story itself\n[*] [spoiler]Loved the ending which showed what's happening in Colin's head and the real world at the same time[/spoiler]\n[/list]\nThings I'm unsure about this game:\n[list]\n[*] A lot about Act 3 makes me feel like I'm tripping. A lot of the time I'm just like \"lol wut\" in a confused way\n[*] [spoiler]I'm not sure why Colin employed the Sigmund's service. The most reasonable motivation I can come up with right now is because he wants to see Faye again. I think this could be expanded a bit more towards the end... or maybe I should play Bird Story again, because I'm convinced Faye is the bird[/spoiler]\n[*] [spoiler]Why do people keep getting married over a cliff xD[/spoiler]\n[*] [spoiler]Nooooo don't kick soccer balls near a car[/spoiler]\n[/list]\n\n[spoiler]Wait so who's that woman riding away on the bike?[/spoiler]\n\nAnyway, just want to add my own compliments on this already huge pile of praises. Great work! Now to wait for another five years before the next release T_T\n\n[b]Now when can I buy the soundtrack?![/b]", "timestamp_created": 1513497619, "timestamp_updated": 1513497619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38370272": {"recommendationid": "38370272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308122632", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513497022}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u54ed\u6210\u80ba\u708e", "timestamp_created": 1513497375, "timestamp_updated": 1513497375, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38370223": {"recommendationid": "38370223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358958879", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513496180}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u9ad8\u77b0\u80fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0b\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u539f\u58f0\u5e26\u89812025\u5e74\u624d\u89e3\u9501\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1513497191, "timestamp_updated": 1513497191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38370094": {"recommendationid": "38370094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035476471", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513396304}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][i]Finding Paradise[/i][/h1]\n\n[h1]This Review is [i][b][u]Spoiler Free[/u][/b][/i][/h1]\n\n[b]This game is worth more than they're charging for[/b]\n\nFinally. Freakin' [i]Finally[/i].\nI have been waiting for [i]years[/i] for [i]Finding Paradise[/i] to release, and it's finally here.\n[i]Finding Paradise[/i] is the direct sequel to Freebird Games' smash hit [i]To The Moon[/i], and is just as good. Still just as short, still just as bitter-sweet, [i]Finding Paradise[/i] has the same qualities that made [i]To The Moon[/i] great. \n\nlike I said, I've been waiting for this game for years, and I'm not afraid to admit that I've been known to fanboy a bit, but this game is great. I played it all the way through the night it came out, and have spent the subsequent days obsessively refreshing Freebird Games' Bandcamp page because I want that soundtrack to play at my birthday, my funeral, hell even my wedding. I daresay that I even enjoyed [i]Finding Paradise's[/i] soundtrack more than to [i]To The Moon's[/i].\n\nOnce more, Shall we get into the nitty gritty?\n\n[b][u]The Story[/u][/b]\nAs with [i]To The Moon[/i], [i]Finding Paradise[/i] doesn't just [i]have[/i] a story. It [i]is[/i] a story. It's the same length as [i]To The Moon[/i] (which honestly I find it baffling that they can fit so much emotion into so little time), so it'll net you about four hours. [i]Finding Paradise[/i]'s story conveys a message about being true to yourself, much like [i]To The Moon[/i]'s, and it does so wonderfully.\n\n[i]Finding Paradise[/i] sees the return of our favorite protagonists, Neil Watts and Eva Rosalene along with a couple more familiar faces, helping a new patient fulfill his last wish. This time 'round we're tasked with helping a man named Colin find happiness. Now, that's all I'm going to tell you, becasue telling you much more would just mess with the masterfully crafted flow of the story.\n\n[i]Finding Paradise[/i] is sad, which is good, I like sad, and don't get me wrong, the story is still leagues ahead of what most other games do nowadays, but it wasn't as compelling as [i]To The Moon[/i]'s. I'm gonna repeat myself here: This game's story is [i]great[/i]. On my list  of games an stories that I wish I could both forget to play again, and also never forget ever, this one ranks right behind [i]To The Moon[/i]. I'm saying this to make one thing clear: I'm about to criticize this, but be warned that I'm comparing this to what is, quite possibly, my favorite game, story, whaterver-the-hell-you-want-to-call-it of all time. You have been warned.\n\n[i]Finding paradise[/i]'s story has one big thing that made it fall short of [i]To The Moon[/i]'s, and that's just that it requires a little bit more suspension of disbelief. In a game where you've got a giant megacorp visiting senior citizens to change their memories, it's not gonna be hard to set aside a little bit of logic to enjoy such a wonderful story. This is really the only thing stopping [i]Finding Paradise[/i] from being better than [i]To The Moon[/i], which is saying something.\n\n[b][u]The Gameplay[/u][/b]\nExactly the same as [i]To The Moon[/i]'s, if you're looking for compelling gameplay, you're in the wrong place.\n\n\n[b][u]The Music[/u][/b]\nDon't tell my buddy Tom I said this, but I may just think that [i]Finding Paradise[/i] has better music than [i]To The Moon[/i]. I mean it. [i]Finding Paradise[/i]'s soundtrack adds another layer to [i]To The Moon[/i]'s, and that's for good reason. Where [i]To The Moon[/i] focused on Johnny, who plays piano, [i]Finding Paradise[/i] features [i]two whole new instruments[/i]: Guitar and Cello, becasue there are two characters who play the guitar and cello. Huh, fancy that. \n\nOn top of everything else, Laura Shigihara is back, and better than ever in [i]Finding Paradise[/i], with a lyrical number that rivals [i]Everything's Alright[/i] both musically and emotionally.\n\nIf you want to listen to it, you can find it on Bandcamp [url=https://freebirdgames.bandcamp.com/album/finding-paradise-ost-coming-tomorrow]here[/url] or on steam [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/770780/Finding_Paradise_Soundtrack/]here.[/url]\n\n\nNow, for everybody's favorite section!...\n\n[b][u]Rant[/u][/b]\nJesus H. Christ I swear I screamed like a little girl when I got the email that this game released. I have been waiting for [i]so long[/i] for this, that I bought this the instant I got home, and actually got it [i]before it went on sale[/i]. \n\nLike I said in the Story section, this game falls a nanometer short of [i]To The Moon[/i], and that is only, [i]only[/i] because it seemingly adds just a [i]tad[/i] more fantasy. And hey, for all I know it could actually happen in real life, so there's that.\n\n/rant\n\nIf you're somehow here without having played [i]To The Moon[/i], you can pick it up here:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/206440/\nand read my review on it [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/FP42/recommended/206440/]here[/url].\n\nThere's a little note in this game to Freebird Games' intermediary game [i]A Bird Story[/i], which you can find here: \nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/327410/?snr=1_5_9__412\nKeep in mind that you don't have to play this first, though I highly recommend it.\n\n\n\n\nIf you enjoy [i]To The Moon[/i] and Laura Shigihara's music, you should also check out her game [i]Rakuen[/i].

magnifique, de tout simplement beau, dans l'histoire qu'il nous narre.\n\nLes graphismes issus de RPG-Maker sont toujours aussi simples, bien que tr\u00e8s bien r\u00e9alis\u00e9s.\nPetit b\u00e9mol, l'int\u00e9raction du joueur avec l'univers sont encore moins pr\u00e9sents que dans To The Moon, rendant le jeu encore plus narratif qu'avant (non pas que \u00e7a me d\u00e9range

But my god did this game move me to tears even more than To The Moon did. \n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Only play if you aren't looking for a full on video game. This is more of an experience than a video game.\n\n\nAlso prepare to cry. If you don't feel anything from this you don't have a soul. \n\n\n\n\nFor those who have never heard of freebird, start with To The Moon. You'll know what you're getting into for cheaper and this is pretty much a sequel though not connected super hard to the first. For those who have played To The Moon and liked it, this is a must buy and it's not close. \n\nThe gameplay is pretty much the same, but the puzzles are improved so you don't get stuck sometimes like I did in To The Moon and just couldn't solve the puzzles without reloading or cheating (cause I'm stupid I know but still). The humor is spot on, and one of the best things about the series overall. For how absolutely heartbreaking the stories are, the humor is always unexpected but is a welcoming sight to keep you going and not just take sob breaks. There are even easter eggs in this one, which I did not expect but did not disappoint. Even the small annoyances that you find in the game that you have to put up with they make jokes out of. \n\nThe delivery is perfect. Not a single thing to hate. Game finishes in roughly 3-4 hours, perfect length so you don't feel like you're wasting time. Plot twists literally everywhere. \n\n\n10/10 please have minisodes and sequels.", "timestamp_created": 1513491580, "timestamp_updated": 1513491580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

The emotions evoked range from curiosity to dread to joy to amusement to sadness to wonder. This is also one of two or possibly three games that has made me tear up while playing it, with the set also including To The Moon.\n\nWhile the ending of this story isn't as potentially heart-tugging as the finale of To The Moon, nor does it have as sudden of a twist as its predecessor, this is still a profoundly impactful and well-done title, taking full advantage of the wonderfully done music, beautiful artwork, and finely nuanced scripting.\n\nIt's not a perfect form, and it's hard to fully consider this a \"game\" as much as it is a user-advanced movie set in the RPG Maker engine. You still have the oddities such as identifying random memory objects in a scene or unlocking the next scene via a small mini-game (as well as a few larger minigames near the end that were impressive in implementation, but somewhat annoying).\n\nStill, this form of storytelling works quite well and rewards you immensely if you invest yourself in it and think about it as you experience it, and removing some of the annoyances might make for a less whole experience, so I appreciate the author experimenting with the medium.\n\nWhile most people will probably point to To The Moon as the superior product of the two major games, I found this title to be perhaps more relatable and, ultimately, potentially more powerful because of that.\n\nJust buy the game and give it your attention. It's about the length of a pair of movies at a fraction of the cost, and it's quite worth the investment of time and attention.\n\nWe need more designers like this.

Six years it took me to play To the Moon. Six years it took me to discover Freebird Games.\n\nI will get to the game, but I want to make a personal point first. \n\n2017 has been a rough year for a consumer of games. Let's be honest with ourselves. The trend for gaming has been to assault our wallet. Whether it be DLC, Season Passes, or loot boxes/crates. The sectioning off of content for those willing to pay extra is quite frankly sad. I feel ashamed that I have accepted that is \u201cjust the way things are.\u201d \n\nI never heard of Freebird Games or To the Moon until early-2017. To the Moon was one of the best games I ever played in my life (#19 on my overall list from over the last 26 years). I was unaware that a sequel was going to be released until about a week ago. When I found this out I was absolutely pumped. I was pumped not because I expected this to be an equal or better story/game than To the Moon. I paid $2 for To the Moon and I felt that I literally stole from this developer. I was pumped that I was going to be a day 1 commit for their new game and pay almost full price to support what gaming should be about. This is it here folks. This is the real deal. Go look at To the Moon, yeah they released DLC episodes after the game released. Is Freebird Games like EA or Bungie and over-pricing that DLC? No they are giving it for free. Not only does this series deserve an Overwhelmingly Positive rating, this developer does as well. \n\nI digress and will provide my review for Finding Paradise:\n\nPositives:\n-Much improved puzzle system- I stated in my To the Moon review that the puzzle system felt slightly like filler. This did not and made sense depending on the memory. The puzzles were not terribly difficult, but kept things interesting.\n\n-Music- Omg! This soundtrack was incredible. If you release it for purchase, I will buy it off steam. I am not going to spoil anything, but there was a scene towards the middle where both a piano and cello were being played. Instead of moving on to the next scene, I stopped for 3 minutes and just listened. I have never done that before. That song was one of the most emotional things I have ever heard in my life. I almost cried.\n\n-Story- A very well written story that was unpredictable and wrapped up well at the end. Do not really want to go too deep here for spoilers.\n\nNegatives:\n-I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the different battle system change ups towards the end, but I guess it was a nice change of pace. These scenes were very short lived and hardly hurt my opinion of the game.\n\nFinal Recap:\nPeople are probably going to want to know if this game was as good as To the Moon. That would be a more complicated question to answer than one would think. I felt that this game had better music, more polish, and better puzzles than To the Moon. I did feel that To the Moon was slightly more emotional and had a slightly better story. In my review for To the Moon, I gave it a 9.75. I would give this game a 9.5. Well worth $9. Heck, I would pay double that easily. \n\nLast comment: Thank you Freebird Games!

That being said both \"games\" (or visual novels if you will) are masterpieces and beautiful pieces of art. \nI went in, with high expectations knowing that To the Moon would be hard to outshine and even though the game in my opinion was worse it did NOT disappoint.\n\nThe story is as great as you'd expect from Kan Gao, it takes a complete different turn than TtM and still manages to captivate and surprise you, I lost track of time while playing this, which is evident of great writing. The humour is spot-on and probably even better than TtM's, not much else can be said about the story without spoiling anything but know that you're in for a treat. The mini-games are also very much improved upon.\n\nThe soundtrack is great and I'm definitely going to listen to it in the time to come, it still surprises me how well the soundtrack is composed with a limited set of instruments, most of the songs are just with the piano just as it was with TtM.\nI think it helps to set the right setting and atmosphere in these types of games and the songs are just as good as TtM's.\n  \nI know this may not be everyone's cup of tea, players who are only interested in gameplay might want to pass on this one but personally I can't recommend this enough.\n\nAfter all this praise you may ask why isn't this game better than TtM? I think there are just certain elements that resonated with me better in TtM than in this but remember that this is just my opinion.\n\nI can't wait for the next game cause this has been a near-perfect story-driven game.\n10 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1513476939, "timestamp_updated": 1513521195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38365454": {"recommendationid": "38365454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030148265", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513475580}, "language": "english", "review": "Thank you, Kan Gao.

Midway through however (especialy with what I knew of To the Moon\" the feeling of dread started to set in. Things started to break down so it seemed like something horible was about to happen soon but couldnt tell how soon it would be.\n\nWhile I did encounter a couple bugs, they are minor and not a big deal. As of yesterday the dev patched them so if you're getting it now it shouldn't be a problem.\n\nAll in all i enjoyed it.

Finding Paradise for me made me think a lot more on the different people out their in the world and how they cope with thngs like lonliness and how they overcame it, along with that it also showed me how humans aren't black and white their is always a grey area with them, the entire idea of Sigmund Corp was in a way tested, Back in To The Moon most of us thought that what Sigmund Corp did was amazing something truly astonishing but we get the negative side to it when the DLC came out but during this particular one it really made you think \"If I could change my past would I?\" In this case Colin wanted to leave without a single regret but at the same time we learn that those decision, those regrets we have, can actually forge out future in so many ways and for someone that doesn't seem to want to change the past then why change those regrets? (I'm probably rambaling for anyone reading.) This really makes you think about this game and life it self what they say in the game is true No matter how much you do in your lifetime you can't experince everything but in this case the question they're asking is \"would you choose your memories or will you choose a false life?\" [/spoiler]\n\nAnd I'm done It probably sounds dumb but i felt like saying something anyway.

It feels like a familiar old friend, but then does something completely different with its narrative structure. Freebird has succeeded in creating something very meaningful and relatable by telling another wonderful story about growing up and looking back.\n\nNow this is an RPG Maker game, and that will turn a few people off of playing it. However, despite the limitations of the engine, the game is able to tell a wonderful story not just through text but through the action of its character, as well as its camera movements. You have to give major props to the developer that they were able to craft a very well put-together audiovisual experience through just sprites.\n\nSpeaking of audiovisual, the score and soundtrack is top notch again. The audio is mixed very well with the movement of the game, and the song hits at the perfect spot at the climax to really drive home the narrative.\n\nI would say though that there might be a few too many mini-games that take you out of the narrative, or that there are a few jokes there that is probably out of place within the context of the current scene, but really it just adds to Neil Watts' personality.\n\nEven though the story stands on its own, I really wouldn't recommend playing this before To the Moon. This game pretty much assumes that you are aware of the universe and how it works, and really, this story works better if you already have an expectation on how the operation should go.\n\nFinally and the most importantly, this game is for you if you enjoyed To the Moon or any other bittersweet or tear-jerking stories. Nothing feels like padding. It's all meat here that will make your eyes water as soon by the first bite because it's the best steak you've ever tasted.\n\nKan, I love you bro. You too, Laura.\n\nWhat I played: The full game in just over 5 hours\nLike: The universe, the story, the soundtrack, the cinematography\nDislike: A few pacing and tone design decisions.\nRating: 5 out of 5", "timestamp_created": 1513465196, "timestamp_updated": 1513465251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.673386", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38362200": {"recommendationid": "38362200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108278488", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 74, "last_played": 1514045755}, "language": "english", "review": "Even with the high expectations from To The Moon, I thought this was an amazing game.

Colin, Sofia and Faye may not feel as relatable to me as Johnny and River, but that's more of a personal thing. Still they are drawn as living characters, who feel natural in every way (well, almost).\nAnother upside, this time even more than in the last game, is the music. Great soundtrack, fits the mood.\n\nI should mention, that it is advised to play the rest of the series, before starting this one, so To the Moon, the two miniepisodes included, and A Birds Story.

I'm not going to spoil anything, but when a certain something is revealed...it's really poorly-executed. There are some moments that feel like they should belong to a completely different game, but I'm glad that the developer tried to make something new. One of my major fears was that this would just be a second [i] To the Moon [/i], but it isn't. It's exactly what a sequel should be: Taking the original concept and leaping off from there.\n\nEven though you won't get as attached to these new characters as you did with River and Johnny, the story and (some) added gameplay elements more than make up for it. My only criticism regarding the story is that it should have been longer, but that is a good criticism to have. I wanted to spend more time playing this and learning about the characters, and while I didn't get that, it says a lot about the game that it made me feel that way.\n\nIn short: If you liked [i] To the Moon [/i]...or heck, even if you [i] didn't [/i] like it, then this game is absolutely worth your money.

What a ride.\n\nI just finished this game maybe... 20 minutes ago, as of writing this review. So there's a lot that I still haven't processed yet. Heck, with To The Moon, I spent at least a couple weeks letting everything sink in. Both of these games have a lot of depth to them, but not so much that you can't follow the narrative or the characters' journeys. It's just that with a game many years in the making from a team that actually cares, a lot of love and a lot of thought goes into it. And so, naturally, I don't think you can appreciate EVERYTHING all at once. It takes a little time. That's been my experience, at least. And I'm certainly not complaining; it's hard to find games that dive this deep into our common shared emotions, worries, desires, and basic humanity - without being pretentious or convoluted.\n\nHow effortlessly the story is told, how seamlessly you can jump from heartbreak to hilarity in the blink of an eye, and how subtley this game tugs at your heartstrings... it's amazing. I only cried at the end, and I was almost confused while I was crying. \"Why am I crying? But this game hasn't hit me hard enough to make me cry. Oh... wait. Actually, it has. Dang.\" That was basically my thought process while I was crying. Seriously. I've never had an experience like that in any medium of entertainment or art.\n\nSo... if you've actually read this far down, then is this game worth buying? Ummm...\n\nYES.\n\nA thousand times yes. This game had it all: heartbreak, mystery, suspense, laughs, tears, characters worth rooting for, a story worth telling, AMAZING music, and even some out-of-nowhere gameplay mixed in with the narrative. (Nicely done, Kan.) I can't think of a single reason NOT to buy this game.\n\nPlease: support everyone who worked on this game and just do it!!!", "timestamp_created": 1513459891, "timestamp_updated": 1513460148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38360844": {"recommendationid": "38360844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182263387", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513344252}, "language": "german", "review": "Wer \"To the Moon\" und \"A Bird Story\" mochte, macht beim Kauf hier absolut nichts falsch!

Maybe it was just Steam error, IDK, really\n- Second, the gameplay per se is not really there, the game is more like a movie, but I knew it would be like it, so nothing to complain about here. \n- Finally, there's no \"Nextgen graphics\" to be found.

I couldn't have predicted the ending of this game in my lifetime. \n+ The game is messing with your emotions. There are moments when you laugh and 5 minutes later you're about to cry.

I really recommend you to buy it or at least to watch it.\nAlso, special thanks to Freebird games and Kan Gao for this game, keep up the great work and I hope I will be able to write another evaluation for the third episode ! :)", "timestamp_created": 1513453704, "timestamp_updated": 1513453704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38358614": {"recommendationid": "38358614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026669800", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513453126}, "language": "schinese", "review": "100/10\n\u827a\u672f\u54c1\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8a00\u8bed\u90fd\u662f\u532e\u4e4f\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u827a\u672f\u54c1\n", "timestamp_created": 1513453364, "timestamp_updated": 1513453364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38358562": {"recommendationid": "38358562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113457184", "num_games_owned": 1543, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513533997}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll keep this pretty short.

Further separating this from a re-tread (which wouldn't have been too bad of a thing) is differences in how memories are traversed in the first game and this.\n\nThe relationship between the doctors of Sigmund Corp are further developed here as are the differences between the previous 2 on how they view the mission and contract.  This is where the meta plot that started to be fleshed out in the previous installment grows, but it does end on a serious cliffhanger if that irks you.\n\nColin wants his life mostly unchanged, but he wants something just a bit \"better\".   You encounter past regrets, but some of them are so insignificant (spilled beverage on honeymoon) that one would assume those can't possibly be what was asked of the player characters.   Colin has an unusual motivation and that drives the flow of time in the story.\n\nThis was not a tear jerker and I don't think it was meant to be.  Kan Gao always said he never intends his stories to be so.  However, being a good storyteller he will leave you with a sad smile at the end at the beauty of Colin's one true wish. Overall, the story is creepier than the first and the prime plot point is easily discernable, but I do not feel that lessened the impact when the game (mostly) revealed it.  \n\nPlaytime is I would

It is, however, well worth your time and money if you enjoyed the first game.[/b]\n\nThe story is enjoyable, though some parts of it are predictable if you are paying attention. The idea of travelling through someone's memories and seeing parts of their life through their eyes is something I love, and it is executed well. The music is quality, but I didn't find it particularly memorable. Graphics and animations do their job, and there are some fairly nice little details in there that I enjoyed. The minigame for \"preparing\" mementos was unobtrusive and fairly simple. In a way I would have preferred having to work more for completing the puzzles, but I also appreciate the fact that this isn't a puzzle game and more difficult puzzles could feel out of place and push people away.\n\nWhile this game is a stand-alone experience, it does reference the previous installments, especially in its frame story, and this additional context might enhance your experience. As such, I would recommend playing To the Moon and the minisodes before Finding Paradise. I haven't played A Bird Story myself, but I'd assume going through it wouldn't hurt, either. Having said that, I can't help but wonder if playing Finding Paradise before playing To the Moon would make this game stand out more.\n\nNow then, the reasons for saying this game isn't a second To the Moon are fairly simple. However, they all come down to Finding Paradise not having as much of an impact on me.\n[list]\n[*]At least for me, the first game came more or less out of nowhere. I had no idea what to expect, and what it delivered hit much harder because of that. Finding Paradise was in a much less favourable position having to follow up after To the Moon's success. I already knew what I could possibly expect, and thus the impact was lessened.\n[*]At least in part thanks to the previous point, Finding Paradise's emotional highs were not as great as To the Moon's. The predictability of a key story point also contributed to this; the characters were shocked by a revelation a good bit after I'd figured it out. It is also really difficult to compete with what To the Moon did.\n[*]There isn't a piece of music that has the same effect as what a key piece in To the Moon had. That song still evokes memories and emotions.\n[/list]\n\nFinding Paradise may not be To the Moon, but it shouldn't have to be.\n\nWhat follows contains spoilers for both games, and is there simply to provide a bit more context and comparison between the two.\n[spoiler] The realization of what the bunnies were about, and how River kept trying to remind her husband of what he'd forgotten is something that stuck with me. That tragedy hurt on a whole different level, as of course did the brother situation. Faye being an imaginary friend wouldn't have had nearly as big of an impact even if it weren't as predictable as it was. \n\nThe bait and switch in Finding Paradise was a clever thing, but at the same time it prevented a situation where everything just [i]clicks[/i] as it all comes together. All the \"regrets\" the player kept discovering were essentially red herrings, and the fact that in the end nothing was changed (aside from Faye and Colin finally catching up again) was a bit of a letdown. It fit, and I liked it, but it definitely didn't have as much of an impact as that moment when River walks in after having been removed by Eva. Figuring out the bunnies was a moment when things just came together and clicked.

Ale mimo wszystko nie ma takiej mocy emocjonalnej jak To The Moon z kilku powod\u00f3w.\n\n1. Niewa\u017cne co wymy\u015bli Kan Gao, stworzy\u0142 naprawd\u0119 niepowtarzaln\u0105 histori\u0119, kt\u00f3rej ju\u017c po prostu nie przebije i wida\u0107 to w tej grze, aczkolwiek zawsze mo\u017ce pr\u00f3bowa\u0107 jak w tej grze, gdy\u017c wida\u0107, \u017ce jeszcze nie sko\u0144czy\u0142.\n2. Pojawiaj\u0105 si\u0119 elementy humoru znacznie cz\u0119\u015bciej ni\u017c w samym To The Moon, cz\u0119sto te\u017c mruga do nas smaczkami cho\u0107by z poprzedniej cz\u0119\u015bci. To nic jednak z\u0142ego, wr\u0119cz przeciwnie, sama historia nie ma wtedy wra\u017cenia przygn\u0119biaj\u0105cej, zw\u0142aszcza \u017ce historia Colina absolutnie taka nie by\u0142a. Jednak\u017ce czasami pojawia\u0142 si\u0119 humor w takich momentach, \u017ce wchodzi\u0142e\u015b w nie ten stan ducha, w jakim moim odczuciu powinno si\u0119 by\u0107, co mog\u0142o powa\u017cnie naruszy\u0107 odbi\u00f3r ca\u0142ej gry. Trzeba mie\u0107 to pod uwag\u0119 kiedy b\u0119dzie si\u0119 gra\u0142o samemu i pami\u0119ta\u0107, \u017ce historia w tej grze nie jest taka sama jak w To The Moon, gdy\u017c w\u0105tpi\u0119, \u017ceby nawet co innego tu pasowa\u0142o. Tw\u00f3rca zrobi\u0142 gr\u0119 pod swoj\u0105 wizj\u0119 i dopracowa\u0142 niemal idealnie tak, \u017ce jakakolwiek zmiana mog\u0142aby spowodowa\u0107 ju\u017c odczuciem, \u017ce gramy w co innego.\n3.

Zwyczajnie idzie innym torem, nawet styl gry jest nieco inny. Niby ci sami bohaterowie, ale nie gramy ju\u017c w To The Moon, lecz w ca\u0142kiem inn\u0105 gr\u0119 i wida\u0107 to pod ka\u017cdym niemal wzgl\u0119dem, poza oczywi\u015bcie grafik\u0105 i bohaterami i innymi punktami w grze.

Es un trabajo muy emotivo, que intenta calar hondo, navegando por la vida de Colin en sus ultimos dias. Es una historia lo que ofrece este juego, no encontrar\u00e1s unos graficos next gen ni una jugabilidad divina, pero merece la pena echarse de cabeza a este juego y disfutarlo. En lo personal tengo que decir que To the Moon me emociono bastante m\u00e1s que este, que me dej\u00f3 al borde de la l\u00e1grima, y pensaba que este me sabr\u00eda a poco, que me tendr\u00eda que conformar con una historieta con ansias de algo grande pero que no llegaba a lo que hizo grande a la primera parte. En cambio, he encontrado una historia elaborada, con personajes muy bien construidos en el poco espacio en el que se presentan, el simbolismo que le da a los objetos que tanto me gust\u00f3 del primer titulo, y un largo etc. y pese a no ser tan bueno como To the Moon me sigue pareciendo un \"Altamente recomendado\" y tambi\u00e9n recomiendo seguir el trabajo de Kan Gao, que no decepciona.

review.\nWill contain spoiler and review about To the Moon, so please don't read the spoiler part if you don't want to be spoiled.\n\nPros:\n- Better puzzles to break memento than To the Moon.\n- Good story telling, no duplicate from To the Moon. Must say it was a good improvement.\n- I like how the game remind me of the missing link in a room, that did save a lots of times compare to To the moon. The path is not too long, too.\n\nCons:\n[spoiler]- I HATE jumpscare, and really hate that jumpscare. Also I'm not the type that can play fighting or shooting game.\n So I was going through hell to go through that part.\nReally, I didn't sign up for that genre. It's not funny you know.[/spoiler]\n\n- I'm here for the feel. And this game doesn't provide me with it.\n\nGood puzzles? Only better than To the moon say frankly. \nGood surprise? Nope, may be creative, but doesn't linked anything at all.\nIf I want good puzzles and good surprise, I will buy another game, not this one.\n\nBecause the thing I want from this game is the feel and a good story, but it didn't provide me those - for me, the main point of the story is just nonsense so this is clearly negative review. \n\n- Plot holes. In this game, Eva and Neil became dull and the technical element doesn't make sense to me anymore.\n\n- Bugs. I had to replace my save file with one from the community to continue to play the game. If you search the community, you'll find out lots of people experienced them too.\n\nNow is the details of those points:\n[spoiler]\n- IMAGINARY FRIEND??? Really? I played all those time, for a scene of him and his imaginary friend?? Really? \nHow does an imaginary friend \"always protect you\"?\n\nI tried to get through this point by reading lots of review, I know this is a story about Collin's growing up and his life.\n\nBut sorry, a grown up man, a father who still clinging to his imaginary friend, got affected easily by an advertisment and then even risking his beloved ones's happiness can't make sense to me.\n\nHe is an old man, not a high school or college boy. And he's a father. Sorry, can't sympathy with someone like this.\n\n- The music became lame after I completed the game. In To the moon, the moment \"Everything is alright\" was playing, and the moment \"For River\" was renamed to \"To the moon\" really make me cried. But for this one, the music doesn't have any meaning or linking to anything, so it became lame after I completed it.\n\n- Last time, Eva decided to erase River because \"the reason Johny want to go to the moon, is to find River\", and she hoped that by go to the moon he will meet her again anyway. But this time? They don't even know what the patient want, but still decied to \"try\" erase Faye. When did Eva and Neil become such a bad doctor?\n\n- Faye got those power, maybe you will say the reason is Neil's changes to the machine, but still it became a flaw to me. Technology doesn't make sense anymore if you added too much fantasy. And I'm not here for fantasy.\n\nAnd let's be clear about this. Imaginary friend IS NOT REAL and CAN'T BE REAL. Even if one person want their imaginary friend to be real how much, they are still not real, without thought or real characteristic.\n\n- The key scene of this game gave me no feeling. Okay, maybe say goodbye to your childhood to become stronger is a point to remember. But compare to how we see the moon in to the moon - how all the rabbit and other point linked to each other, this one is poor designed and couldn't describe its meaning well.\n\n- Just like the key scene, overal the items in this game doesn't connect to each other. Or the way they connected, is poorly written.\n[/spoiler]\n\nOverall I must say I did enjoyed it, because I thought it will be a story about family's connection, and was waiting for it to happen [spoiler]after I saw how sad Fia was because of Collin's decision to call Sigmund. I thought that maybe, just maybe, he feel incomplete, because he was always wanted to do more for his beloved one - he just doesn't realize that.[/spoiler] Then the real story broke all those enjoyment of mine.\n\nMaybe I expected too much. I told myself it's really hard to have another to the moon, but was still expecting a good story after all. Then I got this game, I feel like I was fooled with a poorly written and still have bugs game.\n\nThis game was delayed for too long, then still have game breaking bugs.

Apesar de n\u00e3o ser necess\u00e1rio ter jogado os dois jogos anteriores para entender perfeitamente o que acontece, \u00e9 altamente recomend\u00e1vel para melhor entendimento de certas passagens. \n\nNo papel de Eva Rosalene e Neil Watts, voc\u00ea tem um trabalho a fazer: Realizar o \u00faltimo desejo de seu paciente no leito de morte, entrando em suas mem\u00f3rias e alterando-as em nome desse objetivo.\n\n[h1]Jogabilidade[/h1]\n\nN\u00e3o houveram muitas altera\u00e7\u00f5es entre um jogo e outro. Ainda sendo um jogo de RPGMaker, acaba sendo bem limitado. Voc\u00ea apenas move pelas dire\u00e7\u00f5es e interage com objetos, tendo vez ou outra alguma leve mudan\u00e7a de jogabilidade para algum prop\u00f3sito superior na hist\u00f3ria. \n\nTalvez a maior mudan\u00e7a foi terem adicionado a op\u00e7\u00e3o de trocar entre os personagens quando est\u00e3o separados (as vezes), embora d\u00ea uma ideia n\u00e3o-linear, n\u00e3o consegue quebrar  esse formato, mas ainda \u00e9 um recurso interessante e infelizmente usado pouco em Finding Paradise.\n\nEm determinados momentos, pequenos puzzles ser\u00e3o colocados para que sejam resolvidos e ent\u00e3o voc\u00ea possa prosseguir pela hist\u00f3ria. S\u00e3o simples, onde as vezes tendo algum impedimento ou n\u00e3o, voc\u00ea tenta alinhar 3 ou mais objetos iguais (relacionado \u00e0 mem\u00f3ria em quest\u00e3o) e ent\u00e3o se quebram, gerando a energia necess\u00e1ria para prosseguir.\n\n[h1]Hist\u00f3ria e enredo[/h1]\n\nO ponto alto do jogo, obviamente. Aos familiarizados com To The Moon, a ideia \u00e9 a mesma: Nossos doutores v\u00e3o realizar o desejo de Colin, nosso querido protagonista de A Bird's Story. Como j\u00e1 dito, apesar de n\u00e3o ser necess\u00e1rio para entender a hist\u00f3ria de Finding Paradise, jog\u00e1-lo vai dar uma base mais firme de certas situa\u00e7\u00f5es durante este jogo.\n\nEva Rosalene e Neil Watts s\u00e3o dois funcion\u00e1rios que trabalham em equipe para a Sigmund Corp, lugar que oferece um servi\u00e7o \u00fanico para seus clientes: Realizar seu mais profundo desejo no momento pr\u00f3ximo do fim de sua vida. Uma tarefa complicada, at\u00e9 invasiva, mas \u00e9 tudo para que as pessoas partam sem nenhum arrependimento.\n\nO paciente: Colin \u00e9 um ex-piloto de avi\u00e3o, casado e com um filho. A hist\u00f3ria conta que em seus dias de idoso, ele decidiu assinar o contrato com a Sigmund Corp, empresa que realiza seus \u00faltimos desejos. Infelizmente, sua esposa n\u00e3o viu a ideia com bons olhos. Diferente do jogo anterior, n\u00e3o temos uma no\u00e7\u00e3o concreta do que \u00e9 o desejo de Colin.\n\nAmbos os protagonistas possuem personalidades fortes, e o humor \u00e9 t\u00e3o presente quanto no seu antecessor, deixando a experi\u00eancia mais relaxante, mesmo tratando de uma tem\u00e1tica mais pesada. Ainda assim, \u00e9 muito prov\u00e1vel que voc\u00ea d\u00ea muitas risadas durante o jogo. Extremamente gratificante.\n\nO enredo \u00e9 envolvente de uma maneira \u00fanica, que pretende o jogador quanto mais ele conhece a hist\u00f3ria, mesmo n\u00e3o tendo nenhum sentido total ainda. As revela\u00e7\u00f5es e dicas m\u00ednimas que o jogo vai largando para voc\u00ea, \u00e9 suficiente para que em pouco tempo, voc\u00ea esteja j\u00e1 esteja emocionalmente envolvido com toda situa\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\n[h1]Trilha Sonora[/h1]\n\nRica em sentimentos. A forma que a m\u00fasica de Finding Paradise se expressa \u00e9 algo dif\u00edcil de colocar em palavras. As faixas transmistem os mais diversos sentimentos, mesmo em cenas que a mesma m\u00fasica toca. \u00c9 um trabalho excepcional que tem como maior foco o uso do Piano, que tem forte liga\u00e7\u00e3o com a hist\u00f3ria do jogo.\n\nAs m\u00fasicas sozinhas possuem um impacto extremamente forte, principalmente \u00e0queles que conhecem bem o jogo anterior. Uma sensa\u00e7\u00e3o nost\u00e1lgica talvez seja a descri\u00e7\u00e3o inicial para a trilha sonora, que aos poucos se desenvolve em algo \u00fanico, que se adapta perfeitamente ao Finding Paradise. \n\nProvavelmente uma das melhores trilhas sonoras, ao menos com um impacto muito maior nos jogadores, diferente na maioria dos jogos.\n\n[h1]Visuais[/h1]\n\nO pixel art em Finding Paradise \u00e9 excelente. S\u00e3o muitos, mas muitos detalhes nas anima\u00e7\u00f5es de poucos frames, mas que ainda assim trazem uma imers\u00e3o absurda para as cenas. Talvez sejam os efeitos sonoros que contribuem para o impacto das pequenas a\u00e7\u00f5es, mas ainda mant\u00e9m um padr\u00e3o de qualidade visual alt\u00edssimo, mesmo sendo feito em uma engine mais limitada.\n\nUma novidade foi que passaram a usar recursos visuais bem interessantes em alguns momentos, como mudan\u00e7a de \u00e2ngulos e zooms bem feitos, causando maior impacto nas cenas em quest\u00e3o. At\u00e9 mesmo o leve movimentar da c\u00e2mera foi capaz de deixar mais cinematogr\u00e1fico, mais profundo. Um trabalho excepcional com os limites impostos.\n\n[h1]Conclus\u00e3o[/h1]\n\nUma experi\u00eancia \u00fanica, totalmente diferente do seu antecessor, mas que ainda mant\u00e9m o mesmo n\u00facleo que prendeu o cora\u00e7\u00e3o de muitos.\n\nFinding Paradise \u00e9 um jogo incr\u00edvel, feito com muito amor e carinho. Uma hist\u00f3ria emocionalmente envolvente, com uma trilha sonora poderosa, proporcionando uma das experi\u00eancias mais gratificantes que um jogo pode oferecer.

I think it was in the same month it came out, but it always stuck in my head. Like many others, I cried during To the Moon, and even more-so in Finding Paradise. But the point isn't to make you cry, but to tell a beautiful story with meaning. Kan Gao achieved that. \n\nI don't think the game would be the same without the music. It's beautiful. Multiple times I just stopped and listened. Each track was (usually) perfect to the mood of the current scene. I used \"usually\" because there were one or two times that there was some pretty heavy, bittersweet music while something comedic was happening. It didn't bother me too much, but it was noticable.\n\nThe art itself is also very fitting. The pixel art looks very good, but the graphics are improved with the lighting that was used. There were sunshafts in rooms that made some stuff look gorgeous. The backgrounds were very well made too; they were a great accent to the levels.\n\nThe story, as previously stated, was fantastic. It had more layers than To the Moon and additional sideplots that helped set up the story for the next episode (admittedly, it's been such a long time since I've played To the Moon that I might be wrong on this, but this was definitely deeper layered and more meaningful than the first to me). Dr. Rosaline and Dr. Watts are a pleasure to see again. There were less jokes than To the Moon, but this time there was a proper build-up to each of them, which made the jokes funnier. I would love to go deeper into the story, but it's something that you should really experience yourself.\n\nI have not played A Bird Story, but it ties in with Finding Paradise.

IF YOU ARE EXPECTING THIS WILL GIVE YOU THE SAME FEELING THAT TO THE MOON DID, WELL IT WON'T.\n\nNot playing To the moon before only makes you feel some of the doctors' lines being cryptic and you aren't going to get the joke that they are referencing somewhere throughout the game, but not playing A bird story is a huge loss when playing Finding Paradise because Finding Paradise itself doesn't explain enough the main character's odd mind.\nI'm pretty sure that 99% of the customers that bought Finding Paradise are all To the moon player fellows trying to get onto the feel train bounding for the feel villa. But this time it is a totally different story than To the moon. It's true that the producer tried to put some emotional elements to the game but honestly I cannot have any compassion with the main character in the game. Perhaps the main character is a little bit peculiar, and ordinary people cannot share the same feeling that he held.\nI appreciate the tons of new elements, cutscenes, animations, soundtracks that the producer tried hard to build into the game. Compared to To the moon, Finding Paradise is much upgraded, being a lot more similar to a movie than a game. The fantasy elements, the humor, and an excellent way of story telling really suck people's mind into it. However, those are not really what To the moon player folks are expecting. The ending is short, cliche but unsatisfactory. Many reviewers \"shed a tear\" but I'm so sorry that I hardly felt touched. The fact of [spoiler]an imaginary friend[/spoiler] really ruined my mood for the entire opening of the game.\nFor those who haven't played To the moon before, this game is quite entertaining, amusing, and will suprise you at certain points in the game.\nFor the left, maybe FInding Paradise doesn't live up to the expectation of the hype bandwagoners, the shadow of the predecessor is just too great to be surpassed.\n\nExcuse me for the disorganized review and my mediocre Engrish. I am looking forward to the third title and the doctors duo is now a good material for a new story to revolve around it. This sequel did not elaborate enough on all of the occurences of events in the two Minisodes. About the surprising, amusing contents, Finding Paradise did it well and neat.

Visuals are a step up, pacing is smoother sometimes, it all seems more direct. Also, not that TTM necessarily had a problem with this, but there is great chemistry between characters, for the Sigmund crew *and* the people in the patient's memories. This does make the narrative a bit more lighthearted at times, especially in how the \"game\" medium is utilized, but that doesn't detract from its emotional depth and absolutely stellar plot structuring. If you're going to ask me whether I cried or not, I think a lot of \"feels-y\" (for lack of a better term) media like this risks either not fulfilling what it builds up to, or making the reader feel something just for the sake of feeling something. Finding Paradise is PERFECT in avoiding both of these. Moreso than its predecessor. The story's progression feels natural, sappy moments do something for the characters, not just the readers. And as a whole these moments touch on broader themes as well, providing substance while still giving closure. Actually, the ending (final 20min or so?) achieves something surprisingly new.

It felt good to see the two doctors again, and feeling with the patient and all who are envolved in the story.\nI don't want to say anything more, play it on your own, you won't regret it if you loved To The Moon. Enjoy it and have fun!\n\nAll I can say is thank you. Thank you Kan Gao and all the people who were involved in the developing, thank you for creating a perfect sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1513428441, "timestamp_updated": 1513431109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628085", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38349078": {"recommendationid": "38349078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153961485", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513427820}, "language": "english", "review": "Dagnabbit!

Moon\", but makes up for this with its overwhelming good writing and story. It is nice to see that freebird games were able to jump off, \"To the Moon\", rather than feel obliged to make another tear jerker.

Not to give anything away, but i cant wait for the next game in the series.\n\nIf you havent played \"To the Moon\" and its minisodes, i really recommend you do so before playing \"Finding Paradise\".\nIn terms of bird story, playing it may hint at some of the more suprising twists in the story, but i still feel it to be an important part of the experience.\n\nOverall, I am glad freebird games were able to recreate their sucess again. \"Finding Paradise\", will end up being a game i will remember for the years to come.

The music is different from [i] To The Moon [/i], but it is still beautiful to listen to. I found myself not progressing the story at some parts just to close my eyes and listen to the soundtrack. The humor is also extremely well timed and very good, [spoiler] For example using neptune to climb up a building [/spoiler]. \n\nI personally think [i] To The Moon [/i] had a better story, but this is because [i] To The Moon [/i] was completely new so we were overwhelmed with the feelings, whereas in [i] Finding Paradise [/i] we knew what to expect.

I hope Kan won't kill him but judging where the story between Neil and Eva heading, he is going to die/already die, isn't he...[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1513416784, "timestamp_updated": 1513416784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38345519": {"recommendationid": "38345519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317224644", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513415949}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u68d2 \u7ec6\u6c34\u6d41\u957f\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u6700\u52a8\u4eba", "timestamp_created": 1513416719, "timestamp_updated": 1513416719, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38345516": {"recommendationid": "38345516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179535202", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513415663}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u97f3\u4e50\u8fd8\u662f\u4e00\u6837\u7684\u597d\u542c\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u53ca\u683c\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7684\u7206\u53d1\u70b9\u6709\u611f\u52a8\u5230\u3002\u5c31\u662f\u50cf\u5927\u5bb6\u6240\u8bf4\u7684\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u5b89\u6392\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1513416702, "timestamp_updated": 1513416702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38345499": {"recommendationid": "38345499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132058272", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513359179}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5267\u60c5\u548c\u97f3\u4e50\u4e00\u5982\u5373\u5f80\u7684\u68d2\uff0c\u6545\u4e8b\u8fd8\u662f\u6ca1\u731c\u5230\u7ed3\u5c3e\u3002\n\u6574\u4e2a\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\u5f88\u503c\u5f97\u7ec6\u7ec6\u56de\u5473\uff0c\u6bd4\u8d77To the moon\u591a\u4e86\u4e9b\u641e\u7b11\u60c5\u8282\u3002\n\u671f\u5f85ost\u548c\u7eed\u4f5c\u554a\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1513416654, "timestamp_updated": 1513416654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38345490": {"recommendationid": "38345490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092049413", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513416402}, "language": "english", "review": "If you liked To The Moon, you'll feel just the same about Finding Paradise.

[/h1]\nTLDR: The game was great. If you enjoyed To the Moon, this is a must buy!\n\n\n\n[h1] For the rest of you: [/h1]\n\nFirst and foremost, although this game can be played as a stand alone without missing any of the story, there are many references and inside jokes scattered throughout the game linking to To the Moon (along with its minisodes), A Bird Story, and I even think I found a couple references to Rakuen for those who played that game. While you won't really miss out much, if you have the extra money and haven't played those other games (Rakuen not required but it is a great game), I highly suggest playing those games first.\n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\nThe gameplay is fairly similar to To the Moon, in the sense that it is fairly apsent from the game. That is okay though, since the main focus is really on the story. There [i] are [/i] some extra gameplay elements over the first game however, but more or less, the gameplay amounts to fairly the same. They had several extra things where you could switch between which character you controlled which was fairly neat. Inconsequential... but neat. Kan Gao also manages to stick with a similar formula to the previous game while keeping it feeling fresh.\n\n[b] Story [/b]\nAs is a trend with Kan Gao's games, the story is very well done. Of course it deals with very different themes than To the Moon and while the story as a whole didn't move me [i] as [/i] emotionally as To the Moon did, I thought that it was very well done and heartfelt. We also get some expansion on [spoiler] Neil's condition along with some more mysteries that are going on apart from the main storyline. [/spoiler] The game manages to stick to the main storyline while also expanding on some side plots.\n\n[b] Artwork [/b]\nThe artwork in this game just feels generally more polished than it was in To the Moon, from the animations, to details, to expressiveness of the characters. It was very well done. The pixel art was used to great effect in bringing this world to life.\n\n[b] Music [/b]\nThe music was phenominal. Kan Gao delivers another great soundtrack to his game and I was so glad that Laura Shigihara came back to do another song. If you enjoyed the music in To the Moon, you will enjoy the music here. \n\n[b] Faults [/b]\nThat isn't to say that the game lacks any and all faults. Like I saw online, I will agree that the story drags on a bit in the middle of it, though it isn't too bad. Personally, I wasn't able to get attached to these characters quite as easily as in To the Moon, but that may just be me. [spoiler] I didn't really end up caring all that much for the wife and ended up caring more about his childhood friend. [/spoiler] That said, the faults are few and far between and my expectations were definitely met for this game, though I'm not quite sure about exceeded\n\n[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]\nFinding Paradise is a wonderful addition to the To the Moon series which, while it might not obtain the cult status of its predecesor, stands strong in its own right. That being said, I'm not outright saying which game is objectively better, that is fully due to subjectivity. Some may prefer Finding Paradise while others may prefer To the Moon. I think it all depends on your own experiences which is what makes these games so great! We can all relate to it a different way.", "timestamp_created": 1513416327, "timestamp_updated": 1513416391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862",

a baby to To The Moon and bought and played it almost on day 1 and just finished it, so my opinion might be mostly biased of the emotions at the moment\n\nI just did not really enjoy it most of the way\n\nObjectively speaking, the game improved a lot in comparison to To The Moon, even better soundtrack, art, etc\n\nHowever, most of the negatives of its previously title are still there; puzzles that really have no purpose being there besides extending game time, taking too long in order to get from point A to point B to progress through the story (no, making a joke about it and backtracking in general does not redeem the issue), and other \"minigames\" that appear throughout the game did not feel like they had any purpose or even felt good to control, though I appreciate that they give you the option to outright skip them, but the problem is still there\n\nSo these are all issues related to the RPGMAKER engine in general and whatnot, but the real issue is with the most important reason why most people play Freebird's games:\nWriting\n\n[spoiler]SPOILERS AHEAD PROBABLY\nThe story starts up pretty much like To The Moon, same premise, similar situation, etc, like probably everyone expected from its predecessor, however, pretty much the entire setting gets straight up thrown into the trash and replaced with subplots that are really never resolved in the game, such as Watt's pills which are there for no reason but to add tension or drama,  or just straight up teased as a part of future iterations, such as why the hell is Watt doing shit to Sigmund Corps machine, even though it was teased in the minisodes which I didn't really enjoy besides being an epilogue to the base game. Of course I wouldn't really be mad with this twist of \"destroying\" everything that has been set up on act 1, I just felt like at that moment I was not going to get what I expected from this sequel, and instead admitted that I was going to get something else, hoping that it would be good.\n\nBut it wasn't, the following 2 hours of act 2 and most of act 3 was pretty much a mediocre Man vs Computer plot with a bunch of useless exposition, pointless writing and scenes which a lot of referential humor that for me just felt flat on his face, these 2 hours just made me mad enough to just stop feeling or the need to know anything else for any of the characters, even if most of the ending of act 3 felt really nice. Just for some contrast, I was crying like a baby in the bunny's belly scene, whereas in this one I was just mad as fuck and clicking through most of it.\n\nI don't really know what else to say, I expected it to be a emotional story with a few sci-fi and psychological elements thrown in and lightly discussed or shown, but all I got was a shitty Scooby doo cyber chase plot with some feels that didn't really do its job due to what happened previously[/spoiler]\n\nI wrote this review on the heat of the moment so I might change it later but yeah, I do not recommend buying this one yet, it's not worth it, maybe when it goes on sale for a dollar or if you are really a hardcore fan of other freebird games. But if you want to get into Kao Gao games, this is not the one\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1513406283, "timestamp_updated": 1513406283, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0,

You may just tear up, and that's ok. That happened to me. If you want a well crafted story in your games, I must recommend this and To the Moon. They are like bread and butter to each other.\n\nI must say something. This game, is not a game. This game, couldn't even comprehencibly be described as a game. It's not even art at this point.\n\nIt's a f*cking masterpiece.\n\nFor all its faults from its game engine to certain hiccups here and there-all things that I completely don't mind personally-this is the most cleverly made game I have played. \n\nAlso I exagerated at the game part. Which leads me to its improvements. Because it is very much improved since the last 2 games. \n\nTo the Moon was the Stanley Parable before the Stanley Parable. Arguably, To the Moon was the Undertale before Undertale (in that it partially exemplified its trope and genre. Play the original if you really want to know). \n\nFinding Paradise blows To the Moon out of the water. It is very much an improvement with better gameplay, better pacing (not that the pacing in TTM was not that great), and to me a definite, and I MEAN DEFINITE, step up to TTM's story. I will not spoil anything for you in this review, but if you thought To the Moon's story was wild, wait till you experience this one. \n\nCritics of the old game said that To the Moon's gameplay was severely lacking. And that was alright, because games weren't like art forms back when TTM was released. And now that people have credited TTM as inspiring the \"games as art\" form, people enjoyed it so much more. Now, critics of the new game say not much has changed. But SO MUCH HAS CHANGED. \n\nI must end by giving my compliments to the chef. Kan has done soo much to make sure the game completely covered all the critisisms and faults the original game had. And while there are still holes, by god is it a tremendous effort for him and Freebird, and he deserves to be honored for it. As a writer, I am forever inspired by Kan's work, and I hope to see what he has in store for the Sigmund Corp universe.", "timestamp_created": 1513400590, "timestamp_updated": 1513400590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676644", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38341515": {"recommendationid": "38341515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098816636", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513357628}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u53e3\u6c14\u901a\u5173\u4e86\u300aFinding Paradise\u300b\u3002\u5982\u679c\u8bf4\u300aTo The Moon\u300b\u662fRosalene\u548cWatts\u535a\u58eb\u4e3a\u5373\u5c06\u6b7b\u53bb\u7684Johnny Wyles\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53bb\u6708\u7403\u7684\u201c\u613f\u671b\u201c\uff1b\u300aFinding Paradise\u300b\u5219\u662fColin\u5728\u4e34\u6b7b\u524d\u544a\u8bc9\u535a\u58eb\u4e00\u4e2a\u9053\u7406\uff1a\u201c\u9057\u61be\u201c\u540c\u6837\u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u5c31\u4eba\u751f\u3002\u201c\u613f\u671b\u201d\u4e0e\u201c\u9057\u61be\u201d\u770b\u4f3c\u5bf9\u7acb\uff0c\u4f46\u90fd\u662f\u4e00\u751f\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4ece\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u8bb2\u5176\u5b9e\u662f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4ece\u66f4\u9ad8\u5c42\u9762\u6765\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u613f\u671b\u5373\u9057\u61be\u3001\u9057\u61be\u5373\u613f\u671b\u3002\u7ecf\u5386\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u535a\u58eb\u5bf9\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e5f\u6709\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u5427\u3002\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u753b\u98ce\u548cBGM\u4f9d\u65e7\u6709\u975e\u5e38\u9ad8\u7684\u6c34\u51c6\uff0c\u5f88\u7528\u5fc3\uff0c\u60c5\u611f\u6e32\u67d3\u4e5f\u6070\u5230\u597d\u5904\uff1b\u4e0d\u8fc7\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6211\u5bf9\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u300aFP\u300b\u5728\u8282\u594f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u628a\u63a7\u611f\u89c9\u4e0d\u5982\u524d\u4f5c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e2d\u95f4\u7a81\u7136\u52a0\u5165\u7684RPG\u6253\u6597\uff0c\u60c5\u611f\u8f6c\u6362\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7a81\u5140\uff0c\u53e6\u5916\u51e0\u5904\u81f4\u547d\u7a7f\u56feBUG\u4e5f\u6bd4\u8f83\u5f71\u54cd\u6e38\u620f\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u4e0d\u53ef\u591a\u5f97\u7684\u597d\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1513400331, "timestamp_updated": 1513400331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38341433": {"recommendationid": "38341433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357631658", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1513765710}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u63a5\u8fd18\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u901a\u5173\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u8ddf\u901a\u5173to the moon\u540e\u4e00\u6837\u7684\u6e29\u6696\u611f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u90e8\u5927\u6982\u8bb2\u4e86\u9057\u61be\u4e0e\u6210\u957f\u5427\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1513400044, "timestamp_updated": 1513400044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38341321": {"recommendationid": "38341321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099270462", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513399335}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic as expected, Follows the format set by To The Moon while perfecting some of the finer points.

Not this time. This story is a little closer to Earth. Or is it?\n\n\"Finding Paradise,\" the next installment of Kan Gao's fantastic series, is everything I hoped it would be and more. With a delightful mixture of old and new characters, this game will expand the horizons of your mind in ways that you could never have imagined. Where the prequel, \"To the Moon,\" explored the mystery of love, \"Finding Paradise\" instead unravels the mystery of life. \n\nIs it wrong to have regrets? To feel alone? Are the memories we hold closest to us real, or imagined? These are things that every human being wrestles with during their lifetime, and Kan Gao's newest story meets them with the carefulness and wit that his fans have come to expect. Add to that a fanstastic new soundtrack, and \"Finding Paradise\" is sure to become one of your favorites.\n\nYou might cry; you'll probably laugh.

If you didn't, you would be well inspired to give another shot at this much more nuanced entry. And if you haven't played any of these titles and would like to treat yourself with one of the best narrative games available out there, leave this page and throw your wallet at To the Moon. It costs as much as an AAA lootbox, draws you the same amount of tears, but with awesome memories included in the package.\n\nNB : A Bird Story might be a bit of an oddball, but I highly recommend to play it before beginning Finding Paradise.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1513395440, "timestamp_updated": 1513395554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

When compared to \"To the Moon\" I think this game by far has better \"gameplay\"- but the \"gameplay\" still earns the \"'s because you are still not here for that. The story is king, and what we have here is another masterpiece. The music is up to the same standard as To the Moon, the gameplay pacing seems better... The only part which I still think To the Moon wins on is the story, however, that is likely subjective as I simply connected more with To the Moon. Either way, a phenominal story and worth enjoying.\n\nWhile it isn't required for you to play A Bird Story- I suggest you still do. As for To the Moon and minisodes? I'd suggest playing them in their own right, but the game does give you an option to get a little bit of backstory on the core concepts at the start if you don't wish to. This game isn't technologically any different than the first however, so if you are willing to play this game in its current state than you should more than be able to enjoy To the Moon. \n\nOne final thought, be careful with what you read in these reviews. Some have spoiler tags which you may be tempted to mouse over but- don't. Let yourself live this 4 hour story like you did the last one. \n\nOveral, if you couldn't already tell, I highly recommend this game even at full price.", "timestamp_created": 1513394530, "timestamp_updated": 1513394530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38340058": {"recommendationid": "38340058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137109739", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513381088}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you want to cleanse your heart?\nDo you want to find your paradise?\n\n\nPlay this game", "timestamp_created": 1513394318, "timestamp_updated": 1513394318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38340027": {"recommendationid": "38340027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120958516", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513394091}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5e74\u5ea6\u6700\u4f73", "timestamp_created": 1513394156, "timestamp_updated": 1513394156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38339936": {"recommendationid": "38339936", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125496093", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513357698}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc544\uc9c1 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\uac00 \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc548 \ub418\ub294 \uc810\uc740 \uc544\uc27d\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc8fc\uc778\uacf5\ub4e4\uc758 \ub300\uc0ac\uac00 \uc720\uba38\uc2a4\ub7fd\uace0 \uc5b4\ub835\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544\uc11c \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc774\ud574\ud558\uace0 \uc5d4\ub529\uc744 \ubcf4\ub294 \ub370 \ub9c9\ud798\uc774 \uc5c6\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub108\ubb34 \uac10\ub3d9 \u315c\u315c", "timestamp_created": 1513393861, "timestamp_updated": 1513393861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38339894": {"recommendationid": "38339894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061062364", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513393343}, "language": "german", "review": "Ein absolut w\u00fcrdiger Nachfolger von To the Moon", "timestamp_created": 1513393675, "timestamp_updated": 1513393675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38339764": {"recommendationid": "38339764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198233132308", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513392285}, "language": "english", "review": "I kept telling myself during the whole playthrough that it was not To the Moon.

You have new jokes, inside jokes and callbacks, as well as new iterations of long running jokes; there's also plenty of lines and situations that might cut deep depending on your current emotional state and where you feel you are in life right now.\nThe two main character maintain their charm but seem to evolve much less compared to the episode where they were introduced, To The Moon. There seems to be less focus on them and more on moving things forward, both inside the patient's mind and outside. Whether this is a problem of characters, scriptwriting or direction is hard to say. Probably a bit of all.\n\nStill.\n\nOne one hand, working with a well-tested formula allows you you as the author to play it safe and satisfy your audience. On the other hand, treading familiar territory also means that you as the audience have certain degree of prescience (which can vary depending on your innate intuition) that might impair the overall effectiveness of the work.\nThe game, in my opinion, plays it excessively safe, resorting to a few tricks (I'm not using more appropriate words for fear of being too specific and spoiling the game for you) that hide truths you may have seen coming way ahead of time. Trick me once, yatta yatta.\n\nIt's by no means a bad game, on the contrary.\nJust don't expect the same level of impact and emotional rush.\nIt's unlikely to happen because you're already acclimated to Freebird Games' style.", "timestamp_created": 1513390516, "timestamp_updated": 1513390516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38339138": {"recommendationid": "38339138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174141377", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513388973}, "language": "english", "review": "While it didn't make me cry quite as much, \"Finding Paradise\" is as much a beautiful, heart-wrenching story as its predecessor.

It doesn't overburden you with melodrama or pretentiousness; nor does it ever try to wrangle feelings out of you. It simply plays its course, tells its story, and leaves you speechless by the end. Naturally, the waterworks came on for me but they might not do for everyone. I just think it's worth stating, and I do so without shame, that I choked up towards the end of the game.  \n\n\nIn one word, this game is special. \n\n\n\nAs a huge fan of To The Moon -- which no doubt alot of the people purchasing this game are -- I came in somewhat sceptical over wherther or not this game would be able to replicate the magic of it's predecessor. I can safely say that it has met expectations and, in some ways, surpassed them. Even if you haven't played To The Moon, this is an episodic experience and, as such, can be played seperately. That said, I'd still highly recommend you buy To The Moon first and play through it to get that proper sense of continuity and some of the 'in-jokes'. \n\n\n\nI don't really think I need to say much more -- this game is worth it.

I thoroughly enjoyed the whole game and, much like with the original game, felt a strong connection to the characters by the climax of the game.  It is, very similar to the first game.  Freebird Studios have clearly found a formula for their games which works and is effective to tell the story that they wish to tell, and I am delighted to see that they stayed true to that.\n\nA few points need to be stressed if you are considering buying this game, however.  The main one being that if you\u2019re looking for a game with breath-taking graphics, visuals or interactivity/impact on the story, this game is the very antithesis of what you are looking for, and you should pass it by.  It is, a story told almost completely in 16 bit graphics, wherein you are constantly given the chance to explore and are expected to find what needs to be found in order to progress, and while the odd choice is given to you in this game, ultimately, the choices have hardly any impact, and what little impact they do have is made irrelevant after a few minutes.\n\nI cannot stress this enough, this a game designed solely to tell a single linear story, and it does that very well.  So, if you\u2019re looking for a story driven game and want it to be a tearjerker, this is the game for you (along with the prequel To The Moon).  The game sets out with that one clear goal in mind and does a fantastic job filling the large boots left by the first game.\n\nOverall, I am very happy with this game, and look forward to the next episode in this series.", "timestamp_created": 1513386631, "timestamp_updated": 1513386631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38338172": {"recommendationid": "38338172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164177313", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513385568}, "language": "english", "review": "Playing this game will make you birth, whether man or woman, rivers of fluids. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...and a side of XL DEPRESSION.", "timestamp_created": 1513386328, "timestamp_updated": 1513386388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38338135": {"recommendationid": "38338135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076688847", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513402025}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game in my opinion.

Ritengo che ne sia valsa la pena. \nLa storia inizia in maniera piuttosto leggera e \"lineare\" (per modo di dire...), ma a partire dagli atti II e III prende una piega molto pi\u00f9 profonda e interessante, similarmente al primo gioco. Se vi piacciono le storie pensate e che fanno riflettere, questo gioco \u00e8 perfetto.\n\n\n\nLa struttura cita evidentemente quella di TTM, ma viene riproposta con alcune variazioni che riescono a non renderla monotona anche per chi ha gi\u00e0 giocato il primo gioco. Inoltre, rispetto al primo titolo della serie ho evidenziato un forte miglioramento tecnico - non solo come qualit\u00e0 (e quantit\u00e0!) degli sprite usati, ma anche come giocabilit\u00e0: i piccoli minigiochi fra un ricordo e l'altro sono cambiati e meno monotoni, e anche l'atto di raccogliere i singoli momenti (i \"pallini\", per chi mi intende) mi \u00e8 sembrato pi\u00f9 scorrevole e naturale rispetto al primo titolo. \n\nE' all'altezza di To The Moon? \nBeh, il titolo \u00e8 uno standalone, quindi bisogna ricordare che \u00e8 autonomo rispetto al primo, e ritengo che l'intento sia diverso. L'aspetto emotivo - sebbene presente - non riesce a catturare l'animo del giocatore come il primo gioco ha fatto. Ma lo ammetto, TTM \u00e8 l'unico gioco in assoluto che \u00e8 riuscito a farmi quasi piangere - quindi compiere l'impresa una seconda volta sarebbe stato probabilmente impossibile. Detto ci\u00f2, Finding Paradise \u00e8 e resta un esempio di narrativa perfettamente eseguita e che cattura il giocatore (nel mio caso, ho giocato in due sole sessioni, 2+4 ore in meno di una giornata) prima con la simpatia dei personaggi e poi con la storia - sia quella dell'episodio che l'interessantissimo filone conduttore della serie.\n\n\nCome da descrizione, il gioco \u00e8 uno standalone a tutti gli effetti, con una sua storia autoconclusiva. Nonostante questo, consiglierei vivamente a tutti gli interessati di dare prima a un'occhiata agli altri titoli della serie, in quanto senza di essi ci si limita a seguire il singolo caso narrato ma si perdono gli sviluppi della trama generale, a mio parere geniale. Penso sia quindi necessario approcciarsi prima a To The Moon, che introduce il filo conduttore (ed \u00e8 un capolavoro!), ma anche ai due miniepisodi natalizi e a A Bird Story; i primi perch\u00e9 necessari a comprendere la trama che unisce gli episodi, e il secondo in quanto di fatto \u00e8 la spiegazione di una parte importante della vicenda.

It's the sequel to their previous effort, To the Moon, and the second game in a supposed series. Once again the player takes control of two scientists, dr. Eva Rosalene and dr. Neil Watts, employees of a fictional Sigmund Corporation, as they use the technology at their disposal to help a dying man, Colin, achieve happiness by exploring his memories and change them as needed.\n\nSince the game could be considered a direct follow-up to To the Moon, Finding Paradise offers the player the same gameplay as its predecessor. You are basically tasked to visit different memory locations, find all the points of interest and then solve a rather simple, grid-based puzzle mini-game: so once again the core gameplay should be considered just a vehicle for its story, which is arguably the game's main attraction.\n\nOnce again the developers have made a super use of the RPG Maker assets: the environments look absolutely stunning and detailed for this kind of game, the sprites' animations are most of the time incredibly convincing and every once in a while the gameplay will suddendly change, often in humorous and surprising ways which are totally unexpected (in a good way).\n\nWhen it comes to story, Finding Paradise the same quality featured in the original game, and maybe it even surpasses it. The whole game is really a very touching tale about the true meaning of happiness and the role of regrets and mistakes in our live: heavy subjects that the developers managed to take on in a very tasteful manner.\n\nGiven the very low price of the game and the kind of experience you are going to get for yourself I can't see any reason not to reccomend Finding Paradise to anyone", "timestamp_created": 1513372800, "timestamp_updated": 1513372926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38334325": {"recommendationid": "38334325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081649102", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 97, "last_played": 1513714631}, "language": "english", "review": "Dehydration Simulator 2017", "timestamp_created": 1513372390, "timestamp_updated": 1513372390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38334291": {"recommendationid": "38334291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141468609", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513370968}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042f \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043b\u044e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u043d\u0430 RPG Maker, \u0432 \u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0430\u044f-\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0437\u044e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430, \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0434\u0443\u0448\u0430. \u041d\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u043e\u0442 Freebird Games \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438-\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430 RPG Maker, \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0447\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435, \u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0435. \u0414\u0443\u043c\u0430\u044e, \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0449\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0432 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0438\u0434\u0435\u044e \u0432 \u0442\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438,  \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u044e \u043b\u044e\u0431\u044f\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u0434\u0443\u0448\u043e\u0439.

I do feel like these stories would make really good movies.\n\n\nTo any new people, I'd say play To the Moon first.", "timestamp_created": 1513370376, "timestamp_updated": 1513370376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38333406": {"recommendationid": "38333406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219636588", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513366398}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u201c\u90a3\u4e9b\u6211\u9519\u8fc7\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u90a3\u4e9b\u5c0f\u610f\u5916\uff0c\u548c\u6211\u6240\u6709\u672a\u7adf\u7684\u613f\u671b\u2026\u2026\n\u662f\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u8fd8\u662f\u6211\u7684\u9057\u61be\u2026\u2026\n\u53ef\u5b83\u4eec\u8ba9\u6211\u62e5\u6709\u4e86\u73b0\u5728\u7684\u4e00\u5207\u3002\u201d\n\n\u9996\u5148\u97f3\u4e50\u4e00\u5982\u65e2\u5f80\u7684\u597d\u8bc4\uff0c\u5927\u63d0\u7434\u7684\u97f3\u8272\u592a\u6233\u4eba\u4e86\uff01\uff01\n\u4e2a\u4eba\u611f\u89c9\u5267\u60c5\u6df1\u5ea6\u6bd4\u524d\u4f5c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4ece\u5404\u79cd\u89d2\u5ea6\u90fd\u6709\u53ef\u4ee5\u56de\u5473\u7684\u70b9\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u53d7\u4f17\u5e7f\u5ea6\u6050\u6015\u4f1a\u4e0d\u5982\u524d\u4f5c\u3002\u540e\u534a\u6bb5\u7684\u8282\u594f\u7a0d\u5fae\u6709\u70b9\u4e71\u3002\n\u7ed3\u5c3e\u4f9d\u7136\u662f\u6700\u51fa\u5f69\u7684\uff0c\u770b\u5b8c\u4e4b\u540e\u6709\u79cd\u60f3\u8981\u8bf4\u4e9b\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u53c8\u89c9\u5f97\u4ec0\u4e48\u90fd\u4e0d\u5fc5\u518d\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u5c31\u633a\u597d\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u3002\u679c\u7136\u8fd8\u662f\u8fd9\u79cd\u5706\u6ee1\u7684\u7ed3\u5c40\u6bd4\u8f83\u8ba9\u4eba\u5fc3\u91cc\u8212\u5766\u3002\n\u7a7f\u63d2\u5728\u5185\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u73a9\u6897\u548c\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\u633a\u6709\u8da3\u7684\uff0c[spoiler]\u6254\u978b\u5b50\u905b\u72d7\u771f\u7684\u7b11\u51fa\u58f02333[/spoiler]\n\n\u53e6\u5916\u524d\u4f5c\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u8fc7\u7684Neil\u7684\u602a\u5f02\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ed3\u5c3e\u65f6\u7684\u7ea2\u5149\u95ea\u70c1\u679c\u7136\u662f\u4f5c\u8005\u6316\u7684\u5751\uff0c[strike]\u800c\u4e14\u611f\u89c9\u8d8a\u6316\u8d8a\u5927\u4e86[/strike]\u2026\u2026\n---------------------------------\n\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u534a\u5929\u4e5f\u6ca1\u641e\u5b9a\u600e\u4e48\u7528steam\u622a\u56fe\uff0c\u6539\u4e86\u5feb\u6377\u952e\u4e5f\u6ca1\u7528\u2026\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1513369667, "timestamp_updated": 1513370039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38333346": {"recommendationid": "38333346", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082697310", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513353334}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely amazing story.

Not saying they are bad. I'm just saying we gamers have a general conception of \"more realistic the graphics, better the game\" these days.

This is preventing us from even trying out something indie, like To The Moon. \n\nEven so, just look at the numbers of dedicated Freebird fans. I don't think they heard the game from advertisements.

Keep in mind, however, that I appreciate these games not just for being emotional, but because they give insight into people's inner selves and desires, what makes us what we are, and how complicated the sum of what makes us, 'us', is.\nAnd approaching Finding Paradise from this direction, I can say it's a great success like its predecessor was.\n\nEverything about Finding Paradise is amplified and refined compared to To the Moon. Its visuals are prettier and more detailed, with more expressive and animated character sprites that really bring the world to life. Soundtrack is amazing, and rearranged leitmotifs from To the Moon makes me feel at home, being in the company of the doctors.\nStoryline is also expanded: intrique is built up very well, and there's more story happening outside the actual job this time around. The story beats feel familiar, while also building up its mystery in a less straightforward, more ambiguous manner. It isn't totally unpredictable, but Kan Gao has certainly improved in making things have more than meets the eye.\n\nWhile the good parts of To the Moon are amplified, the same applies to the flip side. There are still some tonal inconsistencies, accompanied by Watts' signature video game riffing. At one point it goes to new heights in a very jarring way that feels completely redundant. The puzzle-solving gameplay is still just kind of there, but it doesn't get in the way of the narrative, so I digress. There's also some missed potential with the game's themes, but I won't go in-depth with it. Most of my issues with the narrative cluster in the final act of the game, so they're not persistent problems, but they keep me from singing very high praises of the game.\n\nIn the end I still think Finding Paradise stands tall next to To the Moon, even if it might not gain the same cult status. If you have any love for To the Moon or an appreciation for video game narratives, don't miss out.\nIt's definitely a worthy experience and a legitimate expansion of the original's worldbuilding and ethical musings.", "timestamp_created": 1513364967, "timestamp_updated": 1513364967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.726834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38331774": {"recommendationid": "38331774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147246131", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513362437}, "language": "english", "review": "Finding Paradise tells a story that can be relevant to many, but it is one that goes untold in our society due to the nature of the topic. None of it was what I was expecting, and the game was more personal for me than To the Moon.\n\nSimilar to To the Moon, you will have a type of puzzle to solve as you go along, and you will find mementos to unlock memories. Don't expect the puzzle to be the same as To the Moon though. There is new music heard throughout the game, and there are also new renditions of music from To the Moon. Occasionally, there are corny scenes, and one felt a bit longer than I'd like (thanks a lot Neil). I would say that A Bird Story is an important part of understanding the patient. It hints at the patient's secret more than one might think.\n\nAlthough the game is slightly shorter than To the Moon, it is just as meaningful, or more meaningful for those who can relate to Finding Paradise.

We've experienced it and grown from it. It's done its job. \nThis game is the natural progression from that. While in some ways To The Moon taught us about love and finding strength in someone else, Finding Paradise shows us the importance of loving yourself and finding strength within, along with other lessons about life, regrets, and what-ifs.\n\nOf course I could just be taking out of my ass here, but that's what I get from it.

Cannot go wrong with that (y)\n\n\n\nEdit: No matter what I write, I know I cannot do this game justice just by my own words, because it's just that great. But still, I really feel like I should at least give an analysis/comparison of this, especially for the sake of people who have previously played To The Moon. Keep in mind that this will contain no spoilers.\n\n\n\n[b]1)[/b] In To The Moon, the feeling of sadness is more distributed throughout the whole series kind of equally, by that I mean the parts where you travel from memory to memory, each memory had it's own \"aww\" moment that makes you feel sad, if that makes any sense to you. \nIn Finding Paradise, the sad parts are more isolated from the happier ones. \n\n[b]2)[/b] To The Moon had a great sense of humor, but in Finding Paradise you'll probably see yourself laughing even more often. Yeah, I guess this game has more parts that are funny than parts that are tragic compared to To The Moon. But still reminding you, both are pretty sappy stories.\n\n[b]3)[/b] A finale with a great tearjerker potential -> checked. Exists in both games.\n\n[b]4)[/b] Both games have this mystery surrounding the patients at the start of the game. While playing Finding Paradise, even though you'll find yourself scratching your head and trying to come up with many different possibilities and scenarios in your head early on, but soon you'll probably guess what is going on before the game tells straight to your face. To the Moon nailed the mystery part much better and was much harder to predict, at least that's my opinion of it.\n\n[b]5)[/b] I know very few people didn't enjoy To The Moon as much for it being \"too pretentious\". While I don't share their sentiments (I liked To The Moon very much), I still can see where they are coming from. I mean, 8 year old children philosophizing about the meaning of stars and the loneliness and stuff, and a main character whose emotions and actions are incredibly hard to understand (River).\nFinding Paradise keeps it less pretentious in that aspect, while not losing any depth. For most of the time, you will understand the actions and motivations of all characters involved, and it will make sense. \n\n[b]6)[/b] The patient in Finding Paradise has a much more interesting character and a great sense of humor compared to Johnny from To The Moon (at least in my opinion :P )\n\n[b]7)[/b] Finding Paradise has more \"gameplay\" moments, though I personally found that a little bit too distracting from the main story, even though they were generally comedic moments more than anything, take this as however you will.\n\n[b]8)[/b] How could I forget this? This should go without saying anyways. Both have equally amazing, hauntingly beautiful soundtrack. \n\n\nAll in all, there's no reason you wouldn't love this if you loved To The Moon. Both are very great, and a must play if you are into story driven indie games.", "timestamp_created": 1513357119, "timestamp_updated": 1513536001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591216", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38328895": {"recommendationid": "38328895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084942080", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1513751479}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u672c\u4f5c\u7684bgm\u4e00\u5982\u524d\u4f5c\u7d20\u8d28\u6781\u9ad8\uff0c\u7edd\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u642d\u914d\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u5230\u4f4d\uff0c\u5b8c\u7f8e\u70d8\u6258\u51fa\u4e86\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6c1b\u56f4\u3002\n\u5267\u60c5\u4e0d\u8f93\u524d\u4f5cto the moon\uff0c\u4e3a\u9632\u5267\u900f\u5c31\u4e0d\u591a\u8bf4\u4e86\u3002\u53e6\u5916\u8fd8\u4e3a\u7eed\u4f5c\u6316\u4e86\u4e0d\u5c11\u5751\u3002\n\u611f\u8c22Kan Gao\u5728\u8fd912\u6708\u5e26\u7ed9\u6211\u4eec\u8fd9\u6837\u4e00\u90e8\u6e29\u6696\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1513356880, "timestamp_updated": 1513356880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38328862": {"recommendationid": "38328862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056735088", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513355512}, "language": "english", "review": "I played To The Moon shortly after it was released, and have been waiting attentively for this over 6 years.

For me, I've waited 3 years and I can honestly say it did [b]not[/b] leave me disappointed.\n\n[i]Finding Paradise[/i] may be the second episode of the [i]To the Moon[/i]... series...? but it's able to function as a standalone title. There are a handful of jokes that might go over your head if you haven't played the first installment (I'm looking at you, squirrel), but nothing that takes away from the enjoyment of the game. In fact, you have the choice of skipping through the dialogue of how the Sigmund Corp. works if you don't want or don't need it. If you have played it before, you'll definitely get a few extra laughs out of the dialogue and one or two familiar locations.\n\nI initially thought the story was going to be predictable, but boy was I wrong. About halfway through the game, I sat there proudly thinking I'd solved the problem and was just waiting for Neil and Eva to confirm everything for me. Needless to say, they did not. In fact, the only thing I was able to guess correctly was the significance of the green book. I truly appreciated the game's ability to keep me guessing; I kept flipflopping between what I thought was actually going on with the technology, and with Colin's memories.\n\nI also found the story narrative to be believable. It was able to maintain its futuristic elements while still somehow being grounded firmly in reality, especially the emotional aspects of the game. I recall a lot of negative criticism on Neil's poor comedic timing in the first installment, and I think that's been addressed here. The humor is appropriate and we're able to appreciate the more somber scenes without interruption from jokes or puns. Moreover, the dialogue itself feels a more natural and not quite as stilted as it sometimes came off in the first installment.\n\nEven though I loved [i]To the Moon[/i], I was worried that a similar gameplay idea would make the game stale or boring, but thankfully that's not the case. You still have to find mementos, but breaking the barrier is a bit easier (and more challenging, depending). The patient is a unique individual, which also helps the games from being too similar.\n\nOne more gameplay aspect is the idea of choice. While the opportunities to make decisions are few in number, they are, for the most part, pretty meaningful. They allow the player to see the morality of Neil and Eva, especially Neil who has opportunities to break protocol and handles such times in a unique manner.\n\nAs expected, the music was phenomenal. I enjoyed the remixes of familiar songs from [i]To the Moon[/i], but the new songs were just as amazing. They all fit the mood and the settings, and for those who have played the first game the music will definitely be nostalgic. As I expected, Laura Shigihara made a return to sing another beautiful piece.\n\nOverall, I feel this game is an absolute gem. It's reasonably priced for a game that's a little over 5 hours long with decent replayability, and if you enjoyed  [i]To the Moon[/i] you'll probably enjoy  [i]Finding Paradise[/i].

In most video games, we are supposed to avoid death to win. In Finding Paradise and To the Moon, we explore this issue of death instead, as well as the struggles that a dying person may have when they realize their life is almost over. Both games have meaningful messages, that have made me a better person.\n\nWhile To the Moon gave huge emotional impact to most people who played it, I think Finding Paradise will have bigger emotional impact on lonely people,[spoiler]especially those who had an imaginary friend when they were growing up[/spoiler]. To me, the last few scenes really hit home, and I couldn't help but got very emotional and broke down in tears. Such a beautiful and inspiring story! Definitely worth the price, even more.

Dr. Neil Watts, welche in Auftrag von der Sigmund Corp ihren Patienten versuchen vor deren Tod ein neues Leben zu erm\u00f6glichen.\nIn diesen Fall sollen sie Colin Reeds zu einen neuen Leben verhelfen, aber ist das \u00fcberhaupt erw\u00fcnscht....?\n\nFinding Paradise ist ein ausgereiftes und wundersch\u00f6nes Spiel, welches vom Entwicklerstudio Freebird Studio ver\u00f6ffentlich wurde. Die musikalische Begleitung des Spiel ist einzigartig sowie der Witz, dass mehrere kleine aber feine Minigame mit einprogramiert worden sind macht Finding Paradise zu einen sehr guten 5. Spiel der Sigmund Corps. Reihe, wobei die letzte Szene mich pers\u00f6nlcih aufregt, da uns wieder etwas der geheimen Geschichte hinter den Spielen angeteasert wird, was wir aber erst in den n\u00e4chsten Teilen der

game that in my opinion only hase one big issue: The game engine. That being said, the limitations it brings only really bother me on two fronts: Resolution and diagonal movement. Being forced into a 1999-level resolution doesn't do it many favors since it pretty much leaves you with a weird resolution change or has you play in a small window which is why they'll do the switch to something more appropriate for any potential further games. \n\nThe gameplay mechanics themselves are appropriate for a game with that much focus on narrative. It doesn't hit nearly as hard as To The Moon did, but that isn't a bad thing in itself.\n\nIf you've liked To The Moon, you'll like this one as well.

I cried just as much as by playing \"To the moon\".\nThe music is also amazing and so fitting. Great work here also from Laura Shigihara.\nIf you loved the story of Johnny and River then BUY THIS GAME ASAP! You will love it! I promise! For real!

Everything great about the previous game was polished to a mirror shine: the main duo is as eccentric as ever, the overarching plot and mystery are more interesting, and the soundtrack is, again, amazing.\n\nWhile TTM took a fairly straightforward, heartwrenching story but told it backwards, Finding Paradise has a more complicated structure, and deals with more themes and ideas than TTM. The focus, I feel, isn't about making you cry as much as it is about making you think about life (as well as other specifics I won't spoil).\n\nThat being said, the gameplay loop is much of the same. You'll still be pointing and clicking your way through environments, trying to find that last damn memory orb. You'll play arbitrary match-3 games and do lots and lots of reading. It all still works, but it started to grate on me by the end. There are some jokes and plot points that just didn't work for me, especially in the last part, but the game redeems itself by the end.\n\nIt's good, it's emotional, it's surprisingly philosophical,

But Finding Paradise stands for different plot. It spins around a man (Colin Reeds) who was having a normal life, in which he doesn't have any tragic lost (like To The Moon's Johnny Wyles). But Colin, is having an imaginary friend in his youth (which was some kind of mental issue of schizophrenia). The only loss he's gotten into was he's moved on way far from his imaginary friend. And I'd like to say it's very touching. Because, Colin has the very life he's always wanted, yet he lost a part of himself he was longed for. [/spoiler]\n\nThanks again, Kan Gao.\nFinal words and rating: 10/10 for giving us the story that deliver different feels from To The Moon. But still touching our heart to an extend. [spoiler] Thank you for giving me the understanding that when you get life exactly what you wanted, you gotta sacrifice something to earn it.

I ended up shooting through the entire game in one sitting. Just goes to show you how engaging the story is.\n\nAnyway, this is the sequel to 2011's indie hit To The Moon, though you don't need to play that one to enjoy Finding Paradise. Even so, I still think you should play To The Moon first. I'm finding the Sigmund Corps. series to work like the original Star Trek episodes: some move your heart, others make you think. This is more of a thinking piece than an emotional love story, but it is still rather emotional and I did almost cry at the end of the game. Still, I find that playing To The Moon, will help you understand the basics of this alternate future and how the technology can be used to help others. This game puts those mechanics and morals under scruntiny and asks if messing with one's memories is really nescessary to give someone a happy ending, which is why playing To The Moon first will help you appreciate the conversations more.\n\nThat's not to say this game is without humor. Our favorite scientists, Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts, are back to snark and make terrible puns. To The Moon made some nerdy references, but this game goes full-out on the references. The memories themselves have some fun moments too, mostly because the game's subject is quite an imaginative sort himself. But even the scientists get some great character moments and rather suspicious motives. What are you up to, Neil...?\n\nFinally, the game's art and animation improved a lot since To The Moon. The character sprites are tiny, but you can still get a lot of emotions out of them. The puzzles and minigames were also much more engaging, though a bit trickier than To The Moon. Or maybe because I suck at video games. XD And the music in particular was really moving, mostly because the characters are musicians and have a connection to music. Some To The Moon tracks do return, but the new pieces do shine brightly. \n\nIf there is one thing I want to nitpick, it is the search for memory links. Most of the time you can find what you'e looking for, but ther were times where something wasn't obvious until I did a mouse-clicking frenzy on the screen. Not sure if it was just me or what, just something to keep in mind.\n\nOverall, great experience and great time.

Do not come with certain expectations obtained from To The Moon, as this game attempts to establish a more broad tale through worldbuilding and foreshadowing rather than serve as a single, beautiful tearjerker. \n\nNoticeable performance issues (likely due to the platform this game was built on), and creative-yet-slightly-distracting mechanics which can divert attention from the intended atmosphere a little too strongly. Characters had some flat qualities, and plot was haphazard at crucial moments which replaced some mysteriousness with simple confusion.\n\nWill definitely remain a devoted fan after another incredible game. As a writer and dreamer, I was able to connect in a very personal way to the essence of this story. I am looking forward to more planned-out, well-executed pieces in the years to come. With lower expectations of sentimentality, I will be able to more fully enjoy the next game by focusing on the story as a whole, rather than expecting a heart-rending one-liner.\n\nThank you, Kan Gao, as well as everyone else who has worked in or collaborated with Freebird Games, for putting so much passion and love in an RPG Maker game which really means something -  in a world where big video game companies are heartlessly and shamelessly scrounging for cash.", "timestamp_created": 1513330608, "timestamp_updated": 1513330608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38320248": {"recommendationid": "38320248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101672117", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513329593}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ef7\u683c\u6bd4\u53bb\u6708\u7403\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u8fd8\u662f\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0d\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u7cbe\u795e\u98df\u7cae\uff0c\u98df\u7684\u503c\u3002[strike] \u4e70\u5c31\u662f\u4e86\t[/strike]\n\n\u505a\u4e00\u4e0b\u7b80\u8bc4\u5427\n\n\u5267\u60c5\uff1a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5267\u60c5\u73a9\u5bb6\u6211\u4e0d\u592a\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u8bc4\u6d4b\u91cc\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd8\u662f\u6709\u4e24\u70b9\u8981\u8bf4\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u6ca1\u6709\u53bb\u6708\u7403\u90a3\u7684\u6734\u5b9e\u81ea\u7136\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f9d\u65e7\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u6211\u4e2a\u4eba\u611f\u89c9\u98ce\u683c\u6709\u4e86\u70b9\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\uff0c\u6211\u5976\u8981\u51fadlc\u548c\u7eed\u4f5c\uff08\u5176\u5b9e\u4e0d\u7528\u5976\u4e5f\u770b\u5f97\u51fa\uff09\n\n\u6e38\u620f\u6027\uff1aemmm\u8fd9\u4f5c\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\u7a0d\u5fae\u591a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e22\u4e22\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6211\u611f\u89c9\u8fd8\u4e0d\u7b97\u592a\u7b80\u5355\u4e0d\u8fc7\u597d\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6e38\u620f\u8fdb\u7a0b\uff0c\u53e6\u5916\u7ffb\u65b9\u5757\u8fd9\u6b21\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u4e09\u6d88\u6211\u611f\u89c9\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u5982\u7ffb\u65b9\u5757\u7684\u2026\u2026\u867d\u7136\u4e5f\u4e0d\u96be\u3002\n\n\u97f3\u4e50\uff1a\u57fa\u672c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u548c\u53bb\u6708\u7403\u4e00\u6837\u7684\u6c34\u51c6\uff0ced\u4e5f\u5f88\u597d\u542c\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u50cf\u53bb\u6708\u7403\u4e00\u6837\u80fd\u6df1\u5165\u6211\u5fc3\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u66f2\u3002\n\n\u53ef\u80fd\u5267\u900f\n\n[spoiler] \u8fd9\u5bb6\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u4eba\uff0c\u6015\u662f\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u75c5\u4eba\u7ed3\u7f18\u4e86\t[/spoiler]\n\n\u6545\u4e8b\u4f9d\u65e7\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u5bb9\u6613\u8ba9\u4eba\u4ece\u5404\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u53bb\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u987a\u4fbf\u8bf4\u4e00\u4e0b\u6211\u672c\u4eba\u5176\u5b9e\u548c\u98de\u884c\u5458\u4e3b\u89d2\u89c2\u5ff5\u6709\u70b9\u50cf\uff0c\u55ef\u7b80\u8bc4\u5c31\u8fd9\u6837\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1513330210, "timestamp_updated": 1513330210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38320176": {"recommendationid": "38320176", "author": {"steamid": "76561198342453506", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513521669}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u4e00\u6837\u7684\u611f\u52a8", "timestamp_created": 1513329969, "timestamp_updated": 1513329969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38320169": {"recommendationid": "38320169", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058790507", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "last_played": 1514154158}, "language": "english", "review": "I would Highly Recommend anyone who plan on playing this game to play bird story right before it.\n\nSo it finally arrived. I was literally counting date before this game was released, purchased as soon as it got onto the store, finished it just now. To start off, as always, writing review about this game is hard just like To the moon, simply because I do not want to spoil anything, and so much things are floating on my head and I am not sure if I can really write it too well about it. \n\nI am planning on re playing this game sooner or later simply because there are many things that I felt like I missed and some stuffs I couldnt fully understand, so I will have to give a second run for this game. \n\nFor Music, as always I would like to give 10/10. To the moon made an awesome music pieces, very repetitive, but very addictive. Compare to To the Moon series, I would say that I liked To the moon music bit more (I started playing Piano after playing To the moon as well), but that is only in comparison to To the moon. Compare to other games of this genre, I would give 10/10 without hesitation.  Especially the main theme, \"Time is a place\" is such an awesome piece.\n\nFor story, story of finding paradise is very different from To the Moon. I wouldnt approach this game thinking we will have some kind of heartbreakening love story that will make you shed with tears. Rather, this is story about man, story about his life. \n\nHow should I put it... Playing To the Moon feels as if you are watching well made drama or novel about love story. It isnt story about us. It is story about River and Johnny. It is story about them. However, Finding Paradise is bit different. It feels as if it is a story about me, story about you, and story about all of us. There is no such thing as heartbreakening love story. Rather,  it is story about our life. Our past, present, future, regrets, dreams, fulfillment, friends, lovers, children, and goes on. \n\nPlaying to the moon made me shed a tear. After playing Finding Paradise, however, I find myself sitting on a chair at 4am, with so many thoughts about myself, my past, my present, my future, and about my life. I do not know, or I cannot say whether playing this game has any impact about my own life or not, but what I can say for sure is that playing this game has changed how I view about who I am.\n\nIs this game better than To the Moon? I do not know, you may love To the Moon but may say meh, story of finding paradise was so-so. Simply because To the Moon makes you much more emotional, whereas finding paradise makes you feel tranquil. \n\nThanks Ken Gao for creating such an awesome game. \n\nJust piece of advice for people who are planning on playing this game, do not rush it, just take it slow and read each lines slowly and do not miss anything out. Give yourself whole day, and just play from Bird story to Finding Paradise. If you take this slow, it will give you unforgettable moment after you finish the game.\n\nAnd lastly, dont try to judge this game. Dont try to judge meh compare to To the Moon, its not that emotional, it is not as \"new\" as it is. Just take the story slowly and go with the flow. I think a lot of time we miss good things because we are too busy judging them.\n\nThank you and have fun.", "timestamp_created": 1513329917, "timestamp_updated": 1513364689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38320137": {"recommendationid": "38320137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188593201", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 352, "last_played": 1514314287}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u5e76\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6211\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u4e86\u4e2d\u6587\u6587\u5b57\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u5b98\u65b9\u65e9\u65e5\u4fee\u590d", "timestamp_created": 1513329786, "timestamp_updated": 1513329786, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438732", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38320109": {"recommendationid": "38320109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259489137", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513329354}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6545\u4e8b\u4e2d\u770b\u5230\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5f71\u5b50\uff0c\u7f8e\u597d\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u603b\u662f\u76f4\u51fb\u4eba\u5fc3\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4e5f\u4f1a\u6210\u4e3a\u4eba\u751f\u4e2d\u7f8e\u4e3d\u7684\u56de\u5fc6\u7684\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1513329675, "timestamp_updated": 1513329675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38320060": {"recommendationid": "38320060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097135190", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513378473}, "language": "norwegian", "review": "Great game, music improved since To The Moon and the atmosphere is also improved.

que la mayoria de las reviews son en ingl\u00e9s y se que hay gente que apenas y entiende el ingl\u00e9s, agarrense que esta rese\u00f1a viene con spoilers, si no quieres spoilers solo salteate hasta los \"pros\" y \"contras\", no se preocupen, pondr\u00e9 el texto que tenga spoiler con la etiqueta \"spoiler\", as\u00ed que no la ver\u00e1n a menos que pasen el raton encima [/b]\n\nPrimero empezamos con una intro como To the moon la hizo, el juego combina comedia con momentos tristes e inclusive, por loco que suene hay \"acci\u00f3n\", y en efecto, el juego es una secuela tanto de To the moon como de A bird story, realmente no importa mucho si no jugaste los anteriores, como dijo Kan Gao en un comentario hace un dia \"no es necesario que juegues to the moon o a bird story, debido a que son historias diferentes\", aunque, recomiendo al menos jugar \"A bird story\" debido a que hay algunas referencias que quiza puedas quedarte como de \"\u00bfporqu\u00e9 menciono eso?\" o \"\u00bfsobre que cosa esta hablando \u00e9l?\"\n \n[spoiler]\nBueno, vamos con la historia, la historia ronda alrededor de Colin, es un ex-piloto el cual llevaba piloteando desde que era un adulto, es el mismo protagonista de A bird story, pero en este caso en su lecho de muerte, el cual, se menciona que contrata a las industrias sigmund  para poder cumplir su sue\u00f1o, el cual consiste en que quiere ser feliz, pero, Colin especifica muy en claro que quiere que se modifique lo menos posible de sus recuerdos, dado que no quiere olvidar nada. Feliz es una palabra muy dificil de interpretar, porque para lo que alguien es felicidad, para otro puede no serlo, esto da muchos dolores de cabeza a Eva y Neil debido a que no saben por donde empezar ya que no tienen un \"punto\" al cual llegar, debido a que no hay un deseo especifico, a diferencia de To the moon, en donde Neil y Eva realmente ten\u00edan un \"punto\" al cual llegar, que era llevar a Jonnhy a la luna, era ir desde atras hac\u00eda delante. En este caso, ellos se encuentran en una espiral, me explico, cuando visitan el recuerdo de Colin anciano, al capturar los mementos, se van inmediatamente hasta el Colin ni\u00f1o, lo cual, en teoria es \"ilogico\" porque no puedes saltarte toda una vida entera con un solo recuerdo u objeto preciado; hasta este punto sabemos que Colin esta casado y tiene un hijo, pero, al viajar a sus recuerdos cuando este era ni\u00f1o, nos damos cuenta de un interes \"amoroso\" que ten\u00eda Colin con una vecina de \u00e9l, que vivia enfrente de su departamento llamada Faye. Conforme avanza la historia, Neil y Eva se percatan que las cosas no cuadran, por que conforme mas van retrocediendo (del Colin anciano al Colin \"adulto\") y avanzando (del Colin ni\u00f1o al Colin \"adulto\") se forma una espiral como dije, y llega a un punto intermedio que es con Colin adulto, se percatan que hay momentos \"ilogicos\" debido a que, en los recuerdos posteriores a Colin adulto, Faye nunca es mencionada como si nunca hubiera existido, ni su esposa la recuerda, mientras que, los momentos anteriores a Colin adulto, Faye siempre esta al lado de Colin, apoyandolo y siendo su amiga. Cuando esan apunto de llegar al \"medio\" de todos los recuerdos, Neil sale un momento a hacer un papeleo urgente y deja a Eva dentro de la maquina para encontrar un memento que les resultaba imposible encontrar, minutos despues, Neil recibe una llamada de Eva de manera urgente, avisandole que investigue los datos sobre Faye, debido a que, sospecha que ella es la causante del problema con Colin, solamente para percatarse que no existe ninguna \"Faye\" registrada, osea, nunca existi\u00f3 una tal Faye en el mundo; despues de eso, Neil recibe otra llamada, y al parecer, est\u00e1 se corta debido a un problema con la maquina, por lo que Neil entra rapidamente a la maquina, solo para percatarse que Eva se encuentra desaparecida y darse cuenta que Faye tiene conciencia propia y puede controlar todo en la mente de Colin; Faye, les pide a \u00e9l y a Eva que se retiren de la mente de Colin, debido a que el problema de Colin inicialmente fue las industras sigmund; comienzan una pelea Neil y Faye para \"eliminarse\" uno al otro, pero, llega un punto en el que ella es derrotada por Eva, ya que, logra salir de la maquina y de alguna manera color sedantes en la mente de Colin, que era la que estaba dandole todo ese \"poder\" a Faye, una vez tranquilizada pueden seguir haciendo su trabajo, pero, \u00a1oh sorpresa!, tienen poco tiempo debido a que los sedantes no duraran mucho y el cuerpo de Colin ya no aguantar\u00e1 m\u00e1s, su muerte esta cerca; logran conseguir el ultimo memento para entrar al ultimo recuerdo de Colin (el de su \"adultez\"), una vez ah\u00ed, en ese recuerdo, Colin esta apunto de irse lejos, ya que esta apunto de cumplir su sue\u00f1o de ser piloto de aviones (que me falto agregar, que dicho deseo fue influenciado por Faye) y no podr\u00e1 ver a Faye en mucho tiempo; despues de una charla entre ellos 2, se revela la verdad, Faye NO ES alguien real, si no, es un \"amigo imaginario\" creado por Colin desde la ni\u00f1ez que lo acarreo hasta su adultez, esto debido a que, como se mostro en A bird story (y aqu\u00ed se menciona en un recuerdo), Colin siempre estaba solo debido al trabajo de sus padres, por lo que, no tenia amigos, era solitario, y eso le forzo a hacerse un amigo imaginario; Faye le menciona a Colin que es tiempo de que la \"olvide y crezca\", que tiene todavia una vida por delante en el mundo \"real\", despues de un momento emotivo, Colin acepta la realidad y olvida a Faye, dejandola ir para siempre, pero esta, antes de irse le recuerda que volver\u00e1 en alg\u00fan momento, para que Colin le cuente todo lo que ha hecho de su vida. Al final, Eva y Neil siguen dentro de la mente de Colin, y Faye esta libre ahora debido a que los sedantes se terminaron, pero tienen que salir ya debido a que Colin esta apunto de fallecer, por lo que, en ultima instancia, Neil se da cuenta de todo, la raz\u00f3n por la que Colin no \"podia ser feliz del todo\" era por que Faye nunca regreso y al enterarse de las industrias Sigmund \u00e9l quer\u00eda verla de nuevo lo cual, para Faye, era malo, debido a que quer\u00eda que Colin creciera y viviera plenamente; por ultima instancia, Neil le da control absoluto sobre la mente de Colin a Faye, y esta, ya en su lecho de muerte y en su vejez, aparece por ultima vez para desaparecer de sus recuerdos a las industrias sigmund y porder despedirse de \u00e9l para siempre, adem\u00e1s de disculparse por haber desaparecido y nunca regresar, y lo \u00faltimo que Colin le dice al morir es: \"No tienes porque disculparte, muchas gracias por haber sido la \u00fanica amiga que tuve\" y posterior a eso, Colin muere.\n\nPerdon si me trague acentos, comas, etc... lo escrib\u00ed muy noche y ten\u00eda demasiadas lagrimas en los ojos hahaha (no es broma, si es real)\n[/spoiler]\n\nPros:\n- Gr\u00e1ficas mejoradas (no esperes nada realista, pero, realmente se nota mucha mejora en los dise\u00f1os y animaciones)\n- La m\u00fasica (a pesar que se reciclan una que otra tonada de To the moon, en su mayoria el soundtrack es nuevo y muy muuuuuuy emotivo)\n- Buena combinaci\u00f3n tanto en \"bromas\" y momentos emotivos, nunca se salen del contexto\n- Duraci\u00f3n \"buena\" (alrededor de 5-6 horas)\n\nLo meh:\n- Idioma (realmente estaba considerando si ponerlo o no, el ingl\u00e9s que emplea el juego no es \"complejo\", con que sepas lo b\u00e1sico del ingl\u00e9s ya lo dominaste, aunque, se que para muchas personas, el hecho de tener una historia y no saber tanto ingl\u00e9s les causa muchos problemas)\n- Historia enredada (esto va de la mano con lo del ingl\u00e9s, digamos que la historia es algo rebuscada, pero no por eso es mala, es excelente, de hecho me atrevo a decir que Kan Gao pudo superar la de To the moon)\n\nLo malo:\n-Quiz\u00e1 el unico punto que le veo malo es la \"resolucion\" si lo escalas con \"Alt + enter\" te abre el modo pantalla completa, pero que pasa, esta limitado a 640 x 480, por lo que no puedes cambiar de pesta\u00f1a sin hacer que tu windows se mueva en el escritorio\n\n10/10, realmente es muy recomendable, tiene buen precio, as\u00ed que, que esperas; traigan pa\u00f1uelos :'u", "timestamp_created": 1513326090, "timestamp_updated": 1513326557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38319296": {"recommendationid": "38319296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031444201", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513325925}, "language": "english", "review": "Finding Paradise is a direct continuation of the incredible universe of To the Moon.

They have managed to tell a story that is witty, warm, and in some ways educational. Without spoiling details from either To The Moon or this game, I can say that both titles work wonders in exploring the concepts of mind, memory, and mental health. They do not shy away from the rougher edges of the human condition, and in doing so tell genuine and heart-tugging tales.\nIn short, if you like narrative driven games, buy this and To The Moon( and, should you feel so inclined, A Bird Story, though I actually recomend this after playing the other two). They are both masterpieces in their own right.\nBe aware that these games are not so much \"games\" as they are interactive novellas( though this one does have a few refreshing gameplay tweaks here and there) That's about all I can say if you're new to the franchise.\n\nNow, I will talk to the home crowd, the ones that have been waiting for this for ages. I will be frank: this is not the same kind of story as To The Moon, and does not hit as universally as the romance between Johnny and River. What we get, in my opinion is no less powerful, even if it isnt as universal. I still felt endeared to all of the characters, and it was nice to see Niel and Eva developed even further. There are also tons of refrences to To The Moon if you pay attenton, and even a well crafted nod to A Bird Story( note that our patient here is the boy in A Bird Story as an adult).

But to do so would be a disrespect to the devs and the game itself. So I'll skip the plot and jump straight into the gameplay and technical stuff, because this is where the devs really stepped up.\n\nThe style and theme were practically the same, but for it to have taken 6 years+ to develop you can bet there's improvement. Everything just seems more meticulous somehow. I thought TTM was a bit on the crude side, but every scene in FP just looks so polished and perfectly hued and [i]right[/]. Characters have waaay more sprites, too, which really helps making characters even more real and relatable. But the best part is, no more random plants blocking the way! \n\nThere's more ...interactivity to the world than in TTM. And, [spoiler] you can actually fight as Neil this time! [/spoiler] There's more game elements, and there're more choices to make, even though they aren't plot-important. \n\nSome minuses, still. The game crashed on me 2 times! Something about bitmap not generated, and I highly suspect it's the special sprites in some scenes. I was playing on something less than a potato, though, so this will probably not happen to you. And maybe for the same reason, the text and scenes were a bit slow and glitchy everytime there's a special effect like leaves falling, lighting, etc. Sometimes the map is not effectively designed against backtracking, [spoiler] even Neil said it at one point, [/spoiler] so it might take away the immersion. Some mechanics are only introduced once and never appeared again, but hopefully they will be in use more in the later episodes, because [spoiler] switching between Neil and Eva is so cool and has so much potential [/spoiler]. \n\nOverall, it's a good game, lads. 5/7, would buy at launch again.", "timestamp_created": 1513322342, "timestamp_updated": 1513322342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38318320": {"recommendationid": "38318320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069438710", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513325092}, "language": "english", "review": "> Launch Game\n> See menu\n> Hear menu soundtrack\n> Be reminded of To The Moon\n> Sob uncontrollably", "timestamp_created": 1513321840, "timestamp_updated": 1513321840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38318257": {"recommendationid": "38318257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095085854", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513326594}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u3010\u8fdb\u5ea6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ae0\u3011\nFaye\u771f\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u5417\uff1f\n------------------------\n\u3010\u8fdb\u5ea6\uff1a\u6700\u7ec8\u7ae0\u3011\nFaye\u771f\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff01\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u6709\u4eba\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u5173\u9057\u61be\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\n\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u5173\u5979\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ea\u5c5e\u4e8eColin\u7684\u5979\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\n\u6211\u4e5f\u6709\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5979\u3002\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5728\u6709\u4e86\u5973\u53cb\u4ee5\u540e\uff0c\u5979\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u518d\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\n\u6216\u8005\u8bf4\uff0c\u662f\u6211\u4e0d\u518d\u9700\u8981\u5979\u4e86\u3002\n\u4f46\u662f\u6211\u5e0c\u671b\uff0c\u6211\u4e5f\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u5979\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u6211\u8eab\u8fb9\uff0c\u966a\u4f34\u7740\u6211\uff0c\u6ce8\u89c6\u7740\u6211\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u751f\u547d\u7ec8\u7ed3\u7684\u90a3\u4e00\u5929\u3002\n\u5e0c\u671b\u90a3\u4e00\u5929\uff0c\u6211\u4e5f\u80fd\u5411Colin\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u4e0e\u6211\u7684\u5979\uff0c\u5206\u4eab\u6211\u7684\u4eba\u751f\uff1b\n\u5206\u4eab\u90a3\u4e2a\uff0c\u867d\u6709\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540e\u6094\u7684\u4eba\u751f\u3002\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\u8c22\u8c22\u4f60\n\u6709\u4f60\u966a\u4f34\u7684\u8fd9\u5341\u4f59\u5e74\n\u5e76\u4e0d\u5b64\u5355\n\n\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\n\u6211\u5e0c\u671b\u4f60\u80fd\u5728\u6211\u8eab\u8fb9\n\u6ce8\u89c6\u7740\u6211\n\n\u5373\u4f7f\u4e0d\u518d\u51fa\u73b0\n\u5373\u4f7f\u65e0\u9700\u518d\u89c1\n\n\u9053\u522b\u7684\u8bdd\u8bed\n\u6211\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8bf4\n\u4e5f\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8bf4\n\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u77e5\u9053\n\n\u4f60\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u6211\u8eab\u8fb9", "timestamp_created": 1513321556, "timestamp_updated": 1513330636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38318218": {"recommendationid": "38318218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027749773", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513323448}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful, hilarious, powerful and uplifiting.

I enjoyed Eva and Neil well enough.  I could not build an emotional connection with Colin.  He really felt bland as a character.  he really didn't have any trauma or real struggles to deal with.  I feel as though the story had to get a little crazy to counter this, but as a result, Colin really was lost in the mix.  By the end of it, I forgot the story was even about him in the first place.  When you have a story driven game like this, you need more interesting and flawed characters (like River and Johnny).  The story and new characters fell flat for me, which is a major shortcoming in a story based game.\n\n\nIt's also a pet peeve of mine to have so many unanswered questions.  I understand you need some,  but none of the overall mysteries were answered at all.  Then on top of that, a ton of new mysteries were piled on.  I feel this game suffers from middle book syndrome, where it really just exists to set up stuff for the next entry.

Of course, that could be the entire year it has been since I finished To the Moon and shed an unashamed amount of tears over, but still Finding Paradise seems to exude nostalgia. The narrative in this episode is one of coming to age and lonliness, learning to accept that as we grow older, we have to let things go. Yet when we let things go, sometimes, we are rewarded with something tuly great. Finding Paradise is a story of learning to live with regrets and accepting that they are a part of life, no matter the circumstances. \nIn the end, Finding Paradise is not To the Moon.

In retrospect, while I was not thrilled with A Bird Story, I would have to rate the franchise: TTM > Minisodes > A Bird Story > Finding Paradise.\n\nI didn't connect with Finding Paradise's main character or overall plotline at all. When the game ended, I was left saying \"wait, that's it?\" The vast majority of the game carried zero emotional impact for me, with the exception of a very brief scene near the end. It didn't offer any meaningful progression of Neil and Eva's storylines from the end of TTM and especially the stunning ending of the 2nd holiday minisode; it made a couple of references to that plot, and perpetuated the mystery just the tiniest bit, without offering the player any meaningful movement forward along that thread.\n\nI think this game suffers greatly for being a sequel to To The Moon. If Finding Paradise had come out first followed by TTM, I might have been more positive about it. TTM was such a masterpiece, not just because of the plot and emotional impact, but also with its multiple breathtaking standout musical pieces that I regularly listen to years after it came out. Finding Paradise has decently good music, but nothing remotely approaching the magnificence of For River, Moonwisher, Once Upon a Memory, or Everything's Alright.\n\nThe gameplay is also a huge step backwards. I usually don't like gameplay-light experiences like TTM, but as I said, TTM is my favourite game. Finding Paradise, in terms of gameplay, is frustrating and tedious by comparison--the \"memento preparation\" puzzles are very poorly explained to the player and are tedious and trial-and-error based to solve, vs. the simple, clear requirements of TTM's puzzles; though, honestly, I think either game works far better without these little puzzles. The experience of finding memory links is generally comparable to TTM, as is the general gameplay, but there are a couple of \"combat sequences\" vaguely reminiscent of the \"Zombievas\" sequence from TTM which are far more frustrating to play. I repeatedly wished the game was over, and at one point, came close to just quitting it and watching a youtube playthrough instead.\n\nI know I'm in the minority based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this game, but as a diehard TTM fan, I was really let down here. If I had to sum up the experience compared to TTM, I'd emphasize that the plot was hollow, with characters I couldn't bring myself to care about, no satisfying resolution, mediocre music, and virtually zero emotional impact; and that the gameplay was, at many points, frustrating and tedious, making me wish the game was over.", "timestamp_created": 1513310270, "timestamp_updated": 1513310285, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434588", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38315690": {"recommendationid": "38315690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073819036", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513309546}, "language": "english", "review": "Prepare your tissues; you're in for a treat.\nIt exceeded all my expectations, being an emotional journey from start to finish, as well as being funnier than To the Moon.

The memory link puzzle is different this time around, getting more difficult as you progress.\n\nThe person whose memories you explore is the same character from A Bird Story. You don't need to play that to enjoy this game, but for those who have will find Finding Paradise more heart clutching, as the character we got to know several years ago is now doomed to die.\n\nLong story short, if you have the money, I recommend playing this game.

The music is brilliant, the visuals are superb and the story is well-crafted as well. I wouldn't say it's tear-jerking like To The Moon, but there are certainly a fair few emotional moments. The lighthearted humour and general cheesiness is certainly a defining feature of these games, and I found it good for the most part, but I personally found it became a bit too overbearing at times with some of the action-y sequences. \n\nHowever, my main gripes with this game come from RPG Maker. Man oh man I wish something better was used. There doesn't seem to be any accounting for screen resolution, with the game instead stretching when in fullscreen and it really doesn't look good. Furthermore, only a small square in the centre of the screen is utilised leaving a significant amount of unused screen real estate. There is also intermittent stuttering when moving around, which is really distracting. The smoothing option enabled by default in the F1 screen seems to eliminate most of it, but it doesn't seem to go far enough. Even worse, the F1 menu doesn't seem to be usable with the mouse when in fullscreen mode, so good luck using your keyboard to navigate it.\n\nThough I hope the issues above can be addressed, I fully expect they're limitations of the engine.

Ken Gao, the writer/director of this series, is a true creative genius for coming up with such beautiful, heartfelt stories that are also immensely entertaining due to witty dialogue and haphazard pop culture references. Now that I've devoured this one, I will wait just as hungrily for the next installment in this beautiful narrative experience!\n\nIf you are eager for some truly heartachy feels and a beautiful story with some hilarious characters, give this a shot! You really don't need to play To the Moon to enjoy it, though I would recommend playing that game to get a deeper experience with this one. And both of these games are about 6 hours long, so you could complete both in a day if you really wanted to.\n\nPS: I'd like to thank FreeBird Games for creating wonderful masterpieces that fill me with such delicious feels!

Der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Kritikpunkt also gleich Vorneweg: Das Spiel ist VIEL zu kurz. *heul* -.-\n\nDer Humor ist etwas Alberner geraten als in den Vorg\u00e4ngern, was ich Pers\u00f6nlich aber nicht zwingen Negativ finde. Die Steuerrung hat einen Riesensprung nach vorne gemacht, auch wenn sie in den Action-Szenen immer noch reichlich Hackelig ist... Immerhin kann man in den besagten Szenen jetzt gezielt und \u00fcberlegt Agieren anstatt einfach nur im  Panikmode auf den Tasten zu Trommeln. Der zwischenzeitig eingestreute \"Paper-Plane-Sidescroll-Shooter\" macht sogar richtig Laune. Und zudem sind derartige Einlagen selten und dienen der Auflockerung in dieser ansonsten eher Dialoglastigen Interactive Fiction.\n\nGrafisch ist Finding Paradise genau das, was man erwartet; Extrem h\u00fcbsche Pixelgrafik, aber trotzdem noch Pixelgrafik. Gut wenn manns mag, nicht so toll wenn mans nicht mag. Ich geb 10/10, denn Ich mag h\u00fcbsche Pixelgrafik.\n\nDer Soundtrack und die Storry sind DIE Argumente zum Kauf.

But the true beauty of this game lies in it's music, it's themes, and it's cohesion.\n\nThe themes that are focused on in this game are distinct from the themes that are focused in To the Moon. Through the impressive score and expansive narration, Finding Paradise aims to intensify these themes to help remind us why they are significant to a person, as well as to create emotion and sympathy. This overall aim was executed beautifully, but then again, I am only basing off my opinion throught the fact that I played all of the other Freebird games. Speaking of which, for those who did play the other Freebird games, you'll find that Episode 2 is very unique from the other titles, but very much the same in that same regard.\n\nWhether you have or

I love discussing the many different objects, the music, the story, the characters, etc. with everyone who plays games. (I have a 100% success rate in referal turnover to fans for that game XD) I also enjoyed A Bird Story for what it's worth.\n\nNow, this is a Finding Paradise review so I'd best stop talking about other games and talk about this one!\n\nFinding Paradise is another journey full of suspense and emotion like its predecessor To The Moon. There was much crafty humor implemented in this game that had me laughing frequently. There are suspenseful moments in the story where I was unsure of what outcomes were going to be. There were also a few moments that were presented well to draw sadness out of the player.\n\nKan Gao continues his witty humor in Finding Paradise. I think this game had the most humor out of the three I have mentioned thus far and it isn't just reusing jokes that everyone has heard. Finding Paradise's humor is unique in that you don't see it coming, but anticipate the next bit of humor that is assuredly going to occur at some point. The use of mechanics and names from other games and movies as jokes is also a nice touch (Loved the mafia Kan, lol).\n\nFinding Paradise improves most on the previous games in aspects of gameplay. Gameplay isn't the most important thing in a story-driven game and I get that, but Finding Paradise added new game mechanics at regular intervals to keep it interesting (I just was sad that my shoe attack did NOTHING, lol).\n\nAt this moment if I were to rate the three games I have mentioned I would give Finding Paradise a 9/10. It really is a different type of game than To The Moon in my opinion. I think that each will appeal more to seperate groups though both will be enjoyed alot. My ratings of the Freebird games:\n\nFinding Paradise- 9/10\nTo The Moon- 10/10\nA Bird Story- 8/10\n\nI highly recommend everyone to play all three and though it is said that Finding Paradise is a standalone game (It is), you will miss out on ALOT of references if you do not complete the other two games first. Do yourself a favor and pickup all three of these amazing games.\n\n\n(Amazing work once again Kan Gao. This was my most anticipated game this year and I am glad to have got to play it. Tell the team to keep making great games like this, the gaming industry needs these kind of games that focus on story.

You dive into a dying person's memories, gather mementos and solve minor puzzles to descend even deeper into their past until you can fulfill their dying wish. There are a few new elements (which I don't want to spoil here), but they don't make much of a difference. And one of these didn't work so well due to being constricted by the limits of the rpg-maker engine.\n\nSo if you didn't like To The Moon, you won't like this game either. But everything feels a lot more polished, the soundtrack is amazing, and the story diverges more than enough to stand on its own.

rollercoaster that will capture your heart with charm. \nHowever I found the first half of the game was slightly more dull than TTM (To The moon abbreviated so we don't have to write this out even though I just made it even worse), but in the second half it quickly picks up the pace and more than makes up for this.\n\n\"Do you have any regrets left?\"\nA lot of backstory questions were left unanswered from TTM, which I won't spoil, just know that, well, if you're looking for answers, as far as I know, you don't get many, you only get more, even deeper, questions. I love it though, and I desperately crave a part 3.\n\n\"So this is your [i]solution[/i] huh?\"\nAll in all, this game is exactly as advertised, it's just like TTM, both got me tearing up, I like the way the story builds up early on more in TTM more but the plottwists and climaxes in Finding Paradise hit harder for me personally. Finding one or two of the memory links was kind of tedious and the lategame puzzles could be semi-challenging, which sometimes slightly broke the atmosphere, but all in all, this game is phenomenal\n\nNeil was right, it is always about a girl in the patients childhood. This one, however, is slightly different.\nYou'll find out, in your own way.\n\nGlaze: IM AT THE SAD ENDING OKAY\nGlaze: EVERYONE IS GONE AND PPL ARE DOING DEPRESSION\nGlaze: SVERY SAD\nGlaze: 10/10 recommend\nGlaze: if u wan cry play dis game\nFlappy: copy dis to a review of the game\nGlaze: i might\nFlappy: lol\nFlappy: well\nFlappy: i guess u didnt find paradise after all\nGlaze: only depression\nGlaze: game should be called finding suicidal midnight thoughts\nFlappy: or finding something to do while im playing video games and get depressed and want to kill myself\nGlaze: finding a reason to live\nGlaze: spoilers: wont find it here no sir\nFlappy: finding a reason to die*\nFlappy: that's better\nGlaze: oh loads of those\nFlappy: yeet", "timestamp_created": 1516215646, "timestamp_updated": 1516217069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39418886": {"recommendationid": "39418886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053146261", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 471, "last_played": 1516211810}, "language": "english", "review": "At the end I just broke into tears... perfectly directed... such precious art.

Paradise.\n\nBut I was wrong, totally wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s got to be a lot of pressure for its devs, since they had achieved tremendous success on To The Moon, however Finding Paradise upholds all the good points about To The Moon, they managed to bring ppl another masterpiece with stunning sound tracks and a deep story, for anyone who has played To The Moon before, this game will never let you down.\n\nBesides all those things as amazing as To The Moon\u2019s, they added more playability to the game, there are more details and funny dialogues, there are more stuff you could interact with, and there are actually boss fights at the end of the game. \n\nHats off to Kan Gao, and whomever involved in the development of To The Moon series, thanks for bringing me such a memorable

It is a narrative game through and through, and it fills in those otherwise blank spaces with beautifully simple yet elegant artwork.

Playing this game was also just as wonderful an experience.\n\nWhile the story kept up the same basic idea of what Sigmund Corp sets out to do, the episode really highlights how unique each situation is and that's what keeps the game play fresh. I was guessing all throughout the episode what was actually going on. The way this game built up to certain reveals did not disappoint--there is an eerie air of mystery around the events which then dissipates once the player gets to the reveal. It makes for good tension and some of the revelations made make the story both more interesting and, in some cases, kind of heart breaking.\n\nIn To the Moon, I was enamored with the music which is what got me to play it in the the first place. The music for this game lives up to that standard as well, if not exceeding my expectations. I like that the music kept a particular theme like it had in To the Moon. It sets apart the fact that these two episodes are completely different from one another and serves as the colour pallette of sound. It's a really sweet soundtrack.\n\n Also, I was definitely there for Laura Shigihara and her song for this episode. If her song for To the Moon made you bawl, the song for this episode will make you bawl. Harder. In all seriousness, though, it was a song that packed an emotional punch. The lyrics are well written, the music was a perfect fit, and, on a personal level for me, it hit a really vulnerable spot. It got me to consider a few things in my own life particularly after a very rough semester at university. When a song gets someone to do that, you have done something completely right.\n\nI recommend this game and I am looking forward to the possibility of another game coming out.", "timestamp_created": 1515892740, "timestamp_updated": 1515892740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39325247": {"recommendationid": "39325247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198341354909", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 318, "last_played": 1515892009}, "language": "english", "review": "Great story, breathtaking soundtrack, finished the game half an hour ago and I'm still bawling my eyes out.", "timestamp_created": 1515892620, "timestamp_updated": 1515892620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39323847": {"recommendationid": "39323847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051301053", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 469, "last_played": 1515886448}, "language": "english", "review": "wow. i don't even know where to begin, honestly. the first game, \"to the moon\" gave me enough emotions as it was. but this one? it upped everything. it really did. not only were the animations a bit more lively, the humor even wittier (the first 10 seconds, alone, [i]cracked me the heck up[/i] and if you've played the first game you'll know why), but wow oh wow was the story just... hopeful. meaningful. i'm, unfortunately, not much of a crier--i don't respond with tears when faced with a touching story, as much as i might want to--but i did get that kinda... i dunno, sickly feeling in the back of my throat. the tightness, i guess. it's these kinds of stories and moments that make me WISH i was someone who cried at games/movies.\n\nthere were so many times throughout this game that i refused to progress. not because i was bored or not having fun, but because the moment--the memory--was just so peaceful and touching and heartwarming. i just... didn't want to leave. i think i spent a good 10 to 15 minutes just standing in the autumn/pond memory, watching the leaves fall, listening to the wind and the gentle piano music. \n\ni also adore the resolution of this story. i know the feeling of loneliness intimately, and there was also something really... special, i guess? about [spoiler]seeing someone make their own company, their own worlds, like i'm sure a lot of creators do with their characters and stories. i know i have. maybe not at the same level as colin did, but. i've revisited characters i made back in my middle school days, whose adventures were something to look forward to after a difficult day. it's a good feeling.[/spoiler] overall, the experience was just brimming with hope and good vibes and earnest love. i'm so, so happy i played this game. and heck. freebird, you tease. please continue bringing the Good Content\u2122. i can't thank you enough for all these emotions and the fountain of inspiration you've given us. rock on, my dudes.", "timestamp_created": 1515887491, "timestamp_updated": 1515887491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39316890": {"recommendationid": "39316890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142760884", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 113, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 307, "last_played": 1515190709}, "language": "english", "review": "Good sequel to To the Moon!

fiction, I couldn't put down Finding Paradise. I sat down to start it at some normal hour of the night; and here I am at 4:15am having been unable to remove myself from the story that is equal parts profound, funny, sad, scary, romantic, and life affirming all in one. \n\nStory is what you're playing Finding Paradise for, so I won't ruin any of it; but I will say it's hard not to walk away from this and think about your own life. There are far worse ways to spend a few dollars and a few hours of your life; I highly recommend Finding Paradise. \n\nAnd like \"To the Moon\", be prepared to bawl. It'll do your soul good.", "timestamp_created": 1515845899, "timestamp_updated": 1515846253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527541", "comment_count": 0,

You can feel the passion put into it by the artists and writers. As expected, the soundtrack is beautiful and I'm even listening to it right now as I'm writing this. They have gone out-of-the-park with it compared to their previous games in almost every step of the way. I laughed and even cried. (Which is very surprising because it was incredibly awkward for me when I watched The Fault in our Stars and could not cry whatsoever.) I highly recommend this game as it went way above my expectations and I hope it blows you away too because I wish I can experience this work-of-art anew yet I know I can't. \nRecognizing an important factor though, it was short. It wasn't as short as A Bird Story but it did not take long as you can see my hours. That doesn't mean you shouldn't buy this.

I can\u2019t say too much here in regards to spoilers but the game does a great job picking up where its predecessor left off and delivers another emotionally touching story. In my opinion, this story wasn\u2019t quite as moving as To the Moon and this game did have its dragging moments from time to time. Makes sense considering To the Moon was about 3-4 hours and this one is 6-7.\n\nThe music and pixel art was still gorgeous and the game did present some interesting mysteries I found myself wanting to solve, but again, not nearly as much as I did in To the Moon. I wouldn\u2019t say this game disappointed me because it really was a solid game with a lot of love put into it, but I just didn\u2019t care as much for these characters and this story. Hopefully 3 gets it back to the same level as 1.\n\nI\u2019ll give it a solid 8/10, whereas I gave To the Moon a 10/10.\n\nSide Note: Kan Gao, if you see this, I beg you to message me.  I have a story in my head of where I'm hoping you take Episode 3.  If not, maybe you'll like my idea to run with it.

It deserves the praise it gets as does the rest of the series. The music can be cheerful, suspenceful, relaxing and sad. The artwork is really detailed for being pixelated. The humour is 'on point' :)  just as it was in To the Moon and EVERY character all has their own charm to them. Especially our favourite dorky tech guy and his cucumber obsessed partner. The plot was well thought out and the intereactions between the characters really pulled at my heart strings. (These games never fail to make me cry. In a good way though.) \n\nAnother superb job. I understand if it takes long to make the follow up to this but I'll be eagerly waiting in anticipation to find out about...'things'.

(Eva and Neil returns!)\n [*] Truly beautiful and emotional soundtrack to set the mood\n[/list]\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n [*] The wait for the next game\n [*] Some very minor things\n\n[h1]Overall Score:[/h1] [b]10/10[/b] - Get it right now and PLAY IT!\n__________________________________________________________\n\n\nI was really excited when they announce this game - another chapter in the story about changing lives. I've played the first game \"To The Moon\" some years back and was reduced to tears by the end of it, and I still remember how I felt back then. So I have extremely high hopes for this game. \n\nAnd guess what? IT DELIVERS.\n\n[b]The Gameplay?[/b] If you've ever played the first game \"To The Moon\", you will know for a fact that gameplay doesn't really matter here at all. It feels like your regular RPGMaker game, where you walk around investigating and talking to people. The puzzles, while they make you think at times, are really easy to do and does not present much of a challenge at all. But once again, this element is not what matters here - what does is the next element we'll be talking about.\n\n[b]The Story?[/b] I must say, Kan really outdone himself this time. The way he presented this game's story is simply outstanding. While Johnny's story is one that is traversed in a linear manner, Colin's life is told in a different manner: [spoiler]it skips between his older and younger self, creating a spiral towards a single point in his timeline.[/spoiler] It's such a weird way to tell a life story, but I think there can be no other effective way to tell it than that. The pacing is good - it never rushes you through the plot and gives you some nuanced moments that makes you appreciate the characters (i.e. Eva and Neil's usual shenanigans). And by the end of your playthrough, you'll be left wanting for more. (You'll know what I mean once you do ;) )\n\n[b]The Characters?[/b] Truly memorable! I was SO GLAD when I found out that Dr. Rosalene and Watts, just the very best duo I've ever seen in a video game, makes a return to do what they do best - correcting people's memories and spout witty side remarks while they're at it! And then there's the main star of this story - Colin Reeds, and the two most important women in his life - Sofia and Faye. Like the first game, these characters have so much life put into them through their dialogues and interactions, making you, the player, relate to them at times. The way they interact felt.. real, as though you're not simply watching something fictional... it feels like it can happen in the real world. And I think that's what really makes the story of Finding Paradise so much powerful.\n\n[b]The Music?[/b] Ohh man, the music... Not even a single piece in this track felt out of place. Appropriate tracks will play in the most appropriate moments - funny and cheery tracks for some goofy moments, solemn Piano and Cello in the more intimate and melancholic moments, and tense tracks for when sht really hits the fan. Most of it will have the capacity to just squeeze a tear out of you, in conjuction with the story that unfolds in front of you. And like the last one, The vocal track \"Wish My Life Away\" sung by the very talented Laura Shigihara, just really\n\n[b]Conclusion?[/b] \"Finding Paradise\" is mostly a story-driven game, and one that does it excellently. Everything falls into place here - the music, the story, the characters, the setting... Every element just complements one another, making one superb game. I really tried looking for major faults here, but apart from a few misspelled words and such, there's not much to work with on that front. Kan, you've done another outstanding game. Looking forward to your next one!\n\nOverall, I give this game a solid [b]10/10 - PLAY THIS GAME BEFORE YOU DIE![/b] Oh, but before that, you should play \"To The Moon\" first before doing this one,

sequel \"Finding Paradise\" simply fell short when it comes to bringing the same roller-coaster ride as the spiritual successor. And here I want to give out a full explanation of why \"Finding Paradise\" being nowhere as good as \"Too The Moon\". I by no means is a professional story-writer/ reviewer, so just consider all these rattling if you find it irritating.\n\n[h1]SPOILER OF BOTH \"TO THE MOON\" AND \"FINDING PARADISE\"[/h1]\n\n[h1]Lackluster Conflicts[/h1]\nSubjective is saying a game emotionally impactful or not, I would like to point out one of the greatest strength \"To The Moon\" has, which \"Finding Paradise\" failed to achieve. For most mediocre and repetitive plots, conflicts, which drive the excitement of stories, are typically created between two sides with obviously distinct attitudes (usually the protagonist and the villain). \"To The Moon\" however, without the need of bad guys, managed to bring in conflicts seamlessly with default story setting readers simply unaware of: We all find the story background \"The Sigmund Corp made a contract with Johnny to fulfill his wish of going to the moon\" innocent enough for us not to care. But as time proceeded, readers eventually discovered the true wish of Johnny, and realized that Dr Watts and Rosalene are stuck in a dilemma where they are required to erase Johnny's truly cherished memories and replaced those with fake ones, all simply because of the mandatory protocol we overlooked. And with these surprising moments it really caught the majority off guard, leading to the uncontrollablly sad feelings when readers have to accept the bittersweet outcome, such that no matter how perfect the re-constructed memories (ending) done by the Sigmund couple, the truly precious memories have been long gone. It is hard not to sob when you think about that. However, in \"Finding Paradise\", what we got are just simple wrestling between Neil/Eva and Faye, with Faye trying to force the main characters to leave since they interfere Colin's imaginary world, the ideal world that fades when Colin grows up, and the regret Colin got when he lost that world. Neil/Eva later came up with a literally perfect solution for this (And To be honest,the solution had lots of questionable parts, including Faye being compatible to control the machine). As you can see, \"Finding Paradise\" lacked the depth of \"To The Moon\" has, with its straight forward conflicts/ending, and the absence of plot-twist setup.\n\n[h1]Sofia Not Doing Her Job[/h1]\nWhile Faye took most of the attentions in the story, I was disappointed to find out Sofia failing to play a bigger role as much as Faye does. With the story nature being told in a leaping way till middle, you would expect the amount of time spent on telling the stories between Faye/Colin to be as long as that of Sofia/Colin (which it did). However, when I tried to summarize the whole story, I still can't figure out the important position of Sofia to the whole story. All she did was meeting with Colin, expressed her concern about memory-altering, as well as having a wonderful marriage with Colin. Perhaps she is the fuse that make Colin's imaginary friend loose? But still she barely has any dramatic moment to tell, when compared to Faye and even River, despite a significant amount of time being focused on her. This reminds me that, during my early gameplay hours in \"To The Moon\", I felt confused, frustrated and bored about the awkward presence of River to have little to no relationship with Johnny's wish, not until everything is revealed and all the puzzles beautifully connected together and amazes me (Including the platypus, the bag, the rabbit origami and more importantly the dual paper-folded rabbit). Except this time, those negative sentiments still carries on after the ending of \"Finding Paradise\",  mainly because of Sofia still not having a satisfactory role she deserves in the story.\n\n[h1]MiniGames Not So Suitable[/h1]\nIt is worth complimenting that this sequel seeks better mini-games, coding and graphics. But still I thought the mini-Games pretty much ruined the seriousness in the later part of the story. Yes, I am aware that \"To The Moon\" has the \"zombie\" mini-game near the end too. However, it does serve a purpose and a clear message -- Eva is trying her hardest to hinder Neil from her memory-altering. Even that game is easy, we can definitely tell how hard Eva is trying after getting knocked back by a few traps she placed. In contrast, I really find the mini-games in \"Finding Paradise\" to be redundant. Three Mini-Games in a row somehow, for Neil to fight against Faye. But then later on, here comes Eva to save the day. So, what really is the purpose of these games, if the result doesn't truly matter anyways? If that doesn't sound very convincing, imagine extracting the \"zombie\" game from \"To The Moon\", you will immediately notice the difference that the game suddenly has less emphasis on the contradiction of opinions between Neil and Eva. What about doing the same thing for \"Finding Paradise\"? You can think that by yourself.\n\n\nYea, I hope that this review is not too harsh.

There is more \"game\" in Finding Paradise and everything feels built better. The music is top notch, the pixel art is more expressive than a modern 3D AAA title, and everything feels more cohesive. The dialog is very similar as To The Moon with jumps from serious to comical. If you didn't like To the Moon for it's dialog you likely wont like it in Finding Paradise. This game also expands on Eva and Neil's stories which I enjoyed quite a bit.\n\nFinding Paradise doesn't have the same charm that To the Moon did, but I don't feel like that is a detriment.

The characters are interesting and you start to piece things together as you go through the game, but at the same time, never knowing what's going to happen next. The humour in it is great too, with lots of pop culture references that lighten the tone throughout.

Wybitne To the Moon, bardzo dobre A bird story i genialna polityka wzgl\u0119dem graczy sprawi\u0142y, \u017ce czekanie na Finding Paradise by\u0142o niezwykle d\u0142ugim rokiem. Ale by\u0142o warto.\n\nMimo i\u017c Kana Gao uwa\u017cam za osob\u0119 robi\u0105c\u0105 niebywa\u0142\u0105 robot\u0119, w kt\u00f3rej na kilometr wida\u0107 w\u0142o\u017cone serce, to nie mog\u0119 powiedzie\u0107, \u017ce nie mia\u0142em obaw. Ale wynika\u0142o to raczej z mojej natury sceptyka. No bo co je\u015bli historia nie b\u0119dzie dobra? Przecie\u017c bez tego gra nie b\u0119dzie mia\u0142a si\u0119 czym broni\u0107. No, w sumie to jeszcze muzyka, ale do muzyki jeszcze przejd\u0119 bo to jest tak wysoki poziom geniuszu, \u017ce rozgadam si\u0119 o tym za chwil\u0119.\n\nAle jak si\u0119 pewnie domy\u015blacie obawy by\u0142y niepotrzebne, bo historia w Finding Paradise jest znowu wybitna. A szczerze m\u00f3wi\u0105c do ostatnich 30 minut powiedzia\u0142bym \u017ce jest tylko bardzo dobra. Ponownie podr\u00f3\u017c po wspomnieniach umieraj\u0105cego, tym razem Colina to prawdziwy rollercoaster emocjonalny, kt\u00f3ry swoj\u0105 fabu\u0142\u0105 bije na g\u0142ow\u0119 zdecydowan\u0105 wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 hollywoodzkich produkcji.\n\nCho\u0107 fabu\u0142a nie wymaga znajomo\u015bci To the Moon oraz a Bird Story, to jednak zdecydowanie polecam najpierw zapozna\u0107 si\u0119 z tymi tytu\u0142ami. Zyskacie dzi\u0119ki temu du\u017c\u0105 ilo\u015b\u0107 smaczk\u00f3w i nie tylko, ale o tym nie b\u0119d\u0119 m\u00f3wi\u0107, bo to ju\u017c terytorium spoilerowe.\n\nDialogi w Finding Paradise stoj\u0105 na bardzo wysokim poziomie, du\u017co lepszym ni\u017c w To the Moon. Colin przypad\u0142 mi w sumie do gustu tak samo bardzo jak Johny, to w Finding Paradise nasza para doktor\u00f3w jest na niebotycznie wy\u017cszym poziomie. Oczywi\u015bcie, lubi\u0142em ich ju\u017c w To the Moon, ale teraz s\u0105 po prostu genialni. Ich dialogi s\u0105 przezabawne i razem tworz\u0105 niezwyk\u0142y duet, kt\u00f3rego nie da si\u0119 nie lubi\u0107.\n\nI w ko\u0144cu muzyka. Jak pewnie wiecie, do soundtracku przyk\u0142adam ogromn\u0105 wag\u0119 niemal w ka\u017cdej grze. A je\u015bli gra jest od Freebird games, to mam wr\u0119cz gwarancj\u0119 majstersztyku. Kan Gao to niezwyk\u0142a posta\u0107. Nie do\u015b\u0107, \u017ce tworzy kapitalne gry, to jest dla mnie absolutnym Bogiem w kwestii muzyki. B\u0105d\u017amy szczerzy, ka\u017cdy kto pokocha\u0142 To the Moon, po sko\u0144czeniu gry puszcza\u0142 sobie For river, czy finaln\u0105 piosenk\u0119 i gorzko pop\u0142akiwa\u0142.\n\nI w sumie to na pocz\u0105tku gry by\u0142em lekko zaniepokojony, bo w tle s\u0142ysza\u0142em jedynie utwory z To the Moon w nowej wersji. I wtedy jak grom spad\u0142 ten majstersztyk. Utw\u00f3r, kt\u00f3ry sprawi\u0142 \u017ce poczu\u0142em si\u0119 znowu jak w To the Moon. Bo by\u0142y momenty, \u017ce po prostu nie by\u0142em si\u0119 w stanie ruszy\u0107, a z reszt\u0105 pos\u0142uchajcie najlepszej melodii z Finding Paradise, czyli Time is a Place. Po prostu nie mam s\u0142\u00f3w.\n\nNie mog\u0119 uwierzy\u0107, \u017ce mo\u017cna zrobi\u0107 co\u015b tak koj\u0105cego dusz\u0119. A historia stoj\u0105ca za tym sprawia, \u017ce melodia jest jeszcze lepsza.\n\nFinding Paradise jest te\u017c du\u017co \u015bmieszniejsze, g\u0142\u00f3wnie za spraw\u0105 odpa\u0142\u00f3w Neila, jednego z doktor\u00f3w.\n \nAle no niestety, Finding Paradise ma kilka rzeczy, kt\u00f3re po prostu irytuj\u0105. Przede wszystkim toporne poruszanie si\u0119. Ja rozumiem, \u017ce tak sobie Kan wymy\u015bli\u0142, no ale to nie jest po prostu przyjemne, kiedy musi si\u0119 chodzi\u0107 po liniach prostych. Chodzenie na skos przywita\u0142bym z otwartymi ramionami.\n\nDodatkowo gra nie ma funkcji robienia zrzut\u00f3w ekranu na Steamie i tak jak To the Moon i A Bird Story nie posiada \u017cadnych ustawie\u0144. Nie mo\u017cemy zmieni\u0107 rozdzielczo\u015bci, czy nawet g\u0142o\u015bno\u015bci. Troch\u0119 s\u0142abo.\n\nNo i jest jeszcze minigierka, kt\u00f3r\u0105 trzeba wykona\u0107 przy ka\u017cdej podr\u00f3\u017cy do nast\u0119pnego wspomnienia. Jest inna ni\u017c w To the Moon i c\u00f3\u017c, w sumie by\u0142a ca\u0142kiem ciekawie pomy\u015blana i sk\u0142aniaj\u0105ca do lekkiego my\u015blenia, ale niekt\u00f3rych mo\u017ce to wybija\u0107 za bardzo z historii i zwyczajnie irytowa\u0107.\n\nAle b\u0105d\u017amy szczerzy, to s\u0105 pierdo\u0142y w kontek\u015bcie ca\u0142o\u015bci, kt\u00f3ra jest po prostu genialna.\n\nPowoli podsumowuj\u0105c Kan Gao znowu to zrobi\u0142. Doprowadzi\u0142 mnie do \u015bmiechu, a potem \u0142ez i tak na zmian\u0119. Bo Finding Paradise to historia wzruszaj\u0105ca, zabawna, niezwykle urocza i po prostu pi\u0119kna. Znowu po sko\u0144czeniu pierwsz\u0105 fraz\u0105 jak\u0105 wpisa\u0142em na Youtubie by\u0142 Soundtrack produkcji od Freebird Games.", "timestamp_created": 1515523153, "timestamp_updated":

This is true. Very true. It's also not at all the reason I keep coming back to these crummy RPG-Maker-Esque cornfests. \n\nThese games aren't perfect. Far from it. These aren't even \"games\", in the truest sense, nor do they have the visual appeal of your typical walking simulator; the only thing here is the story, and on a surface level, even that's a bit questionable.\n\nThe dialogue can be ham-fisted, meme-ey, the serious tone set by the setting and subject matter undercut in an instant by the third instance of a character going \"What the cucumber?!?\" in as many minutes.\n\nThey're filled with the aforementioned psuedo-16 bit graphics, a stunning amount of them recycled from 'To the Moon' and 'A Bird Story'. There's even a section where you enter the subject's memory of their childhood highschool, and it's just the same environment you traversed in Johnny's tale 5ish years ago copy-pasted with a witty remark about how familiar it is.\n\nThe \"game/minigame\" sections, as in 'To the Moon', are awkward, shoehorned-in abnormalities, tonally dissonant with everything else and questionable to control, adding nothing but a little bit of unnecessary interactivity and the occasional low-effort Kefka reference. I will say they\u2019re a bit improved, like the small puzzles in-between traversal sections no longer recording your overall failure rate for no reason and with no means to reset, but they (and the other minigames especially) still aren\u2019t that well-integrated. \n\nBut I'll be damned if I don't keep coming back to Freebird's games, because despite every instance of an extremely game-y zoom-in to a pixilated sprite as it undergoes an overdone Saint Seiya transformation sequence for little narrative purpose, there's somehow always the constant underlying perfection with how these games, hoisted on the shoulders of Kan Gao's overall storytelling, manage to capture the human condition in a reverent and multi-faceted way. They make you ask questions, about yourself and about the world built within these games - but those questions aren't borne of plotholes, or of inconsistent characterization, instead stemming from the underlying moral implications of the Inception-meets-Eternal Sunshine Doctors of life/death you control.\n\nIs a life defined by what you've done, or what you haven't done? Is an unhappy, but truthful, death inherently more or less valuable than a happy one built on lies? Is it moral to discard the memories of the living, of those you've met, those you've formed bonds with and lived your life with, in favor of a fantasy? Should the feelings of those affected be considered? What if the truth you're discarding is of a person who's already passed themselves; is it then ok for the remaining person to rebuild their memories of that person based on their own idealized image of them in their final moments?\n\nI find so much about these games to be beautiful, from the explicit to the implicit. Of note to me is the way your player-controlled doctors, memes and all, inadvertently come to know and understand people more than anyone else in their life has ever, or will ever. The implications of that are stunning. The way they explore the inner monologue of a complex and multifaceted person, confirming their life even as it ends, is deeply and wonderfully melancholy. It evokes in me the same type of emotions I felt as I watched Roy lament the loss of all his beautiful, unique, irreplaceable experiences under his final rainfall as he gave his classic \"Tears in the Rain\" speech. Except, here, they live on, in a way - through imperfect, snarky, oftentimes irreverent player-controlled characters. For me, at least, it colors said characters in a way that the dialogue by itself fails to do, and shrouds the entire thing in an air of depressing futility even as you struggle to give it meaning. There's always going to be another dying old man or woman, and the best you can do for them is get to know them to their core and then lie to them to make them happy. And then it's on to the next.\n\nThe beauty in this PARTICULAR game, for me, is the way it addresses things from a starkly different perspective than \"To the Moon\" did. It's difficult to really look too deeply into this without spoiling things, but, much as the sigmund minisodes did for the original game, the way the plot's set up really shows Kan's not at all unfamilliar with the questionable moral nature of what he's depicted here. It, for me, set the events of the previous game in a somewhat ambiguous light; did Johnny, and by extention, you, do the right thing? Does the 'right thing' even exist, or is the subject's subjective happiness all that's important? I don't know, but I kept asking those questions and trying to come up with my own answer.  I've always remembered the previous game, despite the half-decade since it came out, and I expect I'll remember this one just as vividly.  And to me, at least, that kind of emotional, personal connection is what \"Art\" is. Make of that what you will.\n\n\nAnyway. This game isn't the same constant emotive roller-coaster To the Moon was. It's also not as short, clocking in somewhere around 2.5 to 3x as long as TTM, at give-or-take 6 hours of gametime. And it doesn't shy away from cliches in its narrative, same as its predecessor. But, to me, at least, it seemed even more solidly put together, with very few wasted scenes. It's a story about getting to know someone extremely well even while knowing their time's up.\n\nYou don't have to have played 'A Bird Story' to enjoy this, and the only reference to it is passing and admirably restrained.  But it'll help squeeze a few more tears outta ya.\n\nAnd they will come. Not as soon as you might have been led to believe, but they'll come. I'm not one to cry at most sappy stuff, but this one's got emotional weight to it, and it knows when to unload it.

Com apenas a ferramenta rpg maker e muita criatividade na cabe\u00e7a, o artista Kan Gao trouxe uma das hist\u00f3rias mais belas e maduras j\u00e1 feitas para um videogame. Era incr\u00edvel como um jogo t\u00e3o simples poderia emocionar tanto, pois mal dava para ver o rosto dos personagens, mas mesmo assim voc\u00ea sentia aquela hist\u00f3ria. Desde do seu lan\u00e7amento existe uma promessa, que To The moon era apenas o primeiro cap\u00edtulo de uma grande saga e outras hist\u00f3rias igualmente maravilhosas seriam contadas tamb\u00e9m com o decorrer dessa saga. Depois de 6 anos, finalmente a prometida continua\u00e7\u00e3o de To The Moon foi lan\u00e7ada meio que de surpresa e eu j\u00e1 comprei na hora.\n\nPara quem n\u00e3o conhece, a saga de \u201cTo the moon\u201d se passa em um universo o qual uma empresa vende um servi\u00e7o de dar um conforto final a uma vida cheia de arrependimentos ou frustra\u00e7\u00f5es quando as pessoas est\u00e3o no leito de morte. A ideia \u00e9 mudar as mem\u00f3rias das pessoas para que em seus \u00faltimos momentos de vida elas possam pensar que viveram a vida que eles gostariam de ter tido. Para isso dois doutores tem que invadir as mem\u00f3rias da pessoa para descobrir como foi sua vida e assim criar uma ilus\u00e3o a qual a pessoa vai acreditar e gostar. No meio de tudo isso, v\u00e1rios momentos interessantes aparecem e ao menos em to the moon, eu me identifiquei com todos os personagens principais.\n\nJ\u00e1 fazia anos que esperava uma continua\u00e7\u00e3o de to the moon e vou confessar que at\u00e9 tinha perdido a f\u00e9 que algum dia ela chegaria. A s\u00e9rie chegou at\u00e9 ter um spin off chamado de \u201ca bird story\u201d, que contava um enredo, o qual apesar de ser simples, era impressionante tecnicamente ver um jogo mudo, o qual expressa tudo que o personagem estava sentido por s\u00edmbolos e express\u00f5es corporais. \u201cSe o spinoff j\u00e1 era legal, imagina o jogo oficial\u201d eu logo pensei.\n\nEstou explicando isso para que voc\u00eas entendam uma coisa: Finding Paradise \u00e9 decepcionante. Fiquem tranquilos, n\u00e3o vou entrar em spoilers, pois um jogo desse o qual \u00e9 f\u00e1cil estragar as surpresas, j\u00e1 que parece que o grande foco do game \u00e9 a virada de roteiro, o tal do plot twist que muitos chamam por ai. Sim, a dire\u00e7\u00e3o de arte, apesar de minimalista, continua bela. A trilha sonora tem excelentes composi\u00e7\u00f5es como j\u00e1 era esperado. O enredo continua tratando de assuntos corriqueiros da vida como arrependimentos, os quais ficam ainda mais intensos na durante a hora da morte. Mas eu simplesmente n\u00e3o comprei o drama do paciente da vez. A grande revela\u00e7\u00e3o do que o paciente realmente queria simplesmente me pareceu rid\u00edcula.\n\nClaro que fica bastante evidente que a equipe realmente queria fazer algo diferente de To the Moon. A trama se desenvolve de formas diferentes e o paciente n\u00e3o tem nada a ver com o do primeiro jogo. Ele tem esposa e filho vivos, meio que n\u00e3o se arrependia da vida que teve, mas queria mudar algo e cabe a voc\u00ea descobrir o que \u00e9. Tudo isso seria muito legal se o drama dele n\u00e3o fosse no m\u00ednimo infantil quando voc\u00ea descobre o que ele realmente sente falta. Me parece que tudo foi criado para te jogar na cara que toda a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o do mist\u00e9rio estava na sua frente o tempo inteiro e tem at\u00e9 uma parte do jogo que eles fazem quest\u00e3o de jogar isso detalhadamente na sua cara, com se tivesse o maior orgulho do mundo de ter enganado o espectador e realmente eu n\u00e3o pude prever, mas ficou faltando aquela empatia com a hist\u00f3ria, que pode ser um problema meu e eu esteja morto por dentro, j\u00e1 que inexplicavelmente Finding Paradise est\u00e1 tendo boas avalia\u00e7\u00f5es, por\u00e9m ningu\u00e9m pode dizer que fui com m\u00e1 vontade.\n\nEntendo que at\u00e9 em alguns pontos, os desenvolvedores mostraram que ouviram cr\u00edticas do primeiro e algumas coisas s\u00e3o diferentes, como os enigmas, que est\u00e3o mais engenhosos e realmente causam mais desafio e a dura\u00e7\u00e3o do jogo aumentou um pouco em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao seu antecessor, pena que esse tempo a mais foi gasto em criar um mist\u00e9rio, do que realmente emocionar.\n\nFinding Paradise tenta ser diferente, mas derrapa justamente nesse ponto. Eu sei que depois do cara fazer uma obra prima como To The Moon, \u00e9 normal n\u00e3o querer se prender, inovar e tal, mas o que importa no final \u00e9 o resultado, que ao meu ver foi bastante med\u00edocre. Me prendeu at\u00e9 o fim com a promessa de me surpreender e realmente entrega uma reviravolta interessante, com algo realmente imprevis\u00edvel, por\u00e9m eu n\u00e3o \u201ccomprei\u201d a hist\u00f3ria de vida do paciente da vez, sendo um desfecho bastante sem gra\u00e7a.\n", "timestamp_created": 1515452839, "timestamp_updated": 1515452839, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39193511": {"recommendationid": "39193511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029517641", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514314597}, "language": "english", "review": "All I can tell you is to buy this game, and ride the emotional story.

The way the story was paced and how it wasn't fully clear what will happen was executed well. While I would like to discuss the story more in depth, I believe doing so would spoil the game or change how you view it while playing.\n\n   $10 may seem a bit much for what amounts to a five-hour playthrough; though you must keep in mind you are paying for a story with game mechanics, not a game with a story. To elaborate, the game excluding the story is meh at best since it centers around exploration with little challenge. However, the game attempts to invest you in the story by having you decide how certain scenes play out in terms of what info you get first. It also leaves a few things to interpretation so not every person will be impacted the same way.\n\n   I personally like this over Freebird's other works mainly because it hits closer to home, I highly recommend trying out all their games though since each has a unique story that isn't so predictable.\n", "timestamp_created": 1515395153, "timestamp_updated": 1515395153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580153", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39174412": {"recommendationid": "39174412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086007756", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 413, "last_played": 1515392152}, "language": "english", "review": "Every game he has made has been a story that is worthy of just sitting down and playing through it from that opening music all the way to the closing music.", "timestamp_created": 1515394141, "timestamp_updated": 1515394141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39174169": {"recommendationid": "39174169", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294574921", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 275, "last_played": 1515029157}, "language": "english", "review": "Finding Paradise is the 2nd chapter of the \"Sigmund Corp.\" saga, created by Kan Gao and Freebird Games. The game is, as you may have noticed, the direct sequel to To the Moon, and follows the main protagonists from that game, Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts, as they try to fulfill the wish of the now dying and bedridden Colin Reeds. Colin's final wish, unlike Johnny's from the first game, is a bit complicated : he feels he hasn't lived a fulfulling life, so he goes to Sigmund Corp. for help. This causes tension between him, his elderly wife, and his adult son, as they feel like he's giving up his memories of them for better ones. But the thing is, Colin directly asked Sigmund Corp. to change as little as possible when it came to his family.\n\nNow, the plot sounds kinda similar to To the Moon in some ways, I know. But trust me when I say this : stuff gets interesting fast, and about halfway, or two thirds through, something happens that will probably catch you [i] way [/i] off guard. I won't say what it is, but when it happened, I was really shocked. It was a major curveball, and a pretty good one, as you don't expect it to happen.\n\nAnyways, moving on.\n\n[h1] Is this as good as To the Moon? (Also, the writing.) [/h1]\n\nIn my opinion, yes. While I feel this one was quite a bit ambitious compared to the first one, it still succeeded extremely well. In fact, right after I finished To the Moon, I bought this a few hours later, and started it almost immediately after it finished installing. I was so hyped after playing the first one that I couldn't resist buying this. And boy, it was awesome.\n\nFirst off, I'm going to talk about Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts. After seeing them in the first game, and how good their chemistry was together, as well as how much I liked the characters, I couldn't wait to see what antics they'd be up to this time. I wasn't disappointed at all. Again, Kan Gao shows his skill at writing by not only making these characters more relatable, he also succeeded in making them funnier. Like, oh my god, the dialogue in this one is hilarious. Is it as funny and as heartwarming as To the Moon? I wouldn't say so, but when it's funny, it's funny. Just like when it's sad, it's sad, and when it's peaceful, it's peaceful.\n\nColin is also, surprisingly, relatable. While I couldn't relate to him as much as Johnny from the first game, I still liked seeing his life, and how it went. I'm not kidding when I say that this and To the Moon are two of the most funny, feel-good, and relatable games I've ever played. While the story is mostly tragic, as Colin is dying, and Eva and Neil are trying their best to fulfill his wish, it has its fair share of happy and warming moments, just like the first one did. Colin reminds me of my grandparents, just like Johnny did. (Read the review of To the Moon to have a better understanding of that.)\n\nThere is also some other characters in the game with pretty good writing, but the reason I'm not talking about them here is because it's honestly kinda hard for a person like me to bring up characters that are integral to the plot that aren't the main characters without spoiling something huge about them. So, yeah.\n\n[h1] Gameplay. [/h1]\n\nThe gameplay is not too different from the first game, as expected. It does have some cool new features, however, but I won't talk about them here. Like Johnny, you travel through Colin's memories, finding mementos, and then move to the next memory. Unlike the first game, however, this game has a pretty neat twist with the memory travel, but it is also a pretty big spoiler, so I won't mention it here. You also get to use the WASD keys, which I'm pretty sure you couldn't use in the first game, so that's a small plus from me.\n\n[h1] The soundtrack. [/h1]\n\nJust like the first one, Finding Paradise has a great, moving, and beautiful soundtrack. The music is also a good way of telling things. For example, in a few specific scenes in the game, a low, ominous song will play, and that is a good indicator of either these two things : something's wrong, or something bad is about to happen. And that does happen, by the way. \n\nThere isn't much else to say, so let's finish this review.\n\n[h1] Overall opinion. [/h1]\n\nFinding Paradise is a great sequel to the amazing To the Moon, with more great writing, some cool new gameplay changes and sequences here and there, some funny callbacks to the first game, another great story, among other things. When it ended, I wanted and craved for more. I was so invested in the characters and plot that it felt like I got smacked in the face when it ended. That's not as bad as it sounds, but that's what happens when you get really into a game. There's also quite a few questions I have after playing it that I will also have to wait for to be answered, which is fair, but hard to wait for. But overall, awesome game.\n\nFinal score : 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1515393229, "timestamp_updated": 1515393229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39172660": {"recommendationid": "39172660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315289992", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 311, "last_played": 1515383061}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4eba\u8981\u9762\u5bf9\u7684\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u82e6\u96be\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u6539\u53d8\u81ea\u5df1\u5185\u5fc3\u7684\u51b3\u5fc3\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1515387036, "timestamp_updated": 1515387036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39172117": {"recommendationid": "39172117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107383191", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 287, "last_played": 1515830456}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u771f\u662f\u4e2a\u597d\u6e38\u620f\u5462", "timestamp_created": 1515384533, "timestamp_updated": 1515384533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39172103": {"recommendationid": "39172103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055462705", "num_games_owned": 412, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 367, "last_played": 1515379753}, "language": "norwegian", "review": "*** First off; this is not a game for those interested in an RPG, but a interactive story where any minor RPG elements are geeky inside jokes.

Come il suo predecessore, anche Finding Paradise continua ad essere retto quasi interamente dalla sua storia (il che, purtroppo, limita molto la longevit\u00e0 alle sole cinque-sei ore richieste per completarlo). Continua a narrare di eventi legati a tematiche come testamento biologico, solitudine, e sull\u2019etica di \u201cgiocare a fare Dio\u201d con la mente di una persona, seppur moribonda. Tuttavia lo fa in maniera pi\u00f9 matura, senza forzare l\u2019attenzione su certi punti, che spesso emergono naturalmente o restano sottintesi come a dire \u201cci siamo, sappiamo che avete capito, non c\u2019\u00e8 bisogno di scendere nel dettaglio\u201d. \n\nQuesto lascia liberi di concentrarsi sulla storia, anche se purtroppo lascia una certa ripetitivit\u00e0 nella parte centrale dove il giocatore \u00e8 libero di fare tutte le ipotesi del caso. Su questo, purtroppo, siamo obbligati a mandar gi\u00f9 il boccone: \u00e8 un compromesso che non poteva essere realizzato altrimenti senza distruggere il ritmo cercato nel narrare di quell\u2019orbita decadente verso un punto centrale nella linea temporale di Colin (immaginate essenzialmente Memento di Christopher Nolan).\n\nUn altro punto di divergenza con il passato \u00e8 nella figura di Neil Watts: se in precedenza i suoi siparietti comici erano usati in maniera pi\u00f9 infantile e sparsi per la storia, quasi a ricordare al giocatore che nonostante la tetra premessa, si tratta di un\u2019avventura mirata a rendere felice qualcuno, in Finding Paradise i momenti dell\u2019esuberante dottore partner della pi\u00f9 pragmatica Eva diventano pi\u00f9 dilazionati, ma decisamente pi\u00f9 esagerati e sopra le righe. Anche in questo caso \u00e8 un\u2019evoluzione necessaria, sia per stemperare la drammaticit\u00e0 di certe scene (roba da magone pesante allo stomaco), sia per mettere in campo un ormai inevitabile passaggio verso un terzo capitolo che, probabilmente, andr\u00e0 a spiegare i vari misteri presenti dietro la complessa figura del dottore.\n\nTirando le somme, Kan Gao mette sul piatto un titolo che riesce a reggersi sulle sue gambe anche senza conoscere gli altri titoli nella serie, ma che ne trae vantaggio quando questi vengono presi come un prodotto unico.

I came in expecting just pretty much To the Moon, but what I got was so much more and so much better. The gameplay has been improved from TtM by things like Character Customization [spoiler]and even a few battles toward the end.[/spoiler] The puzzle system was a little confusing, though. I never felt like I truly got the puzzle system.\nThe story is also improved. There are multiple nods to and jokes from TtM, but it's still playable if you haven't played TtM. It got VERY deep toward the end and almost got psychological-horror at some parts. It wasn't as sad as TtM, but it was quite dramatic.\nI don't cry to these sorts of things. Well, at least outwardly. My soul still cries even when I don't myself.\n\n\nAlso, if you play this game, try not to have a sister humming meme music in the background the whole time.

Well, okay, there were some minisodes inbetween, and A Bird Story also technically came between, or long before, it's a bit weird with timehops, considering these are games about memories-- well, it's a sequel, in any case. If you haven't played To the Moon yet, play that first, because this is a story-heavy game, and you won't really get the full impact without knowing Part 1.\nIn Finding Paradise, you play once again the dynamic duo of Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosaline, a pair of scientists working for the Sigmund Corporation. Sigmund's mission is to make people's dreams come true, in a way - when somebody who signed a contract with them is on their deathbed, they send their experts to enter the dying person's brain, and with a few key changes, they make them think that they've lived the happiest life they could have lived, be that as a rockstar, in a dreamjob of theirs, or with a specific person they've let slip away. And of course, the case our two doctors have to deal with this time isn't as straightforward, else they wouldn't have made a game around it. \nTo say anything more would creep upon spoiler territory, so I shan't say more and instead get to the critiquing. There are some minor niggles right off the bat - the game being locked at a very low resolution and a somewhat stiff interface spring to mind, though that's a rather small deal, all things considered. To the Moon affected me very personally, and that was due to two circumstances: 1. I was emotionally unstable at the time of playing, and  2. it featured a character that very directly spoke to me and my own past. But this time around I've taken some pills, and there isn't such a direct hotwire link to my nostalgia center. So Finding Paradise is under a lot more scrutiny.\nMind you, even with me  thinking a lot more critically, it's still a fine game - very well-written, very funny, and still touching enough. It's just that... With a whole other game and two minisodes fleshing them out, I really care a lot about Neil and Eva. They're some of the most delightful characters I've had the pleasure to control in my years of gaming. In the minisodes, there has been some setup for... 'events' concerning Neil, and that foreshadowing has been picked up on big time during this game. But then, when I reached the ending, that plotpoint didn't get any real pay-off. Which I wouldn't really mind that much, because that'd mean even more story to come, but... Well, Finding Paradise's ending came very abruptly. Things were resolved very swiftly and weirdly easily, and my internal plot map indicated at least one more hour of story before the end. So, the resolution for the patient's arc left me a bit cold, and the Neil arc just left me cliffhanging. So I guess my one actual problem with Finding Paradise is that the ending was too early, and too flimsy.\nBut all in all, that doesn't make it a bad game. Heck, once the next part comes out and (hopefully) picks up on that dangling plot thread, this complaint will be nulled. So, I'd still recommend it.

lovely lovely game that just made me cry like a little baby! :) A wonderful story with wonderful music and artwork, it continues and even improves the gameplay and the themes we saw in To The Moon. A little different, but very familiar and does not disappoint. While the tone is definitely sad, I loved the bits of humour as well. The two main characters are really really great but the rest of the cast is equally good too. Oh, and the mystery! I hoped we would find out everything in this one but we did not so I guess there is still something to look forward to! I am such a fan of these games, they are really amazing, so if you are looking for something story-driven, RPG-style, creative and soulful, this is your stuff right here.

More expressive pixelated people! Characters run instead of doing a leisurely walk during dire events! The full potential of gaming in 2017 has been reached!!!!\n\nAll joking aside (beside the bit more expressive characters and running cuz those are things in the game *spoilers*), this was a fantastic installment to the \"To the Moon\" series. (Ramble/didn't proofread this review: START!)\n\nFor newcomers to this lovely series, we all welcome you with tear-soaked arms and discussion as we piece what's going on behind the scenes! Finding Paradise is the second episode following To the Moon. \n\nThough you don't need to play To the Moon necessarily... I would recommend playing through it along with the free minisodes thats included in the game files. You get a feel of how this game works, a lovely heartwarming/heartbreaking story, and you will be supporting a brillant man and his team at Freebird Games. (*cough* And can understand a lot of topics and theorizing that is occuring in the forums/discussions *cough*).\n\nIf you can't due to time or any other reason, start with A Bird Story, a prolouge if you will to Finding Paradise with the main person being the client in FP. Though the plot is summarized to a sentence in the FP, this one hour story will provide some background information on why Colin the client/patient, acted the way he did as he grew older and wished for what he wanted.\n\nFor returning peeps... You probbaly already got the game and OST! (haha) But those sitting on the fence, I will say Finding Paradise stray a bit from what To the Moon does. When I played TtM, it was bittersweet with its conclusion, happy to see that the wish came true but sad that this was only seen all the way through by three (four?) people. But for FP,  I was left questioning a lot of things  once the dust settles. \n\nFinding Paradise still has the two quirky doctors we fell in love with from the first part with addition shenanigans and hijinks. There are a number of stuble callbacks to the previous episode and the added content which is a huge plus (and possibly a jab at how long it has been since TtM). Though the game didn't give any groundbreaking or such information or clues to that one particular person, it just makes me more hyped for what's to come when it arrives! (Also puns, quite a bit of puns.)\n\nMusic is spot on with some returning soundtracks from A Bird Story and some of Kan Gao's previous work (loved the inclusion of The Mirror Lied so fitting). Aside the doctors, the two/three main individuals have an instument to them so you get a connection when seeing the evnets play out and by hearing the music. Relaxing tunes and some that makes you want to up your walking pace a bit (which I am again glad that the characters can run now! haha).\n\nOnly complaint is we have to wait again for the next part (sigh) but I will be waiting with tissues and a notepad open to jot down any foreshadowing statements that may be said or done. (Because we all saw that one possible foreshadow, Gao!)

Didn't pack quite as much of a punch as To The Moon did (honestly kind of hard to top that) but extremely good and the more i thought about it i think almost everybody can relate somewhat to the main character's plight for various reasons making one scene in particular all the more devastating. Major spoilers ahead [spoiler] I think everybody has someone waiting for them at the end of the road that they want to share their life's story with, even if theyre not real, and everybody has regrets, I think everyone has a Faye of their own waiting for them (or in my case a little furry thing called Samantha) [/spoiler] The story overall was really good, felt like it took a bit too long to get going but i did play through A Bird Story so i felt like i already knew the patient a bit more than the setup really took but i understand not everyone playing this might've played it. Really can't say enough about the story/mystery in this one, a couple of moments completely blew me away.

Story hit me harder than a truck full of cement, even holding up against To the Moon. Finding Paradise was wound from such an intricate, complex, and beautiful premise that the reader who is able to experience all the plot threads, some significantly relating back to a previous work of Gao, will be given a profound experience. For myself, to the disagreement of some, Gao has outdone himself here and delivered something beyond his previous To the Moon emotionally, creatively, and topically. I cannot stress how beautiful the idea is and how excellent the execution for the critical moments. If you want to experience an emotionally gripping tale, then Finding Paradise is a must.\n\nMy Beefs and nitpicks: (for Gao mostly and not for consumers, go read this story regardless):\n-Lots of padding in the plot, functionally a lot of the scenes could be eliminated with zero detriment to the main structure of the story. This padded pacing could be trimmed to the benefit of more seamless consumption. Some padded scenes add entertainment value via humor, which is fine, but other padded scenes have no humor and just serve as unuseful transitions between plots points. This is primarily in act 1.\n\n-Minor Spoiler alert\n[spoiler] Cutting back on the fantasy elements in Act 3 is better for the tone. I realize Gao's intentions with the fantasy and minigame elements are to add humor and entertainment value for the final arc of the story, but Gao has executed the fantasy elements so creatively and effectively that it crosses a tonal line and starts skewing the whole tone of the story,\n if only temporarily. This new tone is so unified in its creative fantasy elements that it becomes disconnected from the tragic-comedy construction previously (and into something akin to an outrageous final-fantasy esque comedy). It briefly took me out of the immersion of the main tone of the story, and I believe this is a drawback that outweighs the entertainment value the fantasy provides.[/spoiler]\n\nUltra technical nitpicks:\n-The game should remember the player's facing direction after solving the mementos. As is, the game defaults to orienting down afterwards, which in most cases is a different facing direction than the one needed for operating the memento.\n-The sound bug from mashing the action button after shooting the last memory link into the mementos is still not fixed from To the Moon.", "timestamp_created": 1515071323, "timestamp_updated": 1515071323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39047557": {"recommendationid": "39047557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198422531836", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 776, "last_played": 1515070929}, "language": "english", "review": "I knew this game would make me cry but I still wasn't prepared. \nEverything about this game is beautiful just like the first one was, and I hope they make a third because I NEED to know things!

Some of the gameplay segments caught me off-guard, but I enjoyed them and they weren't unwelcomed at all.\n\nThe game's pacing, well, being a story-heavy game, is very relaxed. It's not something you should speedrun. It should be experienced, felt, and read properly. Everything should be interacted and discovered so you don't miss any bit of detail. And the music?

To The Moon is obviously an incredibly difficult act to follow and I wasn't expecting this game to surpass it, but I feel as though it really dropped the ball. \n\nTo The Moon had a bunch of problems: slow movement speed, out-of-place humor that interupts the story at bad times, unnecessary puzzles that really only serve as padding, etc. yet I could easily look past all that for the phenomenal story it told. I don't think I can say the same for this one.\n\nI don't want to spoil the story too much, but it wasn't nearly as good, in my opinion. The individual memories didn't feel that significant; rather, they felt somewhat bland and generic. There's a ton of plot threads introduced in the miniseries and the first game that are left unresolved, and aren't even really expanded upon. My main problem is with the central plotline though; [spoiler] the entire plotline with Faye felt incredibly bizarre. Like, it's a story about an imaginary friend? I liked some aspects, like subverting the ideas put forth in the first game about whether one should even bother changing memories, and I liked the thematic idea of living with regrets and being satisfied. However, just... the entire existance of Faye, and the relationship that Colin had with her was very offputting for me. The weird battles with her also felt completely unnecessary.  [/spoiler] \n\nHonestly, without padding, I feel as though this game would have only taken 2 hours, and while a good story can be told in that amount of time, I don't think that this game did that. I really wanted to like this game, and statistically you  probably would if you played TTM, as shown by the other steam reviews.

I wish I had better vocabulary to describe this game! This is a real, legit review that I NEEDED to give to this game.\n\nFinding Paradise Review\n\nI'd love to point out the amazing graphics. Everything is well drawn and each level is appealing to the eye with its vibrant tone. When I first played, I couldn't help but spend my time looking at every detail in each of the levels and take it in for what it is.\n\nThe soundtrack is out of this world astounding. Every track it had for every bit of the game fit PERFECTLY. I can't say any bit of the tracks were out of place. They fit together like a puzzle.\n\nThe story is also quite amazing and original in my eyes, I can't say much about the story without spoiling it. Every bit of the plot keeps you glued to the screen, much like a good book. It's emotional, it's funny, it's everything you would expect out of a 10/10 story. Every moment if it be sad, or silly. It will compensate it and not make it fall flat. \n\nThe only downside to this, at least in my opinion are certain characters. There were a FEW likeable characters, though most of them seemed like any typical trait character I would see in some other story oriented game. However, this still gets a 10/10 for what this game had to offer me!\n\nYou just have to experience this game for yourself and enjoy everything it has to offer!\n\nMy review may be poorly written, but I needed to express my feelings for this awesome story oriented game.

Eeeehhh, it depends.\nI felt like it wasn't anywhere close as a tearjerker as \"To the moon\", mainly because this acts more like a set-up kinda chapter. Don't get me wrong, the plot was good and all, but when you reach the end of the game (which I'm not gonna spoil), it's becomes obvious that the folks at FreeBird used the whole \"changing-memories-of-dying-patients-shenanigans\" as a plot-device for the \"Greater Sub-Plot\" (Poetic license). \nThat's not bad per-se, they're just playing the long game which, if done correctly, can deliver a huge payoff in the end. It's just that with having two installments of the same series 5 years apart from each other, doesn't look like this payoff will be delivered anytime soon.\nAnd don't get this as a \"this dude is just complaining and calling them slow and yada yada fuck off\", cuz I really don't mean that.

I will always be there to protect you.\t[/h1]\n\n[b] Introduction\t[/b]\n\nWith Finding Paradise being the sequel to in both mine and so many other opinions, one of the saddest games ever created, To The Moon, there was definitely an extremely high standard this game had to meet. Not surprisingly however, Kan Gao has yet again created another masterpiece, worthy of as much praise as the last game. Through the perspective of both Dr. Watts and Dr. Rosaline, you are again thrown into a not so distant future where people in the final days of their lives have the option of having their memories altered so that whatever dreams or regrets they had in life can artificially come true, ultimately letting them die happy, or as seen with the name of the game, help them to \"Find Paradise\". Such a premise for a story is evidently unique beyond words, and clearly is already a very emotional topic, and yet the journey that is created through the amazing story that accompanies it for a topic already so special makes it such a powerful and moving game.\n\n[b] Emotional Level and Music[/b]\n\nAs someone who rarely cries, I have no shame in saying I bawled my eyes multiple times playing this. The story was perfectly executed once again, with Kan Gao and everyone at Freebird Games creating such an emotional journey traveling through the mind of another dying man that if it were a movie, it would receive numerous awards. While I could go on endlessly about the story, the biggest factor that many people probably already know is the music. Whether they were trying to get you to cry, feel extremely freaked out, or even cracking up laughing, in each and every scene they hit the nail. They had me tearing up in parts of the story just due to the music alone. If you are going to buy the game, do yourself a favor and spend the few extra dollars to buy the soundtrack, it is a great investment.\n\n[b] Gameplay\t[/b]\n\nOne last thing I wanted to mention was the gameplay. While both To The Moon and Finding Paradise both play out almost like a movie, Finding Paradise introduced something that To The Moon didn't have as much of, and that is both humor and gameplay. I was surprised how much I was laughing at some of the bizarre and funny encounters that constantly occured throughout the story, something that wasn't nonexistent in To The Moon, but definitely was much less. At first I thought it might take away from the level of other emotions the game would have, yet of course through the exceptional story telling and music, my fear was completely unneeded. And with the added gameplay, without spoling anything, all I can really say is you need to see it for yourself.\n\n[b] Conclusion\t[/b]\n\nOverall, I would consider Finding Paradise an extremely worthy successor to To the Moon. While I think the music for To The Moon is my personal favorite, I found Finding Paradise to be a better game overall, something you absolutely won't regret picking up. If there had to be one thing I found wrong with the game, the only thing I would be able to come up with is that there is no in-game screenshots\n\nA Must Have\n[10/10]", "timestamp_created": 1514964908, "timestamp_updated": 1514966894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39001957": {"recommendationid": "39001957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004845579", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514963023}, "language": "english", "review": "I honestly went into this game with the mindset that Gao couldn't top \"To the Moon\".

It starts off with the doctors trying to figure out how to please their latest client Colin Reeds, the main protagonist of A Bird Story. His request is fairly simple, he wants to feel like he\u2019s lived a full life, but without changing anything major from it. Alright, maybe it\u2019s not so simple. With that, the doctors are off trying to reconstruct his memories so they can make his dying wish come true.\n\nI was elated to see that Finding Paradise was able to take the few shortcomings of To the Moon and improve upon them. It offered a bit more variety with the gameplay, although it was still a heavily story driven game that holds your hand through most of it. The puzzles that were once so easy my four year old could solve them, have now been replaced by a new puzzle system that gets increasingly harder and more creative as you go. The few new hilarious minigames were a welcome addition as well. While the story in this one wasn\u2019t quite as poignant as in To the Moon, it was all around a much better and more enjoyable game and I cannot wait for the next episode.\"\n\nFor our full review visit our page [url=https://waytoomanygames.com/2018/01/03/review-finding-paradise-pc/] HERE\t[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1514953479, "timestamp_updated": 1514953479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38997697": {"recommendationid": "38997697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009279165", "num_games_owned": 436, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 268, "last_played": 1514949417}, "language": "english", "review": ";-;7", "timestamp_created": 1514950280, "timestamp_updated": 1514950280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470446", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38997448": {"recommendationid": "38997448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198374173526", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 306, "last_played": 1514945417}, "language": "english", "review": "this is such a beautiful, it has great music, hilaious momements, and a HUGE plot twist.

Detailed review is in bottom.\n\nAs you read this review, keep in mind that I'm heavily comparing this game to \"To The Moon\" as it is a sequal to said game. If you think that's unfair, so be it, but it's a pretty good benchmark by which to judge \"Finding Paradise.\" \nWhen I rate the game, a 0 is abysmal, 5 is average, 10 is near flawless.\n\nSo, my To The Moon benmark is -\n10/10 Story\n9/10 Soundtrack\n3/10 Gameplay\n0/10 Controls\n\nOverall - 9/10\n\nCompared to that, here's my Finding Paradise rating - \n8/10 Story\n10/10 Soundtrack\n4/10 Gameplay\n0/10 Controls\n\nOverall - 8/10\n\nSTORY (What you're here for) - \nI get what Kan was going for. I really do. And I appreciate the theme he was trying to drive home. It just didn't resonate as hard as TTM's story did. That's not to say that the story isn't good. It's emotional and interesting. But it could have done a few things better - \n-Abstract theme. \nRather than being a story that delivers a message, Finding Paradise is a message that cloaks itself in a story. The story and characters take a backseat to the message Kan is trying to deliver, and the story suffers naratively for it. \n-Convoluted, not complex.\nThe story loses a lot of the steam it builds up during the first half by pulling a \"twist\" out and undermining one of its characters (Faye) rather signifigantly. The best way I can describe it is that \"simple\" goes a long way. TTM pulled a twist with one of its characters, but that twist was built on a simple premise, memory loss. Instead in FP, we get a Matrix/Fruedian-esque explanation for the twist that confuses the player more that anything. And like I said, the character's twist isn't even really that complex. I saw it coming long before the game revealed it in its \"AHA!\" moment. The plot tried to squeeze a harder payoff from this than it actually earned.\n-Side plot with little payoff.\nThroughout the story, a sideplot develops with Watts. It is given neither a resolution nor an explanation, yet takes up a signifigant amount of time. I understand it will weave its way into the sequels, but that's no excuse to leave it narratively weak in this entry. Just because this is part of a larger story doesn't mean we shouldn't get a decent resolution here. \n-What did Colin want?\nI'm still confused on this one. I get what he says he wanted, and what he truly desired and all that, but I still felt as if his own wish undermined the purpose of the whole story. I can't say much beyond that without diving into spoilers. I just feel as though the plot's theme could have been expressed better if Colin's motives were more clearly fleshed out towards the end. Kind of like Johnny's wish, and how it becomes more clear what he really wants in the end. And just to make it clear, I don't believe the story intentionally made Colin's desire unclear for creative purposes. Where TTM hit a home run in pulling the rug out from under you and giving Johnny's true desire impact, FP comes just short of squarely hitting the ball and leaves the player a little confused.\n\nDespite these issues I had with the story, it still hit enough emotional notes to be satisfying. It is still great, but not as brilliant as TTM's story was. Where TTM was a narrative puzzle where every thread fit perfectly together, FP has a few rough edges and out of place pieces, but it's still a great story with an even better message. \n\nSOUNDTRACK - \nEven better than TTM. They weaved the soundtrack into the story even more, which I appreciate. Kan outdid himself with the game's music. Bravo. \n\nGAMEPLAY - \n. . . . better than TTM? That's all I can really say, and that is not saying much at all. When I say \"better\" I mean it's more present and less frustrating, but it still feels in the way, like a roadblock that's not really part of the game. It feels neither intergrated into the story, nor fun or interesting to ineract with. At least there's a lot less frustrating traversing due to the smaller enviorments compared to TTM.\n\nCONTROLS - \nAwful. There's no excuse. Moving is a pain. Controling characters is a pain. Characters will often move where you don't want them to and interact with objects you have no intention of using. The interface is still annoying to navigate despite being bare-bones. It's like Freebird Games learned nothing from the complaints TTM got. Seriously. Fix it for the sequel. \n\nSUMMARY - \nPretty good. The story could have been better in comparison to TTM, but if TTM didn't exist, this would be a 9/10 or 10/10 easy. Soundtrack was even better, I can really tell Kan learned a lot between TTM and FP. Gameplay is still more of a nuisance than enjoyable and the controls are abysmal, but we're all here for the story anyway.

But in this game, it's quite easy to figure out all the truth behind Colin's memory. No peculiar diseases and twin brother any more, all he had, and all we have witnessed, is just loneliness.\n\nTBH, it's not quite strange for me about the existence of Faye, it's also not strange for me why Faye disppeared. I'm super introverted when I grew up, I didn't have some friends and cannot walk into others' world. I put myself into books, video games to find something interesting to fill up the hole inside me.\nEven though I has changed a lot, the feeling is so familiar that I know there is always a little quiet lonely girl.\n[spoiler]The illusion which we created to protect ourselves from external world, support us to stand against criticism and prejudice, would always finally fade away when we step out of our small virtual world.\nThe time has to come, and we have to say goodbye to our Faye.\nThen we may get lost in the hustle and bustle, we may encounter someone special and have a happy life until the last moment. But how about our first 'real' friend? \nColin's last regret is very subtle but also may be so meaningful to every one used to live alone in his/her own small world with some imaginary friends.[/spoiler]\n\nThe music is awesome and graphic is even better than To The Moon.

But that doesn't stop it from being great.\nExplore and find the truth behind a dying mans memories along side the 2 specialists you'll be playing as.\nIf you love To The Moon or A Bird's story (Which is this game's prequel but is seperate from the full game) than you'll love this game as well. \nThank you for reading. <3", "timestamp_created": 1514839842, "timestamp_updated": 1514839842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38948164": {"recommendationid": "38948164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258602771", "num_games_owned": 438, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514835022}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u901a\u5173\u4e4b\u540e\u53bb\u770b\u4e86\u770b\u4e4b\u524d\u300aA bird story\u300b\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u2026\u2026\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u5df1\u592a\u5929\u771f\u4e86OTL\n\u770b\u5b8c\u79d1\u6797\u7684\u4e00\u751f\u89c9\u5f97\u5fc3\u91cc\u5f88\u9178\u6da9\uff0c\u9e1f\u7269\u8bed\u91cc\u7684\u5947\u5e7b\u548c\u68a6\u5883\uff0c\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u65e0\u6cd5\u5206\u8fa8\u3001\u4ea4\u7ec7\u800c\u6210\u7684\u5e7b\u60f3\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u65e0\u6cd5\u5206\u6e05\u695a\u90a3\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d77\u56e0\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u518d\u591a\u8bf4\u5c31\u662f\u5267\u900f\u4e86\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u611f\u89c9\u4e5f\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u8be5\u8bf4\u4ec0\u4e48\u3002\n\u53ea\u6709\u7a9d\u817f\u4e0a\u7761\u89c9\u7684\u732b\u80fd\u629a\u6170\u6211\u7684\u5fc3\u7075\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u6bd4\u8d77\u5267\u60c5\u6211\u5176\u5b9e\u66f4\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u4e8c\u4eba\u7ec4\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u7b49\u756a\u5916\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1514835901, "timestamp_updated": 1514835901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39425411": {"recommendationid": "39425411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198376565792", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514292760}, "language": "italian", "review": "Finding Paradise \u00e8 un gioiello splendente.\n\nChi ha gi\u00e0 giocato il famosissimo To The Moon trover\u00e0 molte differenze in Finding Paradise, ma al contempo molte sorprese e una maggiore maturit\u00e0 espressiva. Al contrario, chi non ha idea di cosa sia To The Moon, trover\u00e0 semplicemente un gioco squisito e toccante, che con delicatezza lo accompagna attraverso una storia narrata con una grafica minimalista, ma una potenza emotiva che dimostra, ancora una volta, come non serva un budget stellare per fare della vera arte.\n\nHo scritto gi\u00e0 una recensione lunga e approfondita (che trovate in parte qua sotto, ed \u00e8 ricca di spoiler) e non si pu\u00f2 parlare molto della trama senza appunto svelare molti dettagli, ma quel che conta \u00e8 che troviamo di nuovo i due scienziati alle prese col un macchinario che pu\u00f2 scrutare e manipolare i ricordi, una persona in punto di morte che vuole realizzare il suo ultimo desiderio attraverso la modifica dei ricordi stessi, e una complessa situazione morale e psicologica che richieder\u00e0 pi\u00f9 di un atto per essere snodata.\n\nMeno fazzoletti, forse, ma molta pi\u00f9 profondit\u00e0.\n\nVoto: 10/10 con lode.\n\n***\n\n[i]Ci\u00f2 che rese To The Moon un capolavoro fu, soprattutto, l\u2019enorme carico di sentimenti che, con pochissimi mezzi, il gruppo Freebird riusc\u00ec a far emergere nei giocatori. Con la sua grafica retr\u00f2 (che richiama gli rpg degli anni 90, dagli Zelda ai Final Fantasy) e con una colonna sonora dominata dai suoni del pianoforte, To The Moon raccont\u00f2 non la storia migliore di tutte, ma una delle pi\u00f9 toccanti di sempre.\n\nCon queste premesse, Finding Paradise arriva con un\u2019eredit\u00e0 pesante, come se fosse il figlio di una grande rockstar, o il sequel di Star Wars. Era, in effetti, impossibile replicare la potenza espressiva del suo predecessore, e gli appassionati, aspettandosi di usare un\u2019adeguata quantit\u00e0 di fazzoletti, erano gi\u00e0 pronti psicologicamente ad affrontare un nuovo fiume di emozioni.\n\nFortunatamente, Finding Paradise si distanzia da To The Moon, pur mantenendo ambienti e personaggi pixelosi, e l\u2019immancabile pianoforte in sottofondo. Finding Paradise trova la forza nelle sue gambe e, soprattutto, nella sua rinnovata impalcatura filosofica, che lo rendono un gioco decisamente pi\u00f9 maturo e profondo.\n\n[...]\n\nIn Finding Paradise, l\u2019elaborazione psicologica raggiunge un livello di complessit\u00e0 rara, e viene snodata in almeno due grandi tematiche.\n\nLa prima \u00e8 l\u2019impossibilit\u00e0 di conoscere davvero chi ci sta accanto. Colin e la moglie Sofia, sposati da decenni e genuinamente innamorati, sono una coppia di anziani d\u2019altri tempi, in cui l\u2019amore non conosce date di scadenza, e la noia \u00e8 una parte dell\u2019equazione, non una variabile antitetica alle passioni. Tuttavia, quando Colin decide di usufruire dei servizi della \u201cSigmund Corporation\u201d, Sofia ha una reazione al contempo rassegnata e sconvolta: da un lato, la richiesta del marito coincide con l\u2019impressione che lei ha della sua tristezza di fondo, della mancanza di senso che permea ogni suo sguardo; dall\u2019altro, modificare i ricordi pu\u00f2 significare distruggere tutto, e nessun rimorso \u00e8 tanto importante da far rinunciare a un\u2019intera vita costruita insieme. Inutile \u00e8 il tentativo di Colin di spiegarle che no, il loro matrimonio \u00e8 saldo, ed \u00e8 veramente felice con lei: Sofia sa che manca un tassello, e non pu\u00f2 aggiungerlo lei. In questo senso, l\u2019umore di Colin ricorda (ma non si sovrappone a) quello delle persone depresse: pur con una vita piena, non ha veramente tutto, e sa che gli manca uno sfuggente ma doloroso qualcosa.\n\nLa seconda \u00e8 la capacit\u00e0 di autorealizzarsi. Finding Paradise non cede semplicemente alla metafora del \u201cla felicit\u00e0 \u00e8 dentro di te\u201d, o che \u201cnel tuo inconscio c\u2019\u00e8 tutto ci\u00f2 che serve\u201d: Faye parrebbe un\u2019ottima rappresentante di questa vulgata, ma durante tutta la storia capiamo che non \u00e8 cos\u00ec semplice, e la spicciola filosofia new-age non basta. A dire il vero, Faye somiglia molto alla definizione che Jung (noto psicoanalista) d\u00e0 di \u201cAnima\u201d.[/i]\n\n(recensione completa

them) and yet again, it's clear that Freebird know what they're doing. I had high expectations on this one, since To The Moon is one of the best stories I've ever experienced, and I walked away happy to have them personally fulfilled. However, this is a different experience from To The Moon, and while it speaks the same language, it has a different accent to it which might make it have a more specific audience.\n\nWhat this means is that there is an emotional story in there, but it might not be as accessable. I happen to have a certain perspective that made the story hit pretty hard emotionally, but everyone might not have this; on the other hand, there is a lot in there that is applicable to everyone, which makes it hard to say what kind of experience you will have. What I can say is that your experience will most certainly be a positive one, as long as you keep in mind that this is not To The Moon.\n\nSo, with that out of the way, it's worth mentioning what has been updated since To The Moon. There is a lot more actual gameplay elements in this one, weaving in some references to classic games on its way (let's just say that Dr. Watts has been busy). It has more humor, has a few more fancy animations that might surprise you and maybe most importantly, expands more on Watts' story outside of the memories themselves. This also makes the experience slightly less focused, however, and the value of the game is different because of it.\n\nHere's the question: Is this better than To The Moon? I would say no. To The Moon was more well crafted and slightly more clever in how it delivered its emotional charge. Is Finding Paradise still a great game? Oh yes. It stands far enough apart that it works by its own, while still delivering an experience that fans would expect. It's well worth picking up and playing.", "timestamp_created": 1516486634, "timestamp_updated": 1516486634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39529468": {"recommendationid": "39529468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113521753", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 339, "last_played": 1516605887}, "language": "english", "review": "God game", "timestamp_created": 1516605993, "timestamp_updated": 1516605993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39529038": {"recommendationid": "39529038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201877824", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 397, "last_played": 1516602555}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ube0c\uae08\uc740 \uc815\ub9d0 \uc88b\uc558\uace0 \uac8c\uc784\ub3c4 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud004\ub9ac\ud2f0\uac00 \ub192\uc544\uc9c4 \uac83 \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\ub610\ud55c \uc911\uac04\uc911\uac04\uc5d0 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ub9d0\ud22c\uc640 \uac1c\uadf8\ub4e4\ub85c \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\uc9c4\ud589\uc0c1 \uc870\uae08 \ub354 \uc9c0\ub8e8\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac8c \ub41c\uc810\uc774 \uc88b\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud22c\ub354\ubb38\uc758 \ud6c4\uc720\uc99d\uc774 \ub108\ubb34 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub0a8\uace0 \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 2\ub144\ub3d9\uc548\uc774\ub098 \uae30\ub300\ud558\uace0 \uae30\ub2e4\ub838\ub358 \uc800\ub85c\uc368\ub294 \uc870\uae08 \uc544\uc26c\uc6b8\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub974\uaca0\ub124\uc694. \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc88b\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc Finding Paradise\uc5d0\ub294 \ud22c\ub354\ubb38\uc758 \ub9ac\ubc84\uc640 \uac19\uc774 \uc815\ub9d0 \ud070 \uc784\ud399\ud2b8\ub97c \uc8fc\ub294 \uc778\ubb3c\uc774 \uc5c6\uc5c8\ub2e4\uace0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucc98\uc74c\uc5d0 \uc18c\ud53c\uc544\uc640 \ud398\uc774\uac00 \ub418\ub3cc\uc544\uac00\uba74\uc11c \ub098\uc624\ub358\uac83\uc5d0 \uc0dd\uac01\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc5b4\ub9ac\ub465\uc808\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ub450 \uc778\ubb3c\uc774 \ubc88\uac08\uc544\uac00\uba74\uc11c \ub098\uc624\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub85c \uc0dd\uac01\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud070 \ucda9\uaca9\uc744 \uc8fc\ub294 \uc778\ubb3c\uc774 \uc5c6\uc5c8\ub358 \uac83 \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc774 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\uc758 \uc911\uc694 \uc778\ubb3c\uc774 \ud398\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uc54c\uaca0\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc0dd\uac01\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc544\ub0b4\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc774\uc57c\uae30\ub294 \uc0dd\uac01\ud588\ub358 \uac83\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub9ce\uc774 \ub098\uc624\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uac83 \uac19\uc544\uc11c \uc544\uc27d\uace0, \ub05d\ub0a0\ub54c\ub3c4 '\uc74c \ub05d\ub09c\uac74\uac00..?' \uc544\uace0 \uc870\uae08 \uc5b4\ub9ac\ub465\uc808\ud588\ub358 \ub9c8\uc74c\ub3c4 \uc5c6\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \uc788\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc815\ub9d0 \uc88b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud22c\ub354\ubb38\uc774 \uc6cc\ub099 \ud50c\ub81b\ud3fc\ub4e4\uc744 \ub4a4\ud754\ub4e4\uc5b4\ub193\uc558\ub358 \uc5c4\uccad\ub09c \uac8c\uc784\uc774\uc5c8\uae30\ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc0dd\uac01\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc800\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc0dd\uac01\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \ubd84\ub4e4\uc774 \ub9ce\uc73c\uc2e4\uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\uaca0\ub124\uc694. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc Finding Paradise \ub610\ud55c \uc815\ub9d0 \uac13\uac9c\uc778 \uac83 \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud574\ubcf4\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uc168\ub2e4\uba74 \uadf8\ub798\ub3c4 \uaf2d \ud55c\ubc88\uc740 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud574\ubcf4\uc2dc\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ucd94\ucc9c\ud574\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4:) \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ub2e4\uc74c\uc791\ud488\ub3c4 \uae30\ub300\ud558\uaca0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4!", "timestamp_created": 1516603823, "timestamp_updated": 1516603885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39528335": {"recommendationid": "39528335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198235885456", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 257, "last_played": 1516588794}, "language": "english", "review": "A beautiful story, with an amazing soundtrack.

Mesmo assim, Finding Paradise consegue impressionar e criar algo completamente novo e de alguma maneira t\u00e3o fant\u00e1stico quanto o primeiro jogo da saga.\n\nAgora vou explicar um pouco melhor com spoilers(Se quiserem saber porque demorei mais de 10 horas para completar o jogo, eu estava gravando e tive que traduzir)\n\n\n[spoiler] O in\u00edcio e as primeiras mem\u00f3rias come\u00e7am normalmente, e a mem\u00f3ria do desejo do Colin na Sigmund Corp foi muito interessante. Eu comecei a ficar com certo receio quando o jogo pulou direto para a inf\u00e2ncia do paciente e come\u00e7ou a fazer aquela espiral. No To The Moon os doutores somente voltam nas mem\u00f3rias e acontece uma grande virada com as mem\u00f3rias antigas e os Beta-Blockers e tudo o mais, que acabam explicando v\u00e1rios mist\u00e9rios de uma vez s\u00f3 de maneira fant\u00e1stica [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] Eu n\u00e3o sabia como o Kan Gao ia conseguir fazer um plot twist no meio do jogo daquele jeito, mas ele conseguiu! A Faye tinha sido um personagem misterioso desde o in\u00edcio do jogo e ficou claro que a grande revela\u00e7\u00e3o seria relacionada a ela, e eu estava esperando algo como uma morte tr\u00e1gica(que o jogo menciona como possibilidade), uma mudan\u00e7a para um local distante(que tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 dito v\u00e1rias vezes) ou at\u00e9 mesmo que Sofia e Faye s\u00e3o a mesma pessoa(tem muitos paralelos entre elas!). Mas o que realmente aconteceu realmente era algo que eu nunca teria pensado e foi absolutamente fant\u00e1stico! [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] Ainda por cima, o jogo extrapola sobre isso e mostra que a Faye, esse ser criado pela imagina\u00e7\u00e3o de Colin, era como a pr\u00f3pria Sigmund Corp. Foi ELA que deu a sugest\u00e3o a ele de se tornar piloto de avi\u00e3o, foi ELA que o motivou a tocar violino, ELA deu o empurr\u00e3o para o Colin chamar a Sofia em um encontro, ela \u00e9 o que a Sigmund Corp faz! Mas sem mem\u00f3rias falsas! GENIAL! [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] Como se n\u00e3o bastasse, o jogo termina com a Faye mostrando a Colin que seus arrependimentos n\u00e3o eram realmente ruins, fazendo-o relembrar dos momentos felizes da vida, e ainda tendo uma conversa final com ele em sua varanda, como fizeram da primeira vez que eles se encontraram.

two games, To The Moon and A Bird Story. The story is full of emotion and really makes you feel whats happening in the game. The puzzle adds a sort of \"break\" from the game and gives you a small challenge. You feel close to the characters as if you're actually in there with them yourself. The developers even added some references from other games which was really enjoyable. The soundtrack is one that is easily one of the best soundtracks I've heard in any game and you can hear the amount of time put into making it. Lastly, the small bits of humor really lighten up the game, giving you a good chuckle every once in a while. I'm grateful I found To The Moon so I can fully enjoy the content that is now being made by these creators Amazing job by the devs and we as fans are so very lucky for having you make these incredible games for us.

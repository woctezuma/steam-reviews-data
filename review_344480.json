Oh, I know! This game is glorius.\n\nI remember when I first played this game, which was around the time it came out. I loved it then, and I love it now. Now, the first time I played this, it wasn't on steam, but rather a mobile game. I never thought much about mobile gaming, but quell changed that forever. \n\nThe game stuck with me for years after I played it first. So one day I remember this game. I decide \"I'm gonna see if this game is on Steam now that I'm a big boy.\" But what do I end up finding? I find the game, as well as three sequels which I didn't even know existed. I bought them all without hesitation.\n\nThe game is visually enticing, has fun, interesting and clever gameplay, and a god-tier soundtrack (which is undoubtedly the reason the game is so memorable to me). I don't really know what to say in terms of replayability, but I still love this game all the same. It's a good good game for all types of players, professional or casual. The game has a decent length for what it is, it has responsive controls and several ways to carry out said controls, and really is just a good game all around.\n\nIn short, I adore this game and it is definitely one of my favorites of all time.\n\nOh, the sequels are pretty good too.

New mechanics are introduced once in a while, including wrapping around the edge of the screen, turnable spikes, activated one-way blocks, blocks that dissolve when combined and teleporters. You have to collect all pearls to advance to the next level.\n\nQuell is certainly not ground-breakingly innovative, but it's a solid puzzle game that requires some planning-ahead if you want to achieve perfect scores. While you can't skip levels, there is a built-in system of getting hints and solutions for levels, so you never get stuck or overly frustrated. I'll admit, I used the solver on 3 or 4 of the more complex levels just to spare me the annoyance. You can also always undo moves, which I was quite happy about.\n\nOn the technical side I was very positively surprised. The mobile origins only show in some of the menu interactions. Otherwise you can completely rely on keyboard and use the very sensible hotkeys. You can tell some thought went into the PC version, it's definitely not one of those awful, lazy mobile ports.\n\n~5-6 hours with little replay value, basic graphics, basic puzzle mechanics - it's a decent way to pass your time, but after a dozen levels I usually took a break because I was already bored.

Mechanics-wise, it's easy to do:  move a raindrop left, right, up or down, find a hidden jewel and cross over some number of pearls in the level.  Broadly speaking, most of the maps are interesting, fun, and satisfying.  Unfortunately, some of the maps (and these tend to be in the last era of them) get so complex that it gets frustrating (and I had to resort to walk-throughs).  Of course, this is a puzzle game and, I suppose, puzzles might involve frustration at some point.  More specific issues are:\n\n- The goal of finding the hidden jewels isn't mentioned in the tutorial.  It doesn't even show up as a bulletin at the top of the screen until you've finished several levels (no problem going back and finding them, though).\n- There's a secret level that's so secret there's no Achievement for it or even any indication that it might exist.\n- Because the jewel could be hidden anywhere, finding it is usually much harder than solving the puzzle (i.e., picking up the pearls) and basically involves trying to break every block or activate every green dot you can get to.\n- Those green dots are a pain.  When you traverse them, they expand into a blockage.  That means the puzzle changes shape every time you go over one and could change shape differently depending on which direction you traverse it (because of multiple green dots in a line).  Usually, that's not too bad.  But, there are several puzzles where there are just oodles of green dots and there's just no way to keep it all straight.\n- And, most confusing of all are the walls.  Unless they're blocked, you translate to the opposite wall if you hit one.  The problem is when there are multiple sets of walls:  you're uncertain as to which set of walls you'll translate to.  Again, this is especially bothersome in the final era of maps.\n\nAgain, I am recommending the game.  I got 10.9 hours of usually fun game play out of it and it lists for about $4.  So, it's definitely worth it.  I just wish a couple of the maps hadn't been so frustrating.", "timestamp_created": 1501017192, "timestamp_updated": 1501017373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502841", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33617073": {"recommendationid": "33617073", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047972163", "num_games_owned": 332, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500327669}, "language": "english", "review": "The last puzzel took me around 3 hours to complete. \nOnly two puzzels were frustrating.

Das ist nat\u00fcrlich auch Geschmackssache.\n\nMir gef\u00e4llt die Spielidee sehr gut. Die Idee ist eine Variante des Brettspiels Rasende Roboter. Man muss (m\u00f6glichst in so wenig Z\u00fcgen wie m\u00f6glich) mit seiner Figur (hier ein wundersch\u00f6n animierter Wassertropfen) gewisse Felder auf dem Spielfeld erreichen.\n\nDie ersten (bei mir so ca. 40) Level sind ziemlich einfach (etwas zu einfach). Dann wird es langsam schwieriger, so dass es zumindest manchmal nicht einfach wird, nur die minimale Anzahl an Z\u00fcgen zu ben\u00f6tigen. Einige Level finde ich durchaus anspruchsvoll, besonders wenn man sie perfekt l\u00f6sen will. Es bleiben mir also noch ein paar N\u00fcsse zu knacken.\n\nMan kann auch Level \u00fcberspingen oder sich Hinweise geben lassen. Ich habe es (noch) nicht genutzt, aber es ist ja gut, wenn es so etwas gibt.\n\nIch fand das Leveldesign sehr gelungen. Jeder Level war deutlich anders und so kam keine Langeweile auf.\n\nDie Steuerung ist komfortabel mit Undo- und Reset-Funktion. Man kann genausogut mit Controller wie mit Tastatur und Maus steuern.\n\nDie Grafik ist sehr sch\u00f6n und stilvoll. Die fern\u00f6stlich meditativ angehauchte Musik ist angemessen und lenkt nicht ab.\n\nPro & Contra:\n\n+ Sehr sch\u00f6ne, simple aber unterhaltsame Spielidee\n+ Einige anspruchsvolle Level\n+

For such an unassuming concept, the mechanics are superly executed and the different block types add a fun level of variety and challenge. What's particularly nice is that each level has a few challenges: Not only is it about solving it, but you can also do so in a 'perfect' number of moves. Additionally, every level has a jewel hidden within it (normally behind a block) which you have to go out of your way to find. It's a nice mix that gives you plenty to do. The levels are challenging but not brutal, and you're not punished for mistakes or time. All in all, it makes for a very relaxing, but enjoyable game to hop in and out of.\n\nOnly thing I'd say: Definitely play this Quell game first. If you've cut your teeth on the sequels, then you'll likely find you blast through most of it a bit too quickly (the last few shelves are still nice and tricky though).", "timestamp_created": 1471785824, "timestamp_updated": 1491149147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24912123": {"recommendationid": "24912123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306473582", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471183768}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5168\u6210\u5c31\u8fbe\u6210\uff08\u5927\u6982\u67096\u30017\u5173\u662f\u9760\u63d0\u793a\u8fc7\u7684\u2026\u2026\uff09\n\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u89e3\u8c1c\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6bcf\u5173\u6709\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u7ebf\u5403\u6389\u6240\u6709\u73cd\u73e0\u548c\u627e\u5230\u9690\u85cf\u5b9d\u77f3\u4e24\u4e2a\u8c1c\u9898\u3002\n\u7f3a\u70b9\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u73a9\u592a\u591a\u5173\u4f1a\u5ba1\u7f8e\u75b2\u52b3\u2026\u2026\n\nPS\uff1a\u867d\u7136\u5546\u5e97\u754c\u9762\u6ca1\u5199\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u81ea\u5e26\u5b98\u65b9\u4e2d\u6587\u7684\u3002\uff08\u4f46\u597d\u50cf\u662f\u673a\u7ffb\uff0c\u300c\u9000\u51fa\u6e38\u620f\u300d\uff08\u300cExit\u300d\uff09\u88ab\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210\u300c\u51fa\u53e3\u300d\u4e86\uff09", "timestamp_created": 1471183979, "timestamp_updated": 1471184106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24882959": {"recommendationid": "24882959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043036686", "num_games_owned": 1143, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471090572}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting puzzle game with simple controls and mechanics.

levels quickly, you can do that, you can even use coins you collect to unlock levels apart from the very next one, but you can also go for the least possible moves for extra challenge, satisfaction and coins, and try to find the jewel hidden on each level.\n\nthere are only 3 minor things I can hold against it: you can't rebind the controls (it plays fine with the keyboard but I would've preferred undo on backspace instead of 'u'), the stage select screen is not very informative, too much clicking/waiting to see which levels aren't perfect or have jewels left to find, and finally the story. there's supposed to be one, it's probably about war and love and whatnot, but it's so subtle it practically doesn't exist. not a huge deal for a puzzle game though.\n\nall in all, great stuff,

In higher levels there are added some elements like poisoned orbs, spikes or portals. You can also get stuck in infinite loops. Each level contains a hidden jewel you must find in a second playthrough. The controls are sometimes buggy viewing the game is made for touchpad but it uses mouse pointer swipe instead of arrow keys. So you can accidently do a double move.\n\nQuell Part1 is a good introduction into the series.

Desenvolvido pela  Fallen Tree Games Ltd do qual j\u00e1 tem \u00f3timos games em seu curr\u00edculo, a trilogia Quell j\u00e1 virou um dos meus jogos Puzzle prediletos e isso porque ele tem tudo o qu\u00ea eu procuro em um jogo Puzzle: Simplicidade.\n\nQuell \u00e9 o primeiro jogo da trilogia que contem os seguintes jogos: Quell Memento, Quell Reflect. Eu estou jogando o primeiro t\u00edtulo e me divertindo muito. \u00c9 um jogo que coloca o jogador pra pensar, mas sem ser algo punitivo ou demasiado complexo. Admito que fiquei preso at\u00e9 o momento em 1 ou 2 puzzles, mas nada que acabe frustrando o jogador j\u00e1 que o jogo te da dicas caso voc\u00ea realmente fique preso em determinado puzzle. Isso facilita aquele jogador mais irritado com jogos e que n\u00e3o quer ficar quebrando a cabe\u00e7a por longos minutos at\u00e9 resolver determinado Puzzle. Em geral Quell \u00e9 um jogo equilibrado j\u00e1 que 90% dos Puzzles s\u00e3o de dificuldade mediana, sendo que o jogador vai encontrar um ou outro com uma dificuldade mais acentuada. Ou seja, \u00e9 o t\u00edtulo perfeito para iniciantes no mundo Puzzle e at\u00e9 mesmo veteranos que procuram um jogo deste estilo.\n\nQuell tem uma trilha sonora bel\u00edssima e uma arte incr\u00edvel. Eu diria que s\u00e3o seus pontos de destaque j\u00e1 que no jogo tudo funciona em perfeita harmonia. O cen\u00e1rio \u00e9 bem constru\u00eddo e a trilha sonora \u00e9 extremamente relaxante. Ou seja, voc\u00ea pode apreciar o jogo com calma, mesclando com aquele outro t\u00edtulo mais fren\u00e9tico que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 jogando na sua Steam. Perfeito para os momentos de procastina\u00e7\u00e3o, inclusive.\n\nO objetivo de Quell \u00e9 guiar uma bola de \u00e1gua (pelo teclado) a coletar objetos pelo cen\u00e1rio em uma determinada quantia de movimentos que s\u00e3o contados na tela. Voc\u00ea coletando todas as pequenas esferas do cen\u00e1rio, voc\u00ea termina aquele Puzzle e vai para o pr\u00f3ximo. \u00c9 claro que tem objetivos extras como por exemplo: Pegar pedras (diamantes) escondidos pelo cen\u00e1rio, concluir o puzzle com o menor n\u00famero poss\u00edvel de movimentos, desviar de espinhos, pegar portais que levam a outra parte do cen\u00e1rio e mais outras coisas que deixam o jogo um pouco mais complexo, mas sem se tornar frustrante para o jogador e sim tornando ele ainda mais divertido. As conquistas de Quell s\u00e3o absurdamente faceis de conseguir, \u00e9 claro ... se voc\u00ea quiser respeitar determinados tipos de regras dentro do jogo, como por exemplo: Terminar o puzzle com uma determinada quantidade de movimentos. Mas nada \u00e9 muito complexo j\u00e1 que se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o tiver paci\u00eancia \u00e9 s\u00f3 usar as dicas e voc\u00ea consegue concluir todos os n\u00edveis no modo \"perfeito\". Tudo no jogo at\u00e9 o determinado momento desta an\u00e1lise funciona de maneira exemplar e din\u00e2mica. Os puzzles tem dificuldade ajustada, o cen\u00e1rio \u00e9 belo, a trilha sonora \u00e9 relaxante e as conquistas s\u00e3o bem faceis de se conseguir. Quer mais? O jogo conta com o idioma Portugu\u00eas e com uma jogabilidade suave e descomplicada.\n\nAlgumas recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es: Compre a trilogia! eu paguei 3,99 na sale de inverno e obtive a trilogia. \u00c9 claro que se voc\u00ea jogador for comprar fora da fale vai pagar muito mais caro e n\u00e3o sei se valeria a pena j\u00e1 que acredito se tratar de um jogo bem curto. Mas \u00e9 claro, isso depende de pessoa pra pessoa. Eu como paguei barato nos 3 jogos, estou mais do que satisfeito.\n\nQuell oferece tudo que um jogador de Puzzle iniciante ou expert procura: Boa dose de dificuldade, arte magn\u00edfica, trilha sonora relaxante e todinho em Portugu\u00eas. Apesar de Quell n\u00e3o oferecer um enredo, isso n\u00e3o diminui a qualidade deste incr\u00edvel t\u00edtulo independente que pode rodar em qualquer computador e que oferece horas de divers\u00e3o!\n\nEu recomendo, Quell.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1451785947, "timestamp_updated": 1451785947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20229469": {"recommendationid": "20229469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064050389", "num_games_owned": 3713, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455844003}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is sometimes challenging but the music and graphics are relaxing and peaceful.  I've seen other similar games but with just basic graphics that are blah.  This game is what a puzzle game should be:  a complete package of good gameplay, graphics and music.  There's no story, but I don't expect that from a puzzle game.\n\nHow to Play:\n\nUse your mouse or the arrow keys to move a blue sphere through a maze to collect all the pearls.  Once you choose a direction the sphere keep going until it bumps into something.  Avoid spikes (obviously!), use warp rings (look like sonic rings) and you can even move off the screen and appear at the opposite side!  Though sometimes that leads to endless loop if there is nothing to bump against.\n\nMusic:\n\nSoft, peaceful background music that does not intrude on your thought but is just nicely in the background.  Perfect for this game.\n\nGraphics:\n\nYou are in a quaint house with lots of brown, beige and neutral colors.  The level select is a bookcase.  When you go to play a level it goes to the window.   I'm very impressed with how much these little details add to the game to make it complete.  It's not \"just\" a puzzle game, it's a peaceful experience.\n\nThere is no timer (yay!).  You can take as many moves as you like to finish a level, but they do say what the least amount of moves is for each level and you can replay to try for that goal.  \n\nThere are achievements for those who like to collect 100%.  I have not finished the game, so I can't tell you if they are all easy to get or some really difficult.

Starts out really simple and stays pretty simple until the last two years. I never really got stumped or had my brain hurt from the difficulty, but for $1 an hour this game is easily worth the puzzles. You can see the gameplay in the trailer, so no elaboration needed.\n\nDon't understand the necessity of the jewels/gems. There hidden in blocks (usually) that you have to ram your ball in to to get, which is usually out of the way of the objective. I don't really enjoy just redoing the levels to find the random gems by smashing random blocks until i find the one that the gem is in, which is why I just checked the guide to find the damn things after a while. How is it a puzzle if I have to blindly ram blocks? That's just stupid.\n\nThe graphics are nice too, but not really necessary for a puzzle game. This could have been accomplished with a 2D black and white game and would have been just as enjoyable. I didn't listen to the music so if you really care about the music of your puzzle games, check some of the other reviews.\n\nGive this a go if you like puzzles, you most likely won't be disappointed.

The game then slowly adds more rules and mechanics to add to the challenge.\n\nThis is a game that is definitely worth it any price tag, and I would recommend you pick it up today. Even if you\u2019re not normally into puzzle games, you may be surprised how much you will enjoy Quell.\nFrom its artwork, to its music, to the pure level of polish this game has, it is by far one of the best puzzle games available.\n\nIf you\u2019ve played Quell and liked it, check out the two sequel games: Quell Reflect, and Quell Memento, which add even more new mechanics and put a fun twist on an already awesome game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1431625191, "timestamp_updated": 1431625191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.725988", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15827404": {"recommendationid": "15827404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004701858", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431622957}, "language": "english", "review": "Good stuff.", "timestamp_created": 1431622997, "timestamp_updated": 1431622997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437645", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15826911": {"recommendationid": "15826911", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997175499", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434060091}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay, I love this after about 30 seconds.  yum", "timestamp_created": 1431620926, "timestamp_updated": 1431620926, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.385479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39416768": {"recommendationid": "39416768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058584412", "num_games_owned": 7377, "num_reviews": 180, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 71, "last_played": 1515812515}, "language": "english", "review": "A very fun puzzler.

Man muss sich vorher also genau \u00fcberlegen, welchen Weg man mit dem Tropfen am besten w\u00e4hlt. Da nach und nach neue Hindernisse dazu kommen, wird das Spiel zunehmend schwieriger, bleibt aber bei einer gewissen Verbissenheit bew\u00e4ltigbar. Man kann zwar durch eine falsche Bewegung ein Level unl\u00f6sbar machen, aber fairerweise wird man jedes Mal darauf hingewiesen, wenn man etwas unwiderruflich verbockt hat, und kann das Level neu starten. So lernt man schlie\u00dflich auch dazu. \nDie Grafik und die Musik von Quell gefallen mir nicht besonders, und da es andere Spiele gibt, in die ich meine Lebenszeit noch lieber investiere, werde ich Quell vermutlich nicht zu Ende zocken.

I can honestly say I am enjoying it all over again. \n\nOne negative thing which I must add, is why they chose to remove the story from this version? If I am not mistaken, the mobile game told a narrative as you unlocked new stages. This seems to be just the puzzles. This obviously has no impact on the game overall, but still, I do remember enjoying the words of the old man as they usually pertained to the puzzes themselves.\n\nAnyway, for a simple puzzle you can just play to unwind or destress, this is definitely it.

Grosso modo, je suis ultra fan de jeux de canap\u00e9 \u00e0 faire entre potes en buvant des bi\u00e8res, et jusqu'ici, c'est mon favori :\n- Hidden in Plain Sight, bien qu'assez r\u00e9p\u00e9titif et n'ayant que 2 modes vraiment int\u00e9ressants (et encore, en dehors de la chasse aux pi\u00e8ces), arrive \u00e0 foutre une tension assez incroyable. Mais il lasse vite et on est clairement sur des sessions de 5 \u00e0 15 minutes max.\n- Nidhogg est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant au d\u00e9but, mais une fois qu'on a compris comment gagner (\u00e0 savoir courir comme un sac sans se faire rattraper et en sautant au bon moment pour pas se faire avoir par le lancer d'\u00e9p\u00e9e), le jeu perd pas mal de son int\u00e9r\u00eat. Mais il m'a occup\u00e9 quelques dizaines d'heures, donc je valide.\n- Towerfall est fort sympa, il me semble que c'est le jeu qui m'a fait tomb\u00e9 dans cette cat\u00e9gorie de jeux de versus. J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 extra fan au d\u00e9but, les couleurs sont chatoyantes, le gameplay tr\u00e8s cool, les maps vari\u00e9es. Mais h\u00e9las au bout d'un moment (et je dirais surtout une fois que j'ai d\u00e9couvert Samurai Gunn), c'est devenu chiant et trop \"luck\" \u00e0 mon go\u00fbt. N\u00e9anmoins, j'ai le souvenir de tr\u00e8s belles actions qui furent l'occasion de s'insulter copieusement mais qui restent n\u00e9anmoins m\u00e9morable, donc on reste dans du top tier. Un jeu tr\u00e8s recommandable, dans le haut du panier.\n- Lethal League, qui est tr\u00e8s cool, autant dans l'ambiance que le gameplay. Je l'aime beaucoup, et le sensation de vitesse et de puissance est tr\u00e8s bien retranscrire, mais je le trouve tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser, et m\u00eame apr\u00e8s des dizaines d'heures je ne dirais pas que je ma\u00eetrise les subtilit\u00e9s de chaque perso. Et le fait que les persos soient diff\u00e9rents fait qu'il est forc\u00e9ment moins \u00e9quilibr\u00e9, ce qui le rapproche d'un jeu de baston standard, ce qui est autant une qualit\u00e9 qu'un reproche.\n- Et d'autres que j'ai achet\u00e9s mais pas encore test\u00e9s (Awesomenauts, Dwarven brawl Bros...),mais j'updaterai p't'\u00eatre ma review d'ici l\u00e0.\n\nBref. Plus s\u00e9rieusement, autant Towerfall m'a (relativement) vite saoul\u00e9 \u00e0 cause du param\u00e8tre chance un peu trop \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e0 mon go\u00fbt (m\u00eame si le param\u00e9trage tr\u00e8s fin niveau options est un gros plus), autant l\u00e0 on est sur 99% de skill avec des contr\u00f4les extr\u00eamement simples : j'ai jamais trop accroch\u00e9 aux jeux de baston habituels qui demandent quelques heures d'apprentissage, l\u00e0 tu prends n'importe quel connard qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 touch\u00e9 une manette, en 20 minutes il peut commencer \u00e0 coller des branl\u00e9es. Je vous garantis que s'il m'arrive de perdre \u00e0 Towerfall contre des noobs/d\u00e9butants pas trop nuls alors que j'ai 50h dessus, pour me coller une branl\u00e9e \u00e0 Samurai Gunn, le mec a int\u00e9r\u00eat d'\u00eatre une putain de b\u00eate (ou moi \u00eatre sacr\u00e9ment bourr\u00e9).\n\nDonc est-ce qu'il vaut 15\u20ac ?

The game mashes up some of my favorite things, and owns them completely. It\u2019s the awesome lovechild of Mario Bros Arcade and Samurai Champloo, that went to Super Smash Bros High, and is currently attending indie art school and \u201cgetting to know itself.\u201d\n\nThe premise of the game is easy enough to explain. Players choose an 8 bit samurai, and prepare themselves for battle. The character selection screen gives you a small area to try out controls in while other participants lock in their selections. The control scheme is simple, yet will take time and practice to master. Players can slash in cardinal directions with a sword, fire a gun (up to 3 times per life) and jump with good air control. Wall sliding and wall jumping are also present, as they should be in any good little personal melee combat title. You can even \u201cfeign death\u201d if you lack honor, by crouching/lying on the ground.\n\nCombat takes place in 1 of 4 selectable worlds, each with their own theme and unique obstacles. Forest levels, for instance, showcase bamboo that grows and changes as the match progresses, while the Mountain features hanging icicles that can be dropped to create level playing fields or slay foes. Each of the 4 settings features about 10 individual combat screens. A level is encompassed by the screen in its entirety, features pacman/mario bros arcade style level wrap, and have 4 entryways through which new players (or ninja) may enter the battlefield.\n\nSounds simple, doesn\u2019t it? And it is, truly, until you play it. There is so much to manage in such a short period once bullets are flying and katana are drawn. Death can, and will, come from anywhere. Skilled players can be seen as those who measure their sword strikes, as their is a minor cooldown (less than a second) between strikes, and striking too soon normally means the death of the impatient warrior. One would think that the guns would completely alter the balance, and they do, but not as much as you might think. While they can kill from a distance, your shots are limited to 3 per life, guns won\u2019t function at all if they get wet (yes, there are water hazards), and, most importantly, you can deflect bullets with a well timed sword strike.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that you will never use your gun; it may just be in ways that you are not used to. Canny players often fire bullets in the short to medium range to avoid deflections. These shots are often after after a close strike, and will follow rule #2 \u2013 Doubletap. One more makes 100% sure. You might die from a deflection, but you will likely take the other warrior down. Those who have truly mastered guns often send bullets via screen wrap to take down unsuspecting opponents.\n\nThe game is beautifully rendered in 8 bit, with characters sporting multiple color schemes and great animations. Charm positively oozes from these samurai sprites. I remember the first time I got my gun wet and tried to fire it in combat, just to see little sputters of water leave my firearm. Time has been spent, and it shows.\n\nAnd the music! This is where the Samurai Champloo influence might show its roots. Composed by Doseone, the SG EP features tracks emulating traditional sounding bases mixed with hip hop elements. The audio accompaniment really completes the package. Nujabes (R.I.P.) would be proud, I think.\n\nSamurai Gunn is one of those rare treats one has to savor. Specifically, in close quarters with friends. It sports 4 modes, 3 of which require other players\u2026. on your couch. That\u2019s right, there is no online. I know, I KNOW! Blaspheme! you say. But realistically, this game was designed to be played within arm-punching distance of your opponent. It\u2019s tense, its fun, and most likely everyone will break out their warcry. Tables might get flipped. All in good fun, with smiles.\n\nNext time you are looking for a fun party game, consider Samurai Gunn.

Let me expand on that:\n-You run\n-You jump \n-You can jump off walls\n-You swing a sword in one of 4 directions (up, down, left, right)\n-You shoot your gun (with limited ammo) in 4 directions as well\n-You can deflect bullets back in the direction it came at by swinging your sword at it\n-Clashing swords with another combatant causes one or both of you to fly backwards and take no damage\n-One hit kills\n-First to 10 kills in multiplayer\n-Killing yourself loses a point\n-When you share a similar score with the winner, you may go to a 1v1 showdown\n-There is some destructable terrain\n-There are spikes of deathy death and squishy death squishes by moving platforms and icicles\n-The maps are circular, meaning when you drop from the bottom you will come out the top. From the left edge of the screen to the right.\n\nThat's really about it.\n\nI highly recommend having CONTROLLERS for this game.

It's fun, addictive and really easy to get into.\n\nSamurai Gunn is an extremely fast-paced arena combat game in which players use a katana as their main weapon and may fire up to three shots from a gun as a support weapon. The gameplay relies on players' abilities to quickly move around the levels my means of running, jumping and executing their opponents in one lightning-fast strike. Shots from guns may be used to cover long distances in a straight line, but may also be deflected at the shooter by parrying them with one swing of the sword. Additionally, levels often include environmental hazards such as spikes and moving platforms which can squish any character against a wall, floor or ceiling.\n\nAn impressive amount of attention to detail is revealed through such things as bullet casings falling to the ground after each shot. What's more, the casings remain there and may be pushed by any character who steps on them. Another example is the water: if someone dies in a pond, the water acquires a red tint which becomes more intense as more blood is spilled, only to be washed away after a few seconds of no blood-spilling on the same spot. To top it all off, standing in water renders your gun useless even when when you get out of the pond, so keep that in mind.\n\nThe soundtrack is a perfect match for the action. Based on traditional Japanese instruments, it's reminiscent of soundtracks from chanbara movies and animes with a historical setting. At times, it reminds me of Samurai Spirits, only faster-paced (depending on the track). On that note, the sound effects are hugely satisfying. Most of all, the katanas cutting through the air (or your enemies, ideally). There's something about that loud metallic *schwing!* that makes you want to keep pressing the sword button for more, even if you're not hitting anyone.\n\nGraphically, it's a beautiful game. The sprites are simple but perfectly distinguishable from one another and each is full of personality. There are three characters for each faction and, even within such simplicity, all of them can be told apart at a glance while keeping a common element that identifies them as belonging to the same group. The levels offer a rather wide variety of colours and designs. The intense lime green and clear brown of the bamboo forests, the purple rocks and pale green bushes of the mountain pass with its Buddha statues or the white snow, dark trees and clear water of the winter areas are all pleasant to look at and brimming with detail. Each gives the battle a particular mood or atmospheric feeling. And yet, they managed to do all this with no real distractions for the player, thanks to its retro-style pixellated graphics. Combining an old visual style with modern-day gameplay fluency is a path that numerous indie developres take, and it was yet again the right choice for this title.\n\nAll of it is wrapped up into an elegant presentation that fans of chanbara films and samurai pop culture in general will recognise and love. From the moment we see the title screen, we know what type of world we'll be thrown into. A red band with black silhouettes belonging to a bunch of samurais running through a field is an extremely effective introduction to a high-paced game such as this one and it also serves the purpose of creating a classy main menu. In-game, the brief stop produced by a kill, with the blackening of the screen save for the strip which shows killer and victim, is a charmingly abrupt way of making everyone aware of the death. The slow-motion plus zoom that frames the final kill in a fight always provides for an interesting composition and flaunts the game's colourful palette as well as its sprites, still lovely and worth of appreciation with their pixels brought to a bigger size. The menus are simple and use one font, and the signs which recount the kills at the end of a match have a neat parchment feel to them, with easily recognisable icons depicting each death and its cause.\n\nI recommend obtaining this underappreciated gem while it's on sale, since playing it with friends is the best way to exploit its wonders. Survival mode is fun, engaging and addictive, but nothing beats the variety and unpredictability (or lack thereof) of playing against human competitors.

If two Ninjas go for the jugular at the same instant, a parry(or clash, according to the guide) ensues, prolonging the gory conflict.\n\nguns, as well as swords, can be used, and the three-bullet limit makes for some interesting situations. water will reduce your mighty blunderbuss to a mere squirtgun, an original concept.\n\nThe Mysterious 'Sword Sheath' move always puzzled me, until I cheated and read up on it. It seems a good idea to be able to change your sword stroke, but I can't see any difference between over or under hand.\n\nActually, the most important aspect of the sword is it's ability to add an acceleration,(In the direction of the slash) to your fighter. The Jump button increases the duration of the added momentum, allowing for some incredible near-flying combat.\n\nOne last interesting thing about sword-clashes: The Samurai who drew sword slower will be sent flying back, unable to pull out his blade until he slows down. obviously, this means that if you follow up quickly, you can finish an opponent who defended your first attack. A less obvious application of this is that on certain levels you can send an opponent plummetting to his spiky doom.\n\nWhich brings me to the level design part. Much like other games made by the same designer, levels are divided into areas. Samurai Gunn has four areas, with each area having it's own six or so levels.\n\nThe 'Fortress' area is well done, complete with moving platforms and pits of spikes. purple-pink roofing and tan timber give it a very solid asthetic. The 'Forest' area too, is very well made, green and brown, with terrain that breaks up into spike traps.\n\nHowever, The Cemetery and Mountain levels seem unfitting. Each one has it's own cool little things, but not enough to make them equal to the Fortress and Forest areas. Cemetery in particular, with it's 'mushroom/cloud/sticky-things' and drab grey - purple artstyle, doesn't match with the bold color scheme of Samurai Gunn.\n\nThe Mountain area has solid level design, but just doesn't stand up to Fortress/Forest. \n\nAnd now for Survival mode, most hated by fans.(That's the impression I got, anyway) \nSo, you pick a level and battle waves and waves(I think it's without limit by the time you hit Lv.5) of Shadow-Ninjas. It's actually really fun. Except for one thing: The Ai is well... artifical. I myself was impressed by how the Ai behaved, but certain things about them are very irritating.\n\nWhen it comes to conflicts involving multiple attacks and movements in a short period of time and a small area, the Ai is truly pathetic, lacking the ability to see what a human would perceive as being obvious. But, when it comes to reacting to incoming sword or bullet, their reaction is instantaneous, nay, pre-cognitive. If they're lined up on level with an incoming bullet, and aren't somehow disabled, they will reflect it perfectly, every time. I am not exaggerating.\n\nNow to end my long-winded review: here is my final summation of the game:\n\nMechanics: great\nLevel Design: Mostly great, you probably won't play the Cemetery or mountain levels much, especially after you discover Pull.\nArt: great: The Dev is a master of color schemes. \nmodes: Pretty awesome, could use a few more and some work.\n\nall round: 5/5\n\n\nPost script: My ramblings on what I would do if I were the developer of SG.(I can dream)\n\nCharacters: customisation of colors, additions of special appearance modifiers for achievments\n                  (e.g. a black katana if you make it to level 5 of survival, Arrows instead of bullets if\n                  you make five reflection kills in survival, etcetera)\n\nMaps:         Cemetery and Mountain combined into one, get rid of the sticky clouds, make a new \n                  area.( like shore, or dojo, or something )\n\nCemetery Showdown: A really cool idea, but the change of map means that players have to\n                  adapt to another level. If the showdown took place on the same level of the battle,\n                  then the muscle memory would better allow for the players to find each other, invisible\n                  as they are.\n\nGame Modes: Tournament mode. Seriously. SG was designed for this. And, in only four player battles,\n                  you could have the playoff matches fought at the same time, on a map divided down the\n                  middle, or something. For more than four, a plain old tourney mode would work great.\n\n                  Clan mode: A story mode, where you fight in a huge tournament, Hayao V. Kurosawa, \n                  Kubuki V. Hirushagebleghblegh, etc. interspersed with special challenges and stuff.\n\n                  Survival: the Shadow Ninjas seem kinda vanilla. I'd change up their appearence and add\n                  specialized Ai types.(see Ai...) Also, I'd add challenge levels between each round of\n                  survival.(like a showdown)\n\nAi:              Work on making them more human-like, and making them more individually skilled. like a \n                  gunner type, and a berserker, and a turtle...\n\nSpawning:  I'd add spawn points in spikes. That would make things interesting, especially on pull, and \n                  help protect from spawn-kills.(the quickest way to win, btw.)\n\nBushido:    Add a bonus for following Bushido.(no spawn kills, no hiding, no three-shots-in-one-second, and \n                 you always re-sheath your sword after each slash.) like an additional 15% at least 1, rounding up.\n\nClans:        Make each clan have it's own special advantage( Hayao jumps highest, Kubuki Shoots quickest, \n                 Kurosawa Wins in a parry, etcetera) or make the three characters each belong to a class of fighter.\n                 (fast, jump, slash)  \n             \nBut, these are just Ideas. I'd beware of what might happen to the existing mechanics if these were implemented, and only\ndo so If I were sure that they would improve the game.", "timestamp_created": 1392836706, "timestamp_updated": 1392836706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9176228": {"recommendationid": "9176228", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970501943", "num_games_owned": 526, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393136006}, "language": "english", "review": "Currently some of the best couch versus gaming to be had.

Spent hours and hours and hours playing this with people. It's probably one of the easiest pickup-'n-play fighting games on Windows and really gets everyone going. I definitely think this was my game of 2013. I've spent far more time playing it with guests than any other game I own since I bought it on Christmas.\n\nBecause there's absolutely no documentation, there's a lot of learning in terms of moves and rules. For instance, if you press your sword and jump and a direction at the same time, you do a mightier jump in that direction than normal. Also, you're limited to 3 bullets a life (gets rid of bullet sniping or camping), and you can hold down to play dead (you'll die in water if you do this). There are a bunch of stages all with their own little intricacies. If there's any game I'd recommend for party play on Steam, this is it.\n\nI'm using Logitech F710 controllers because they have an amazing d-pad for this kinda stuff.

The premise is fantastically simple- You have a sword you can swing, and a gun you can shoot. Kill the other players- But the strategies build in complexity pretty quickly if you're playing with three or four people.\n\nWithin seconds, you can shoot at one enemy to your right as someone drops down above you. They go to slash, but you intercept with your sword, flinging them back up. At this point, the bullet you shot gets reflected back at you, so you jump over it and towards the guy that dropped down, swinging your sword as you jump. This propells you up into him, netting you a clean kill. But at this moment, the fourth player wraps around from the left side of the screen and shoots you. You barely just landed, and only have enough time to deflect the bullet with your sword, but the guy is already in the air, jumping over the reflected shot, bringing his sword down on you.\n\nThis takes about three or four seconds, and the default mode is 10 kills to win. If someone has at least 9 by this point, it'll enter a showdown between the victor and the close second. These arenas change depending on the stage: One can have a rain of arrows to deflect and dodge, while another turns you both invisible. The variety is fantastic.\n\nThere IS a singleplayer mode, but it's merely just a gauntlet, pitting you against waves of enemies. It's fun for a bit, but starts getting kinda monotonous.

The single player is good fun, the AI can be kind of derpy however but it is good. The multiplayer is obviously where the game becomes brilliant, unfortunately it is only local multiplayer. Although I would love to play with my friends without having them here I do feel that the fun level would decrease, in short, its much better when your friends are within punching distance. I do wish that the different character had different weapons or moves, maybe some designed for ranged more then melee and vice versa.

Take the samurai films of old, ramp it up to eleven with the Tarantino-style violence and blood, and then imbue that with the lightning-fast white-knuckle pace of Hotline Miami, and that's Samurai Gunn in a nutshell\n\nChoose a samurai, choose an arena, and then fight. One hit kills. Armed with only your blade, your handful of bullets, and your agility, you must survive against increasingly challenging waves of enemies in increasingly complex arenas. Like Hotline Miami, death comes fast and at a moment's notice; a single lapse in timing, in reaction and reflex, and your blood will stain the ground rather than your opponent's.\n\nThere are no power-ups to equip, no special swords to unlock, or abilities to use. You and your foes are equally matched; superior skill and reflexes are your only advantages. Each battle is one of hair's-breadth dodges over swinging blades, of smart positioning, perfect timing to strike down an enemy in mid air or deflect his bullet back at him. And that's just against one opponent; it only becomes more intense once you're down to one life and three enemies are out for your blood.\n\nIt's not just this frantic dance of death that makes Samurai Gunn so compelling, but the sheer variety of arenas as well. From levels consisting of moving platforms and traps to levels with spike pits and saw blades, to levels made of nothing but easily breakable bamboos so that the layout changes and shrinks as you play, they are numerous and each must be learned and mastered if you wish to succeed.\n\nIt's the little details that round out this impressive package. Fall into a pond and your gun won't fire but instead misfire and discharge spurts of water. Your blood and bodies stay behind, monuments and reminders of your past failures. Play dead among the corpses to confuse your enemy. Slash at your foe at the same time he does, and you'll clash swords and fly apart, leaving a dust trail in your wake.\n\nSo again, I've only played single player, but I can only imagine that multiplayer is even better thanks to human players instead of AI. You can play co-op against bots or fight against each other in Versus mode. As for Samurai Gunn's future, the developer has said he's \"interested in experimenting with different types of enemies, modes, and other things\" so there's only more frenetic bloodshed to come.", "timestamp_created": 1386820354, "timestamp_updated": 1386830472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592558", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8009883": {"recommendationid": "8009883", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970854480", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506110325}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is cracking good fun, I haven't played much local multiplayer yet I have clocked most of my time in survival mode and had a real blast doing so.

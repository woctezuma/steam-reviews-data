Enigmi sempre ben contestualizzati, mai banali ma nemmeno troppo difficili. L'ambientazione cyberpunk ha permesso agli sviluppatori di creare fasi di gameplay ben riuscite che danno freschezza al tipo di gioco, come ad esempio le fasi giocate nel trancenet, una piattaforma internet dove il personaggio entra virtualmente. Men\u00f9 e opzioni ridotte al minimo sindacale.\nSTORIA: Sicuramente un punto forte del gioco, la narrazione si sviluppa tra indagini poliziesche, intrecci di pi\u00f9 personaggi e un contesto cyberpunk molto ben rappresentato. Le tematiche trattate sono fortemente riservate ad un pubblico adulto e non mancano risvolti interessanti. La caratterizzazione dei personaggi \u00e8 costruita bene ed \u00e8 anch'essa pilastro di questo gioco. Longevit\u00e0 che si attesta su buoni livelli, una decina di ore, anche qualcosa in pi\u00f9 se si spulcia per bene il gioco con la sua enorme mole di dialoghi.\nGRAFICA: Pixel art ispirata, bella per gli appassionati di questo stile e del genere cyberpunk. Tecnicamente per\u00f2 non raggiunge produzioni moderne, sempre in pixel art, come ad esempio Thimbleweed Park. Interfaccia in-game non delle pi\u00f9 intuitive.\nAUDIO: Colonna sonora adeguata al genere, fa il suo lavoro senza per\u00f2 rimanere impressa. Doppiaggio in inglese ottimamente recitato che fa la parte da leone e sopperisce a molte delle mancanze grafiche/tecniche.

Es un policial ambientado en un mundo ciberpunk en el que tendremos que investigar una serie de asesinatos perpetuados por un asesino conocido como \u201cMind Jaker\u201d (Roba mentes) y para ello iremos alternando entre Latha una desempleada quien malgasta sus d\u00edas en el ciberespacio al que llaman \u201cTrance\u201d, Regis un poli de la vieja escuela y a Max su joven compa\u00f1era quien si bien utiliza \u201cTrance\u201d respeta los m\u00e9todos de la vieja escuela.\n\nEs recomendable jugar a esta aventura en \u201cEspa\u00f1ol\u201d al menos que se tenga un muy buen nivel de ingles ya que la historia es algo complicada y hay mucha terminolog\u00eda t\u00e9cnica. Si bien no hay una traducci\u00f3n oficial se puede encontrar sin mucha dificultad (explico mas abajo).\n\nEl aspecto gr\u00e1fico nos hace recordar a las aventuras cl\u00e1sicas de la \u00e9poca dorada. La ambientaci\u00f3n esta muy bien lograda, con carteles de ne\u00f3n parpadeantes, pantallas brillantes, grandes edificios, terminales que debemos hackear, personas con implantes cibern\u00e9ticos, etc. \nDe hecho creo que la ambientaci\u00f3n es uno de los puntos fuertes de esta aventura, hasta tal punto que a mi forma de ver han sacrificado profundidad en los personajes principales para dar mas \u201cvida\u201d al entorno o personajes secundarios as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n para centrarse en cuestiones t\u00e9cnicas de la historia.\n\nEl aspecto sonoro es muy bueno, con m\u00fasica agradable de fondo y con voces muy bien actuadas (en ingles) de absolutamente todos los di\u00e1logos.\n\nLa jugabilidad es mas que correcta, los puzzles son bastante simples o mejor dicho \u201cl\u00f3gicos\u201d, salvo una par de cosas algo absurdas al final del juego y solo una \u201cpuerta\u201d que a mi ojos era invisible que me hizo recordar como odiaba cuando era mas joven quedar trabado en una aventura por cuestiones de dise\u00f1o visual mas que por la complejidad de la aventura.\n\nComo contra, que la verdad es bastante subjetivo, podr\u00eda decir:\n- Falta de carisma en los personajes, digamos como que no llegas a encari\u00f1arte si lo comparamos con otras aventuras, incluso de la misma desarrolladora, pero por otro lado han enriquecido la ambientaci\u00f3n y personajes secundarios.\n- La historia un poco desconcertante al principio, mas concretamente en el prologo, pero luego se hace bastante f\u00e1cil de entender.

This truly is a masterpiece that any lover of science fiction or adventure games needs to experience.\n\nI haven't written a review in quite awhile but felt that this game deserved one. I'm an old gamer (in my mid-30s) and I've played a lot of games in my lifetime. Over the years, I've moved away from the Adventure genre but I started my decades long addiction when LucasArts was in its heyday so I've experienced more than my fair share of these type of games. While this is not the typical style of game I get into these days, I had picked up a copy a while back after reading some stellar reviews. Despite the strong recommendations online, I was honestly very surprised with how quickly I became hooked on this game after I finally got around to loading it up. \n\nTechnobabylon is hands down one of the best storylines I've come across in a video game (a scifi plot as grandiose as any William Gibson or Neil Stephenson novel) and as a storytelling device, the adventure style of gameplay is masterfully implemented to deliver a truly compelling narrative. The graphics are by no means cutting edge but do have a sort of retro-style charm that reminds me strongly of the 90s game \"The Dig\". The puzzles are at times challenging but also masterfully intuitive. Never was i forced to consult a walkthrough but a few times I did have to walk away to clear my brain so I could reassess the task at hand. Perhaps even more telling is how amazingly the game pulls you into its world. Technobabylon incorporates a number of advanced sci-fi concepts which are very much incorporated into the puzzles but it delivers these concepts naturally so at no point did I feel like the game broke the 4th wall in order to explain some info necessary to move forward. Lastly worth noting were the multiple \"choose your own adventure\" elements which allowed for divergent paths within storyline. These elements were nothing extraordinary but it did lend the feeling that you were tailoring your own experience based on the subtle choices you made; just another example of the little subtleties that took this game from good to great.\n\nIn summary, this game is one of those gems that grabs a hold of you and doesn't let you go until you have completed it at which point your drive to find out what happens is replaced by a sadness that the story has come to an end. It is quite rare that I experience this feeling with a video game.. as it is more common with a good book that you just can't put down. If you like science fiction storylines, adventure games or just good stories in general, do yourself a favor and pick up this game. 10/10\n\nPros:\n+ One of the best storylines I've come across in 25+ years of gaming\n+ Playable characters are compelling and offer different playing styles which maintains the game tempo\n+ Interface and Inventory interaction are a joy to use (very well implemented)\n+ Puzzles are challenging but logically intuitive\n+ Scifi concepts are naturally delivered in a way that never breaks the immersion\n+ Voice and music audio are very well done\n+ Choose your own adventure elements give you a feeling of control without overdoing it to a point where you feel like you are missing a part of the storyline\n+ Graphics give the game a retro feel that lovers of the old LucasArts games will appreciate\n+ Multiple Endings\n\nCons:\n- Graphics could be fairly classified as outdated and will turn off some gamers\n- Upon completion, will create a vacuum in your life which you will need to fill with more sci-fi storylines", "timestamp_created": 1499439421, "timestamp_updated": 1499440310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33314982": {"recommendationid": "33314982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105445916", "num_games_owned": 701, "num_reviews": 125, "playtime_forever": 685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499395990}, "language": "english", "review": "Going into Technobabylon, I didn't expect much as I'm not a huge point-and-click adventure game fan. However, Technobabylon is a real treat and is worth experiencing for fans of any game genre. I would even go as far to say that Technobabylon surpasses Telltale's best games in terms of ingenuity.\n\nThe game features a rich story in a dystopian future that may feel convoluted in some areas, though any intelligent individual will appreciate the way the plot is carried out. Without spoiling too much, it deals with murder mysteries and a serial killer who can literally steal the minds of his victims - hence his name, the Mindjacker.\n\nIt's full of well-developed characters, intriguing plot twists, and original concepts. The gameplay deals with dialogue-heavy conversations and some challenging puzzles that are incredibly well-designed. In Technobabylon, any items you receive to solve a puzzle make sense in the way they're used.

Soweit ich es beurteilen kann, ist es das erste \"umfangreiche\" Spiel des Entwicklers, welches mich dann auch noch derart gepackt und umgehauen hat, aufgrund der genialen Geschichte, der super ausgearbeiten Charaktere, der durchaus originellen R\u00e4tsel und nicht zuletzt des Cyperpunk Settings. Beim ersten Wurf ein Volltreffer - Respekt, Technocrat, Respekt! Was macht ihr als n\u00e4chstes? :)\n\nDie Geschichte spielt in der Stadt Newton im Jahre 2087. Die Stadt wird Schauplatz mehrerer Verbrechen eines so genannten \"Mindjacker\", der wie der Name schon fast ver\u00e4t, den Verstand und dessen verbunden Erinnerungen seiner Opfer extrahieren und speichern kann.\n\nDer Gesetzesapparat der Stadt wird durch eine adaptive und st\u00e4ndig lernende k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz namens \"Central\" gesteuert und \u00fcberwacht. Central setzt, infolge der Ereignisse, zwei der Protagonisten, die Ermittler Charlie Regis und Max Lao auf den Fall an und beauftragt sie den Verbrecher dingfest zu machen. Welches Motiv der Mindjacker hat bleibt zun\u00e4chst unklar, es stellt sich allerdings ziemlich schnell heraus, dass auch der dritte spielbare Charakter, die von der Realit\u00e4t in die virtuelle Welt fl\u00fcchtende Jugendliche Latha Sesame, eine gr\u00f6\u00dfer Rolle in dem Ganzen spielt.\n\nFazit: Wenn ihr einen bis ins Detail ausget\u00fcftelten Cyberpunk Krimi sucht, der intelligent, spannend und auch humorvoll ist, dann k\u00f6nnt ihr hier bedenkenlos zugreifen. Einige echt coole Plottwists und Szenarien, die auch ethische Fragen aufwerfen, erwarten euch zus\u00e4tzlich.\n\nMinimale, technische Schwachpunkte, wie eine etwas zu geringe Aufl\u00f6sung und die sehr rudiment\u00e4ren grafischen Einstellungsm\u00f6glichkeiten, hat das Spiel leider ebenfalls, mit denen man aber leben kann - hey, es ist auch ein Adventure Spiel eines Indie Entwicklers und kein Triple-A-Shooter ;). Ich hab es letzendlich im Fenstermodus gezockt, das fand ich pers\u00f6nlich angenehmer. Dieses Manko kann bei mir pers\u00f6nlich nicht \u00fcber das exzellente Spielerlebnis hinwegt\u00e4uschen.

You're tasked with investigating a building where a murder might take place in a little while, as predicted by the central AI of the city.\n\nThe controls are intuitive with left-click being action and right-click being \"look at\". You do have an inventory, accessed from the bottom right of the screen, though you never end up carrying too many items. I will say for me that MOST of the puzzles in this game were fairly logical, with the game providing enough context and ideas for you to work out solutions for yourself. It also helped that, on a few occasions, I couldn't leave the scene I was in without solving all the problems so that narrows down where the solutions must be. \n\nThe main puzzled I struggled with involved me having to leave the building i was in to talk to a man who had appeared outside with no indication. The character was not there when I went in the building. Once I had done that, the rest of the puzzles dropped into place.\n\nI enjoyed exploring the world these characters exist in and seeing this particular interpretation of the future.

Me he quedado con ganas de m\u00e1s, pero no porque el juego sea corto, tiene una buena duraci\u00f3n para su g\u00e9nero y dos finales bastante diferentes, ninguno claramente mejor que el otro.\n\nSe trata de una historia Cyberpunk ambientada en una ciudad-estado del futuro, y vamos controlando a tres personajes: dos detectives y una joven adicta a la red. La relaci\u00f3n que los une entre s\u00ed y a una serie de cr\u00edmenes se va desvelando al avanzar la historia.

Adem\u00e1s entre ellos hay representaci\u00f3n de distintos or\u00edgenes \u00e9tnicos y sexualidades, y uno de los personajes principales es, entre muchas otras cosas, una mujer trans, sin que este rasgo la defina. Estas cosas no tienen un peso especial en la trama, simplemente est\u00e1n ah\u00ed.\n\nLos puzles son satisfactorios, que es de lo mejor que se puede decir, tanto por su dise\u00f1o y su, por lo general, equilibrada relaci\u00f3n dificultad/l\u00f3gica, como por el entorno argumental en el que se desarrollan. Hay casos en que tienes distintas opciones para resolver un mismo problema, y a veces lo que elijas repercute en di\u00e1logos o detalles secundarios de cap\u00edtulos posteriores, pero en nada demasiado importante hasta el \u00e1rea del final, en la que una acci\u00f3n decide entre los dos desenlaces.\n\nS\u00e9 que para alguna gente ser\u00e1 un problema la cuesti\u00f3n del idioma, porque es un g\u00e9nero que usa bastante texto y solo est\u00e1 en ingl\u00e9s.

Also the soundtrack is just *perfect* for setting the mood in any scene/area of the game, it compliments it flawlessly.\nI'd very well say this may be one of my favorite games of all time.

This was clearly someone's passion project. Either that or someone's first stab at making something so cohesive and interesting. It was a valiant effort on the creator's part. And I want to stress my appreciation for the talent and effort put into this. Even if I can't really sink my teeth into it personally. From the art to the lore to the voice talent, you can tell that people really labored over this; that much is evident. However, there are some parts missing here. There are some ingredients missing from the soup,\n\nTechnobabylon is a story about a futuristic world that couldn't care less. Cloned babies, overbearing artificial intelligence, zero privacy, escapism, nuclear war, and the ever present looming threat of scarcity masked as abundance. Everything is here and accounted for. What I can give Technobabylon credit for is how it presents its setting. It doesn't bother to bombard you. It gives you clues about this world you're experiencing. And aside from a set of very specific situations, it isn't required that you care at all about this setting. The characters themselves clearly don't. That's a little more believable in my opinion. If we all lived in the dystopia, I'd doubt that anyone would care after so long. That's natural for these characters, and this is shown in game. Kudos.\n\nNow, I'm going to have to take those kudos right back, because for these steps forward, Technobabylon makes some very curious design choices. I know it's the future in all, but this game has a bizarre fixation on fitting in some heavyweight rhetoric in the wrong places. What do I mean? Well, early in the game we learn that one of the major characters underwent a sex change. Wowee. And this is just mentioned in passing. Never comes up. Never adds much to the character other than a moment of, \"uhh.. ok?\" If anything this soured my vision of one of the characters right off the bat. Why would I care about a character's gender? Or past gender? Especially if this point was treated with none of the tact and meaning that a subject like this usually requires.\n\nLater in the game we're introduced to a homosexual couple who have a synthetic housemaid who's strongly implied to be assisting them in the bedroom. Did I say strongly implied? I mean outright stated. Now, that's fantastic and all, but this is just dropped and left to sit there. The most we know about them is they like Paris. That's about it... Again, no investment. No meaning whatsoever. Strike two. The last straw came late in the game when I witnessed the fastest devolution of what could've been mildly entertaining dialogue into what was essentially akin to \"mind your pronouns.\" Apparently the distinction between gynoid and android is very important? Also, points for me reacting almost exactly like the villain did.\n\nContrast this with the only straight relationship in the game: Regis and his wife. This relationship isn't impactful because its straight, its impactful because it plays a significant role in these character's motivations. It plays into the plot a lot more. It actually contributes. In fact, this point would've remained entirely unchanged if it were a homosexual relationship anyway. I feel like the game tried to make it a point to include these things but ended up making them completely insubstantial as a result.\n\nAs far as the rest of the game goes, I can say everything blends together more or less. It does the setting well, like I said, but failure to utilize this and make something meaningful just leads to more disappointment. The characters are serviceable. So is the plot. It really comes down to how predictable you like your point and click games. I could guess the big twist about two hours before I actually completed the game. And while I'm throwing stones, the last area and the ending are so horribly contrived that it ruins anything the game was trying to set up. Some special thread of voodoo magic is tying these character's fates together. It's up to Regis Philbin and two other people to save the world I guess.\n\nFor what it's worth, this is an alright experience. I wouldn't recommend it for a few reasons. The later half of the game suffers from lack of direction, and it all trails into the worst parts of the game. Puzzles fall into two categories: immediately obvious and impossible. Out of the entire cast, Regis was the only one I was vaguely interested in. The entire rest of the cast was more or less forgettable or boring. And the big top off is the ending. For the asking price, this is an alright game to put some hours into. But honestly, I just don't regard it as exceptional.", "timestamp_created": 1485592331, "timestamp_updated": 1485592331, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439273", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29507070": {"recommendationid": "29507070", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993617581", "num_games_owned": 2409, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485456365}, "language": "english", "review": "Quality Wadjet Eye Games game!

On the other hand, the game itself is only average for a point-and-click adventure. Fortunately, it lets its narrative parts shine through it.\n\n[b]Full version[/b]\n\nBeing a cyberpunk fan, I bought Technobabylon hoping to experience a good cyberpunk story, and in that regard, I was more than satisfied. The game's strongest point is definitely how clever, well thought out and realistic its narrative setting is. Throughout my experience, I kept thinking that if I was transported 50-100 years in the future, I'd be hearing about exactly these issues on the news. I particularly enjoyed how social issues and ethical decisions in technology are at the forefront of this story, in a way that is completely believable. This game is definitely a love letter to the cyberpunk genre by someone who has reflected a lot on it, and that person has my warm thanks for it.\n\nAs a game however, Technobabylon has its share of drawbacks.\n\nIn terms of atmosphere, the art is not so appealing, although the portraits during conversations are really nice. The overall art direction is functional and supports the theme. Voice acting is ok. Music fits, but is not inspiring.\n\nThe story is really great, but would be more appropriate for a book/movie. I find it loses some of its luster here because it's really convoluted. It showcases multiple protagonists, antagonists and secondary characters, goes back and forth between past and present, and jumps from one character's perspective to the next all the time. This could have worked very well if it had been delivered more gradually, but because this story only coalesces at the very end, you spend 80% of the game quite confused by it.\n\nAnd this is made especially a problem because of the difficulty of the puzzles. They are not difficult in the sense of requiring great intellectual feats to solve, but rather in the sense of \"how on earth did they want me to guess I should do this sequence of things to reach this scene's not-even clearly stated objective\". Granted, I consider myself a casual in terms of point-and-click adventures, in the sense that I want the story to unfold with a good flow and the puzzles to be easy and intuitive. This is how I generally felt with Gemini Rue for example, another cyberpunk point-and-click published by Wadjet Eye. But here, in every single scene, I found myself stuck, not knowing how to advance to the next part. I had to make generous use of a walkthrough to move through the game. After reading the solutions, I often found that there was no way I could have thought about doing that, and so it reduced greatly my enjoyment and desire to even try in the next scene. The other downside of this difficulty was that all of my brainpower went into trying to solve puzzles, which made it much harder to focus on the strengths of this game: it's atmosphere and story.\n\nTo conclude, if you are a fan of cyberpunk stories, you should definitely try this game; you'll be greatly rewarded narratively for it, especially if you don't mind using a walkthrough. If you don't care for cyberpunk and are primarily a point-and-click adventure fan, there are definitely better games out there for you. I guess hardcore point-and-click fans who love difficult puzzles might enjoy it.\n\nThanks, Technocrat Games, for a great story!", "timestamp_created": 1483921659, "timestamp_updated": 1483921659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29130007": {"recommendationid": "29130007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048854247", "num_games_owned": 384, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 1012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483915828}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "Ez a j\u00e1t\u00e9k az\u00e9rt keltette fel a figyelmemet, mert egyr\u00e9szt klasszikus point and click kalandj\u00e1t\u00e9k, m\u00e1sr\u00e9szt, mert sci-fi, harmadr\u00e9szt pedig, mert a kiad\u00f3 a Wadjet Eye Games, akiknek a Blackwell kvadrol\u00f3gi\u00e1t k\u00f6sz\u00f6nhetj\u00fck, ami egyik kedvenc kalandj\u00e1t\u00e9k-sorozatom.

But shit, I guess I didn't see Technobabylon coming. I'll admit I had to refer to walkthroughs for a lot of the second half of this game, but honestly I wish I hadn't because all the puzzles are actually completely achievable if you think about them long enough (again, patience isn't a strong point for me).\nAll of the gameplay aspects totally hooked me right off the bat - I started this game right on the cusp of Christmas and the New Year, and I spent a lot of moments that probably should have been spent celebrating playing this game instead. I have no regrets. Awesome start to 2017. This game gave me clear skin, cured my depression and inspired me to achieve more. \n\nAnyway, that's before we even get to the characters. Honestly the characters in any game always make or break it for me, and in this case they totally made it. Charlie is incredibly sweet and easy to relate with, Latha is simulateously adorable and the coolest protagonist ever, and Lao is a fucking boss. This is the point where my stupidly in-depth review that noone is gonna read gets more spoilery and much more contentious, but it had a massive impact on my experience so I'm just gonna have to go there...\nA large problem people seem to perceive with minority characters is this idea that they only exist for the creator to show off how 'socially aware' they are. I mostly see people who aren't part of the minority groups at hand talking about this, and honestly, the only way you could make any kind of insightful critisism of a minority character is if you ARE that minority. I know we all like to think that we can think through every puzzle in the world whether it's race or gender, but I've had to learn over a long time that it's definitely not as simple as just thinking objectively. \nAs a white person in New Zealand, I do all I can to advocate against racial violence, because I'm never going to experience having my rights as a white person being subtly exploited on a grand scale, via laws implemented by other white people back when you could sell human beings. \nAny opinion I have on Lao's writing or characterisation as an East Asian character are never going to be as good or in depth as those of any given Asian person, because I just don't know what it's like to be Asian. Even just under the general title of 'transgender' I'm sure you can hear a million different feelings and interpretations on Max Lao, from people with massively different experiences and perspectives. With this in mind, that's why I roll my eyes when I see people who aren't transgender talking smack about the presence of trans characters in media. If you want to help keep damaging or stupid characterisations out of games, any of the people writing those reviews will probably give you lots of stuff to look out for (see: the trope of being outed against one's will).\n\nWITH THAT BEING SAID. I loved Lao. I love how her backstory is revealed, I love how she is the one who CHOOSES to reveal it to Charlie on her own terms, and I love how for once I got to play a game that doesn't decide to have a protagonist who can probe the trans character with invasive or demeaning questions *cough Dragon Age Inquisition cough*. Obviously those interactions have their place, but Jesus, we get it already. There are more interesting conversations to see about a character being trans than just that. The world will not suffer for having one less game where a character gets interrogated on why she chose to be a girl. \nAs anyone who's still reading has probably guessed at this point, I'm transgender myself, but I don't know what it's like to be raised as a boy and then try and carve my way from there. It's a hugely different experience and there is a lot to Lao that I honestly can't really say whether it's done right or not, I just wouldn't know. \nAnd I mean even aside from all this, it's really a pretty miniscule plot point, so I don't know if I missed anything but there's not really a whole lot of room FOR a problem. This makes it seem like it was a humungous part of the game and it really wasn't, as with a lot of other minority appearances, re: the interracial gay couples I've seen someone get massively upset over. As well as a robot that they claimed to be gay, with no supporting evidence. But that's none of my business. \nThere's not really much I can say about the other minority appearances in this game, other than 'they were there'. It would've been a really cool opportunity to have a disabled character that wasn't a villain, but again, I don't really know much more about that - maybe we'll see that in the next installment from these guys! \n\nI LOVE this game. It wasn't perfect, but I definitely didn't see this review coming when I bought this game and had I known I would've happily paid more. I'm definitely going to be recommending this to people in the future, and keeping tabs on the team behind it because they were the ones who DECIDED for make such bold claims for this game, and it paid off.

The visuals are the first thing that draws my eye. It's futuristic landscape and location both in the physical world and virtual are incredibly eye catching. In this adventure you play a detective on the trail of a serial killer and a net junky who has been suffering a series of unfortunate events if you will. \n\nStarting off you aren't exactly sure how these two character's stories seem to connect and that's an underlying mystery as they both have missions of their own, crossing but for the most part independent of one another. The story itself while is not hard to follow does have a lot of science and a bit of technical jargon mixed in but nothing too hard to follow. Each chapter is great at giving you a piece of the bigger picture without completely confusing the player and I appreciated when I got to experience past events that helped explain our main detective's state of mind. This all leads to a natural progressions of things and events that come together so smoothly. When you have that \"aha\" moment it just fits and everything makes sense. \n\nAs with most adventure games you have your fair share of puzzles. The beginning is where I was most frustrated because it confused me how I would take a physical object into the internet realm but after that initial segment puzzles were a bit easier. They required a bit of thinking. A lot of moving my mouse over random stuff to see if I could click it and a lot of paying attention to my surroundings and conversations. There's various puzzles in each chapter and usually you're putting your detective skills to good use. I found the final set of puzzles particularly clever and fun to figure out because you had to utilize all 3 characters to solve it. \n\nThis game by far has the best representation of online interactions, even a torturous little mini-game by the name of Gravball, which happens to be human Pong. I must have spent the better part of half an hour trying to beat the computer legit. Even with the game being linear I never felt like I was stuck in an area for too long. Things never got stale or boring. It's rare that an adventure can keep my interests straight through. And I didn't think it suffered any of the pitfalls that other games seem to possess. \n\nSo in short you've got a beautiful, fast paced game with intelligent varied puzzles.

Basically in every scene you get hints about bigger things going on outside of the actual story. This universe is full, complex, seducive.\n\nAs in \"Germini Rue\", the story is serious, grown-up and complex ... with separate storylines getting entagled. The concern then is (and it is not fully ruled out) that not all details of the storylines add up or are fully covered. But this times, in the last chapter, they do a lot to add one and one together and to explain the big plot governing all the separate stories. \n\nAnd here, in this last chapter, is my single point of critic about the storytelling: They do too much! If you want you can get expansive explanations by three or more characters. For one, if you really go through all the dialouges then, the final loses its pacing (so much time for talk when danger is imminent?). And secondly, not all of the dialouge options then add up in a sensible order.\nBut that is a bit \"splitting hairs\". The story is good!

A game that many people call one of the best new adventure games.  It's really not.  It's very nostalgic and a great call back to the adventure games of the past, but that's where it belongs in the past and not now.  First off, this horrendous pixel style needs to stop.  It's bad, real bad.  It looks ugly, trying to copy the pixel graphic style of games older than Kings Quest 5 is just not something I want to see.  I assume some people do, but I have no idea why.  At worst it should have the clean visual style of the Moneky Island remasters games.  I know this studio loves their pixel graphics, but harenking back to the terrible graphics of the past is not the way to go. \n\nYou play the game as 3 different characters.  A senior detective on the police force, who is kind of this old curmudgen who hates technology and dislikes the direction the future has taken (also he is from Texas...apparently in the future Texans have no accents).  His partner, a young female detective who is a computer expert and is very much on board with the direction the future has taken and all set to accept her AI overlords.  Finally, a young female hacker, who is addicted to the internet and spends her entire life in the internet...hacking?  Of these three i liked the female detective the most and really just wanted to play the game as her the whole time, which is unfortunate because she probably has the least amount of time in the game. \n\nOn the up side this game is far better than Gemini Rue.  The voice acting is better, the puzzles are better, the environments are better.  I really thought the voice actors did a fine job, certainly not the best job, but a fine job.  The puzzles are a lot less pixel hunty than Gemini Rue which is great.  However, the puzzles also aren't very good. They certainly don't take a lot to figure out.  I only found myself stuck on the very last puzzle in the game which involved a wrench and I had to eventually just give up.  I'm pretty confident i would never have figured it out as it required me to do something that I didn't even think was possible.  The rest of the puzzles are mainly easy, because their are very few items in the environment to click on, so most of the time i was just stumbling into solutions without even thinking.\n\nReally, though I can forgive basically anything so long as the story is good, which is also where this game fails the most.[spoiler] I certainly like the world the game created.  This idea that after countless wars cities start to use AI to govern and administer is intriquing.  A wonderful cyberpunk setting.  Sadly, i thought i was getting a detective story in this setting, what I got was kind of a mishmash government conspiracy story and although you are a detective the story really just flows without you doing much detecting.  Oh sure the plot makes your main character out to be one of the best detectives...which is nonsensical considering you are also the greatest scientist...who i guess felt a career change to detective was a better choice?  It doesn't make any sense.  The plot moves along with your detecting mainly being stumbling into situation after situation without ever really figuring out or discovering anything.  I figured out who was behind the murders in the first hour of the game, but not due to any clues, simply because they came off as super evil and there were no other characters in the game.  The motive is revealed in an info dump near the end of the game...but you never had any clues to figure it out beforehand.  I find these types of mysteries maddening.  It shows a great lack of ability in the writing, they don't understand how to lay out a trail of clues or introduce nuance.  They just tell you the story as you go introducing one rediculous reveal after another.  \n\nThe final reveal that the AI is basically your child, and the person behind the murders is also your child, and the internet addict is also your child is just obnoxious.  Although I did enjoy my ending that the AI wants to govern the world to be a very fun cyberpunk ending.  Also because i found the AI the most likeable character in the game, i think the writers wanted the AI to come off as worrisome if not evil, but the whole game i was like man people should just do what this AI tells them it's master plan is clearly the best.  [/spoiler]\n\nSo yea, that's Technobabylon, another mediocre adventure game from the studio dedicated to making classic nostalgia adventure games.  Sigh, I feel if they just embraced the modern developments and story telling techniques games like Life is Strange have made they might be able to accomplish something very special, but instead they like to just lie back and copy what has already been done and like the main character in this game they shall always be stuck in the past.  Still, I enjoyed my time with it, just get it on massive sale, or you know just buy Life is Strange the best adventure game ever made.

I loved every second of it, despite a few puzzle hickups where online walkthroughs had to help me.\n\nWritten and directed, created and voiced by only a few, yet on the peek of what can be done in this industry, I would say it\u00b4s a masterpiece in it\u00b4s own right. Let me further explain why:\n\n\n[b]Art and Graphics:[/b]\n\n- One of the lesser impressive things are the graphics. You can literally count the pixels because of the pixelart. The unique touch in this game\u00b4s visual design lies less in its color scheme or art design but more in the story and characters that it has. It\u00b4s not the prettiest at all, clearly a reasoning with the creators budget. It keeps true to the atmopshere and visual response etiquette of such games though and delivers all it needs to for what it wants to achieve in order to suck you into the world.\n\n\n[b]Technical issues and bugs:[/b]\n\n- Didn\u00b4t encounter any bugs in playing this roughly for 19 hrs. Completed. Experienced one issue though, audio controls in the options menu don\u00b4t control the speech volume which has to be set through windows audio mixer instead. Naggy but alt tab works easily. Everything else just worked as it should. High quality for the few people that worked on it. \n\n\n[b]Story and characters:[/b]\n\n- Now here it all comes together into why it\u00b4s such a masterfully crafted game. Not only are all characters shaped with unique and likeable or understandable/reasonable personalities and motives but they also all have their own useful role in a complete story with twists and plots/schemes. The theme of the game builds upon that and combines these characters and the well written dialogues and philosophical scaffolding under the sci fi transhumanistic topic it\u00b4s made for with such detailed plotting, it blew me away at times. I literally was blown away each anew that characters in a video game could even be written and thought off as such diverse and well build figures. Usage is smart and they clearly preferred having less useless characters but instead craft a lot well done ones into their storyweb together with good humor and cheeky sarcasm. Love it. You could literally fill a whole wikipage just with this game and create an own universe out of it. Genetics, cannibalism, morals, old vs new standards, transhumanism, synths and robots, consciousness and cloning, gengineering, AI and selfawareness, religious terrorism, nuclear fallout and it\u00b4s aftermath, VR, organic computing, etc and much more, it\u00b4s all in there to feed the sci fi nerds mind. Psychological and emotional drama with decisions. You also can decide from time to time in certain situations how an outcome will play out. Of couse with different endings too. The game has it all and works like a well oiled machine. It even introduced new stuff I didn\u00b4t think of before and made me curious like: Wetware and AI splitting. It leaves you thinking after finishing it. And it will always become a conclusive whole. No stupid hidden secrets, no stupid easter egg story details, old school straight up masterwork of writing. It\u00b4s pretty mature with gore and darker topics throughout. No children allowed. Thank god.\n\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\n\n- Your usual point n click adventure, let\u00b4s you think outside the box, combine tools or hack systems with wetware, use CI splitters to swap out modules of personality and memory. Less hammer on nail, but creative stuff where a casual adventurer with no brain for technology will often just trial and error. PnC veterans though will have a smooth and enjoyable non stressful ride. Except for a few situations where the game really was unhelpful in even giving me hints in what to do, I had to get myself some walkthroughs. And those scenes really blew. In total only 3 though. Not much in a game of 10 chapters with 14hrs of gameplay, if you take away my idling and fooding.\n\nLoved every second of it. Get it.

The story is tight and paced well, the characters are engaging and well written and the puzzles blend into the plot with general seemlessness.\n\nNot everyone will be on board with the pixel art style and AGS engine (which is frankly starting to show its age even in 'faux-retro' titles like this) but it's hard to complain about stuff like that when it suits the storytelling style so well and there's obviously so much love put into these environments and characters; it's really remarkable what the developers have done within the constraints of the tools they're working with.\n\nI found the difficulty of the puzzles somewhat on the easy side and there was never a point where I had to reach for a walkthrough, but then I'm a genre-veteran. The game pretty sucessfully (and organically) limits inventory and number of spaces to explore, and the characters around you are usually dropping subtle hints in dialouge as to how to proceed which keeps things moving. There's more than one way to solve a number of the challenges too which is a nice touch.\n\nSo, if you're looking for something that'll keep you busy for 10-15 hours and maybe spark off a few neurons as you wonder where technology is taking us as a species then you could do a lot worse than take a trip to Newtown in 2087. I feel there's a lot more exploring to be done in this world and I'd love to spend more time with these characters too... sequel? Please? \n\nOn a side note, I'd like to give this game extra-special props for being one of the few games (or pieces of media period) to do representation of minorities in a really great way; two of the PCs are female non-caucasians and a major character is trans. The game and dialouge never hammer any of these points or use them as cheap ways to stir controversy and all come across as individuals. It's really great to see people from many different racial backgrounds and sexual orientations in roles both heroic and villanious and to be able to interact with them without these identifiers being the defining aspects of their characters.

The concept is strong and the writing is largely very good, I just found the gameplay itself to be lacking.", "timestamp_created": 1480436149, "timestamp_updated": 1487117289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499827", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28057199": {"recommendationid": "28057199", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969601029", "num_games_owned": 458, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480422431}, "language": "english", "review": "I have to say, Technobablyon is the first point and click adventure I've really enjoyed.\n\nAll of the puzzles are SMART. Not just \"click random thing on random other things until stuff happens\". You can actually THINK about the puzzles, think about what could actually solve them, then work towards those solutions, making for satisfying gameplay!\n\nThe characters are also smart! They're different, wrong sometimes, make mistakes, but they actually try to think and understand what is going on. I enjoyed all of the protagonists.\n\nI'm happy to say that every time I got stumped on a puzzle (with one minor exception, mentioned below), it wasn't because the solution was bizarre or counter-intuitive, it was just that I hadn't thought about the actual facts of puzzle the right way.\n\nThe major downside is the ending (spoilers).\n\nA minor flaw is it sloppily scripted (lots of weird bugs that you can cause, nothing game-breaking but obviously not been through thorough QA, like the door lock lights disappearing (not turning off - literally disappearing) after you go through the door and return, or Lao being able to hand her wetware to Regis but not get it back).\n\nIt's also unclear that there is an entire third floor in the Trance, making the final part of the puzzle a matter of luck or blind guesswork.\n\nBut the big part is the endings are unsatisfying. Either you force a person into slavery, or you force them into being someone else's agenda and to go through an invasive mind-altering procedure without their input. I would have been much happier if there was a third option, where you can actually respect the autonomy of the AGI and let it free without compulsion.

Un bon quart du jeu se passe d'ailleurs dans une simulation informatique qui nous est d\u00e9crite comme un deuxi\u00e8me monde fascinant, un Eden de gigaoctets, un univers parall\u00e8le fantastique dans lequel des millions d'utilisateurs g\u00e2chent leur vie. Un paradis virtuel auquel on a du mal \u00e0 croire : desservi par des id\u00e9es vusuelles dat\u00e9es, ce [i]web 3.0[/i] fait peine \u00e0 voir avec son interface d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9ment vide et ses allures de Minitel sous VR.\n\nLe sc\u00e9nario n'est pas si emballant que \u00e7a non plus. Le stylo est un peu trop lourd, l'\u00e9criture un poil trop facile pour nous surprendre. Technobabylon exag\u00e8re des rebondissements glauques pour avoir l'air cool ; ses th\u00e9ories correspondent si bien aux peurs dict\u00e9es par les meilleurs romans d'anticipation qu'il n'a rien trouv\u00e9 de mieux que de les d\u00e9passer dans l'exc\u00e8s pour s'en distinguer ; Technobabylon oublie d'\u00eatre autre chose qu'un Game of Thrones du futur, une oeuvre qui, \u00e0 force de vouloir nous montrer \u00e0 quel point elle peut \u00eatre sombre, donne l'impression de n'\u00eatre qu'un adolescent un peu intelligent qui montre \u00e0 tout-va des captures d'\u00e9cran du [i]deep web[/i] pour impressionner ses camarades de classe, un r\u00e9cit immature qui ne cherche \u00e0 choquer que pour choquer. C'est pourtant au milieu de cette d\u00e9bauche souvent inutile que Technobabylon est paradoxalement le plus int\u00e9ressant : cette vision [i]forc\u00e9ment![/i] dystopique du lendemain a le m\u00e9rite de confronter les \u00e9lans d'aujourd'hui aux chutes qui les attendent, met le doigt sinon sur les exc\u00e8s, sur la dynamique de notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui ne cherche \u00e0 violer ses tabous que pour le simple plaisir de se f\u00e9liciter d'avoir pu le faire. Les justifications morales qui nous encombraient disparaissent, la b\u00eatise et l'\u00e9go\u00efsme peuvent briller de tout leur \u00e9clat. Comme dans un concours de pipi t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9 o\u00f9 on jubile jaune d'\u00eatre regard\u00e9 par le monde entier, la seule satisfaction est d'\u00eatre all\u00e9 plus loin que les autres.\n\nTechnobabylon n'est pas un bon thriller ; il raconte une enqu\u00eate dont on comprend les aboutissants trop vite. Mais il est un bon point & click aux \u00e9nigmes logiques quoi qu'un brin inattendues. Divis\u00e9e en dix actes, l'aventure claque et verrouille chacune des portes que l'on passe ; impossible de revenir sur les tableaux des chapitres pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. L'aire de jeu (et donc des puzzles) est limit\u00e9e et \u00e9vite ainsi les \u00e9cueils d'une progression labyrinthique. Les rares \u00e9nigmes farfelues sont compens\u00e9es par cette progression parfaitement d\u00e9limit\u00e9e. Parce qu'il nous pousse toujours en avant, Technobabylon est un chemin sans impasses.\n\nTechnobabylon est parfois maladroit, souvent trop absolu. Mais il n'est avare de rien ; le background est document\u00e9, le gameplay tire profit des trois h\u00e9ros \u00e0 incarner, tous les dialogues sont doubl\u00e9s et le sont tr\u00e8s bien - si on accepte d'oublier un personnage fran\u00e7ais qui ne sait pas parler fran\u00e7ais. C'est une histoire aux grosses ficelles qui arrive quand m\u00eame \u00e0 \u00eatre touchante ; c'est un r\u00e9cit bavard qui dit tout ce qui lui passe par la t\u00eate, une aventure qui a beaucoup de choses \u00e0 montrer et \u00e0 sugg\u00e9rer. Les cons\u00e9quences d'un monde o\u00f9 les enfants ne s'amusent qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9passer les lignes rouges trac\u00e9es par leurs parents.

The mechanics were good enough, though, so I figured I'd give Technobabylon a go since it had a similar \"look\" to it in terms of having the appearance of a '90s adventure game. When the game loaded, I saw that the same publisher made the game, and I immediately felt my heart sink, because Kathy Rain put me out so badly, and when Technobabylon started, its gameplay mechanics were obviously not as streamlined as Kathy Rain's, having less interaction options, less stuff to interact with on each screen, less mandatory dialog, and interactive stuff did not show on the screen when pushing a button like in Kathy Rain (spacebar). Technobabylon was going to be a techno-turd...or so I thought.\n\nInstead, I found a game with far more relevant characters, likable characters (for me, at least), legitimate antagonists (screw you, Crimson Man from Kathy Rain!), and a story and world that were quite intriguing. It's a cyberpunk setting where a large city has had an AI put in charge of all of its civil services, and a couple of your characters you control are officers of the law, who report to the AI, dealing with manhunts, homicide, etc. The guy has a nice character arc, the gal is just plain likable, and another female you play as gives you the impression in her first 30 seconds of self-narrated introduction that she's going to be one thing, then you really see what's going on right after and realize her opinion of herself and the reality are quite different, and makes for an interesting character.\n\nAs a cop of the world, you will be mostly dealing with physical things in the world, with a stun gun and standard adventure game puzzle-solving. However, as the one girl, you enter the \"TRANCE,\" which is basically The Matrix/TRON. Users have digital avatars and can interact online with one another. Due to the plot, you'll do very little of interacting with other users, except at one point in the game. Most of the time, however, you will be rubbing blue gel on machines to establish a connection between them and you, letting you interact with comical artificial intelligences to try to resolve problems that would otherwise be impossible for her to overcome in the real world. It's a nice spin to have the game change things up in this fashion.\n\nThe introductions of characters are informative and there are a fair number of surprises in terms of certain characters showing up again who seemed like a one-time thing, much to my delight. My favorite character was practically a gag character, but was in the game sporadically until the end. No amazing villains, but they're pretty decent; one's a bit of an eye-roll-inducer (for me, anyway). This world is just pretty cool. It \"borrows\" a lot from stuff like TRON/The Matrix/Shadowrun (a character even calls the real world the \"meatspace,\" but it still felt like an original story, with plenty of dressing of things that weren't crucial to the main plot but did wonders for world-building. \n\nThe puzzles made me think much of the time, though there were times I was clicking on things at random if I got stuck. I managed to avoid using a walkthrough except ONE time. It was literally the final puzzle I had left to solve in the game (involved some glowing lights on a wall that I couldn't find). The difficulty of the game was nice and had less rage-inducing puzzles than Kathy Rain did, and it didn't feel so \"anal\" as Kathy rain in regard to having to go through every piece of dialog to proceed (though I did because the world, story, and characters interested me).\n\nI would love to see more games in this world, but in different cities and with new and returning characeters. Heck, I'll just admit it: I loved Cheffie. I think we're suppose to hate her or be annoyed by her, but man was she fun for me. Anywho, I think sequels or prequels set in different parts of the world not strongly connected to each storyline could be excellent, and I would love to see them get made.

It is not bad, and the pixelated graphics give nice retro feel to the whole experience, while telling a futuristic cyberpunk story. Some of the characters were nice to follow. Some puzzles could be solved in a few ways, unlocking different achievements. Overall I kept playing this game, which is enough of a reason to say it can be enjoyable.\n\nThere always will be a 'but' at some point that changes the whole statement, right?\n\nWell, as I said, some characters are interesting to follow. However, the story switches between three main ones, with short flashbacks where we follow side ones. The voiceover on some of them is bad, and one of the main characters sounds so awfully unnatural I was at some point considering quitting the otherwise interesting plot.\n\nThe switching between MCs points of view is probably intended to show variety of classic cyberpunk landscapes. Expensive apartments, rundown basements, abandoned factories, sprinkly-clean laboratories, neon skyscrapers etc etc., all the while mentioning stuff that cyberpunk is most known for. Global corporations, cloning, gen. engineering, all-powerful AI, androids, cyborgs, virtual reality, loss of identity, background brutal warfare etc. Nothing of that sounds particularly new. There are some new, sometimes amusing ideas, but they are wasted with overwhelming majority of the usual.\n\nThe animation. oh boy. Pixelated graphics have their appeal, which i personally enjoy, yet they are so badly animated for some characters, you'd think this game is not really retro, but 20 years old. Maybe that's the idea. I wouldn't mind, but while all character's close-up portraits are nice, as are most sceneries and animations, some fail horribly. Two of the MCs look like they were made with MS Paint. Graphics range from eye-catching to blocky gibberish pixelgore.\n\n\nOkay, I am proud of you if you managed to read it up to this point. So I'll just make my opinion short: don't buy this game for full price, it's not worth if you're into indie retro ones.

The setting and writing was very enjoyable, the art excellent, and the music immersive.  But the main point of this kind of adventure is exploring the story, which requires a good story to be a good game.  Technobabylon doesn't disappoint me here.\n\nAs someone interested in the virtual, metaverses, etc, I was on board immediately with the concept that the Trance provided, and other sci-fi concepts (such as gengineering) had enough grounding in modern science to give a bit of a \"This could be the future\" edge.  But it's not all dark, gritty, and brooding.  There is a LOT of dialog to explore, and there were quite a few moments I laughed out loud, mostly due to AI personalities (Turret + Cheffie = absolutely hilarious)\n\nThe puzzles were largely simple for me to figure out, and the only places I got stuck and had to look online for help were when I was missing something entirely -- it's not so bad you could call it pixel-hunting, but you still need to be thorough if you find yourself getting stuck.  Death is handled in a forgiving manner, simply rewinding back to a state just before you died if you did something foolish.\n\nI ended up playing through this twice -- the second time with commentary and to pick up 100% achievements -- and I bought a copy for my sister and recommended it to a friend.  I'd recommend it for anyone who enjoys point-and-click adventure types, cyberpunk settings, and have a taste for automeals served by an AI so cheerful it should be criminal.\n\nOverall play time for both runs was ~20 hours for me. Given my second run was much faster, I'd say you're probably looking at a 10 to 15 hour experience. That may not seem like much, but it was a very enjoyable time, and I've put more hours into games and got less out of them in the past, so I'd say it was worth it.\n\nAlso, I want that \"nom nom nom\" sound, and I don't know why.", "timestamp_created": 1478217467, "timestamp_updated": 1478217467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26404499": {"recommendationid": "26404499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030590300", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478201354}, "language": "english", "review": "[b] What a drag of a game to get through a great story.

Perhaps it was the fusion between cyberpunk and neo-noir genres and the similarities I could observe between this game and one of my favorite movies of all time, Blade Runner. Technobabylon has an intriguing plot of its own, which I won\u2019t spoil but I can assure it that it is quite original and this time, you\u2019re actually getting your money\u2019s worth. There were a few instances which required that you return to a previously \u201cswept\u201d area and use the newly acquired itmes in your inventory. I\u2019m not a fan of backtracking in general but at least there weren\u2019t many such situations. The point & click interface runs smoothly but it took some tinkering with the game\u2019s graphical settings before I was satisfied with the result and the dialogue font is a bit pixeated for my taste but it wasn\u2019t that much of a strain. On the other hand, the  soundtrack truly stands out and the many commentaries (on each scene and on some interactions) from the developer and publisher, reveled just how important this project has been to them. I respect that. All in all, you\u2019re in for a decently lengthy adventure, should you choose to give Technobabylon a try. It really has few flaws and I hope we may see a sequel to it one day.\n\n[h1]Strong Points[/h1]\n+ Excellent storyline.\n+ Beautiful art style and tech-noir setting.\n+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.\n+ In-game commentaries from the dev team.\n\n[h1]Weak Points[/h1]\n- Some puzzles involve backtracking to a previous scene.\n\n[b]Rating 8/10[/b]\n \n[quote]This review was submitted

An immense amount of thought went into background details about the universe. I feel like I know things about the place that these characters live.\n\u2022 The voice acting is well done.\n\u2022 The characters are likeable, but flawed.

Pacing is entierly thrown out the window.\n\u2022 The art style of the characters is dramatically different from the enviornments. And a lot rougher. The result is a disconnect between the actors and the scene.\n\u2022 A fair few of the puzzles rely on obscure 'find the hidden object' solutions.

Set in a dystopian future (they sure do love that aesthetic) of quarreling nation-states with drastically different governments, you play a pair of detectives, and an unlikely accomplice, in a futuristic city known as Newton. The city is under threat by a mysterious character known as the mindjacker who steals peoples\u2019 minds for unknown reasons and you are tasked with bringing him to justice. \n\nTypical for Wadjet Eye, this game offers a new interactive system to spice things up called \u2018wetware\u2019, wherein the user can connect wirelessly with people or systems allowing the player to solve puzzles via interactions in an abstract parallel world known as the Trance (e.g. cyberspace). Eventually you also gain the ability to manipulate artificial intelligence entities, called synths, through special programs that control their personalities.\n\nThe environments in Technobabylon are much more constrained than those in other adventure games by this studio which has a slight side effect of making a good number of the puzzles easier to solve since you don\u2019t have as many rooms to cycle through and consequently less items to interact with as well. Seasoned PnC adventure game veterans might be turned off a bit by this aspect but I found that the story and consequence system (as well as the alternate ending) make up for it. The game is also very dialogue heavy but the majority of it is well-spent and you will find yourself learning more about characters and the world surrounding them instead of feeling like you\u2019re wasting your time.\n\nIn an era where AAA studios are pumping out non-stop schlock, it\u2019s refreshing to see a title like Technobabylon that bucks the trend and delivers a great experience at the same time.

How's that possible? Let me explain.\n\nI don't much care for puzzles in point and click games \u2013 some people call them illogical, some absurd, some charmingly crazy. For me they're fun, although, in this particular case, I had to peek into a walkthrough a couple of times because I've missed some almost-pixel-size items. The point is \u2013 gameplay contains everything you would expect from this genre. And it's OK.\n\nMy reservation concern the most important element of the game \u2013 the story. There are no good characters in \u201eTechnobabylon\u201d. By good I mean morally good, not well written. There is a struggle at the top of the food chain between overly controlling cyberpunky-antiutopian AI and a bunch of plutocrats/oligarchs. We see debauchery, hypocrisy, hubris and greed all around. Even our protagonists aren't really characters to root for. One of them is an internet junkie (or, to be precise, trance junkie, futuristic VR version of the internet), who's addicted to information stream, bright colour-flickering images bombarding senses, for whom real world is too slow and too demanding; other one being an ex-bioengineer who used to make suicide bombers, a pro-eugenics scientist, shady (at best) in bioethics field, now a good ol' grumpy cop.\n\nI was getting further and further into the story, yet getting more and more impatient that there is no person in the game's world who I wanted to succeed. And then it hit me. It's exactly how it supposed to be. After all the title of the game is \u201eTechnoBABYLON\u201d \u2013 it's supposed to be a moral depravity feast. But the plot missed something, something crucial for this type of story. It missed it's \u201eidiot\u201d, it's good guy, it's Shatov (Comparing \u201eTechnobabylon\u201d to Dostoyevsky is unfair, but his works, in this case especially \u201eDemons\u201d, are a good example of stories exploring demoralized circles).\n\nI understand that the creators' vision is a depressing one. But do I need to spend a few hours watching multitude of ways in which humans can be bad? I know they can be evil, I'm one of them. The game shows a world filled with decadence, but I may as well look out the window. And may even be surprised what I'll found. Even if you think that goodness can't prevail or is naive \u2013 show it. Create a character like Simon from \u201eLord of the Flies\u201d and show him fail. You can argue that our main heroes are trying to do some good, but actually they're just trying to get out of trouble they got in during the course of the plot (still, Regis is getting \u201eredemption arc\u201d at the very end).\n\nIf you just want to relax after a day of hard work, you'll be satisfied. Characters are likeable, pacing is all right and pixel-arty environments are quite pretty.

Als neue Droge gibt es Trance, eine virtuelle Welt in der man jemand ist.\nDie Stadt wird von einer KI \u00fcberwacht die alles und jeden kontrolliert. Zuviel verraten w\u00e4re bl\u00f6d, aber es geht um Mord und Verschw\u00f6rungen.\n\nR\u00e4tsel:\nWirklich ein angenehmer Schwierigkeitsgrad, hat mir gut gefallen. es gab teilweise mehre Wege zum Ziel. Wobei die R\u00e4tsel nie unfair waren. Wie bei jedem Adventure einfach rumprobieren.\n\nGrafik:\nWadjet Eye Stil, kein Unterschied zu anderen Spiele des Publishers. Wobei mir das Zukunftsszenario wirklich gut gef\u00e4llt.\n\u00c4hnlich wie Gemini Rue oder Blade Runner.\n\nSound:\nSehr gute Sprachausgabe und gute Sound- sowie Musikeffekte.

Wadjet Eye's releases have proven that point time and again. Luckily, Technobabylon is no exception. It is not the first dystopia in the publisher's books (that would be Gemini Rue, and later they have released the post-apocalyptic Primordia), but it might very well be their best one.\nThe technosceptical story builds a world that at its best moments is at par with William Gibson's Neuromancer and treads similar grounds concerning AIs, digital life, life in the digital and autoritarian societies. And yet, all this heady social critique does not become moralizing grouchiness. The multi-plot narration - done with very competent voice-acting for all dialogue- keeps players engaged with interesting, deep characters and some nicely staged twists (though admittedly some are not as twisty as the writers obviously thought them to be).\nThe puzzles are exceptionally well done, notwithstanding one or two lesser specimen. No spoilers here, but should you get stuck in a kitchen, you'll know what I mean. But all of them are fitting with the characters and the plot; there is nothing haphazardly glued into the game to bolster playtime, no lazy logic puzzles, not much walking around and no backtracking. Top notch design!\nI only played it a year after release, but I have to say that all the laurels Technobabylon gathered in 2015 were well-earned.

A lot of its dystopian themes seem very plausibly real and dont stray too much into the realm of science fantasy to break my suspension of disbelief.  Add on top of that some very well acted characters (Charlie and Max specifically) and villains, a heavy plot that balances itself very well without overdoing it, and you have a great game.  \n\nThere is also a nuanced influence of dialogue choices that impact the game's responses and dialogue without going the route of being an aparrent and forced good-neutral-bad ending choice factor, while still feeling relevant to the story.  I liked it.  If there's anything I disliked, its that Latha's character felt too one dimensional and tangential to the rest of the story, and that her specific sections involving using the web were lacking a robust realization like the rest of the setting.  I forgive them though, since most all other stories in the near-future scifi genre haven't come up with a really robust way to depict a brain-to-machine immersive version of the internet.\n\nPuzzles and mechanics-wise, the game is solid.  As always there is 'that one puzzle' that necessitates a guide, but that is always true of the genre and is not something I look down upon.  There are failstates, but only in a few specific points of the game.  Be warned, some of the scenes in the game can be particularly gruesome and unpleasant to watch (namely the flashback scene with [spoiler]the maidservant gynoid violently disembowling its hallucinating owner after he kills his spouse[/spoiler]), but they are treated with severity and not present to glorify the gruesomeness of the act.\n\nAltogether the game runs about 10 hours if my playtime on steam is accurate.

I've also often found that people are easily impressed by mediocre fare in just about anything, so me saying something is \"passable\" could mean it's the best thing you've ever seen in your life. That really depends on what you're used to more than anything. Having said that:\n\nThe episodic format shows.The game kind-sort-of felt as if it wasn't made as a cohesive whole, and that individual \"episodes\"  were too \"tight\" to really let you soak in the atmosphere. Which is a shame, as there was plenty of atmosphere, and the individual epozodes were rather good overall.\n\nHowever, it did feet like it was going out of it's way to put the player in one \"room escape\" scenario after another. The overall plot was a bit too grand which made various things feel a bit too drastic. It seems to have elements in place, so to speak, for large multi-plot games like, say, Discworld: Noir, but it turns out to not really be that kind of game. I guess the plot feels strangely  linear, because the game has the old style grapics groove going on, but lacks a central semi-non-linear \"open world\" item chase chapter that's a staple of the old non-episodic classics. Making one of those is a nightmare, and it would've made the game twice as long, but the game felt like it needed more time to develop it's various characters, and more space to disperse it's dialogue, world-building and commentary in. For a game which makes dialogue so fun and easy to perform and enjoy, it doesn't really do enough with the dialogue because secondary characters are either villains or only there for one scene.\n\nFor example, I feel the \"comm\" feature was an incredible idea, one that's probably been kicking around many point-and-click and detective game enthusiasts heads. Except it's hardly ever used in the most obvious way it would be used in most games - to cut the time it takes to walk around various locations when you just want to talk to a character. I can think of dozens of games that feature would've made much better than they were (many of them classics). In this game it's usability is severely limited because the game lacks that central faux open-world part. Big props to to the person who went and put that into their game, finally, as it might influence someone else to put it in a game that makes more use out of it. Heck, you could take all the shooty / RPG bits out of Fallout 2, rewrite it as a straight point-and-click / dialogue thing, add that feature to the radio so that you can contact folks over distance, and you'd be rolling in money.\n\nWhich is to say there's some really good stuff here. The android related puzzles were impossibly cool, the actual \"investigation\" episode was also very cool, there's great stuff all over the place. But there are also a few too many instances of characters being able to perform certain actions without the actions making sense at the time. I think I just stumbled onto the solutions to many puzzles, and at times I was stuck because I didn't realize certain actions could even be performed, so I would be lacking a step in an otherwise logical sequence of moves. This might mean that a few things had a step-or-two too many, and for this, I blame the episodic format again - if actions required to accomplish something didn't have to all involve so discreet scenations the flow would be much better.\n\nI've heard complaints about the graphics from folks who can't appreciate symbolic art over \"realism\". I've mixed feelings about it. I'm not necessarily in love with the pixels, as I found the recent remasterings of Lucas Arts stuff quite fine, and I did at times feel like this game could've benefited from a bit more resolution. I wasn't sure it would benefit from more \"realism\" that would end up creating - the gory bits, and there ARE gory bits, would've stood out more, and the naive bits, and there ARE naive bits, would have stood out more, too. Since pacing makes certain plot related things a bit jarring, more detailed graphics wouldn't have necessarily helped there. Plus, quite a bunch of the art is gorgeous.\n\nNow, most of this soounds like criticism, but when you get down to it, I've not really played a more ambitious point-and-clicker that actually delivered as much as Technobabylon did in quite a while. It did more for me on the cyberpunk front than the Shadowrun games, too. I feel like the folks who made it deserve their money, and that the game isn't really dissapointing as much as it stimulates the player to think about how would they have done it better afterwards. Which is a great thing.\n\nI recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1465433090, "timestamp_updated": 1465433732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23375881": {"recommendationid": "23375881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072812047", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464602822}, "language": "swedish", "review": "Wadjet Eye levererar \u00e4nnu en g\u00e5ng ett v\u00e4lproducerat, ambiti\u00f6st och snyggt \u00e4ventyrsspel i dystopisk sci-fi-milj\u00f6 d\u00e4r du guidar tre olika karakt\u00e4rer genom ett konspiratoriskt mysterium i futuristiskt samh\u00e4lle d\u00e4r bioteknik och cyberspace integrerats in i vardagen och sj\u00e4lvmedvetna AI:s \u00e4r verklighet. \n\nBra grafik, klassisk point-n-click kontroll, intressanta karakt\u00e4rer och en handling som l\u00e5nar lagom mycket fr\u00e5n b\u00e5de andra \u00e4ventyrsspelsklassiker s\u00e5som Benath a Steel Sky och sci-fi-filmer s\u00e5som Blade Runner och eXistenZ.

Technobabylon has the quality that is to be expected of Wadjet Eye Games and is perhaps a contender for their best game at the time of writing.  \n\nTechnobabylon takes place in a dystopian future where genetic engineering is common and many people use \"Trance\" instead of interacting with other people normally.  An AI named Central powers the city and the CEL police keep tabs on just about everyone and everything.  As usual with Wadjet Eye Games, the story is high quality and I do seriously hope it continues in a future sequel.\n\nDeveloper Technocrat has pushed the somewhat divisive AGS engine further than I thought it could go; there are many sections involving people connecting to electronic devices and some of the best puzzles take place in this state.  Whether it is just using these devices to obtain download attachments or solving far more complex puzzles, Technobabylon stands out when compared to adventure games using simpler mechanics.  I wasn't expecting some of the puzzles and a few genuinely had me stumped for a while.  So unlike many adventure games, this isn't just a great story based experience, there's challenge here and it's more challenging than most Wadjet Eye Games.\n\nWadjet Eye Games enjoy giving you control over numerous characters and I found that this could lead to some confusion as how to progress.  I liked that this game rarely had any of these moments and when you were able to switch between characters, it would always be in aid of solving a puzzle together.  It's these design choices that make Technobabylon a bit easier to swallow than a game like Resonance.\n\nThere's not a lot else to say, if you are really into Wadjet Eye Games, then you will already have your eye on this.

The plot isn't [i]completely[/i] original - once you look at it closer, you'll notice strong inspirations from Beneath A Steel Sky and Neuromancer, including a few of the puzzles - but it holds its own without feeling derivative. \n\nI did have a few gripes with the game: in particular, some of the lines recorded for Max sounded very differently from the rest and the pixel-art style is less than perfect on a few occasions - seeing \"half pixel\" lines was kind of jarring, and there's a loose plot thread - unfortunately, one rather relevant to the plot (we never really find out why [spoiler]both clones[/spoiler] were created). The game includes an autosave on the start of each chapter, which turned out quite handy in when I ended up in what's probably the only dead-end situation in the game (no way to progress without interacting with an item you can't backtrack to [spoiler]when you climb outside the airship[/spoiler]).\n\nThe limited amount of objects you can interact with in the game's locations has both upsides and downsides - in the 90's adventure games, they often provided a lot of colorful, sometimes humorous, exposition on the game's plot and setting, but from a design perspective, less items for the player to work with means less red herrings (there are a few, such as [spoiler]the toilet cleaner[/spoiler])\n\nIn a nice touch, not all of Technobabylon's puzzles are linear: in several chapters there's more than one solution, and the game rewards you with achievements for discovering each. While they do not alter the course of the game's plot (apart from one in the final chapter), later chapters sometimes contain callbacks to the choices you made earlier.\n\nOver all, the game is not [i]perfect[/i] but thoroughly enjoyable regardless - if you buy it, you won't regret that decision.", "timestamp_created": 1462735772, "timestamp_updated": 1462736292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22855324": {"recommendationid": "22855324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249237304", "num_games_owned": 480, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462641104}, "language": "english", "review": "It seems as if, nowadays, adventure games straddle one of two extremes. They are either interactive works of fiction that don\u2019t offer much in the way of traditional challenge, or they are traditionally difficult point-and-click games with traditionally broken logic. Games that combine a rich story and world building without feeling like a DVR simulator are somewhat rare. Being one of those rare titles is what makes Technocrat Games\u2019s Technobabylon a remarkable experience. First began life as a freeware title, Technobabylon benefits from better production values (evident in the voice acting), revamped and stylistic pixel visuals, and a well assembled adventure experience thanks to the involvement of Wadjet Eye. \n\n[h1] A bit of background [/h1]\nTechnobabylon takes place in a sci-fi setting that is not to dissimilar to what what we\u2019ve seen in adventure video games and other forms of media and entertainment. As you sink into the premise, setting and characters of Technobabylon, its influences become apparent in its nuances. Technobabylon will remind you of classic movies Blade Runner, cult classic games like Policenauts, iconic anime/manga like Ghost in the Shell and even newer anime like Psycho Pass. \n\nIn a city called Newton, a place where science has risen above ethics and morals, and everyone plays god with free-form genetic engineering. Advances in computing power have led to massive advancements in AI, that mostly put to use for monitoring and controlling citizens. Social media and inter-web interaction has gone up a few notches, with the virtual-reality medium called Trance giving people a platform to interact in a virtual world and not deal with the real world responsibilities. Genetic engineering has made stunning advances as well \u2013 when an organic nanomachines called \"wetware\" are invented for many different purposes. Such freedoms and technological progress come at a price, however, when it created a generation of addicts (known as \u201cthralls\u201d) who have no jobs and spend most of their time in \"trance\", or when a genetically engineered children with explosive bones can be made as a suicide bomber. \n\n[h1] The protagonists [/h1]\nMeet Regis, He\u2019s the typical \u201ctoo-old-for-this\" cop, and boy is he too old for this. If Regis could wear a Rage Against the Machine shirt to work, he would. Assuming people remember Rage Against the Machine in post-nuclear 2087. Surveillance cameras, computers, phones, cyborg-style implants\u2014Regis hates the whole lot, and most of all he hates the city\u2019s overzealous artificial intelligence, Central. \nThen there's Lao, an ordinary girl with her cheerfulness and spark keeps her partner Regis\u2019 cynical doom-and-gloom attitude at bay for most of the game and brightens up the atmosphere considerably. In a game that has such a dark plot with so many terrible things happening, Max\u2019s character provides the perfect balance to the mix, adding the sense of hope the story so desperately needs.\nAnd finally Latha. She brings the game its biggest breath of fresh air, as she is able to enter the Trance. From here, she can interact with other users and even AI systems she encounters, displaying them through humanistic avatars complete with unique personalities. Here, the game flexes its creative muscles at not only providing unique gameplay, but also at delivering dialogue with wit and humor as well.\n\nThe way it shuttles you between these three viewpoints is probably one of my favorite aspect of the game. It feels like we learn a lot about the world, thanks to our split perspective. \n\n[h1] Puzzles n' stuff [/h1]\nSpeaking of puzzles, we can agree that the most important part of any puzzle-based games is the presentation of the puzzles themselves, and this is where Technobabylon really delivers. Not every puzzle has the same wealth of approaches, but in general things adhere to each character\u2019s skills\u2014low-fi investigation from Regis, high-tech hacking from Latha, and a bit of both from Lao. It\u2019s a clever conceit that helps make each character feel functionally distinct even within the limited mechanics of a point-and-click adventure game. Whether its remotely piloting drones, manipulating AI personalities, or even solving how to enter through a locked doorway, Technobabylon makes figuring out how to get to the next destination an enjoyable experience. Visually, Tecnobabylon carries a style akin to the DOS adventure game classics from yesteryear, and the pixelated graphics are put to good use to create some detailed environments and character sprites. Neon colors/lighting mixes nicely with the darker contrast and undertones to create an artistically charged setting. Except for the character portraits that pop up in conversations, the game looks like an early 1990s LucasArts adventure game.\n\n[h1] Some minor complaints [/h1]\nDespite the overall positive experience, the playthrough wasn\u2019t without its own set of problems. There are moments when I got confused about what the objects are or how they function, as it is often unclear without clicking on them to get a text description. The low fidelity visuals also contribute to the problem of not always knowing what you can grab from the environment and what you can manipulate. It is easy to miss out on a drawer or a wrench since so many useable items blend into the background. In addition to that, some of the voice acting \u2013 in particular that of Regis \u2013 was a little too monotone, which made even the more dramatic scenes a little less moving. Not to mention that Trance is somewhat underutilized too. We get glimpses of Trance\u2019s potential, especially the part where Latha is constantly swapping between the virtual and physical worlds to solve puzzles. But in general the game doesn\u2019t do enough with a world that has literally zero rules. \n\n[h1] Bottom line [/h1]\nHonestly, I feel like I can write an essay or two about this game. Like drawing some comparison between Central (Newton's overzealous artificial intelligence) and The Sibyl system from Psycho Pass, whether the escapism provided by Trance a blessing in a world gone to hell, or is it merely enabling people to give up on the real world and many other topics to cover. But surely if you managed to make it this far, you want to see my thought about it. While there is no shortage of choice when it comes to adventure games \u2014 especially on Steam \u2014 Technobabylon is not just another face in the crowd. It doesn\u2019t make you feel you are just a passenger along for the ride, nor does it make you feel like you need to be a mind reader to figure out how the developers want you to solve a puzzle. A little fix might have made game more enjoyable in a couple of ways, but the game is still a very easy one to recommend, especially since it's only 15 bucks.", "timestamp_created": 1462674367, "timestamp_updated": 1462706680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.760740", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22819007": {"recommendationid": "22819007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108099827", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507473284}, "language": "english", "review": "Technobabylon is:\n\n\n- The best story wirten in cyberpunk game industry from far, dialogues, everyword is a masterpiece of anticipation concerns\n\n- (for me) an hardcore enigmas based gameplay, I've been stuck a lot of times (used clue 3 - 4 times)\n\n- strange artistic designing (in my op' it should be better without this pixel art)\n\n- First game I played with an interesting approach of cyberspace/hacking gameplay\n\n\nIn other words, it's an absolute must have for all anticipation fans.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1462492485, "timestamp_updated": 1462492485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512245", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22818120": {"recommendationid": "22818120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018514111", "num_games_owned": 1814, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 1211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462388176}, "language": "english", "review": "It's pretty good!

The most striking thing about the game is that it does a far better job at building a fascinating science fiction world than most AAA productions; in this aspect it more closely approaches a good novel than a game, bringing to mind great cyberpunk authors like Rudy Rucker or William Gibson, while at the same time maintaining its own creative identity.  Food, sports, cyberspace and IRL addictions, crime, criminal justice, politics -- it's all handled in an unobtrusive and intriguing way that draws the player deeply in.  The puzzles, which are all of about medium difficulty, all make sense in the context of this world and its tech, coming across more as outgrowth than obligatory tack-on.  It would be a shame for Technocrat's painstakingly crafted milieu to go to waste, and fortunately, there are indications, both in [i]Technobabylon[/i]'s narrative and in the developer commentary, that a sequel may be in the works.  \n   \nThere are a few questions that I would like answered about the mostly *very* impressive story (especially the import of a certain apartment bombing) but these gaps don't trip up the plot for me in the least; some of these can be left for the sequel I suppose, while the remainder can be left to player interpretation without strain on narrative continuity.  The voice acting, as in all Wadjet Eye productions, varies from actor to actor.  It is never bad, but never perfectly professional; it puts me in the mind of an obviously talented community theater troupe rather than a stable of career voice actors, and actually intensifies the hip \"indie\" vibe of the whole production.  I did encounter one minor bug in the game -- a wrench that I could not yank out of a gear because a partition blocked its hotspot -- but it only set me back about about a minute of playtime.\n\n(There were many awesomely odd little incidents that really helped me suspend my disbelief.  For example:  in a scummy VR-hosting dive, the player character must pry off a layer of crusted old wetware -- signal-broadcasting, nanomachine-rich goop that people smear on devices to interface their own internal wiring to those systems -- before she can apply her own and access a machine.

Fortunately, Technobabylon doesn't disappoint.  \n\nThe game pulls you into a great story through strong and relatable characters with clear motivations that you can get behind.  It dangles the mystery like a carrot on a stick, but gives you enough payoffs to keep you going.  The real star, however, is the amazing sense of world-building and atmosphere.  Technobabylon builds an incredibly believable world that builds off of our current technological and societal trajectory and takes it in some very scary directions.  Its atmosphere and soundtrack are also wonderful, creating a completely cohesive and immersive world.\n\nThe interactions between the characters are well done, and there are some standout supporting characters that are a real hoot.  The dialogue can get VERY expositional at times, especially when the plot twists start cropping up near the end, but overall the dialogue is very snappy and well done.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, using great puzzles and exploration that make sense but are still challenging.  It doesn't fall into the normal nonsensical adventure game puzzle tropes, which I'm very thankful for.  You can usually piece together what you need to do from your surroundings and resources, but you still feel smart for figuring it out.

(So I feel I should at least write this review, dammit)\n\nFirst things first, it catches what it takes something to be cyberpunk pretty well.\nIt also abides the number one cyberpunk rule - every character is involved for their own reasons and is trying to resolve their own problems. Their actions overlap, interests conflict, and thus, the story is born.\n\nMoreover, dialogues are also put together very well, it really shows. \nWhen talking / describing a situation, characters are trying to cover all possible critique coming from player and explain their reasoning, so there will be no (or very little) unanswered \"Why didn't you do %that% instead?\" questions on your behalf.\n\nCharacters also have distinct personalities, and they are not in a hurry to just dump all information from character sheet on you, you need to ask questions (or not, just like with people around in \"meatspace\")\n\nThe pacing of game also matches a pace you expect from events of the story, so there is no dissonances on this part.\n\nPlot twists: KOJIMA / 10\n\nThat's good writing for you.\n\nAs for gameplay aspects, like in every good point'n'click game, you are not so much \"solving puzzles\", as \"managing situations\", and there is often more than one way to resolve your problems (It is mirrored by achievements, which is nice)\n\nOverall, it's a must have.\nTechnocrat Games clearly should be more proud of their creation and make better publicity for Technobabylon and future games.\n\nP.S.

Three viewpoint characters you swap between at plot points (two cops with biosci PHD's, and a jobless net addict), one of whom happens to be trans -- an interesting throw-away detail that doesn't define the character.\n\nThemes include AI, surveilance, and a little bit about the definition of consciousness.

No offence meant to Wadjet Eye, but I'd played several of their games previously, including the Blackwell series and The Shivah, and found them kind-of-sort-of-OK - my main criticism being that they were *far* too short; as soon as the story even starts to get going, the game is suddenly over. Point and clicks are such a story driven genre that getting immersed in a great, involved story is, I feel, a vital factor.\n\nOn this, Technobabylon delivers in spades. There's probably a good 15 hours of epic adventuring (if you even have the vaguest interest in talking to characters and exploring the world) and they're a great 15 hours.\n\n[b] Pros [/b]\n+ Far better sound quality than previous Wadjet Eye games (Curious NB: In the commentary, Dave Gilbert - the company's 'big cheese' - says that this was the first time they used a professional voice recording studio rather than his house, and that the difference was palpable, although this was in the quality of the voice acting and that you'd probably only notice the difference in sound if you were an 'audiophile' - gotta say, I am nowhere near an 'audiophile', but the difference in sound quality of the dialogue in this is leaps and bounds ahead of the quality in the Blackwell games.)\n+ Decent voice acting (and lots of it - great if you like lots of opportunity to explore characters and their reactions to the world)\n+ As I have mentioned, great length, allowing you to get lost in the story, and also providing great value for the price. If you want to 100% the achievements, you'll be playing even longer\n+ Elements of choice - not a lot, but they were there, and that's relatively rare for a P&C\n+ Interesting concepts and setting\n+ Despite it being pixel art, it was quite beautiful in places\n+ Fantastic, logical puzzles - you're unlikely to need a walkthrough if you persevere just a little\n+ You get to play as several different characters which kept it interesting from chapter to chapter\n+ Almost no backtracking as your set of locations changes each chapter (pretty much), meaning solving even the toughest puzzles is more do-able because you do not have to wander round 50 different screens trying to combine items with 100s of things\n+ Interactive items are highlighted on screen so no pixel hunting.\n\n[b] Cons [/b]\n- Why, oh why, must the characters waaaaalllllllk soooooo sloooooooowlllllly?

You will love the first half hour or even the first hour depending on how long the initial puzzle takes you however any sense of this being a game for adults swiftly flies out the window by the second chapter. \n\n*Potential spoiler*\n\nIn the comments below reviewers are making claims such as the \"good voice acting\" or \"impressive story line with interesting characters\" and....for the life of me I cannot comprehend how. In the three hours that I played I was introduced to three archetypes that were neither interesting or unique in any fashion. I lost faith in the \"fleshed out characters\" when a man fell from the sky and landed on a nearby car outside to which my characters calmly looked at the body made a few offhand remarks about how odd that was and proceeded to discuss the next objective. It could be argued that since the \"Omnipresent\" AI controls so much of the city that even sudden murder is viewed with an almost apathetic reaction but the game does little to give the player any sense of immersion or backstory for this to be believed. The dialogue is poorly spoken and the characters are bland cardboard cliches.\n\nThis being said, I will admit that the interactions with some of the computer programs was genuinely fascinating and fulfilling. It is a sad state when the only enjoyable moments in the game come from the various AI interactions with panels and programs then with the actual human characters. \n\nRereading the description I feel I should have known better.\n\nA cyberpunk adventure game from the studio that brought you Gemini Rue and Blackwell! The year is 2087. Genetic engineering is the norm, and an omnipresent AI powers the city. Take control of three citizens of this world as they struggle to understand a deadly conspiracy.\n\nAn exclamation point and the phrase \"generic engineering is the norm.\" \n\nI was not going into this game expecting novel trilogy building depth but if you are going to make a puzzle adventure game (and I am using the phrase puzzle lightly here) then you must make people care about what is happening and build a sense of interest in the characters. \n\nTL;DR \nRetro graphics cover up bland story with horrible voice acting and cliche story.

Easily amongst the best modern point-and-clicks I've played, and good enough to hold its own with the classics too. Its engaging story is bolstered by stellar worldbuilding that strikes the perfect balance between drowning the player in backstory vs giving them nothing outisde the main narrative. You get to delve deep into many aspects of the dystopian cyberpunk future that the game weaves around you, but there are plenty of things that are only mentioned or implied. This dichotomy makes the game/world feel much larger than it actually is, which is a rare trick in this age of exposition heavy Wiki-oriented games. The end result of the narrative and worldbuilding is a game that you won't want to stop playing, and I was a little sad when I completed it just because I knew that was all I'd get to see of this world.\n\nThat said, it does have the same flaws as many other games of its type. Sometimes you won't be able to parse what the designer expects you to do next. Other times you'll overlook an interactable object and spend a good 15 minutes furiously trying everything in your inventory on all the interactable points until you realize you missed something. You'll be able to get hints from NPCs to help you past some of these issues, but they're still present and can be annoying when trying to complete the game without a walkthrough. I think it's worth noting that the hints were never immersion-breaking; the NPCs' advice always seemed to fit their characters and the situation at hand, rather than breaking the fourth wall and condescending to the player by practically telling them the solution.\n\nAll in all, this is a must-have for anyone who loves point-and-click or cyberpunk.

The game focuses on three people living in a futuristic city run by a central computer. There's Charles Regis, an agent of CEL, which acts as a police force within the city, his partner Max Lao, and trance addict/hacker Latha Sesame. The three become entangled in an intricate plot involving part secrets, intricate histories, and unique technologies. The game separates itself from typical sci-fi by giving it's technology a bizzare form of organic technology, ala David Cronenberg, in which computers come from an organic source. And while the story may have an immense amount of dizzying technical detail, what truly separates it is the way in which it is played. Yes, it adheres to much of the usual point-click style, but it breaks this up by including some interesting game elements and making use of it's technological setting. At certain points, you'll control drones, be able to play minigames, and access a network hub. Things are kept fresh by giving you different kinds of environments to play in and different tools to use. All the characters are fairly well developed, though they aren't necessarily all that original.

With its \nthought-provoking story and themes, engaging characters, and its incredible use of pixelated graphics, Technobabylon proves that the point-and-click genre is alive, well, and growing artistically.\n\nThe story of Technobabylon is intriguing, and also told out of order from different points of view. This keeps the player engaged and shows the incredible depth of the world that the game takes place in. While it falls in the realm of science fiction, I feel that the game takes place in the not so distant future, considering how quickly technology is advancing. Not only is there a great story, but there are a variety of themes and ideas that could provoke thoughtful discussion. As society advances, the importance of family, the increase in scientific power and how much license mankind should take, and the dangers of embracing a virtual world while forsaking the responsibilities of the real world are all examined. This is a game that tackles a number of social issues that are relevant today, as well as what could possibly be achieved in the future. \n\nThe characters of this game are well fleshed out and acted. In Technobabylon, we follow three main protagonists, Dr. Charles Regis, a genetic engineer with a past; Max Lao, his tech savvy partner;  and Latha Sesame, a young woman who would rather live in a virtual world than face the harshness of reality. All the performances in this game are top notch, with great writing throughout. \n\nFinally, the star of the game is how beautiful it is. Pixelated art never looked so good. The stunning backgrounds and gritty atmosphere really give the game depth. The techno music is a \nperfect fit for the gorgeous and gritty city. \n\nPoint-and-click games have come a long way from the obtuse puzzles and nonsensical solutions that they are known for. Technobabylon's puzzles feel more like continuing an investigation. While puzzles may take more thought, they are not difficult. There are also instances where there are multiple solutions to a puzzle or situation. This game should be replayed in order to see all the different outcomes. There is also the ability to hack into different electronics, which almost feels like breaking the fourth wall, as one is able to effortlessly phase in and out of the virtual world.\n\nTechnobabylon is a great and creative game that should not be missed by those who love science fiction and a great story. This game educates as well as entertains. I look forward to more from Technocrat Games, and can understand fully why Wadjet Eye would want to publish this game. Its great story, memorable characters, and stunning sights and sounds prove that the point-and-click \ngenre is still worthy of attention and excitement.", "timestamp_created": 1436861123, "timestamp_updated": 1436861366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.650537", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17035349": {"recommendationid": "17035349", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989390503", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436827635}, "language": "english", "review": "It pains me to give this game a thumbs down, because it's not a bad game at all. In fact, some aspects of it are superb, but I just -can't- recommend it. If Steam had a neutral option, I would've picked that. For now, I have to regretfully give a thumbs down.\n\nThe cyberpunk setting the game has is amazing. I could really connect with the characters. Their motivations were clear, and the decisions they faced were well-executed. The whole story was put together well and kept the intrigue going, apart from maybe the big plot twist, which I saw coming from a mile away, and when it was revealed, it only left me disappointed that there wasn't more to it than what I already figured out.\n\nI also really like the old-school pixelated art style. The art is beautiful. Most notable were the character portraits. Brilliant artwork. The voice acting was also really well done. \n\nSo, a great story, beautiful art, and solid voice acting. Why the thumbs down? Well, just like most point and click games, this game suffers from convoluted puzzles that often make no logical sense, and at times even require you to have the knowledge of how things in the game's fictional setting work, like wetware or trance. Don't get me wrong - some of the puzzles were fun and executed well, but many others require you to have a walkthrough on hand, especially in the last two chapters. It just horribly breaks the pace of the story.\n\nThe game also offers some choices. It was a great touch, though many don't seem to make much of a difference to the story. I was especially annoyed by the ending, which I shall outline in the spoiler below (read at your own risk!):\n[spoiler] The ending had me choose to either side with the A.I. or side with the power-hungry woman (Nina Jeung). I chose to side with the A.I. and to give it full control of the city, and yet, the A.I ended up somehow getting under Nina's control, even though I specifically chose not to side with her. These kind of false choices really ruin potentially good stories. What was the point of giving me this choice when the outcome is almost the same? [/spoiler]\n\nSo to conclude, although I enjoyed a lot of parts of the game, it left me feeling disappointed, and hence I can't with all honesty recommend the game. If you don't mind the outlandish puzzles that will force you to consult a walkthrough, then by all means, get the game.

From the atmospheric opening credits to the tumultuous ending, this game is packed full of originality and atmosphere. In Technobabylon, you play the role of two disenfranchised citizens in the sprawling metropolis of Newton. The year is 2087 and the entire city is controlled by an all-seeing, all-knowing artificial intelligence known as \u2018Central.\u2019\n\nCharlie Regis, an old-school detective with a background in human engineering and a poverty-stricken young woman named Latha Sesame with an addiction to the \u2018trance\u2019 (a kind of futuristic, full-sensory internet) serve as our protagonists. Charlie does not trust Central to the point that he regularly covers up the camera in his office under the pretence that it is malfunctioning. His appreciation for privacy and his belief in the human side of police work make him something of an odd-ball in a city which simply accepts the convenience of rule by AI. He serves as the plot\u2019s moral compass, especially when compared to his partner, Max Lao, who embraces the complexity of technology in all of its forms. Similarly, Latha Sesame is an expert at the use of the trance, a kind of state of meditation which allows humans to physically interact with computers and technology through the use of an organic material known as \u2018wetware.\u2019\n\nIf I\u2019m making the plot of Technobabylon sound complex that\u2019s because it is, but the game presents it in such a way that it becomes easy to digest. Take, for example, the concept of the \u2018trance.\u2019 The opening puzzle shows the player exactly how this works when Latha is unable to leave her apartment due to a power cut. She must then utilize her abilities to trance with the various AIs which control the objects in her room. One of them is a security obsessed anti-virus program, designed with the personality of a medieval knight. The other is an annoyingly chirpy, anime-inspired computer chef named \u2018Cheffie\u2019, responsible for cooking and preparing meals for the inhabitants of all apartments in the city. These AIs become some of the most entertaining and ultimately compelling characters in the game and in truth, I was left feeling that Technobabylon could have explored this idea further. There are other AIs in the game but not nearly as many as I had hoped for and that early promise was, to a certain extent, never delivered upon. But in truth, I\u2019m nit-picking.\n\nDespite suffering from the often convoluted style of puzzle-design that seems to have dogged the point-and-click genre forever, Technobabylon\u2019s puzzles are usually tough but fair. However, where the game really shines is in its presentation of the city of Newton and its inhabitants. The colossal sky-line flanking the highway as Charlie\u2019s patrol car speeds to its next destination, the incorporeal cyber-bar where trance-addicted techno-junkies meet to anonymously dance and play computer games, the dilapidated, graffiti-ridden factories of an abandoned district of the city. All these locations come together to create the impression of a living, breathing city, a city that you believe could really exist sixty years from now. This is aided in no small part by the excellent, ambient soundtrack which, for me, was very reminiscent of the original Deus Ex\u2019s score.\n\nThe plot is brilliantly original, especially in the already bloated cyberpunk genre, a genre which Wadjet Eye have already explored in 2011\u2019s \u2018Gemini Rue.\u2019 But where Gemini Rue\u2019s World felt oppressive, claustrophobic and ultimately constrictive, the city of Newton feels open and is presented as a bastion of liberal thinking and left-wing acceptance, all the while giving you the impression that this image might just be merely another tool for control of the populace. Valtaire\u2019s famous statement that \u201cit is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere\u201d springs instantly to mind and this subversion of the old cyberpunk clich\u00e9 of a right-wing government being obviously evil and brutally oppressive is a real breathe of fresh air.\n\nTechnobabylon is definitely a game for fans of the genre. If you\u2019re looking for non-stop action and intense gameplay then you won\u2019t find it here. But chances are, unless you\u2019re a Victorian time traveller who has never played a computer game before, you already knew that. Solid puzzles, beautiful level design, decent voice acting and a constantly intriguing plot make Technobabylon an adventure well worth embarking on and at just $14.99/\u00a310.99 it is also an adventure which won\u2019t break your wallet.\n", "timestamp_created": 1436442713, "timestamp_updated": 1436442713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16951897": {"recommendationid": "16951897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019345891", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436406787}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly? Most people coming to play Technobabylon are coming from the game Gemini Rue, so I'll explain it sort of from that viewpoint. If you haven't played Gemini Rue, it's pretty similar to this game, although quite a bit more interesting.\n\nGameplay is, as one would expect, nil. There are a few small puzzles and lots of random desperate clicking around-- but, for the most part, it's an interactive story; similar to something you'd find made by Telltale games, except you don't really have freedom of choice other than the somewhat-literal deus ex machina at the end of the game. This is not an inherently bad thing, but DOES mean that high expectations are held for the game's story, which is where things start to fall flat.\n\nThe story, in a similar manner to Gemini Rue, is focused around the lives of three characters-- and none of them are particularly interesting. We've got an infertile genre-required police detective under blackmail, a transsexual tech-expert cop, and a 'trance-junkie' (who remains entirely unrelated to the other characters until the last ~10 minutes of gameplay), the 'trance' being a cheap knockoff of William Gibson's idea of 'cyberspace'; an idea that's been taken almost nowhere past its origins in the genre. The villains are also mostly uninteresting-- which is quite a turn-off.\n\nTechnobabylon piqued my interest, especially at the beginning, but really only left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Every time that I thought that the game was about to get better, it'd get worse-- whether because of boring puzzles or because of boring plot cliches.\n\nI'm not going to say that Technobabylon is a trainwreck, but it's certainly not worth the $15.", "timestamp_created": 1436408590, "timestamp_updated": 1436408590, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434925", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16873741": {"recommendationid": "16873741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076365408", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1094, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435546059}, "language": "english", "review": "Well worth the purchase if you love adventure games and dystopian sci-fi as much as I do.

Of them all, Technobabylon was easily the most enjoyable. The problems I had with the game feel minor, like some voice actors overacting, or how the text is written when you examine objects. These issues were blotted out by the mysteries, the music, the audio design, and puzzles with multiple solutions. I just loved \u201cbeing in the world\u201d, to whatever extent that\u2019s possible in a point-and-click. It was a nice place to be in, even before the first line of the game was spoken. I saw it, I heard it, and I knew I liked it. That propelled me through the opening of the game until the story kicked off in proper and hooked me completely.\n\nCompared to Primordia, Technobabylon\u2019s story lacks depth. It goes for a less subtle and more action heavy approach. More thrills, more instant gratification, and no confusion. This approach works, as it succeeds in actually being thrilling, and makes it hard to put down. Because of this, I find Technobabylon easy to recommend. It\u2019s unlikely anyone is going to be bored by it. It\u2019s fairly long for a point-and-click adventure, but the superb pacing makes it feel half its length.

Evidentemente no son los presupuestos actuales de las peque\u00f1as empresas los mismos que ten\u00edan las grandes compa\u00f1\u00edas que he nombrado, ni est\u00e1 el g\u00e9nero tan de moda como lo estuvo en la d\u00e9cada de los 90, pero salvando algunos detalles t\u00e9cnicos uno dir\u00eda que no han pasado los a\u00f1os, sensaci\u00f3n acrecentada en parte por el aspecto tradicional de los gr\u00e1ficos en baja resoluci\u00f3n, tan parecidos a los de Simon The Sorcerer, Legend of Kyrandia o cualquier otro t\u00edtulo de los que asentaron el g\u00e9nero aventurero.\n\nWadjet Eye Games producen sus propios juegos, como los de la serie Blackwell, pero tambi\u00e9n se dedican a poner el dinero para publicar los de otras peque\u00f1as compa\u00f1\u00edas. Este es el caso de Technobabylon, que originalmente era un juego gratuito por cap\u00edtulos, obra de los independientes Technocrat. El trabajo de los responsables de Wadjet Eye Games, como en las ocasiones anteriores, ha consistido en un remozado gr\u00e1fico y el doblaje de los protagonistas, en lineas generales. El resultado, para que nos entiendan las personas familiarizadas con estos juegos, le da a la aventura un aspecto similar al de las anteriores publicaciones de la casa.\n\nAunque cuenta con alguna excepci\u00f3n, a estas alturas podemos decir que Wadjet Eyes Games se ha especializado en el tema fant\u00e1stico, tocando varias vertientes. Mientras la serie Blackwell mezcla el g\u00e9nero detectivesco con el espiritismo, hay varios juegos de la compa\u00f1\u00eda que entran en la definici\u00f3n de ciencia ficci\u00f3n. En Gemini Rue, por ejemplo, el g\u00e9nero negro se funde con el punk y en Primordia nos encontramos con un space opera, mientras que en Resonance el thriller tiene vahos tecnol\u00f3gicos. Technobabylon nos devuelve al cyberpunk de una forma m\u00e1s concreta, pues cuenta con una variedad de ingredientes que podr\u00edamos encontrar perfectamente en una novela de William Gibson o Bruce Sterling, considerados exponentes del g\u00e9nero. Pong\u00e1monos en situaci\u00f3n. Un argumento criminal, un gui\u00f3n enrevesado con diversos protagonistas que se acaban relacionando, un escenario dist\u00f3pico en el que los ciudadanos de una megal\u00f3polis futurista y decadente mantienen una lucha de clases, y lo m\u00e1s importante de todo: La gente se conecta al ciberespacio mediante una red neuronal, lo que nos remite y refiere inmediatamente a las novelas Count Zero o Neuromancer, del citado Gibson. A\u00f1ada todo esto a la coctelera de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas y con un poquito de imaginaci\u00f3n tendr\u00e1 una idea de qu\u00e9 es Technobabylon.\n\n \n\nSupongo que hasta ahora a algunos lectores les puede sonar estupendo este breve resumen de Technobabylon, pero analicemos el juego con detenimiento. Por lo que se refiere al cyberpunk, los acontecimientos transcurren por el derrotero que un aficionado al g\u00e9nero esperar\u00eda, incluyendo una cantidad de di\u00e1logos m\u00e1s bien extensa para lo que las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas nos suelen ofrecer. Esto no significa que todas las conversaciones nos encaminen a diversas consecuencias o incluso a un callej\u00f3n sin salida, seg\u00fan las respuestas escogidas, como podr\u00eda ser el caso de un Monkey Island.\n\nEn Technobabylon la mayor\u00eda de los textos son expositivos y sirven para dar consistencia al argumento. La selecci\u00f3n de una opci\u00f3n u otra solamente nos lleva, en la mayor\u00eda de las ocasiones, a conocer m\u00e1s detalles de los protagonistas o del universo antiut\u00f3pico que se pretende retratar, pudiendo escoger a continuaci\u00f3n otras respuestas para seguir avanzando con los distintos di\u00e1logos, ahondando en el conocimiento de los personajes, en ciertos detalles de su pasado, sus relaciones afectivas o de trabajo y la visi\u00f3n que tienen de la sociedad en la que viven.\n\n\nS\u00ed que existen en determinadas ocasiones algunas alternativas que nos permiten resolver los problemas de modos distintos, aunque inmediatamente nos vuelven a conducir a la trama principal, que es b\u00e1sicamente lineal. Mi cr\u00edtica, en cambio, no se refiere a la rigidez del argumento, cuesti\u00f3n sobre la que no tengo nada que objetar siempre que \u00e9ste sea suficientemente s\u00f3lido e interesante, sino al poco provecho que se saca del aspecto audiovisual del juego para sumergirnos en la historia y narrarnos los acontecimientos. Tenemos los decorados habituales del cyberpunk, ciertamente, con sus ciudadanos babeantes adictos a la red, los cuchitriles de la clase obrera y un poco de violencia expl\u00edcita, pero es que en Technobabylon nos enteramos de casi todo lo que ocurre a trav\u00e9s de los di\u00e1logos y explicaciones de los protagonistas, muchos de ellos excesivamente largos y algunos impostados, a\u00f1adidos a la fuerza para explicar las circunstancias de la escena y las motivaciones de los personajes. Pienso que se ha perdido una buena ocasi\u00f3n de narrar los acontecimientos usando una est\u00e9tica visual y sonora m\u00e1s vanguardista, con el objetivo de maridar lo que se cuenta con la forma de hacerlo.\n\nIndependientemente del recurso de la saturaci\u00f3n de los textos, la trama recurre a los clich\u00e9s del cyberpunk que enumeraba anteriormente, llevados con un ritmo desigual y con m\u00e1s acierto en algunos casos que en otros. En ciertas ocasiones el gui\u00f3n hace agua por su simpleza, casi de novela adolescente, con un protagonista principal que da lecciones de moralina en vez de dejar que el propio jugador extraiga sus conclusiones, aunque se compensa con otros momentos acertados que nos devuelven la tensi\u00f3n y el inter\u00e9s. En su conjunto Technobabylon consiste en una repetici\u00f3n de situaciones e ideas ya conocidas por cualquier aficionado del cine o la literatura cyberpunk, al que pueden satisfacer o arrancar una sonrisa c\u00f3mplice por el homenaje que suponen al g\u00e9nero, pero a las que veo faltas de atrevimiento e innovaci\u00f3n, sobre todo trat\u00e1ndose de un estilo al que se le supone rompedor y subversivo. Todo acaba transcurriendo seg\u00fan lo previsto. Demasiado, cuando lo que uno demanda de la subversi\u00f3n es que sorprenda y escandalice, no solamente por lo que se refiere al argumento, sino tambi\u00e9n a la comunicaci\u00f3n sonora y visual.\n\nEn cuanto a los puzles, que suelen ser el recurso de mayor peso en las aventuras tradicionales, los autores han optado por el clasicismo con todo lo que eso implica, sin aportar nada realmente novedoso y que hubiera estado en consonancia con una aventura futurista. Lo \u00fanico que podemos destacar es la inclusi\u00f3n del ciberespacio, en el que tambi\u00e9n se han de resolver algunos acertijos, pero por lo dem\u00e1s todo funciona con el tradicional m\u00e9todo de recoger objetos para usarlos directamente en el escenario o combinados entre s\u00ed. Esto no es un defecto en s\u00ed mismo, pues no lo puede ser una mec\u00e1nica que nos ha dado tantos buenos juegos, pero como los puzles no son excepcionales o maquiav\u00e9licos, am\u00e9n que los objetos se usan siempre en las inmediaciones de donde los descubrimos, nos encontramos ante un videojuego que reparte sus virtudes entre el argumento y la resoluci\u00f3n de enigmas a partes iguales, aunque distando de la excelencia en ambos casos.\n\nDicho esto, no quiero decir que Technobabylon sea un juego rampl\u00f3n, ni por asomo. En realidad me ha parecido una aventura digna, con un buen arranque y una parte final meritoria, bastante divertida en general y destacable, que recomiendo sin dudarlo a cualquier aficionado del cyberpunk. [...] Se vuelve a quedar por debajo de las obras superlativas que fueron Resonance y Gemini Rue.

It must be me and my diet of modern hold-your-hand grade 5 logic puzzles, and shoot-pointblank-don't-think FPS's, but it took me a while to figure out a few of the challenges. That's not really a bad thing, as the puzzles are (mostly fun) and very creative in thought and execution (the CI program on the synths ensures hilarity), and overall, it's a refreshing experience for cerebral activity in their gaming. Just be prepared to use the noggin! ;)\n\nCharacters are mostly cliche-free ridden, with talented but vulnerable Latha, transgender protagonist Max (a minor but still notable detail), and \"old-man\" technophobe Charlie, a Texan who finds himself caught in a situation he doesn't want involving his deceased Sri-Lankan wife. In fact, very noticeable are the diverse and different ethnicities and characters; again it's something new and different in media. (Heck, the setting of fiction Newton city is India, not \"New York,\" or even LA!!)\n\nThe music sets the world mood excellently. From the calming sooth and placid feel of escapist Trance lobbys, to dour, gritty feel of investigate megacity murder, the audio matches the setting, tone, and pace mirroring the on screen action.\n\nThe writing is wry and writty; sardonic Max makes one sarcastic quip after the next, and Charlie has his own way of handling things, as does Latha, but really, so do all characters, major and minor alike, with a writing humorous style in  constant flow. On note of the characters, the voice acting is quite impressive, with characters carrying the wit and humor far, and giving some mostly convincing dramatics. The narrative engages, and the plot catches, though listen and pay careful attention to the narrative earlier than later, otherwise you'll miss a few things, as well as some \"oh wow!\" story revelations. \n\nI can tell that it was a small studio (probably very small actually) that made TB, but there was a lot of love and care put into it and it shows. The game is very charming, and in the days of 4K res, 60fps, blah, blah, it at least gathers an unhealthy, grimy ambience to the entire cyberpunk setting. One other thing to appreciate, despite the small studio size, Technobabylon retains from feeling like a tiny indie game with peesy commercial value. Give or take a few noticable modern things, if this was back in the day and you'd said a big studio made it, I'd have swallowed it in one go.\n\nSome minor gripes: one puzzle involving a crime scene you stumble into is particularly hard to solve because of a particular items lack of visibility. I quite stumbled onto it by accident, but this could have been spelt out a little better. Another thing, at times the narrative and plot convolutions are hard to follow. Truthfully though, since when was cyberpunk known for ease of rite, accessibility, clarity and understanding? TB's narrative clunks are all intentional right? XD\n\nSo where does that leave us?\n\nIf you're a cyberpunk aficionado, love classic pointers, and like engaging logic puzzles (relative to the brain drizzle on today's market), you'd be a nob to ignore Technobablyon.\n\nThis was my first Wadjet Eye Games game, and I'm definitely checking out the rest of their catalogue. \n\nFinal verdict? For general gamers, 9/10, but for point click adventurers/cyberpunk fans, a definite 10/10.\n\nBuy this game, and enjoy!!", "timestamp_created": 1432835878, "timestamp_updated": 1433012695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489510", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16018804": {"recommendationid": "16018804", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971450042", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1085, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432686044}, "language": "english", "review": "Im an 80s kid.

Games like Technobabylon are not only scarce, they are worth gold. I knew when i saw the Title of the game it would be exactly what i wanted. And after installing the game and seeing the menu for the first time, hearing the music, i knew that GTA V would have to wait. All my games would have to wait. It's been an amazing 18 hours.  Even if i tried i couldnt praise the game enough. The Art and Music direction already puts this apart from most Adventure Quest games.  But the story just makes it unforgettable. It pulled me in and kept me fully immersed in the City of Newton and it's inhabitants. Just please, do yourself a favour, and get this game if you are serious about old school quest adventure games with a good plot, full voice acting for all characters you get to play and meet, yes, you play multiple people, a great sound track, well written dialogue, and clever puzzles.

It is one of the most complex and captivating games I've played in a long time and if you're a fan of point and click games or just love the Cyberpunk genre; it's an absolute essential purchase. \n\nThe game takes place in 2087 in the City of Newton -  an AI run City where genetic engineering dominates humanity and an online Trance craze has taken over society where human interaction plays secondary to online communication. The City is also ran by CEL - the Police, who see and control everything. The conspiracy-driven narrative follows the story of three playable characters;- Charlie Regis a CEL agent and his case officer partner Max Lao along with Latha Sesame; a jobless Trance addict who spends her time fixed in a fantasy online world as opposed to the heavily controlled Newton. After a spate of bombings in the city and a criminal on the run who steals people's memories - the 'Mindjacker'; the game flourishes into a sublime and depth-ridden tale of corruption and intrigue. Elaborating any further would be a huge spoiler but it is simply an incredibly well crafted narrative that is extremely thought-provoking and powerful. \n\nThe general gameplay is similar to that of classics in the genre and modern titles alike such as Blade Runner and Gemini Rue. It's a puzzle-oriented point and click adventure with some very difficult and well-designed puzzles. Some have been very smartly implemented and can often leave you feeling confused and hapless. The satisfaction when you solve a problem and progress a wonderful feeling though as well as earning achievements. Voice acting is also present and is supported by some very appropriate music that adds to the amazing atmosphere. The writing is also very impressive with many clever fictional futuristic aspects being added that brings intrigue and understanding what happened in the past. Some of the script terminologies are very complex though and users sometimes have to decipher and guess what the game is talking about as some things aren't explained clearly. You will gradually understand everything as your progress though, as the narrative begins to fall into place and terms are elaborated in greater detail. \n\nOverall; Technobabylon is one of the best games I've played this year and another massive success for WadgetEye Games and Steam debut developer Technocrat. The game is complex, challenging, engaging and a remarkable experience throughout. It will take 12-15 hours to finish and with plenty of achievements on offer; there is certainly replay value here also.

The design stretches beyond the main story to fill out a fascinating version of the future. The switching between characters, reminiscent of Wadjet Eye's equally impressive Resonance, gives you multiple perspectives on the city of Newton, which comes alive through implicit storytelling - filling in history and culture without dense exposition. Well-written dialogue develops naturally from the characters and is often very inventive, with no opportunity for embellishing the world squandered. \n\nThe puzzles are well integrated into the story and fun, sometimes offering multiple paths to the solution - and eventually multiple endings. Artwork is more exceptional pixel-mastery from Wadjet Eye regular Ben Chandler, coherent and consistent design with great use of teal/orange colour scheme. Sound is a weaker aspect, with the music being competent but not memorable, and the quality of voice acting dipping significantly for some side characters.\n\nAll-in-all, another reason to give Wadjet Eye your money: 9/10\n\nPros: Creative puzzles, interesting and diverse characters, great artwork, immersive world, top quality writing, great value for money  \n\nCons: Uneven voice acting outside of main cast, a little buggy as of writing this (had to restart game occasionally to fix problem with instantly closing description boxes)", "timestamp_created": 1432382583, "timestamp_updated": 1432382583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605420", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15964612": {"recommendationid": "15964612", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994782386", "num_games_owned": 779, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432444172}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430! \n\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0432 \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u043a\u0438\u0431\u0435\u0440\u043f\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430 - \u0441 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0438\u0440\u0442\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e, \u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043a \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043c \u043d\u0430 6-10 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0442\u0449\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430.\n\n\u041f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0442 Wadjet Eye Games \u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0435\u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u044b\u0434\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0439.\n\n\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0438\u044f: http://itc.ua/articles/technobabylon-divnyiy-novyiy-mir/", "timestamp_created": 1432382505, "timestamp_updated": 1432382505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633507", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15963860": {"recommendationid": "15963860", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025124053", "num_games_owned": 596, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432307884}, "language": "english", "review": "Technobabylon is a point and click adventure that isn\u2019t afraid to get deep into some complicated themes while remaining well written, consistent and above all fun to play.\n\nThe sheer number of ideas running through game is amazing, and the fact that everything gets pulled back together to give a satisfying conclusion with no loose ends is nothing short of a masterstroke from Technocrat Games. Characters are deep, with real personalities, secrets, desires and resentments. Even the \u2018synthetic\u2019 characters are better written than many supposedly human characters in other games. The forces of good in the game have dark sides to them, and the antagonists are not simply evil for the sake of it; there\u2019s no moustache twirling and maniacal laughter here. Everything happens for a reason, and the reasons are damn good ones!\n\nThe art is really nice (it's Ben Chandler), and the voice acting is better than average too, with some great personalities in there.

Also there were some points in the story that was really unexpected for me, but if you will play the game you will see what I meant. :)\n\nThe game is obvious a point'n'click adventure, so it has puzzle to progress and overall they aren't that hard, but sometimes you probably will get stuck, because you overlook some thing like I did.\nAlso at some points of the game you have more than one option to accomplish your goal, which also results in a point, where your decision will change the end of the game. \n\nSo if you like point'n'click adventures with a good story, you won't make a mistake for buying this game.

The only Wadjet Eye game that's longer is Resonance.\n\nWhen it comes to character chemistry, your mileage may vary. The voice acting direction feels pretty loose - as if the majority of it was intended for a Blackwell game.

People can\u2019t find jobs because most services are automated by a singular computer system named, Central. Humans are raised by the city and molded by it, they can either become successful or sponges trapped in the thrall of the internet.  There are some high notes in there like acceptable gene manipulation from man to woman, and racial hatred seems to be a thing of the past. However zealotry, hacking, government spying, war, and terrorism have all gotten worse than we can ever imagine.\n\nTechnobabylon bounces between many distinct characters similar to the film \u201cCrash.\u201d The story revolves around the actions of a shady group of criminals who manipulate a police officer into making some questionable choices, and the attempted termination of an otherwise uninteresting woman living in the slums. The mystery goes beyond those two and slips into the lives of other citizens in the city, as each layer is peeled from this clandestine group.\n\nHigh points\n\nDeep and engrossing \u2013 Technobabylon is a well-written cyberpunk adventure game with a knack for fleshing out its world via descriptive storytelling. For a game that looks like it was made in the early 90\u2019s, it comes to life with witty dialogue, interesting characters, and believable explanations of technology that would impress William Gibson. It easily articulates the impact of humans allowing technological advances to get out of control and effectively rule them.\n\nIt paints a picture of a future full of genetic-manipulation, synthetic love, curable diseases, news outlets corrupted by corporations, and wars that are waged not just on the ground but also in the mind. If this were a novel, it could easily be a best seller among the Science-Fiction crowd.\n\nFun characters and puzzles \u2013 Charlie and the gang, will interact with some interesting programs and synthetics in the city. I thought I had accidently turned on Discworld or Monkey Island after interacting with the various wacky programs in and out of the Trance. Most of the characters can be outright hilarious amongst an otherwise grim world. The interactions are only highlighted by intelligent puzzle design that refuses to force us into spamming random objects. The title gives plenty of hints to allow us to look at a situation logically, understand it, and complete the puzzle.\n\nLatha can interact with terminals and drift into the Trance to use programs and manipulation to hack the internet. Charlie and Max will find reasonable ways to discover clues, and hack into the brains of synthetics to twist their personalities to something more helpful. As much as I love The Walking Dead, I think this game properly demonstrates how to create meaningful gameplay, while also providing us with a stimulating tale.\n\nHard Choices & Cold Outcomes \u2013 While it\u2019s nothing like Mass Effect in terms of sheer volume of decision making, each of the available choices are not to be selected on a whim. No matter how well intentioned a choice may be, it is always countered by a consequence. You may not feel the immediate sting of what you\u2019ve done, but eventually the game will let you understand the weight of it. This game doesn\u2019t mind making you feel like a terrible person after your judgment calls.\n\nVisual Discrepancy \u2013 In the early build that I\u2019ve played, I\u2019ve noticed that the visuals take a jarring leap between clean 16-bit graphics in the trance, and grimy looking pixels in the \u201creal\u201d world. I\u2019m sure this is a stylistic choice by the development team, and I respect them for it, but it comes off as a bit jarring. I also noticed that characters are always speaking in the Trance, but in the real world their lips will only move in special sequences. It\u2019s a small issue that dilutes the atmosphere of this otherwise immersive world.\n\nLow Points\n\nTechnical Issues \u2013 There are a few bugs in the build I played but nothing that negatively affected gameplay. I did notice that the game crashes trying to Alt-Tab, or refuses to even start if you have a multi-monitor setup. I did notice that the game stopped Auto-saving on some levels, so be sure to manually save when you can. Hopefully all these issues will be ironed out by the time the game releases.\n\nConclusion\n\nTechnobabylon may not be a visual and technical marvel, but the story and immersive dialogue creates a believable Science Fiction world. If you\u2019re a fan of cyberpunk books or the classic Blade Runner film, you\u2019ll absolutely adore the detailed and brutal storyline of Technobabylon. I recommend that you buy this game at full price if you\u2019re an adventure fan, or even if you\u2019re a person that just loves great storytelling. Technocrat and Wadjet Eye Games did a fantastic job, and I still can\u2019t believe these are the same people that made a game called \u201cNancy: The Happy Whore.\u201d\n\n*A review copy was provided to us by the publisher*", "timestamp_created": 1432230179, "timestamp_updated": 1432230375, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462331", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15928875": {"recommendationid": "15928875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055041003", "num_games_owned": 856, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440380412}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]DISCLAIMER:[/b] This review is based on a review copy provided by Wadjet Eye Games. It is completely true and unmanipulated, yet highly subjective from someone who loves adventure games in general and the WEG adventures so far in particular.\n\nTechnobabylon is, depending on your preferred taste in setting, the best Point & Click adventure Wadjet Eye Games ever put on the market. It can only be surpassed by the complete Blackwell experience if you like the ghost story more than Cyberpunk. Technobabylon easily snatches the summit of adventure games away from even the highly praised Gemini Rue, and a welcome release for everyone disappointed by Broken Ages final release.\n\nWith this out of the way, I\u2019ll try to get into the positive points without destroying the experience trough spoilers. Technobabylon takes place in Newton, a clich\u00e9 Cyberpunk City in the 21th century. It\u2019s controlled by a sentient AI called Central who not only manages electricity and water but also the police. In this town, a between-jobs internet addict and two high-ranking police officers get sucked into a mass murderer case that seems to rip the information out of their victims brains. In the end, one might find that the whole clich\u00e9 Newton presents is not quite what it seemed, and Technobabylon might have played with your expectations all along\u2026\n\nThe graphics are superb \u2013 if you like the characteristic artstyle of Ben Chandlers, who\u2019s responsible for all of Wadjet Eyes graphics. The game, while not being developed but only published by WEG received much help from Ben in terms of style, that is for certain. The animations are a little stiff while walking, but the gestures and animations of characters in dialogues are great and really set the mood. The music is alright \u2013 nothing fancy, but fitting for the black-and-neon world Newton provides.\n\nGameplay is very classic, but in a very refreshing way, especially for Wadjet Eye. While most of their earlier adventures have a focus on dialogues and riddles to progress the story, Technobabylon has a huge amount of item and inventory puzzles.This depends on the character you are currently controlling \u2013 the old techophobe police officer depends more on the good old use-fishing rod-with-magnet style of play than the internet addict who just hacks all systems she can get her hands on. This really helps differentiate the characters and is, plainly, really fun. The puzzles are very intuitive, though \u2013 no Grim Fandango \u201cHow the f\u2019 would I have guessed that moments\u201d in here. \n\nOverall, if you have the slightest interest in adventure games, go get Technobabylon. It\u2019s one of the best out there developed in modern times. \n\nMy German Review is found here: [url=http://www.gamingpoints.de/reviews/technobabylon-police-quest-am-adventure-gipfel/]Gamingpoints[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1432224907, "timestamp_updated": 1432224907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15928853": {"recommendationid": "15928853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014035044", "num_games_owned": 490, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432183437}, "language": "english", "review": "[url=http://techraptor.net/content/technobabylon-review-cybercity-adventures]TechRaptor Review[/url] \n\nWhile its gameplay is classic point and click, Technobabylon\u2019s writing, characters, and story are presented with a 21st century focus. The cyberpunk city of Newton is well-fleshed out and does an excellent job of providing coloration even on the parts you don\u2019t see. There are some relatively unique ideas, as well as some good implementations that help make it stand out in different ways.\n\nWhen it comes together, Technobablyon is a very nice adventure game with only a few flaws \u2013 the graphics sometimes don\u2019t quite work, the puzzles on a few occasions get away from logic, and the story has only a few points that make you frown on minor bits. However, it bears the trappings of its genre in many ways and that makes it a difficult game to score because if you aren\u2019t interested in adventure games, if you don\u2019t have patience, and you don\u2019t want to experience a well-written narrative where you solve puzzles on the go, it isn\u2019t something that will interest you.\n\nI will say though, if you like Adventure games, this is something you definitely want to check out!\n\n--- \nFinal Score: 7.5/10 Very Good\nRead the [url=http://techraptor.net/content/technobabylon-review-cybercity-adventures]full Review[/url] for more!", "timestamp_created": 1432224824, "timestamp_updated": 1432224824, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15928835": {"recommendationid": "15928835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016432675", "num_games_owned": 864, "num_reviews": 329, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451262330}, "language": "english", "review": "Game was looked at from a key obtained from the developer.\n\nTechnobabylon brings the experience of the old LucasArts games to the new day with updated themes and more modern social issues. The game hits themes of the Internet and the social stigma behind it, governmental control, and the human condition. The writing is pretty well done with strong work done in terms of the dialogue between characters, as you have reasons to actually listen to everyone and talk to them. The games puzzles are hit and miss. Some puzzles will make you feel like a real detective in how you solved the problem, and rewarded paying attention. Some puzzles on the other hands suffer from the old point + click adventures basic problem of not knowing exactly what it wants from you, and contextual item use. In the end, those who like sci-fi+control plots will really enjoy the experience that's here.\n\n+:\n[list]\n[*] Great dialogue work done here as the writing isn't forced, and flows naturally. Dialogue between characters plays to their personality strengths, and makes you want to find out what they have to say.\n[*] In addition, secondary dialogue and repeated dialogue options in particular were pretty fun to listen to, especially with the elements of the Trance in there. \n[*]Good variety of environments and made me appreciate the art style even more. Despite being set in the future, there was a great sense of difference within the world controlled by the AI.\n[*] The strongest puzzles in the game give a reasonable sense of accomplishment and a feeling of a real detective when completing them. \n[*] Some heavy themes are hit here, and some character depth really is brought to the forefront in terms of those themes. Emotional connections were strong in this game, especially if you have someone IRL you can relate to. \n[*] Solid voice acting all around (with an occassional misstep).\n[/list]\n\n-:\n[list]\n[*] Some puzzles are really suffering from the old school point and click adventure syndrome. You will get stuck if you don't pay attention specifically to the contextual clicks. \n[*] Too many subplots at time really muddy the water in terms of the overall story, and could have maybe eliminated one or two to focus on the bigger plots.\n[*] Felt like hint system in terms of dialogue sometimes sent you in the wrong direction. \n[*] A personal point in terms of games that crash when you alt+tab.\n[/list]\n\nCompletely unrelated to overall review list but is worth a mention:\n[list]\n[*] For some reason, Nvidia shadowplay's recording icon decided to show up for some reason, maybe with the weird way that the resolution is put on the screen.\n[/list]\n\nFor More First Impressions and Edited Gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPUpNmZc_-g", "timestamp_created": 1432224763, "timestamp_updated": 1432224781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546681", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39497412": {"recommendationid": "39497412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100899849", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 613, "last_played": 1516493493}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm inept with games but this one wasn't too painful and even I didn't take a ridiculous amount of time getting through it.

It\u2019s a niche developer/publisher that serves one market and serves it very well - traditional pixel point-n-clicks made in different permutations of Adventure Game Studio. They are always polished, feature many of the same voice actors, and all come with delightful developer commentary tracks that net you an achievement for listening to them all the way through. My usual M.O. for this is to play the game through once, get all the other achievements, and then shelve it for some later date to get the developer\u2019s commentary one. For Technobabylon, that time is now.\n\nIt\u2019s one of my two favorite Wadjet Eye games and probably one of my favorite cyberpunk narratives period (yes, better than Dex). Cyberpunk isn\u2019t just an aesthetic - it\u2019s a social commentary, set of themes to explore, and way to look at the world on a macro (universal) and micro (individual person) scale. This game is great about doing all of it - wrestling with themes of megacorps and genetic engineering as well as themes of how far do you go for family and how much privacy should each person get.\n\nAlso: women!!! There are so many women in this game who are important. Two of the three player characters and (most) of the Big Bads of the game are intelligent, nuanced women who move and shake the plot. It\u2019s great and awesome and see you guys it\u2019s not that hard you just literally have to put them in there.\n\nI strongly recommend this for people anywhere remotely interested in cyberpunk and/or point and click adventure games.", "timestamp_created": 1516587860, "timestamp_updated": 1516587860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 9, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "total_positive": 657, "total_negative": 34, "total_reviews": 691}}

It might not seem like much but probably ~30% of your input was menu navigation that you just don't have to do in this version, and this is a game that could easilly take you 200 hours to 100%, So that adds up. Lessor, But nice, additions are an option to turn off that awful blur filter on the sprites, optional mouse control if you're into that, Native boarderless windowed fullscreen that behaves on alt-tabbing, improved item sprites, and new higher-fidelity versions of background music.\n\n\nAlso nice is that you get all of Dark Hero Days DLC content with some extras.

I personally like the old UI and the new graphics with no character filter. Also a huge up for the port is getting to choose the battle speed, or how fast it takes characters to go from point a to point b. the default speed has always felt super slow to me so I'm happy this was added. \n\nthe DLC characters are pretty nice too.

Being the type of player that enjoyed Lufia 2's ancient dungeon, and Star Ocean 2's Bonus dungeon's, I thought that I would really enjoy some of Disgaea's game mechanics -- in particular randomly generated item worlds, and the ability to level your characters well beyond the typical 99 cap (the cap in this game is literally 199000 levels....yes, you read that right).\n\nUnfortunately, This is the most unnecessarily complicated game I have ever played in my life. There is simply too much going on to make it enjoyable. The game plays more like a single player MMO in terms of sheer grindiness, none of which is remotely necessary to complete the storyline. \n\nPros:\nFun storyline and reasonable plot\nGreat voice acting (main character sounds like Goku)\nGood music and graphics for the genre\n\nCons:\nThis game has everything and the kitchen sink thrown into it, and yet there isn't even that much variety. \nYou can create as many characters as you want over a broad range of your typical RPG classes (thieves, knights, mages, etc). Each of those classes has multiple tiers that are unlockable through leveling. Each of those characters can be leveled to 199000, by repeatedly going to level 9999 and reincarnating back to level 1 again. Additionally, all characters can train in any of the 5 types of equipment (swords, bows etc), and gain skill levels (up to 255) that unlock new abilities. Those abilities can then be leveled up to 99 each. \nIf all of the above wasn't enough, you will also level every single item in the game, from your lowly potions to your high level gear. In order to do that, you have to enter into the \"item world\" which is basically a RNG created world for that specific item. Items come in common (30 floors), rare (60 floors), and legendary (100 floors) qualities. Every 10 floors you have the chance to leave the dungeon. Every 30 floors there is a boss character. Each floor you complete adds a level to the item...though the max level for a legendary is actually 200, which you can get to by burning even more time in item world by going into \"mystery gates\" which are random encounters.\nAnd if all that wasn't bad enough, items also have \"specialists\", which are 20 different types of souls that can by slotted into an item to provide additional benefits like raising stats. Sound easy? Nope. You have to level those too....up to level 20000 for a stat related soul. Oh and those souls have to be \"subdued\" so they can be transferred to other items....a process that consists of killing them in the item world. \nBut wait! That's not all! In addition to the normal slog of killing things and leveling, most maps have what's known as \"Geo Panels\", which come with their own sets of effects. For instance, you could stand on a 20% damage panel and lose 20% of your health per turn. Now that doesn't sound so bad, except that you're going to be completing thousands of these floors, and you can't even autopilot. Even when your character is 1000x more powerful than the enemies you're encountering, you still have to pay attention, or else you might find yourself dead regardless. \n\nThis whole game is a tireless, neverending slog which is almost entirely devoid of purpose. It's almost as if it was created solely to laugh at completionists/perfectionist players that want to maximise their gaming experience.

While this does add playtime, it is mind-numbing and repetitive; so unless you just want to beat the story modes, prepare for a LONG grind. \n\nGreat game. Shitty gear perfection keeps this from getting a 10/10.

I recommend this game to people who enjoyed the first Disgaea, Final Fantasy Tactics or any kind of grindy turn-based RPG. The game is a little bit too grindy for my taste, but later games in series make the process more enjoyable (they are yet to be ported though...).\n\nIn comparison with the first part of Disgaea series, it looks pretty solid. \n\nGameplay contains much more features than the first one, which, however, are yet to be polished (in the next games that slowly make their way to PC users). Usage of monsters in your squad is more interesting than before (a pity that the brand-new mechanic starts working only after your first playthrough...)and special abilities make classes truly unique. New specialists are good and amount of skills is great. \n\nHowever, the gameplay contains some annoying features like (completely luck-based) farming for Treasure Maps to unlock an area with better stuff and, well, basically endgame content. Another one is 'Felony' system, which represent an interesting mechanic and has some entertaining cutscenes, but requires a little but too much effort to provide valuable results (also required to be used to have bad endings).\n\nPlot-wise the game seems slightly inferior to the first game. The plot still contains a nice range of emotions (upbeat/cute/sad), but the scale is more shallow. In my opinion, it references (okay, simply uses) Etna and Laharl, a little bit too agressivly. The main rival, Axel, is rediculed way more than Mid-Boss/Vyers was in the first game and he fails to provide a nice impression, unlike Vyers, even though being mentioned for longer periods time - they needed 'Dark Hero Days' expansion, which allows us to play a story of Axel, to truly show us what a person he is. Endings are abundant, but only the main ending feels complete, while others leave an impression of being cut just after the culmination. The worst ending cuts back and provides some nightmare fuel, something that children of sin deserve <3\n\nMusic is still great. That's it, I highly recommend to listen to some heartwarming, cool, encouraging tracks: Cyber Dance, White Tiger, Sparkling (main ending ost), ETONA Rock, some others.\n\nTo be honest, I am not a perfectionist/completionist, I don't have enough love for grinding. It slightly spoils the endgame content for me since you just have to earn these sweet 9999 levels, Yosh*tsunas and so on, but I will probably try to complete this one.", "timestamp_created": 1499034260, "timestamp_updated": 1499034260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647206", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33140566": {"recommendationid": "33140566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018381782", "num_games_owned": 630, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 528, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486069711}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, even better then the first one!", "timestamp_created": 1499015052, "timestamp_updated": 1499015052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33080864": {"recommendationid": "33080864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128243251", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499583888}, "language": "english", "review": "Good old nostalgia game!", "timestamp_created": 1498910730, "timestamp_updated": 1498910730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462730", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33004324": {"recommendationid": "33004324", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986541538", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 3933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511701125}, "language": "english", "review": "Insanely good so far.

Like Borderlands, no 2 legendaries are the same here...\n* Did you love Fire Emblem, Tactic's Ogre or Final Fantasy Tactics/Advance?\n* Are you at least 30 years old and you know what the hell I'm talking about? \n\nThen welcome to Disgaea. It's a treasured console series from the PS2, PSP, PS3, and Vita days. The \"Master Race\" is indeed a very deprived race... this games over 10 years old and it just came out in 2017 on PC. WTF? \n\nDisgaea 2 PC is a strategy RPG, with countless hours of fun, grinding, hundreds of items, armor, weapons, and about \"200\" unit classes... supposedly. It's kinda like chess... after a few grams of mushrooms... for geeks. \n\nThe combo's, spells, and basic attacks are all amazingly BRUTAL looking. When you see an anime girl throw a penguin up in the air and kick him in the sack, then she squeels in ecstasty... it's at that moment you'll realize this was the best money you ever spent.\n\nIt runs on any potato, smart-phone, or laptop smooth as butter... and put away that keyboard and mouse Dood!! This game requires a controller to operate it at full speed and nostalgia. Although if the controller still baffles you after it's invention in the 1970's, you can use a KB/M. NIS did an upstanding job of giving Disgaea the HD treatment. It looks as good as can be expected in 1080p considering the games age.\n\nDon't expect top of the line graphics though! Those boobies are pixelated and you know you love it! The sprite animations are in a league of their own. The music sounds like it came from a PSP (and it did), but it's catchy and well done. The menu system is quick and inuitive. The RPG elements and statisics analyzing will melt your brain. The story is... who cares about the story? It's just a stupid fun game. You'll skip past the story anyways. But if you don't the story is a light hearted, humor based story of demons, overlords, criminals, and freeing the human race. Typical Japanese style weirdness. And the game is suitable for your kids too with no seriously objectionable content... provided your kids can handle the graphics. But hey... they play MineCraft, right? \n\nLong story short... if you're looking for your SRPG fix, and you missed Disgaea back on PS2 because you were tea-bagging bad kids in Halo 2, or dungeon crawling in Diablo 2... now's your chance. Strategy RPG's are a dying genre with only Disagea and Fire Emblem still active as franchises.\n\nThat's the beautiful thing about Steam. It has a library of all the old games you wanted many years ago, but were too young and broke to afford. Console or PC games, doesn't matter, Steam has many of the gems. Now you're an adult and the games are mere dollars...\n\nQuit ripping yourself off and buy it. It's cheap. It's never too late. You got some catching up to do :)", "timestamp_created": 1498266111, "timestamp_updated": 1500660658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 278, "votes_funny": 76, "weighted_vote_score": "0.809123",

GAME IN AXEL MODE!! GOOGLE it and find out why, and learn about all the benefits you get to carry over to ADELL MODE< ( YES THERE ARE TWO MODES). You continue into ADELL MODE AFTER AXEL MODE.. Do not screw this Up and start Adell Mode First, or you will not have Magic Change,  Throw and Receive, and Many of the DLC /New Characters, NEW MONSTERS nor the AWESOME LEVEL GRINDING Spots IN AXEL MODE, until You beat ADELL MODE, thats like 20 Chapters and the Whole main Story with none of those options, Until you get into New Game + and then AXEL MODE will be much harder as well, I warned you. START IN AXEL MODE.\n\n\nFirst I suppose I should let you know I have every single Disgaea game available for consoles... Yes even the Original Disgaea 2 hour of Darkness. As in the original Released discs PS2 Discs.\n\nSecond, this version is better than the PS2 version in every way. Heres WHY>\n\nBetter Graphics (Character Filters, User Interface, Resolution that plays perfectly on a 4k TV, improved Character Portraits, and again Sharper Resolution for the cutscenes etc. )\n\nThis is not simply a port. They have gone out of their way to make sure this is the best version of the game available. No Joke. \n\nIt includes All the Extras from Dark Hero Days for the PSP, this changes everything. (More Characters, More Story, More Grinding, and leveling up areas, more Fights, More Cutscenes, and more AXEL..( He's really stupid but he grows on ya), MOAR Monsters, more Mechanics Like Stack Attacks, Throw and Recieve, and Magic Change 1 and 2. PLUS ALL THE DLC CHARACTERS FROM BOTH VERSIONS OF THE GAME, FREE.....:)\n\nIn 2 weeks I have played 140 Hours... Does that tell you anything?\n\nIs it better Than Disagea 3, 4 , D2, or 5?  It has a way better story than 3 and D2 and 5, ( 4 is the best story of all of them) and it adds the Play mechanics from 3 which greatly increase it Play value and Fun factor.\n\n\nAll I am going to say is if you have nerver played a Japanese SRPG (Strategy) then this one is a great starting point, it makes Disgaea 1 even the PC version almost unbearable to play... OMG Grinding in Disgea 1 was way way WAY slower.\nIf you know what you are doing you can easily have a team of level 200+ Units and top end Gear in 25-35 hours.\n\nIf you dont know what you are doing > GOOGLE, and save your self many mnay hours of wasted time... This is a researchers dream come true, read about strategies, tactics that other people used, Best methods for obtaining the Best Gear and massive Damage numbers, Secrets GALORE, and Character Leveling/Best Grinding techniques.\n\nFinally this is just an epic game, and you will never know the satisfaction of it unless you play it..

After putting in over 250 hours in the first game (I had it on the Nintendo DS an told myself i would buy Disgaea2 when I finished it) I never got sick of it. This game is highly addictive, beautiful music, beautiful graphics, and mechanics/control intuition that surpass every tactical RPG I have ever played.\n\nDisgaea 2 expands on the item world, the Dark Assembly, and character selection. Even at the beginning of the game (Currently at 24 hours at the time this was written), I am in love with the pirates invading the item world and new geopanel status effects all the way to the drunkards trying to slap my bribes down. I have always loved the Disgaea mechanics on leveling up the stats, items, characters, and seeing everyone grow into terrors to be reckoned with. If you have Dragon Ball Syndrome, you would love this game. You grow your characters into killing machines while measuring their aptitudes in weapon abillities and stats. \n\nDisgaea 2 PC introduces new downloadable characters to play as well. When I played Disgaea HoD, I never used the story characters except Laharl. I also never used the monsters either because the monsters were not nearly as strong as the humanoids. It was a shame because I often got bored raising monsters in HoD that weren't near as powerful as my humanoids. Disgaea 2 fixes both of these problems. Personal preference, but I love AdelxRozalyn. I also love Majin Hanako, Gig, and Dark Eclair. This extended cast is just more likable to me than those in HoD. The monsters are very well balanced in this game, I find the Monster Tamer to be a fun addition for now. My opinion might change on the Tamer later on, but for now I enjoy using monsters more than ever. Even making some to raise with the Tamer to beef up the stats and set them loose to kill. \n\nThe Disgaea series has been my favorite game for years now.

It has interesting characters and plot (or at least compared to the other games in the series), great soundtrack and sfx, menus tell you more (Disgaea 2 tells you what stats affect the damage of skills), the addition of felonies, better monster classes (there are now monster weapons that are intended for INT-based monsters), and every class has a unique trait.\n\nPeople often say that the game is grindy and I would have to agree. You could easily beat the game without grinding, but if you want to do any of the endgame stuff like most of the dlc and cave of ordeals, you're going to need to be pretty high level. I don't actually mind grinding in this though because I feel a drive to make my characters stronger to unlock more classes, skills, etc which is enjoyable for me.\n\nIt also comes with all the dlc", "timestamp_created": 1495403189, "timestamp_updated": 1495403189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31830274": {"recommendationid": "31830274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275951151", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504203687}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8865\u7968\uff0c\u4ee5\u524d\u5728psp\u4e0a\u73a9\uff0c \u73b0\u5728\u518d\u73a9\u4e00\u904d\u73a9\u7684\u90fd\u662f\u56de\u5fc6", "timestamp_created": 1495145453, "timestamp_updated": 1495145453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31795302": {"recommendationid": "31795302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094228401", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 17854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513031038}, "language": "english", "review": "The bomb Dood!", "timestamp_created": 1494972635, "timestamp_updated": 1494972635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463320", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31731669": {"recommendationid": "31731669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268391061", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495041416}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game if you have the time for it.

The difference being that Disgaea has character's that make cameos and/or play roles in the other titles (at least, thus far). Additionally, Disgaea keeps the same battle system and follows the incremental upgrade pathway for a series, whereby each following title improves on the last.\n\nSo nothing comes as a surprise here: Disgaea 2 follows the same conventions as Disgaea 1:\n\n-Story mode is progressed through a Menu whereby each episode consists of 4 battle maps (varies, but typically 4) and upon completing the final one, a new episode is unlocked\n-Everything you need to access (item dungeons, shops, etc) are all accessed from the hubworld; there is no open world exploration (or even linear world exploration) like most JRPG's\n-New characters are unlocked/gained through regular progression in the story as well as character creation with mana attained from battles.\n-No grinding is necessary to complete the story mode\n\nJust as in 1 I love the streamlined manner in which story mode works. There's no long JRPG quest here; you just go straight into the battles with a short cutscene always proceeding it. There's no forgetting where to go next if you stop playing for a week or having to go grab items in several towns and dungeons to continue onwards with the story. The story itself is also a relatively light-hearted romp with a usually comedic tone.\n\nThe item world makes a comeback; the randomly generated maps whereby progression is done by getting to the exit. Included now are random encounters that occur without notice; enemies drop by the maps and you can either face them for good loot or just proceed to the next level of the map. They appear sparsely so facing them is always recommended, the problem is that as it's random the random encountered enemies might be leagues beyond your own level, making the whole ordeal moot. Given that these encounters rarely occur and some of the enemies carry items required to open optional maps in the story mode, some consistency would've been appreciated in their levels relative to the player's. There are also \"mystery rooms\" in the item world, which are alternate exits that take you to a dark room which either consists of merchants hawking rare wares, fights that will increase the items level, or treasure chests with items in them. Always recommended to go into the rooms unless you're not hurting for money, items, or planning on ditching the item after getting the specialists.\n\nThe Dark Assembly receives a rather large change; not only are the different bills you can pass more varied, but character unlocking is now done through the assembly itself. Whereas before unlocking new classes to create required meeting certain pre-requisites, now they've added the additional step of having to pass a bill allowing access to the class once the pre-requisite is met. Bills, as before, are passed through an assembly whereby you spend accumulated mana from battles to pass bills of varying costs; bills have an approval rate and if they fail you can eliminate senators unfavorable to your bill in a battle or just give up on the bill and attempt passing it later (spent mana is not recouped). \n\nThe assembly itself requires less fighting than in the previous title. As senators will hate you more and more the more you fight them, it's not recommended to do so unless you're going to go level 1000 as many of these senators levels are in the hundreds. This penalty for fighting is a bit of a shame, as tossing no votes on top of higher levelled yes votes presented an enjoyable level of strategy; granted this is still possible but having hatred of your actions persist on the playthrough is a bit cumbersome and annoying when you just can't fight your way through a bill. Rather, gaining favor with senators and parties is the way to go now, which is certainly duller (and easier). It's not that an option was taken away, it's that it's not optimal now.\n\nAs for the fighting system: same old same old. Veterans will feel at home and it's as if nothing changed. The few differences are minimal: classes now have passive abilities unique to them that differentiate the classes more than just what weapon affinities they have. The series still requires a bit more differentiation between the classes to provide an impetus for creation past merely wanting to have every class in the game.\n\nSo past me giving out on a few points, is this an improvement over Disgaea 1? On a base level there is more here; so yes. But as the largest difference is the story and characterization, I'd have to say it's lower on the totem poll in that regard. Laharl, Etna, and Flonne made a good trio that often clashed. Here you have Rozalin and Adell which have an interesting dynamic as they are technically enemies working together, and for the manner in which the developers went about their relationship they deserve a thumbs up. Otherwise there's less laughter here; Tink is rather memorable as is Axel, but characters like Hanako and Taro are just there. The story was alright and had more \"substance\" than the \"I wanna be the strongest!\" plotline of Disgaea 1, but I still prefer the first games title as it still had multiple plotpoints occuring at once whereas here it's just Adell and Rozalin with the same goal of meeting Zenon. The fact that Etna steals the spotlight here even though she's not the MAIN character (albeit an important one) gives substance to the claim that the main cast from 1 was more memorable.\n\nSounds like I'm giving out about it, but the item world is still fun as hell, the grind is addictive *even though it isn't necessary*, which is almost paradoxical for anything with \"RPG\" in the title. You'll still waste inordinates amount of time going to the item world to level up equipment (every level traverssed increases item stats), and you'll be going to the item world to subdue specialists in the items themselves-which give a variety of effects and can be transferred to better items once subdued. I still spent more time doing things other than the story for no reason other than being addicted to moving specialists and strengthening equipment.\n\nFinal verdict? Good title albeit not as good in plot or characters *overall*. But on the game itself and the mechanics, more of the same and if you enjoyed it previously you'll enjoy it again. Just be sure not to play it directly after the first game.", "timestamp_created": 1494209754, "timestamp_updated": 1495403847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542934", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31597565": {"recommendationid": "31597565", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022410719", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 634, "last_played": 1516260543}, "language": "french", "review": "J'ai fais Disgaea 1 et 4, mais pour moi le meilleur au niveau de l'histoire est celui ci, Disgaea 2, je sais que beaucoup ne seront pas d'accord et diront que le meilleur reste le premier mais bon les go\u00fbts et les couleurs ... ;)\n\nEn tout cas je m'amuse comme un fou sur Disgaea 2 PC, en plus ils ont renouvel\u00e9 l'interface et \u00e7a c'est cool ^^\n\nJ'ai h\u00e2te de pouvoir jouer au 3 mais surtout au D2 si un jour il sort sur pc !!!", "timestamp_created": 1494139550, "timestamp_updated": 1494139550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680304", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31589747": {"recommendationid": "31589747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250811136", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500153927}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game to death, but for some reason whenever i open the game i have no sound at all. volume is turned all the way up and all my drivers are up to date if anyone else has had this problem and them got it fixed please let me know how too fix it..... :(", "timestamp_created": 1494103631, "timestamp_updated": 1494103631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500413", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31584716": {"recommendationid": "31584716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042893622", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494107682}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved this game on the console.

I would love to see more PS2 ports hit steam, and can't wait for awesome games like Disgaea 4: APR (great damn game) to hit steam.

Fortunatelly this version has some improvements since Dark Hero Days in some ways.\nThe story is nothing new but is pretty decent; difficulty wise the main story is very easy if you go offtrack and go to the Item World, which can happen a lot if you like to be overlevel. The postgame is very grindy, but fortunately less tedious in some ways from most of the usual RPGs since the levels are randomly generated. \n\nPros:\n+ Improved UI. The item's icons and menus looks pretty good.\n+ No need to buy the DLCs since the game automaticaly gives you the events to unlock the DLC characters. This is the only reason why I won't say the game is overpriced (even more I got it in a sale).\n+It's a strategy RPG. If you love to grind, craft you perfect items and characters this game is for you.\n+ The grinding is less tedious since Item World generates all the levels. You can get some pretty and nasty surprises from enemies holding that item that you want and Pirates ambushing you!\n+The OST is awesome AND you can change it for Item World anytime. Even the DLC's characters got their songs added to the PC version. \n+Aside from the real final superboss, you can beat most of the endgame stuff with almost every character. It's good  since you're not forced to abuse Magic Knight / Lahalh / etc to beat most of postgame bosses. But the same can't be said from the final superboss (if they kept his difficulty as the PSP version)\n\nCons\n- The grinding has a LOT of resets in the Item World for you to pray for RNG to give you Good/Great Luck on the Mistery Gate (only applies for perfecting Items for the fina superboss). I had Mao showing up 4 times without an Old Man appearing on the Mistery Gate one afternoon! Also grinding Lovers and Felonies can consume a long time.\n- The game is 99% a port. I would love to see the same game with HD characters.\n- Dark Eclair's portrait looks awful AND I didn't unlock her OST in the Item World even after obtaining her and buying songs from the Item World's Succubus. Maybe you need to get all the DLC characters and the devs screwed up on the unlocking musics for the IW?\n\nIf you like SRPGs and grinding, this game is for you. If you don't like to grind, stay away from this game unless you only want to do the main game. It's one of the few games when it was released that you could inflict millions of damage and the game needed to use short lenght for the damage!

The time you spend in this game is always rewarded, and you will never feel like you are \"wasting\" time. Each challenge in the game (normal + post game) requires you to farm just a little bit more to achieve your next objective. Other than grinding itself, the general mechanics of the game are very well done, starting from the character creation to the combat system. I loved every aspect of this game, most likely my favorite game of all time. \n\nAbsolutely a mustbuy for RPG lovers. \nVirtually infinite, you could just spam item world forever and you will always have something new to do. \n\nDon't buy it if you want a super deep story, as you will find a retard flying frog, a evil principal getting turned on by your super strenght, a retard overlord kid, and Axel the dark Hero, the most retard character i have ever seen (and his little Brother, axident). \n\nBuy it if you want to get turned on by your super strenght after 6 hours of farming.\n\nJokes aside, the only real negative thing about the game is (except ambling pirates) that you must follow lots of guides to fully understand the game in all its mechanics, as some of them are really complex when you face them for the first time. \nWell negative for some, at least. I even made excel files to study all that shit and it had been great.\n\nWaiting ansiamente for Disgaea 3, because the guy who gets turned on is probably my favorite character.\nAxident is the best name for a kid, i know i know.", "timestamp_created": 1490692486, "timestamp_updated": 1490693033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642660", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30787742": {"recommendationid": "30787742", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020403710", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 4657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507748663}, "language": "english", "review": "It rocks!!!

It's a slighlty different game, but nothing has scratched that itch like this, since - to include FFT-A (!).\n\nThis game is amazing, if you're at all a fan of gearing up, tweaking, and grinding in an RPG. It doesn't have the perpetual \"oh no, didn't get lucky for that 1 in 1,000,000 roll\" of the ARPG Diablo style games, and it doesn't have a \"you must grind 1,000 levels over years\" of a KRPG. With any RPG sensibilities, you most likely can clear the main game without ever grinding - natural leveling should cover things. If you *want* to keep going, you can - there are layers upon layers of additional challenges you can further advance your characters through, with commeasurate \"hidden\", \"side\" or \"post-game\" bosses/challenges to match up your advancement with.\n\nSome don't like the story, and it isn't exactly going to win any awards, but I thought it was fine enough - and better than most JRPG stories (no fate of the world hanging in the balance, but still serious movers and shakers).\n\nLove, love, love. And, the best part is... it looks like I can keep playing until I feel done. Awesome. Definitely not everyone's cup of tea, and if you're a completionist... better set aside the next year of your life.\n\nAnd how many RPGs dare you to break \"the rules\" of the game? \"Ah, I'm going to lift my characters and throw them over here and extend their movement and get bonus points on this or that...\"", "timestamp_created": 1489855501, "timestamp_updated": 1489855501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603131", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30585046": {"recommendationid": "30585046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025486310", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 2778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487236270}, "language": "english", "review": "I just discovered Disgaea this year and I've been missing out on this gem for last 2 decades. \nIf you're a fan of RPG's you NEED to play this game! \n\nThis game has it all and you'll definitely find yourself chuckling throughout your playthrough. \n\nIf you loved Final Fantasy Tactics, then you're going to love this even more!", "timestamp_created": 1489819876, "timestamp_updated": 1489819876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670848", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30576785": {"recommendationid": "30576785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056745003", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 14994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510598691}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply put, it's one of the main games of my childhood (ironic, since the game is mainly about adult humor), and it still holds up surprisingly well, even after 11 years.

Let me give you an example.\n\nThe true final boss of the game essentially requires you to have several perfect items equipped. To get a perfect item, you need to collect bonus levels while leveling up an item. The \"mystery\" (aka RNG) portal that gives bonus levels CAN (but doesn't always) spawn every 3 floors. Even if the portal does spawn, it  LIKELY DOES NOT contain the bonus levels you need. \n\n[u]What does this mean?[/u] It means that every 3 floors, you RESET THE GAME if you don't find your portal. If you find a portal, YOU RESET your game if it isn't one that gives bonus levels. To get a perfect item, you'll end up quitting and reloading the game upwards of 200 times. By the time you've beaten the true final boss of the game, you've reset thousands of times and there is simply *no way around that.* \n\nIf you want to beat the post-game, you'll get really acquainted with this series of events: Menu, down down down down, quit game, yes, continue game, yes, talk to item worlder, enter item world, yes, check for portal, see that there in no portal, menu, down down down down, quit game, and repeat. You'll be doing that for hours. After a while your fingers hurt solely from resetting so much.\n\nDoes that sound like fun?\n\nThe true final boss of the game also requires you to have maxed out stats through leveling. Which means you'll be playing one map (Cave of Ordeals 4) over and over and over and over and over to level up, store somewhere between 6000-9999 levels, reincarnate to level 1, and do it again. \n\nDoes that sound like fun?\n\nJust know what you're getting into. Personally, I don't mind leveling in the manner I just described. It's definitely not ideal, but you do get to watch your numbers go up, and in true \"role-play\" fashion, it does feel like your character is actually training.  I *DO*, however, mind being forced to reset the game so often in order to actually complete it. It's poor design. What happened is that people basically broke the ps2 version of the game by forcing perfect items through resets, and to compensate they released a boss that requires perfect items in the PSP version of the game. This version.\n\nDisgaea 1 did not require resets very often (just fringe cases of rarity matching and removing specialists). Having 100%'d both D1 and D2 here on steam, I can say that I enjoyed the post game a lot more in the first installment. \n\nI'm giving this game a lukewarm positive review because the story was fun the whole way through, and the post game has some decent content until you need to start perfecting stuff. I've read Disgaea 3 and upwards contain less of this \"reset hell,\" so here's hoping.\n\n7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1488942920, "timestamp_updated": 1489037960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.815932", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30376240": {"recommendationid": "30376240", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991124354", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495730591}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolute beauty and should be on your list when steam sales come.\n\nCompared to Disgaea 1:\n- Passive character-specific abilities increase variance in your team composition\n- More end-game content; dark sun mode, Axel mode, land of carnage\n- Random occurences in item-world so the grinding stays fun longer\n- Bland dialog. \"I will keep my promise!

However, there is very little (if any) in the way of open-world exploration, so if you're expecting something along the lines of Final Fantasy, you'll be disappointed. Equally, if you're not into combat or turn-based strategies, you should probably give it a miss; it's essentially all that the gameplay consists of.\n\nWhile I seem to be ruling out a lot of people and insinuating that the game is niche, I actually think it's just the opposite; the story is much more interesting than many Western titles, and it's sprinkled with humour which will connect with both anime/JRPG fans and the uninitiated alike. Often, I found myself wanting to speed through the combat as quickly as possible (to the detriment of strategy and progress), just so that I could see what happens next.\n\n It's definitely worth a purchase if you like JRPGs and even turn-based strategies, and obviously, if you've liked other titles in the series, then it's a no-brainer. As a port, it's very good and runs smoothly (though for me, every time I quit the game, it decided to stop responding; whilst irritating, that's the point of quitting anyway).\n\nHowever, if you've played Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories or Dark Hero Days, and still own it, I'd suggest waiting until you find this version cheap, perhaps in the Steam Summer Sale; as far as I can tell, there's no brand-new content added exclusively for the PC version. which means that buying it again would simply be a nostalgia trip. In the meantime, I advise you dust down your old PS2 or PSP and play that instead; but If you no longer own those and miss playing it, then Nippon Ichi have produced the perfect solution, for new and

Not all keyboard keys are in logical places but this set-up is functional. You can also play keyboard only if that is your thing.\n\nI've not experienced any sound issues yet. The game has Japanese audio which you can enable from the settings. Music in this game is pretty good.\n\nI'm giving this game a bit of slack on graphics front since it's so old and runs in-general so well.

Y, por supuesto, por el mero hecho de conocer a Adell y Rozalin, dos personajes geniales cuyos comentarios entre ellos no tiene desperdicio.\n\nSi todas las entregas de la saga gozan de la misma calidad que esta, no ser\u00eda descabellado ponerla a la altura de Final Fantasy Tactics o Suikoden.

(if you can spare an equipment slot)\n-There's a lot more cute monsters this time around! 0w0\n- The item world has random Mystery Rooms every few floors and you can cause Dark Courts to appear at certain floors, breaking up the monotony of levelling up items with some bonus rewards, shopping, or minibosses. You even sometimes get a chance to buy Rare and Legendary items, which means you don't need to spend ages looking for a Legendary Cosmic Blade!\n-The story is made out of several parallel narratives, which leads to an overall smoother pacing.\n- There is no damage from ending a turn lifting an ally, and a stack of characters can do special combo attacks, making the lift/throw system more useful than just quickly moving around.\n- There are magical monster weapons now making caster monsters more viable in combat.\n-The Demon Rank system is removed, anyone can apply for any Dark Assembly bill... no more need to grind Promotion Exams whenever you want to do something!\n\nAnd to all of the above, add more secret bosses than ever before and no less than TWO alternate overworlds to unlock (the Dark World and the Land of Carnage) that each adds new challenge to the basic story missions, and you easily have enough content to spend hundreds of hours playing.", "timestamp_created": 1486287017, "timestamp_updated": 1486287017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.713497", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29712441": {"recommendationid": "29712441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063391848", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488650995}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a good and solid tactical jrpg to start with.

Great job NISA!\n\nTL;DR: I wholeheartedly recommend Disgaea 2 PC for $20, especially if you've played Disgaea PC. (Buy it so we can get future Disgaea games on PC :D)\n\n------------------------\nLet's get introductions out of the way first, dood:\n\nDisgaea 2 PC is a port of the PSP remake of Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories, called Disgaea 2: Dark Hero Days. (Lots of confusing names thrown around, I apologize! Basically: PS2 - Cursed Memories > PSP - Dark Hero Days > PC - Disgaea 2 PC) Disgaea 2 PC is much more of the gameplay from Disgaea PC, but improved.\n\nFrom my previous Disgaea PC review: ( https://steamcommunity.com/id/cuhbrewin/recommended/405900/ )\n\n[quote=Cuhbrewin]Disgaea (the series) is a tactical RPG (grid-based, turn-based, action points, the usual deal) with its key selling point being the ability to grind out your stats and level to absurd highs. The caps for stats and level are insanely high (~20 million for each stat in Disgaea PC and 9999 for level). There's a lot of bonus maps, content, and endings to access that the game acknowledges how many New Game Pluses you've done.\n... ...\n\nAnother highlight of the Disgaea franchise is the Item World, a completely randomized dungeon crawl generated from items you collect in the game. By exploring the Item World, you can grab more items, grind out EXP, and improve that item's stats. Each item contains an expansive dungeon of 30, 60, or 100 floors, depending on the item's rarity.[/quote]\n\nI'd like to add that Disgaea is perhaps a fully-aware series (in that it KNOWS it's a series of grinding SRPGs, and that the characters are well aware they are part of an entertainment medium), and I personally enjoy fourth-wall leaning/breaking in games. I'm a sucker for being super over-leveled for a stage so this series scratches my \"power fantasy itch\" well. Also, this series has some crazy over-the-top attack animations that just has to be experienced.\n\nDisgaea 2 remains mostly similar to Disgaea 1. So, instead of just analyzing this title on its own, I'm going to compare and contrast Disgaea 1 (PC) and Disgaea 2 (PC).\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]Criteria[/th]\n[th]D1 \"Normal Review\" Score[/th]\n[th]D1 \"Average = 5/10\" Score[/th]\n[th]D2 \"Normal Review\" Score[/th]\n[th]D2 \"Average = 5/10\" Score[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Story/Plot[/td]\n[td]9/10[/td]\n[td][i]8/10[/i][/td]\n[td]7/10[/td]\n[td][i]5/10[/i][/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Characters[/td]\n[td]7/10[/td]\n[td][i]6/10[/i][/td]\n[td]8/10[/td]\n[td][i]7/10[/i][/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Music[/td]\n[td]8/10[/td]\n[td][i]6/10[/i][/td]\n[td]10/10[/td]\n[td][i]9/10[/i][/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Graphics/Art Style[/td]\n[td]5/10[/td]\n[td][i]4/10[/i][/td]\n[td]5/10[/td]\n[td][i]4/10[/i][/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Mechanics[/td]\n[td]8/10[/td]\n[td][i]7/10[/i][/td]\n[td]9/10[/td]\n[td][i]8/10[/i][/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Value[/td]\n[td]10/10[/td]\n[td][i]10/10[/i][/td]\n[td]10/10[/td]\n[td][i]10/10[/i][/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Performance[/td]\n[td]8/10[/td]\n[td][i]7/10[/i][/td]\n[td]9/10[/td]\n[td][i]9/10[/i][/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\nGoing off this table, you can see I slightly lean towards Disgaea 2 for music and characters, but Disgaea 1 for a story. On their own, I like most of the D2 characters -- heck even Taro and Hanako I don't mind too much -- except for maybe Yukimaru, zam. ...GOD THAT \"ZAM\" IS ANNO-- *clears throat* I'm joking about not liking Yukimaru :). Anyway... the plot of Disgaea 2 that the characters are placed in is... well, I can't really express it other than \"it's just a pretty good story\". Whereas D1 has an excellent story [spoiler](in that Laharl finds and accepts love; trust me, play D1 it's better than it sounds)[/spoiler], but most of the characters are all bonkers, if not a little annoying (whether on purpose or otherwise idk; in Disgaea D2 they're much more enjoyable imo). Basically what I'm getting at is D1 has genre-savvy characters in an overall excellent RPG plot and D2 has cliche characters in a rather mediocre RPG plot. Take your pick.\n\nI should probably also say that there's a lot more to do in Disgaea 2, but the added mechanics of Magichange (monster polymorphing into a weapon), \"Toss & Pass\" (monster \"tossing\"), Innocent Towns, Mystery Rooms, and the Land of Carnage just adds on to the amount of things to learn (which is already quite mind-numbing for a newbie before these additions). Overall, the game feels slightly faster and smoother, but not as fast or smooth as I would want it to be. Take that statement however you will.\n\n[strike]I don't use one, but[/strike] I think that a gamepad is preferable for Disgaea. If you don't own one you'll have to fiddle with key binds, like I did. Or, you can try using the Mouse (I don't use Mouse but I hear it's a bit fiddly, just like Disgaea PC) EDIT: I used an Xbox 360 Controller and I can confirm the gamepad support is solid, if maybe a little unstable (the game crashed when my controller lost connection to the wireless receiver).\n\nWith regards to Graphics, neither port/re-make has improved much on/moved beyond the PS2-era graphics (you can only do so much to them). So if you're in the market for a graphically-pleasant SRPG, don't try this one. In terms of music, I didn't think Disgaea 1's soundtrack was bad, but Disgaea 2 has a better OST than D1 in my opinion.\n\nOverall, a better buy than Disgaea PC if you already own that one. Plus, you get an ownership discount for buying Disgaea 2 PC if you own Disgaea PC!

I have never played Final Fantasy or any of it's titles; just Tactics.  I love the way the combat works.  I've always wanted a game that incorporated that type of combat on a non-console; and haven't really been able to do one myself.\n\nHadn't found one, and this looked similar enough - and now that I've played it -\n\nOk let's just get the part out of the way where the Prinny characters say 'DOOD' (pronounced dude) all the time.  Yes, like I do.  Moreso, but well - just like when I speak \"dude\" (a dialect of US English.)  That alone makes me love the game.\n\nThere's a part of the tactics where you can 'lift' (pick up) a character adjascent to you and _throw_ them.  That means you can move further in one turn.  Which is great for extending your attack range.  And you can toss to another character, who can then toss... so you can move very quickly across the battle.  And then you can pick up someone picking someone else up, which... yeah there's a great deal you can do with that tactic.  (Also the prinnies explode when you toss them.  Which is somewhat a problem as they are then dead, but... it's a tactic.)\n\nI haven't quite mastered the combo attack yet (where a character next to another character will combine for a bigger attack) or figured out some of the special attacks, but - yeah.  This is as good, if not better, than Final Fantasy Tactics.\n\nYes, it's a PSP port (thanks Shiki Ryougi), but I don't care - the game is great and I hadn't been familiar with it before.  I am hoping the first in the series, and eventually everything up to and including the 5th version (coming for the Nintendo switch) is available, because this is excellent.\n\nI understand it is very grindy, and I'm likely to be playing this for the rest of my life, as I haven't finished the GBA FFT yet and I've been playing that on/off for 10+ or so years.\n\nSo - if you like Final Fantasy Tactics - you'll likely love this game; very similar, but with it's own extensions to the combat.", "timestamp_created": 1486064436, "timestamp_updated": 1486246292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

If you want to experience it for the first time I'd pass on unlocking the DLC characters until you complete the story one time, as the Map Bonuses for the DLC characters contain mid-game items that completely trivialize the entire first playthough. However, if you want to start your grinding early, the map bonuses are good for getting started right away.\n\nIt is a smooth port.

There aren't many PC-exclusive options but at the same time there really isn't much that needs to be changed. The character filter is alright if you fancy that sort of thing, and the two UI options are very good. Plus, Disgaea 2 had the option to change movement speeds in battle, something that definitely turned me away from the first Disgaea.\n\nIf you liked the first game, pick this up.

The lettering, interface, character portraits, and backgrounds have all been redone to look nice and crisp on modern displays. The same can't be said for the textures and various sprites, however, which really date the game. It would have been trivial, in many cases, to lift character sprites from the newer Disgaea games. Maybe someone will put out a patch (official or otherwise) that will address that.\n\nFor those who are going backward to experience an older title in the series for the first time, fair warning: Many of the quality-of-life features from, say, Disgaea 5 aren't present. It's mostly little things, like immediate access to certain information and visual cues, or the ability to reposition your characters without having to completely reset their movement. Other features, like hot-swapping weapons on the fly, were never part of the original game and shouldn't be expected in the PC version. On the other hand, all this is generally improved over the original Disgaea, so there's that.\n\nMouse control is a little wonky, but functional. You're probably still going to want to play this with a controller, or at least with a combination of keyboard and mouse.\n\nEven without the benefit of nostalgia, I'd recommend this to SRPG fans as a solid title with plenty of tactical variation and innovation.", "timestamp_created": 1485877669, "timestamp_updated": 1485877669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

For previous Disgaea 2: Dark Hero Days or Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories veterans, there will be a lot of Deja Vu. Do not expect a lot of new content here, as this is really a port rather than a new game. But it's still going to be the same great game you remember. If you have not played either of those, and you like turn based strategy games; then you should definitely give Disgaea 2 a look. You can get hundreds of hours of amazing content here for a very affordable price.\n\nAs far as things this PC port does well, many of the 2D graphics have definitely seen some solid improvements. The main characters like Adell for example look much better in the cutscenes. The engine itself feels very solid and I encountered no bugs or issues.\n\nThere are a few things about this PC port that aren't quite perfect. For example, the high definition can cause the terrain to look low resolution in certain areas. But that does not detract from the gameplay at all and is purely aesthetic. The game itself is still very addicting and a lot of fun.\n\nThe sheer volume of content in this game is impressive. From things like the two different storylines (NG+ story), to the extremely in-depth party system with leveling (with things like a master/student system that allows any class to learn another classes ability), and things like a procedurally generated Item World. This game is truly enormous. Don't expect to be able to fully complete this game in a day or a week.

He swears to get stronger to save everyone and mostly his family. However a attempt to summon the Overlord concluded a twisted result. this result led to the Overlords Daughter Rozalin.

when I'm writing this, more than enough to clear chapter 1 and unlock some features.\n\nOk, I'll start saying that I was kinda scared because I expected this to have bugs or problems since some people said that the previous game had them. Luckily (or as it should have been expected) I haven't found any so far, even though there's still lots of attacks and maps to play. Just so you know, I have a 960.\n\nSo, for those who have played the previous game, this one has obviously a different story but the gameplays share lots of features, it's Disgaea after all. For example, pistols still have a huge range of attack, but you can't attack enemies that are in diagonal. Still, easy to get used to. Funny, sometimes absurd just like Disgaea.\n\nOnly bad thing I've found: with the new UI, the pictures in high definition are just... Meh, I don't really like them, the lines look weird. It looks like it hasn't been made by a person. Personal opinion. Fortunately, you can use the old UI and they look as they were in the original game (I suppose).\n\nOverall, a great game as I expected, with tons of content.

For casuals the grind isn't as hard, but in the postgame it's a grindfest! People who don't like the thought of level grinding stay far away from this series. Story is more serious too, but it's kinda generic imho. If you're new to the series I strongly suggest playing this game first, otherwise feel free to start from the beginning.\n\nFull Version: \n\nDisgaea 2 has a special place in my heart since it was the sole reason why I got a psp just to play it back in 2009. In my opinion, if you were to choose between playing the first or second game on steam, I strongly suggest playing this one over the former. Mostly because, I'll be honest here, the first game didn't really age well (especially when compared to later installments in the series) and it feels so archaic playing it after so long. Disgaea 2, on the otherhand, is a game I can always go back to since there's a lot of more content than its predecessor. In terms of story, it's a hit or miss. I personally think it's generic because it just boils down to \"main hero has to defeat evil bad guy in order to break a curse\" kind of story. Despite the bland story, the characters in Disgaea 2 are actually pretty good!\n\nThe main characters this time around are Adell and Rozalin, both of which have great chemistry throughout the story. Not everyone would like Adell since he's pretty bland (i.e. following the chosen one kind of thing) while Rozalin has more character depth and personality throughout the story. I won't spoil anything else about the story since it does have many familiar faces from the first game, as well as a pretty shocking twist for new players, so take my word for it that even though the story isn't great on paper, it does have a satisfying ending.\n\nNow in terms of postgame content, this has A LOT of things to do after the main story. Because, spoilers, the main story only makes up 5% of the actual game! Many things from unlocking the Dark World and conquering it, to fighting hidden boss characters, if you think that the main story wasn't a challenge than these will surely test your patience!\n\nVoice acting wise it's a hit or miss. I personally have no problem with either or. But I sorta like the english dub more since I'm more accustomed to it.\n\nGrinding wise it really isn't that difficult in the main story since Adell has a newb friendly ability (which is to deal more damage against higher level enemies). Postgame on the otherhand, you'll be grinding for DAYS if you want to have a chance to defeat the super boss's the game has to offer.\n\nIn terms of the port quality, it's 1000% better than the first game. I never experienced a single crash when I was beta testing, regardless of how many hours I played.\n\nOverall, if you want a game that will eat up hundreds of hours of your time I strongly recommend playing this game.", "timestamp_created": 1485803833, "timestamp_updated": 1485803833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645084", "comment_count": "17", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29590701": {"recommendationid": "29590701", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004071591", "num_games_owned": 501, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493564898}, "language": "english", "review": "9,999,999,999,999,999 out of 10 dood!", "timestamp_created": 1485802310, "timestamp_updated": 1485802310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 31, "weighted_vote_score": "0.303092", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29590502": {"recommendationid": "29590502", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052681615", "num_games_owned": 823, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489093609}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0411\u043e\u0451\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u2013 \u0448\u0438\u043a, \u043e\u0437\u0432\u0443\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u2013 \u0431\u043b\u0435\u0441\u043a, \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u2013 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0442\u0430.\n\u0422\u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u0434\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0439, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0435\u043b \u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435\u043b \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0430.", "timestamp_created": 1485801567, "timestamp_updated": 1485801567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515267", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29590007": {"recommendationid": "29590007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037166965", "num_games_owned": 1239, "num_reviews": 196, "playtime_forever": 783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485802205}, "language": "italian", "review": "[h1]I Primi 50 minuti del gioco:[/h1]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3MiXfI-MgE\n \n[h1] Un grande ritorno[/h1]\n\nDisgaea 2 \u00e8 un gioco di ruolo a turni creato da Nippon Ichi Software (NIS), nasce nel 2006 su Playstation 2, per poi risplendere nuovamente nel 2009 sulla Playstation Portatile (PSP), addirittura nel 2013 viene riportato con aggiunte su PS3! e dopo \"solo\" 11 anni il titolo approda su PC!.\nSi tratta di un titolo non proprio \"nuovo\" eppure dopo tutti questi anni riesce ancora a farsi notare sia per il gameplay (tutt'ora fresco e divertente) che per le meccaniche interessanti e la trama avvincente.\n\n[h1] TRAMA:[/h1]\n\nQuindici anni addietro, un poderoso Signore del Male, nominato Zenon, apparve su Veldime, maledicendo i popoli l\u00ec risiedenti.

I have probably over 2000 hours on the psp port, and even more on the original, and I still haven't grown bored of it. It's the kind of game you can play for months on end and always have something to do. You have characters to level, weapons to level, skills to level, gear to level, etc. This game is for the grinder at heart that loves to work hard to see numbers rise into seemingly unbelievable heights, but still enjoyable to those that just want to play through the game and be done with it.\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, and during your first and second playthough expect to be stopped and forced to grind levels or seriously rethink your strategy numerous times! Once you get a hang of the mechanics it becomes easier, but with the randomly generated maps in the item world, the \"stronger enemy\" bills you can pass, and the land of carnage(which boosts enemy levels and stats everywhere by 2000%!), expect to always be challenged!\n\nThere are 36 generic characters you can create, and over 20 unique characters. Each with thier own unique look and set of skills, passive ability, and weapon proficiency. Anything you can think of, you can make. A sword priest? Sure! Staff warrior? Probably not a good idea, but you can do it! The level cap is 9999, which is not easy to achieve in the slightest, but it doesn't stop there. Base stats and stat per level is based on \"stored levels\". You give up your gained levels and start at lv1 again to gain bonus stats, and that's what makes your characters truly powerful. And the stored levels cap at 186,000!!! And theres more to it than that, so check the wiki!\n\nQuick list of most of the things to do in this game:\nBeat the story mode\nBeat the alt. story mode\nGet all the endings\nUnlock all playable characters in the same run\nUnlock all generic characters\nGrind levels to 9999(186,000 stored)\nGrind character weapon level\nGrind gear levels in the item world (30-100 floors per item)\nGet felonies on each character to 300(1% bonus xp per felony, more item world stuffs)\nCapture \"specialists\" in the item world to boost weapon stats(up to 19000)\nBeat all extra bosses\n\nOn the surface it may look like it would be a boring grind, but with so many things to do you can switch goals as SOON as you feel a bit bored of one. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a feeling of accomplishment in completing a goal you worked hard for, cause that's what this game is all about!", "timestamp_created": 1520238967, "timestamp_updated": 1520238967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40567017": {"recommendationid": "40567017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109247400", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503249344}, "language": "english", "review": "The story is simply tooooooo crappy!", "timestamp_created": 1520181739, "timestamp_updated": 1520181739, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.271156", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40496053": {"recommendationid": "40496053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073787222", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519932994}, "language": "english", "review": "Most fun I've had playing a JRPG in a loooong time.

But alas, I found this game not really to my liking. There is humor and references in this game, which I could enjoy. But combat didn't give me the FFT feeling that I was hoping for. Sadly, I feel a lot of time is being wasted will playing the game. Dialog is slow and can only be partially skipped even when you have already seen that part. Maneuvering your characters around the battlefield felt a bit too stilted. And managing your team members is incredibly annoying, given that there are 2 separate menus: 1 for equiping items and one for checking up on stats and 'special abilities'. And combat feels too stats driven, and less based on tactics. And there is a lot of stats related stuff in this game, from character to item stats. And all of them can (and propably need at some point, but I quite before that point) be upgraded. The idea I find interesting, but in terms of actual gameplay I grew stale pretty quickly.\n\nBut by biggest gripe with the item-leveling process is that you seem to be unable to save your progress inbetween. You MUST finish your run at a 10th level of the 'item dungeon'. For someone who has only limited time available in the evening, this really hampers my ability of using this feature in the game.\n\nIs it truely a bad game? Maybe not. But it doesn't fit my available free time (and when it motivates grinding, it feels it's definitly not respecting it) scheduling. So if limited gaming time isn't an issue, and you love grinding the rediculous amounts of mechanics in this game, this game might be something for you.

Endless hours of grinding and tongue in cheek humour, always enjoyable. Flipping to an older generation game like this as opposed to D2 or 6, you can definitely see where the game has aged and where theyve made significant strides in the newer games to fix and improve gameplay - it's a lot like getting sucked back in time. This and 1 are also my first times not playing Disgaea on a console like I'm used to.\n\nThat said as this is a PC port I expected more from this release with cleanup. I know the game is old but since they made the effort to clean and redo some of the icons and text boxes, etc, why not fix some of the textures like they did in the Disgaea 1 PC port? The images are incredibly blurry during gameplay, the actual sprites have 3 options for texture all of which are pretty bad, and I feel like more could have been done to shine it up a bit. It was jarring for the first few hours until I got too into it to care.\n\nIt might be because it's my first Disgaea game using a mouse, but the controls are damn awful on a lot of levels. The more elevation differences there are on a particular map, say in the Item World, the mouse cannot settle on certain areas and jumps erratically. It gives my hand a cramp trying to control things enough so I don't have to re-do them... which doesn't always work because some levels can take ages at a time just for control issues. I'm considering plugging in my PS4 controller for this afterall.\n\nThat all said, I'm happy to play it. I hadn't ever played 2 all the way through, and so much and so little has changed over the years, it's like returning to a familiar friend. I do hope they continue to port the rest over so I can play them all on PC as I have on console.", "timestamp_created": 1516948193, "timestamp_updated": 1516948193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 477, "total_negative": 40, "total_reviews": 517}}

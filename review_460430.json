It was long and detailed enough to develop a story in full (even tho as i already mention, to fully grasp the story and they whys and whens you really need 3 playthroughs) leaving some question marks on the way to facilitate the replayability of it (totally understandable, most visual novels that are non kinetic are made this way anyway)... it's really up to the player if to feel contempt with the story he got or if he/she wants more answer, another playthrough is due.\n\nThe very strong points of this VN imo are the voice acting (which is unbelievably good if you think this was a crowd funded indie game) and the soundtrack, which has real instruments playing in most of it, so it's not just some \"stupid\" copy/paste of bgm files, but small little songs thought,written and played by real people with real instruments (and being a musician myself, that will always be a major plus).\nThe story is nothing spectacular/new (cursed letter/mansion and the people involved have to try to break free from it) but it works as it is well acted and written.\n\nAll said and done i'd give this VN a solid 7/10, but given the fact is an indie crowd funded one (and that should not be the excuse to release half assed games) it's really a SOLID 8/10.\n\nIf you're a fan of horror, mystery, thriller and most importantly visual novels, please do buy this. I was extremely stupid not to take advantage of the discount during the steam winter sales (so i have paid the full 20 euros for it) but even so im not too mad as this game deserve every cent of it. I cannot wait to play the other game they soon plan to release, ill make sure to buy it as soon as it gets released.\n\nWell, off to the 3rd playthrough then!", "timestamp_created": 1516050002,

This game not only make you appreciate making choices, but also see their consequences several chapters after.\n\nCharacter writing is on point, and even if the concept of playing differents characters is nothing new, the Letter handles it better than many other game. You don't just scratch the surface when you go play another character, no, you embrace a whole new perspective and understanding of it.\n\nThere is obviously character development going along during the game, but I believe the greatest character development the game offers is for us : the player. You begin the game with a loose interest for the cast and end up trully caring for them and understanding their side of the story as the chapters unfold. You know you got something when the character I'm the most annoyed by, become my favorite and I go out of my way to ensure its survival when I was only planning for its death at the beggining of its chapter. \n\nWih that level of quality it saddens me that the game didn't received more recognition.

So, I wont/cant compare the Letter to other games in the genere, but others have probably already done that. \n\nAnyways: \nPlaying the Letter is the first time in a long time Ive played a game the same way I did when I was a kid. I finished the Letter in like 4 days, basicly doing nothing but playing it after work. It was a really enjoyable experience in many ways and I had tons of fun with my playthrough, even tho Im really not an anime-kindofguy. \n\nPros:\n-Likeable characters, if a little caricaturish at times. \n-Good music, really helps to establish the mood. \n-Good voiceacting, if a little bit \u2018over done\u2019 at times. \n-Good artwork. \n-Fun story.   \n-The choises I made seemd to really impact the story.  \n-Impactfull deathscenes. \n-Small animations in every scene made the whole thing feel more \u2018alive\u2019, and not just a row of static pictures. \n-Good audio design in general. \n\nCons:\n-At times, some of the voiceacting is a little difficult to listen to. I get that this might be an anime thing, kinda emulating japanese VO on some of the female characters, but at times Isabella and the kid(Luke and Hannahs god daughter, Im blanking on the name right now) is just to high pitch and shrieky. \n-Not all the characters are as interessting or fun to play, though that might change based on the choises you make, I dont know. A few of the chapters took a little time to grab me, but I ended up enjoying all of them. \n-I really like scary games. This isnt a scary game. I still really enjoyed it, but the \u2018scary\u2019 scenes were few and far between. That did give them more of an impact when they happened, and Ive might have gotten more of them had I made different choises, but based on my playthrough I found about 5% of this game a little creepy, and thats about it. \n-There are a few attempts at jumpscares, and those just dont work on me. Luckily the monster art was pretty good, so it was still fun when they happened, but they wernt scary. \n-Not too sure if this should be on the cons list, but the pacing is at times very obvious. After playing 3 hours, I could tell when the scares would come(before they did), because they seemed to happen at intervals which made them fairly obvious. It was very *talk to your friend, talk to your friend, think about something/go to work/whatever, talk to your friend then SCARYTIME!* again and again. It didnt bother me while playing, but it did take away some of the potential creepyness. \n-There are a few weird sentences, with repeat words and grammar mistakes, especially in Ash\u2019s chapter. That did kinda take me out of it at times, and I hope the Devs release a patch to fix it. Im not a grammar guy, neither is English my first language, but a few of them were really obvious and a some were just weird. This is not what the characters said in the game, but if someone told me \u2018hey, Im going on a bike, bike, ride\u2019 Id think them a little off, and I just dont get how mistakes like that wasnt fixed during testing. \n\nAnyways, even tho my con list seems a lot longer than the pro list, non of the negatives impacted how much I enjoyed The Letter in a big way. Having not really played many VN, I have no idea if my cons are unusual in these kinds of games, but whatever. Another thing I noticed, which is neither a pro nor con to me, is how politically correct this game tried to be. Yes, there are asshole characters saying asshole things, but they are clearly being painted as badguys and it felt a littlebit forced at times. \n\nIn the end, I havent enjoyd a \u2018single player experience\u2019 this much since DarkSouls3(the kind of game I usually play) was released, and I was so dissapointed when I googled the Devs and saw they were making a dating sim insted of another game like this. I did read some talk about a possible prequal tho, and I really hope it gets made obviously, so fingers crossed. \nIn the future, I will for sure play through this again. \n\nHeart: 10/10\nBrain: 8.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1515707455, "timestamp_updated": 1515708434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39246704": {"recommendationid": "39246704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083170460", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 328, "last_played": 1515986020}, "language": "english", "review": "The story starts really interesting, but as you have to see the same part of it AGAIN and AGAIN from each character's perspective, you grow kinda tired of it.

The Letter manages to do what Until dawn attempted, and failed miserably, at doing. \nThis small indie studio, did a much better job of making you care about the characters and actually feel for their safety. \nThe decisions you make not only decide whether your protagonist is going to live or not, but they also affect your characters relationships with other characters. It is much more like the walking dead in that regard. \nThe same story isn't rehashed each time the player controls a new character, but rather, the time moves forwards and backwards, filling in blanks and drip feeding piviotal parts to each character. It makes the story much more interesting and makes the player feel like they really make an impact with their decisions.\nEven looking at the flow chart for progression, it is incredibly complex. \nThe Characters seem very simple but as the player progresses, they show more of themselves, their insecurities, their fears. Characters that you originally hate end up worming their way into your heart so you don't want them to die. And if they do die, it can be upsetting. I only lost one character in my first play through but I actually considered giving up the game because I was so upset and angry with myself for letting her die. \nArt is something that I really appreciated. I often spent times just staring at a character's hair or watching the Character's facial expression change smoothly. Even just watching the hair or clothes move with a character was entertaining and added a depth to the characters. \nAnother thing that I noticed almost immediately is that the characters [i]breathe[/i]. It is a small thing but it makes a lot of difference. I could just go on and on about the quality of the art and the animations, but they would end up a book.\nAnother thing that adds a lot of depth to the characters is the voice acting. Aside from two minor characters being voiced by the same person and being noticeable, each character has their own voice, accent and distinct way of speaking. There is a lot of emotion that comes through, adding more immersion to the game. \nMusic is also very good. It was never grating, never annoying and seemed to always suit the mood.\nAs I said above, the letter does what Until Dawn tried to do. Where Until dawn went wrong and The letter got it oh so right is the characters. In Until dawn, I didn't care if people died. Most of the characters were terrible or annoying anyway. They were very stereotypical, which was probably on purpose. \nThe letter also handles things like fear and death in a very mature way. This game is definitely suited to adults, which is obvious when you consider the Protagonists are all in their mid to later 20's.\n\nNegatives\nQuick Time Events\n\nPositives\nYou can turn off QTE\nInteresting Characters that you actually care about\nAmazing Story\nMind blowing animations (when I first saw that the characters were animated, I was literally blown away)\nSuperb voice acting\nGreat ST\n\nTL:DR\nYou'll actually care about these fictional people in this amazing game/Visual Novel", "timestamp_created": 1515044696, "timestamp_updated": 1515044696, "voted_up": true,

After one playthrough, I admit that I know very little about the 'horror lurking about' so gives the game lots of replayability and choosing one option over the other has very large consequences.\n\nThe voice acting in this game is fantastic as well as the story.

Allow me to explain...\n\n{TLDR\n\n1) Narrative is amateurishly written and reads more like fan-fiction\n2) Few actual choices\n3) Characters cliched and completely unbelievable\n4) Artwork is technically fine but subverts the intended horror atmosphere\n}\n\nFirstly, the biggest turn-off is that, as one other reviewer has noted, the writing violates the rule of \"show don't tell\" at every opportunity. For example, right off the intro gives us a shot of Ermangarde Mansion and informs us that it is haunted/ cursed and that we had better be careful. Much of the narrative is constructed similarly: we are repeatedly told how we (the character) feel, and NPCs expressions and mannerisms are described even though we can see and listen for ourselves.\n\nActually, this leads me to my second point: the narrative is incredibly tedious and boring. Similarly to the violation of \"show don't tell\" the protagonist repeatedly describes what she's feeling and why. For example, we are soon introduced to one character that the protagonist states is \"very serious\", \"tall\", and \"commands respect\". Here's another example: at one point, Isabella is lectured by Rebecca for mostly eating junk food (Ramen noodles, specifically). Rebecca then offers to lend Isabella money so she can eat better. OK, these interactions suggest long-standing character bonds and that Rebecca sincerely cares for the wellbeing of Rebecca. The problem is that Isabella spells all this out in her internal monologue. \n\nClunky and inorganic descriptions like these shouldn't be necessary. If the writing is good we will know how the character feels without being told. Moreover, the dialogue is heavily diluted by exposition and background. I would figure that even in dialogue there's about 3-5 sentences of exposition for every sentence of dialogue. While some exposition can be helpful and better frame character interactions, the degree to which it occupies the scene in \"The Letter\" prevents me from becoming fully engaged.\n\nSpeaking of engagement, there are a couple of other roadblocks to immersion and suspension of disbelief. Firstly, all of the characters are cardboard cutout cliches and secondly, all the characters introduced thus far would better fit into some sort of teen drama: with a few exceptions all but one of the voiced characters look, speak, and act as teens. In fact, when we are first introduced to the main character , Isabella, and her friend, Rebecca, they are chatting at the High School. It wasn't until about half-way through the dialogue that I learned we weren't students: I (Isabella) am a realtor visiting her teacher friend on lunch break. \n\nLastly, much of the writing itself severely needs polish. I haven't noticed any typos, but the writing would benefit from a more diverse vocabulary while cutting out a bunch of unnecessary fluff-words. For example, Isabella is a realtor trying to sell a 17th century mansion that has been abandoned for centuries to \"modern-day lords and ladies\". \"Modern-day\" is a trite phrase and could just be replaced alltogether by modern. This is a small thing, but weighs down the writing if spread out over seven hundred thousand words.\n\nAfter only a few minutes into the game I started looking at my clock and feeling that my life was slipping away.", "timestamp_created": 1514841148, "timestamp_updated": 1514841148, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.420952", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38921311": {"recommendationid": "38921311", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162698927", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 31, "last_played": 1515851608}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow.

"english", "review": "Disclaimer: as of the time of writing this review, I have only reached Chapter 4; however, I believe I have experienced enough to get the general gist of this game.\n\n\nAlright, so...The Letter. An interesting visual novel, and I'm definitely enjoying playing it. So let's dig into the good and bad, shall we?\n\nFirst off, if you are a fan of horror - true horror - then this probably isn't for you; at least as far as the end of the third chapter, most of the horror stems from jumpscares and a fairly generic scary zombie-ghost lady. If you are already familiar with or desensitised to these things, this VN will not scare you.  I somewhat came into this knowing that, since I cannot stomach true horror, so it suited my tastes perfectly.\n\nHowever, if you have never played a visual novel, or you have only played a small number before (as I have), I woluld recommend this one regardless; there is a certain quality to it which I am not used to in VNs. Namely, the animation of the character models making them feel more \"alive\", and the voice acting, which is so top-notch that on a couple of occasions I thought it was done by one of those dubbing companies like Funimation. Which is high praise, believe me.\n\nMoving on to the graphical design, on the whole, the locations look wonderful and there are several shots which are stunning and really improve the experience. That said, there are some notable flaws; in some places, such as Zachary's apartment or a particular indoor shot of the mansion ballroom, the perspective can at times be a little wonky, with certain objects not matching the perspective of the surface they are on. Additionally, although the game is (seemingly) set in the United Kingdom, no buildings resemble British architecture, the school background shows individual seats and desks which are so exceedingly rare in the UK that I'm not even sure we still use that system outside of examinations, and for some reason a hospital in the background of one shot had a large red cross on it, which is highly unusual at best (the cross is also drawn to look more like a crucifix, though admittedly this may have been an attempt to not get sued by The Red Cross organization, who are infamously, ridiculously, litigious on the use of \"their symbols\"). Additionally, some shots involving multiple characters seem to have made the characters not look at each other or stare off into space when they are meant to look at each other.\n\nThe character designs are all quite good. Others have stated they resemble those weird online flash games featuring barbies or disney princesses, but I would argue that is not a bad thing; the style is good, and in those weird online flash games, often their only saving grace. In The Letter's case, it is just another good thing in the VN. No design feels bad, nothing seems particularly out of place, and they all feel full of life regardless.\n\nAs for the story itself? I for one enjoy most of the writing. It's not bad, it's not amazing, but it's good. This actually surprised me considering that on the pre-titles disclaimer greeted me with warnings about things being \"triggering\", terminology which I feel did the VN a disservice. I also dislike that it unironically used the phrase \"People of Colour\" at one point in chapter 2 (a phrase which I feel is no better than a similar phrase from 40 odd years ago which today is deemed politically incorrect), however both of these things are, as of the time of writing this, one-off occurances that only warrant mentioning for why I was initially wary of the game and where it might go. \n\nHowever, when it comes to the story paths, I must admit they feel a little lacking. Most decisions are focused only around your relationships with other characters - and while these can affect how your story route goes, most  feel fairly minor. \n\nSo anyway; The Letter - Horror Visual Novel. Should you buy it?\n\nPersonally, I would say yes. Despite some of its flaws, it has been a fun ride so far, and I definitely want to continue to see the rest of the story and routes.", "timestamp_created": 1514029492, "timestamp_updated": 1514029492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.638902", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38524993": {"recommendationid": "38524993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272747457", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514127141}, "language": "english", "review": "The Letter is my favorite Visual Novel.

If you are a visual novel lover like me then I recommend this game to you 100% because it really is something new in my point of view.

So if you are a scaredy cat like me and Belle then you should get just enough excitement in your life from this.\n\nAlso loved how different each character was. And all the possible couples. And multiple endings. This game hooks you. You need to fill up all the blank spaces you have in the story. Only con I can actually think of is that the story left me just hanging.

As both a fan of horror and visual novels, I'm used to lowering my standards and giving the creators a pass because these two things are difficult to do RIGHT and you can't acount for everyone's taste but THIS GAME. It went above and beyond. You can see how much its developers cared about it. They put their attention in the details. They put their love into the characters. They put blood and sweat into the writing and it absolutely shows. For a small team, this is an incredible achievement and it's a beautiful game. \n\nYou may question the price point, because generally VN games are cheap and easy to produce, but this game is absolutely worth its cost. The character portraits, CGs and backgrounds are all animated. The game is fully voice acted (and extremely well done). The music is fantastic. The QTE's spice up the story and add a bit of challenge to what is otherwise mostly a passive reading experience. The devs worked their asses off to make this game stand out and it worked. I loved it.\n\nAnd for me personally, I am so, so happy to see a game with a culturally diverse and queer cast. Three of the seven protags are people of colour. Two of the ladies are bisexual. My utmost favourite character is the scarily competant butler who is happily married to his husband while they raise two kids together. None of this is sensationalised, and yet they're not unimportant or 'tacked on' details. They're just part of what makes these characters who they are: complex and fully realised.\n\nThe first chapter may feel a bit slow due to the need to introduce all the main players and the plot, and maybe by chapter 5 you'll find yourself feeling impatient because HOW DOES THIS END, WHAT IS AT THE HEART OF THIS MYSTERY, but it's the kind of impatience that leaves you hungry for more. There's so much to discover among the choices and concequences of each story branch, a single playthrough isn't nearly enough. You'll come back again and again, teasing out a little more of the story each time.  It's the kind of horror you need multiple runs at, picking it apart, unravelling it a bit more each time. \n\nObviously if you're not into VNs this probably won't be for you, but definitely if you're a fan of horror and creative story telling I fully reccomend it. At the very least, watch the sweet anime trailer and see if it tickles your interest.\n\nPros: \n- Awesome non-linear, compelling story\n- Fantastic characters that mostly avoid the horror stereotypes and tropes\n- Great music and sound design\n- Gorgeous art\n- Sweet extras. There's a relationship chart, character profiles, image allery, music room, narrative map...lots of tools to hunt down all the achievements or just play around with.\n\nCons\n- I suppose for a 'horror' game it's not overtly scary. This isn't the kind of game that'll have you sitting on the edge of your seat with adrenaline pumping through your veins. Rather, it's the slow, unsettling horror that comes when someone bites into that beautiful looking meat pie and you realise it's full of bloody chunks of hair and gore. \n- Some heavy exposition in places, mostly in the first chapter, but you're much more inclined to forgive it later when you've become attached to the characters and just watching them interact is its own pleasure regardless of what they're doing.", "timestamp_created": 1511860034, "timestamp_updated": 1511860034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.649442", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37793196": {"recommendationid": "37793196", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995730740", "num_games_owned": 390, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 965, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513735905}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool story with complex characters.

The devs really love this project and took their time in making it. I usually only play VNs to have a shitty story to read while drinking, but this really shocked me by how great it was. The characters were so well done, even the ones I wasn't particularly fond of I had an attatchment to at the end. The voice acting startled me at first since I wasn't really used to it, but it quickly grew on me. I locked myself up for days playing nothing but this until I had finished nearly everything possible. It's been several months since I played this game, and I keep wishing there was still more for me to go back to. I get a little smile on my face every time I see it in my library. But there's a hell of a lot of content, which is awesome. The gore is absolutely great,-possibly my favorite part- the art is very spot-on (although I noticed there were a few minor hair color changes), and best of all, when messed up shit is happening, the characters actually act believable. The QTEs aren't at all challenging apart from some minor frustrations I had with a certain flashlight scene, and if you don't like them they're skippable. There was a really great element of suspense in this VN and I actually got spooked several times while playing it. I was really impressed by all the characters reactions and rationale. My one criticism is that the ending seemed rather lackluster compared to everything else. Isabella's routes set the bar really high, so I was expecting for the end to have more of a grandiose finale.

And I\u2019m looking forward to more games from Yangyang Mobile in the future! \nWhy do I give such high praise to The Letter? Because out of all visual novels I\u2019ve played over the years The Letter has become one of my all-time favourites due to that fact that it really makes all the choices you make in the game matter! The Letter is a horror visual novel in the style of East Asian ghost horror films such as The Ring and Ju-On: The Grudge, and the malevolent spirit throughout the game is reminiscent of the spirits in those films as well having some unexpected tricks up its sleeve. The game has seven chapters where you play each one of the seven main characters. At the end of each chapter the choices you made determine the fate of the character. \nI enjoyed the story, and most of all the characters! I felt the characters were interesting, had good designs and were well developed. I couldn\u2019t help but feel sympathy for them for the horrible situations they were in.    \nThe art (the CGI is the best looking in terms of both beauty and horror) and music do a great job bringing an atmospheric horror tone to the game. I loved the music so much that I even bought soundtrack when it came available! In my first playthrough I was always on edge waiting for the next scare or for one of my choices to bring misfortune to the character I was playing in each chapter. \nI do mean it when I say the choices you make in The Letter really feel like they matter, with emphasis on building or destroying the relationships between the characters, and the many different consequences as a result of your actions kept me replaying the game to find all the branching paths. There\u2019s also a tab in the game that helps you keep track of all the branches of each chapter you have unlocked and are yet to unlock. The gameplay also has Quick-Time-Events that can help ramp up the tension and horror, but be warned, I recommend starting on the easy level as normal difficulty can be tough if you don\u2019t have good reflexes! The QTEs are completely optional, i.e. clicking the tab button to skip the QTE or setting to automatically skip QTEs in the options menu at any time.\nI highly recommend this game for lovers of horror and visual novels \ud83d\ude0a If you\u2019re not sure try the demo of the game as it covers the whole of the first chapter. \n", "timestamp_created": 1511557757, "timestamp_updated": 1511557757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37318556": {"recommendationid": "37318556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148672528", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511361122}, "language": "english", "review": "I am very picky with games.

It does set the standard for how a visual novel should be produced however the actual writing side of the game can get fustrating. With a lot of exposition especially when you're playing over the same time-frame as a previous character, you feel like you're having to skip alot to get to 'the good bits'. It's also worth noting that whilst this game looks like a full on horror fest, it actually is second to the main narrative which is character relationships (this could be good or bad depending on what you want from the game). The concept is brilliant and I do recommend it to someone who wants to explore a new visual novel game.\n\nMINOR SPOILERS\nOne thing that I was disappointed in was the horror element. There are some great moments and some fantatsic CG created for the spirit, but the whole premise of the game was built around a letter, that in the end, it was never really fleshed out as much as I thought it was.

Just take off about 1-3 hrs because I may have fallen asleep playing it or had to pause the game to do something.\n\nThe game follows the cliche of the danger of chain mails, but here's the kicker, it actually kills you! Yes, our poor Isabella has the misfortune of picking up said letter and her friends (plus strangers) saw it. Now you got a vengeful spirit who is bent on killing everyone, except for that one guy. Basically, a reject grudge who doesn't need a well or tv to function its curse.\n\nEvery choice you make does count and it can lead to small or big variations in your gamethrough. The butterfly effect does its job -coughsunlikeuntildawncoughs- ! There are some errors with the audio matching with what the characters say or its not even there when they are talking, but I think it's more at the end for that. Could've worked more on the branch tree because it is super confusing to look at.\n\nThe characters' personalities are amazing and I love them all. Although, I have a love and hate relationship with Rebecca, Luke, and Ashton (kinda redeem himself in his route, but the 1st chapter, was a nonono). Seriously, some of the characters will grow on you and seeing them get killed really makes me sad ; ^ ;  The BG, voice acting, animation,  journals, other extra features are a major plus as well!\n\nSpoilers FYI\n[spoiler] In the epilogue for Luke's route when he killed Hannah, why didn't it mention anything about it?? Like throughout his route, he talked about how much he regrets killing her so why in the epilogue, it wasn't even mention?! I thought he would, at least, have a grave for her and apologize for being such a terrible husband and you know, killing their unborn children as well!! Just kinda disappointed that something so important wasn't even in the epilogue and why in the world did the other characters want to be near him when the ghost literally told that he killed his wife...

Visual novel, and with interactive i mean you'll have some interesting  Qte and events while you'll have to fight for your survival ( [spoiler] fuck the elevator one though, horribly done [/spoiler]) that has a great and captivating story, and amazing sound design, english dub included that makes every scene more characteristic ad sucessfully help in giving it life, i just finished getting my first ending and it seems like i missed quite alot of things, apparently good ending were they all survive and live happy aren't so much interesting, i apparently have still alot of playing to do before making this review more exhaustive and precise but i can say, whitout doubt, even with still things left unanswered ( yet to play, cause i know they're there)  unknown, i am quite happy with this game,.\n\n\nI must also point out i had stopped playing VN along time ago, after i  finished  Saya no uta ( another great one,) , i kinda lost the will of even getting into another one, losing hope of some other one topping that off, i discovered this masterpiece while on my usual searching in the store, i examined the previews, the screens and filtered every single available information in the store page ( as i always do before buying anything) and i decided to give it a shot, because even so  in some way i felt sure i won't be left disappointed by The Letter, and boy was i right, thank you Yangyang Mobile, \n\n[please make more.]\n\n\n\nTl;dr: \n\nOver all The letter was one of the best VN i've ever played and i've really enjoyed it, best thing is, i still have to play and unlock

I adore jumpscares with screeching sounds. Flashing blood overlays give me the heebie jeebies. And not only *horror* tropes -- every character fit nicely into a VN cliche as well as they fit into their mood-upsetting, colorful anime designs. You've got the aloof detective, the rich bitch and his charming blonde wifey, the gentle giant, the bitchy childhood bestfriend, etc. You've also get their incredibly non-original backstories and overall plot -- seriously, who needs another story about rich white lady who resents her cheating husband? \n\n(Me, apparently.)\n\nI don't know if The Letter is so tropey it's endearing, or if it executes the tropes too damn well. A bit of both, I'd wager. \n\nThe CGs are nicely done, though I haven't the faintest idea of how someone can effectively turn those childish designs into horror gorefests so well (the original designs for the sprites are... really bad. the clothes fit to the characters like swimsuits and they have details like giant buttons and stuff, it's overall distracting, even if the characters are well animated and their little gestures contribute to immersion). I'd say it actually helps a little. They're certainly creepy as fuck.\n\nSo far, though, the best thing that The Letter does is really delivering on the promise of a branching storyline. I've been shocked, more than once, to find that my actions have real consequences. So far I managed to off two characters -- and two characters I damn liked, too, to boot! It made me upset enough not to change their fates. Seriously, the game delivered on that. The stories are entwined, but not enough that replaying through previous events gets boring, and not enough that getting someone killed prevents them from appearing in the next chapter, making the heartache even better.\n\nThe little extras, like the journal (the first game where a journal actually felt necessary, giving that the story goes back and forth), the unlocking of memories when you get someone killed (do I want them to die? really?), the items and CG gallery... There's obvious a fuckton of effort, and it's very fun to explore.\n\nDef. an interesting game and one of the best EVNs I've played, in terms of content.", "timestamp_created": 1508018076, "timestamp_updated": 1508018076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35704998": {"recommendationid": "35704998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006007948", "num_games_owned": 829, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508442884}, "language": "english", "review": "Visual novels tend to give me mixed feelings - on one hand, potential, on the other hand, disappointment.  I tend to steer clear of them because they're often really overpriced and I'll likely hate them anyway.\nBuuut - I played Doki Doki Literature Club because it was free and I wanted to see if it earned the Psychological Horror tag steam gave it, or if it was just the kind of thing bored people put on overly cute games when they think they're being ironic.  And it surprised me with it's awesomeness.  But it was quite short and I couldn't see a lot of replay value that wouldn't involve re-reading almost everything.  \nI remembered The Letter from when I'd wishlist it idly browsing through the horror tag - it looked interesting, but the VN tag really put me off, especially at the \u00a315 price.  But after Doki Doki, I wanted something similar-ish, and The Letter looked just the thing.\n7 hours later, there's still a fair portion of the game to go, and I really don't think I can recommend it enough.  It's undeniably creepy and atmospheric, maybe a bit slow burning for some horror fans, but the length of the game and the multiple viewpoints really let the story stretch its legs in a way you can't really pack into a 90 minute movie.  It's maybe a little derivative, [spoiler] being very like The Grudge [/spoiler] but it's involving and well written, with good graphics, sound and voice acting and it's well worth the \u00a315, being about the same as you'd pay for a hardback book for something you'll probably enjoy more.  On sale, it'd be a steal, but it rarely is.  Maybe for halloween.\nIt's not perfect, as some of the grammar seems a little off, with a slightly weird mix of past and present tenses at times, but that's not a problem for most people - I only mention it at all because that kind of thing reminds me that I'm only reading a story as opposed to being immersed in it.  It's a personal thing.  \nSo if you're looking for something creepy around halloween that will reliably give you a scare without too much tension, read this.  If you like horror but aren't sure about a VN style game, read this.  If you're emotionally dead inside and want something you can be proud to say didn't move you at all, even if it did, read this.  If you can read, read this.  If you can't read, learn to read, or get someone to read it to you.  If you're blind, get your dog or monkey to read this.  Read this.  Read it.  How many more times?  Read it, damnit.  Read it.\n\nEdit:  22 hours later and finally got the True Ending - word of warning, all the other endings I've seen are a massive anti-climax to a great story.  Which, in a way, only made me more determined to see the True Ending.

It was quite the emotional ride. If there would be something to improve on, that would be the horror aspect of the game. It's like a drama VN with a ghost popping up from time to time.

Your small choices affects your entire playthrough.\n+ Awesome Characters and amusing interactions/events between them. [spoiler]Some of my personal favs are Rebecca's death scene and Ashton's breakdown after Isabella's death. [/spoiler]\n\nNegatives: \n- I personally think the endings were a bit of a letdown after all those heavy moments. (Yes including the True ending) [spoiler]It was a bit disappointing that after all those tension and such, you'll find out that they can be saved by just burning the letter or the mansion without any resistance from the ghost. I was at least expecting that they'll get to see the past, like a deeper version of Luke's hallucination in the ballroom. [/spoiler]\n\n- The Horror part of the game needs improvement in my opinion. \n[spoiler] Maybe it could have been better if the writers added more depth to the mystery. If the lady was the one who made the letter, why does destroying the letter spares the main characters from the curse? How was the curse created?

There are times when I wish Steam had a sliding scale rather than just \"positive\" or \"negative\" reviews, since this one is mixed and I would only recommend it to certain people.\n\nFirst, the positives: this game is definitely a labor of love, making it one of the best looking and most dynamic VNs I've ever played. A lot of attention and detail was put into crafting the story and world, as well as fleshing out the characters. I know some reviews have mentioned there's some racist and homophobic language in some of the routes, but they are in keeping with the characters they've established as the cast is actually very diverse racially and sexually, something not often seen in VNs. At the same time, they don't make race or sexuality the entirety of the characters' identity,  they just acknowledge that people's experiences are going to influence their lives and how they view the world.\n\nThe voice acting is top notch, and the developers are very open and friendly and responsive to feedback, looking to continually improve the game even after its release. One really gets a feel they are genuinely just as thrilled by each fan of the game they attract as the fans are for having found it. The could just take the \"positive\" rating they currently hold for the game on Steam and rest on their laurels, but they truly want to make the game as great an experience for everyone as possible, even opening a public Discord server (that is linked to their social media).\n\nThe story is engaging, even addictive at times. It's really like a soap opera, where no matter what happens, you find yourself wanting to know more. The fact that your choices have so much influence on the game, from beginning to end, makes repeated playthroughs feel almost like entirely different games. You can reveal dozens of paths, outcomes, and ending scenarios depending on how you choose to play right from the very first chapter on. There are lots of things to help you keep track of your progress, from branching trees to relationship charts to a journal that keeps a timeline of all the events as they happen and you view things from different characters' perspectives.\n\nSo now the not so great parts: as a \"horror story\", it sort of falls flat. If you're looking for a VN with non-stop tension and horror like Corpse Party, you'll be disappointed, as it seems to be more of a slice-of-life drama where a ghost story is looming vaguely in the background and once in a while, the ghost will pop up to inject unexpected horror. The scares are pretty effective when they happen, but they don't happen very often, and seem to happen less so as the story goes on.\n\nSome of the story is extremely overwritten. The length could have easily been reduced if a lot of unnecessary dialogue and reptition were trimmed from the narrative portions, which could have offered more time to flesh out the ghost story. This seems to get worse over time, really getting bad around chapter five and lasting until the end of the game. A lot of time is spent meandering around the plot, whether it's the horror portion or the personal interactions, sacrificed in favor of discussions of topics like interior design and food (a lot of food shows up in this game, actually. I joke it excels more in food porn than horror).\n\nIn all, I'd say if you're already a fan of VNs and looking for one that mixes slice-of-life with a little bit of horror for Halloween, then you'll probably enjoy this a lot. However, if you don't have a lot of patience for overwritten narratives and character drama and just want something that goes straight into horror and focuses on it, you'll likely be very disappointed. Those who do get and enjoy it, though, won't be disappointed with the amount of content there is to explore and how many different ways there are to play (that high number of achievements isn't just for show, you really do have to try and steer the story around to get many of them).", "timestamp_created": 1507479634, "timestamp_updated": 1507518504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615044", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35493824": {"recommendationid": "35493824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300458827", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507337748}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f60\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u4ee5\u628a\u5b83\u5f53\u505a\u4e00\u6b3e\u604b\u7231\u6e38\u620f\u6765\u73a9\n\u4f46\u662f\u5982\u679c\u6253\u771f\u7ed3\u5c40\u2026\u2026\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6545\u4e8b\u5c31\u6bd4\u8f83\u60b2\u4f24\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1507206040, "timestamp_updated": 1507206040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35484634": {"recommendationid": "35484634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036122655", "num_games_owned": 478, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507169529}, "language": "english", "review": "The only vn I've had the patience to finish and I'm sure glad I did.\nI've done 4 total runs looking at different options and endings and I think I'm ready to share my thoughts.\n\nPros+\nGreat characters to either love or hate\nAn interesting story that brings western and eastern horror together\nThe alternate paths in this game are detailed and worth pursuing\nThe art style is high quality and holds throughout\nNo cheap jumpscares\n\nCons-\nSome of the endings feel stilted if you don't go for the \"true ending\" (Though I still encourage you to play 1 run blind)\nThe real backstory is hidden behind finding different paths where you get \"memory fragments\n\n+/-\nThe voice acting isn't top tier but the voices grew on me after a while\n\nIn conclusion\nI would encourage any fan of horror or vns to pick up this game, it is a great ride.

I have yet to see a game with such effort put into the character development, and more or less you will relate to these characters in one way or another. To put it simply, it is truely an amazing experience and watching some video somewhere does this game a massive deservice, its an experience you cannot rob yourself of.\nMy only gripes lay in the bugs this game, like all, is unfortunately riddled with. From audio refusing to play, to audio playing but missing the overlapping effect and so on. I am happily waiting for the music room to be released, the music and audio ques make the experience even more so perfect.\nI just realised how kind of kiss-ass this whole review seems, To be fair its a glorified visual novel that actually animates the scene and characters and cements the feeling that they are real by giving them actual voices and unique character thoughts.

Well: get the new one! This game is complete and outer shit with almost NO redimin qualities. I hate every second of it, I hate it's creators, I hate it's fans, because their rude and silly people! The plot overoll is moronic, characters are very bland, lore are very inconsistent. Graphics and music are mostly nice, but Kayley for instence is incredibly ugly, eventhough she supposed to be \"imbodiment of child's innocence\" and \"Luke's good half\", as I see. Also the game is buggy as all Hell. Please-please don't buy it.  It will hurt you and you may never recover. I had buy it and I regret. I had deleted it from my account, eventhough it's sadly to late for me to get my money back. But, you still have a chance. Please, don't waste any of it. Don't be stupid, like I was, then I buy it. You can play some good visual novels, don't waste your time on this crap! \n\n\u0417\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u0442 \u0442\u0430\u043a, \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0442\u0435\u0445, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439: \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0440\u044f\u043d\u044c \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0451 \u043d\u0438 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0435\u043c \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e. \u0421\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0439, \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435, \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0441 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u043d\u043e\u0440\u043c, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u0439 \u0430\u0431\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043b\u0438\u0432\u044b (\u0432\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u041a\u0430\u0439\u043b\u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u044f \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044e \u043e\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0443\u044e \u043d\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0443\u044e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0443 \u041b\u044e\u043a\u0430). \u042d\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0443\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u044e \u0432\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442. \u041c\u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c, \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044c \u044f \u0438 \u0443\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0441 \u0430\u043a\u043a\u0430\u0443\u043d\u0442\u0430, \u0430 \u0443 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0448\u0430\u043d\u0441. \u041c\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0437\u044b\u0432 \u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b \u043a\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u043c\u044f\u0433\u0447\u0435, \u043d\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0442 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442 \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043c\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u044f \u0438\u0441\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0443 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443, \u0435\u0451 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u0444\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u041e\u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0436\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u0438\u0445 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u0439 \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c, \u0430 \u0443 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0448\u0430\u043d\u0441 \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438, \u043d\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0435\u0451, \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0443\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0434\u043e 14 (\u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0451\u0442 \u0432\u0440\u044f\u0434 \u043b\u0438, \u043d\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u0436\u0435). \u0415\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0432\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043b -

I have played through it three times now to get different endings. I am a big fan of text-based adventure games in general so I was excited to play this one, and it does have a lot of choices that affect the direction of the story, so that's its strong point.\n\nIt's not scary at all. The \"bad guy\" pops up occasionally to offer up some jump scares, so if you are easily frightened then maybe you will find it horror-like, but that part was really disappointing, particularly since I'm a big fan of Japanese horror films as well. Plus the animation is so cartoony that it detracts from any horror elements that are present.\n\nAlso, a lot of the story and dialogue is childish and focuses a lot on long rambling internal monologues about what one character thinks about another. I think a preteen might enjoy that kind of thing, but as someone who is nearly 30 I found it really tedious and unnecessary to the story. The creators should have focused a lot more on the horror aspect of this game instead of creating what feel like diary entries to take up more time. It just feels like filler to me.\n\nI think if you are 12 and really interested in fictional romances, this game will be perfect for you. Otherwise it is definitely not worth the $20, but the creators have potential and if they can learn to focus on cutting out filler dialogue/story and focus on staying true to their genre, I think they could make something worthwhile.", "timestamp_created": 1505057564, "timestamp_updated": 1505057750, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542434", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34850500": {"recommendationid": "34850500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098105507", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509749782}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful story, beautiful animation, art music, everything about this game just makes me enjoy it more!

Strap yourselves in, ladies and gentleman. This review is going to be a long one. It's also my first review on Steam, so I hope I can do this game justice.\n\nThe Letter is a horror visual novel developed by YangYang Mobile, a small team from the Philippines. It takes a lot of inspiration from J-Horror staples like The Ring, and Corpse Party. That said, my attention was drawn to this right away. \n\nI'll open the meat of the review by saying this much. A couple of years back when this game was being crowdfunded through Indiegogo I strongly considered supporting it, but I backed out at the last minute. I regret that decision after looking at (and playing) the finished product.\n\n\n[h1] Plot Outline [/h1]\n\nNow, the story itself is explored out of order, and you play as seven different characters, each one distinct and unique, as they endure a curse placed upon them when one of the protagonists finds a letter within an old 17th century British mansion. Most of these protagonists are either friends or connected by work in some way.\n\nOutside of that much (basically the first twenty minutes) there isn't much else I can say in terms of story because it's driven entirely by your choices as the player from that point onward. It's on that note I'll start discussing one of the game's finest points, freedom of choice.\n\n[h1] Freedom of Choice [/h1]\n\nOh boy, here we go, the fabled section about freedom of choice. How many times have we been here, guys and girls? How many times have we gone into a game expecting our choices to matter? You know the kind of games I'm talking about. All too often we're led to believe that the things our protagonist does effect the story, when sadly the outcome is already set. Only the path to reach the outcome is able to change slightly.\n\nI am happy to report, however, that this is not the case in The Letter. Yes, you heard me right. Your choices do matter, and I'll explain why. Between you and I, this is one of the reasons I had such a deep enjoyment of the game.\n\nThere is no illusion of choice here. Every choice you make, even the tiny ones, holds a weighted and measured impact upon the overall progression of the plot and your relationships with other characters. Here's an example:\n\nSay if character A is needs to do something important at a later stage of the game. Well, he or she may need help to do that, and if you got character D killed in some horrible manner during their respective chapter, they won't be there to help. This in turn could lead to character A getting hurt or worse, gruesomely maimed. Yes, the choice system is deep and winding. Just looking at the route map for each character (especially the last two) was a little overwhelming.\n\nYou can skip, miss out, or have entirely different scenarios play out through your choices, with each character having a solid handful of different endings to their chapter depending on the things you did. Sounds detailed right? Yep. Your every choice rolls over to following chapters, and that one tiny choice you made in chapter one can effect a chunk of somebody's story in chapter three.\n\nThe point I'm getting at? Tread carefully if you don't want your characters to die. Yes, character death and injury are both things here. If people die the story will change. Everything you do matters. Honestly, it's one of the best VN's I've played for the way it handles its decision tree.\n\n[h1] Animation/Art [/h1]\n\nBoth the backgrounds and characters are animated and expressive. Characters move their hands/turn their bodies and their facial expressions change. It makes the whole experience feel so much more alive when compared to the VN's of earlier days. Art is also wonderfully detailed. Lighting plays a heavy part here, too. Dark surroundings (when something nasty is afoot) feel suffocating and hopeless, while brightly lit scenes feel crisp and fresh.\n\n[h1] Voice Acting + Music [/h1]\n\nThe game is fully voice acted, with every piece of spoken dialogue narrated by a VA. It's all done to a very high standard, too. True, the odd line here and there might sound a little corny at times, but what do you expect from a horror game? Need I bring up the truly amazing voice acting of Resident Evil 1 on the original PlayStation?\n\nI'd say nine out of ten times the voice cast nail it. Some people might cringe at one or two of the American VA's trying to put on a decent English accent, which most of the time they do, aside from a few mispronounced words here and there. Overall, however, it only adds to the experience. How many visual novels have full (good quality) voice acting?\n\nThe game's music works almost too well at setting the scene, and I especially love the song 'Letters Goodbye' that plays during the animated opening. Look it up on YouTube. It's great.\n\n[h1] Characters [/h1]\n\nThere are seven main characters throughout the game. Instead of talking in detail about each, one I'll put a list below and give a short summary.\n\n[h1]Isabella Santos[/h1]  A Filipino real estate agent who moved to England to support her family back home.\n\n[h1]Hannah Wright[/h1]  A wealthy heiress who's kind-hearted and extremely loving beneath her aloof surface.\n\n[h1]Zachary 'Zach' Steele[/h1]  An American photographer who moved to England at a younger age to live with his grandparents.\n\n[h1]Marianne McCullough[/h1]  An Irish interior designer who works for the Wrights in the story.\n\n[h1]Rebecca Gales[/h1]  A Scottish high school teacher and friend to Ashton since their teen years.\n\n[h1]Ashton Frey[/h1]  A strong but caring private investigator who's friends with Zach, Isabella and Rebecca.\n\n[h1]Luke Wright[/h1]  Husband to Hannah. A cold businessman with a powerful grip over the local town.\n\n\nYes, this is a diverse cast alright. Both in terms of their backgrounds, their jobs and their personalities. Now I can't say much about their character interactions aside from the pre-established ones, because most of the interactions in game are down to you as the player. These also play a very important part in the game. In fact, character interactions and relationships make up a large chunk of the game's choice system.\n\nYou may be interested to know that the game also has some small romantic elements. too. So, those of you who like character pairings? Yep, the option is there. I must stress however, that it's not the core focus of the game. It's more a side note based upon how you have one character react around another, but it definitely adds a nice touch.\n\nNow let's move onto the horror side of things.\n\n\n[h1] Horror Element [/h1]\n\nOur villainess in the game takes the form of a supernatural spirit/creature tormented by rage and pain. She's very close to something out of The Ring, and while it's not her concept that's unique, the way she carries herself makes her a very frightening foe.\n\nShe will hunt you endlessly - her presence will make you tense.\n\nIn short, the game doesn't rely on simple jump scares to get under the player's skin. It uses atmosphere.\n\n[h1] Drawbacks [/h1]\n\nWhile I really enjoy this game, it's not perfect. There are still grammatical errors that need ironing out. The developers have promised these will be fixed soon but right now, they're still in game, and this review is based on the game in its current state. There are still some missing spoken lines that don't match text on screen as well.\n\n[h1] Final Score [/h1]\n\nDespite its small issues the Letter is still an amazing game and I'd highly recommend you buy it. Heck, even if you can't buy it, download the free demo and give it a try. Spread the word to other fans of horror and visual novels as well. I'd love to see this game pick up a strong cult following and be recognized. I'm half tempted to write a FanFiction continuation based on the ending I got because I didn't wait it to end! ;)\n\n[h1] 8/10 [/h1] \n\nOne of my favorite games this year, but the grammar needs fixing.\n\nI hope my review was helpful and informative.

Maybe a bit longer than is the norm, but my husband and I love to voice act the 'thought' portions of the game, so we take our time with the game. \n\n+ Most characters have a unique and interestering personality and background (though I can't stand Rebecca...).\n+ Lots of choices throughout the game.\n+ Choices matter. A choice you made in chapter one is going to affect your whole playthrough.\n+ Overall great voice acting.\n+ The monster/antagonist (however you want to call her) is truly scary. There is a great progression in the fear she instills in the player and the characters alike. \n+ Great CGs.\n+ Every QTE is different and therefore more interesting than simple repetition. Also you can skip them. \n+ Many different endings. Good endings, bad endings, meh endings. \n+ I'm on my fourth or fifth playthrough which is entirely different from my first one. It is exciting to see the effect of all your choices and how they influence the story. This time around is almost completely different from the first playthrough.\n+ Wonderful visual style, especially in the journal and epilogue. \n+ In the menu you can see all CGs, endings, objects, achievements, everything you have unlocked.  \n\n- This game suffers from cluncky dialogue sometimes. Which manifests itself in some sentences with horrendous grammar or an obsession with words like shoulder. \n- This game's story/dialogue needs some serious editing. There are parts where the story progresses soooo slowly. Mostly the parts with the inner dialogue and mostly concerning Rebecca or Isabella. \n- Sometimes inner dialogue/thoughts get interrupted by spoken dialogue. The inner dialogue then carries on from the point before, which sometimes makes it very easy to lose that train of thought. Same with references like 'the former' and 'the latter', referring to things said/thought ages ago. \n- There are some bits of voice acting missing from chapter 5 onwards (though I believe they are trying to fix this). \n\nOverall I can only applaud this great visual style and mostly compelling story. With their next game they should probably hire a native English speaker to check their dialogue and they should probably hire an editor to weed out the tedious bits.

Buy it.\nDo you like long and branching stories? Buy it.\nDo you like \"horror\"? Buy it.\nDo you want high production value with full voices and animated sprites? Buy It.\n\nThe Letter is - quite simply - amazeballs. At least, I think so. Some notes about my experiences with the game thus far (I've finished it 3 times, and have plans for a couple more as I barely have 60% of the achievements) to follow:\n\n1. From a gameplay standpoint, it's relatively basic VN-type stuff.  Dialogue in a box at the bottom of the screen, you read it, and move on to the next. All of the characters (including you) are fully voiced, with the exception of internal monologues and thoughts. Also, the sprites are animated and quite pretty to look at. Where I feel The Letter sets itself apart is the branching storylines.\n\nTo begin, you play 7 different chapters, each from a different character's perspective. Your choices in dialogue (and [spoiler]whether they live or die[/spoiler])carries over from one to the next, so a simple choice in Chapter 1 can have far reaching repercussions all the way in Chapter 7. I both love this, and it drives me insane. If you are a completionist, this one may take awhile - especially without a guide. [spoiler]My first playthrough, I had one person in a coma, one die, and the rest live. Then I tried one where everyone lives, and one where everyone dies. Somehow, I managed to screw up that last one and one person still lived. Some are much easier to kill than others![/spoiler] There's also a relationship system, where dialogue choices increase or decrease their ties to one another. This can mostly affect the Epilogues and the endings individuals and pairs receive.\n\n2. The story itself. While the \"horror\" elements are relatively soft, there is a solid \"creepy\" vibe to much of the game.  There are a few mild jumpscares, but nothing too intense. In fact, I think the strongest of these is actually [spoiler]the first time you click new game from the menu[/spoiler]. Other than that, the ghost's image and sound design are spot on. My only real complaint is that there are times when the story feels like it stalls out a little with an over-lengthy internal struggle. CGs are well placed and are more interactive.\n\n3. QTEs. While I understand the desire to add \"gameplay\" to a VN, these feel unnecessary and at times, frustrating to me.  Thankfully, you are able to skip them (though you'll miss out on a few achievements). There are also settings to make them easy ([spoiler]though the number mashing one in the elevator with Ash is still annoying[/spoiler]).\n\nI'm sure there's more, but that's all I can think of as I hastily type this out. I simply wanted to make sure I gave my thumbs up review for the game. I've spent almost 40 hours in this VN and I'm sure I have at least 10 more to go.

Sorry, Just channeling my fave character in this VN - Luke Wright.\n\nThis is only my second review out of my 200+ steam library but I felt I needed to praise this game where it deserves it and also clear up a few misunderstandings.\n\nIs this game horror? The overall story is that of 7 people trying to escape a curse, so in terms of story, yes. Note: although the QTE and horror images are well done, they are somewhat few and far between. You will NOT be getting jump scares every few minutes. So if you're a player who just wants action and gore All the Time you will be disappointed.\n\nNotice I said gore \"All the Time\" some of the deaths of the characters of which I will not spoil are rather gory indeed!\n\nAside from character dialogue, the rest of the narrative is devoted to descriptions - of the environment - of the characters - especially the characters. The character description concentrates on things like character x flicks her hair to the side, an action seldom seen but under these circumstances character y can't help thinking there's something wrong (this is why I don't write VNs haha).\n\nYes it can be verbose (wordy) at times. Personally I loved it, especially the sometimes coy sometimes aggressive little nuances between the main characters. Again if you came for the horror and not to read a visual novel you will be disappointed.\n\nStrengths:\nArtwork was excellent and some amazing CGs.\nFor the collectors among us plenty of replayability value to get all the epilogues and achievements.\nMusic - some truly beautiful tunes and ones that match the scenes. I play the piano and wish they could release a music score.\n\nVoice acting:\nI notice in the game description that this is only \"optional\". Well I would highly recommend the game with it on. It is incredible. Rather than actors reading lines which the player is perfectly capable reading, the VA in the Letter ADDS to the characters and the game so much that I would always wait until the VA had finished speaking before clicking on. So with that in mind:\n\nLength:\nIt took me 26 hours to run through the game once. It has so many branching paths that replaying the game is a must. So the rest of my play time has been spent replaying and trying to unlock all the achievements and endings.\n\nCan't wait until the next patch as a couple of epilogue endings are currently (04/04/2017) bugged.\n\nRoom for improvement:\nWhile the epilogue pictures are fine, the characters in them seemed a little too different visually from the game.

In cases of severe disagreement please refrain from flaming, instead downvote this review and state your own opinion in the comments, thank you very much.\n\n[h1]Where I came from[/h1]\nI read a few other VNs, including the Danganronpa and the Nonary Games series, which I enjoyed very much.\nRegarding the horror genre I read some stories by Poe and Lovecraft, some of the finest wordsmiths of their respective time and watched a bunch of different horror movies.\nOh and don't get me wrong, I'm not loving said VN's for their gameplay elements but for their intricate story.\n\n[h1]Where I went[/h1]\nAt first I was very intrigued, wondering how the story around the seven protagonists will evolve.\nDriven by the urge to find out more about the otherworldly presence haunting each and every one of the vastly different characters I read hour after hour growing more excited by the minute.\nIt had me on the edge of my seat many times, building up the tension, increasing the psychological terror and then releasing it by the appearance of the ghost, masterfully presented in stunning CGs, freeezing the blood in my veins.\n\nThis tense atmosphere persisted for many hours, but somewhere along the way, about halfway through the story it began to loosen the tight grip in which it entangled me thus far.\nThe dialogues grew tedious, the looming horror started to lose its thrill, the occasional jump scare still managed to make my heart skip a beat, but they felt more and more familiar, to similar to their predecessors.\n\nBut I kept reading, still fascinated by the glorious presentation, which is, like many others stated, the best I've seen in a VN to this day. \nGraphically stunning, musically beguiling, this VN begged for my attention, this masterfully crafted piece of art.\nI was longing for the next CG, the beautiful gore I was rewarded with for letting one of my precious characters die, wondering what sublime visual pleasures will await me at the end of this story.\n\nAnd then it occured to me, this wasn't a novel to me anymore, it was just a glorified art gallery, a quite magnificient one without doubt, but the story lost me some time ago. \nI started to bargain, as one inevitably does experiencing grief, this story could still be saved, this journey is not over yet, the different endings will justify the arduous journey.\n\nThe journey through repeating scenes viewed from the perspective of different characters, showing but the tiniest nuance of variety. \nThrough mind-bogglingly boring inner monologues. \nThrough dialogues unparalleled in mundanity.\n\nSo I arrived at the end, with a tiny part of me still hoping that this is the moment to turn this whole thing around, to bring the story back to life, to reward my endurance. \nThat, the first array of endings I encountered, did not, as failed the second to do.\nBut there was still a glimmer of hope, the true ending. \nWould it be able to finally quench my thirst for closure? Would it in fact prove to be a silver lining? \nHope.\nHope turned into despair.\n\n[h1]Where I ended up[/h1]\nI expected this VN to have similar depth to Danganronpa or the Nonary Games, but I was deeply disappointed.\nMaybe I was wrong to anticipate such complex storytelling from a work of fiction inspired by classic horror films, maybe this just isn't the right VN for me, but nonetheless I was so underwhelmed by this game, that I just had to share my experience with you. I hope (here I am, hoping again) my opinion is valued by some of you.\n\n[h1]tl;dr:[/h1]\nTop notch presentation of an overall unsatisfying piece of fiction.", "timestamp_created": 1504488659, "timestamp_updated": 1504529940, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540250", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34718524": {"recommendationid": "34718524", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997034172", "num_games_owned": 368, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504462956}, "language": "english", "review": "Really enjoyed this game.

The story is quite interesting, if a bit slow in the beginning. The characters are likeable, some more than others, but I didn't outright hate anyone. I've only played one ending, which I was aiming for cause I'm a sucker for happy ending, but I will definitely replay for the other possible endings (though it will kill me on the inside knowing what I do about certain characters and such). The game is actually quite long on a first run, and I'm sure it can be longer after many plays.\n\nAs for horror, I'll admit it wasn't very scary. I'm not sure if that was due to me being use to common horror tropes, so I'm desensitized by it or just because I was expecting it. The \"ghost\" reminds me of a generic horror character from \"The Grudge\" or even \"The Ring\" and could have been more unique. The QTE aren't hard and it's nice you can skip them if you want. If you're looking for something super scary and don't scare easily, you won't find it here. This is good for those who don't particularly like horror or get scared easily.\n\nOverall I'd give the game a 8/10, possibly higher depending on the later plays I make of the game. I do want to see more information on the curse and such. Also hopefully more development for characters. This game is worth the price to me.\n\nEdited: I forgot to talk about the voice acting and art style so I'll mention it here. Also I've played a few more endings so I'll just talk about how I feel now that I've played more.\n\nThe VAs are generally good. They're responses to certain situations fit well with the intended emotion. I've seen some people comment on how certain accents didn't fit with what they knew, and I have to agree. I honestly thought a majority of them, aside from Isabella, Ash, and Zack, to be British. That, appearntly, is not the case for some. Still the voice acting was very well done and I liked having a voice to put with the characters' faces.\n\nThe CGs and end cards are nicely done. The end cards gave me a Dragon Age Inquisition feel to them. I have to say that I wasn't too fond of the character sprites. They could have had more body variety for them. There was also a weird sort of disconnect between the sprites, the CGs and the picture form (not sure what to call the images that pop up when someone is talking but not in front of the character?). I guess it was due to the varying art styles. The 3Dish movement of the sprites was a nice bonus though. In general the art is very nice and there are plenty of CGs throughout the chapters.\n\nI've played a few different ends, as well as the true end, and I have to say it was great. I felt very conflicted over my choices on my other plays as I knew what would happen. Yet I think that's what makes it fun. You get to see the different outcomes of your choices, for better or worse. Every little decision matters and changes things even slightly.\n\nMy final score for the game is a 9/10. It's a very immersive game with well done voice acting and drawings. I can tell a lot of time and effort was put into it.", "timestamp_created": 1504323426, "timestamp_updated": 1504795105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531250", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34663177": {"recommendationid": "34663177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002571868", "num_games_owned": 438, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503748312}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic horror VN with a lot of detail put into it.

I came into this game with a limited experience of visual novels, but I found it easy to navigate and simple to understand the basics. It's a great starting point if you are new to the format.\n\nThe story itself, while not a huge deviation from traditional horror stories, is compelling, well-paced and provides a high level of interactivity with the branching outcomes available from the decisions made by the player. While not a scare-a-minute thriller, the game is undeniably creepy when it wants to be, and as you are drawn further into the story the game does a great job at creating a sort of ambient eerieness that gives you a feeling of unease. The endings provide closure and range from poignant (one way or another), to darkly comedic, to just plain dark, depending on your choices.\n\nI feel that particular praise should go towards the voice acting and art design, both of which make the novel feel immersive and relatable. The voices are clear and unique, and the VAs do a remarkable job of projecting the right emotions into their characters in different situations. The characters themselves are relatable, given distinct personalities and provide moments of horror, shock and occasional humour which blend realistically with the progress of the story.\n\nThe backgrounds are vivid and full of colour where required, and appropriately creepy at other times. The animations are well done, ranging from smooth and vivid during lighter moments to uncanny at tense ones; the transition between the two really helps to build the atmosphere. There always seems to be something moving on the screen, which helps to make things tense and also adds a level of realism. The background music is appropriately upbeat or tense, and the handful of songs with vocals are a nice touch as well. Overall, the art and sound package significantly adds to the immersion of the narrative and the experience as a whole.\n\nThe interface is easy to comprehend and generally polished. There are a few minor mistakes in how some sentences are parsed, and incorrect tense used for some words (loss/lost, worse/worst), as well as a couple of cases (only two or three out of thousands, to be fair) where the incorrect voice line is played over the text, but these are negligible technical issues and don't significantly detract from the overall experience.\n\nThe game has a high replayability factor; since my initial blind playthrough I've been going back and choosing different outcomes to see the alternate endings (including the \"True Ending\"), and it's good fun to try and unlock all the game's many achievements in the process.\n\nOverall, the game is excellent - I would highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in the horror genre or visual novels in general. It's clear that the team behind this game have crafted it with care and passion for the genre. I had a lot of fun playing it through and look forward to seeing more from Yangyang Mobile in the future.

"english", "review": "DISCLAIMER: This review is just my first impressions of the game after beating it once and messing around with a few other pathways. I understand there are many, many different ways to \u201cend\u201d the game, but I do think that my critique is still valid. If anything, I really want Yangyang Mobile to succeed and go on to make more amazing games just like The Letter, because honestly, the world could use more quality western visual novels like this, and I believe that Yangyang Mobile has the potential to create great works.\n\n[b]!!!ALSO THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS OMG!!![/b]\n\n\nOkay, so I\u2019m going to start with what I liked~\n\nFor starters, the artwork is just...[i]breathtaking.[/i] The backgrounds are great, the scenes are great, the characters and animations are great--and while I wasn\u2019t a fan of the whole \u201csemi-realistic anime\u201d style of the characters at first, it started to grow on me the longer I played--though I still prefer the more \"cartoony\" style of the intro and epilogue and sorta wish they would have gone with that instead.\n\nThe music, while nothing memorable, is pretty good and does its job. There was one song that played during Luke\u2019s chapter that I really liked (during the chat with the maid and during the ballroom scene) and I\u2019d download it if I could. The writing is top-notch. The voice acting is more hit than miss, and I do think they did a pretty good job considering it\u2019s an indie game. And finally, the branching tree system is one of the most innovative I've seen in any game to date, and little choices really do matter, which is a lot more than can be said for other games who have promised as much.\n\n\nThat being said, I\u2019m going to talk about what needs improvement.\n\nFirst off, the story\u2026\n\nI'm going to be honest--during my first playthrough of The Letter I was bored out of my skull for roughly 80% of the story. It felt like a needlessly long slice of life anime with one overly pleasant interaction after another, only occasionally being interrupted by something creepy that made me go, \"Oh, yeah. This is a horror game...\" The only thing that kept me playing was the overwhelmingly positive Steam reviews, and my desire to figure out what the heck I was missing that everyone else wasn\u2019t, otherwise I would have quit somewhere around Zachary\u2019s chapter.\n\nSo why the thumbs up? Well, I later found out that I had somehow managed to pull off the \u201cgood ending\u201d path where everyone lives on my first try, save for Hannah who died in the house fire (I screwed up on her chapter and she ended up possessed).\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until my second playthrough that I was able to fully appreciate the amazingly intricate design of the branching tree system and how small decisions greatly shape future chapters, sometimes for better or worse. I remember reading in the game description that my choices determines who lives and who dies, but I never expected one little deviation in my choices during Isabella\u2019s story would result in her getting [b][i]brutally murdered[/i][/b] at the end of her own chapter!\n\nSuddenly, everything had changed, and the story became A LOT more engaging. THIS is the kind of dread and horror I had been expecting to see when I first started the game. It\u2019s almost unfortunate though, that the path to the \u201cbad ending\u201d is a lot more entertaining than the one we should be aiming for.\n\n\nAnyway, a few more minor complaints include:\n\nMore showing, less telling. I don\u2019t need to know details like \u201cshe gave me a disapproving look\u201d when I can clearly see it on her face. It felt like the descriptive text was constantly throwing off the pacing of the conversations.\n\nAnd speaking of pacing, it was pretty jarring and tedious to replay the same two weeks [i]seven different times[/i]. I don\u2019t need to see the same scene play out from multiple different perspectives when none of them really add anything significant. It might have been better to play through the weeks while jumping between multiple characters based on what\u2019s most relevant at that point in time. Or maybe we could just have one character to follow for the whole story (I vote Ash).\n\nZachary, Marianne, and Rebecca's chapters feel unnecessary and more like padding. They\u2019d almost work better as side characters than as playable characters.\n\nSome character interactions feel forced for the sake of relationship points, and the dialogue isn\u2019t the most engaging. It would have been nice to have a choice on who we want to get close to instead of having to play through every single scenario with every single character combination.\n\n\nDespite my complaints, I still think The Letter is worth checking out. It's deinitely a labor of love, and Yangyang Mobile deserves way more attention and support. :)", "timestamp_created": 1503536471, "timestamp_updated": 1503580692, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488999", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34431999": {"recommendationid": "34431999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284954896", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510117256}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u770b\u7684\u8c1c\u53d4\u5b9e\u51b5\uff0c\u7b49\u4e0d\u53ca\u4e86\u6240\u4ee5\u81ea\u5df1\u4e70\u6765\u73a9~\n\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5168\u7a0b\u6709\u914d\u97f3\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6211\u4e2a\u82f1\u8bed\u4e09\u7ea7\u7684\u4e5f\u52c9\u5f3a\u80fd\u770b\u61c2\u3002\n\u6e38\u620f\u4e0d\u96be\u901a\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u6536\u96c6\u8981\u7d20\u5b9e\u5728\u662f\u592a\u7e41\u7410\u4e86\uff0c\u6bd5\u7adf\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ae0\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f71\u54cd\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u7ae0\u2026\u2026\n\u800c\u4e0e\u4e4b\u76f8\u5bf9\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u592a\u5c11\uff0c\u4e00\u5927\u5806\u8282\u70b9\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u9760\u7a77\u4e3e\u6cd5\u628a\u6240\u6709\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u8bd5\u4e00\u904d\u3002\n\u5bf9\u65e0\u6cd5\u63a5\u53d7\u81f4\u90c1\u7cfb\u7684\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6210\u5c31\u63a7\u7684\u4e0d\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1503472881, "timestamp_updated": 1503472881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647534", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34425802": {"recommendationid": "34425802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043818592", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503273415}, "language": "english", "review": "Returned it after 90mins of play.\n\nThe story was very slow and not engaging enough to cover up the overwinded writing and the strange 2D/3D Barbie dream maker character animation.", "timestamp_created": 1503442848, "timestamp_updated": 1503442848, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.410920", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34421404": {"recommendationid": "34421404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085944029", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509723148}, "language": "russian", "review": "This game is adorable.

The dialogue is interesting and kept me entertained the whole way through. One thing that I didn't like was how much padding there was. If the characters were talking about not telling a specific character something, there were about 15 other lines detailing that same exact thing. The game is humorous and yet horrifying, with the quick time events often being unexpected and shocking you, and if you AREN'T ready, death is the result. No worries though! Dying in a QTE doesn't force you back to a previous save, and lets you retry as many times as you'd like. The option to turn them off is there though! If QTEs aren't your cup of tea, they can be skipped using TAB, or turned off entirely in the settings panel at the bottom right corner of the screen. You can play as 7 different characters, all with intertwined stories. The choices you make in one route will TOTALLY influence everything else that happens.

I'm not a huge fan of VNs in general either. To tell the truth I was kinda forced to play 'The Letter' by a friend of mine who played it first but boy oh boy...\n\nThe animated backgrounds as well as the sprites are well done to say the least. It's not hard to see that there's been a lot of effort put into making this game. I have no complaints about the voice acting either - I didn't even expect the game to have it. The animated intro is a cool addition too. It's almost like people have enjoyed making this game. I was positively surprised with the quality and the writing of the game.\n\nI'm quite happy with the writing for about 65-75% of the game. I find the last two chapters, or at least certain parts of them, questionable. While I understand that some aspects were made this way (possibly) for a dramatic effect or due to a heightened emotional level, I fail to see a justification for a few of them.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. [spoiler] Rebecca's death - jumper - why would our cuddly wraith simply wait for Becca to finish phoning Ash and have their past from the 5th grade up discussed? I mean.. was she sipping on a cuppa while waiting on Becca or something? [/spoiler]\n2. [spoiler] Ash's death - bolt through the chest - where did it come from? It's a bit too much out of the blue for me.[/spoiler]\n3. [spoiler] When everybody's alive and Ashton infiltrates the mansion, he's overpowered by our beloved German butler, Isabella arrives first and then you have this love scene and a confession (if you played your cards right that is). I understand that I'm being quite nitpicky however I cannot let this one go. I mean the whole group moved in to assist Ash but Isabella (somehow) was first to reach him and make out with Ash right in front of passed out German who's handcuffed to a bed frame. Personally it's a bit of a stretch even though I found it rather hilarious. [/spoiler]\n\nQuick, biased and very personal character overview:\n[h1] Isabella: [/h1]\nNice character, positive and easy going. Her reactions to the predicament and issues she faces seem quite natural. The only problem I have with her is how she copes with [spoiler] the death of her father as well as being haunted[/spoiler]. After all that she should be rather shaken, right? And yet she can be positive and keep on cracking jokes.\n[h1] Hannah: [/h1]\nHated her guts at first but in the end I grew to like her. I was strongly pushing for [i] my happy ending [/i] and I was quite satisfied with the turn out. High five to developers for her personality and choices offered in her path! [spoiler] offering a cuppa to a whipping stranger in the cellar was absolutely brilliant - I still laugh every now and again [/spoiler]\n[h1] Zachary: [/h1]\nA people-pleaser. Positive to the bone, a big walking cuddly teddy bear. Hard not to like him.\n[h1] Marianne: [/h1]\nLovely Irish accent. A huge brownie point for the voice actress. I loved her character as a whole. [spoiler] Especially the drinking and drunk karaoke sessions. And there's this nice CG with Luke too. Mint is alright. [/spoiler]\n[h1] Rebecca: [/h1]\nHas 99 problems... Ashton is all of them.\n[h1] Ashton: [/h1]\nPortrayed well enough as a man of reason. Stays in character throughout the story. I would love to see what would have happened with him had he encountered [spoiler] miss cuddles [/spoiler] before everybody else. The one big issue I have with Ash is the fact that he has a [spoiler] damn firearm [/spoiler] and yet doesn't use it at all with an exception of [spoiler] shooting Luke if the player chooses to do so[/spoiler].\n[h1] Luke: [/h1]\nI absolutely love him. Best character by far! Well maybe Johannes can compete with him a little but they are most effective as a duo anyway! - the bromance is 10/10. I cannot praise the voice acting as well as the writing enough - I'm beyond satisfied with Mr Luke.\n\nThe game is massive and considering its size as well as the possible paths one can choose to go through I'm happy to overlook the issues listed above. I highly recommend 'The Letter' to people who enjoy VNs or are VN-curious and would like to start with something -  'The Letter' is that something.\n\nThe content is definitely worth the price this game is listed at.

The art and writing aspects can be improved, the most important aspect being that it needs more editing. It could be more concise and cut down. With that said, the technical flaws can be looked over; I was able to greatly enjoy the game because of the effort and care visibly put into it. There are QTEs, there's animation, and the team even bothered to add a tree branch map for players to look at. The branches get so complex, I can't imagine how long it must've taken to work out the routes. It really does feel like your choices affect the story! The game took me 26 hours to complete one route, I hadn't even expected it to go that long! There are lots of variant endings, so replayability value is high. Considering that and the amount of hours, it's /absolutely/ worth the $20.\n\nI also want to add that there's a lot of love put into the characters and relationships. It can be argued, \"This is a horror game and it's taking too long to get to the horror, the drama has no place here,\" but I personally see it as drama/horror than just solely horror. I like character-focused stories, so perhaps this aspect is biased coming from me. I can only say if you like horror and drama, then this is definitely a game to enjoy for you! If you want constant horror and no gradual buildup of relationships, try another game.\n\nI sincerely look forward to more games from Yangyang Mobile.

DID WE PLAY THE SAME GAME ?\n\nFirst: \nThe voice acting is cool. Like really nice, the voices really match the characters.\nThe drawings are nice too when it's about places and objects BUT the characters look really bad sometimes.\nThey are animated like they were floating or something and they have such weird proportion (especialy Zack the taller of them all who look like he has been compress to enter the screen when you talk to him.)\nThe chara design is... inexistant. I mean The characters have faces but their cloth are so simple or weird  (what the fuck is Ashton supposed to look like ? Not a 30 years old man I can assure you.)\nHannah just have a white dress and big boobs. Yep that's her design. Well... okay.\nThere is some fan service in the game clearly and when females characters move or talk their boobs wiggle, always. \n\nThe writting:\nSo the writting is not awfull but it has a lot of weird things. The first one is the rhythm. Sometime the story is really slow like NOTHING HAPPEN because the character is just here, thinking about his childhood to give you ALL his back story or giving you every details of what he is thinking or doing at the second.\nSometimes it just feel like they needed to make the game longer or something. So we have a scene where 3 people talk about the house they just buy and what they are gonna do with it...AND IT LAST ALMOST AN HOUR ! One pointless hour where they decide if they want a garage or a nice room and WHO CARES ? Excuse me for some reason I though this was an horror visual novel, not \"talking about a rich dream house simulator\".\nBut the worst of all in the writting is that the characters think of a lot of things, everytime. You would say that it's normal and I agree, I think it's important to really be in the head of a character but before I tell you the rest of my thoughts I'm gonna tell you that I'm trying to reach my bottle of water. \nIt's a big bottle of water, name \"Mont something\". I like this one better because of the taste ! It's so...I don't know, lighter compare to other water ! Other water make my tummy hurt you know and I love to drink water you see. It's just near me but my desk is so filled with things that it make it not easy to reach. On my desk there are so many memories of my childhood. It remember me that when I was young MY PARENTS DIED.\n\nI swear I'm not jocking, when you see the character \"thoughts\" it looks like that. A lot of pointless details that lead to one \"memory\" supposed to help you feel closer to the character but everything is throw at your face.\nYou thought it was boring when I was describing why I like my water ? Well now imagine I'm in the middle of a dialogue. I just spoke to someone but before you can read what the other person is telling me you have to read ALL my thoughts of my water again.\nAnd that is exactly what happen in the game.\nALL.\nTHE.\nTIME.\nA character will tell a joke and then you will be lost in his head for 5 minutes of him thinking why it is a good joke, since when did he know the personn he is talking to, what would he do without this person and stuff, and stuff, and stuff, AND STUFF and THEN the other character will laugh at the joke.\nSometime It took so many time just to have the respons of the other character that I forgot what my character said in the \nfirst place !\nYou can't stay focus on the dialogue because they are often cut like that. In a normal story the characters would just speak to eath other, tell all they have to and THEN the main character would be lost in thought or he can cut when it's something REALLY important but well not here.\n\nThe characters:\nAnd maybe you would ask: \"so if the characters think that much it's mean they are very interesting and have a lot to say and are well developp !\" Well... it's really weird.\nThe characters are supposed to be 30 years old. They are not supposed to be teenagers but i'm sorry they are all written like teenagers and that was so odd. \nIt's really hard for me to explain but they all have jobs, homes, \"money\". Yet they are all single exept for the couple of rich and they just do joke at eatch other and when one of them is scared as shit they...Laught and tease that person.\nWOW such adult reactions really \"ahahah you're so scared you just scream on us, you hit your head too hard, common ghost ?! Be serious.\"\nAnd when this character tried to talk about how affraid she is with her best friend... her best friend told her that she don't care and just want silence.\nBEST.\nBEST.\nFRIEND.\nEVER !!!\nOf course nobody would belive ghost stories like that but I'm sorry If I see my best friend crying and acting really weird telling me she saw a ghost I will be really scared for her, because even if I don't belive in ghost, I belive her so I would check if it can reassure her, I would offer to stay with her, I don't know DO SOMETHING NOT TEASING AND ASK SILENCE !\n\nAnd one last thing. Luke the rich character, is presented in the game as a racist, sexist morron. So normaly you don't really like him and think he will die... well when you arrive to his chapter everything is made so you \"attach\" to him. \nAnd well no. I'm sorry I don't care if he is nice with his wife and goddaugter or that he had a terrible chlidhood (all the characters in this novel have so it's not special anymore).\nSomeone who just say \"what is that neggro doing here ?\" is NOT likeable and should NOT be ! At least if his wife was outraged at him but NO. The wife is very found of a black character which she befriend really quick but when her husband say the N world just in front of her she just don't care. She just try to calm him but nobody tell him to shut up. And that was very painfull.\nBeing racist is NOT okay, it's NOT something that every character can be like a detail. And when you tell a story, the way you treat racist, sexist or oppresive characters matter ! It kinda express how you seem them and well in this story it's really nothing more that just a little detail just here to shake things a little and it's really not a good way touse it at all.\n\nThe horror:\nAnd what about the ghost ? Well when I first saw her I LOVED HER ! Really it was so awesome ! She really look scary ! Sure she look a lot like the one from The Ring but it's okay as long as they do different thing later in the game it will work !\nWell too bad, the gost is nothing more that the one from the ring. I don't care if the ghost look like  one from another movie but if you don't do a single thing to make it different THEN IT'S JUST COPYING SORRY.\nSo many time a character was somewhere and I was praying \"something is gonna happen ! Ghost show yourself !\" But NOPE, nothing happen. It was just like using your fishing pole on a tree in pokemon red.\nit's not a HORROR visual novel it's a visual novel with a ghost and trust me it's different.\nSometime you will see the ghost and that's cool but HALF of the \"horror\" in that novel are just nightmares character's do... \nWow.\nSuch originality.\nVery scary\nMuch \"aaahhh\"\nSo I think I will stop here.

Only reading the updates was already worth the money and seeing them making their baby professional an unbelievably cool experience, so I cannot exclude being a little bit biased. \n\nWhen I started with this novel, I was absolutely tired from VNs and planned to stop reading them altogether. I just couldn't take the clich\u00e9s anymore and felt like the target audience was limited on teenagers, which is just not the kind of stuff I enjoy anymore. What I expected of this novel was a short little horror experience with its fair share of jumpscares and some amateurish story to let things move forward. What it delivered, however, was pretty much the opposite in every regard.\n\nAlthough it is being advertised as a horror experience, the heart of the novel actually lies in its characters and \"drama aspects\", for the lack of a better term. While the cast seems pretty uninteresting at first glance, your opinion of almost any character will probably change once you get to their chapter. I was a bit sceptical if this \"Every chapter is from a different perspective\" concept would work, but it turned out to be exactly what the novel needed to emphasize its strengths. Every perspective provides a very unique experience: All characters have different ways of thinking and therefore leading the narrative (some are very ego-centered, some can read people like books and act accordingly, etc.). Even if you hate characters first, you usually grow with their chapter for that reason. Additionally, they all have some kind of personal conflict to deal with, leading to each chapter adding to the excitement instead of just driving things forward. Apart from one chapter, I actually was never bored with this novel, which is not often the case. And mostly, the characters get more and more interesting with time, especially Luke is ridiculously well-written and constantly surprises until the very end. \n\nSince the characters are all in their mid twenties and working, the topics also tend to be about more adult themes, which is a refreshing experience after the 100th \"High school boy gets into something with 8 girls wanting his d...direct attention\". Be aware though that it tends to get very dark, as expected from the horror genre I guess. Without spoilering too much, it will be about topics like rejection, self-hatred, not being able to move in any direction with your life, what to do in a relationship that seems to fall apart after many years, and so on. If you are into these kind of dark topics and maybe enjoyed works like Saya no Uta, you are definitely in for a treat. The writing turned out to be surprisingly profound surrounding these and can be quite intense if you have any personal experience with any topic.  \n  \nAnother big plus is the level of detail: The devs really did not shy away from anything to make the VN as lively as possible and took quite some risks in doing so. If there's anything in the background that can move, it will. Sprites of the characters actively breath and move around, even smartphones will actively show the call-time. Not to mention this VN is fully voiced in English with lip synchronization. The voice acting is also really top-notch most of the time, although I felt like some actors didn't really find the right tone for more silent scenes and tend to overact a bit. In the first prototype, these attempts seemed to backfire a bit and put it into an uncanny valley direction, but they stuck to their idea and made so many improvements that this feeling is completely gone. This is probably the most lively novel I've seen so far (yes, even with a ghost - oh, the irony). \n\nOn the down-side, the writing was left alone a little bit too much. At the current stage, it's a little bit \"from foreigners for foreigners\" you could say. If English is not your native language, chances are you will not have too many issues with it and just notice some mistakes here and there. English natives seem to have a lot more issues with it, though. The devs are focusing on improving the narrative now to correct that, but apparently this also includes voiced lines to an extend, so there will be a limit. That does not mean the writing in itself is bad, though, it's just about grammar mostly. \n\nAdditionally, the main story is a little bit lacking. The first endings you reach will probably be a big disappointment, and reaching other endings can at times be a bit tedious because the skipping takes a while and sometimes considered already-known texts to be new because they have some few additional lines. There is a True Ending, however, that adds a lot to lead it to a nice \"Make your own theories\" direction and gives a more satisfying feeling. However, it's absolutely not a mind-blowing experience in any way and the main story makes very slow progress. So if you only want that out of a novel, this is not the one for you. \n\nAnd ironically, I personally found the horror to be the worst aspect. It's a typical \"ghost girl\" thing with all the typical scenes you can imagine and already know from movies. Most of the time, the scenes are rather short and rely on jump scares. There's no big buildup for a general creepy atmosphere or anything similar. I'm personally only really scared if horror is done in a Silent Hill like way - playing with the unknown basically and making you uncomfortable with disharmonic music and art. It just didn't work at all for me.\n\ntl;dr / verdict: This is for you if you enjoy psychological dramas in a darker direction, but not if you are looking for the next mind-blowing mystery. Apart from a whole lot of grammar mistakes, the quality is top-notch and even a shining example for novels to come. Not only does it not have to hide from professional works, it even outdoes most. It might not be the perfect novel that will stick in your head for years due to lacking an excellent overarching plot, but Yangyang Mobile have shown that they certainly have the talent to do great VNs for an adult audience.", "timestamp_created": 1502827927, "timestamp_updated": 1503791194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705243", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34260777": {"recommendationid": "34260777", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978049429", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 2652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502786575}, "language": "english", "review": "For the price, this is definitely a great VN and a steal.

Of course, much of this horror manifests in the form of an omnipotent and totally evil haggard ghost girl who loves taunting, terrorizing, and on occasion, murdering those with any sort of connection to the mansion.\n\nThe game shifts between its cast of seven people in a specific order, all of whom are given a lot of character depth over time, to the point that I was rooting for all of them to make it out alive. (Something I succeeded in doing on my second playthrough.) The voice acting in particular is excellent. I honestly believe that it has set the standard to which English visual novels should aspire too.\n\nThat said, I also have my fair share of gripes. The biggest ones being the litany of grammatical errors and a few unvoiced lines that pop up as the game goes on. It's a damn shame to see how so many games release broken and unpolished upon release, and now I just have to wait on the developers to patch everything up, whenever they do.\n\nAnother major complaint I have is from the story point of view. [spoiler]Specifically, the final scene you get if you haven't done the true ending, where the ghost returns and murders Kylie. Given how the true ending is very far removed from a happy one, I find this scene to be a thorough disservice to the choices I've made as a player. Personally, I'd just like to dismiss it as an inconsequential nightmare, and I wouldn't mind if it was removed from the game entirely in a future update.[/spoiler]\n\nAll these caveats aside, The Letter is a terrific, gripping visual novel well worth your time, and if you have room in your budget, I do recommend checking it out.", "timestamp_created": 1502734104, "timestamp_updated": 1502734160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34240223": {"recommendationid": "34240223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085744382", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 3237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502842182}, "language": "english", "review": "Man, oh man, oh man. This game is long as hell and definitely worth the price they're asking just because of the insane 30-plus hours it took me to do one play-through-- and if you want to get the true ending, like me, you will have to do MANY play-throughs.\n\nSo let's do some simple positives and negatives, right?\n\nPositives:\n1. Far exceeded my expecations visually. The CGs are amazing and often have motion and beautiful music-- but not just the CGs, the characters themselves when they speak and move-- it's all very expressive and well done for an indie developer I've never heard of.\n2. Many, MANY branching narratives that have effect on later narratives-- and which ending you'll get.\n3. Voice-acting was SUPERB. Very well-acted, and you can feel the emotion without being forced into it. My goodness, I just finished the first Danganronpa game and found much of the voicework to be cringe-worthy-- but all of this in The Letter was highly appropriate (although Kylie was a little annoying from time to time), and Luke's voice was probably my favorite. His voice actor was very convincing, and I would do a little happy-dance in my seat whenever Luke came on screen because of the distinct way he reads the lines. Simply amazing.\n4. Soundtrack is also well-composed. I give props to the composer, because without him, many scenes would not have half the intensity. Especially in Luke's story, where he's picking daffodils-- and that eye-opening CG comes up-- that's some of the best music. It felt like something really big was getting revealed.\n5. Elsie Lovelock! Oh my God! I only know her because of YouTube and her incredible female cover of \"Hellfire\" (which you all should watch if you want to be emotionally wrenched into \"forbidden desire\")-- but I had no idea she'd been recruited for this and I'm glad! Sweetpoffin is extremely talented and deserves the work!\n\nNegatives:\n1. The game is too flipping long, and I mean that in the nicest way possible. Yes, the story has many interesting sections but there's also a LOT of lull, especially when the reader is forced to go back to a scene and read it from a different character's perspective-- and that's another thing!\n2. There are way too many character narratives. I was pretty much done after Zach's storyline and really had no desire to read Rebecca's-- but the completionist in me trudged on. I really was just yawning throughout most of Becca and Ash's narratives because, like I said, there are interesting points but after a while you can guess a majority of what the section offers and end up skipping or clicking very fast through it because you're waiting for something more interesting (i.e. ghost/curse stuff to show up) and that's just undeserving to the writer(s) who spent so much time on it.\n3. Probably what most people are curious about is the infamous \"n-word\" scene that makes it's appearance during a certain route in Isabella's chapter. [spoiler]*sigh* I'll tell you all right now, it's almost just inserted for shock value. A little in poor taste simply because the writers/artists don't even show Zach's reaction to the word, like he hears it all the time, (and maybe he does) but since the developers decided to use the word I expect to see some kind of response (whether it's Zach being angry or nonchalant, I really don't care). It just didn't work as well as it could have, since I believe the point was to make Luke look extremely racist.[/spoiler]\n4. Even with the latest patch, spelling and grammar are still not completely addressed. There is much to be fixed.\n5. QTEs (Quick Time Events) SUCK ASS. You ever get to the office QTE in Isabella's chapter, skip it. Not worth the headache. Same with the elevator QTE in Ash's chapter. It sucks even harder.\n6. Ash is full of shit. [spoiler]His character is firmly rooted in reason (hence about a third of the story's conflict) and suddenly gets suspicious about an \"odd woman\" who shows up at the house-warming party? If anything, because Ash is such an advocate for science and realism, he would pass her off as nothing but a weird party guest but oh no! Maybe there is a curse?! Could Isabella be right?! And it's because of Ash's insane hard-headedness that made it seem nearly impossible for him to ever believe in the curse-- which is why I believe the writers themselves realized that more than halfway into production and tried to remedy it by rushing Ash's character into belief based on one (barely) supernatural encounter that wasn't even specifically directed at him. I guess what I'm trying to say is that he's pretty dumb, and all his encounters sort of happen at once (or felt like it), whereas the other characters seem to fall prey to the ghost pretty regularly...and it just doesn't work for me.[/spoiler]\n7. Other plotholes that bothered me. [spoiler]Why is Marianne allowed to live in the dungeons but Zach is brutally murdered in his cell? It doesn't make freaking sense! Obviously Zach is bigger and would have fought hard but no, he's freaking mutilated and has his body parts dragged around to the other narratives and Marianne? Oh, me? I'm perfectly fine! The ghost had me in her clutches but let me live for mere plot convenience! Isn't that swell? I was trapped and cornered just like Zach-- so it's pretty much all bullshit when you get to that point, unless I'm missing something because I haven't found the true ending...but I hightly doubt that.[/spoiler]\n\nSo there it is. As far as I know, no one has found the true ending yet and I really want to know! The game really pulls you in and I did get obsessed, for a time. It's just...it gets old going from one narrative to another and I wish there weren't so many characters, if I'm being honest. I feel like the story could have done away with Rebecca, Ash, and McCollough's narratives and sink their important story bits into the others. It's just way too long, and I'm frustrated that I still don't know the truth about any of it! So, if you have a lot of patience and a fast finger to speed through the boring/annoying parts-- this is the perfect game for you.\n\nP.S.

I knew this VN had the potential to be great from its Kickstarter, which I duly backed. Throughout development, Yangyang Mobile ran a slick show, and I\u2019d hold it as a good example as to how a good Kickstarter is run. Does it live up to the hype?\n\nYes and no. I\u2019ll explain.\n\nFrom the outset, The Letter draws you in with a well-crafted atmosphere. Good writing and beautiful art really heighten the emotion of a given scene. I enjoyed the unique style which evokes anime though in a grittier fashion \u2013 a bit of a risk that pays of very well, helping establish the mood of the game. Overall, it hooks you with stellar character-driven drama, I was enthralled by the interaction between the protagonists and how they react to the plot driving forward.\n\nThis excellence however causes a bit of an issue. It\u2019s not really of the horror genre now. It has elements of it (certainly some scenes did a good job of getting that horror feeling!), but I thought it overall underdelivers on horror. I think this is the point from some of the negative reviews I\u2019ve read that resonates with me the most. The focus is on the character interaction. I think some people expected something a bit faster paced and in your face \u2013 and its honestly not unwarranted. Nevertheless, in this drama aspect, The Letter truly shines \u2013 but that\u2019s not what we expected. And overall, the horror aspect of a ghost cursing people is basically The Ring/Grudge \u2013 it\u2019s not exactly breaking new ground there.\n\nI was however put off by a lot of bugs and typos throughout the game. While of course that can be patched, and Yangyang have been quite good at that, it\u2019s a bit disappointing to see yet another game pushed out still a bit buggy. I\u2019d raise complaints if it was any other developer.\n\nNevertheless, I thought the VN still had plenty of strengths, and that\u2019s further bolstered by the excellent soundtrack and well produced vocal theme songs -  I can\u2019t wait for the OST DLC! And the voice acting is suprisingly great - don't lie, we all groaned a bit at 'english voice acting' -  subs not dubs! This is a great exception - the voice acting is excellent.\n\nOverall, I\u2019ve recommend waiting a few patches down the line, maybe a sale, before you pick this one up. If you can stand unvoiced lines and typos, you can go ahead and buy now.

Your choices have actual consequences unlike most games that boast choices as a feature. I have spent a considerable amount of time on this game and yet, I am still finding new interactions and scenes! \n\nAs a visual novel, the game offers a rather cliche story however, with the excellent writing, beautiful artwork and fantastic voice acting, it delivers an experience which I have not yet seen in other visual novels.\n\n\nThere are minor bugs here and there, but the development team is actively working to this day to fix them.

Instead I experienced being so annoyed I wanted to punch myself in the face. This game is full of bad writing, imbicile characters, utterly strange animations and repeating the same things over and over. And it is not scary. It's not a horror game.\n\nYou get the chance to make a decision from time to time. There is a moment in the start were you're in a car and a dialouge turns unbearable for your character. Your only decisions is to lie or change subject. What kind of person only has those two utterly stupid choices in an uncomfortable situation. Not once had I the opportunity to make a choice that I would myself. But I get that, I'm playing as this young girl - not myself. \n\nYou get information in three different forms.\n- Descriptions\n- Your own thoughts\n- Dialouge\n\nWhen a scene unfolds the information is repeated in all three phases all the time. And a lot of times its just telling you what you see. 'The walls are filled with art'. I can see that. I am looking at your graphic. It annoyed me that there constant is discriptions of what you see. Instead of using the time on good dialouge, a lot of time goes on reapting the same information in all three phases. And it just goes on and on and on witht the same topic.\n\nWhen there's a dialouge, all the characters in it is standing/floating in front of you. There are several animations of smiles, laughes and gestures. And then there is descriptions of their expressions. 'Becca looks worried'. Then you look at her animation and she stares stiff out in the air. Why didn't the developers make her look worried and skip the constant descriptive information. The scenes are full of instances where one of the characters has a reaction. Instead of a good animation, there is a small gesture and then a small text describing it. And then the reaction becomes the focus of the dialouge.\nDescription info: 'Becca looks worried'\nYour own thoughts: 'Becca always looks out for me'\nDialouge: 'Becca, I can take care of myself'\n\nConstant repeating and I felt it so exhausting.\n\nAnd example:\n[spoiler]The Wrights couple is described over and over as not being in a good mood. Instead of telling it every time. Why don't you make an animation that shows it? Or make it more clear in the dialouge. The constant shift of direct information - then thoughts - then talking, was quite annoying. And the same info is repeated over and over.[/spoiler] \n\nAfter 5 hours of playtime I had three horror encounters and they were not scary. I read gore in the game tags and the most gore I experienced is from looking at the main characters that looks like they are 14 years old. [spoiler]There is this couple who wants to buy a mansion and the 'man' looks like he just turned 5. I understand that its animated to be in the anime genre, but everyone has baby clean skin. I mean come on. The only one who didn't look like a toddler is the professor.[/spoiler]\n\n80% of the game is social encounters in which the characters develop their relationships and the plot thickens around them all. But they are so long and often just plain boring. And they are filled with dialouge that is just.... My best word for it is... stupid.\nTo give an example:\n[spoiler]You and three of the main characters go to a movie that one of the characters has made. The next day you invite two of them to dinner. You get information about the guy who made the movie, he looks dull. Then your character thinks for herself that he looks a bit down, which is unusual. Then there is information about the third character looking worried at him. And then asks him 'You look dull - what is wrong?' So again, repreting the same stuff over and over. And they use about 2 minutes to get to the point - which is bad reviews. And then your dim wit character is all like \"Omg, what reviews?' 'What are you talking about?' 'OMG - tell me!'. Apparently she is not able to make 2 +2 equal 4. After several cringeworthy bad written lines he tells her that it is reviews about the movie they saw last night. Then you can spend your time on an overdramatic scene where the two girls get upset over him considering givin up making movies.[/spoiler]\nAnother example:\n[spoiler]At the open house the Wrights are clearly interested in buying the house. The woman has several times stated that they ARE buying it. And they ask when they can move in. The next day at the office when they show up, the main character is all like. \"Omg what are they doing here? \"Are they buying?\" \"Wauw, already. So fast\" \nI mean... Come on Miss Santos... It can't be that hard to figure out. What did you expect when they showed up?[/spoiler]\n\nI kept on playing because I hoped it would get more entertaining and better. But I just ended up in endless and long scenes with only one purpose. To show the player what kind of characters you are around. And it is just repreted over and over and over and over and over and over. \n\nIf you have a fear of cup noodles, this game is NOT for you. The main character has a low budget for food and lives on cup noodles. Which they tell you atleast 10 times in the first hour you play this. \n\nCup noodles. Cup noodles. Cup noodles.\nI'm never eating cup noodles again. It will remind me of this. \n\nThe music is quite good though. Everyone seems to have an average IQ of 50 and all the girls have large breasts. 10/10 would visit that place if I get divorced.\n\nI'm giving this game a few more hours and I might change my review after.

I don't remember the exact day, but I think it was during one of her time in the school and I think the entry was placed after and event that did not happen yet that day.\n\n-near the end Luke brought up Marianne's whereabouts as if he actually knew. I'm  not sure if this was meant to imply that he did or if it was just an accident.\n\n-There may be a bug with the title screen after completing the game.

Even then, I was able to get to the Gallery, but after trying to get to the Extras, it would just take me to the Gallery.\n\nI really am sorry I could not be more specific with some of these, but I really do hope this helps.

The beautiful visuals, full English voice acting, and excellent animations made the game look really promising. However, I also saw a tag.\n\n\"Sexual Content\"\n\nHowever, it was not accompanied by the all too common \"Nudity\" tag. Those two are red flags for me. After doing my research and discovering that The Letter is, in fact, not a hentai game, I bit the bullet.\n\n41 hours of gameplay later, and I can convincingly say that not only is \"The Letter\" the best visual novel I've ever read/watched/played/experienced (whatever the correct verb is), it's also among my favourite works of fiction of all time. That includes movies, novels AND TV shows.\n\nThe Great\n*Visuals are beautiful. The CG scenes, animated sprites, backgrounds, everything is perfect.\n*Voice acting is top notch. Really, fantastic job to everyone involved in the VA.\n*Characters are deep, VERY different, and multilayered. Each have their own internal conflicts, perspectives, and personalities. The first person voice of the game really nails it.\n*Choices that matter. AND I MEAN MATTER. There are nearly 200 achievements in the game, and even after 41 hours of gameplay, I still don't have them all. I STILL HAVEN'T SEEN EVERY ENDING. And, without spoiling anything, you can get endings that range from \"feel-good\" to \"melancholic\" to \"truly horrific\".\n*The horror. As someone who is not particularly a fan of jump scares, there was never a time I felt as though the game offered cheap thrills. The real horror isn't even in these moments (although they certainly add to the tension); it's in what the experience does to the characters.\n*Music and sound. Brilliant. Not much to say other than spot on.\n*The writing. Apart from some grammar mistakes, particularly involving \"would\" and \"could\" (specifically, the absence of them where appropriate), the writing is gripping, and written in the voice of each of the characters. So strong is the writing that, even in the absence of all the other positives, this still would have made for a fantastic novel.\n*Visible branches. Ever wanted to know exactly why your decisions mattered, or where something changed? The game provides you with an entire tree which shows the paths you've taken previously, just in case you wanna try something different. Why don't more games do this?\n\nThe Less Great\n*Especially towards the latter parts of the game, there are missing audio clips, audio clips which play in the wrong place, missing words, repeated words, and other slight inconsistencies. Yangyang Mobile are working hard to correct these errors, so hopefully they'll be fixed soon!\n*You can't name your save files, or delete them for that matter. It's a minor thing, but given the amount of other conveniences they've included in the game, it really sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\nIf you're looking for a visual novel with memorable characters, legitimate scares, great dialogue, a very branching narrative, choices that matter, awesome visuals, and fantastic music, you're asking for a lot in a game...\n\nBut The Letter delivers.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1502268734, "timestamp_updated": 1502268734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.740767", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34112377": {"recommendationid": "34112377", "author": {"steamid": "76561198332682712", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511706385}, "language": "english", "review": "Well designed game with great art and storytelling.

That is all I can say without spoiling it in the overall sense. In terms of the way the scares come out, its pretty creepy and often you'll find a normal situation suddenly without music and thats when the heart rate speeds up, where is it coming from now?\nGameplay: The relationship system is very hard to handle as when you say one thing thinking youll gain positive with someone you get negative, although this adds twists to the game I dislike not being able to pick my own path. There are mini games in which you can play or skip which sometimes fustrate you but at other times add extreme tension like the completely pitch black room one with the camera... Very creepy.\nArt: The art is beautiful although the blushing potraits look as though the characters havent had sleep in three years. The CGs are quite beautiful and the backgrounds are well done.\n\nOverall I would give this a 8/10 when compared to CLANNAD or other masterpiece visual novels but when compared to English Visual novels or horror ones it would be a 10/10.

Wie in anderen Spielen dieser Art, ist es Aufgabe des Spielers, sich in die Geschichte einzuf\u00fchlen, an ihr teilzunehmen als passiver Beobachter, meistens jedenfalls. Denn es gibt einige Quick Time Events und viele, wirklich \u00fcberaus viele Entscheidungen zu treffen, welche nat\u00fcrlich der Spieler \u00fcbernimmt und die wei\u00df Gott nicht einfach und mit dem Tode eines hei\u00dfgeliebten Charakters enden k\u00f6nnen...\n\n[h1] Handlung [/h1]\nDie Handlung dreht sich um die seltsamen Geschehnisse um das Ermengarde-Herrenhaus im fiktiven St\u00e4dtchen Luxebourne. Seit jeher Ranken sie seltsamste Ger\u00fcchte \u00fcber das Anwesen und ihre letzten Bewohner, ein vor Jahrhunderten verstorbener Lord und Lady. Klingt klischeehaft? Ist es aber definitiv nicht. Die junge, ehrgeizige Isabella Santos ist im Auftrag ihrer Immobilienfirma und mit Hilfe ihrer Kollegin Rose Cooper, nun daran, diese seit so vielen Jahren verlassene Villa an neue Besitzer zu verkaufen. Jedoch findet sie bei einem Rundgang einen seltsamen Brief, der ihr Leben und dass der Leute um sie herum drastisch ver\u00e4ndern wird.\n\n[h1] Charaktere [/h1]\nDie Geschichte wird in sieben Kapiteln erz\u00e4hlt und dreht sich immer um die Tage zwischen dem 17. Oktober und 1. November. In jedem Kapitel schl\u00fcpft man in die Rolle von einer anderen einzigartigen Figur, welche alle \u00fcber die eine oder andere Weise miteinander in Verbindung stehen. Ob die abergl\u00e4ubige Immobilienmaklerin Isabella, die vornehme Mathematikerin Hannah, der gutm\u00fctige Fotograph Zachary, die ehrgeizige Architektin Marianne, die toughe Lehrerin Rebecca, der rationale Detektiv Ashton oder der exzentrische Unternehmer Luke, man lernt sie ausnahmslos alle sehr detailliert kennen und lieben. Auch die Nebencharaktere waren meiner Meinung nach sehr gut ausgearbeitet und sympathisch.\n\n[h1] Atmosph\u00e4re [/h1]\nDer Zeichenstil ist sehr h\u00fcbsch, und die Bewegungen fl\u00fcssig und sch\u00f6n anzusehen. Ein ganz besonderer Augenschmaus sind nat\u00fcrlich die gr\u00f6\u00dferen Szenen welche mit einem sehr sch\u00f6nen teilweise statischem, aber auch manchmal animierten Bild aufwarten k\u00f6nnen. Die Musik tr\u00e4gt auch viel zur Stimmung bei. Besonders gefielen mir hierbei die gesungenen Parts. Die Sprecher sind \u00fcberaus talentiert und professionell zur Sache gegangen. Ich muss dazu sagen, dass ich englischen Sprechern immer etwas skeptisch gegen\u00fcberstehe und deswegen andere Visual Novels wie CLANNAD oder Amnesia deswegen auf japanisch gespielt habe, einfach weil mir dort die Synchro wesentlich besser gefallen hat. Nicht jedoch hier, die englische Synchronisation brauch sich echt nicht zu verstecken.\n\n\nJetzt noch ein paar W\u00f6rter zu den Achievements. Es gibt hier unheimlich viele verschiedene Enden, was den Wiederspielwert ohne hin schon sehr hoch ansetzt.

I know it says it was inspired by certain Asian horror movies, but the [spoiler]long haired, pale skin Japanese ghost that makes the -same- sound[/spoiler] is really overdone. I wished they would have tried to make it stand out a bit more.  \n- The plot is not this game's strong point. Not to say that it's bad, but it certainly isn't unique or something that will blow your mind...especially if you consider the plot of many Asian horror movies. \n- The writing can drag on sometimes and feel unecessary, especially when I was playing the second last chapter. Too much introspection. \n- Last one is more of a personal gripe. I was initially reluctant to buy the game because of: (yes, it's going to sound silly) the jiggle physics. It's not only unrealistic, it made my mind unintentionally create an association with some of the garbage lewd VNs that have littered steam. That being said, it isn't too bad.

You can have the most beautiful art ever seen, the most magical musical score, the greatest CGs, a wonderful plot, but if your characters are cardboard, then none of that matters. A game depends on its characters. If you don't feel anything for the characters, (good or bad, it doesn't matter), then the rest of it doesn't matter.

From the way they speak, to their mannerisms, you can certainly tell the developers spent a lot of time developing every person in the game from a stereotype to a fully fleshed out character, which is a spectacular feat in and of itself. \nI'll stop right here, so I don't spoil anything, but, in short, is this game worth twenty dollars?\nYes, Probably even more!", "timestamp_created": 1502065680, "timestamp_updated": 1502065680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568941", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34067043": {"recommendationid": "34067043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153584434", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502204446}, "language": "english", "review": "I saw a short video from someone playing the game.

Wow. This game is absolutely phenomenal. Stellar story mixed with actual, meaningful decisions. This is something that TellTale offered, but this game actually delivers. It surpassed my wildest dreams in terms of overall content as well, as most VN will take 15 to 16 hours if you run all the routes and get a real grasp for the story. 33 hours in and I'm still finding new content to keep me occupied. I don't get bored due to the fact that each character is double-sided in nature and that you can only see this by running through all the chapters. The characters are fleshed out as well, and their VAs have done a wonderful job (except Ash's weak scream in chapter 1 when he drops his phone, it's a half-hearted scream). However, this game is not without faults. The modal verbs are usually will or I'm instead of something like would or could. You really have to play the game to see it, and it doesn't happen very much in chapter 1, but it gets frustrating to read, especially during the crucial moments. As well, near the end there are some lines without VA that just seem to be there to be there. If you skip them and match them to the next VA line, it'll still make sense though.

I loved The Letter, but now I have to sleep with a nightlight on.\n\nPros:\n-characters are diverse and have unique personalities\n-playing as all those different characters kept things fresh\n-able to greatly affect character relationships including various romance pairings\n-the variety of quicktime events (QTE or minigames) kept things fresh\n-the ability to skip the QTE that I sucked at\n-ANIMATIONS!  Okay don't get too excited, it's not really animated, but the sprites move so much more than I'm used to and felt really alive compared to other games\n-that slap sound effect\n-slow unveiling of history kept me invested in replaying for new ending variations\n-nothing is black and white\n-the creepy creepy noises\n-best english voice acting I've ever heard in an indie vn (though some accents are a bit off, the acting is spot on)\n-pathing chart makes for a handy (and mostly spoiler free) guide\n-scared me half to death!\n\nCons:\n-while always easy to understand, the writing sometimes switches to past/present incorrectly (gets worse later in game)\n-some variations were really minor and not being able to skip them got boring after a few playthroughs\n-I couldn't romantically pair a couple that I wanted to\n-I'm still not entirely sure what the hell is going on (though I've heard rumors of a potential prequel that would explain a lot YES PLEASE!)\n-I am a fully grown woman and I am now afraid of the dark!\n\nI play a ton of visual novels and this game does a lot of things that I find really innovative.  The almost animation of sprites, playing from different perspectives, watching all the pieces slowly trickle into place.  The QTE and animation add tension and occasional button mashing panic.  As much as I loved the story, it's even more impressive from a technical point of view.\n\ntl;dr-  If you like horror and ever had even a passing interest in visual novels, then I highly recommend this game.  There's more game to it than most VNs, but it's still skippable for those who just want to read.  The many virtues vastly outweigh the few flaws.

The game is full of  decisions the player can take to further the story, which immediatly reminds one of japanese horror classic \"The Ring\" - not at least because of the black haired ghost woman herself. Besides this resemblance though the story has enough novelty, and most important a good cast of characters as well as a gripping presentation and atmosphere to make you want to play it through.\nThe decisions mostly impact the relationships between the different characters, which in the end impacts the story as you play through it and finally will lead to different endings for each one, but also can lead to a quick and bloody ending sometimes. This also can happen through some Quick Time Events, which are thankfully optional to play through.\n\nThe characters are well enough defined and each of them is presented during their representative playthrough. Regarding the Presentation one can only say that the backgrounds are nicely drawn as are the different faces and poses of the characters, which helps transporting their moods, beside the well done voice actors, who are doing a good job bringing their alter egos to live. The atmospheric music rounds up an good impression and is especially during horror scenes very fitting (together with the grisly done ghost appearances).\n\nRounding this up \"The Letter\" has quite some achievements to get, the decisions really influence the game somewhat so more than one playthrough won\u00b4t get boring. With around 15 to 20 hours for the intial playthrough you get your moneys worth here for sure. Technically the game is well done too.. despite some missing audio at a few speeches and a few typos here and there.\n\nConclusio: I am someone who get\u00b4s bored easily, but the Letter had me gripped enough to make me invest quite some hours into it to get my first endings.. not exactly those i was aiming for either, but the characters are rich enough that initial likes or dislikes even change during the game. Also i very much enjoyed the thrill this game could provide, together with the voice actors, who really fit their characters (i especially liked the Police Chief/ Bartender speaker ;) ).  So all in all i can really recommend The Letter to players who like a good VN or also Telltale Games.. or just a good ghost story.\n\nPoint Scale: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1501961470, "timestamp_updated": 1511430675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820750", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34028389": {"recommendationid": "34028389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109873404", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "last_played": 1516421382}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game.

And boy, am I glad I did.\n\nI wasn't expecting too much from this at first, since I've had quite a lot of disappointments coming from independent developers as of late, however, this game piqued my interest; mainly because of its [i]Horror[/i] tag. I've seen plenty of playthroughs of Horror games, but never actually played one myself before[strike], because I'm a giant pussy[/strike]. Watching the anime ope\u2014I mean, [i]trailer[/i]\u2014didn't help contain my curiosity, either. So, I decided to give this VN a go.\n\nGoing in completely blind, I [spoiler]pressed [i]New Game[/i]\u2014already shitting my pants by doing so, damn it\u2014and[/spoiler] started playing. It took me a few hours to realize that I haven't stopped playing yet. Since then, I've been playing it almost non-stop, whenever I had the time. I've been truly captivated by this game.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]:\n[list]\n  [*]Great voice acting; even the characters who only had a few lines. Typically, I'm not a fan of English dubs, but I think they did a very good job nonetheless.\n  [*]Amazing soundtrack; does a stellar job at encapturing the emotions of certain scenes and setting the tone for the situations at hand.\n  [*]Beautiful art/CGs; very polished, with fluid animations.\n  [*]Tasteful horror aspects; no cheap or predictable jumpscares, and sometimes very subtle. They did a great job at building up tension and creating eerie atmospheres, without overdoing it.\n  [*]Well-rounded characters; every character has something likeable about them, plenty of backstory, and is unique in at least one way or another.\n  [*]Interesting setting; not necessarily anything new, but it's definitely more than just '7 people in a haunted mansion'.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons[/b]:\n[list]\n  [*]Dialogue bugs; on rare occasions, some voice lines are either missing, mixed up, or don't match the written dialogue. This can sometimes be a bit confusing, or make you lose the immersive experience, if only for a moment.\n  [*]Grammatical/spelling errors; there are some every now and then. Most people might not be bothered by most of these, but it sometimes makes you repeat a sentence before continuing.\n[/list]\n\nI'm writing this review after only just finishing my first playthrough, but I can definitely recommend this game to any Horror VN enthusiast. If you're new to visual novels in general, but enjoy playing anything Horror and/or Anime related, I can also recommend you to give this a try. It's well worth the 20 (18, in my case) bucks you spend on it.\n\nOh, and by the way, [spoiler]Ashton's ringtone is the best thing since sliced bread[/spoiler].\n\n[b]Final verdict[/b]: A solid [i]8 out of 10[/i].", "timestamp_created": 1501891394, "timestamp_updated": 1501954211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34025000": {"recommendationid": "34025000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098970498", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501882203}, "language": "english", "review": "I have no words, no adjectives great enough to describe this masterpiece of a game.\nAfter 20 hours in and having cleared the game for the first time, I haven't even unlocked half of the story yet, and I can't wait to see the rest. To see all the possibilities yet do discover!\nThis game is everything I ever wanted in a horror vn and more. I expected a lot when buying and even then I was blown away. Is it worth the money? \nAnd if they charged 60 for this game absolutey yes.\nNow I could be making a bullet list, and I'm going to, but you basically know what you need to know about this game already; \n\n(tl,dr;) if you have ever found enjoyment in horror stories and/or VNs, get this game. Just DO IT.\n\nNow on to the list:\n\nPROS:\n+ It's really long. \n+ Amazing artwork\n+ Everything moves. The sprites, the background, the CGs.. everything has been 2d animated in a way.\n+ There is  voice acting and it's really well done.\n+ The music is very diverse and couldn't be described other than beautiful\n+ The game is really eerie, and the jumpscares are of the pleasent kind. Predictable enough to not get a heart attack but still too unpredictable to not feel scared every time there's a change in mood.\n+ This is one of the first vns I have never felt bored at any part of the story\n+ It is extremly well written. \n+ The charakters feel like actual humans one can care about\n+ So many choices!\n\nI could go on but I feel like I'd be repeating my points. So, of course nothing is in fact perfect and if you start nitpicking then you *can* find some flaws in this game. I'll list the ones I found:\n(The ones that may have been patched in the future are marked with a *)\n\nCONS:\n- The art sometimes comes off as weird (especially hands)\n- it's consitently inconsistent as the sprites, cgs and diary entries all seem to have a different artstyle\n*- the diary entries sometimes update too fast and if you read them right away (like myself) you'll end up spoilering yourself\n- the game is too well written at some parts for my tastes. If you're not a native you'll get exhausted from reading very quickly and being well rested and concentrated is a must for this game if you want to catch the story\n*- the grammar mistakes that occur especially at the end of the game rather often make the point above even worse\n- some of the characters seem forced and cringy. No, you don't need to remind me that Johannes is gay and german at every occation, he can't even pronounce german words properly.\n- Some of the charakter voices aren't as good recorded as others. But it's not that bad really.\n\nSo those are my thoughts on the game. Over all I'll give it a solid                                                                     9.5/10 \n\n(with that it's probably among the 5 best games I have ever rated for myself)", "timestamp_created": 1501884515, "timestamp_updated": 1501884515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34022735": {"recommendationid": "34022735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006255634", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501953037}, "language": "english", "review": "Great writing, great length, lots of choices!

The real gem, however, is the voice acting. It is perfect, you will feel every feelings the voice actors are going for. \n[b] 3. Graphics: Awesome.

As a visual novel, it was fantastic--I love Isabella and Ashton and Zachary and more than anything I love the LGBT representation woven into the game. Each character has a deep backstory that really plays into the game and makes you feel for them. The voice acting, art, and soundtrack are phenomenal. I really, really love this game.\n\nThat being said, if you're looking for a strict \"horror\" genre visual novel then this is probably not the game for you. Are there some disturbing, grotesque images of death and carnage? Yes. Just as I was trying to do a different playthrough today I had to witness Isabella get absolutely obliterated by a car. Do we have a ghost? Yes! However, \"The Letter\" plays off of a lot of horror movie cliches--we've got a spooky, abandoned mansion whose original owners mysteriously died. Lots of urban legends surround it. It just went up on the market! Someone buys it and is surprised that it's haunted. And there's a mysterious chain letter that ties everyone into the curse. Don't get me wrong, this isn't necessarily a bad thing! In fact, the game plays off of these very well! But if you're looking for intestines on the walls and jumpscares that make you wet yourself, then this is not for you. If you're going for a more psychological horror game merged with a dope anime, you've come to the right place.\n\nWhat also was interesting was that the game is broken into seven chapters. Each chapter focuses on the POV of one of the seven main characters--Isabella, Hannah, Zachary, Rebecca, Ashton, and Luke. This was really cool. REALLY cool. Reading each character's thoughts and feelings on a situation really envelops you in the story, and each character is written uniquely according to his or her personality. It was fantastic--but here's my two cents on it.\n\nOf all the characters to end the game on, WHY Luke? Maybe it was just the choices I made and how I just got a very standard ending in my first playthrough, but... why? To put it bluntly, Luke is the biggest jerk in the whole game. He is racist, narcissistic, and at the end of the game when I was in the heat of the moment it felt like Luke did everything he could to diffuse the building tension in the worst possible way. I understand he's selfish and has an \"every man for himself\" attitude, but his anger and refusal to listen and pay attention to the other people around him made me want to bash my head into my keyboard. All the other chapters certainly made up for it, but still.\n\nOne other thing I'd like to address is that some of the audio files for certain lines of dialogue were either absent or read incorrectly, and this became much more prevalent at the end of the game. It may just be a glitch or a bug but it was still sort of jarring to be emotionally invested in a scene and then hear just dead silence when another character is supposed to say something.\n\nThe QTE were nigh impossible at some points but that's probably why they're called \"quick-time events\"--you have the option to skip them though, which is nice sometimes but it made me feel like I was missing out. Basically, git gud.\n\nOverall, though, The Letter is freaking fantastic. I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun new VN to play. I think it's getting horribly overshadowed by Dream Daddy (no shade to Dream Daddy) and I would love to see more people fall as much in love with this game as I did. Please, play this game!

It's a Western Visual Novel with what seems to be a load of cliche tropes and characters. I'm glad I bought it. The Letter manages to make every overused elements of a typical horror story works and on top of that it brings to the table a degree of character building I wasn't expecting. Short version is this: This is an excellent Horror Visual Novel, and if you remove the Horror part, it's an excellent Visual Novel as well.\n\nThe premise is perhaps not the most innovative. Haunted mansion. Cursed object. A sizable cast of distinctive characters. A creepy the ring-esque monster woman. The Letter has all the makings of another Horror Story 101, and indeed if it was a film there may not be anything entirely unique about it. What makes the Letter stands out is in its outstanding presentation. The game uses the format of a Visual Novel to make the story much more engaging than it theoretically has any right to.\n\nOne of the more impressive element of the game is its cast of characters. A large number of characters isn't entirely new in horror movies. After all, to raise tension, people have to start dying. Characters in a horror story then are often there for practical purpose. Sometimes they're given more depth. Sometimes they serve their purpose and get off the stage. On the surface, this is potentially the case with the Letter. Any character can die. But simply because this is a Visual Novel, their death hold much more meaning. The reason is simple: You are forced to spend hours in their shoes before their potential death. You have to get a handle on their personality and mindset, and then you have to get to know them as people, know their hopes and aspirations, fears and insecurities. Because you get to know them as people first, knowing you could potentially end this person's life just by choosing wrong is harrowing in a way that no passive medium like films or books can manage. The Letter has no protagonist. No one has the plot armor. If your character reaches an ending where they die, the story moves on without them, and the story branches appropriately. The game took me approximately 14 hours to complete the first time, but because very choice have an impact of some kind, the game feels much more dynamic despite being in a way more linear than most visual novels. There is a specific end point you will reach, but the staggering variations you can take to get there as well as the number of possible outcomes after the game finishes mean that your playthrough feel much more personal and involving than it would in most other visual novels. The Letter is perhaps the best example I know of where pseudo-linearity is done so masterfully it trumps branching pathways.\n\nSupplementing this are the characters themselves. They are a diverse bunch with more depth than I expected at first glance. Despite what I had suspected, I enjoyed every chapter, each of which is from the perspective of one of the seven playable characters. Despite being marketed as a Horror Visual Novel, I personally find the character building aspect of the story more engaging than the horror aspect, and the horror aspect as I said is rather excellent. On top of this, their relationship is a joy to watch. I find myself unabashedly excited when I see two characters interact for the first time, knowing their differences will make for a spectacle. Other times, seeing an interaction from one character's perspective before seeing the same interaction from the other character's point of view does wonders in illuminating both their circumstances and points of view. The Letter may not be the first Visual Novel to do this, but it's certainly the one that made me wish this was done a lot more in this medium.\n\nThe game is very impressive in term of Production Value as well. The sound effect is appropriately creepy when it needs to be. The soundtrack sets the mood competently even if it may not be very memorable. The voice acting is a joy to listen to (though I can't attest to how authentic the accents are, I do find them terribly entertaining, especially Luke's). The CGs are beautiful or harrowing. The static sprites are expressive and generally excellent. The animated sprites and backgrounds help make the game looks more dynamic than almost any other game of this genre. The Letter looks and sounds much better than most other visual novels on the market right now and it's doubly surprising considering this is Yangyang Mobile's first game on Steam.\n\nIn my personal playthrough, I encountered a couple of minor technical hiccups. The Story Branch function does not work for Chapter 7. There are rare instances when dialogue are not accompanied by any voice acting at all, or when the written dialogue does not entirely match up with what the character is saying. There are also one or two minor typos here and there, but rare enough that I never thought to keep count. These are incredibly minor problems however, and are completely overshadowed by the otherwise impressive technical feats the game has accomplished. Since the Letter is quite new as of the time I finished the game, it's likely the developer will iron these out in time.\n\nI do have two main criticisms for the game, and both have to do with the ending. Firstly, I personally find the climax unsatisfying. There are two endings the average players will likely encounter, and let's just say even the achievement seems to be aware of how ridiculously anti-climatic they are. There is a True Ending, and while it is somewhat less of an anti-climax, I personally think that the story did not build up to this path enough for the story to conclude satisfactorily. Furthermore, even the true ending leaves several questions unanswered. I enjoy the variations you can achieve in the Epilogue, but considering of how impressive the rest of the game is, the fact that they are still, uncolored images narrated by a dozen or so lines of text for each character leaves me thinking they could have put a tad more effort into them. The other criticism I have is in the nature of the True Ending itself. I personally believe that the existence of a True Path reduces meanings from all other paths. Sometimes, this is necessary. For the Letter, I am on the fence on whether it is. Furthermore, achieving the True Ending is incredibly unintuitive. To avoid spoilers, I'll only say that you have to do several things that most players would consider \"failing.\" It is interesting for a Visual Novel to force the player to go against their instinct as a player, but as far as I know (and there's a chance I'm wrong), there is very little to indicate what you need to do and why you need to do these things to achieve the True Ending other than trial and error.\n\nStill, these problems are only a small portion of the entire story, and they do very little to distract from how impressive the rest of the game is. Long story short, the Letter is an excellent Visual Novel that uses its medium to greatly enhance both its horror elements and character building. On top of that, it looks and sounds impressive and should be seen just to see how much you can do to make the format of the medium fresh again. If you are a fan of horror stories or Western Visual Novels in general, I would strongly recommend picking up the Letter.", "timestamp_created": 1501645467, "timestamp_updated": 1501645467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33960610": {"recommendationid": "33960610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245562916", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501728239}, "language": "english", "review": "Having beaten the game many times at this point, I can definitely recommend it!

Very polished yet underwhelming in some aspects. Note that at this point I have only played apparently 50% of the achievements and am open to my opinion being changed if I locate new paths. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I can see that there were some unique positive elements: \n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*]The art: The sprites are animated, which is cool to seem them move. The CGs are also \"animated\" frames that were also mighty impressive. Also the characters as drawn in the CGs were generally consistent with the sprites, always a good sign. The ghost as depicted is quite spooky and it was thrilling to be caught off guard from the jumpscares! \n[*]Audio: Music in general was forgettable, which is both good and bad - it did its job of setting the atmosphere for scenes. The sounds the ghost make are probably the most salient, adding to the spooky mood of the scenes when she appears. \n[*]Character bonds: I'm not using development, but the bonds they already had starting out were nice to see, and it often wove into each of their complex and usually dark pasts. Because their bonds are already there, there isn't much more development in terms of growing them, but there is in maintaining them, which presumably emphasizes that friendships take hard work. \n[/list]\n\nPass:\n[list]\n[*]Gameplay: Note that I disabled QTE (being scared by her presence is enough for me!) so I can't comment on the QTE, but it is a rare feature in most visual novels and thus a plus that they incorporated some gameplay in here. Personally I prefer the game play in 999 where you find clues and piece things together, other people may have different tastes. \n[/list]\n\nCons:\n\n[*]The endings: I was rather disappointed by the quality of endings, though I should've suspected from the 50+ endings that there are. If you've ever played Princess Maker series or Prince Maker: Braveness, you'll know what I'm talking about. Endings that don't really feel complete, and may become a mish-mash of the sum total of relationships you've saved and relationships you've neglected. To me, the ending is a key part of how I judge my VNs, and these endings definitely miss that key memorable quality. An open ending is fine, but they shouldn't be so forgettable I could interchange them and it has little to no impact on building any attachment to the character. Also [spoiler] how did Luke get no jail time despite repeatedly admitting to killing people to climb higher? [/spoiler]\n[*]Skip function: This may be a side note, but many times I found the same lines and scenarios being repeated without me being able to skip them due to letting a different character die. It grew irksome and drew attention to how much repetition there was due to the same scene being shown through the eyes of three or four different characters. \n[*]Narrative: Adding to the above, due to the order the perspectives were shown, some characters near the end [spoiler] Luke [/spoiler] missed out on some development. There were some pivotal scenes that I wish I could have read what they were thinking, because then I have to infer things about them that might not be true, a skill more reserved for real people I deal with. \n[*]Relationships: On purpose I went for the more \"odd\" romances to see if it was possible, which sometimes was for the endings [spoiler] Ashton with Zach is not possible, fyi its friendship-only[/spoiler]. However, throughout the narrative per above, I didn't see the scenes play out through the eyes of the other character, making it more of a one-sided love. Throughout the narrative it was clear what the \"main\" romantic relationships was going to be [spoiler] Ashton with Isabella and Luke and Hannah [/spoiler]. Thus, the other relationships weren't really possible in a sense. I also wanted to see relationships break down in Battle-Royale style but didn't much of that thinking except brief thoughts from Luke.  \n[/list]\n\n[u][b] Overall [/b][/u]\nWould I recommend a buy? Yes, for the price of two movie tickets, you get 10+ hours of entertainment, why not? Plus, you're supporting growing the Visual Novel western marketplace with games that aren't about 'moe girls harems lulz'.\nThere's just the caveat you might find the plot build up disappointing and the endings incomplete, but the characters' bonds with each other from their shared experiences is heartwarming to see.", "timestamp_created": 1501609884, "timestamp_updated": 1501610393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33952906": {"recommendationid": "33952906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390725233", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502036954}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best visual novel games I have ever seen.

"review": "Loved it! Absolutely love it!\n\nI love horror movies and have watched so many that I think I've become permanently deranged. Either way! I bought this game thinking it was a super interesting concept for a VN, given that they are usually self-indulgent evolutions of trashy romance novels. And it was -- a super interesting VN that is, not a trashy romance novel (the romances aren't even a big deal, other than as character motivations and depth). You can easily see the influence of movies like the Grudge and the Ring here, but one of the things that impressed me was that each \"jump scare\" scene with the ghost was different. She hits a lot of horror tropes (under the bed, in a mirror, out of a closet) but never does the same thing twice (not to mention how the same concept for the Grudge that annoyed me -- her stalking people with no seeming logic or rules -- was actually pulled off here really well in contrast). Each character's death is uniquely terrifying and disturbing and really makes this feel like a horror movie/novel hybrid. As much as I wanted everyone to live happily ever after, it was actually so much better to have most or all of them die (especially when a certain character has all of his friends die in quick succession while he is helpless to do anything to save them). There's sex, there's violence. There's racism and allusions to rape. But all of it is done tastefully and none of it seemed gratuitous. That's a HARD thing to accomplish with any genre, but especially horror.\n\nI agree with some other reviewers that this is definitely the best VN I have ever played, worlds ahead of any other. The 3D graphics make everything 10x better rather than 10x worse (like I thought they would). I don't think the creep factor could've been accomplished a fraction as well without it. The QTEs are great too (I didn't realize you could auto-win them until later too). \n\nThe voice acting is SUPERB, though the writing can get a little stilted in some places (nothing new to VNs!) and, I swear, it's like every character has to inner monologue before EVERYTHING they say sometimes ... it's still great. I think the VAs doing Hannah and Rebecca were phenomenal, and a certain death scene atop a building with a certain someone making a last, tearful phone call to the person they love before dying is the most beautiful one in the game (my opinion). I was absolutely blown away by how much emotion and authenticity was put into each performance, even those I was worried about being flat. The VAs actually made the script come to life in a way that had me wanting to hear nothing but dialog the whole game (I originally thought I'd have to turn the sound off to not ruin the lines, but gave it a shot before I did).\n\nIt seemed like they wanted to please a bunch of different interests here, hitting a lot of varied elements all within the same game/story. And somehow, they succeeded. I don't know how. And this has ruined me for other VNs, but that's okay. I hated myself for playing VNs anyways. \n\n10/10, would blindly stumble into ghost-murder again! I assume everyone who plays it dies seven days later?\n\nP.S.\n\"WHY WON'T YOU LOVE ME!\" \n~Lorraine\n\nP.S.S.\n\"Why, everything here is absolutely wonderful! ...

The Letter gives players tons of choices that allow them to craft how the story unfolds. Mind you, it's a massive game and you'll find yourself overwhelmed at the branching trees with each passing chapter. \n\nIf you aren't used to horror games like myself, then you'll find yourself disturbed and feeling unsafe at night. Fortunately, the entirety of the game isn't in a horror setting; there is plenty of heartwarming moments and world-building in-between the scary segments. The writing is sophisticated, and I find myself being well-informed of various cultural dialects and slang. My favorites so far are \"bubble and squeak\" and \"bobfoc\". There are \"triggering elements\" in the story: racial slurs, incest, and the like, but they make for pretty natural storytelling. They aren't there to harm anyone experiencing the story, of course. They are simply a respectable awareness, and I commend the developers for that.\n\nWhat really makes this game immersive is the character development and how characters relate to each other as a whole. The well-delivered voice acting really brings the characters to life, and honestly, I probably wouldn't have appreciated the story as much if it were silent. Every story-shifting choice you make will affect the other characters in later chapters. They will mourn deaths. They will remember what you say.\n\nBe advised that there is a ton of narrative text in the game. If you are just looking to scream and entertain your Youtube viewers, then there's gonna be PLENTY of waiting time for them. It's a visual novel first and foremost, but when the horror stuff happens, it HAPPENS HARDCORE. There are jump scares, but what really gets me is how disturbing they are presented, which brings me to my next bit of praise:\n\nThe artwork and animation in the game really bring pivotal moments to life. The CGs are animated, as well as the talking sprites. The talking sprites have a more cartoonish look compared to their promotional art counterparts, but that's likely because it was easier to skeletal animate. \n\nThe music sets the mood perfectly, and luckily for us scaredy-cats, the ominous tracks warn when a spook is about to happen. MOST of the time, at least.\n\nAs someone who doesn't really play visual novels, I love this game.

The dynamic backgrounds and sprites are great and help bring life to the experience.\n[*]Voice acting - the game is fully voice acted in English, which is well produced. The only thing that irked me about this was some of the accents which made me cringe a tad at points.\n[*]Game length - one full playthrough of the game (with no skipping) took me 15 hours, which for the price and the replayability, is great! I've yet to uncover combinations and endings of the game so I can see putting another lot of this in again at least to get it to completion.\n[*]Game mechanics - for a visual novel, this game rides a lot on the choices leading to places where the game can branch off into multiple different scenes which play out differently.

There are plenty of indepth reviews written already, but I'd like to just add my two cents.\n\n[h1]Pros +[/h1]\n\n[b]Artwork[/b]\nIn short I was blown away by some of the rather exquisite artwork that is featured in this game. Sure, some images were reused for some scenes as is usually the case in VNs but the sheer amount of images in the gallery alone (I haven't even unlocked all of them) says a lot about the dedication the team had. Not to mention the fact that the majority of the game is animated, even if it's just something simple such as lip movement as a character is speaking.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nWhen I wasn't looking at how darn pretty the artwork is, I found myself quite heavily immersed in the story. Truth be told, the game wasn't so scary for me as psychologically thrilling, but the whole character development and backstories definitely kept me intrigued besides that. There is also the fact I haven't done other routes yet, except a fairly safe route: [spoiler]like keeping everyone alive[/spoiler]. I like to think that it's definitely a good thing that the game isn't focused solely on scaring the crap out of you... for me it gives it more meaning.\n\n[b]Characters[/b]\nIn total there are 7 characters in which you get to play throughout the game - each character having its own chapter in the story. The choices you make in this game count towards the progression of the story. Your interactions between characters affects their relationships with each other as well as within which path you will take. Each character has their own unique quirks that make them likeable as well as realistic. I found myself enjoying every single one of them that I played - to say the least, their stories were all equally fascinating to me. \n\n[b]Sound[/b]\nI'll admit, at first the voice acting was a huge turn off. Partially because I don't tend to play visual novels with english voice acting, but also partially because the voice acting wasn't entirely convincing - maybe the issue is that I'm English and it's where the VN is set. That aside though, with how much I enjoyed the whole experience surrounding this VN, I soon got used to the voices (even if some were re-used for different characters) and it wasn't an issue anymore after the first chapter. \n\nAside from the voice acting, the chilling sound effects like the screaming, clicking and all those to be expected from a VN inspired heavily by series such as the grudge, was a good touch. Especially when combined with quick-time events. This did actually add the right amount of tension and atmosphere, which is very, [i]very[/i] important in a horror game. And finally even the background music was a very well-thought out part of the VN, whether that be eerie sounds breaking through the night or classical music to denote the joyful sides of each chapter. Just yet more things which added to the immersion for me.\n\n[h1]Cons -[/h1]\n\nI have not much in ways of which to fault the game in itself, the only thing I found was how lacking the horror aspect of the game was. I went into this VN fully expecting it to scare me, but in actuality most of the game focuses on the characters and their lives. Sure, there are brief intermissions of horror but definitely not the higher amount that I originally expected.

Das ganze wird mit Hintergrundger\u00e4uschen und Musik unterlegt, die dem Spiel einen klasse Atmosph\u00e4re verleihen. Die Horrorelemente sind immer pr\u00e4sent - und zumindest bei mir stellte sich im sp\u00e4teren Spielverlauf in gewissen Situationen immer mal wieder ne schleichende Unruhe ein - Auch hier: Geile Atmosph\u00e4re, keine billigen Jumpscares sondern viel eher Psycho-Horror und absto\u00dfende Bilder. Ein wenig komisch sind die Quicktime-Events, die man jedoch \u00fcberspringen und somit ggf auch ignorieren kann.\n\nAlles in allem finde ich das Spiel schon jetzt echt klasse und wei\u00df, dass ich etliche weitere Stunden drin versenken werde. Mir gef\u00e4llt der Humor und der Horror des Spiels sehr gut und ich kann es Leuten die VNs mit Mysterie/Horrorelementen m\u00f6gen nur ans Herz legen! Auch Fans von japanischen Horrorfilmen wie The Ring oder The Grudge sollten es sich mal angucken und sich ne Meinung zu machen :D\n\n[EDIT: Auch nach dem ersten Playthrough bleibt die Story interessant und ich will mehr \u00fcber das Spiel herausfinden! Das Ende kl\u00e4r fast alle Ungereimtheiten und rundet die Story ja nach Ergeignissen sehr detailliert ab - Ich bin erstaunt dr\u00fcber wie variabel das Spiel ist!]\n\nWenn euch das Gelesene gefallen hat, schaut doch mal bei unserem Twitter-Channel vorbei, \u00fcber den der Rest unserer Medien zu finden ist: https://twitter.com/DerGamerscast !", "timestamp_created": 1501440905, "timestamp_updated": 1502000462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33902683": {"recommendationid": "33902683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065467085", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504251283}, "language": "english", "review": "I've already finished it thrice and there's still so much playability left!\n\nPros: the story is amazing, all your decisions weave together seamlessly\nCons: there's still some bugs to patch, QTEs are kind of tacky but you can turn those off/skip them\n???: that ending I got where all the women were BFFs with Luke wtf.", "timestamp_created": 1501414253, "timestamp_updated": 1501414253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472103", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33901465": {"recommendationid": "33901465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198366579697", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502546744}, "language": "english", "review": "Been playing this game for hour and got my first ending, heck I have a shit ton of save files branching off here and there and I can tell you the replay rate for this game is high!\n\nMy first encounter with this game is from Youtube but when I found The Dairy on app store and played as Rebecca (My Queen), I was already set on buying this game as soon as it came out! I was not dissapointed with the game, from CGs to the BGM, the sceneries and the plot, everything is very entertaining, engrossing and just beautifully well-made.\n\nThough honestly, from my first ending experience I only have currently, the ghost is such a...little shit. I want to help her, Zach want to help her, everyone does but WOW DOES SHE MAKES THIS EASY. \"Help me, help me, come closer and I'll kill you all!\" ...Yeah.\n\nHell, I really love what you did with all the criss-cross of stories and each choices impacts on how the story played out. I also got my AshxRebecca ending so I'm 900000% more satisfied than I would have been because just 10min into the game my heart was already breaking thanks to Ash's affection for Belle at first. This is from someone who plays The Dairy of course, and I do wish My Queen would have a happy ending with Ash. Though, playing The Dairy and play this makes me feel so, woah, like, the plot man, Lucille in The Dairy and all and how their relationships are right now. It's just so...Wow.\n\nNot to mention that I love Rebecca's character so much, she's my main reason for playing this game! And her death, oh my sweetheart...Comparing it to the others' deaths, I'm actually...Quite satisfied with what you did with her. Thank you. I feel very much dead inside but it's a good kind of dead.\n\nFor a horror visual novel, I'll give this an 8.5/10, the plot is great and the deduction may be from a personal feeling of mine about the plot and ghost but it is still very worth a shot to play and worth the money.

The horror is nicely place throughout the game and also lets some breathing space so that the reader can take a break from the horror element before being put back. Of course the breathing space are sometimes long before getting thrown back into the horror aspect, which made me sometimes forget I was reading a horror visual novel, but also gets me good when the main antagonist appears once more. The horror is definitely inspired by The Ring and Ju-ON as stated in the description of the game, but also reminds me of Until Dawn with its branching tree with each chapters.     \n\nSpeaking of the chapters, each of seven chapters are played by one of the seven characters that are introduced in the game that saw the\"Letter\". Each character chapter talks about how they deal with not only the curse of the Letter, but also their own burdens whether is past or present, which sometimes the antagoinist uses against them throughout the chapter. As mention before, each chapter has its own branching tree so they're many ways that the story can play out and needs to be play more than once in order to get every ending there is. Also the chapters are long, the first one being over 2 hours, and chapter 6 and 7 are the longest out of all of them.\n\nNow the visual of the game, I must say I love the artwork and little animation done with the game. The few backgrounds that are in the game are beautiful and detail, the character model are nice and simple, but the art pieces that I love the most about the game are CGs. There was so much effort that was put into those pieces, that and a long with the animation, that I had to stop reading admired them, especially when it came down to showing the antagonist. Oh man I can still see those images everytime the antagonist appear.\n\nThere is also voice acting, which I wasn't expecting to great to begin with, but it prove me wrong. The voice acting is nice to listen to while the characters read their dialogue, even the two character's voices that I didn't care about at the start started sticking to me that I didn't mind it at the end. Again though my favorite voice acting, or should I say noices, are from the antagonist, from the crying to the laughs to when she actually talks in the later stories.\n\nNow do the characters in the game stand out? I say yes, not because of their simple designs, but because of their personality. It's their personalities that I started caring for these characters from the first chapter, well except for one, but in later chapters you learn even more about the characters and now I loved all of them. So much so that I don't want to see any of them die.\n\nMy overall conclusion to this visual novel is definitely give it a read, even if it's just for a one time read. With the length of each chapter and also with the branching tree of each of them makes the price worth it. The only problem that I have with the game is that even though I love the designs of the background, you will see the same backgrounds, whether it's morning or evening, throughout all seven chapters and can getting bored with them until a new one appears.", "timestamp_created": 1501382110, "timestamp_updated": 1501382265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555556", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33892897": {"recommendationid": "33892897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081509902", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501303118}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "The Letter se mostrou um VN acima do que eu esperava.

This game is about a curse but by playing the game you also get cursed by getting so addicted to this game you just cant and dont want to stop because its so good. So far i am on chapter 6 and tomorrow i am planning of finishing this game. Its so fun to see things from other people's perspectives you may see a lot of scenes you saw before in the game but from someone els his viewpoint but that makes this game so good its really interesting to watch it from someone els his view and able to understand that character. The storyline and the characters in this game are also sooooooooooo good,Most of the characters are likeble and loveable the scary scenes are also sooooooooo good. \n\n\n\nThere are moments in this game that its a little bit calm and lots of talking scenes but then when you wont expect it something scary happends. There are not a lot of jumpscares but the few that are in it are REALLY good. My only little complainment is that they should have choose another look for the evil ghost it looks a lot like the ones from the movies the grudge and the ring. The choices are also really good and have real conseqences you wont see them right away but in chapter 3 and 4 you see that the choices that you made earlier really have impact on the story and the characters. Each chapter has different endings, You choose if the character that you play lives or dies and it will all lead and build up for the big finale were it all ends. How it will end? You will have to play it yourself to discover it The game has 3 different epulogues it depence on the characters who survived and who died?

I think, the last time I wrote something like that, was in my review for \"Danganronpa\" and this game... Oh, boy, this game offers so much more than I was expecting.\n\n[h1]What's great?[/h1]\n\n[b]Plot. [/b]Simple, but interesting concept (remember those annoying chain letters?) gets turned into something incredibly complicated and engaging. It was obviously inspired by Asian horror movies [spoiler]pale lady, long black hair all over her face, crawling around and making scary noises[/spoiler] - yes, we've seen it a thousands of times, but it was done in truly outstanding way. You have curse, you have hunted mansion, mysteries of the past, yadda, yadda, all those classic horror elements, but everything works perfectly, thus showing, that cliches aren't necessary a bad thing, as long as you use them to tell a compelling story.\n\n[b]Characters.[/b] There are seven main characters, each one with their own chapter, each with their own issues, interests and decisions, that will impact not only the main story, but their relationship with each other. The best thing any story can do, is make you care about characters. With horrors, it's especially important, since it makes everything much more engaging and tense. I cared about every single one them - Becca, Ash, Belle, Zach, Hannah, Marianne, even Luke. [spoiler] Yes, Luke! Guy, I literally hated during first four chapters, to then completely change my mind and consider him my favorite protagonist - that proves how good the writing for this game is.[/spoiler] Characters are complicated and even though I found some of their behaviors unrealistic, it was never breaking the immersion.\n\n[b]Visuals![/b] Moving sprites. Moving backgrounds. Moving CGs. I generally don't care that much about visual side of games, but here, art is not only incredible, but also adds so much to the atmosphere. [spoiler]Whenever the monster shows up... Wow. I could feel like something is crawling on my skin. [/spoiler]\n\n[b]Sounds. [/b]This is literally the most important thing, when we talk about horror games. \"The Letter\" has amazing sound design. The music is great, it always fits the atmosphere of the scenes, and sounds, no matter if it we talk about frightening screams or gentle laughs, or some stuff going in the background, make this game incredibly immersive experience. Also, it has voice acting. I don't like to play visual novels with V/A, but I've turned it on during few scenes, and it's good.\n\n[b]Fear.[/b] Fear, just as humor, is very subjective thing. Games like FNAF and dozens of \"Fnaf wannabies\" made a lot of people believe that jumpscares are just cheap horror tricks, with no substance. I disagree with that - good jumpscare, in the right moment, is something that will make your skin crawl. This game has jumpscares - great jumpscares, may I add. It also has gore. It has psychological horror. It has pretty much everything you could expect from a title like this. Whatever you enjoy, when it comes to horror, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[b]Choices matters.[/b] Finally. Even those little ones, that affects how characters think about each other, how they react in certain situations, and so on. But there are also big choices. The one that affects who survive and who doesn't, how the story will go, and how will it end. \"The Letter\" offers more branching paths than I've ever seen, with many endings and possibilities. \n\n[h1]In short:[/h1] \n\nIf you like either good horror stories, or good visual novels, it's a must have. It's absolutely worth the price, visuals are outstanding and pretty much set a new level for other games in that genre, the sound design is amazing, voice acting is good, plot is deep and engaging, with great characters and both darker and lighter moments. Add to that, important choices and branching paths, and you have a nearly perfect game. Or just perfect.

I supported this game since following yang yang mobile's twitter account. And I can say it was worth the wait. \n\nThe story I can say makes me feel like alice in wonderland, you don't know where your going when making choices and every chapter was an adventure on it's own. Which I enjoy the butterfly effect in these kinds of games(like until dawn and life is strange). The art I can say was indeed breath taking. Each CG's felt like a painting in a museum. I also love the fact that the backgrounds and CG's move a bit, which you don't see a lot in visual novels(at least some I have read before). I love how it brings life to game. And goodness, do not get me started on the soundtrack and sounds in the game. They were both pleasing to the ears and bone chilling with horror. \n\nI think the only flaws I had with the game would be the slightly hard QTE's which could be just me not used to playing on the laptop(But it's not a bad thing when the QTE's are hard and makes you want to try harder at beating it) and a few voice errors here and there(like no one saying their line when talking or saying something else while it didn't match to what was being said on the message box). There's was even one part when someone said 'Thank you, Zach' which the message box said [Thank you, Marianne]. \n\nBut other then that, I enjoy the game over all. 9/10 for this game!", "timestamp_created": 1501282700, "timestamp_updated": 1501282700, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505300", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33861601": {"recommendationid": "33861601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008437799", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 249, "last_played": 1516217894}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this VN , so well made , butterfly effects through the entire story , I am currently in chapter 3 and I am loving every minute of it.\nFor 20$ this game is a steal, seriously buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1501264883, "timestamp_updated": 1501264883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505300", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33854904": {"recommendationid": "33854904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169671456", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504130149}, "language": "english", "review": "The Letter is a game that screams passion, from the graphics to the storytelling, it's clear that the dev team put a lot of effort into making this a great visual novel. And in my opinion, they succeeded with flying colours.\n\nPros:\n-The story is well told and manages to stay engaging throughout. In spite of the hundreds of alterations one can make to the story, both minor and major, it rarely, if ever trips over itself and gets past events wrong, making each playthrough feel unique and fulfilling.\n\n-The cast is wonderful and has great interaction with each other. The close group of Ashton, Becca, Bella and Zach was especially loveable. Supporting characters were also well done, though some like Father Norman could have benefitted from more screentime.\n\n- The CGs are some of the best that i've seen in any visual novel to date, and the movement and lighting used in them helps them stand out even more. Background art is also fantastic.\n\n-The music and voice acting is solid all around.\n\nCons\n\n-Though the sprites have some great movement to them, the design and colours used makes them look very simplistic compared to the rest of the games art. Side-characters generally look fine, but some characters like Luke and Marianne look pretty odd.\n\n-The game is pretty buggy in places, especially once the player hits Rebecca's chapter. voices not matching with text, voice clips not playing in general, and some pieces of art in the gallery refuse to unlock ever though i've completed the sections for them. I also can't seem to open up the music room, in spite of having completed almost everything in this game.\n\n-The true ending is very difficult to get and requires a lot of trial and error. It's also disappointingly short, though the ending is engaging overall.\n\nIn the end, this was a fantastic visual novel and a great step for EVNs. I'm looking very forward to the next VN from YangYang Mobile, and i'm also looking forward to it's sister game, Quantum Suicide.

The music really helps set the mood for the scenes, and the sprites are one of the most beautiful I've ever seen in a game.

My usual rating system for Visual Novels are: Story, Graphics, Audio, Gameplay and Characters.\n\nStory:\nThis is a horror themed visual novel, and it has some of the best writing I've seen. While the plot may not be the most intriguing ever, it is tightly woven in the sense that it covers - as far as I can see - everything that you may question about the game. For example, there are 7 main characters in the game. What if 2 characters die? What if A, B and D dies specifically? How will it affect the narration? What kind of responses from the characters are expected? You can try any combination you like, and you will notice that there are tidbits here and there in the narration that will fill in the gaps and enrich the experiences. It is an amazing effort.\n\nNormally, ghost stories love confining characters to a single setting - just the mansion! Just the hotel! Cut off all communications for XXX lousy reasons! - but no. The ghost originates from the mansion and haunts the mansion in ways you dare not imagine, but it also hunts the characters over different places fluidly. It is not bound to one place, and the characters aren't bound to one place (well on the larger scale everyone is bound on the city, planet Earth, the universe yada yada but you get my point). \n\nThis makes for a very organic and realistic experience that is even better than most Japanese Visual Novels out there, since those games usually have locations that are so systematically defined it feels like there are only X amount of locations that exist in the whole general setting (i.e. XXX City). The point is, the world does not feel small here. You will be visiting various settings in the city such as a theater, a mansion, a hostel, an apartment, rooms, a police station, a library, a church, and office and so on. The world is big. It is not just X girls' houses / school / your house and the end, and that is great.\n\nGraphics:\nI'm honestly in awe at the graphics. While I can't claim that it has the best damn graphics in the entire world, it has a unified color tone, excellent background and character sprites and CGs that are ALL ANIMATED. And boy do they look lovely when animated. The CGs especially are fantastic. The beautiful CGs are beautiful, and the creepy CGs are downright terrifying. It's like I'm watching a movie, but with the best shots framed at every second. And did I mention the ghost? The ghost is going to haunt you. You're going shut your eyes in midnight, and ungodly and grosteque shapes will naturally float to your imagination and accompany you in your dreams. It is a gorgeous experience.\n\nAnd the gore. Oh, my god. The gore. I will never wipe the image of poor Isabella from my mind. I personally love Marianne's because of how... immoral it is. Oh, sweet temptation of sins.\n\nThis level of quality is going to spoil me. This is already starting to make some Japanese animation graphics look LAME. That's how good it is.\n\nAudio:\nFirst, before everything else related to audio, I must applaud the English VA. How ironic that a Philipines produced Visual Novel has some of THE BEST English voiceacting I've ever heard. This is movie level quality, if not better because movies have the tendency to go absolutely over the board (Batman, seriously, can you fucking speak NORMALLY for once and not like you're going to murder every cat in the house). This also applies to Japanese VA, which while almost always high quality, takes the word 'overboard' and shoots it all the way to the edge of the galaxy. I never understood why people like high pitched loli voices that are so high pitched the piano probably can't fit said pitch. Kids don't talk like that. HUMANS don't talk like that unless they have a fucking condition, jesus.\n\nTL;DR the voiceacting is awesome. This is handsdown the best English VA I've ever heard from a Visual Novel, and among the absolute best even when compared to Japanese VA. Actually, I doubt there's going to be any Japanese dub that's going to outdo the original VA. I do not believe there will.\n\nNow, onto BGM and sound effects. My judgment in BGM is kinda weak, so I'm just going to say that it's beautiful and well designed. The creepy moments are creepy, the touching moments are touching, it's... really good.\n\nThe sound effects? The game will spook you (or get you prepared for the horror that it's about to unleash upon you) right from the beginning when you click New Game. For some people, the clicking noise is going to scare them every time they hear something similar for the rest of their lives. To say that the sound effects of this game are top notch is a horrendous understatement.\n\nGameplay:\nAs with most visual novels, gameplay elements are few in this game, using QTE elements to enhance the immersion and experience of horror. But if you think that is the weak point of The Letter, I'm sorry not sorry to tell you that the QTE designs of the game put many modern game QTEs out there to shame. Normally you think QTEs as boring. Normally they're just a nuiscance and considered the 'easy' way out of what could've been a satisfying boss fight. In The Letter, when a painfully sharp and well defined mangled head is taking up 90% of your screen and attempting to kill you, the last thing in your mind when dealing with the QTE is ANYTHING but 'boring' or 'easy'. It's hard. You are being fucking murdered by a supernatural being after all, so it's only natural that it's hard.\n\nBut it's not hard without purpose either. You'll notice that the QTEs are designed to fit the scenario appropriately. Button mash (there is only 1 button mash QTE in the game as far as I'm aware, and it's at the very start of the game)? Well that's because your character is trying to wrench the bloody door knob open. Metronome? That's because you're trying to control your breathing and heartbeat in a situation where both are out of control. There's even one that pans the camera horizontally non-stop - and literally, because your character is holding a camera - as you attempt to take a photo of a certain thing in complete darkness...\n\nIf there's one flaw to the game, it would be that there aren't enough QTE moments. No kidding. I quite wish I could be spooked more often, if only because they are so compelling to play.\n\nCharacters:\nLet alone visual novels, this level of characterisation puts games, movies and books to SHAME. Most stories have a character stick to one personality trait and stay there forever. Not this game. Every person is complicated, and every person is a living contradiction. The label 'one dimensional' do not exist in the characters of this game. The writers don't hold back on profanity. The writers don't hold back on issues like racism. Some writers hold back when they try to write a racist character for example, but the writer here states it as the character would have had it. It was a pleasure to read. It's even funny to see people get offended by it by the various behaviors displayed by the characters. I can't even come up with the words to describe the cast of this game, just, play it already.\n\nConclusion:\nBefore I started to play this game, I jokingly thought that the devs had spent billions in development. After playing the game for thirty minutes billions is still an exeggeration, but I cannot help but think if they did spend millions at least on it. $20 for this game is a fucking STEAL.  How can you even price it this low it's RIDICULOUS. This is WAY BETTER than most of the localised Visual Novels currently present on Steam. Any Visual Novel fan who misses this will be missing out on a major milestone in EVN history, the best EVN to date and one of the best VNs in history.\n\nKeep it up, devs!

The art is amazing, the voice acting is phenomenal (I especially love Amanda Lee's voice), the characters are each unique and have their own backstories that draw you in, the music is riveting, and the choices are meaningful. I love the animated sprites and background. The game can be funny, sad, or absolutely horrifying at times.\n\nI was surprised to see the variety of buttons in the UI. Relationships, Branch Tree, Profiles, along with the usual assortment. The relationships panel is clear and concise and changes with each choice made in the game. The brandh tree makes navigating chapters SO EASY and shoots the replay value up tenfold. The profiles of the seven main characters are so detailed, even giving information about the character you didn't know you wanted. There are also diary entries everytime a scene passes in the game for easy reviewal of previously played scenes.\n\nThe QTEs were well-made and aren't so difficult that a typical VN lover wouldn't be able to do them. If you don't like them, you can easily just turn them off in the settings.\n\nMy only small confusion is in the variety of voices. Some of the actors have American accents while others sound British and one even Scottish. It's a little strange but isn't detrimental to the game. The voice acting was done really well regardless.\n\nIf you would like to see some gameplay, I'm playing this full amazing game on YouTube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpmJCat3FiuydDLdO01awqtGQCFBCzjA1", "timestamp_created": 1501108937, "timestamp_updated": 1501108937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507119", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33819039": {"recommendationid": "33819039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194578083", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503389806}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfect Visual Novel for this summer\n\nI came across this game by looking at one of my favorite artists insta story's and thought why not watch the first hour.

I'm a huge fan of both the visual novel genre and psychological horror, and decided to follow The Letter a few weeks before its release. I generally don't buy games until it has received many reviews, but I am so glad I took a chance on this one.\n\nTo list a few of its features:\n\nPros:\n- The choices really DO matter. I love how they included a branching guide to let you know exactly which choice leads to what. It doesn't tell you the actual consequence, so it's spoiler-free. It's the best friend of any completionist, and I fully intend on coming back to it after my first run through.\n\n- Complex characters and character development. People may seem like stereotyped tropes at first, but you slowly realize there is more than meets the eye. I also love the relationship mechanic (and no, it's not otome style), which further fleshes out the characters' personalities, and also affects the branching paths.\n\n- Full voice acting\n\n- Polished graphics and artwork, animated CGs in gallery\n\nCons(?):\n\n- If you are a horror fanatic, this may not give you the thrill you are looking for. While the horror elements are done quite tastefully, the story seems so far to be mostly slice of life interspersed with a few horror scenes. On the other hand, if you do not have the strongest stomach for thrills, this may be perfect for you.\n\nFinal Rating: 9.5/10\nIf you enjoy visual novels and/or horror, this game is a must-try!", "timestamp_created": 1501041190, "timestamp_updated": 1501041190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.660642", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33799890": {"recommendationid": "33799890", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982629830", "num_games_owned": 408, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502029557}, "language": "english", "review": "I've only completed the first chapter and are about a fifth through the second so I will probably edit this review as I progress.\n\nThe letter is a pretty awesome horror visual novel.

I usually have trouble caring about characters from other stories for several hours, but after about 30 minutes I was entirely drawn in.\nThe artwork is very aesthetically pleasing, it really looks very beautiful. Also, the backgrounds have a lot of small interesting touches that add to the immersion.\nThe music is really well done.

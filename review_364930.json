If you are able to form a Yaku, you get a certain amount of points depending on which Yaku you formed. If you were not able to form a Yaku, the card you played stays on the board. Next you draw a card, and see if you are able to use it to form a Yaku. If you are able to form a Yaku you get the points, if not the card stays on the board.\n\n- Whenever you form a Yaku you can either call Koi-Koi or end the round. If you call Koi-Koi the round goes on, giving you a chance to earn more points by forming more Yakus. However, if you are not able to form another Yaku that round, or if your opponent forms a Yaku before you, you might end up getting no points at all that round.\n\n- Whenever a player gains points, the opponent loses that same amount of points. The games goes on for either a fixed amount of rounds, or until a player reaches zero points.\n\nThe rules are fairly simple, and the game gets pretty fun once you are able to memorize all the Yakus, however just like with most other card games this one is also pretty much an RNG-fest, and the luckiest person will usually end up winning.\n\nStill, I [i]did[/i] enjoy it for quite a while.

This game is great for understanding how to play hanafuda, even in real life. I bought a set of cards to play it with friends now, actually. The music is nothing special but nothing bothersome either. I love the new expansion with ukiyo-e cards, even though the original ones were already really pretty. (I am a bit biased, because I study Japanese Edo-period culture with a focus on art)\n\nIf you're looking for a relaxed, easy way to learn how to play Hanafuda, I most certainly recommend this game. If you're into even more pretty Japanese art prints; buy the DLC aswell. \n\nIf you already know how to play Hanafuda, this is probably just \"one of those other\" Asian games like the thousand and one mahjong / go / shogi games that excist.

KOI KOI!\nThis is a great little relaxing card game, providing something with a little more variety to classic solitaire, with an option to multiplay against friends. It's basically picture matching, the aim to to collect more cards and higher value sets than your opponent. Koi Koi uses traditional Japanese Hanafuda cards, which can take a few trial runs to get the unaccustomed Western eye familliar with, but this is a great way to learn how to play. \nThere isn't much else to say. It works well, and there's a few Ukiyo-e style artworks to unlock as you progress through the game. My only gripe is some of the PC-players are maybe a little too easy to beat (they make mistakes, like Koi Koi-ing late in the game at a risky time, or it seems sometimes like the cards are weighted in your favour) but this gets eliminated with multiplayer, where you can play with random strangers as well as against your friends.", "timestamp_created": 1500416051, "timestamp_updated": 1500416051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555585", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33501485": {"recommendationid": "33501485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145584354", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500387455}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u044f \u0443\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043e\u0431 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u0438\u0437 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0430 \"\u041b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0412\u043e\u0439\u043d\u044b\" \u0438 \u0431\u0443\u043a\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0432\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0438 \u0432 \u0441\u0430\u043c \n\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443. \u041c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0437\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0438\u0434 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b, \u0438 \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443 \u0436\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0448\u043b\u0430 \u0433\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e \u044d\u0442\u0438\u043c-\u0432\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043c-\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043c \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0433\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0430\u043c \u043a \u0445\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0444\u0443\u0434\u0430. \u0418 \u0432\u043e\u0442 \u043e\u043d\u0430! \u041e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u043e\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0435 (\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0437\u043b\u043e \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0435 \u0437\u0430 10 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0439), \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0433\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430. \n\u041c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e -

Very easy to learn, with some luck and strategy elements. Hanafuda was developed based on the portuguese deck (now know as the common playing cards deck), but having 12 suits instead of four, one for each month. Each suit is comprised of four cards, some more important than others due to their point value on tricks (yaku). Cards are captured from a central pool (think of Texas Hold'Em, but the cards are taken from it) every time a player shows a card of the same suit. Once a player achieves a trick, he can either end the round or call \"koi-koi\", which makes each trick that player does worth more points. \n\nThe hardest part is to learn the yaku, but once you get what each card represents and where they can be used, this game is blast. It has a great learning curve and the AI is on point.

Le jeu (de cartes) en lui-m\u00eame est cool, pour y jouer depuis quelques ann\u00e9es (merci Summer Wars) avec un pote via les decks Nintendo. Puis il y a eu une appli sur le tel (qui elle au moins a du monde pour jouer en ligne, premier mauvais point de ce jeu), puis enfin le jeu ici pr\u00e9sent durant les soldes d'\u00e9t\u00e9 2017.\n\nLe jeu en lui-m\u00eame a une interface simple, qui fait le taff. Peu d'options de personnalisation, mais ne sommes-nous pas l\u00e0 pour jouer plut\u00f4t que de regarder le dos des cartes? L'unique design des cartes est le plus connu, nous ne sommes pas en terrain inconnu. L'IA est \u00e0 chier (pour ne pas dire autre chose), la gestion de la difficult\u00e9 d\u00e9sesp\u00e9rante (comme h\u00e9las bon nombre de jeux sur ce point)\n\nD\u00e9veloppons: Pour l'IA, point de logique, on court tout droit. L'algo, s'il voit que vous n'avez rien dans vos gains (et votre main dans les haut lvl de difficult\u00e9 (super)), va koi-koi quoiqu'il arrive. Oui, m\u00eame s'il n'a rien de plus. Si \u00e7a d\u00e9passe un certain seuil, il va stopper net, qu'importe sa main (combien de fois, avec 5-6 1point en gain, je l'ai vu s'arr\u00eater avec un gain bidon, alors qu'il avait dans son jeu la quasi exclusivit\u00e9 sur des combo sake/cerisier/lune/random 20points en rab (un autre probl\u00e8me de la gestion de la difficult\u00e9)). En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, IA pr\u00e9dictible, on fait aussi bien en VBA sous Excel. C'est bien pour apprendre \u00e0 g\u00e9rer l'adversaire, son jeu, le sens des priorit\u00e9s; mais une fois ceci pass\u00e9, c'est monotone.\n\nVient ensuite la gestion de la difficult\u00e9. H\u00e9las ressenti sur beaucoup de jeux ou appli (ressenti, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'en \u00eatre s\u00fbr \u00e9videmment. Mais vu les centaines de parties jou\u00e9es, au minimum, je me dis que l'\u00e9chantillon commence \u00e0 \u00eatre pas mal), la gestion de la difficult\u00e9 ne change pas l'IA sous VBA qui court toujours tout droit. Par contre, elle court tout droit avec, au choix: 1/ une main pile compl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 la votre+plateau, histoire de rendre infernale la partie ou, 2/ une main remplie \u00e0 craquer de points avec la correspondance sur le plateau (\u00e0 quelques poign\u00e9es de % pr\u00e8s quand m\u00eame, histoire de dire que le hasard est encore de la partie)\n\nTroisi\u00e8me souci: le jeu en ligne. L'id\u00e9e est bonne, surtout pour un jeu de cartes qui se joue \u00e0 deux. Le probl\u00e8me ne vient pas du jeu en soit (encore que, je ne sais pas, je n'ai pas pu m'y essayer). Le probl\u00e8me, c'est l'absence de joueurs. Il n'y a rien. Personne. Peanuts (non, pas celui de Schulz, pas de Snoopy ici).

been playing as of right now.  If you like card games and/or Japanese culture this game is worth getting.  I got it on sale last fall with the DLC package and it was very reasonably priced.  The in game tutorial I found was very user friendly for someone who has never played Hanafuda before.   I don't normally play card games but I am having a lot of fun playing this game.  Enjoyable background music and the options to change the tutorial guide characters among other options was a nice touch.", "timestamp_created": 1493940891, "timestamp_updated": 1493940891, "voted_up":

I did. This game is definitely hard to parse if you haven't done the tutorial but the ui is simple and you can probably wing your way to a few wins. If you decide to get into the actual game the tutorial does a great job by being quick and easy to understand, which really helps you absorb how to play this cool game. As with all card games there's an inherent random component to the gameplay but it's still really cool trying to picture what plays you could possibly make that would put you in a better position to win. I recommend at least giving this game a shot, as it's really easy to get into and pretty fun as well.", "timestamp_created": 1493367101, "timestamp_updated": 1493367101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31332483": {"recommendationid": "31332483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198341043477", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509711331}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6ca1\u6709\u724c\u6280\uff0c\u5168\u9760\u4eba\u54c1\n\u8f93\u8d62\u770b\u6de1\uff0c\u4e0d\u670d\u5c31\u5e72\n", "timestamp_created": 1493003156, "timestamp_updated": 1493003156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31323438": {"recommendationid": "31323438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210895461", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1515603685}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u4eca\u73fe\u5728\u3067\u306fAI\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u306e\u8a2d\u5b9a\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u3067\nCOM\u304c\u5f37\u3059\u304e\u3066\u307e\u3068\u3082\u306b\u904a\u3093\u3067\u3044\u3089\u308c\u306a\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3046\u3053\u3068\u306f\u7121\u3044\u3067\u3059\n\n\u305f\u3060\u3057COM\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb4\u306b\u95a2\u3057\u3066\u306f\u30b7\u30e3\u30ec\u306b\u306a\u3089\u306a\u3044\u304f\u3089\u3044\u5f37\u304f\u3066\n\u8ca0\u3051\u308c\u3070\u30dc\u30ed\u8ca0\u3051\n\u52dd\u3063\u3066\u3082\u306a\u3093\u3068\u304b\u50c5\u5dee\u3068\u3044\u3046\u307b\u3069\u306b\u5bb9\u8d66\u304c\u7121\u304f\n\u30c1\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u306f\u7121\u3044\u3068\u3044\u3046\u8a00\u8449\u304c\u7591\u308f\u3057\u3044\u304f\u3089\u3044\u306b\u5f37\u3044\u306e\u3067\n\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb3\u4ee5\u4e0b\u306e\u5f37\u3055\u306b\u4e0d\u6e80\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u308a\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u9650\u754c\u306b\u6311\u6226\u3057\u305f\u3044\u4eba\u5411\u3051\u3067\u3059\n\n\u304a\u3068\u306a\u3057\u304f\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb1\u304b2\u3042\u305f\u308a\u3067\n\u52dd\u3061\u65b9\u3084\u904a\u3073\u65b9\u306b\u3053\u3060\u308f\u308a\u3092\u6301\u3061\u3064\u3064\u7121\u53cc\u3059\u308b\u304b\n\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb3\u3042\u305f\u308a\u3067\u52dd\u3064\u304b\u8ca0\u3051\u308b\u304b\u306e\u702c\u6238\u969b\u3092\u5473\u308f\u3063\u305f\u308a\u3068\n\u81ea\u5206\u306e\u5b9f\u529b\u3084\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb\u306b\u5408\u3063\u305f\u904a\u3073\u65b9\u3092\u3057\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046", "timestamp_created": 1492964389, "timestamp_updated": 1492964429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31259625": {"recommendationid": "31259625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033285840", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512080031}, "language": "french", "review": "L'original jeu japonais.\n \nJeu de carte avec des design super travailler comme le jeu traditionnel.\nManque de d\u00e9fis.", "timestamp_created": 1492708177, "timestamp_updated": 1492708177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31218215": {"recommendationid": "31218215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079716134", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492600644}, "language": "schinese", "review": "http://store.steampowered.com/recommended/recommendgame/364930", "timestamp_created": 1492521221, "timestamp_updated": 1492521221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451762", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31141631": {"recommendationid": "31141631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132017334", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "last_played": 1514822168}, "language": "german", "review": "Koi Koi Japan [Hanafuda.

entender, y de disfrutar.\n\nEl juego tiene varias partes, para poder ganar. Pero en todo momento, el juego deja claro qu\u00e9 cartas puedes usar y conseguir\u00e1s la pareja, y qu\u00e9 cartas est\u00e1n sin pareja, y por lo tanto las echas \"a la mesa\" sin conseguir nada en ese momento.\n\n[h1]Objetivo[/h1]\n\nGanar m\u00e1s puntos que el contrario, en cada ronda si es posible, y al final de la partida... (despu\u00e9s de 12 rondas contra la m\u00e1quina,.. y despu\u00e9s de 4 rondas, contra otro jugador/a).\n\nCuando justo acabas de conseguir tu/s primer/os punto/s, entonces el juego te da la posibilidad de hacer \"koi-koi\", \u00e9s decir, seguir jugando, o \"stop\", (parar).\n\nSi decides hacer \"koi-koi\", entonces la partida contin\u00faa, hasta que alguien en lugar de \"koi-koi\", decida parar la ronda la siguiente vez que se consiguen puntos, o hasta que los dos que est\u00e1n jugando se queden sin cartas, y entonces solamente gana un punto el que empez\u00f3 a jugar primero durante esa ronda.\n\nCada vez que haces \"koi-koi\", se acumula un punto a todos los dem\u00e1s que vayas consiguiendo, y a partir del cuarto \"koi-koi\" en la misma ronda, cosa dif\u00edcil de conseguir, entonces ya no sumas un punto sin\u00f3 que multiplicas x2 los dem\u00e1s puntos conseguidos. o x3 con el quinto \"koi-koi\", o x4 con el sexto \"koi-koi\". Pero \u00e9sto es muy, muy dif\u00edcil de conseguir.\n\nSi decides parar, termina la ronda, y s\u00f3lamente el que ha parado el juego se lleva los puntos que hasta ahora has acumulado.\n\n[h1]C\u00f3mo consigo esos puntos[/h1]\n\nEn \u00e9ste juego, existen 4 cartas por mes. [i]Todas las cartas tienen unos dibujos japoneses, que a mi me parecen muy chulos[/i]. Casi todas las cartas de cada mes, tienen algo (casi siempre un tipo de flor, o flores) en com\u00fan, que se parece bastante. Ya dije antes, que el juego ayuda siempre qu\u00e9 carta va con qu\u00e9 otra carta.\n\nPara crear una pareja, tienes que echar \"a la mesa\", una carta de un mes que coincida con una de las cartas \"de la mesa\", y entonces te llevas esas dos cartas, quit\u00e1ndolas \"de la mesa\", y coloc\u00e1ndolas en sus respectivos lugares.\n\n\u00bfCu\u00e1les son esos lugares?\n\nHay 5 cartas que se llaman \"Light\". Si consigues m\u00ednimo 3, o 4 de esas cartas \"especiales\", entonces tienes la posibilidad de conseguir 5, o m\u00e1s puntos.\n\nHay otras cartas, que se llaman \"Seed\". Casi siempre son dibujos de animales, y cuando consigues 3 animales especiales, o m\u00ednimo 5 cartas cualquiera de \u00e9ste grupo, entonces tienes la posibilidad de conseguir 1 punto por cinco cartas juntas, 2 puntos por seis cartas juntas.. (juntando las 3 cartas de animales especiales, dan 5 puntos).\n\nHay otras cartas, que se llaman \"Ribbon\". Siempre son dibujos en los que hay una especie de Cinta de color o Roja, o Azul-Violeta-Lila. Aqu\u00ed tambi\u00e9n pasa que cuando consigues las 3 Cintas Rojas con letras, consigues 5 puntos. Si consigues las 3 Cintas Lilas, tambi\u00e9n son 5 puntos. Si juntas m\u00ednimo 5 cartas con Cintas, entonces son 1 punto. Para 6 cartas con Cintas, entonces 2 puntos. etc..\n\nEl \u00faltimo grupo de cartas, son las llamadas \"Plain\". \u00c9stas son, por decirlo de alguna manera, las cartas comunes. Tienes que juntar como m\u00ednimo 10 de \u00e9ste tipo de cartas, para conseguir 1 punto. Juntando 11 cartas, consigues 2 puntos. etc..\n\n[h1]Carta especial[/h1]\n\nHe dejado para el final, el explicar una sola carta, que tiene un peque\u00f1o bonus. Por lo tanto, es un poco especial por 2 motivos.\n\n1. Cuando consigues emparejar \u00e9sta carta, con otra de su mismo mes, entonces no ganas solamente las 2 cartas, sin\u00f3 que \u00e9sta carta se duplica. Lo normal es que vaya al grupo \"Seed\", pero tambi\u00e9n se junta en el grupo \"Plain\".\n\n2. Cuando \u00e9sta carta, la consigues junto a una, o a dos, del grupo \"Light\" (Una de \u00e9stas dos cartas, tiene una redonda m\u00e1s o menos en el centro, que parece un sol pintado de blanco. Y la otra, tiene un mont\u00f3n de flores de color rosa y rojo), entonces puedes conseguir m\u00ednimo un punto, y depende de las circunstancias, hasta 7 puntos.\n\n//-------\\\\\n\n[h1]Conclusi\u00f3n[/h1]\n\nJuego de cartas, arte japon\u00e9s, m\u00fasica bastante agradable tambi\u00e9n de car\u00e1cter japon\u00e9s (la primera pista es la que me gusta.. las otras cansan un poco al rato), reglas m\u00e1s o menos f\u00e1ciles de entender, rondas bastante r\u00e1pidas si la conexi\u00f3n en multijugador va bien, y en general un juego muy divertido.\n\n[h1]Azar en el juego[/h1]\n\nEso s\u00ed, aviso de que el azar juega, a veces, una parte muy importante en \u00e9ste juego. No por conocer muy buenas estrategias, ganar\u00e1s siempre. Dir\u00eda que hay entre un 10%, y un 30% de azar.

Below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHQdT-7qDuk\n\n\"Hanafuda\" is a traditional Japanese card game now presented to a western audience in its \"Koi Koi\" variation by Zoo Corporation.\n\nHaving little opportunities to play Koi Koi in the past I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of detail and polish put into this game by Zoo Corporation, whose previous works are mostly focused around fan service heavy games such as Delicious! Pretty Girls Mahjong Solitaire.\n\nIn video I play through the tutorial so that those unfamiliar with Hanafuda can understand the game and to display its accessibility to new players.\n\n[i]TLDW:[/i]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b] \n[list]\n[*]Clear interface both in menus and game.\n[*]Simple to pick up, fast addictive gameplay.\n[*]Easy to understand engaging tutorials and many features for beginners such as providing simple aid to show possible card matches and listing card combinations.\n[*]Easy to use customisation opitions with a varity of attractive characters, backgrounds, card sleeves and music.\n[*]Decent AI that slowly grows in difficulty eventually maneuvering to prevent match ups.\n[*]Solid online multiplayer.\n[*]Steam integration including: cards, achievements and leaderboards.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b] \n[list]\n[*]Single Player AI opponents are dull and lack characer, the lack of banter, phrases or real character design makes this feel like a lost opportunity. Whilst the guides have a handful of stock phrases for the begining and end of a game it lacks variation and again leaves the character feeling flat.\n[*]Postcard mode again feels lacking, rewards for beating opponents wins a picture of an area within a location but with no text or description it lacks any substance and is rather dull.\n[*]Postcard mode is rather short due to the nature of Koi-Koi and further single player campaigns require purchase of cheap DLC.\n[*] No way to turn off hint mode which may annoy some players.\n[*]Music grows a little repetitive .\n[/list]\n\nFinal verdict: I certainly don't regret purchasing Koi-Koi Japan and have had quite a bit of fun with the game but it does feel a tad overpriced and lacking depth, however as one of the few version of the card game with a english translation with its great tutorial and hint mode it is a excellent gateway for people new to the card game.", "timestamp_created": 1487081704, "timestamp_updated": 1487081704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29874611": {"recommendationid": "29874611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149053100", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 875, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506627150}, "language": "german", "review": "Sehr gute Umsetzung.

Man hat es aber nach 2, 3 mal spielen verstanden. \n\nZuerst sieht es nach einem Gl\u00fcckskartenspiel aus. Das t\u00e4uscht aber gewaltig!! Strategie und K\u00f6pfchen ist hier sehr von N\u00f6ten.\n\nDoch Vorsicht: es gibt 48 Karten ( diese sind nach den 12 Monaten verteilt ) und einige Punktekombinationen, die es je Runde zu erspielen gilt. Man wird nicht drum herum kommen, diese Kombinationen auswendig zu lernen. In einem Match kann man aber immer alle Kombinationen nachgucken oder man druckt sie sich einfach aus.\nIn einem Onlinespiel hat man nat\u00fcrlich nicht so viel Zeit, aber bevor man sich am Onlinemodus traut, sollte man sowieso einige Spiele gegen den CPU gemacht haben.\n\nDa mir dieses Spiel sehr gef\u00e4llt, werde ich mir auch solche Karten in physischer Form bestellen. Ein h\u00fcbsches Spiel f\u00fcr sch\u00f6ne entspannte Sommerabende.\n\nZur Software selber:\nHanafuda wurde hier sehr sch\u00f6n umgesetzt. Die Regeln sind die selben wie im richtigen Kartenspiel.\nEs gibt eine textbasierte Erkl\u00e4rung des Spiel und man wird durch ein Tutorial gef\u00fchrt.\nDann kann man schon gegen mehrere CPU Gegner antreten und verschiedene Postkarten und Bilder sammeln, wenn man gewinnt.\nIch empfehle jeden, die 3 Erweiterungen zu kaufen, dass sie neben wenig mehr Content auch je eine Kampagne beinhalten. Man muss auf seiner Tour ca. 50 Gegner besiegen, die immer schwerer werden.\nEs gibt einige Musikst\u00fccke, die man frei ausw\u00e4hlen kann. Auch l\u00e4sst sich der Hintergrund und die Karten ausw\u00e4hlen.\nAuch ein Online Modus mit ELO Rating wurde hinzugef\u00fcgt. Diesen habe ich aber noch nicht getestet. Im Leaderboard vom Februar (es ist im Moment noch fr\u00fch im Februar) l\u00e4sst sich erahnen, dass wohl einige dieses Spiel online spielen.\n\nPreis-Leistung\nIm Sale: zugreifen!!!\nSonst: Hanafuda Fans werden es sich so oder so kaufen... f\u00fcr alle anderen, die einfach n Gelegenheitsspiel suchen doch etwas teuer.\n\nF\u00fcr die Langzeitspielmotivation unbedingt die 3 Erweiterungen kaufen. Ansonsten gibt es ja noch den Online Modus mit Ranking.", "timestamp_created": 1486313997, "timestamp_updated": 1486365517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

I'm tired of fighting it and ended up deleting everything.\n\nIf you can sneak it past your security, I deffinitely recommend this highly addictive game.\n\n___\nUpdate: It looks like the devs have reported the false-positive to the virus checkers and now it's working!

This review is based on v2.2.3.\n\nThat update, v2.0, fixed some of the game's flaws, such as bad animations, and also added a huge feature: online multiplayer. Now, I've had issues with the online myself but it's possible to find players and should be decently playable for most people.\n\nThere's also various AI levels, which I believe weren't there before, letting you choose up to 4 difficulties. It feels as though the entirety of the single-player content has been given a touch up, but it's been a while since I last played before the update.\n\nAnother nice feature that I believe wasn't around before 2.00 is the addition of in-game card and yaku lists. This should let you easily and quickly check up on scoring conditions and such, which should help any newbies get into the game.\n\nThe one issue I see is that there's still basically no rule customization, which is an odd omission but not a very huge one. Other than the number of rounds (6 or 12), you can't really change much.\n\nAnother little issue is that it seems that the \"Enjoy pack\" DLC was phased out with the 2.0 update. This isn't a big deal, however, considering it was a free DLC, but I'm sure someone misses out the Ayano guide and her... big assets. Thankfully, there's a lot of new backgrounds, BGMs and guides in the base game (and more through the cheap DLCs) which make up for this issue. I also believe the \"Enjoy pack\" content was, at least partially, just included into the game, except for Ayano. So, no big deal.\n\nAll said and done, with the confusing animations gone and online multiplayer added (among other things), this is probably the best koi-koi game you can get on PC and a much better game than it was before the 2.0 update. I'm glad to see the developer has supported this little game so well, and is still releasing updates adding new content and fixing old issues.\n\nI recommend it.

It\u2019s an interesting but you\u2019ll not find anyone to play with near you, and you only need two people\u2026 So computer games are the solution. I was afraid the AI would be like some other flash games out there, but it\u2019s competent and not completely unfair cheating busted. You feel that the AI knows how to play the game and has average starting hands. One some of the first moves you\u2019ll even feel the pressure since you know (and will end up seeing) that the virtual opponent does a great job at taking the cards you need in order to prevent you from finishing the set you\u2019ve started preparing.\nSince I\u2019ve last played, a couple of updates came out and DLC. While I bought them, I haven\u2019t played it yet, but I\u2019ve reinstalled the game and I\u2019m about to go back in. So I\u2019m doing this review on the basic version before that. It probably has some expanded tutorial now, but I\u2019m not sure.\nBut Hanafuda is an easy game to learn. You\u2019ll enjoy playing it and learning while playing.\n\nOn a side note, Nintendo started by making cards, Hanafuda cards. They still make them.

First, the rng was incredibly pro computer, making the game really hard to beat and the knowledge of yakus useless, since comp. could decide how to eat you. Now, there's four levels of difficulty, and if they're not finely tuned, at least they do exist.\n\nSecond, the mp part of Koi Koi has still a problem about rng.

But, it's still a good way to learn hanafuda.\n\nSo, does this game worths your money ? Well, yes.

Hanafuda are a set of 48 playing cards split into 12 groups of 4, each group assigned a Month and a Flower. And each group has art related to its month's flower. So for example, January's 4 cards all have Pine tree depictions in them. Within Hanafuda there are 3 types of illustrations, Normal, Ribbon and Specials (usually wildlife or abstract things like Full Moon (August, Susuki Special)). Each of these is assigned different point values.\n\nAll in all I think the concept of Hanafuda cards is really cool. Now on to the most popular game mode, and what this game is actually all about - Koi Koi.\n\nWithin Koi Koi it retains the Months and Flowers assigned to the cards as mentioned as before, but now there are 4 types of cards; Plain, Ribbon, Seed and Light.\nThe game starts with the player (That's you!) picking one of 2 cards, the other being assigned to the opponent. The person with the lowest Month card gets to go first, and is called the \"Oya\" the other person is the \"Ko\".\nThe whole aim of Koi Koi is to form Yaku, or pairs. Each player starts with 8 cards in their hand and then 8 set in the centre of the board. Each player takes turns matching their cards with the ones in the centre, starting with the Oya. The game can last 6 or 12 rounds (depending on your preference).\nOnce a player forms a pair they are able to call Stop, to gain their points, or if you are feeling lucky you can call \"Koi-Koi\"(Ahhh that's the name of the game!!) to attempt to make further pairs and therefore more points but be careful because if your opponent then gets a pair they will block your Yaku and you won't get any points that round.\n\nOnto the actual game; personally, I think that this is executely really well. There's a brief tutorial to get you started and there's always the Yaku, and Cards at the side that can be displayed if you get stuck.\n\nWithin the game there is Single Player and Multiplayer.\nSingle Player has a Training mode, where you battle against your guide character (more on that later), and Collection Mode, where you battle an AI from each area in Japan and gain postcards from that region, which are viewable in the gallery (really nice feature in my personal opinion). There are 5 Postcards for Each Region, 40 in total.\n\nThere's also Multiplayer mode which I have yet to try out, but in it there is Quick Match where you just jump in and play a randomer, or Lobby mode where you can invite friends (if you're lucky enough to have any).\n\nCurrently in the game there are 4 Guide Characters; Meg, Kanna, Mina and Fumi. Each looking quite different from the others, really they just serve as an avatar for practice mode and don't really have much purpose other than that. I guess though you could say they are aesthetically pleasing at least.\nThat leads me on to my next point; the game has really nice colourful visuals and the art on the cards in particular is really nice. There's also 8 card backs to pick from, which is good and everything is laid out nicely. You'll have no problem navigating the menus etc.\nFinally the music. One of my favourite parts of this game. The music just fits the game perfectly, the traditional Japanese sound is sure to be a treat to your ears. You have 4 BGM to choose from and each is a delight.\n\n[h1]In Summary[/h1]\n[b]Positives[/b]\n+ Fun, intuitive gameplay \n+ Great Visuals (UI, Character designs, Postcards, Card designs)\n+ Nice, appropriate Soundtrack\n+ Multiplayer!\n+ Collectables that are actually meaningful\n\n\n[b]Negatives[/b]\n- No way to define difficulty in Practice mode\n- Maybe more of that great music\n- More card back designs?\n- It's too hard to think of Negatives for the game (Wait... That's actually a positive >_<)\n\nAll in all, this is a really fun card game, well worth the \u00a31.39 I paid for it, if not more. Multiplayer and the postcard collectable campaign make the game really replayable.

No bugs found in 3+ hours and if you're engaged in the game there's a lengthy campaing to sink your teeth into. A big bummer is the multiplayer, a brief look once or twice showed very little people playing. Get used to AI matches I guess. \n\nI seriously haven't had this much fun learning and playing a game before, the mechanics are a blast.

When people ask me about it I usually just say \u201cIt's a lot like Go Fish, but with a deck of Japanese flower cards\u201d. This is only partially true, the game is a bit deeper than that, but at it's core the game mixes chance and strategy into a really fun, really unique match game. The cards, the rules and the scoring can appear daunting at first, but once I got the hang of it (I have some experience with this game elsewhere) it is a really great  and unique card game.\n\nThe graphics are crisp in windowed mode. The cards are very easy to identify and look very bright. Other images such as avatar designs, backgrounds, and menu screen are also well designed, uncomplicated, and have a very neat and clear presentation.\n\nThe music can be a bit repetitive, but has been improved immensely in the latest version. WOW! The track playing is a lot softer and more melodic than before, and sounds really well done. It has a very Asian tone to it and is reminiscent of what massage therapists might play during a session. Very relaxing.\n\nI had complained about the card animations a bit in my old version of this review, but that has also been vastly improved. The animations are fluid and easy on the eyes, everything in this game just feels so polished now.\n\nThere are a few areas where the player may customize the looks of the cards and various other options to streamline the overall presentation of the game. It is a nice feature to have, and really shows that a good amount of work has been put into making this a quality game.\n\nThe tutorial is very well written and covers most of the basics. I already knew how to play going in, but I learned a little more simply reading up in the game's tutorial mode. I can see how this would have helped immensely when I'd first picked up Koi-Koi, as this really would have helped demystify the cards and the hands, and helped me to better understand how matching works. In a console version of Hanafuda there was really not much help, so the tutorial here is definitely beneficial.\n\nMore modes would have been nice, especially with changing local rules, which the tutorial itself mentions a couple of times. The rules can change from location to location, but in the game's settings the rules are not alterable except for choosing between 6 rounds or 12 rounds. The option to tailor rules for more advanced players would have been most welcome.\n\n[UPDATE] Multiplayer has been added, which is just fantastic.

You've probably played Solitaire and remember that you need to match the according colours (red on black etc.). Hanafuda requires you to do a bit more: you're supposed to collect cards and form certain patterns, \"yaku\", which will each award you certain points. Obviously, the winner takes it all and whoever has the most points in round 12 wins. I'm saying the learning curve is high because you need to learn the patterns by heart. Deer-boar-flower belongs together. Miss one of the cards when it's on the table and you'll bite yourself. But don't you worry! Simply play some games and try to pick up as much as you can. There's an in-game help which displays all the possible patterns if you need them. \n\nPersonally, I like casual games and sometimes, I just want to relax.  While this game is somewhat difficult at first, you'll soon get the hang of it and enjoy the simplicity of it. For once, you don't need to shoot anybody, you can lay back and make your decisions. It's both rewarding and challenging, a perfect combination. Recently, the game also got updated and is now available in multiplayer mode, which is the main reason why this game is so fantastic. Want to play with your friends and show them you're both smart and relaxed?!

on PC. The only problem here, is this game uses a set of rules that I've never heard of, much less played by. While I do find it interesting and enjoyable, I would also like the option to play by the rules that I was originally taught.\n\nAlso, I would like to add that I bought this game with the understanding that is was already multi-player, only to find out that multi-player functionality had not yet been added. (It still hasn\u2019t, but I\u2019m greatly looking forward to it)\n\nThe art in this game is absolutely stunning, however the animations leave much to be desired. The few animations that are in the game stutter, lag, or just skip entirely. If they worked as they should I would praise this game for its beauty.\n\nOverall, I still enjoy the game and recommend trying it for yourself.

start.\n\nKoi-Koi Japan [Hanafuda playing cards] has a lot of the basics with some clever AI and a quick way to access rules, cards, and how the points are calculated. That's perfect. This game isn't a household game in the west. And these three aspects are INCREDIBLY important because Koi-Koi is the type of game that will play differently from home to home.\n\nThis version of Koi-Koi is nice for playing against AI. It's quick, and you feel a sense of accomplishment when you've bested the opposition. If you want to get some competitive Koi-Koi going, this should scratch that itch well enough.\n\nHowever, there are no variations (to my knowledge) in the rules and point-counting. This may be a minor issue since there is possibly a \"traditional\" version that this game adheres to, but altering the rules for your style is what makes a game like this so appealing. It's why poker has so many variants, or why you can grab a deck of \"Standard\" playing cards and create a multitude of games.\n\nI'm also not a fan of the impossibly-titted hostess of the game. Hanafuda, guys, not hentai.\n\nOtherwise, if you've always been interested in this game and have never had someone to play with, you can't get much better in a virtual environment. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1461990746, "timestamp_updated": 1461990746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632468", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22711962": {"recommendationid": "22711962", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097829232", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512715258}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun game but it might not be the best for those looking to learn how to play hanafuda.

The easy hands to win are hands with recognizable cards - the harder hands require memorizing banners.\n\nIt is possible to learn everything you need from the tutorial and the ingame wiki, but YouTube

The music is soothing though, and I would rather listen to it to relax than play.\n\nThe interface is nice and smooth. Simplistic, at best. Granted, there is no way to turn off the animations that are within the game. When you leave the window, the game ends up being at a standstill. So, if you think you can play while multitasking... It won't work. There is no option to fix this within the game settings either.\n\nPlaying in either Quickplay or Collection mode, there isn't a significant difference besides collecting postcard images in Collection mode. So there really isn't much to go on. There isn't a change of difficulty either. So you're just playing a very linear game through and through.\n\nWhen playing, you are stuck with mouseover hints and, if you accidentally click on a card where there are two options.... there are no take-backs. You HAVE to play that card. There is also no way to skip in-game animations either. So sometimes the game feels a bit stretched out than it should.\n\nAs others have said, it is a very basic hanafuda game and, for the price of $10, you may as well play it as a free flash game or get a free version for your mobile device. So even if you pay for the mobile versions, those at least give you a bang for your buck.

I do agree with the negative review below that says the card movement is a bit choppy but gameplay is still solid. There are so few retail hanafuda games in English, I can only think of the minigame in the Yakuza series on PS3 offhand, so to be able to just boot this up and play is great. I think the AI opponents are quite easy to beat and there is no multiplayer (maybe the devs could put in a play against opponent by IP connection option?) but they're not so easy as to just let you win and it's quite relaxing.", "timestamp_created": 1458305824, "timestamp_updated": 1458305824, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21898460": {"recommendationid": "21898460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014736242", "num_games_owned": 1379, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 6854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492502627}, "language": "schinese", "review": "   \u6d4b\u8bc4\u524d\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u6211\u6709\u4e49\u52a1\u666e\u53ca\u4e00\u4e0b\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1a\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u5728\u65e5\u672c\u53eb\u82b1\u672d\uff0c\u5728\u65e5\u672c\u5176\u5b9e\u5df2\u7ecf\u9c9c\u6709\u4eba\u53bb\u73a9\u513f\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5728\u97e9\u56fd\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u97e9\u56fd\u7684\u56fd\u6c11\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u97e9\u56fd\u53eb\ud654\ud1a0\u97f3\u8bd1\u82b1\u56fe\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u73a9\u513f\u6cd5\u6539\u53d8\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u516b\u516b\u73a9\u513f\u6cd5\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u672c\u8eab\u6ca1\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u96be\u5ea6\u53ef\u8a00\uff0c\u4e24\u4eba\u73a9\u513f\u6cd5\u7684KOI KOI \u5f88\u8bb2\u7a76\u8fd0\u6c14\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u78e8\u78e8\u65f6\u95f4\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u5173\u7684\u3002\u591a\u4eba\u73a9\u513f\u6cd5\u53eb\u82b1\u5408\u308f\u305b\uff0c\u4f1a\u6709\u70b9\u513f\u6280\u672f\u542b\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4e0d\u80fd\u8054\u673a\uff0c\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u5c31\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5f88\u591a\u3002\n  \u6d88\u78e8\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd8\u662f\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4eba\u7fa4\uff0c\u95f2\u7684\u86cb\u75bc\u7684\u673a\u5173\u4e8b\u4e1a\u5355\u4f4d\u4e0a\u73ed\u65cf\uff0c+1\u63a7\uff0c\u6210\u5c31\u5f3a\u8feb\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u52c7\u6562\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e00\u4e0b\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1458281906, "timestamp_updated": 1458281906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709187", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21890634": {"recommendationid": "21890634", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985755906", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488144469}, "language": "french", "review": "Tr\u00e8s bon jeu.

It's simple to learn, but the more you play it, the more you understand how to make the best decisions.\n\nBasically you're trying to form suits (Yaku) that provide a variety of points. But you can only match cards into your suits if there's a corresponding card type on the field, if you can't match cards then you'll need to put down the card on the field, which you will be able to use next turn (Or your opponent might snatch it before it gets there.). So sometimes, if a opponent has almost a complete suit, and you know that your opponent might be waiting for a certain type to go onto the field, then you'll just avoid playing that 1 card so that your opponent might need to discard the card that he requires and you could take it for yourself.\n\nIt's a bit hard to understand but, if you play it just try to learn the Yaku and through experience you'll understand what type of yaku need to be matched with what cards. Each card type has a season/month related to it, and you can only match cards with the same seasons. If you play it, you'll understand it.\n\nBest 1 euro you can spend on steam!\n\nP.S Even though there's a anime girls picture on the game logo, there's nothing anime related in the game itself.", "timestamp_created": 1454855287, "timestamp_updated": 1454855287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21025638": {"recommendationid": "21025638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210113359", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467273925}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7edd\u5bf9\u662f\u5317\u6d77\u9053\u7684\u7535\u8111\u592a\u667a\u80fd\u4e86\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6211\u975e \uff0c\u4e0a\u6765\u56db\u628a\u8fde\u6478\u96e8\u56db\u5149\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0d\u3053\u3044\u3053\u3044\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b27\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u670d\uff0c\u88ab\u6309\u7740\u6253\u5f97\u4e94\u4f53\u6295\u5730\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd8\u597d\u53ea\u662f\u4e00\u5c40\uff0c\u4e00\u8f6e12\u5c40\u6253\u5b8c\u7ec8\u5f52\u8fd8\u662f\u6211\u8d62wwww\u5165\u95e8\u6c34\u5e73\u7a0d\u5fae\u7528\u5fc3\u7b97\u4e00\u4e0b\u724c+\u7535\u8111\u4e0d\u8981\u592a\u6b27\uff0c\u60f3\u5149\u724c\u53d6\u80dc\u8fd8\u662f\u86ee\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u6709\u96be\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u5c31\u597d\u4e86\n\n\u6ca1\u66fe\u60f3\u51fa\u591a\u4eba\u4e86\uff01\uff01\u8fd8\u4ee5\u4e3a\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u4eba\u73a9\u4e0d\u4f1a\u66f4\u65b0\uff08\u3002\n\n\u4f9d\u65e7\u5f88\u8138\uff0c\u6478\u4e0d\u51fa\u5c31\u662f\u6478\u4e0d\u51fa\u7cfb\u5217\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u591a\u4eba\u591a\u5c11\u53ef\u4ee5\u7b97\u8ba1\u5bf9\u65b9\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\u6700\u5173\u952e\u7684\u662f\u4e0d\u7528\u62c5\u5fc3\u7535\u8111\u6ee5\u7528\u804c\u6743\u4f5c\u5f0awwwww\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u52a0\u5165\u89c6\u9891\u529f\u80fd\u8fd9\u6837\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u522b\u4eba\u7684\u8868\u60c5\u731c\u724c\uff08\u867d\u7136\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa", "timestamp_created": 1454853656, "timestamp_updated": 1467275265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21016804": {"recommendationid": "21016804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030838270", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504466051}, "language": "english", "review": "I used to play this with my obaasan for hours when I was a little kid.

Bei Koi-Koi handelt es sich um eine Spielvariante des japanischen Kartenspiels Hanafuda, welches vermutlich am ehesten mit unserem Quartett verglichen werden kann. Es geht darum, bestimmte Karten zu sammeln die zusammen eine Kombination ergeben, wie z.B. Hirsch, Eber und Schmetterling. Je nachdem wie viele Karten die Kombination beinhaltet und wie schwer es ist an diese heranzukommen geben die einzelnen Kombinationen unterschiedlich viele Punkte. Jeder Spieler startet mit 30 Punkten. Hat man erst einmal eine Kombination zusammen kann man entweder die Runde beenden und dem Gegner Punkte klauen oder man kann Koi-Koi sagen und weitermachen. Dadurch besteht die Chance weitere Kombinationen zu bekommen und somit mehr Punkte zu erhalten. Allerdings sollte dies immer gut abgew\u00e4gt werden, denn wenn der Gegner vor einem eine Kombination zusammen bekommt, kann er nun das Spiel beenden und man selbst geht dann leer aus, denn der Verlierer einer Runde bekommt keine Punkte, selbst wenn er Kombinationen hat. Vorausschauende Planung ist also sehr zu empfehlen. Allerdings bringt die beste Planung und Strategie manchmal nichts, denn wie eigentlich alle Kartenspiele ist auch Koi-Koi zum Teil ein Gl\u00fccksspiel. Wenn man keine passenden Karten erh\u00e4lt und der Gegner st\u00e4ndig, ist die Niederlage fast sicher, nur die KI, die sich manchmal recht d\u00e4mlich anstellt kann einem dann noch helfen. Gewonnen hat der Spieler, der nach 6 Runden (oder 12, je nach Einstellung) die meisten Punkte hat oder der Spieler, der es vor der letzten Runde schafft die Punkte seines Gegners auf 0 zu bringen.\nWelche Karten zusammen passen zeigt einem das Spiel freundlicherweise immer an, wenn man \u00fcber die entsprechenden Karten f\u00e4hrt und dazugeh\u00f6rende hat. Zudem kann man jederzeit nachschlagen welche Kombinationen es gibt und wie viele Punkte sie bringen, was vor allem am Anfang sehr praktisch ist wenn man es noch nicht auswendig kennt.\nDie Musik ist angenehm und passt wunderbar zu der japanischen Atmosph\u00e4re. Gleiches gilt f\u00fcr die Kartenmotive die zudem sehr authentisch sind (soweit ich das beurteilen kann). Ich w\u00fcrde im \u00fcbrigen jedem, der sich f\u00fcr dieses Spiel entschlie\u00dft das kostenlose DLC \u201eEnjoy Pack\u201c empfehlen. Zum einen nat\u00fcrlich weil es umsonst ist, zum anderen aber auch, weil es zus\u00e4tzliche Musiktitel und Kartenr\u00fcckseiten zum Spiel hinzuf\u00fcgt, die das ganze etwas abwechslungsreicher machen.\nInsgesamt ein solides Spiel, dass ich jedem, der Kartenspiele mag oder etwas f\u00fcr zwischendurch sucht, empfehlen kann. Den Originalpreis von 10 \u20ac w\u00fcrde ich zwar nicht f\u00fcr dieses Spiel ausgeben aber wenn es im Sale ist kann man ruhig zugreifen.\n\nEDIT: Mittlerweile gibt es auch einen Multiplayer Modus. Dieser ist zwar leider nahezu tot, aber wenn man dann doch mal jemanden findet macht es tierisch viel Spa\u00df.

Like they said on the trailer 'enjoy beautiful japanese sceneries' (makes me want to go there someday)\n-A good brain-boosting activity -for me-\n~It teaches you something new\n~laugh at yourself when you lose\n~it's challenging -for me- because I am sure you'll always want to get YAKU/combination card in this game\n~it's a skill you can build on like (memorize the basic of the gameplay/focus on understanding basic ideas/relate information or strategy to what you already know  and then try it for the next game, review what you have learned when you lose/why you lose)\n~It's refreshing -for me- because... looks like my brain always remember 'word' these day when I have to visualize something. So personally, I think that rather than try to get your brain to remember 'some words' symbols, attach the meaning of those symbols to 'visual' cues and concepts for easier retrieval. I mean, just memorize what is the meaning of each card. I know this is sounds kinda useless, but it's fun for me because it make me learn something new about the depth of traditional japanese card game.\n-Have good tutorial  (quickly explaining the basics)\n-I like the bgm of koi koi mode. It make me feel like rush mode xD\n\n\n\n!I hope they will add 'multiplayer' feature\n!It will be more insteresting if they also tell about the areas (kansai/hokkaido/etc)\n!Can be more easy if when the cursor is on the card-> the info text of the card will show up (so we don't have to memorize each card from cards deck info)\n", "timestamp_created": 1451570415, "timestamp_updated": 1451570415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20148104": {"recommendationid": "20148104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015685363", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467633587}, "language": "english", "review": "- edit: They updated recently to include online multiplayer. Updates on this review at the bottom.\n\nA great intro to the game of Koi-Koi.\n\nThe rules may seem daunting at first. The tutorial is alright, but because of the sheer amount of info (you're learning to play a new card game after all), much of it actually flies over your head even if you're paying attention. But when you start to play the interface lights up matching cards, which makes it easier especially for beginners.\n\nAfter you get the hang of matching cards is when the real game begins. The AI is clever and is seriously trying to form the right cards, and will mercilessly beat you whenever possible.\n\nGraphics are simple and clean, sound is alright. Music is traditional, which is perfect.\n\nIt has a sort of career mode called \"Collection mode\" where you challenge players from different regions to collect postcards.\n\nAll in all, great fun if you have the patience and determination to learn it.\n\n- edit: The online multiplayer is a nice touch, but because of a lack of popularity there may not be a lot of players waiting in quick matching. Still you can play with friends, which is definitely better than what this game was before, as I was already happy with it prior to multiplayer being introduced.\n\nThe new UI makes it even easier to see possible matches, so you only need to worry about combinations.\n\nOne issue I had with the recent update though was that I was unable to update the game normally via Steam. Steam kept giving an error. So I had to delete local files first and reinstall. After that, no more problems.

Well, for beginners like myself, it is not easy to know and memorize all the cards combination required to win the game. You just have to play many times to get an idea how to go about. While winning is the main objective, it is crucial to know what cards to play even if your hand isn't good, to prevent your opponent from winning. \n\nThere are two game modes aside from Tutorial -- Quick Play and Collection Mode. In Collection Mode, there is a map of Japan divided in 8 areas where you get to play against the person of each area. Winning a match will get you a postcard from the area; each area has 5 postcards to collect, which is essential for achievement.\n\nWhile the game can be rather repetitive, it is fairly enjoyable.

So I do recommend, it is a good purchase. But do so at your own risk.\n\nI don't know anything at all about Hanafuda, but that is why I got the game. Probably still don't cause the tutorial talked about local rules and there are different \"regions\" you can play, but nothing seemed differet. And it's a lot of luck and memorization, 48 cards cateforized into the 12 months, 4 cards for each month, and all the combinations of them, with some of those combinations having their own rules of forming.\n\nIt's a really really pretty game. Even without the busty anime women on the stores front page. And she only appears in the tutorial mode, after you download the expansion pack and turn her on. So she can go completely unnoticed and you wouln't cause it's all pretty and traditional japanese stylish. The expansion that comes with the game also as extra cards designs and BGM that are equally as pretty. Art buget was not stingy.\n\nBut when I say luck I mean, Lady Luck is a dominatrix and you're her new bitch, kind of luck. One game I played I was winning 51-9 halfway through the game (there are 60 points total between the two players) and every round after that the com kept winning each round with the biggest point combination and eventually won the game with 2 points a head. I don't think I have ever been so mad at a game. I don't know if I suck or if the AI is suuuuuper hard. \n\nSo it's a play at your own risk game. You may be good, you may bad. I'm probably bad cause I'm still new and I'm playing a against a hanafuda computer.

It is a bit confusing a first, I admit, but there is an in-game visual guide to the card hands.

It caught my attention in a Steam sale.  I was worried it would be super complicated, but the tutorial did a good job of quickly explaining the basics, and then right into Quick Play mode where after a couple games I felt like I had a pretty good idea what I was doing.  It's a fun game, a bit like poker, with the gambling aspect, and the different points for different series.  The hardest part is remembering what goes with what, and the game helps with that by highlighting valid moves, and with easy access to the rules.  Before I knew it I had already sunk a couple hours into my first session, was really enjoying it.  Haven't even touched the \"Collection Mode\" yet.\n\nThe presentation and interface is nice and polished.  It's a mouse and keyboard game, but was perfect to play from bed on the TV using the Steam controller.\n\nI also purchased a physical deck on Amazon for $11, made by Nintendo.  It's an interesting story.  This is an ancient game, but I had no idea Nintendo actually got their start in 1889, selling these cards for 100 years prior to the NES...!  And still make and sell them to this day.\n\nI also just got done streaming the movie Summer Wars on Vudu.  (First time using Vudu.  Can recommend.)  Highly, highly recommend the movie.  Check out a trailer.  Let's just say the card game Hanafuda makes several appearances and is significant to the plot.  But it's a great movie, reminiscent and of similar quality to Studio Ghibli films.  Apparently the game caught quite a few people's attention through that movie as well.\n\nI was a little hesitant to purchase this due to the developers other uh... questionable... titles.

the game.\nCard animations aren't awkward anymore; there is online multiplayer; you can skip the displaying of the hands name by clicking (a huge improvement!). And even the banner isn't ridiculous anymore.\nI have still an issue with the fixed rules and the AI, especially what seemed to be rigging for the few games I played (I have played hanafuda for over 20 years, and I have never experienced this much stacking of same month cards, let alone a case where there was 2 stacks of 3 cards at the start, with the computer opponent owning the last cards for both of them - let's call this incredibly bad luck, for the time being).\n\nFor archive purpose and show how much changed, the previous babbling is below :\n\n[strike]This is a very, very basic hanafuda game.\nFor a start the interface and feel of it is very amateurish. Stills are nice, but once things start go get in motion... I confess before this game, I never would have thought you could fail at animating cards moving over a board. \nThere is also the odd artistic choice on cards here and there, and the omnipresence of the English language, even if you set the game to Japanese.\nThere is of course no multiplayer, because who plays with real people?\nEven against an automated opponent, the pacing of the game is pretty bad on fast setting, with scoring being handled by individual banners for each trick, one after the other - if you are familiar with the game, you know this can happen dozens of time in a big hand game.[/strike]\nThen, and this one is a deal-breaker : there is the glaring absence of any (really, [u]any[/u]!) rule customization. They are all hard-set, and you better be glad with them.\nThe AI is also pretty stupid, not attempting to reverse a loss on the final month of a game, and stopping early.\n\n[strike]You can get better, for free. And you can get infinitely better, for a small fee, on any phone or tablet.\n\nAlso, the boob-fishing on the game's Steam banner? Not awkward at all, and very classy![/strike]", "timestamp_created": 1446169270, "timestamp_updated": 1467268090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500489",

It capitalises on you being greedy and punishes you for it a lot.\n3) Brilliant Tutorial\n- I made slides to teach this game to my friends. This game has it all written down and the limits of the what moves you can make and identifying the Yaku immediately helps it with beginners a lot. I think anyone looking to learn Hanafuda should start with the game.\n\nNegatives:\n1) House Rules?\n- The game at one stage said the game is played accross Japan with house rules and It would be GREAT if they had that here, especially with their collection mode which honestly needs a bit of more substance for it to have more replay value.\n2) Multiplayer\n- This game badly needs this for the game community to expand. I have actual Hanafuda cards so I can get by without it but having this multiplayer function would be brilliant for this game.\n3) One Trick AI\n- The AI is great and all but its play has little variance. Gets Yaku, 2 cards left? Stops. Gets 3 Brights? Chances are, stops. I have played with my friends and seen ridiculous draws like throwing down a Chrysanthenum card to only pick up a sake cup that just flipped open into double viewing combo (Moon, Sakura and Sake Cup). I don't see the AI having the balls to do that. I know making AI is hard but having some variance in AI, like one that plays more safely, another that plays aggressively will add so much depth into this game.\n\nLooking at the collection mode, I feel that the game missed some chances to make it a Brilliant game because having all those individuals across Japan you can play against might be like some AI gauntlet with each with local house rules or differing AI. That would have been a strong feature that adds a lot of replayability but overall I love when traditional games like this get to see the light of day on Steam and gain a wider audience.

I was kind of uncertain about how to play as the tutorial explains extreme basics of the game and not much else, but after playing a few quick games against the computer opponent you soon learn what's good and what's not.\n\nThe only way I can think to explain it to someone who has never played is it's a little like the  'snap' where you have to match playing cards, only instead of matching a 5 of a suit to another 5 of a suit you have to match flowers/trees of the month to other flowers/trees of the same month to collect cards (So 4 cards/flowers of 12 suits/months) and instead of matching your cards to your opponents, you match them to a selection of cards in the center of the play area. However, matching cards  doesn't mean you get points right away like you would if you were playing snap where you just have to get the most cards to win. Heck you could get points at the start of a round, only to lose them to the opponent at the end of the round. The points system is kind of like a tug of war, and it can go either way.\n\nWhen you get a point-scoring combination of cards you get the option to say 'Koi Koi!' (Come on!) to your opponent. If you (or you opponent) call Koi Koi the music picks up the pace adding to the sense of... I want to say 'urgency' but I'm not sure that's the word I want... But it becomes a lot more fast-paced at least. Saying Koi Koi can mean more points to be won, but also more points to be lost, so it's  a bit of a gamble whether you carry on or not, but I find that's half the fun. Saying no to calling Koi Koi ends the round there.\n\nIt does take a bit of learning for the Yaku cominations, and maybe even for the months of the cards when choosing the dealer for the game, but it's quite fun when you learn it. I was terrified at first because I didn't know any of the months or what flowers or combinations would work, but at the top of a game screen you can click on the 'Cards' or 'Yaku' at any time and look at them. Not only that, but even if you don't look at those and you start a game, if you have any cards that match with the ones in the middle they're highlighted, and it's a helpful feature.\n\nI've only played the Quick Game part of Koi Koi, I haven't tried the Collection mode, so I can't comment on that, but I like what I've played so far.\n\nThis is probably more for those who have an interest in Japan, but if you also have an interest in card games, it might be worth a look at.

The UI and presentation is about as beautiful and simplistic as the Hanafuda deck itself. You can jump in for a match instantly with Quick Play or try Collection Mode, which is a sort of \"campaign\" like mode where you choose a region of Japan and face an opponent in a game of Koi-Koi. The main focus of this mode is to collect postcards that depict beautiful photographs taken in the region you chose previously.\n\nOverall, it's simply Koi-Koi, and that's all you really need a game like this to be. It's presented in a lovely way and there's even a tutorial for new players. The game goes as far as highlighting possible matches for yakus, and even a complete list of both the cards and yakus for you to look over at a glance.\n\nIf you are new to Koi-Koi and are interested in learning to play it, or a long time fan of the age old playing card game, it's certainly worth picking up!", "timestamp_created": 1430244556, "timestamp_updated": 1430244556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15595171": {"recommendationid": "15595171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034828300", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433566714}, "language": "english", "review": "The best UI I have never seen before!\nPlease add Local Multiplayer and it will be perfect game~", "timestamp_created": 1430219299, "timestamp_updated": 1430219299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512069", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15594348": {"recommendationid": "15594348", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993268416", "num_games_owned": 679, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430515058}, "language": "english", "review": "BE WARNED: This game attracts loud asians (and lots of fun)\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1430213501, "timestamp_updated": 1430213501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.364984", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15593418": {"recommendationid": "15593418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131197382", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479321350}, "language": "english", "review": "full screen mode ( want to exit? just alt+tap ) right clik on game icon, and close window.", "timestamp_created": 1430205196, "timestamp_updated": 1430205196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.365673", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15592740": {"recommendationid": "15592740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019448231", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476237734}, "language": "english", "review": "I've only just recently got this game but I saw it had no reveiws so I wanted to spread the love. If your playing becuase you just want to try it out, saw it in an anime movie(Summer Wars), or just becuase, its a great start to teach you how to play the game of Koi Koi. Its pretty bare basics with a bit of a learning curve (mostly with just remembering which card is which and what ones go into a pair), but by played a few rounds you can quickly pick up the basics to the game. If your looking for a different kinda card game to play I defintaly recomend Koi Koi. \n\nThe music is good and it fits the pace of the game, and the coms in quick play are not brutal. I havn't tried the collection mode but I assume it'll work like a tournument getting harder each round. The cards all look really nice and the game also looks nice. The only thing is the lack of a exit button if your in full screen mode. An online multiplayer option would make the game perfect. \n\nOtherwise really fun and worth the money to play if you like Japanese card games/dont mind a learning curve! :) KOI KOI!!", "timestamp_created": 1430199066, "timestamp_updated": 1430199066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.778453", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39555739": {"recommendationid": "39555739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146105747", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 364, "last_played": 1516710789}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7ed9\u4e2a\u5dee\u8bc4, \u9ad8\u7b49\u7ea7\u7535\u8111\u5c31\u662f\u4f5c\u5f0a", "timestamp_created": 1516710996, "timestamp_updated": 1516710996, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39550624": {"recommendationid": "39550624", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049589385", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 41, "last_played": 1516656615}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "muito bom, \u00fanico simplismente maravilhoso.", "timestamp_created": 1516688352, "timestamp_updated": 1516688352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 644, "total_negative": 45, "total_reviews": 689}}

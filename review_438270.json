Entre las formas principales para aprenderlo puede ser con fichas de los caracteres, escribiendo palabras en espa\u00f1ol con hiragana hasta memorizarlo, o si se sabe de antemano ingl\u00e9s se puede usar la app de Dr. Moku, que ayuda a aprender el silabario de una forma bastante did\u00e1ctica. Para maneras r\u00e1pidas que cuesten menos o nada se pueden escribir varios p\u00e1rrafos.\n\nSin embargo, antes de empezar a estudiar formalmente japon\u00e9s, compr\u00e9 este juego, y fue el que me motiv\u00f3 a aprender el idioma, siendo que con la pr\u00e1ctica no es tan dificil en realidad, y pude seguir de una forma m\u00e1s intensiva. Ese es el punto fuerte de este juego y en el que se basa: quitar el formato de clase y ense\u00f1ar sin hacerlo tedioso o m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil de dejar de lado. Antes de jap\u00f3n\u00e9s, aprend\u00ed ingl\u00e9s por obligaci\u00f3n escolar, e intent\u00e9 aprender franc\u00e9s, alem\u00e1n y catal\u00e1n, pero siempre los dej\u00e9 de lado y no continu\u00e9 por desidia y pereza. [strike]PERO ALG\u00daN D\u00cdA LOS RETOMAR\u00c9, LO PROMETO. [/strike]\n\nPero despu\u00e9s de unas lecciones se puede notar que se avanza muy lento, lo cual a algunos les parecer\u00e1 perfecto, pero no es mi caso. En las clases de idioma que tengo, son tres horas a la semana, y en un mes nuestro sensei ya quer\u00eda que supieramos este silabario y el katakana, el silabario que se usa para palabras extranjeras, y la verdad no era tan dificil si se usaba un m\u00e9todo como los que ya mencion\u00e9, y este juego en serio me parece que avanza lento en cuanto al aprendizaje.\n\nLas lecciones consisten en las que son para ense\u00f1ar las nuevas s\u00edlabas, que suelen venir con notas sobre vocabulario y cosas que son como el dakuten, o la pronunciaci\u00f3n de los tsu disminuidos, que son lo que en espa\u00f1ol ser\u00eda como la pronunciaci\u00f3n de una tilde o acento, pronunciaci\u00f3n de s\u00edlabas con \"ll\" o \"ch\", entre otras cosas. En ocaciones habr\u00e1n lecciones extras con cosas como vocabulario o esa \"ortografia\" del japon\u00e9s. Despues de estas lecciones, se pasa a el juego de JRPG cl\u00e1sico, y se pueden repasar todas las lecciones.\n\nRespecto a la jugabilidad, el sistema de juego es como el t\u00edpico RPG japon\u00e9s como Final Fantasy o la saga de Chrono, y tiene una historia simple que cumple con su cometido. En esta fusi\u00f3n con el RPG y las lecciones v\u00ed que la idea suena muy bien, pero b\u00e1sicamente s\u00f3lo se van respondiendo preguntas sobre qu\u00e9 significa cada s\u00edmbolo, y ya. Ese es todo el sistema de combate: responder qu\u00e9 significa el signo del enemigo e irle haciendo da\u00f1o hasta debilitarlo. Esto no s\u00e9 si verlo positiva o negativamente, porque es cierto que el practicar es la escencia del estudio de un idioma, pero se me volvi\u00f3 tedioso, y m\u00e1s en partes que simplemente no alcanzaba a avanzar r\u00e1pidamente al final del nivel, y al no matar a los enemigos a tiempo, va bajando la vida gradualmente hasta agotar los suministros y se complica mucho el juego.\n\nSin duda es importante que existan m\u00e1s juegos anhelando como m\u00ednimo lo que aqu\u00ed se logra, m\u00e1s  all\u00e1 de los juegos infantiles para ense\u00f1ar a sumar y restar, que en verdad sirvan de material did\u00e1ctico a personas de todas las edades. El juego dista a\u00fan de ser una manera de entre las mejores para aprender hiragana, pero s\u00ed puede ser de las mejores para motivar a empezar con el estudio de un lenguaje de una cultura tan interesante e importante como la japonesa.

Your \"attacks\" are any of the characters you know. Enemies take 0 damage from attacks that don't correspond to their picture.

Unfortunately, it has plenty of shortcomings, but I think it's still a worthwhile pick-up if you're looking for something to spruce up your studying a bit.\n\nThe game introduces you to Hiragana characters in sets of 5 and then you go on to \"fight\" them in various locations. In order to deal damage to an enemy Hiragana, you just need to provide the correct sound that Hiragana corresponds to.\n\nPros:\n- Decent RPG with most of the basic elements you would expect (equipment, stats and skills)\n- A kinda decent story, which is a welcome surprise given the game's purpose and subject\n- A few cool music pieces\n- Good in-game lessons and study guides\n- Some vocabulary and phrases besides Hiragana are also provided\n\nCons:\n- Bugs : I had a memory leak occuring around every 30 minutes. Extremely annoying, game would crash. Couple that with the game not having an auto-save feature and you can lose several minutes of progress at a time. Save as often as you can. \n- The game tries a bit too much to be an actual RPG which sometimes gets in the way of learning. Fall a bit behind in equipment or levels and you'll have trouble progressing, which can be annoying if you feel you've already learned the current set of Hiragana already. Thankfully it doesn't take too much to grind yourself back up to where you should be.\n-  Another huge problem I had with the game is that the Hiragana that you fight were not really random and mixed-up. Each fight you get into is more or less against the same Hiragana in every region, making it very hard to learn all the Hiragana properly. As new Hiragana are introduced, you almost never fight any of the older ones, making it really easy to forget them. This should have been the best part of the game for learning and yet it's not there.\n- Some Quality of Life improvements are really missing. Why is there no option to return to base immediately while in a dungeon?\n\nOverall, it's an okay game but there's several improvements that could be made.", "timestamp_created": 1509019591, "timestamp_updated": 1509019591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648454", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36002964": {"recommendationid": "36002964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250942048", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483604061}, "language": "english", "review": "The game play is SUPER boring, but, it does keep you focused enough to do the job you buy it for.

This would be fine, if it were not for the very poor choices in fonts which don't even remain consistent in the game, switching between caligraphy styles and more web-safe fonts.\n\nOther than that, having to 'kill' each character repeatedly over the course of the game is a solid way of giving the player the chance to memorize each character's associated sound. The game also provides minor side lessons on actual words which help show how the characters would sound when pronounced together.\n\n[b]As a game[/b]\nThis is where everything falls apart.

Battles were the main flaw, though wandering through empty mazes  while being battered with random encounters helped bring everything down.\n\nThe idea of the battles was fine. Fight hiragana characters by attacking them with the matching sounds. This was a good idea. The issue a culmination of having a long list of sounds to search through everytime you want to hit something, not being able to click directly on the character once you have the selected sound, then having to do this for each member of your party even if there's not enough characters to go around, possibly multiple times during the battle if you're not strong enough to kill the characters in one hit,  and then waiting for the battle to play out.\n\nIt would have worked much better if each fight was always 4 characters lined up, one for each party member, selecting the sounds for each, and then having it all go down at once with one-hit kills. Incorrect selections would of course result in party members taking damage, and any surviving characters would need to be attacked again, [i]but only by the party member they were lind up with[/i].\n\nHell, even a fast forward button for combat might have made it a less mind-numbing experience.", "timestamp_created": 1504610179, "timestamp_updated": 1504610179, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543197", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34727179": {"recommendationid": "34727179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080980446", "num_games_owned": 425, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504635402}, "language": "french", "review": "J'adore ce jeu, tout est clair et pr\u00e9cis.

Katakana Battle. I'm glad I played that one first, because I don't think I would have given it a shot if this was my introduction to the series.\n\nThere's too many frustrations to enjoy the experience. On the learning side, the \"how to draw\" segments are painfully ambigious for some characters, making it hard to tell when a stroke is actually connected. I wish they would show us the font's rendering of the character during these segments, so that I can tell how to *actually* draw it. Additionally, vocabulary is almost always \"here's the word, next\" rather than any reinforcement learning.\n\nThe gameplay itself, though, is painful. Without a lot - a lot! - of grinding, basic encounters will shred your party. This makes for a very frustrating gameplay loop. I wasn't actually able to finish the game; I got to a point where there was a gauntlet of encounters without healing between, and I couldn't pass it without committing to a lot of grinding. I did cover the entire alphabet before tapping out. The encounter rate is very high, and the map design requires a lot of back-and-forthing, making combats a nuisance. Eventually I just started running from most of them, which probably contributed to my under-poweredness. Enemy encounters were frustratingly non-varied; most areas seem to have only two different sets of enemies, rarely going back to earlier characters.\n\nI recommend this series' Katakana battle, but you're probably better off learning Hiragana somewhere else.", "timestamp_created": 1502059733, "timestamp_updated": 1502059733, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495111", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34043772": {"recommendationid": "34043772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137450965", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504927756}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\nIncredible, I loved the game.

I need various stimulation and hands on involvement to learn well. This game brings you just that, it forces you to think back and relate repeatedly. I find it vital to build that eye-mind recognition. And by a few hours you will have a pretty solid foundation to actually start learning applicable Japanese.    \n\ncons: 1.The enemies come in a pre-set team composition, it would be much better if they are randomly generated. 2.Maybe it's the equipment used but the pronounciation of the materials could be done better, 3,When multiple Hiragana are put together they are pronounced differently then on their own, the game does not provide enough coverage on this.", "timestamp_created": 1501516954, "timestamp_updated": 1501517138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33921337": {"recommendationid": "33921337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099221438", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501481373}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u963b\u6b62\u4e2d\u4e8c\u5144\u59b9\u6bc1\u706d\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u5929\u771f\u7684\u4ee5\u4e3a\u6253\u5b8cnaburo\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f00\u59cb\u5b66\u7247\u5047\u540d\u4e86\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7247\u5047\u540d\u8981\u53e6\u5916\u8d2d\u4e70\uff01\uff01\u91cc\u9762\u7684\u82f1\u8bed\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f88\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e2d\u82f1\u8bed\u770b\u61c2\u5e94\u8be5\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u95ee\u9898~", "timestamp_created": 1501481621, "timestamp_updated": 1501481621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33909260": {"recommendationid": "33909260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068949308", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501436543}, "language": "english", "review": "The Game helped me to get more into Hiragana.

To help you with your studies, I've provided some additional links at the very bottom of this review!\n\nThis game is amazing for people who need a little push in learning hiragana. It teaches you a set of hiragana at a time and makes you fight \"Hiragana Warriors\" with their sound. For example, you will see \"\u3042\" and fight it with \"a.\" There are certain segments of the game that reverses this and makes you fight \"a\" with \"\u3042,\" but unfortunately, you cannot revisit those sections--they're a one-time event.\n\nThe biggest downside to this game is that you cannot use this game to practice all the hiragana it teaches you, While you can revisit areas of the game and fight the same \"blocks\" they assigned, they never toss all the hiragana together outside of boss battles that you cannot revisit--hence why I'm about to link you to outside practice. The downside that you don't see when you don't practice all the hiragana together is that there are several hiragana that can easily be confused that are never presented together, so you might never realize it's a problem unless your practice.\n\nHELPFUL LINKS:\n- Having trouble memorizing some hiragana? [url=https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/]Tofugu[/url] has a mnemonic based learning system that can help you supplement what you're learning in game!\n- As I mentioned earlier, the game does very little to prepare you for [url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Easily_confused_Japanese_kana]easily confused hiragana[/url], so make sure you look over this and practice identifying among them. \n- [url=https://www.duolingo.com/]Duolingo Japanese[/url] has recently come out and is great for that extra practice.\n- Practice as much as you can!

I can highly recommend this game for anyone wanting to learn the basics to Japanese. We all have to start somewhere!\n\n+ Makes learning Hiragana simple\n+ Battle system is easy to understand and gives much nostalgia to anyone who played JRPGs in the 90's\n+ Very easy to view previous lessons\n+ Side quest that teach you new words\n+ A quick look into sentence structure. It's basic, but I believe it'll help me a lot.\n+ No grinding required, but if you wish to, grinding is fun because you're learning the whole time\n+ The soundtrack is surprisingly good and catchy. Wish I could get a download of it\n\n- No real end game content. I was hoping for a place to battle that would help learn new words.\n- Can be kind of too easy at times. But if you find it too easy, you can just run from any battle (except bosses)\n- A few cities on the world map you can't visit. It's a small complaint, but it was leading me to believe there were more side quest and end game content. Nope lol.\n\nAll together, I'd give this game a 9/10.

As a learning tool, I'd say do yourself a favor and skip this game. Instead, get Learn Japanese To Survive! Katakana War, which is much more refined and a great learning tool. Hiragana Battle had me chugging potions left and right, with me unable to keep my characters alive through simple battles. I think this game should be skill based, where I do well in the game if I am learning the Hiragana characters. Instead, it is grind based, where I do well only if I sit through repetitive battles with Hiragana characters I've already mastered, levelling up my heroes to a point where they can actually endure the enemie's attacks. Zones are long, with poorly randomized enemies. For example, the same three Hiragana characters will show over and over in a zone, and it takes away from learning individual characters, instead optimizing learning a set of unrelated characters.\n\n\nOne of the most frustrating aspects of the game is the combat system. If I have four of my heroes attack one Hiragana character, and the third attack kills the Hiragana, the fourth character will send his named attack to a Hiragana that is still alive, which is the wrong name, ineffective and a wasted attack. There is no way to tell how many attacks a Hiragana character needs to take in order to die, so this problem happens over and over again. Again, Katakana War fixed this problem completely, which is why I don't recommend Hiragana Battle. I'd say use something like Duolingo or Ankiweb for learning Hiragana, and use Katakana War to learn Katakana.

I've tried several ways to approach learning hiragana, just for the sake of entertainment and not as a serious endevour.\nLearn Japanese To Survive had an actual good approach to this, integrating repeating a hiragana character over and over until it stuck by making it an integrated combat mechanic. The problem is, that they wanted to fit the Final Fantasy-esque combat ontop it so bad, that it makes the combat extremely boring. Combat is basically this: A Hiragana character can only be damaged by choosing the equivalent English sounding word/letter. Damaged, not killed. So this means, if you know the character, you have to click the same sound multiple times to kill it. So you think for ~2 seconds what the sound is, use ~6 seconds to plot it in (multiple times) and wait ~20 seconds for your choices to resolve. Repetition is key to learning a language, but instead you end up using the majority of the time just finding the sound and waiting for it to resolve.\n\nIf voice recognition is good enough, a better approach would be a voice-controlled Guitar Hero-like game where you could get past the thinking aspect and just get the letters out on reflex.

Level up your characters while doing so >:D\n- Soundtrack is catchy\n\nCon's: \n- As far as I can tell, there is no forced repetition of the vocab that you learn. *EDIT: Can confirm the game does test you on vocabs but it's not for a while so better remember them ;)\n- Can be tedious if you do not enjoy the grindy aspect of the game.\n- Not much to the story. Evil man forces you to learn Japanese :^)\n\n\nTL;DR/Conclusion:\nA good starting point to learning Japanese, but don't expect huge results. \nVery useful for learning how to read and write Hiragana. \nRepetition through lessons and grinding while doing quests. \nDecent soundtrack. \nOnly get this game if you are interested in LEARNING.

The Hiragaana lessons were solid, and the battles were a fun way to memorize them. The actual RPG gameplay, however, could have been much better.\n\nI never felt like I was in any serious danger throughout the game. At the very beginning there were times when a party member got down to around half health or so, but they were very easily brought up to full health and I got through every level without ever once despairing that I may have to back out and try again.\n\nAfter only a minimal amount of grinding to level up and purchase the most updated equipment, I could handle every level without any fear whatsoever. The party handled almost every encounter in one turn, before the Hiragana warriors even had a chance to strike. On the occasions when a battle required two turns and allowed the enemy to hit back, they either missed completely or did 0 damage. Only very rarely did they roll high and do something like 12 damage, which was negligible.\n\nThe magic system is a joke. The characters have an M.Attack parameter, which is strange because there are no magic attacks. There's a spell to give all characters a boost to defense, which is useless when the characters almost never get hit. There's a spell to give a boost to attack, which is also useless since every character except Misaki will usually kill an enemy in one hit. There's a revive spell if a party member dies... which will never happen. There are spells for removing conditions on party members, but even in the cases where a chracter is hit with an attack that imposes a condition, the enemy can still usually be taken out without having to deal with that.\n\nThe heal spells can be useful at rare occasions, usually at the beginning of the game. You can stock up on potions that do a lot of the same things as the spells, but you'll almost never need them. \n\nThere are two main stages in the game. In the first stage, you're in your home country. In the second stage, you chase the enemies to Japan. After you've bought all the most updated equipment in each stage, money becomes essentially useless.\n\nI accidentally stole a NPC's entire life savings by looking into a potted plant. It was only 2 gold. Made me feel kind of bad, but the game wouldn't let me give it back.\n\nThere was very little effort put into the game's story. I know it's an educational game, but it would have been nice if there was some effort to make it feel like the story wasn't just an excuse for learning. When you're directed to a new level, the directions are like, \"In order to continue our lessons, you must go to such-and-such village\" - why not even put some minimal effort into it and say something like, \"We've got a tip that weird stuff is happening in such-and-such village, we need to go chek it out!\"\n\nI know that's a small thing, but attention to details like that would have made the game feel more like a game.\n\nThe menu system was bulky and awkward. They could have very easily fit more hiragana options on one screen without the need to scroll. The way general options were set up was also very inefficient, often requiring a lot of back tracking and fiddling around to do what you want to do.\n\nOverall, though, I'd recommend this game because it teaches Hiragana well, and the RPG gameplay, while imperfect, was game-like enough that it distracted my mind from the tedium of studying.", "timestamp_created": 1493706754, "timestamp_updated": 1493844305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31476809": {"recommendationid": "31476809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123351840", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493602751}, "language": "english", "review": "it has both decent story and well done lesson structure (grinding is recomended for those who take japanese seriously)\nwith this and a few other third party apps on my phone i have now memorized the entire hiragana and katakana phonetics and if i can do it then anyone can!", "timestamp_created": 1493602917, "timestamp_updated": 1493602917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31475582": {"recommendationid": "31475582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143095523", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505363076}, "language": "english", "review": "Well I learn abit of fundamentals in Japanese before I played this, so the learning part is kinda boring for me.

at least in my opinion -  that the learning part is much more fun than the gaming part. \nyes, fighting the hiragana symbols by giving correct answers is a nice way to learn by repetition, but the rpg-part is at times too difficult and tedious. you never know how much health an enemy has- there are no hp-indicators. will one attack suffise or will you need more? will one strike instakill and the next attack on the same symbol be wasted? you just never know. initiative is unnerving and you often end up with half your team being hit or inconvenienced by effects like poisoning, sleep or paralysis, before you even had the chance to do some damage or counter the effects of the last round. you should constantly save the game because there is permadeath that throws you back to your last manual save and with battles as unpredictable as the ones in this game, the grim reaper always seems to lurk around the corner. one streak of badluck and your entire fellowship gets buggered with a fishfork. while the general controls are relatively intuitive and generally alright, inventory management and equipping are quite cumbersome.\n\nthese are things you will have to put up with between lessons. learning the symbols, vocabulary and writing is way more satisfying than going out into a ruinous labyrinth, fighting two battles and then having to head back to your base village to heal  and revive your little party over and over again. but then i am not a very rpg-o-phile person and others might be quite happy to endure all that.\n\nif you are stictly looking for a japanese-learning program, have no experience with old rpgs and no patience, keep away from this game. if you like to play oldschool rpgs like the early final fantasys and on top of that learn some basic japanese, then this will be perfect for you. i do hope they refine the next title and make the game part less disruptive and more adaptable to the players preferences.", "timestamp_created": 1492573409, "timestamp_updated": 1492573409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31213342": {"recommendationid": "31213342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069159152", "num_games_owned": 720, "num_reviews": 460, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492497329}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is... interesting.

Just don't worry too much about remembering the 'spelling' of the words being taught. \n\nIn terms of actual gameplay, it's a very simplistic jRPG style game, you can attack, guard, use items, cast defensive/buff spells and buy new equipment etc. Now to be clear, I hate old school turn based jRPGs, even classics like FF7/8 and Lost Odyssey eventually wore thin for me before I got to see the ending, but mercifully this game requires very little grinding in order to gear and level up your team to the point where they're fairly powerful (mine were about lvl 32 by completion on an ~12 hour playthrough, aided by the bonus levels gained through completing side quests). In fact the joy of it was I liked grinding because it was helping reinforce the Hirigana I was learning. \n\nI will echo some of the other reviews by saying that you do begin to see patterns of enemy formations rather than having to identify 3/4 random enemies each time, but this didn't diminish the value of the practice too much for me. \n\nFinally I will say that this is not the first time I have learnt the Hirigana, the first being a few years ago, so a completely fresh learner may have a slightly different experience. I was also supplementing the game with Heisig's Remember the Kana (or was it the other way round) which is vastly quicker but much less fun than playing through this short game!

It took me 21 hours to complete the game, which is long than most people who reviewed this game, because the game suggests you write everything in a notebook but instead I wrote every little detail in the Notes application on my iPhone and iPad using both Japanese keyboards which are included in the Settings application. \n\nI made two different pages in the Notes application which look a bit like grids because on one page I wrote the hiragana letters in one column, how to pronounce them in the next column, then the same hiragana letters with dakuten marks (\") or handakuten marks (o) in the next column and below those columns I wrote grammar particles such as \u306f, \u304c, \u3092, \u30d8, \u306e and \u3067\u3059which mean words like the, to, of, a, is and after learning all the hiragana letters this game also shows you how sentences, phrases or question are set up using these particles all of which I wrote down in Notes as well. The other page in my Notes application shows all the Japanese words I learnt throughout this game in hiragana letters one column, then in romaji (Latin/English letters) in the next column and then the English translation in the final column. If you have an iPhone or iPad or other smart device which you can easily access Japanese keyboards on I suggest writing down every little detail in a grid or table on an application like Notes the same as I have done. \n\nI am looking forward to playing the sequel Learn Japanese To Survive! Katakana War which I have also bought recently and am going to start now. If you want to learn kanji characters there is currently no game in this series for them but after I learnt all the hiragana letters from this game I decided to buy a Japanese language manga volume (specifically volume 1 of \u541b\u306e\u540d\u306f/Kimi no na wa/Your Name) and it nearly all has hiragana letters or kanji characters and next to each kanji character it shows you how to write it in hiragana letters too so I can just translate everything I don't know yet online by using hiragana letters and learn kanji characters at the same time (which I also write down in my Notes application) so this game was very useful for helping me read my manga too. If you can find a Japanese manga volume like mine with hiragana letters next to kanji characters I think it would be very useful after learning all the hiragana letters from this game to learn kanji too while waiting for a speculated sequel in the Learn Japanese to Survive for kanji characters.", "timestamp_created": 1491847869, "timestamp_updated": 1491847869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31063625": {"recommendationid": "31063625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101279099", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514102357}, "language": "schinese", "review": "By using my second lanugage to study Hiragana is a good idea for me,  since you can dig out more funs inside.", "timestamp_created": 1491844227, "timestamp_updated": 1491844227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31052106": {"recommendationid": "31052106", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056429450", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491786767}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u044f\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439. \u0423\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u0447\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0435\u0435, \u0447\u0435\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0435 \u0437\u0443\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435.", "timestamp_created": 1491787119, "timestamp_updated": 1491787119, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31041256": {"recommendationid": "31041256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061289185", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491820646}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00c9 um jeito bem divertido de aprender/memorizar Hiragana.

I love educational games, I feel like I have a ton of experience with them, and I considered Japanese an unlearnable subject for me, something that could only be learned with a really good educational game.\n\nTurns out this is an AMAZING educational game! After just the first set of characters, the simple vowels, I looked back on my notes and realized what I had done. I've written Japanese characters. Me! I did that! And I look at them and I understand their meaning! THIS IS INCREDIBLY EXCITING TO ME :D :D :D\n\nNow I've learned many characters and a few words and I'm starting to feel overwhelmed, but I won't stop being amazed at how much I've changed. I understand basically how Japanese works now, and I can hear the individual syllables in the words whereas before I heard nothing but gibberish! That's a huge accomplishment imo! My way of thinking has been irreversibly changed. And I don't think Japanese is that hard anymore. Well, not hiragana anyway xD There's still katakana and kanji to learn but those are entirely different subjects and games (and only this one and katakana are available right now). I'll probably pick up those sequels at some point because wow this style is effective!\n\nI'm not looking to be fluent or able to understand/hold a conversation with this. I'm just learning it casually, for fun. But even if I forget all the words I learn and how to read the characters, this breakthrough in my mind made it worth it. :D IM SO PROUD OF MYSELF!!!!!!!\n\nWhen the game [spoiler]gave me \u3059\u3057 and told me that I already know the word, I just have to sound it out using the syllables I learned, and I GOT IT IMMEDIATELY as \"sushi\",[/spoiler] my mind was blown. That's when I knew this was working, I've learned something. I'll never forget it. It was a moment of epiphany and enlightenment and overwhelming joy - the joy of discovery, of learning something new by figuring it out on my own. Something I've been sorely missing for a long time. That's the best way to learn, and that's what this game encourages. Sure it tells you to memorize all these characters and words and stuff, of course there needs to be memorization. But it doesn't feel so in-your-face and pressuring. It lets you do things in your own time, repeating as much as you need and just overall being gentle with the process. And it helps that it's an rpg with random battles where you have to attack with the correct meaning of the symbols, so it gives you the necessary repetition for memorizing but in a fun way. \n\nThe music, especially during lessons, is very soothing and relaxing. It helps to keep you stress free while you're trying to learn something as new and strange as Japanese. In fact, I find this game very relaxing as a whole mostly because of the music. I like to practice drawing the hiragana with a brush and ink along with the lesson music just to relax.\n\nI strongly recommend the game, especially if you want to learn Japanese but, like me, considered it too difficult or time consuming. Or if you want to have fun learning a new subject, it's good for that too since it is an educational game. :D", "timestamp_created": 1491432243, "timestamp_updated": 1491432243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30964431": {"recommendationid": "30964431", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975734585", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506769500}, "language": "german", "review": "Hiragana wars hat seinen Zweck absolut erf\u00fcllt. \nHauptziel des Spiels ist das Erlernen einer von drei japanischen Silbenschriften.\nHabe ohne jegliche Vorkenntnisse und mit nichts als meinem Notizbuch angefangen.\nNach Abschluss sollte man imstande sein alle Silben zu deuten. \n(Selbstverst\u00e4ndlich wird zum Entschl\u00fcsseln noch etwas Zeit ben\u00f6tigt und gelegentlich schleicht sich ein Fehler ein)\nWer allerdings eine gute Storyline oder ein deepes Spielprinzip erwartet hofft vergebens.\nDie hinterlegte Kampfmusik ist allerdings ganz nice und animiert zum Fortsetzen.\n\nWerde mir die Tage mal Katakana wars besorgen.", "timestamp_created": 1491410601, "timestamp_updated": 1491754603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30963100": {"recommendationid": "30963100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064336955", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491447779}, "language": "french", "review": "\u00c0 la fin du jeu, le joueur aura apris tous les caract\u00e8res hiragana.

The battles were just so slow and grindy for me (and I like RPG games) that I had to give myself the best armor so I wasn't spending a full minute \"fighting\" hiragana that I already knew. Without hacking my save, I'm not sure if I would have bothered finishing it.\n\nI should also point out that I fully realized this game was probably a mistake to buy like 5 minutes after playing 2 hours (which is past the refund limit). I would have refunded the game if I had kept better track of my time.\n\nA couple of my gripes with the game:\n\n\u2022 [b]Hiragana can inflict status ailments.[/b] So you enter a battle, immediately know the characters (you identify them to \"kill\" them)-- and then they put 3 of your 4 party members to sleep. Beyond that, the hiragana can all attack 1 party member, killing them in a single turn. Party members that are asleep or dead cannot be used to identify hiragana.\n\nAdditionally, [b]a hiragana character typically takes multiple times identifying it to kill it[/b], allowing it to keep attacking your party and inflicting status ailments. \n\nWhat does this all mean? Even if you know the material and wish to move on you have to spend more time than necessary trying to overcome the frustrating battle mechanics. The game element should take a back seat to the learning, not the other way around. \n\nIt came to a point where I would see the characters, say them out loud, and then run from the battle.\n\n\u2022 [b]Encounter rates are very high[/b] (take a few steps and be put into another battle), which loops back into my first point. \n\nAdditionally, you encounter pre-determined groups. By that I mean, characters aren't randomly thrown together before a battle-- you will encounter the same characters in the same groups over and over again. Meaning, you will recognize the group of characters (\"Oh, I just had this one last battle. Ji, Shi, Ko, Ku\"), rather than actually identifying the characters themselves. \n\n\u2022 During the \"lesson\" part of the game, words are introduced with characters you haven't even learned yet (which they write in romaji). This feels like a huge missed opportunity, as they could easily show you words made of characters you [i]have[/i] learned. \n\nFor example, imagine you've learned only the vowels. They then show you the word for chair (hiragana: \u300c\u3044\u3059\u300d) as \u300c\u3044su\u300d, rather than waiting until they teach the \"s\" group, and then introduced the full word. It just feels so pointless, and like such a missed opportunity. Learning words made of the characters you have learned is so rewarding, compared to half romaji/half hiragana words. (NOTE: That specific example does not show up in game, but many like it do). \n\n[b][u]\"So why do you recommend the game?!\"[/u][/b] you might be asking. As stated, this game [i]will[/i] help you learn the hiragana. The game does open up towards the very end, when it focuses more on words and phrases, as well as explaining sentence structures, which I enjoyed immensely. \n\nI will be purchasing [i]Katakana War[/i] because I do not know any of the katakana, so I'm sure my experience will be better. (On top of that, I've heard the dev addressed some of the issues with [i]Hiragana Battle[/i]). But again, if you do know a majority of the hiragana already, studying via traditional means will be far more rewarding, as well as less frustrating.\n\n[b][i]Edit:[/i][/b] I'm only a little bit into [i]Katakana War[/i] but it has already fixed most of my issues with [i]Hiragana Battle[/i].

This game does that wonderfully, with just the right amount of repetition, and is actually kinda fun if you're into RPG maker games! \n\nThe battle style is very simple: match the Hiragana to their sound in Romaji. It's very to the point, and not difficult.\nThe story is mediocre, but the story isn't the main point of the game, so I understand why it's so goofy.

It's a campy, light hearted, and simple plot but it's still there for texture. If you're trying to learn Hiragana, this will definately help recogize the characters. As far as learning how to speak Japanese, well, I'm pretty sure that's not really the primary focus, but you might pick up a couple vocabulary words along the way. I've learned a couple words, but mostly this is about Hiragana.\n\nWhat we have here is a simple twist to a classic style of turn based, RPG combat system where you have to answer the characters name/sound in order to damage them. Characters being introduced to the player/student are pretty much just stronger monsters, meaning you are going to have choose the correct name/sound of the same character more frequently in order to deplete all their HP. This means if you need a refresher on characters that don't show up in later dungeons, you can go back to earlier dungeons and one shot some of the weaker enemies, but only after you rediscover its sound/name. It's a pretty clever dynamic that loans itself quite well to its medium.\n\nThere seems to be a good mix enemy encounters, but a lot of the same arrangements of enemies repeat while others not so much. Having a limited vocabulary in Japanese, this is a bit of a concern for me.\n\nThe frequency of different characters appearing in the random battles may of may not be in response to how often one might see them in everyday Japanese conversation. For example, the letter 'E' is the most frequently used letter in our language. I'm not sure what the most commonly used Hiragana character is in the Japanese language. Hopefully, whatever it is is appearing the most frequently in the Japanese language is also appearing the most frequently in the random battles of the game. Is this a drawback? Ambiguously.\n\nOne thing you might want to do playing through this game is focus more on buying good armor. Not that the monsters are particulary difficult, but I find it helps you learn to not kill the Hiragana Warriors too quickly. Like I said, the combat system very much feels like using flash cards, and being able to use the same cards sooner, rather than later can be a big help for you. Omoshiroi, ne?\n\nUltimately, I think I'm getting my moneys worth here. It's an inexpensive game that can help you out quite a bit. It's not going to build a massive hype train, but it's definately one of the more fun ways of learning the lettering system of another language. I paid seven bucks for it, got 8 hours out of it, learned a couple things, and I still have more hours of gameplay to put into it. I looked at some of the other reviews, showing some people managed to get 13 hours and even 16 hours out of this for only $7.

I had tried using programs like The Rosetta Stone, but to be frank, it wasn't the type of teaching style that really stuck with me. Being able to learn via playing an RPG is brilliant! \n\nTo get as much as I could out of the game, I went out and purchased a note book and flash cards. I wrote down everything that I learned from the main lessons and the side quests. So far I've only made flash cards out of the Hiragana characters themselves, but I take them everywhere with me and just practice as much as possible. I highly suggest doing this as well, the only real way you're going to get a new language down is memorization via repitition. While the game is really good with that, it never hurts to continue doing you're own thing outside of the game.\n\nEven if, as a game, it's pretty basic, I wasn't in this for the gameplay. Even then it still kinda hurt a little how bland it was. It's a small gripe, but a gripe none-the-less. \n\nOverall, I'd recommend this to anyone that has trouble (or can't be assed) with traditional learning styles!

There are a few words and sentences thrown in there aswell, but don't expect it to be enough to hold a full conversation or read any manga (except maybe those aimed at children?)\n\n2) The game does teach you how to write the characters, but it has no mechanics to reinforce it. Unless you actively work on writing the letters yourself, you're likely to only recognize the letters when shown, and not to actually be able to write them. A writing mechanic could greatly improve this (though you'd probably need a tablet to use that effectively). \n\n3) The game could do with some more repetition. The characters you learn are usually only shown in one particular area. Once you're past that area, you may not come across them ever again untill the last dungeon. This makes it very likely you'll forget at least some of them. Introducing words in battle sooner or a new game + mode where every character can be found in battle in every area might help here. \n\nThat said, the game does a much better job in teaching a foreign language than I've ever seen in schools, even if it's only a starting point.

The game does a decent job at teaching Hiragana, thought it lacks in other areas.\n\nThe game attempts to teach the player the Hiragana form of Japanese writing, which is said by the game to be the most basic form of Japanese writing and that almost all forms of sentences can be written from it.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe gameplay teaches Hiragana by presenting you with lessons and then adding the content of the lesson into battles. The battles play out in normal JRPG style, but the enemies are Hiragana characters you have learned. In order to damage them you must know what they mean. \n\nThe gameplay is by no means complex. The combat is simple, and most of the gameplay aspects follow suit. However this isn\u2019t that big of a deal; Hiragana Battle is a game about learning Hiragana, not about tactical turn based combat. \n\nStory:\n\nThe overarching story is pretty clich\u00e9. Wizard wants power. Wizard tries to get power. Heroes decide to kill wizard. So on. So forth. Perfectly acceptable seeing what the actual goal was.\n\nThe characters aren\u2019t very engaging.  I found myself forgetting their names not seconds after I met them.  That\u2019s fine though; the characters are intended to ease the pain of learning a whole other language, not to grip you with a harrowing tale of wizard fighting.\n\nI came to observe the game from a designer perspective and to have some fun learning something new. Some philosophical meaning behind the story would fog up the real point of the game. The point is to learn Hiragana. Everything else is servile to that end. \n\n\nEducation:\n\nI can\u2019t speak on the accuracy of what I\u2019m learning. This is the first time I have ever heard of the term Hiragana; much less that Hiragana is one of three writing styles in Japan. I have to take it on faith that these people know what they are doing. I hope that my faith is well placed, which by the majority of reviews it seems it is. \n\nBefore I delve in, you need a pen and paper, no joke. Unless you plan to communicate with a single Hiragana vowel, at the risk of sounding like a caveman emerging from Mount Fuji, you might want to write this stuff down. Class in session!\nThe developers made it pretty hard to screw up learning Hiragana. They give you the sound of the letter or phrase, the English equivalent, an animation on how to write it with the exact order of the strokes, and they give you a study-guide that you can fall back on if you are a bit rusty or don\u2019t remember something. They got their bases covered which adds credibility and makes it far easier to learn.\n\nThis being said, the game does ask that you actually study Hiragana on your own time. This is the only way you\u2019re going to learn this stuff. Yes, you can make a cheat sheet and just look off that, but that negates the whole game. If you want a story driven JRPG, I respectfully point you to the Final Fantasy series. Hiragana Battle is a JRPG, but in reality it is a game about learning Hiragana, so if you are looking for story and gameplay alone Hiragana Battle might not fill that gap.\n\nI am a tad bit dubious as to what extent can you actually take what they teach you. I consider this as an introduction to the language, but I\u2019m not really in the position to say. As I stated earlier this is my most basic exposure to this stuff.\n\nIn Total:\n\nThe game does what it sets out to do. Teach people Hiragana. Not only does it succeed, it got positive reception too. Hard to get positive reviews when making a game that teaches anything, much less something as complex and as vast as a language.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who want to give a well-executed educational game a try, people who want to try and learn Hiragana, and most of all, game developers. Yes, game developers. A lot can be learned from this game in terms of teaching through gamification, and I would love to see a wave of awesome educational games that I can have fun playing while also expanding my mind (even if it\u2019s just a bit). \n\nI would give Hiragana Battle a 7/10. The details of the lessons really shine through when learning Hiragana. The story and combat leaves something to be desired, but is more than adequate to keep the player entertained while they learn.\n", "timestamp_created": 1484784460, "timestamp_updated": 1484784460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29319861": {"recommendationid": "29319861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094285574", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484061411}, "language": "english", "review": "Doesn't teach \u3091 and \u3090[spoiler] which are only used historically and serve no purpose nowadays anyway\t[/spoiler].

I did Latin and German back in middle school and high school, al those classes really did was let me know that I have something of an aptitude for languages. However, this is the first time I've had to learn a whole new set of characters, German and Latin both use the Roman Alphabet that English uses, so it was a simple matter of learning spelling, pronunciation, and meaning. This integrates both the spoken and written language into one seamless leasson. You learn what the character looks like, how to properly draw it, the sound, or syllable, it represents, and how to properly pronounce it, all in one easy to understand package.\n\nMy one caveat is this. When you take notes, pay attention to the dialogue box for the easiest way to draw the chacter, then watch teh animation to learn the proper stroke order. The animation assumes that you're using a caligraphy pen, and often looks very different from how the character is commonly written, diffent even from what is shown in the dialogue boxes.\n\nOverall, I would say that this is an excellent method for teaching any subject, turn it into a game that rewards study, repitition, and persistence. I would recomend this to anyone who has ever had even a passing interest in learning Japanese, and I wish the creators would make more like this.

That said, this title is well worth full price, I bought it on a whim during a sale.  It teachers you the Hiragana alphabet while being a very enjoyable RPG.  However, I will say you should treat this title as a supplement instead of an end all be all, just as anything else you would when you are learning something new.\n\nHiragana Battle does exactly what it promises and then some.  I learned and committed the alphabet to memory through light grinding and a few online resources.  The explanations for how to write the characters, while not too involved, were more than enough for me to follow and understand.  As you play, the game provides you with plenty of vocabulary, and even touches on sentence structure.  I don't claim to be fluent, but I did spot a few inconsistencies with my other learning resources, but for the most part everything agreed with whatever I researched.\n\nThe story itself is no Witcher, but a nostalgic callback to simpler JRPGs in the vein of say, Dragon Quest.  Simplistic turn based combat and spells are in your arsenal, though not at all required to complete the game.  Boss battles are not difficult at all, but then again I grinded a bit during each area to make sure I knew what characters were what before moving on.  It's a learning game first after all.\n\nI want to give a special note to the soundtrack, it definitely helped the light slog because the songs are all very good.  I can't think of one that I didn't like.\n\nAll in all, if you want to learn Japanese, or at least begin to, this is a great place to start.  You still have to study, you still have to set aside time, and you still have to commit, but at least here you'll enjoy yourself while you learn.

Selecting the wrong answer will do no damage, forcing you to learn the hiragana in order to advance (or, if you're lazy, you can keep guessing and hope your party isn't defeated).

I've always wanted to learn a second language, namely Japanese, but when it came to youtube or document-based tutorials, I just couldn't get engaged. It seemed futile, but on a whim (and during the Christmas sale) I found this unassuming little gem for just over a dollar. What could I possibly gain from buying it?\n\nI've only been playing for three days now, but within that time, I've learned 25 different Hiragana characters, can say at least 10 sentences and I know some handy greetings. For example, I didn't actually know 'karaoke' was Japanese, and there's even a language system known as Katakana that's specifically for representing foreign words. I'm currently on lesson 3 but it's already given me a ton to process.\n\nYou need the temperament and attitude of wanting to learn Japanese. Of course, there's a game underneath and it totally services what it was built for, but \"Learn Japanese To Survive! Hiragana Battle\" is really a thiny-veiled second language course and that's how it needs to be treated. I was surprised when the game asked to take notes, but believe me, this is an extremely essential part of the game and you'll want to write down every single thing it says, including practicing how to write the characters, memorizing them and any other memetic trick or habit you can think of. Writing down vowels in Hiragana for the first time was pretty difficult, but after doing it a lot, it became really easy; it's clear that learning this stuff is designed to rewire your brain, and you're not gonna get that unless you actually write these things down. It'll be even worse when you're actually fighting against the \"Hiragana warriors\" because you're guaranteed to forget some of this stuff.\n\nPlaying this game taught me that I don't really learn well unless I'm in some kind of classroom environment. Cherry picking things off of Youtube or random tutorial sites is bound to fail me because, unlike this game, it lacks the necessary components of learning, which is feeling engaged, interested, focused and rewarded. I dunno if any of you are like this or not, but if you are, I highly recommend picking this up, whether it's on sale or not.\n", "timestamp_created": 1483126709, "timestamp_updated": 1483126709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28833398": {"recommendationid": "28833398", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098781603", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483018932}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good for revising some simple hiragana and some phrases in Japanese.. pretty worth the 3 bucks for a simple 8 bit game.", "timestamp_created": 1483114235, "timestamp_updated": 1483114235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28815452": {"recommendationid": "28815452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055070358", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483070819}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game.\nFor me this was a refresher and more since the last time I learned hirgana was 10 years ago.\nI feel this is a really good way to learn hirgana because it is interactive and fun rather than learning straight out of a text book.

It made education surprisingly fun, at least for the first while, after which it became somewhat monotonous mechanically, but remained a solid learning resource nonetheless. It also encourages pretty decent study habits, which, admittedly, many people seem to lack. I'd highly recommend it so long as you fulfill one simple criteria:\n\nYou have to want to actually learn.\n\nSimply put, learning a language or well.. anything takes a lot of time. You can certainly learn to understand each individual hiragana and to sound out words with what this game provides, but you have to be willing to put forth the effort. Writing things down when the lessons prompt you to is practically a must for anything to progress in a timely matter. The educational structure of this game presents you with 5 hiragana each time, starting with your basic vowels and leading into consonants and modifiers (dakuten) and the like. It's paced well enough that you can get a solid grip on the 5 most recent hiragana that you were shown before having more characters forced upon you. If you want to practice, you can always traditionally grind mobs in certain areas corresponding to the hiragana set you're looking to practice.\n\nAs far as the actual game's mechanics outside of the basic education it provides, it's mediocre at best. The story is expectedly clich\u00e9, the characters are your standard affair for mediocre RPGMaker-esque games, and the writing is most definitely nothing to write home about. If you're buying this for the actual gameplay, you're looking at the wrong game. This is solely a means to educate you with progressing through the game being your incentive. It's effectively chasing a carrot on a stick, you just have to want the carrot.\n\nThe controls are fairly standard affair but are pretty clunky if you opt to use mouse only, but that's really my only gripe regarding functionality.\n\nAll in all, for someone looking to learn hiragana who thinks the concept of incentivized learning in an RPG format is appealing, by all means, you don't want to pass this up.

Unfortunately it only goes so far. One might think they are only learning Hiragana though & I can at least say there is a fair amount of grammer & vocabulary that is taught as well. They have already announced another game for katakana, so I'm hopeful they will be able to move on to some kanji for something more around my level.\n\nThe battle game challenge is a bit intense if you don't grind as it intends you to do since each battle is mini review. I didn't die once in this game, but there were many times when it was close. In fact, pretty much every encounter was me being close to death with each turn. And since many things had higher speed with my first encounters with them, they would get some hard hits in regardless of my own skill. I think the balance would work better if there were 3 characters, but each took more around 1/3rd damage instead of a full 1/2+ if one were a bit underleveled.\n\nYou're allowed to run at 100% success rate with no penalty. I think I like this, but of course with my preferences these days it wouldn't be a problem if the encounters were visible before doing an encounter and there were ways to avoid the enemies. I'm not sure these devs are skilled or financially independent enough to go through with all that anyways. As it stands with random encounters, having an easy escape tool is good enough for a learning tool, I suppose.\n\nThe story is mildly comedic, which I think is a fine approach. I think it was kind of a lost opportunity though much of the story's events being all too brief. They could have fleshed out the characters, setting & added funnier jokes in some of the text & events that feel more like filler. Granted a game like this is designed to be padded, but it feels they didn't pad it out with much other than the battles and all the 'puzzles' that basically give the run around.\n\nIt's still a solid study tool sans actual writing.

An evil wizard and his Hiragana warriors destroys your hometown, and you then set out on a journey to defeat him by learning Hiragana yourself. It's cliche and it doesn't set the game apart at all, but it does give an explaination to why you're learning Hiragana.\n\nThe characters and dialogue isn't too special either. There are some attempts to give the characters a personality and some attempts at humor, but it all blends into one and another.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe gameplay reflects the idea of learning Hiragana, by having to use the skill which corresponds to the Hiragana character in order to damage it. It's easy and simple, and it works well in the early part of the game. Later on, when you learn more Hiragan, you end up with a list of over 50 skills. It gets more complex in terms of the Hiragana you have to keep track of, but there isn't much progression in the gameplay itself. The list of skills end up becoming one big mess which is tedious to scroll through, and it's pretty much about using the correct skill over and over again.\n\nWith a great game concept like this, I really wish the developer would have dragged all the creativity further to strenghten the gameplay. It would have done so much to see some progression in the gameplay, by for example having to chain different answers together to defeat words for example.\n\nI also found the equipment and levels to be unneccessary. The game would have worked just as great if every Hiragana character was killed by one correct answer, and by only damaging the player if the wrong answer is given. The game pulls in these unneccessary JRPG elements which doesn't add anything to the game, and it hurts the gameplay.\n\n[b]Graphics & Audio[/b]\nThe graphicsis pretty much like what you expect from most RPG Maker games. It's not bad, but it doesn't set the game apart or give it an individual artistic look. The audio mostly consists of some generic background music, as well as sound effects of pronounciation of Hiragana characters and words. \n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nFor $2.99 (on sale), I got a very creative game concept with mediocre execution, as well as learning Hiragana. I would love to see similiar games (Katakana Battle, for example), which takes the same concept and push it even further by refining the gameplay and artistic identity, because I feel like Hiragana battle is mostly a rough concept sent through the RPG Maker factory at this point. I still recommend it if you're interested in learning Hiragana though.", "timestamp_created": 1480347324, "timestamp_updated": 1480347528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27924705": {"recommendationid": "27924705", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155326377", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502377543}, "language": "english", "review": "Great, easy and entertaining teaching tool.", "timestamp_created": 1480318615, "timestamp_updated": 1480318615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27917172": {"recommendationid": "27917172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343630589", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480277892}, "language": "english", "review": "I like it, waiting for the Katakana version to be released.", "timestamp_created": 1480309563, "timestamp_updated": 1480309563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27913519": {"recommendationid": "27913519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043635410", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480307855}, "language": "english", "review": "I never thought I would try to learn Japanese, but this game makes it seem possible.

If I were to rate this as a game alone, I could not give my recommendation to buy.  \n\nBut looking at this as an educational tool, you couldn't find a better (or cheaper) tool to teach yourself Hiragana.  It really isn't a replacement for a college course in Japanese, with a competent teacher; but it will be a useful tool for the memorization of these symbols.  The game was obviously made in your average RPGMaker, and the story is corny and mediocre.  But as an educational tool for beginners and a descent way to practice for intermediate speakers, I can give my recomendationto buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1476546633, "timestamp_updated": 1476546633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26041113": {"recommendationid": "26041113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127404942", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476515964}, "language": "english", "review": "ye.", "timestamp_created": 1476501940, "timestamp_updated": 1476501940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.426878", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26035990": {"recommendationid": "26035990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002901366", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476478173}, "language": "english", "review": "I can not recomend this, i wish i could, i like the concept but it is way too rudimentary, there are a lot of issues and a the interface just stinks... \n\n(sorry if something is spelled wrong, english is not my mother language)", "timestamp_created": 1476477513, "timestamp_updated": 1476477513, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.415704", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26031790": {"recommendationid": "26031790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181798338", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476462673}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Learn Japanese To Survive!\" or the name I gave it: \"How to be a better weeb's guide!\"\nToo lazy to learn moon runes by yourself?

As a game, this is really bad. The story is some nonsense about a Japanese mage invading the world, or whatever. Who cares. The controls are simple, the graphics bad, the sound bad and so on. If you want a good JRPG, this isn't it.\n\nWhat this is, however, is a great way to get an introduction in Japanese. That mage I mentioned has a whole army of, uh, letters at his disposal, and the only way to beat them is to match the Japanese letters with the English ones. For instance, if the symbol for \"ka\" pops up, you need to pick \"Answer\", then select what you (think) the letter means. If you pick \"ka\", the enemy takes damage. If you pick anything else, the enemy won't. While this sound simple, keep in mind they usually attack in groups of two or three, and they really like to vary things around. So even if you are on your third \"lesson\" with the latest five symbols, you will still find the first symbols in the random battles you encounter. But this means that for once, grinding is a lot of fun. You are constantly getting symbols thrown you that you haven't seen in a while, so you really need to learn what they mean to proceed. (that's one reason why the game suggests you keep a notebook. Don't use it a a cheat-sheet (you won't learn anything that way), but it can be quite handy as reference.)\n\nNow here's the best part: When I started this, I didn't have a clue about what each symbol was. It's just a lot of nonsense to me. But after ony two hours of playing, I have a pretty decent understanding what 15 of these symbols mean, and many of them can \"transform\" into other symbols by adding a \" at the end. So the more you play, the more you learn. Of course, it's not like you're going to be fluid in Japanese after playing this game. Not by a long shot. But the game WILL teach you enough to give you a good starting point. Once you've mastered the basics by playing this game, you can move on to more advanced stuff. Read Japanese comic books. Play your favorite game with Japenese texts. Visit a Japnese forum.\n\nSo to make the mandatory too long, didn't read:\n\nAs a game, it's terrible.\n\nAs a way to learn Japanese, it's fun, cheap and pretty darn good.

This is a great studying tool to learn the Hiragana alphabet as well as a limited range of vocabulary including the Hiragana you learn. For the price mark of $6,99, it might deter some people. I would love if the price was lower for such a small learning tool, but if you like learning through games, I would definitely consider buying this.\n\nThe battles are simple: match the romaji to the correct Hiragana to damage it.\n\nPersonal Pros:\nFirst starting the game, the learning was not intimidating at all. It goes through pronunciation and strokes to properly write the Hiragana. From there, it gives you time to reinforce the Hiragana you've learned by progressing through a stage. Having to memorize which hiragana corresponds to which translation effectively helps me. Another thing that was helpful was the \"Ghoul Ruins\" stage, where the battles are flipped. You have to match the right Hiragana to the correct romaji to fight. Learning in that type of reversal is also beneficial. Also, what I appreciate, is that equipment and items in the late game start to change into Hiragana format, so that in order to read them, you must have properly understood what you have been learning so far. Conversations and words in the late game will also include Hiragana, most of which are phrases that you have become acquainted with already to use. Lastly, it's a game. You're going to have a little fun while you're learning stuff. That's the best way to learn stuff, at least for me.\n\nSummary:\n- Nice learning progression\n- Good reinforcement through battles\n- Transition into medium use of hiragana later\n- It's a game, you'll have fun while learning\n\nPersonal Cons:\nThe enemies seem to have a sort of format. Example: This random encounter will only include a certain 3 or 4 Hiragana, so it's easy to memorize which Hiragana is used to defeat a certain battle. Also, most stages only contain the newest set of Hiragana learned at the time. I would have really loved if all stages jumbled up the Hiragana you've learned so far to truly test if you remember everything from beginning to end. Or even if there was a hidden stage in the last game to practice matching the Hiragana to the romaji counterpart instead. In addition, the newest hiragana you fight every time might be too difficult to fight (you might get smashed by their latest attacks), so you could find yourself farming levels and practicing only a certain set of Hiragana to catch up, which sucks because you want to move on and equally spend time practicing everything else. A small con that really made me sad: the menu navigation. When you scroll down to the bottom, I REALLY wish it would reset and start again from the top. It would help with selecting answers during fights so much.\n\nSummary: \n- Fixed Hiragana battles and enemy encounters\n- New stages only practice the latest Hiragana set learned\n- More time must be spent in a certain area to catch up on levels, therefore more time is invested into a certain set of Hiragana, not everything else as a whole\n- THE MENU NAVIGATION ;_;\n\nSo far, I'm pretty much right before the boss. This has been a great study tool just for the Hiragana. Every time I go into a battle, I make sure to write down what Hiragana I am up against to practice the strokes, and if I plan on escaping the battle (which I tend to do if I'm way far ahead of the stage), I make sure I am aware of which Hiragana is which. Definitely enjoyable, but just make sure that you are aware that this is a learning TOOL, not an actual game to learn a huge portion of Japanese. Also, if you are interested, but the price deters you, just check out some free apps out there to help get you started on Hiragana instead.\n\nOverall? 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1475494702, "timestamp_updated": 1475605184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25832427": {"recommendationid": "25832427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254487558", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475462824}, "language": "english", "review": "Finished learning Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji to go.

So no immediate punishment for bad choices and learning is not very efficient.  Also there's too much wandering around to get to the next battle.  This is an okay introduction, but it is not designed with optimizing learning in mind - which is a shame because it would only take a few tweaks to the gameplay to make it much better.  Bigger enemy armies, and a snappier UI with fewer answers to choose from would help.\n\nAlso in the battle phases there could have been reinforcement of the phonetics associated with the symbols, maybe as a symbol died.  So the game is mostly learning the shapes of all the Hiragana characters, but I don't feel like I'm getting hardly any practice with the sounds these characters make.

I am still waiting. I have been trying for a couple hours now to like this game but I cannot. This review is for two purposes: (1) If you sincerely want to learn Japanese, please take the following into consideration before you buy, and (2) If you are a dev of educational games, here are some things NOT to do. I know I'm going to come across as a mansplainer so you're warned...\n\nWhy is this an RPG? At first I was excited by the idea that we could learn Japanese (or even just Hiragana) via an RPG system... however, the mechanics of this system do not complement or facilitate learning. At best, they get in the way, and at worst, they really make it hard to want to learn. In order to attack, you have to first select \"Answer,\" then select the correct Hiragana - and by mid-game (as far as I got before throwing in the towel) this is a looooooooong list, then select the correct Hiragana warrior to attack. Pick the wrong answer and you do no damage. This is supposed to reinforce memorization of the Hiragana, right? Wrong. It turns out that this game is made in RPG Maker and no changes were made to the battle system... so there are fixed, pre-determined groups of Hiragana, usually only 2 or 3 possible combinations per world. I quickly memorized the pattern of enemies and was not anymore concentrating on the Hiragana, but the system of button presses that would result in my victory the quickest. Plus, because the Hiragana are never (well, except the alternate dimension part) written into your menu, I was instead memorizing English letters! I doubt the devs intended this but it is a severe oversight.\n\nThis type of gameplay mistake persists in almost every area. I suspect it is for a noble cause. The devs are likely very, very passionate about teaching, or at least they like the Japanese language. There isn't much on the market for teaching language that isn't insanely boring or difficult. So, they wanted to make learning into an RPG... but I suspect the devs aren't practiced game designers, so they just downloaded RPG Maker and crammed the Japanese language into the program's way of doing things. This game should have been made in a more flexible system like Unity or Unreal, or coded from the ground up. The mechanics of the game should have been 100% about the mechanics of the Japanese language. Unfortunately we end up with the following:\n\nEXCUSE PLOT INTERFERES WITH LEARNING. I know it's educational so the plot \"doesn't matter.\" Either ditch it or figure out how to work it into learning. Having to walk back and forth across a room to find a key feels like grinding. If I liked grinding I would learn the old-fashioned way.\n\nGRIND. Ideally when you learn a new set of Hiragana you would get a chance to RAPIDLY test your skills. Instead you are given a quiz of 5 questions (seriously? this is the worst part of the game imho) that can be brute forced, then sent out to battle. Each battle is excruciatingly long. Hiragana take multiple hits to defeat, they inflict statuses (why? what point is there to standard RPG mechanics?), they do insane damage to you, and random battles happen every 6 steps or so. If grind is the only way to learn, download a Hiragana chart and do it for free.\n\nPRONUNCIATION IS GIVEN BY ROBOTS. I can't say for sure but I think the sound files for pronunciation are only the 50 or so syllables in Japanese glued together. It sounds okay for the individual Hiragana but very forced when learning the vocabulary. Full sentences sound like Google Translate. I may be a beginner in Japanese but I am confident no one speaks like that. For the love of God just talk into a microphone - there aren't that many vocab words in the game.\n\nWHY LEARN VOCABULARY? The vocab sections are not mechanically a part of the game. Again, I'm playing this to learn the language in a more immersive and enjoyable environment than a classroom. If I'm sitting here listening to someone recite (robotically) 10 words that I have to memorize, I'm going to go elsewhere for learning. Especially if I am not required to use those words ANYWHERE, and they serve no purpose mechanically. Oh, and the vocab words I got through don't actually help you create sentences.\n\nLESSONS AND GAMEPLAY NOT INTEGRATED. The whole point of the educational game is that I learn while I play. I felt the learning was separate - in lessons made before each world, asking you to write and take notes on a separate sheet of paper. Why play the game, then, and not just look at a chart or take a class?\n\nART STYLE DISTRACTING. This one's more personal, but the music/sound/art felt totally wrong. I'm squarely blaming RPG Maker for this one because the devs are working with it pretty much out-of-the-box. But future edutainment devs should note that using an out-of-the-box program results in a stale, uninspiring game.\n\nALL THAT SAID! If you want to learn Hiragana, you can with this game. But you won't really learn any useful Japanese, you won't get the pronunciation right, you won't learn Katakana or Kanji, AND it will take you considerably longer than if you just spend five minutes a day looking at a chart of Kana and writing them down.\n\nLong review, I know, but I really, really, REEEEEEEALLY wanted to like this. I want edutainment to be a thing not just in schools, but everywhere. I'm also trying to learn Japanese right now. So I jumped at the chance. But ultimately it looks like we're still waiting for the perfect game.

With Japanese being so different to english, I wasn't able to figure out much of what was being presented, and gave up quickly.\n\nThen I found Hiragana Battle. I flew through the game in a weekend, and gathered up the motivation to give Rosetta Stone another try. This time it went much easier. Having a basic understanding of what the language is built out of, and being able to sound out the written portions made the initial lessons much less overwhelming.

Et apprendre \u00e7a dans son coin, c'est possible, mais c'est parfois dur de s'y mettre.\n\nDonc l\u00e0, on me propose une m\u00e9thode RPG-esque pour apprendre une partie des caract\u00e8res japonais : les Hiraganas. C'est en promo, et je me dis : \"pourquoi pas ?\". Apr\u00e8s tout, quel gamer fan de RPG n'a pas pass\u00e9 des heures \u00e0 faire du level up pour d\u00e9bloquer telle ou telle comp\u00e9tence, ou tout simplement pour poutrer tout ce qui bouge avec force et fracas ? Et ben autant passer quelques heures pour faire ce que je fais souvent, les Hiraganas en plus.\n\nJ'irai donc droit au but : \u00e7a marche ! C'\u00e9tait tout b\u00eate, mais fallait y penser.\nPour ceux qui voudraient des pr\u00e9cisions sur le fonctionnement de Hiragana Battle, en gros :\n\n1) Notre sensei nous apprend une nouvelle le\u00e7on pour massacrer les Hiraganas Warriors de la zone Y. Ces le\u00e7ons sont organis\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re logique (par sons), tranquillement. En gros, 5 nouveaux caract\u00e8res \u00e0 chaque fois, voire plus s'il y a utilisation de dakuten ou de handakuten. Ce sont juste des petits signes qui sont rajout\u00e9s pour modifier les sons. Exemple tout simple : [ku] \u304f se transforme en [gu] \u3050 juste en lui ajoutant un dakuten. Le signe en lui-m\u00eame reste le m\u00eame, donc \u00e7a reste tr\u00e8s simple une fois qu'on a compris le principe.\n\n2) On part dans la zone Y pour appliquer la le\u00e7on : je vois \u304b qui me regarde d'un air vicieux ? Ben je choisis sa traduction [ka] pour lui apprendre qui est le patron.\n\n3) Retour en ville, le\u00e7on suivante, et rebelote. Parfois, des le\u00e7ons de vocabulaire sur les mots de base sont rajout\u00e9es, histoire de changer un peu. Idem via quelques (rares) sidequests.\n\n4) A partir d'un certain moment dans le jeu, le principe d'inverse : vous allez voir [no] se balader, et il faudra retrouver \u306e pour lui rappeler combien la vie peut \u00eatre difficile. Dommage d'ailleurs que cette \u00e9tape ne soit pas plus pr\u00e9sente, parce que c'est bien plus difficile dans ce sens-l\u00e0 que dans l'autre !\n\nEt donc, \u00e7a fonctionne : je ne sais plus exactement \u00e0 combien d'heures j'en suis, mais en s'appliquant, en un peu plus de 10h, on est capables de lire \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s tous les Hiraganas sans trop de probl\u00e8me (m\u00eame s'il y en a certains se ressemblent beaucoup, ce qui pr\u00eate \u00e0 confusion). Au niveau du ryhtme, une petite heure par jour + relecture des notes le soir, et c'est bon !\n\nAttention cependant :\n- Sans carnet sur lequel noter les Hiraganas au fur et \u00e0 mesure, c'est m\u00eame pas la peine.\n- Les Hiraganas sont r\u00e9partis dans une logique zone/son : c'est tr\u00e8s pratique au d\u00e9but, mais du coup vers la fin, on ne revoit plus forc\u00e9ment ceux des le\u00e7ons pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, ce qui n'aide pas \u00e0 les m\u00e9moriser. De m\u00eame, les s\u00e9ries d'Hiraganas sont al\u00e9atoires... mais c'est souvent les m\u00eames qui reviennent, donc on s'entraine sur certains plus que sur d'autres.\n- Ne comptez pas apprendre le japonais avec ce jeu. L\u00e0, on se retrouve comme quand on \u00e9tait minot en maternelle \u00e0 apprendre ces trucs bizarres qu'on appelle des lettres, et c'est tout, ou presque !\n- Vers la fin du jeu, on se rend compte qu'il n'est pas suffisant pour permettre de continuer \u00e0 s'am\u00e9liorer (en automatisation et en vitesse de d\u00e9codage notamment). Il faut alors basculer sur autre chose.\n- D'ailleurs, \u00e9vitez de frimer une fois le jeu termin\u00e9 : non, vous ne pourrez pas tout d\u00e9coder m\u00eame si vous avez appris par coeur tous les Hiraganas. Prendre un texte au hasard vous calmera de suite, parce que sans les Katakanas, on se retrouve vite bloqu\u00e9. Heureusement, la suite (avec les Katakanas donc) est \u00e9galement disponible.\n- Il manque clairement un vrai post-game pour continuer \u00e0 v\u00e9ritablement s'entrainer.\n\nMalgr\u00e9 ces b\u00e9mols, Hiragana Battle est un \"jeu\" qui remplit parfaitement son office : aider \u00e0 apprendre les Hiraganas.

This game can be extremely frustrating if you have prior knowledge; the more you know the more you will be annoyed. \n\nMost of the impatience comes from RPGmaker, however, as this is bare-bones as RPGs come. This coupled with the aggravating UI (you have to scroll through an ever-growing list of all the Romaji syllables to make a selection) makes it more of a chore than it should be. I digress...\n\nI haven't completed it yet, and I'm not certain if I will. As it is, this game is a great introduction to learning Hiragana. It is paced out well enough, and the lessons are simple to learn. I cannot fault the game for what it does, because it does it quite well. This game WILL make you remember the Hiragana characters, as promised, but in the most aggravating way imaginable. \n\nAn RPG where you fight enemy characters (literally) by matching them with the corresponding Romaji. Seems simple enough, but the rate of random encounters in this game is obscene. Areas that take 30sec to walk through can take up to 30 minutes because of all the battle sequences. After finishing an encounter, you cannot walk for even 10 seconds until the next one starts, which is infuriating. In a game depending on classic RPGmaker level design (ie. crude mazes), the player HAS to walk around somewhat unimpeded to complete the level. This is impossible in this game.\n\nSince you won't fight more than a few characters in each battle, you will be seeing the same 5 syllables pop up in every zone (for example, the first zone consists of 30+ encounters with only 5 \"S\" characters). You only memorize a small chunk of Hiragana at a time, while completely ignoring those that were previously learned. If I did not already know my Hiragana, this would almost definitely lead me to forget the early lessons. \n\nThe small bits of vocabulary you learn are a nice addition, but is definitely not a focus or even really a selling point. Apparently you fight full words by the end levels, so I'm going to try and stick around until then.\n\nTL;DR: This game will make you memorize Hiragana in the most annoying way possible, but it is effective.

The game itself is your simple turn-based RPG with a leveling system and the plot isn't terribly rich, but it's entertaining enough to spend hours learning Japanese with.\n\nIn Hiragana Battle, you will learn all 46 characters of the Hiragana character set (and its dakuten and handakuten variants) and a bunch of words from yes/no to household items and a few simple phrases, along with their Romanized (Romaji) variants to make it easier to understand the pronounciation as an English speaker. The Hiragana character set is surprisingly easy to get a hold of, taking about 14 hours of gameplay to learn, however I still find myself going back through and still having to look at my notes (which I very much recommend you do, especially on paper and pencil), so the memorization definitely takes time. My best suggestion is to do a single or two chapters a day, then grind out for a good couple days until you don't need your notes to defeat all the enemies, and then move on. I made the mistake of going through and just jumping to my notes when I found myself stumped.\n\nThe game gave plentiful information to understand how the Hiragana set is written and pronounced, and gave many examples of words and a few phrases, but it didn't feel satisfying enough [strike]because it just wasn't enough i must learn all the japanese and become the most weeb[/strike] because the game gives very minimal examples for conversation pieces, but it's permissible since its purpose is more-or-less get you hooked and researching afterwards.\n\ntl;dr: I give it an 8.5 out of 10; It's a very great way to get into the Japanese Language and learn a bit of it, but it doesn't have enough content to fully replace what a class/your own research would do. I very excitedly await the release of Katakana War, and hopefully a sequel after that for Kanji. It and Hiragana Battle will be worth the $6.99 each. I almost wish I didn't get it on a Summer Sale Price so I could pay full-price for this.\n\n\u3042\u308a\u304b\u309b\u3068\u3046\u3053\u309b\u3055\u309b\u3044\u307e\u3059!\n\n(Now to invest in a mini-keyboard with a Japanese character set.

It has a nice story, very catchy music and in my opinion it's a good way to introduce one to Hiragana by fighting hiragana warriors with romajis.

In addition you'll also learn some useful words and phrases (, which you should note down as well as the syllabaries!) You can learn Hiragana even more effectively if you learn the syllables, words, etc. privately by your own. So, you'll always be prepared for each fight.\nThere was a point in the game where I felt like fighting for nothing because the fights got a bit repetetive, but I guess that's because I'm not a big fan of rpgs and aren't experienced enough with them.

It's incredibly useful. It's always bothered me that I'm not fluent in another language. This game has paved the way for change. I'm now fluent in HIragana. It really only takes...I don't know, 10 hours? After that you'lll have a pretty good grasp of the language.  At about 20 hours I was extremely confident. Along with this game, I downloaded an app. from the Google store  to study Hiragana on train rides to and from work. It seems to have done the trick.\n\nWhile this game is amazing, I wish they would've taken it even further. But for what it is, and the price it's at, the game does a great job of teaching you. Here are some improvements that could be made:\n\n- Battles focused on writing. I can read the characters, but even after playing this game I struggle with writing from memory. I kept thinking how cool it would be if this game offered some Zelda/Okami style puzzle system integrated with teaching the player how to write.\n\n- Pronunciation. Maybe have some battles based on pronunciation. This really only exists during the final boss fight.\n\n- More sentences and integration with the phrases the game teaches you.\n\nI love this game.

I am [i]not[/i] having fun.\n\nThe lesson sets are fair educational material, with voice clips and tips on writing the hiragana, which are welcome enhancements. The music is fairly good. As a game, however, Hiragana Battle combines the worst missteps of the JRPG genre into a single frustrating experience. Gameplay is clunky and slow, made up of grindy battles in which every attack can take upwards of half a dozen key strokes. You can also use the mouse, but the game isn't well-geared to that either, and you have to click on the hiragana in the tiny menus instead where they loom large on the battle screen.\n\nDrilling the Hiragana by selecting (or better, typing) matching English syllables is a fine thought for practicing them, but every element of the interface seems designed to take as long as possible to navigate and use. Or more likely, they were the default settings of a sort of JRPG-maker program that the devs didn't bother to find a way to improve, despite the fact that they cripple the experience by inserting pointless user-unfriendliness into everything.\n\nQuests and story progression are not special, except that they also are laden with pointless, time-consuming delays and lazy design. Obstacles appear and disappear without explanation to railroad you through puzzles and the game takes up even more of your time with unskippable dialogue and cutscenes designed to show and tell you everything obvious so that you don't get a chance to explore anything on your own. For example, there is a quest to fix the broken bridge (of course) with three nearby logs. You will know where to find them without needing to explore because if you so much as approach the bridge, for the first, second, or twentieth time, your guide NPC will helpfully and vocally wish that you had some materials to fix it with, and you get to watch the camera slowly pan over to where the logs you need to go get are, and then slowly pan back. Then when you pick them up, you are treated to an identical dialogue pop-up congratulating you on finding each individual log, despite the fact that they are right next to one another.\n\nThere is no way to skip or quicken the repetitive animations, cutscenes and dialogue boxes that quickly become extremely tiresome. There is, however, a hotkey to quit to menu without confirmation and without saving, so you can lose all your session's progress with the press, even the accidental press, of a single button.\n\nI would love to have games help me learn, but when my blood pressure is screaming because I am too frustrated by abysmal game design to focus on anything else, I don't learn very well.

You begin the game entirely in English, and the cute little story gives you enough to learn Japanese gradually to survive. Slowly you'll have gorgeous little hiragana and vocab lessons, and side quests will open that give you more Japanese teaching as a reward. Certain VERY clever events happen that require you to take little leaps with your new Japanese knowledge, but I won't spoil those for you :) \n\nThe only downside is that the game itself is possibly a tad too hard. I would rather smash my Hiragana enemies (kindof like a battle quiz) rather than have them do bullshit attacks that damage my whole party and force me to reload areas.

The pacing of the game is excellent. The rate of which new hiragana is introduced was perfect for me And if you want to grind, it's also benifical for you to practice hiragana if you're struggling, but isn't required. \n\nStory: Well, it's unique. I'm not going to say this is the greatest rpg story in history, but still a better story and makes more sense than FFI. Laughed a few times, got hopefull around the middle, and then the story went flat again. But it was enough to keep me to the end.\n\nCharacters: your party stays with the same 4 and gains no new party members. Considering the mechanics, more characters aren't really needed as your main four aren't really special.\n\nMechanics: sadly, theres a lot to be desired for an rpg. I went through the whole game using only one other move in combat other than the \"attack\" button, and it was the heal for grinding. hopefully in the next game, they can have some kind of magic system that does some kind of speed read or something. But the point of the game is to teach Hiragana and the game accomplishes that in a more entertaining way than writing out the characters repeatedly. \n\nQuests/sidequests: main quest is stop the evil plan. Sidequest usually offer a better reward for going back to a place to grind for 5-10 minutes and can sometime work on your vocab which the main story doesn't focus on till the very very end.\n\nOverall, I feel good about my hiragana and was entertained enough by the game that I would buy the sequel for Katakana when it comes out. Would recommend if you're looking to learn hiragana and want to have a reward and evidence of your improvement along the way.\n\n*note* I found zero bugs during the game.", "timestamp_created": 1467916342, "timestamp_updated": 1467916587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24158878": {"recommendationid": "24158878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139115470", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504208740}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game for a beginner.

I will update this when I am finished playing the game.[/b]\n\nI've only played about 45 minutes of this but so far, it's great at teaching. It's best to have a notepad/paper and a pen handy to write things down, the game will actually tell you to go do that if you don't have one there already. The game takes things slow and encourages good ways of putthing things into memory. It starts off simple, teaching you the vowels with their pronounciation, equivalent characters in English and character in Hiragana for each one. It lets you learn things and provides options to repeat stuff so you don't have to worry about missing things and if you note things down as it tells you to, you'll start to pick them up fairly quick.\n\nI like how it teaches you how to read, speak and write Hiragana instead of just focusing on just one of those as a lot of other things seem to try and do. It also helps that it acknowledges learning another language is daunting and difficult so I feel I can trust in it more. It defintely helps with holding my attention.\n\nAnother thing I'm loving so far is that it's doing all of this within a traditional turn based RPG. So far it's fairly simple stuff for those elements but where it really stands out is that the enemies are Hiragana characters (potentially words and other stuff later on, I'm not far in) so that in addition to attacking, defending, support and item use, you have to actually understand the enemy in a very literal sense to damage them.\n\nThat really helps with learning as it gives you just enough pressure to keep your brain working and the things you're learning will start to fit into place as a side effect of playing. Instead of learning a bunch of stats and different elements or whatever enemies are weaker too, it's another language. The game is also just fun so far and both the characters and the story are quite charming. This isn't a game that's concent with boring the player.\n\nIt's not perfect as the dialogue text characters, the on screen characters and the how to draw/write animations for characters are all a little different to each other so it can get a little confusing when learning the correct way to write stuff but I guess that gets you used to different writing styles and it didn't get in the way much, I just wanted to make sure I was writing things down perfectly.

"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499791255}, "language": "french", "review": "Petit avertissement avant que je ne commence : la culture Japonaise ne me passionne pas. Alors pourquoi j'ai achet\u00e9 ce jeu, me demanderez-vous ? Parce que je suis passionn\u00e9 de langues \u00e9trang\u00e8res et que je ne manque jamais une occasion d'en apprendre et de me perfectionner. L\u00e0, en l'occurence, j'ai une occasion d'apprendre le Japonais de mani\u00e8re amusante, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 l'aide d'un RPG, genre avec lequel j'ai grandi. M\u00eame si, niveau culture, ma passion est plut\u00f4t situ\u00e9e en Scandinavie. Mais qu'on se le dise avant que j'oublie : jamais un RPG n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi instructif.\n\nAlors d\u00e9j\u00e0, ce jeu a bien \u00e9videmment \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sous RPG Maker MV. Ne vous arr\u00eatez pas sur ce d\u00e9tail, il est \u00e9vident d\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re heure de jeu qu'un \u00e9norme travail a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni dedans ! Le sc\u00e9nario de ce jeu tient sur quatre lignes. L\u00e0 encore, ne vous arr\u00eatez pas sur ce d\u00e9tail ! Etant donn\u00e9 que l'objectif de ce jeu est d'apprendre une langue et pas de suivre une histoire, c'est tr\u00e8s bien comme \u00e7a. Attention, il y a bel et bien un sc\u00e9nario, et il est suffisamment ficel\u00e9 pour vous pousser \u00e0 apprendre le Japonais. Parce que la qualit\u00e9 de ce jeu r\u00e9side dans son gameplay. Globalement, comment \u00e7a fonctionne ?\n\nDans un \u00e9cran de combat, vous ne combattez pas des monstres. Vous combattez des hiragana. Si vos capacit\u00e9s d\u00e9fensives sont similaires \u00e0 un JRPG classique, il n'en est rien pour vos capacit\u00e9s offensives. Vous vous battez avec des romaji (la traduction des syllabes avec les 26 lettres de notre alphabet), et le seul moyen d'infliger des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts \u00e0 un hiragana est de l'attaquer avec le romaji correspondant. Il n'y a aucun autre moyen d'infliger des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts. En d'autre termes : un combat = un exercice d'entra\u00eenement. Jamais le grind n'aura \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi instructif.\n\nTout \u00e7a c'est bien joli, mais vous allez forc\u00e9ment me faire une r\u00e9flexion : combattre des hiragana en pronon\u00e7ant des romaji fait certes apprendre comment on prononce les hiragana, mais il serait opportun de combattre des lettres de la notation \"\u00e0 nous\" avec des hiragana - c'est-\u00e0-dire faire l'exercice dans l'autre sens. Justement, le jeu a pens\u00e9 \u00e0 vous et vous le propose \u00e0 partir d'un certain stade du sc\u00e9nario. Bon, en fait, vous n'avez pas le choix. Et, cerise sur le g\u00e2teau : le moment o\u00f9 vous devez faire l'exercice dans l'autre sens colle parfaitement au sc\u00e9nario. Je n'en dis pas plus.\n\nComment fonctionnent les le\u00e7ons ? Concr\u00e8tement, et le jeu met bien l'accent dessus, ce jeu a beau \u00eatre addictif et amusant, il ne vous instruit seulement si vous jouez le jeu. Pr\u00e9parez un cahier et un stylo ! Les le\u00e7ons sont accompagn\u00e9es d'une musique douce aux sonorit\u00e9s orientales qui est la bienvenue. Le jeu vous apprend non seulement quel romaji va avec quel hiragana, mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 les prononcer correctement et \u00e0 les \u00e9crire (les hiragana). En effet, la majorit\u00e9 des hiragana sont compos\u00e9es de plus d'un coup de crayon, et les coups de crayon ne se font pas dans n'importe quel ordre. Le jeu vous le montre de mani\u00e8re anim\u00e9e.\n\nVous commencez facilement, en apprenant les voyelles a, i, u, e, o (et pas a, e, i, o, u, mais ne vous en faites pas, vous vous y ferez rapidement). Vous apprendrez ensuite la s\u00e9rie des ka, vous apprendrez au fil du jeu ce qu'est un dakuten et un handakuten et comment ils changent un hiragana. Chaque le\u00e7on est accompagn\u00e9e d'un quiz pour v\u00e9rifier que vous avez compris la dite le\u00e7on. Niveau combats, et c'est important de le signaler, lorsque vous arrivez dans une nouvelle zone, vous combattrez, parmi les \"monstres\", les nouveaux hiragana fra\u00eechement appris ET dans la foul\u00e9e, des anciens. Niveau RPG, forc\u00e9ment vos personnages ne gagneront pas grand chose. C'est vous, le joueur, qui r\u00e9viserez vos acquis et consolidez vos connaissances.\n\nLe jeu contient \u00e9galement des qu\u00eates annexes qui vous en dira plus sur la culture Japonaise. M\u00eame si cette culture, comme je l'ai \u00e9voqu\u00e9, ne m'int\u00e9resse pas tellement, un peu d'instruction sur le reste du monde ne fait jamais de mal. Vous apprendrez aussi du vocabulaire. Si vous jouez le jeu jusqu'au bout, vous pourrez \u00e9crire les mots fra\u00eechement acquis sur votre cahier. Lorsque vous arriverez \u00e0 Tokyo, vous commencerez \u00e0 lire vos premiers dialogues en Japonais (m\u00eame si c'est juste \"ohayou gozaimasu\", faut bien commencer quelque part). Par exemple, un gar\u00e7on vous demandera d'acheter un manga dans la boutique. Sauf que dans la boutique, parmi ce que vous pourrez acheter, vous trouverez un tas d'articles dont l'intitul\u00e9 est r\u00e9dig\u00e9... En hiragana ! Cela ne se produit pas au d\u00e9but du jeu, aussi ne n\u00e9gligez pas le grind, cela n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi instructif.\n\nConcr\u00e8tement, parmi les d\u00e9fauts, il n'y en a qu'un seul : un bug mineur, mais rien de bien m\u00e9chant. Pour ceux qui sont curieux : dans le village en ruines, quand j'ouvre une le\u00e7on et que je reviens sur la map, l'effet \"safran\" dispara\u00eet. Rien qui n'emp\u00eache de jouer.\n\nCe jeu, en plus d'\u00eatre une tr\u00e8s bonne m\u00e9thode de langue, d\u00e9montre que quoi qu'on en dise, h\u00e9 bien oui ! Oui, il est possible de s'instruire gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un jeu vid\u00e9o ! Et surtout, ce jeu d\u00e9montre que m\u00eame dans un genre qui ne se pr\u00eate pas vraiment \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation, il est possible de faire un jeu instructif. Et surtout : un jeu instructif et amusant \u00e0 la fois.\n\nA qui s'adresse ce jeu ? Aux \"weeabos\" qui en ont marre qu'on les appelle \"weeabos\" et veulent passer aux choses s\u00e9rieuses. A ceux qui veulent apprendre le Japonais, tout simplement. Ou, alors, \u00e0 ceux comme moi qui sont passionn\u00e9s de langues \u00e9trang\u00e8res et de RPGs. Surtout qu'\u00e0 ce prix-l\u00e0, cela serait vraiment dommage de passer \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9.\n\nQu'est-ce que vous attendez ?", "timestamp_created": 1466501906, "timestamp_updated": 1466501906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 189, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.938257", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23679602": {"recommendationid": "23679602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129310693", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458676782}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u770b\u5230\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e00\u908a\u73a9\u904a\u6232\u4e00\u908a\u5b78\u65e5\u6587\u5c31\u99ac\u4e0a\u8cb7\u4e86\uff01\n\u4f46\u73a9\u4e86\u4e4b\u5f8c\u624d\u767c\u73fe...\nTMD \u6211\u82f1\u6587\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6bd4\u65e5\u6587\u9084\u721b\u554aw\n\u5f9e\u982d\u5230\u5c3e\u6839\u672c\u770b\u4e0d\u61c2\u554a xDDD", "timestamp_created": 1466479570, "timestamp_updated": 1466479570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 64, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706291", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23638328": {"recommendationid": "23638328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109893426", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466279983}, "language": "english", "review": "I Really Enjoyed This Game.

When I was searching some random games on Steam and saw this special game. It is hard for me to find a way to start and here it is, a game for the beginner to learn Japanese characters and vocabs. However, I can't fully recommend this game for everyone to play because it is not easy to learn-and-remember in this game, even I take lots of notes and keep practicing on writing the characters. It is a method for me (maybe including anyone) to 'Learn' Hiragana but not 'Remember' Hiragana. Maybe it is just me having some learning problems, but seriously, the game's battle system is quite boring that you focus on defeating the enemies and get money to buy stuffs, then go to the next area and do the same thing. The aim still is still finishing the game and have a happy ending after a while I may forget all I have learnt and wasted several hours. I don't mean that playing this game is wasting time but it is not a choice to keep learning Japanese.

Einen K\u00e4ufer habt ihr auf jeden Fall.\n\nNun aber zum eigentlichen Bericht:\n\nIch habe mir dieses Spiel gekauft, da ich schon immer an Japan interessiert war und schon mal die Schriftzeichen lernen wollte. Leider ist es halt so, dass man sie schnell wieder vergisst, wenn man sie nicht mehr aktiv lernt oder dass man nach kurzer Zeit keine Lust mehr hat sie stupide auswendig zu lernen. \n\nDeswegen dachte ich, dass dieses Spiel eine interessante Alternative zur Karteikarte sei und das ist es auch.\n\n+ Man f\u00e4ngt mit einem Set an Zeichen an und lernt im Laufe der Zeit immer wieder neue Sets.\n+ Die Story wird zwar keinen Oscar gewinnen, ist aber unterhaltsam genug um weiter zu spielen.\n+ Die Grafik ist passend. Insbesondere Fans alter JRPGs ala Final Fantasy werden sich freuen. \n+ Der Preis ist mehr als fair\n\n- Im Allgemeinen ist das Spiel sehr repetitiv. Man lernt ein neues Set an Zeichen und geht dann in ein Gebiet, in dem man vorrangig von diesen Zeichen attackiert wird, welche man besiegt indem man ihnen ihre \u00dcbersetzung an den Kopf wirft. Wenn das geschafft ist, lernt man mehr Zeichen, geht in ein neues Gebiet, \u00fcbersetzt die gelernten Zeichen usw usw.\n- Leider kein Wiederspielwert\n- Sprache leider nur auf Englisch\n\nIch bin mir nat\u00fcrlich bewusst, dass man nur durch Repetition lernt, aber ein wenig mehr Abwechslung w\u00e4re lustig. Vielleicht mal Gegner einbringen, die man nicht durch \u00dcbersetzungen besiegt, sondern in alter FF-Manier. Das ist jedoch Kritik auf sehr hohem Niveau. \nEin weiterer Kritikpunkt ist, dass jedes Gebiet sein eigenes Set an Zeichen hat, die vorrangig attackieren, was dazu f\u00fchrt, dass, wenn ich mal ein altes Set wiederholen m\u00f6chte, ich in Gebiete gehen muss, die keine Erfahrungspunkte mehr bringen oder storytechnisch vollkommen irrelevant geworden sind. Da w\u00e4re es sch\u00f6ner, dass geschaffte Gebiete einfach alle Zeichen mit der selben Wahrscheinlchkeit beherbergen.\n\nSumma Summarum: Ein Spiel, welches mir sehr viel Spa\u00df gemacht hat und welches ich noch oft starten werde um zu \u00fcben.\n\nTl;dR:\nKauft es!

Some of the best games of the last few decades have been either first released in Japan or exclusively released in Japan. A lot of the times, nice folks who know the Japanese language will translate Japanese games so that we can enjoy them to their fullest. However, that may take a while, if it ever happens at all. Besides, self-reliance is an underrated thing. Now, if you\u2019re a chowderhead like me, then you only know one language, and that\u2019s \u2018murcan. But what if you want to broaden your horizons? You could take a Japanese course at school. But only if your school offers it, and if it\u2019s a college course, you may be spending quite a bit of money on the course and books. You could buy Rosetta Stone, but that could cost you up to $200. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m not a great learner in the normal classroom setting. I\u2019ve tried games before like My Japanese Coach, but I was bored and frustrated soon after starting. I\u2019ve always wanted to learn Japanese, but have never found a way that works for me.\n\nAnd now this is starting to sound like an infomercial, and as much as I love me some infomercials, I purchased Learn Japanese to Survive: Hiragana Battle from the Steam store on a whim the day it launched. I didn\u2019t even know this was a thing until the day I bought it, but I saw the $7 price tag and good early reviews and figured I\u2019d give Japanese one last shot. It\u2019s been one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made.\n\nHiragana Battle is an educational game. It teaches the player Hiragana, one of the 3 forms of the Japanese language, in the wrapper of a traditional JRPG. Misaki, your Japanese instructor, gives you lessons. You\u2019ll then set out to the world map and fight Hiragana characters by selecting the matching sound they represent.\n\nThe story, which isn\u2019t of much importance, goes like this: Noboru, a strange, unkempt man, is summoning Hiragana characters into the real world in hopes of taking over the land. It\u2019s up to you and your friends to fight off the Hiragana Warriors and seal the gates before Noboru gains too much leverage and conquers Japan and all around it. But of course, you don\u2019t know any Japanese at all, so you have hit the books before you\u2019re able to save the world.\n\nHiragana Battle is made using the RPG Maker engine, an engine I quite like. And the game looks very good, for that sort of style. It does have an aura of being generic, mainly because this is how most of the games made with the RPG Maker engine look, but it\u2019s well-done nonetheless. I never looked at anything in the game and said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s just ugly.\u201d It\u2019s a good looking game, even if it isn\u2019t the most impressive looking game.\n\nThe lessons are nice. Calming music plays in the background as you\u2019re told about each Hiragana character. Unfortunately, you are going to have to break out a notebook and do some old school learning, as Misaki will ask you to practice writing each character. Even though this is by far the least fun part of the game, it's actually very beneficial as you'll more than likely need to recall back to earlier sets of characters later in the game. And although you have the option to revisit an earlier lesson with Misaki, it's a lot easier to be able to flip through a notebook. Throughout my 15-hour playthrough I took several pages of notes which gave me a much needed crutch. \n\nYou see, Hiragana Battle doesn't do a great job of mixing up all of the characters throughout the game. You'll go hours and hours without seeing some of the earlier characters and if you don't have a great memory, like myself, then you're going to have to look back in your notebook to see which character is which. There are many characters that look nearly identical with the only difference being the stroke of a final line. \n\nWhich brings me to my next qualm with the game: the confusing font. Most of the time, we see Japanese characters typed out. Whether that be on a website or in a game, you usually see the same font. Hiragana Battle includes this font in the game in their menus, but when Misaki teaches you how to write the characters, and when the characters show up in battle, they\u2019re a more stylized version. Often times, they look different than what we read as normal Japanese font, and this can also make things very confusing for beginners. However, it does teach you to recognize the characters in different fonts, so it can be a good thing.\n\nI was able to triumph over all of that and push forward, and soon after, I started recognizing Hiragana characters on Twitter from all the Japanese wrestling posts I see and from the man himself, Mother/Earthbound creator Shigesato Itoi. And I kept going forward. And then I started recognizing Japanese words, and that excitement continued to push me through to the end of the game. One of the more interesting things that Hiragana Battle does is, towards the end of the game, it\u2019ll start listing items, weapons, and armor in Japanese only, so you\u2019ll have to be able to read the word in Japanese to understand what you\u2019re buying. There was a side-quest where some dude in Japan really wanted a Manga issue, and I had to go down to the convenience store, look at their items that were only listed in Japanese, and then read and buy the correct item to give him. The feeling I got when I read \u201cmanga\u201d in Japanese was euphoric. It was a sign the game was truly working.\n\nAlong with the main quest, you\u2019ll have side-quests. Most of these are fetch quests, but all of them teach you new vocabulary. You can also acquire special points from these side quests to help boost the levels of your party members.\n\nEvery RPG element about this game is pretty standard and basic. You\u2019re not going to see any new functions. You fight enemies to earn money, you spend that money on better weapons and armor, you level up to get stronger, and you save after every battle. If all of your party members die in Hiragana Battle, it\u2019ll reload to your last save, so make sure that you\u2019re saving every few minutes.\n\nHiragana Battle isn\u2019t a perfect game by any means. It has issues both on the RPG side and on the teaching side. I would have like to have seen some form of mnemonic teaching in the game, aka helping the player remember by relating the character to something else, like a kangaroo for ru or a pig tail for su. But then again, maybe it\u2019s best to leave that up to the player.\n\nEven with its flaws, Hiragana Battle is well worth the $7 asking price. $7 will teach you all the characters in the Hiragana set, plus grammar and punctuation, vocabulary, and even some common phrases. And it\u2019ll do it in a way that keeps you engaged. It\u2019s about time someone used the grind of RPG\u2019s for an educational purpose. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been done before, but learning the Japanese language through a traditional JRPG is just about the best combination you can come up with. \n\nThe developers, Sleepy Duck Educational Games, have plans for a sequel that will teach the next phase of the Japanese language, which they plan to call Katakana War. It\u2019s good to know that you can invest in Hiragana Battle and be able to continue forth at some point in the same style. I will definitely be buying Katakana War, and if you\u2019re interested in learning Japanese, I highly recommend you pick up Hiragana Battle.", "timestamp_created": 1457115595, "timestamp_updated": 1457115595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.745231", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21614520": {"recommendationid": "21614520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198244366700", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457146639}, "language": "english", "review": "I've only been playing about 45 minutes and I find it very relaxing and enjoyable.

Putting it in this simple JRPG format did the trick. I ended up having a lot of fun and took down about 20 pages of notes in the process, and that's not counting side quest vocabulary I didn't bother writing down but probably should have.\n\nOn the plus side:\n[list]\n[*]It's simple and accessible, especially if you're familiar with traditional 2D JRPGs\n[*]Moves at an easy pace, only throwing a few new characters at you per area\n[*]Has some humor and plot to it without being dumb or overly cheesy\n[*]Actually helps you learn Hiragana\n[*]Clear explanations of many subtle aspects of the language, like dakuten or particles.\n[/list]\n\nOn the negative side:\n[list]\n[*]Despite the presence of several buff skills, they don't see much use, so the combat's missing on depth most of the time\n[*]Gear is likewise mostly linear upgrades with a few unique pieces here and there\n[*]There's no way to limit encounters. You'll sometimes trigger 3 fights in 10 steps and wish you had Repel or something similar to halt them for a while as you search for an item or NPC. An Escape Rope mechanic to quickly return to town would be great for the very few times you need to backtrack into a dungeon as well. (The game teleports you out nearly every other time.)\n[/list]\n\nOn the hit/miss side:\n[list]\n[*]Voice acting is usually great, but sometimes it's unclear or too abrupt to understand.\n[*]Demonstrates stroke order and gives tips for how to properly write all characters, which is awesome. But in-game font, character image used for enemies, and handwriting tutorials often differ from eachother and occasionally cause confusion. (I'm looking at you, \u308a!)\n[/list]\n\nMy best moment in the game: When it started throwing words at me instead of just isolated characters and I realized I could read most of them.

Die Art und Weise des Lernens selbst ist ganz Nett gemacht.. einziges Manko - Das Kampfsystem. Anfangs mag es Nett wirken das man das richtige Symbol / den Englischen Buchstaben w\u00e4hlen muss.. jedoch nervt es ungemein wenn man zig mal das gleiche Symbol w\u00e4hlen muss und wenn dann noch mehrere \"Hiragana Warriors\" aufm Feld sind kann das ganze ziemlich nervig werden. Ich kann also den 2 Negativen Bewertungen hier in diesem Bezug Recht geben.. es IST nervig von der Men\u00fcstruktur her gesehen da es umst\u00e4ndlich ist wenn man 4 Gegner hat, und dann beispielweise 2 eigene Charaktere.. denn das muss man 2x4 bis 4x4 mal Angreifen.. und bei jedem dieser Angriffe muss man erst w\u00e4hlen welchen \"Angriff\" (die englische entsprechung des gegners) man nutzen m\u00f6chte,und dann welchen \"Hiragana Warrior\" man angreifen m\u00f6chte.. was ziemlich nervig wird auf Dauer. Da mir aber der Style des Games (Grafik etc.) gef\u00e4llt, und ich eh Japanisch lernen m\u00f6chte behalte ich das Spiel und werde es nicht umtauschen. Schlecht ist das Spiel nicht.. nur ist die Men\u00fc Struktur etwas Doof gel\u00f6st - da sollte man eventuell nochmals etwas anpassen als Entwickler. \nIch habe das Spiel soweit gespielt das ich meinen ersten Kampf hinter mir hatte, dort gab es 1 Gegner und man hatte 2 Spielfiguren zu steuern.

My brains mud now.\n\nIt wasnt too much fun in the end but very satisfying for me to get through this, after all I now can read at least some hiragana. Forget the vocabulary. Its just good for learning to read the hiragana in my opinion. Dont expect to learn a lot or be able to speak a lot. It really is mostly about the Hiragana writing system.\n\nMy Hiragana is not perfect by playing through this a single time but far better than before. And I guess thats all one can ask for after just ten hours. That furthermore makes maybe 4-5 hours of intensive studying for me, since I knew a lot of the hiragana before and could concentrate on fighting through the game instead of writing down all the letters. In fact I did not write down a single hiragana. Cant tell how far in what time one comes when being an absolute beginner. \n\nI\u00b4d suggest to use a memrise course along this journey if you play through it in chunks, what I absolutely recommend for  a beginner since else your brain might burn out. Keep calm if you feel overwhelmed, its really not that hard and will get easier and easier with the time you are ready to invest.\n\nGlad this game exists, cant wait for what they anounce in the end, wont spoil it though :P\n\n\nI recommend it to everybody who wants to learn in the first place, since it is very likely that the game depth and mechanics wont be whats satisfying in the end for many people.

Below is a list of pros and cons I have found within the game so far. \n\n-------------------------------------\n\n\u2731Pros:\u2731\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n\u2764 1.)  The order the lesson is presented to you. \n\nDetails: I really like the order they present the material(s) to you, and I think it is one of the best styles I have seen for a beginner learner.\n\n\u2764  2.) Defeating the \"hiragana.\" \n\nDetails: Although, this might be a minus for some, I like it. You have to constantly kill the same hiragana, but there is enough of a mix, that it does not get boring to me. Repetition is key to learning a new language.\n\n\u2764 3.) The side quests \n\n Details: The side quests are optional but give you the option to expand your vocabulary. I really like how they just don't focus on the hiragana alone. This and visuals are sometimes shown through out the side quests, which help! I have also learned a little culture from it, like types of food and drinks in Japan.\n\n\u2764 4.) The \"lessons\" \n\nDetails: The lessons have a listening and writing part, which I really enjoyed. If you actually read what Misaki says, it gives you a lot of good tips! I highly recommend not skipping through it. The quizzes are nice. They don't grade you, just check your comprehension and do not let you go to the next question until you select the correct choice. (Although the monsters are not as forgiving. haha)\n\n\u2764  5.) The humor \n\nDetails: As you start in the game, the humor is quite funny. *At least to me*. (SPOILER: Leon's story about the pumpkins. The snowman in the town and the dog in snowleaf village, etc.)\n\n\u2764 6.)  \"Bonus point crystal\" \n\nDetails: As you do side quests, you get bonus points which you can turn into the \"bonus crystal\" next to Misaki that you can exchange for levels. \n\n\u2764 7.) Option to review with Misaki \n\nDetail: I like the option to review when you want to!\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\u2731Cons:\u2731\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\u2718 1.) The story \n\nDetails: The story is a bit ridiculous and it is sometimes hard to take the game seriously, but if you remember you are here to learn the language versus playing a game, a lot of this cons can be overlooked.\n\n\u2718 2.) The interface \n\nDetails: There is some features I think that can be added to help the game be a little more smoother for the learner. One  is as you progress and learn more hiragana, the list obviously gets bigger. However, as it gets bigger no arrow/scroll is shown, so as a beginner you are searching through the big list of hiragana and not realizing there are more choices. I got stuck for a good 5 minutes the first time this issue arose. I could not find the choice, so I thought I had remembered incorrectly. Load and behold, I scrolled down on my mouse because I became frustrated and the list scrolled down and there were more choices! This seems so obvious now, but it might be a similar problem to someone else. In addition, I think the hiragana should have an hp box. It is a bit annoying not knowing how many more hits I have to do before I should pick the next pair. (For example: I might pick answer \"ko\" for the hiragana \"\u3053\" for ALL my players, and than the hiragana dies...and the player still attacks with the answer \"ko\" to the next mob...even though it is \"\u304b\". I found this to be VERY annoying.) However, one you are in the area a bit, you start realizing how many hits the hiragana needs before it dies.\n\n\u2718 3.) Too easy to \"escape\" \n\nDetails: For me, I like a little strategy in a game. So this might not be a con for some. Whenever you click the option to \"escape\" you always do. There is no real struggle. So I could go through a dungeon without practicing any hiragana. (You need to for money and exp though.)\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\u2731Other suggestions to the game that I feel are not critical but would help the game.\u2731\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\n1.) \u2765 Customization\n\nDetails: It is a bit boring to not see the characters change at all as you give them new equipment or items. I wish I could name the main character too.\n\n2.) \u2765 More variety earlier\n\nDetails: As I have progressed through the game, I did see change; however it is a bit of a too slow of a pace in my opinion. \n\n3.) \u2765 Features to include:\n\nDetails: Things that I think that should be added but not necessary. I wish as they attacked there was sound effects. For example when you answer \"e\", it would be nice if the character pronounced the hiragana. This gives repetition and makes it easier for the listener to remember how it is pronounced. There should be a feature where you can turn it off too, for the people who think it would be too annoying. Secondly, when you are getting exp, it will show a bar and +number of exp earned, but there is no numbers on the bar. It is not too annoying, and it might be cleaner for some gamers, but I like seeing the numbers. Maybe you can include a feature to add or remove numbers to both exp bars and hp/mp bars. Thirdly, when going to the inn to rest, it does not show you how much money you have. Although it is very cheap (only 10\u00a5 and you should have it), it still seems weird not to see it. I would feel differently if it was free.  Lastly, I think when you save the game it should say where you are located. The only way I can tell the difference between the files is by the hours I have played.\n\n4.) \u2765 More side quests + order they appear\n\nDetails: When the side quests are first introduced they all appear at once! I am an eager learner, so I tackled them all at once, hoping more would come as the game progressed. So far...NOPE. I think the pacing of the appearance of them should be fixed. The learned might either get overwhelmed or bored due to no new variety. \n\n5.) \u2765 Stealing the little boy's  life savings from the vase\n\nDetails:  I just think it is a sad feature, that maybe we should have the option to give it back.\n\n6.) \u2765 Starting a new game (Option to skip dialogue or repeat it)\n\nDetails: Although you can mash the \"esc\" key; It would be nice to skip, as a return player.\n\n7.) \u2765  Double checking (Are you sure you want to quit?)\n\nDetails: The game doesn't ask if you want to save or if you are sure you would like to quit, when clicking the \"x\". Same with selling things, it just sells it.\n\n8.) \u2765 BOSS fights\n\nDetails: I think it should be a BIGGER hiragana that changes as you hit it. This would be a bit of a variety OR you should introduce kanji!!  It can review the vocabulary we already learned....like \"\u72ac\" (\u3044\u306c) [dog].  How to attack: the boss comes in and it shows the kanji + hiragana + english. After the monster gets to 75% the hiragana disappears, Than the english at 50%. I think it would be fun and challenging!\n\n9.) \u2765 In game notepad\n\nDetails: Just a suggestion, but not needed.\n\n10.) \u2765 Equipment tutorial.\n\nDetails: It is a bit confusing. I self-taught myself but it is a bit frustrating not having a bit of a guide.\n\n-------------------------\n\n\u25ba Additional remarks:\n\n-------------------------\n\n\u273f Great for the \"gamer\" learner!\n\u273f The game is just $6.99 (at present), why not give it a shot? It is far cheaper than other options out there.\n\u273f Remember to save your game a lot!", "timestamp_created": 1455826130, "timestamp_updated": 1455837358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517022", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21302542": {"recommendationid": "21302542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048331584", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455709827}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0416\u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044f \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e \u0445\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0443 D:", "timestamp_created": 1455822613, "timestamp_updated": 1455822613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469713", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21302187": {"recommendationid": "21302187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085749803", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456853904}, "language": "english", "review": "7$ to lear hiragan writing and pronounciation... hell yeahm also, its really well done and give you greate examples, tips and a good and fun way to study it.", "timestamp_created": 1455821738, "timestamp_updated": 1455821738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21300086": {"recommendationid": "21300086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118270819", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455815329}, "language": "english", "review": "Holy crap.

They should consistently morph or do something slightly cleverer.\n\nAside from that, wasting your time with clunky JRPG mechanics from the 80s while you're trying to learn is annoying. \n\nThe concept is cute, but just focus on making it exclusively a learning game next time. Nobody who's up for learning a writing system needs to be entertained by junky JRPG mechanics like a child.\n\n\nLonger edit:\n\nI can't go too in-depth as I've only put about 40 minutes into the game before I dropped it.\n\nThe battle system is very simplistic - you slap the Hiragana character icons repeatedly with their corresponding english sound and use typical video games skills that have nothing to do with language learning like heal skills.\n\nIt's simply a missed opportunity. The battle system hasn't got any depth, there's no reason the Hiragana characters shouldn't just die in one hit to their corresponding sound and/or replace themselves with others, and all the video-gamey stuff is very detracting from the actual learning.\nBeyond slapping characters around there doesn't seem to be anything more, for example an integrated drawing tool to recognize that you can draw the characters.\n\n\nWhat I learned in 40 minutes of playing this I could have learned in a youtube video of 5 minutes. And it shouldn't necessarily be that way. Yes, I get that it's a game, but it's a learning tool first. Nobody's gonna get into this game thinking \"hmmm I crave a real good JRPG right now\", it's purely for the learning in an enjoyable way - it is neither a good learning tool nor enjoyable.\n\n\nSeems like this review is garnering a lot of traction. I say judge for yourselves, and refund it like I did if you don't like it. But let me tell you as someone who speaks multiple languages fluently - this is a very poor learning tool, even for something as basic as this.

Its a great tool to use to learn basic Japanese and its a lot of fun while you do it. Buy it. It will be one of the best $6.99 purchases you have made in a while!\n\nThis game focuses on teaching the player Hiragana, one of the more basic japanese writing systems, while still maintaining the old pixel RPG adventure games. It has a good story line for what it is and some pretty charming art and music.\n\nI haven't played it a ton so far, but from what I got out of that short time is actually pretty good! This game has you learn japanese you've learned from previous lessons to take down all of the enemies in the game. So,\n\nThe more you pay attention, practice saying the Hiragana and taking notes, the better you will do.\n\nThat brings me to the note taking. If you are a beginner in Japanese, notes are ESSENTIAL. The game even tells you to go get a pen/pencil and a piece of paper. Though while you are practicing the Hiragana strokes as it has you do, they do seem a bit tedious in the beginning. It isnt enough to make the game feel terrible and not worth it but you do have to put in a good amount of effort to learn and play the game.\n\nSo to sum it up, the game is good. If you want a rating i'd give it a 7/10. It has great music, good art, you can go somewhat at your own pace and the story is pretty good from what it is. For $6.99 its worth it. Definitely.

You earn Yen by defeating the Hiragana characters that pop up when you run around kinda like Pok\u00e9mon. If the enemy looking like the character \u3042 pops up you must choose \"A\" from the attack menu as this character is the equivilent of A in the English Language. If it's wrong you do 0 damage and if it is correct then you do the damage that your character(s) can achieve.\n\nIt has a surprisingly good storyline to it, and it has a good amout of repition in it to help you learn the characters. It has good graphics and the way it teaches you to learn these characters is pretty effective. I WOULD recommend writing them down on a note pad as you will certainly need some kind of reference to help you along with the new characters in the beginning. Mine looks like this puu.sh/nblSN/4b6e41845b.jpg . \n\nI recommend it, it's only \u00a35 and I bought it because I said to my friend before I was interested in it but I didn't really have an incentive to learn, but this is great because I actually want to play it since it's a game. \n\nTL;DR It keeps you entertained, it's a good story and It has good ways of teaching.

You don't need to have any previous Japanese knowledge in order to play and enjoy the game.\n---\nTeaching: Outstanding 6/6 - The game did its job, I can name or write every Hiragana without much thinking (1-3 sek).\n*** Every other category below didn't really matter to me but I will give my oppinion if people do want my oppinion. ***\n---\nStory: Good 4/6 - The story was prety basic and somewhat predictable, (for an educational game, it was good, as it progressed the practicing of Hiragana).\n---\nGraphics: Very Good 5/6 - The character images were an outstanding 6/6 for me, really well made, the character sprites and the overworld were a good 4/6, pretty standard for an RPGMaker type of game.\n---\nMusic: Very Good 5/6 - The overworld/town/area music was different so it never got stale, I enjoyed listening to it, the combat music was also good, I really liked the victory theme (after the jingle I usually continued, never letting it play, because I assumed it will be a loop).\n---\nGameplay: Good 4/6 - The combat was pretty standart, the only skills your party has are support/buff skills, only the enemy had debuff and special attack skills.\n---\nOverall:\nAs an educational game: 6/6\nAs a turn-based RPG: 4.5/6\n\n\nLong version:\nThis review will consist of 2 parts, a long part looking at the game as an educational game, and a short part looking at the game as a turn-based RPG. \n***I won't go much into the story to avoid spoilers, though some minor spoilers might occur.***\n\nAs an educational game, the goal of \"Learn Japanese To Survive! Hiragana Battle\" is to teach you Hiragana. In the end, you will know how to read, write and pronounce every Hiragana. As the game suggests, do have a notebook and a pen ready so you can take notes and practice.\n- Lessons:\nAt the start of each lesson, the game shows you (with minor exceptions) 5 Hiragana characters and tells you one by one,  how to pronounce, read and correctly write each of them. In those lessons, you can take your time to repeat the pronunciation and practice how to write each character in your notebook. Some characters were easy to write and I needed only 1-2 tries to copy the animation, some characters were more difficult and took me up to 6 tries. Now practicing to \"perfectly\" write every Hiragana was just for my satisfaction and is in no way required to progress through the game. In the end of each lesson, there is a small quiz showing you the Hiragana and you need to choose the coresponding sound in English and then vice versa.\nSome lessons also include useful vocabulary of comonly used words. You can see the word written in Romaji (with English letters), then written in Hiragana (only the characters you've already learned, the others were in English syllables) and finally the translation what the word means.\nAt the end, there are also lessons of some sentences like introducing yourself, how to thank people etc.\n- Revising\nAfter passing the small quiz, it's time to start revising/practicing the Hiragana characters you just learned. This is done by going into different places (following the main story quest) which are overrun by Hiragana. When you meet them, you have to choose the right English sound to match it with, if you chose correctly, you'll do damage to the Hiragana, if you choose the incorrect sillable, you do no damage. Later in the game, you'll also see the English syllables and you need to choose the correct Hiragana to match them with. [spoiler]At the very end, words formed of Hiragana will attack you and you have to choose the correct word. The final boss battle also had an unique battle style for the game.[/spoiler]\nAt later stages, you might not only find the Hiragana you just learned from the lesson, but also find some older Hiragana, that way you can practice newly learned Hiragana and revise the ones from previous lessons.\nA minor complaint I had with the battles was, that the different Hiragana characters were put into \"sets\" and before every battle, a set was randomly chosen by the game. On occasions this led to having to fight the same set of Hiragana 4 times in a row where all the Hiragana were positioned the exact same way.\n- Extra Learning\nThe game offers additional learning content in form of side quests. I highly recommend doing them, as it teaches you aditional words and phrases after completing the sidequest. Those quests reward you also with Bonus Points, you can exchange 10 of them for a free instant level up for the whole party (completely optional). If you are purely playing for the educational part, I would suggest using them, as you will be overleveled, meaning you will be outspeeding the Hiragana and defeating them in one hit. \"But won't this make the game too easy?\" - I hear you ask? Well, not really, because if you choose the wrong syllable, no matter how overleveled you are, you will do 0 damage for getting it wrong, the only other point is the Hiragana will be unable to defeat you because of your high defence and life points. For me it was just \"Ok, I got the right sound, enemy should be defeated so I can move on\" or \"Oh, I got the wrong one, let me try again\".\n- Conclusion\nI am really satisfied as how the game teaches Hiragana, I am totally recomending it, the developers did an outstanding job! I already got me \"Learn Japanese To Survive! Katakana War\" and will get me \"Learn Japanese To Survive! Kanji Combat\" when  it releases.\n\n===\n\nI won't review \"Learn Japanese To Survive! Hiragana Battle\" as a turn-based RPG that deeply, as I am not the biggest fan of the genre, but I don't really mind playing them either. You'll have (soon after the beginning) a party of 4 people. The plot is pretty straightforward, a bad guy wants to take over Japan and you need to stop him.\n- Know your Enemy\nBefore going out to fight your enemy, you get some lore about their only weakness, namely you understanding their name (a la Rumpelstiltskin). If you get the name of the enemy correct, they take damage, if not, you can't harm them at all. \n- Get stronger\nBy defeating the enemy, you get experience and money. By leveling up, your characters are getting different special skills, although, the only skills your party gets are support and buff skills. The enemy on the other hand gets debuff and special attack skills.\n- Side quests and gear\nBy doing the optional side quests, you get some money or items and Bonus Points, by collecting 10 BP, you can trade them in for an instant level up for the whole party. It really depends if you want to have a challenge or to be overpowered, so only use them if you want. The local shops also offer a variety of equipment and items to help you on your quest.\n\nThe only minor complaint I had was when viewing your character stats, when viewing one, you couldn't switch to the other char by simply pressing left or right, you had to go back to the stat menu and manually choose the other character (funny enough, in the \"buy\" screen in shop, pressing left or right did go to the other characters). Another minor complaint was the order of the 4 characters, one of them is so slow, the order was always 1, 2, 4, 3 (you do get some speed modifying gear later on though).\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\nAll in all, I played the game for its educational part, I am really satisfied, the price is right, I will most definitely play the other 2 games of the same developer involving Katakana and soon Kanji.\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-", "timestamp_created": 1521660170, "timestamp_updated": 1521660568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40957533": {"recommendationid": "40957533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068976995", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 274, "last_played": 1521557799}, "language": "english", "review": "This game makes the classic gimmick of \"play and learn\" that most kids hated when it was forced on them for school, and it's definetely focused on just making you learn japanese symbols, and it's only sprinkled with JRPG's details to be presented in such a format that atracts a diferent demographic... yet... it managed to capture this certain charisma and grace on it's ridiculous plot to a point that it's enjoyable, funny, and even interesting (if you learn to take it less seriously at least).\n\nThe game presents itself with the plot of a traditional turn based JRPG, as a, per say, a 2D Final Fantasy, with a main character living in a forgotten town where some day a villain arrives trying to conquer them, and our character is the unsuspected hero that's up for beating badies, until they find out that the enemies are.... japanese symbols inmune to all damage unless you know their meaning!... the usual, right?... and so the game stablishes a mechanic that forces you to learn if you want to advance, and has all quests revolving around this, adding a new set of symbols slowly so you don't get overwhelmed, and some grammar details and sugestions that help you understanding.\n\nThe artistic concept is rather simple and not very impressive, but provides with a distinctive apearance for each character you play, areas, npcs and everything else in a good measure. As for the plot story, it isn't very original or creative, but does just enough to work with a character that fights written symbols for a living.\n\nAt the end this game delievers what it promises, it will teach you basic japanese, and if you go with the flow and don 't cheat your way through, you'll be obligated to learn the full set of Hiragana characters, the numbers, some basic phrases and nouns if you want to be able to beat it.

But the lessons can be intense and overwhelming. But that's just how the japanese language is. \n\nHiragana is the most basic levels of their language. It doesn't prepare you for everything, but it's a great place to start. Then follow it up with Kanji. The Japanese educational system states that in order to be literate in Japanese (or Nihon Go), you need to know at least two-thousand characters. Kanji was formed using Chinese characters to reduce the need for large banners and signs in Japan. During each lesson, you have some practice to do first. I highly recommend not skimping on the practice if you're serious about learning Japanese. And daily review is critical. As the saying goes, \"if you don't use it, you lose it.\" \n\nJust think back to something you used to do well but haven't done in a while (years). You'll find your skills to be rusty at best. Even if you just look at the characters once a day and say the sounds & words out loud, you'll keep it fresh in your mind, at least enough to pick it up when you get involved with Japanese again.\n\nI would most certainly recommend the game. Practice makes perfect and it can help a lot. And not just learning Japanese.\n\nAs of this post, the same game but with Kanji, the main written language in Japan, has yet to be released, but when it does, get it.", "timestamp_created": 1519423060, "timestamp_updated": 1519423060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40146255": {"recommendationid": "40146255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094326432", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498691536}, "language": "english", "review": "I learn to read.", "timestamp_created": 1518845362, "timestamp_updated": 1518845362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40145191": {"recommendationid": "40145191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321410889", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 289, "last_played": 1521006285}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this game to help me learn Japanese.

a classic RTS game with an emphasis on its in-depth unit building and strategy elements. Units are your typical land/sea/air types but they come with the deepest unit build tree I've seen in an RTS game to date. In addition to these units, the game considers physics, including wind speed and gravity, as relevant factors affecting unit performance which was not attempted in RTS games prior to this title. Resources boil down to collecting metal and energy (yes, just those two) and one will need as much of them as fast as possible for victory. I can't attest for the multiplayer elements as I'm only a casual who tried several of the single-player campaigns however; there is still a community present for those who love a good multiplayer match. The only shortcoming I found was in the \"story\" and how it was presented in the game... *spoiler*[spoiler] it essentially boils down to completely annihilating the opposing side at any cost [/spoiler].

I still even have my original CD-ROM. For the base asking price of $4.99, you really can't go wrong.\n\nThe premise is simple: you start off with a single Commander unit. With this solitary unit, you must construct resource-acquiring structures that supply you with two types of currency - metal and energy, both of which are vitally important for different reasons. With this supply of resources, you must build factories that construct units such as tanks, bots, planes, ships, hovercraft, etc. At this point, the game grows in complexity as battles are fought, factions expand their territory, and new technologies become available. Oftentimes, the objective is to elimate the enemy commander(s), but this can be customized. \n\nOne of the main draws of this game for me is the extremely generous unit cap. While it is common for RTS games to have a unit cap limiting you to perhaps a few dozen units at most, Total Annihilation allows hundreds, if not thousands, of units to be on the field at any one time. If I am not mistaken, it is also possible to use a mod to remove the unit cap entirely. \n\nFurthermore, the game has hundreds of different maps to chose from. Some are inhospitable and molten, others are freezing wastelands, while others yet are rather pleasant with lakes and rolling hills that are green with life...until the fighting begins.\n\nThere are also hundreds of units to construct, with many more available to add via mods. These units range from stealth planes to stationary cannons to laser-wielding spider robots and everything in-between.\n\nNot only this, but there's even a campaign available if you so wish.\n\nI could go on and on, but my point is that this game has a massive amount of content available and if you don't mind something on the older side, it is absolutely worth picking up for $4.99 (or less if you get it on sale).", "timestamp_created": 1513461350, "timestamp_updated": 1513461413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38319597": {"recommendationid": "38319597", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005228777", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514784443}, "language": "english", "review": "Game won't open.

Even though this game came out in 1997, it still brings a level of fun and strategy that isn't seen in many games that came after it. I still come back to it every once in a while, though not nearly as often as I used to, and relive the fun of crushing the filthy Core with endless waves of Flash tanks and Brawler planes. In recent times, my dad has stopped playing, and my younger brother never had as much fun with it as I did, but I still like to play a few matches here and there. I'm a purist when it comes to this game, and the most additional content I've installed has been the 3.1c patch and final 6 official Cavedog units.

It's worth it.\nTotal Annihilation.\nDamn.\nThis game was my childhood. I remember sitting on my Dad's lap and we'd build up our army together and then nuke the CORE to pieces. Those were the days.\nTotal Annihilation is a Real-Time Strategy game. You start off with one 'Unit', your Commander, and slowly build up your army of planes, vehicles, mechs, boats, hovercraft, etc. For a game that is 20 years old this year this is STILL in my opinion the greatest RTS game of all time. This is the type of game that despite the graphics being massively outdated, and only 1.1GB big (not even that), it's still feels full of content. The maps are HUGE and there's lots of variety. The Units all have their own jobs and characteristics. There's a campaign too, and also, if you can figure out how to get it to work, a multiplayer. At the time of writing this review it only says I have 2.1 hours on record, but to be truthful I probably have hundereds outside of Steam. This game is truly one of my favourite games of all time and I HIGHLY reccomend it to anybody who's into the Supreme Commander series. This is similar to Planetary Annihilation in that it was made by a few of the same people, but from what I've heard from Planetary Annihilation, despite being more modern, better in graphical design and including much more content, THIS is the game you want. Trust me.\n\nThanks for reading my review of Total Annihilation.

limitations.\nA lot of people who are not long time RTS fans will probably get turned off by this game, just from looking at it.\nI do, however, encourage people to play this game.\n\nThis game is still to this day years, decades even, ahead of it's time.\nFrom the notion of destroyed unit husks blocking unit movement, to the sheer scale of how powerful simple units can be.\nAnd for once in an RTS I actually feel like an Experimental unit, is Experimental.\nThe Krogoth is an amazing unit that, while yes, does take a long time to build, can dish out serious firepower, however unlike Experimental units of today it is not Nigh-on invincible, and can die reletively easily, but can quickly pave the way for an army.\nThe one big downside to the Krogoth is that only the CORE can build it, so if you're the ARM, you might want to build up your artillery.\nAlthough you'll probably never reach the point of actually building the Krogoth since it does take a considerable amount of time to build.\n\nThe game also has a booming soundtrack, composed by the one and only Jeremy Soule, who also composed the music for Elder Scrolls, Guild Wars and other hit/Cult Classic titles.\nVery few composers such as Soule actually still compose today.\nFrank Klepaki is one such artist, alough his Command and Conquer work, will probably still be his best.\n\nThe only game that I could recommend to ever coming close to TA, is probably Dark Reign, and even that doesn't come anywhere near the level this game produced.\n\nPros:\n-The game is quite fluid, and offers quite a great deal of control over your units.\n-The future setting works in its favor instead of against it (Even to this day).\n-The music is masterfully crafted to suit the game's tone and ambition.\n-The art is quite unique and no 2 units look the same.\n-One of the very few RTS of its time to use more than 1 resource and be balanced\n-Maps are expertly crafted so that no one position feels, acts, or is the same.\n-Terrain actually plays a role in the game's combat.\n-Buildings actually have a wide degree of rotation (For the most part).\n\nCons:\n-The game's flidity can be hindered by unexpected obstacles (UI, terrain, etc.).\n-While the art is incredibly unique, I do understand that it is a bit dated, namely how units and structures act.\n-Having 2 resources also means having more to protect in specific locations.\n-Asymmetry can lead to many problems on some of the maps, such as spawns.\n-Terrain is nice, but the tiniest of bumps can make a well planned base fall apart (So be very careful and wary)\n-Yes buildings have a surprising amount of rotation, however construction buildings can only be placed one way with minor rotation when placed.\n\nThe game also came with a map editor and a ridiculous player system, both of which were not great.\nBuilding maps was a chore, and had many placement issues.\nThe player count required 4 extra copies if you wanted to take advantage of all 8 player slots.\n\nTA Kingdoms improved on both of those features, but was unfortunately the bastard child, to many people, of the franchise.\nAlthough I quite liked Kingdoms, I just feel like it had too many units, and could have been better.\n\nOverall I give Total Annihilation a 10/10.\nNot even the flaws can keep me from loving this Masterpiece of \"Ahead of its time\"

With the exception of UI flaws this game is actually able to stand the test of time. Which is quite rare for a RTS game.

While you have a stock amount of metal and Energy this will quickly go away if you can't keep up with the demand and when it hits bottom things will take far longer to build.\n\nThe two sides have similar units on Tier 1 but on Tier 2 they vary a bit. But most units can be useful later on. Arm are the best looking though. Just a fact.\n\nWith mods installed you can build up to 1000 per player but that generally just crashes the game so keep to 500 per player. The AI can't really handle this amount either as they'll do stupid things like building 100 Metal extractors instead of Moho Mines on a metal planet.\nYou'll also get conga lines of enemies towards your base and these lines can be pretty long and pretty big. For instance with 1000 units on that line is just one long line from the enemy base to my base. Or rather to the range of my turrets.\n\nThere are plenty of unit mods for this game and you'll be needing some programs in order to use them all. But there is still a limit on how many you can have.\n\nIf you decide to play online you can limit how many units the AI can build of certain things and this can be used to stop them from building a ton of useless structures.

This is one of those few games that is still playable today, it has a big variety of units from land, sea, and air to choose from and can change the outcome of the game.  The units are 3D modeled on a 2D interface, and there are units that the TA community have built that can be inserted into the game to increase the types of units and structures that you can build.  A person/persons put together a mod that can be used with TA that makes changes to the games interface and includes new units and defense structures to make the game more interesting.   There are those people that will complain about the graphics, but the graphics are still fine, you can tell what the units are supposed to be and there is still detail on the units themselves, it's not like they are just flat Atari tanks and planes moving around.  I own many RTS games, this is still one of the best ones out there that has good balance and a slew of things to make, not to mention the patrol system is still ahead of many modern games.  One of the cool things of today is that this game can be played using huge maps and 1000+ units/buildings and still run great due to todays processors.  If you enjoy huge battles that will force you to make various things to win, then this is a game for you, but if you like your star craft and like to build few things and rely on specific units, then you best stick to your star craft type games.", "timestamp_created": 1481408606, "timestamp_updated": 1481408606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500898", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28284757": {"recommendationid": "28284757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279831936", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514027905}, "language": "french", "review": "le jeu peut tournez sur la plupart des pc moyen \n\nle jeu est genial est libre \n\nia tres competente\n\net plein d autre qualitez", "timestamp_created": 1481360251, "timestamp_updated": 1497170463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28246834": {"recommendationid": "28246834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002499257", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481161025}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't need steam playtime to review this game, this game was my damn childhood.

things about Total Annihilation (specifically, the Steam version) that make me not want to recommend the game are listed below:\n\n  \u2022 The available screen size is very limited compared to modern successors. It makes finding enemy units firing from far off screen very difficult, and base management as well.\n  \u2022 The command interface is split across several pages, and is non-intuitive compared to modern games but also compared to some of its contemporaries (Age of Empires, Warcraft 2, Command & Conquer: Red Alert, etc.)\n  \u2022 The unit movement and structure placement is very finicky -- once again, this is based upon my comparisons to modern RTS games of its kind, but watching a robot spend several (5+) seconds walking into a wall isn't as entertaining as you might think.\n  \u2022 Also, I felt that several of the campaign missions are very unbalanced, but your opinion may differ on this point.\n\nTherefore, it was a good game during its heyday when it was fresh and introduced new and novel features to RTS games, but I can't recommend it now.\n\n(P.S.

Answer, I've been told it does but alas life is a hinderance to LAN parties these days. \n\nAlso, all the DLC is included. Including the annoying bugs that needed to be fixed for a modern gamer.\n\nSo, the game is still awesome, but skimish AI is a bit basic. The campaign AI can be a bit errrr.... cruel. Some times the AI wil throw everything they have at you on the first scheduled attack. Don't get me wrong, it makes me laugh but can be annoying. lol. Also, game does not autosave so remember to save after missions. \n\nLastly, one thing that I forgot until i started playing this again... units will not fire on targets within range but have not be sighted. i.e on radar. Its a odd annoyance but its there to stop capture targets being destoryed by AI. So if it happens, likely it was your fault :)\n\nAnyway for the price, freaking bargain.

While parts of it can feel dated today, the basic mechanics, gameplay, and the epic score still hold their own nearly 20 years later. I first bought this game barely a month after release, back in the beforetime of 1997, and it's been perpetually on my favorite games of all time list since then. At a time when Starcraft was dominating the RTS market, Total Annihilation was providing an alternative to the small scale clickfest style of gameplay that Starcraft ushered in, offering large maps, epic battles, physics-based combat, and some truly memorable moments. Why throw a dozen marines at something when you can command a hundred-plus giant robots and tanks to obliterate everything in their path?\n\nThe game definitely had and still has its faults - players unfamiliar with the game are going to be confused by the relative sameness of some of the units, and the sheer numbers of them available to build. It also featured an active use economy; the first of its kind that I'm aware of - I personally love it, but it does entail quite a learning curve from the classic Dune II/Age of Empires \"spend it when you build it\" model. Some of the larger maps are also not for the faint of heart - while eventually outdone by Supreme Commander, the larger TA maps can take literally hours of multiplayer slug-matches to end a game, particularly once you bump up the unit count to something a modern computer can sink its teeth into.\n\nIn the end though, it's said that an amateur thinks in terms of strategy, while a professional thinks in terms of logistics - and that's absolutely the case here, where you can spend yourself into inaction, or use the shattered remains of your opponents' armies to fuel your own war machine.", "timestamp_created": 1480268409, "timestamp_updated": 1480268409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27859927": {"recommendationid": "27859927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004742585", "num_games_owned": 405, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480267712}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the greatest RTS games of all time.

I first got this game long before it was available on Steam, and for me it's a classic.  For me, this game set the standard for games I like.  This was one of the first games I've ever played on PC, and it is FUN!\n\nAnd this is a GREAT DEAL for it: The whole game plus its Expansions/DLC's for $5?  But enough of my rambling praise, let get into WHY it is sooo good.\n\nFirst off, a bit of history: this game made it.  This was the first game to feature the concept of 3D terrain.  It set a precedent for RTS games in that regard.  To this day, even after its creators went out of business (RIP Cavedog), it still has an active community and modding fanbase.\n\nWhat makes this game so fun for me is, remarkably, its simplicity.  The game is very straight-forward, so there isn't much of a learning curve to worry about.  All you need to learn are some basic tactics, base defense skills, and then watch as your enemy explodes. #NukesForDays\nSkirmishes can add new dynamics/entertainment to the game.  The only point of frustration here is that when it comes to their own bases, the AI are not the brightest (but then again, they're pretty good for something from the mid-90's!).\n\nIn short, Do you enjoy watching things explode?

The odds of the machine arriving with Total Annihilation on it's hard drive however seem incredible to me in hindsight. Of course initially, we, a 7-, 4- and 3-year-old didn't have much of a clue what we were doing playing this game, but I reckon by the time I was 10 or so I started getting better, reaching higher campaign missions. Never had the skill to complete the game back then though and I spent most of the time nuking the AI player on a random map with infinite metal, which was great fun in itself.\n\nShortly before writing this review, I didn't know TA won Game of the Year in 1997, or even that it was made in 1997, but replaying this classic really made me realize why I was less impressed than my peers with later titles like Age of Empires 2 or Command & Conquer. TA had simply done so much better before them and I knew of it. I kid you not, Total Annihilation would be a strong title if it was released today. The mechanics of destruction feel so satisfying. Even the graphics don't look too bad. Most of today's titles cannot match it's diversity of units. TA had a pseudo-3D world where hills obstruct artillery fire, unit task queues and radar almost 20 years ago and I haven't even seen a similar veteran unit mechanic since.

Probably going to end up spending hundreds of hours playing this game again just like when I was a kid.\n\nPros: \n+Both expansion packs automatically included\n+Map editor\n+Supports larger screen sizes\n+Ver 3.1, compatible with tons of community mods / custom units and maps\n+Working perfectly fine with windows 10\n+Nostalgia boner if you've played the game before\n+It has this unique feel to it. Idk how to really explain it, but, after playing other RTS games, I've never got the same feel with them as I have to this game.\n+Probably the spark of what started my robot love as a child\n+I'm just pulling extra pros to make the game look even better to other people\n+Edited Pro: Works perfectly with other modded version of TA (like what i mentioned above) after doing the community updates for the game, however doesn't clock hours since they run on a separate .exe. Been playing tons of  TA: Escalation\n\n\nCons: (most of these can probably be fixed with community mods anyway, haven't actually looked yet)\n-With larger screen sizes, the hud gets super tiny because of it. Probably cause the game wasn't originally made for sizes that large\n-Cap on custom units. I personally don't find it that big of an issue but some people may.\n-Steam overlay doesn't work\n-Multiplayer functions not updated\n-Upon launching, smashes all my opened windows into a small corner  on a single monitor.

As an example, I tend to play with multiple static long range artillery bases, using anti-air defence to protect the assets and scout aircraft to look for things to crush.  However, if you like tanks (you do right?) then you can build a sexy amount of them and ram them down the enemies throat.  You'll loose more units, but it's way more satisfying than building fire bases.\n\nYou only have 2 resources (metal and enery), so thats easy to master.  There are land, sea, sub-sea and air units, as well as structures that provide various functions.

Make sure you get the latest patch, and NOT one of the archived cracked totalA.exe files for various max unit caps. These don't work with the Steam version of the game.\n\nAs downloaded from Steam, the game defaults to 250 units and there is no TotalA.ini file, so you'd have to make (or DL) one before you could change to the OTA supported max unit cap of 500 units. However, if this was all you did, then more often than not, the game will crash when both sides are at max units and the fur is starting to fly, and this will happen regardless of whether you have max cap setting of 250 or 500.\n\nAs soon as I replaced the default version of TotalA.exe with the version of TotalA.exe included in the 1500 unit patch from TA Universe, the game consistently crashed at random times. This happened several times, even though I was within 500 total units at the time. I tried disabling Direct Sound and used Windows sound instead, but the result was exactly the same. Sound isn't the issue.\n\nMy system is Windows 7 x64bit with a relatively old Nvidia GeForce GTX 750Ti graphics card. I have the latest patch from TA Universe installed and three mods installed.

For those that don't, let's just say a 500 unit cap was \"small\" to us.[/spoiler]\n\nTechnical aspects aside, it is still a decent port and truly a game worthy of giving a look over. A rare gem of an RTS that was revolutionary back in a time dominated by Starcraft and Command & Conquer.

This steam version is a stable build, i am using OS windows 10 and had no issue's to deal with.\nIf you are not fammiliar with this game but you like retro rts games or like the subcom franchise and want to know where it came from BUY IT. For new players it can be a sort of stuggle to get into the game since there is no totorial, i advice to just play the campaign on easy first, you will have enough time to understand the mechanics and units. Try to play the campaign on normal or hard to get a real challenge, the NPC will spam alot more units to destroy and the battlefield will result in a massive clusterf**k wich is nice... \n\nGood luck comrades!", "timestamp_created": 1453381322, "timestamp_updated": 1476795001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20653035": {"recommendationid": "20653035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012312412", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467903552}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best new MOBAS  of the year!\n2016..NOT AT ALL TO BE CONFUSED WITH 1997.\ni'M DRUNK.", "timestamp_created": 1453341597, "timestamp_updated": 1453341597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20618999": {"recommendationid": "20618999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071689130", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453840163}, "language": "english", "review": "the one game were both sides are kind of assholes the core basically downloads people into robot bodys flipping the natural order the middle finger and the arm dabble in cloning and genetic modification. there are no good guys just a millenium old moral disagreement that got ugly fast.", "timestamp_created": 1453183269, "timestamp_updated": 1453183269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20612820": {"recommendationid": "20612820", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994258811", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452628870}, "language": "french", "review": "L'\u00e9cole du STR avec Starcraft et C&C.\n\nPrecurseur dans beaucoup de domaines:\n- Grande carte\n- Utilisation de terrain\n- Les carcasses restent.

Now OTA is here on Steam in all its glory! It wasnt Starcraft or Command & Conquer that set the bar for late 90s rts games. OTA is the undisputed and most refferenced old-school RTS that to this day inspires the finer qualities in the EPIC War genre we crave.\n\nIts important to note *though steam failed to mention it in the product details* This edition includes all DLC along with the main game (Original Total Annihilation, Core contengency Expansion, All of the Battle Tactics Expansions, Bonus Maps, Bonus Official Cavedog Units, Patch 3.1 known as the \"No CD Patch\" Patch 3.1 also is tweaked with the expanded unit cap which can be modified in the system files to a maximum of 5000 units per player in a 10 player battle. updated and fully supported multiplayer hosting for matches complete with thier own communities... The Added bennefit of the Steam Edition is access to the steam community for multiplayer compatibility. by comparison it is identical to the GOG edition with exception that the steam version has better compatibility with modern windows OS. Both copies work seamlessly with Wine if you use Linux or Mac. I reccomend the Steam edition for ease of gaming with friends. but the GOG.com version is DRM Free meaning you can buy one copy and then gift as many as you want to your friends per thier TOS agreement.\n\n-----Some useful details about the game not mentioned in the description-----\n\nMinor Bug: Due to this being a rather ancient game... there is an issue with the screen rendering of the game for flat screens which will cause a periodic flicker. Alt Tab didnt exist back then either so you should press the Windows key to minimise your game if you wish to chat with your steam buddies outside of the game. This however has an issue where the the screen will tweak out into odd colors... just minimize and maximize a couple times and the emulator steam uses to run the game will adjust and fix the issue pretty reliably. This is caused by the change in formatting for video displays after the flat screen transition.\n\nSome Extra Stuff:\n\nby default the multiplayer loby should have this enabled due to game additions added for both the GOG.com & Steam versions of the game. If you accidently shrink your lobby down or it appears as the old default of maximum of 4 players for skirmish and multi, simply press the 8 key on your keyboard followed by the roman numeral key from 2 to 10 indicating the max player matches. so 2 would be \"8 ii\" while 10 would be \"8 x\".\n\nto enter a \"console code\" while playing multiplayer or skirmish game modes simply press Enter and type + followed by the command. (The older versions of the game allowed some console commands to work in single player but the 3.1 patch made many commands nonfunctional or were removed all together. Many of these commands are now only availible within the develloper mode which you will need to download from TAUniverse & other fansites. It is possible to reinable them by editing the configuration files but the engine will not allow you to play multiplayer with other clients that have different files then you.)\n\nsome useful console commands are +gamma, +contour, & +showranges. These dont really break gameplay and fully function in all gamemodes, so enabling cheats to use these functions is ok if you agree with your gamemates that they can be used.\n\n+gamma lets you adjust the brightness of the screen \"+gamma 8.5\" was default for the old tube monitors... you can play around with this if you have lighting issues. \n\n+contour is useful for seeing the 3D terrain elivations and is highly useful as nobody back then had a concept of strategic zoom like what was introduced by Supreme Commander. +contour 5 is best i think as it still lets you view the pretty terrain features while letting you put that factory on the perfect spot easier. type +contour with no number to remove the elivation overlay. if you put a value in decimal that is less then one you will need to place a zero before the decimal for it to register... note this can cause framerate loss or artificial slowdown of the game for really minor details. in case of a game crash you will need to reinstall yourgame if you input values lower then 0.045.\n\n+showranges indicates the ranges of the various weapons on mobile units. it doesnt work on fixed fortifications which was fixed when they included the same feature in Supreme Commander. By default all units have an explosion range where they will harm other units within that range... and most units have 1 - 2 weapon ranges which might be off screen if its a long ranged weapon. some specdial units will by default have other indicators depending on functionality such as a cloak or stealth/jammer field that should be enabled by default.\n\na neat feature on the main menu is to type \"dxdeath\" which will enable or disable a Cavedog logo in the lower middle of the menuscreen. if you click that... in the old days it would allow you to view the credit screen... also while enabled it would allow you to manually pick missions rather then unlocking missions as you played.\n\n--another 2 codes that are neat but may become annoying for various reasons are +sing & +dither.\n\n+sing replaces the vehical sounds of units with a guy singing some nonsensical toon.\n\n+dither changes the gray scale of the out of view zones in the game to a \"dithered\" or bug-screen colored view. it looked great on the old analog tube monitors but causes major flickering issues on modern digital flatscreens. DO NOT USE THIS IF YOU HAVE EPILEPSY or are at risk for seizures or taking medications with this risk (regular gameplay on flatscreens however is completely safe)... there is no warning for this feature as this game predates those videogame warnings by like 10 years.", "timestamp_created": 1452296071, "timestamp_updated": 1452296071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.795255", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20405022": {"recommendationid": "20405022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070699893", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453349154}, "language": "english", "review": "*Me on Battle.net thinking of opening up starcraft*\n*Decide to browse the steam store for the hell of it*\n*Do a double take when I see Total Annihilation is finally on Steam*\n*Deletes Battle.net*\n*Buys the shit out of Total Annihilation*\n*Enjoys the awesome nostalgia trip of the first and best RTS game I've ever played*", "timestamp_created": 1452285408, "timestamp_updated": 1452285408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 71, "votes_funny": 43, "weighted_vote_score": "0.801848", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20401984": {"recommendationid": "20401984", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983947879", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454234802}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich habe dieses Spiel fr\u00fcher geliebt und bis heute habe ich auch noch die CD-Version.

This is a game I like to remember as being one of the best RTS games ever. Being released in the late 90s it came out amongst other great RTS games like, Starcraft, Warcraft 2, Red Alert, Command and Conquer and Age of Empires. Back then the RTS competition was a tough one to beat and Total Annihilation proved it could be on top with the rest of them. Its gameplay is smooth, it works and its easy to learn.\nThe resources in this game are Energy and Metal, and the resource gathering is different but works in the case of Income and Loss. Your income will be determined by things such as how many solar collectors you have for energy, and how many metal deposits you are collecting from. You always want to aim for your income to higher than your loss at all times even when you're building, this way you can almost avoid any loss in resources all together. The best way to explain this is like this; Max Metal and Energy at the start is 1000 in stores, A barracks could cost 500 metal and 2350 energy, the game will decide how much you will lose per second that its being built, so youre income of metal might be 5.4, and energy is 111 you're loss might then be 6.2 and 120 so you will start to lose these resources over time and could run out of energy before its finished you avoid this by building more energy collectors to make the income of energy much higher and then not run out of energy in the middle of building.\nMost of the gameplay exists around your one main builder unit, The Commander, this guy builds all your buildings and gathers temporary resources (of which btw is pretty much everything, you can gather trees and folliage for energy. Rocks and whats left of units are gathered as metal.). That being said however, once your base is built up and your income of resources is good, is where you start to build your massive robotic army of your infantry, vehicles and aircraft. There is no population cap so you build as much as you like. Through reading everything that is said about the units and buildings you'll be able to find a good mix of what you need nice and easy. \nPros: -Quick Gameplay\n- Gameplay makes sense and works\n- Robot Armies\n- A different type of resource collecting not seen often\n- A long story driven campaign\n- Pretty much everything explodes\nCons: - its from the 90s so graphics will be out dated\n- Resources might get annoying to keep at a steady rate", "timestamp_created": 1451135018, "timestamp_updated": 1451135018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19961399": {"recommendationid": "19961399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138218754", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458237856}, "language": "french", "review": "Culte !

Despite the ease of being able to get into the game and just start playing, there is a wide variety of units that allow an incredible level of complex creativity in terms of strategy. Total Annihilation is like eating candy without the calories: it gives you a cool robot army, huge explosions, and probably one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard composed for a game.\n\nTotal Annihilation is also very mod-friendly and customizable. \n\nDespite being a great game, there are some pitfalls: Getting a multiplayer game can be tricky if you have no idea what you're doing. You will need to connect to the ip address of the host, which most modern games do for you automatically. Additionally, there is a unit cap of 250 (which includes buildings) that you *can* increase, but you have to manually edit the totala.ini file. This can be a pain in the butt for the computer-challenged, but isn't difficult to actually do. \n\nThe main complaint I hear about this game is the pathfinding. And I agree. Sometimes your units will do what seem to be nonsensical things, like trying to drive up a wall instead of going around it. Very large armies also have difficulty moving around, and the units tend to get stuck on each other. Naval units are the best example of this, where they will grind against each other trying to find their way to a destination. There ARE pathfinding patches out there that will significantly help with these difficulties, though.\n\nOverall, this is a great game.

Alle versuche es in einer Virtuellen Maschine zu Starten waren vergebens, wenn man mit der \"Core-Offensive\" und \"Battle Tactic\" (hier mit enthalten) spielen wollte. Es fehlte in der Virtuellen Maschine wie unter Win7 einfach die 16bit Unterst\u00fctzung zur Installation der Add-Ons.\nDank Steam ist diese Zeit nun vorbei und man kann das Game wieder richtig und in vollen z\u00fcgen genie\u00dfen.\n\nAuch wer kein gutes Englisch kann, aber die Deutsche Version von damals gespielt hat, wird sich ohne probleme im Game zurecht finden.\nUnd noch zwei gute Nachrichten: \n- die Befehlskonsole nimmt auch hier die Cheats von f\u00fcher an (so kann man zum Beispiel seinen Comander zum Singen bekommen ;) auch wenn er immer nur das selbe vorsich hin dudelt)\n- sowie der Unit-Patch auch ausf\u00fchrbar ist.\nWer also diese Dinge noch sein \"eigen\" nennen kann, hat wieder soviel Spa\u00df wie fr\u00fcher.\n\nKurz und knapp zum Spiel: \nEs geht um den Kamp zweier fortschritlichen und mechanischen V\u00f6lker die sich seit langen bek\u00e4mpfen. Du schl\u00fcpfst als Commander in einer der Rollen und musst dich zu Lande, Luft und Wasser (je nach Karten Wahl) mit knappen Recourcen gegen deinen Gegner behaupten und Ihn vernichten. Hier ist planerisches Geschick f\u00fcr die Geb\u00e4ude und vermehrung der Recourcen genauso gefragt wie eine gute Taktik um den Gegner in die Knie zu zwingen.\nIhr k\u00f6nnt dabei die Seite auf der Ihr K\u00e4mpfen wollt frei w\u00e4hlen. Auf diese Art viele Missionen (\u00fcber die man das Game auch kennenlernt) meistern oder im Freien Spiel mit bis zu drei KI Gegnern k\u00e4mpfen. Das Spiel bietet auch hier die Multi-Player Unterst\u00fctzung (habe ich noch nicht getestet), so k\u00f6nnt Ihr auch gegen reale Gegner antreten oder z.B. zu zweit gegen die KI antretten. Drei Schwierigkeitsstufen sind einstellbar.\n\n\u00dcber das Spiel: \n\u00dcberragend war die damalige M\u00f6glichkeit des Spiels alle Geb\u00e4ude frei bauen zu k\u00f6nnen wo man wollte, es gibt nur hinsichtlich vorhandener Hindernissen auf der Karte oder derem Rand eine kleine Einschr\u00e4nkung. Man kann also keine Geb\u00e4ude auf den Kartenrand oder gar halb auf die Hindernisse setzten. Die Truppen die man Baut, lassen sich frei bewegen, alleine oder in Gruppen (die man wiederum frei zusammen stellen kann). Und auch wenn man nur von Oben auf das Spielfeld blickt, erkennt man dank der guten Darstellung und den damaligen 3D Effekten sehr gut die Unterschiede von den Geb\u00e4uden, Fahrzeugen, Hindernissen u.s.w.. Viele der Hindernisse geben hier die M\u00f6glichkeit (je nach Karte) den Gegner gezielt in eine Falle laufen zu lassen, da man auch Verteidigungsanlagen auf diese bauen kann. Klar ist auch, das der Gegner diese auch ausschalten kann, wenn er Sie erstmal ausgemacht hat. Von einfachen Aufkl\u00e4rungs- Fahrzeugen/Robotern bis hin zur EMP-Bombe ist alles dabei.\n\nZu guter Letzt:\nDanke sagen m\u00f6chte ich dem Steam Team, die dieses absolute Kult-Game mit in die Reihen aufgenommen haben. Sowie den Herrschaften die es erm\u00f6glicht haben mit Hilfe der Steam Plattform es auch auf neueren Systemen spielen zu k\u00f6nnen.

Since WHEN does a building count as a unit? In pretty much every RTS ever made, a unit is MOBILE, a character or vehicle with combat, constructive, or special abilities. Buildings are STATIONARY. They typically do nothing to defend your base and are used for production purposes. So, let's say you're expanding your base, fighting tooth and claw for metal, building solar complexes and also building DEFENSES to PROTECT what you've had to fight hard for. Laser towers on resource spots, production buildings abroad so you can deploy forces from key locations. Well guess what? This whole time you've been expanding your base, you have been taking space from your COMBAT UNITS. \n\nThere is a UNIT CAP. So now, if you do have an expanded base, there's a good chance the enemy has a larger fighting force than you and regardless of whether you attack or wait to be attacked, you'll take heavy casualties and the enemy will sense this and just overwhelm you with a larger army. Oh and the game DOESN'T tell you how close you're getting to the unit cap. So you basically have to finely tune the production of everything or else you might waste an hour and a half because your fighting units are crippled by the unit cap. This is the issue I've found in campaign and it's kind of horse s***.\n\nIn closing, why does a game called TOTAL ANNIHILATION, which is about the mass production of combat robots between two factions who have been hating each other for 400 years have this cap? It's like putting a diaper on a grizzly bear. Wherever we look, sentient robots are a HUGE problem. Terminator: the whole damn planet has been overrun with machines. Mass Effect: THE WHOLE F****** UNIVERSE is about to be destroyed by machines. Robots bring two things when they attack, firepower and numbers. In a game like Age of Empires it makes sense. Want to train more troops and villagers? You need more houses/castles for your people to shelter in.

You'll thank me later...) \n\nDespite being an old game it works great in Windows 10 with no compatibilty problems or issues.

"Loved TA back in the day and was very happy to see it land on Steam. It is one of my all time favorites.\n\nThe only downside is that there is a glitch when running the game from Steam for the first time. For me it was an easy fix (as described below).\n\nIf you're ok with doing a one-time workaround, then definitely go purchase this game. Otherwise, I\u2019d wait a little while. The game was recently released and I\u2019m sure it will be fixed fairly soon.\n\nSo here\u2019s the problem and my fix. Keep in mind that this worked for me and may not work for everyone!\n\nProblem: \nWhen launching TA for the first time through Steam, I kept getting \u201cError: Environment initialization failed! Check your DirectX\u201d\n\nThe Fix:\nLaunched the game directly by running TotalA.exe.

I still strongly prefer the original over the more spiritual-successor, Planetary Annihilation.\n\nTotal Annihilation features so many small features that just make it amazing, the battles can be huge and intense with massive amounts of units having a huge Warhammer 40k esque fight all on one screen, or the games can be slow and brilliantly thought out. This is a strategy game where you can win purely by 'defensive' play at times, something I find to be rather unique among a lot of strategy games that even today have rather narrow methods to win, usually by just having the larger and better offensive force, but not always in Total Annihilation. \n\nA feature that makes Total Annihilation so unique is the true emphasis on a defensive playstyle, if you so desire. There are an impressive amount of options for defensive, slow play styles and faster, more offensive playstyles alike. You can choose to hunker down and improve your economy while building a large amount of turrets and upgrading to better ones over the course of the game, some are even capable of bombarding your opponent from the entire maps length, assuming you reach the demanding level of tech and economy required for them. Even tactical nukes can be constructed and launched over a map away if the game length and level of sustainable economy is reached. This allows for a lot of options for a lot of different types of players. There is also no real super demanding macro-memory required \u00e0 la StarCraft II, making the game just a bit more accessable to newer players, especially in more team oriented game modes.\n\nThe game also features incredible physics for it's more 2.5 dimensional, isometric strategy experience. One of my favourite things about this game is seeing things like unit inaccuracy, especially when on the move or on unstable ground or even when taking pot-shots at something through the fog-of-war. Units will have better vision when on the high ground and worse vision when in a trench, making a lot of areas on maps incredibly strategic locations. There's even bullet physics, units will often adjust their aim higher or lower depending on the target, and when the steel corpses begin to litter the battlefield they will often block incoming rounds harmlessly while your units continue to trudge past the enemy fire. There's a gritty feeling seeing all your units charge an enemy fortified position only to begin seeing the missiles and rounds begin to rain down upon them and seeing a huge chunk of your force get obliterated by a large round, shaking the screen and sending chunks of steel flying in every direction, the steel \"gibs\" even damaging nearby units who get hit by them.\n\nThe game also features an amazing orchestral 'dynamic' music score written and composed by the one and only Jeremy Soule. The music really compliments an already fantastic game nicely, changing to a more brooding tone as you build up your base and switching to a more heart-pounding score as enemy fighters engage your army. It's an incredible soundtrack that you may even consider finding for your own music player. The sound design alone in this game is also very unique and give it a great distinct and 'mechanical' feel.\n\nIf there was one strategy that I think is criminally unknown to most people, this would have to be it.

And no need for mods to get 1080p or higher. As the game even back in 1997 did scale to your max windows resolutions, sadly the game UI don't. Nor the radar. So at 2K or 4K they are really tiny. And ofc this has the addon \"The Core Contingency\" and lots of other old bonus missions. And yes. I use Win10 and it works just fine. At the time of this writing the Arm campaing is done, 11 hours played and not a single crash.. \n\nThis game is equally great for turtle players and rushers alike. The SP campaign AI can be brutal on the attacks at times. But even a turtle player can focus on defenses and hold up until he is ready. Some of the maps are huge and will need some micro managing to get around well, but take your time and it will work out. There are tons of units to select from. So it will fit any style you have the more you progress in the story. I would recommend to google keyboard shortcuts, as there are a ton of then to make the game easier to handle. As the game set the standard for way point systems, so you can order a unit to move to the enemy base, attack a unit, fall back and patrol the base all in one way point go. Or set the commander to build a few buildings while you attack or scout.\n\n\nFor this price, even not on a discount. You would be foolish to skip this part of RTS history. It set the standards along with C&C for all time to come. Old or new RTS player, it won't take long to get into this gem. Even with the huge unit count. Only downside is that buildings count towards the unit cap at 200. But each unit counts as 1. Not 1 to 8 like in SC.\n\nHighly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1450650499, "timestamp_updated": 1511468536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.638706", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19813318": {"recommendationid": "19813318", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996473308", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453495055}, "language": "english", "review": "What a great blast from the past!

Looking back to the late 90s and the technology available then, this game was amazingly advanced and did many things that weren't at all common then. Many common RTS elements that are expected in a game released today can be seen in their youth in TA. The order queuing system, the streaming resource and building systems, the diversity of units and asymmetrical factions are all key features that were later used in practically every RTS since. You can clearly see the foundation of Supreme Commander especially. There are aspects of TA that still haven\u2019t been matched, such as the unit diversity: Air, Land, Sea, Seaplane, Hovercraft, Amphibious.\n\nLike artillery? How about the Intimidator, which can fire halfway across the map? Too slow? Build the Buzzsaw: a giant rotary cannon made up of Intimidators that fires as fast as a machine gun and will drain your energy economy in seconds. Yes, it IS the most entertaining gun ever!\n\nThe music of TA is the best orchestral soundtrack ever made for a game. I still sometimes listen to the \"battle\" tracks in my car. I turn the music off in every other game I\u2019ve played and listen to \u201creal\u201d music instead (I remember listening to Spice Girls on a CD while playing), but TA got to keep its soundtrack.\n\nI think a large part of what made TA such a fun and long lasting experience was the modding community. I remember spending as much time finding, downloading (V.90 modem, yo), and figuring out conflicts between mods as playing the game, but those mods extended the diversity and playability of the game so extensively that there are still active players AND active modders for TA. You don\u2019t see that with too many 19 year-old games.\n\nThe chief contender for the RTS throne was Starcraft, which was released right around the same time as TA, and went on to define the \"twitch\" RTS subgenre. Coming from Warcraft 2, I remember buying both games, and being rather disappointed in Starcraft, since it seemed to me to be \"Warcraft in space\".

BUYITRIGHTNOWGO\n\nI write this review holding my original copy of Total Annihilation in hand. But I'll just set it down, so I can type better. This game is what many other games have tried to emulate, but have failed in some aspect (looking mainly at YOU, Planetary Annihilation). It really should be able to please just about any RTS fan. Want a quick, in your face battle? You got it. Want a long war of attrition? Done (Play Seven Islands for an epic air/sea/nuke battle royale). The campaign is pretty solid too, from what I remember. \n\nThe music is what I remembered the most, I think. It was just so epic, and fit the game so perfectly. And, for a game that's pushing 20 years old, it still has a charming look to it, not too far off from some indie games released much later. Sometimes pathing can be a bit annoying, but when your units get stuck, just blast them with your Commander's D-gun, for instant gratification.\n\nI think really the only negative thing I can say, is that this version includes all the expansion(s). I felt the base game is awesome without the new units and such. Also, I can't help but notice that the AI had to have been tweaked in some ways. It's much more predictable with the xpacs, and dumbed down. It is nice they included the map editor though, sometimes it feels that the provided maps can get stale. That might also be from playing every map many, many times.\n\nCavedog was a pretty legit developer that just unfortunately got overwhelmed by a small market at that time period.

After hitting the 'single' button, press * and the corresponding roman numeral to the amount of players you want. Example: *X would bump the limit to 10.

You dont have to edit .ini files or use third party apps to get it running properly in fullscreen without glitches, apart from the above mentioned. For that alone it is worth a rebuy (because we cant really blame the original devs for not considering Windows 8 / 10 compatability, now can we?) :)\n\nThat said, I highly recommend people to immediately get some of the convenience mods / balance patches out there.\nIn some ways they are almost required to enjoy the game in a modern RTS mindset.\nSuch as being able to select groups with just pressing 1, instead of pressing Alt+1 which was ridiculous at that time, and is still highly user-unfriendly today.\nOr being able to hold and drag buildings when holding shift. Makes building walls feasible, which it wasnt in vanilla TA placing one at a time, click click click click.\n\nA great masterpiece of a game that DOES show its age due to some weird control schemes they opted for in the old days.\nBut with mods to modernize and \"logicalize\" the controls, it still holds up today, despite the awful pathfinding.\nThe pure atmosphere and \"feel\" of the game is still un-rivaled.

I have played this game so much, I don't think any other game can compare. The modding community at the time was crazy, tons of new options to add in. You can still find mods to this day. The first one was great but the expansions added so much more to the game. For its time this game was the Farcry of RTS, graphics were amazing, maps were never ending, and battles were not capped to 200 units per player. Game defaults to 1000 units, however patchs are available, or a simple edit of the config file to allow as many as you desire.\n\nWhen cavedog first offered their gaming service to connect players it was all I ever did.

Maybe it is just mine. Secondly change left click to right click in the menus if your used to other RTS. Game sound starts at mono and can be changes to 3D (Stereo). Options accessed only once you select single or multiple player. Options in game can be selected by pressing tab. Game I believe is auto paused on start for all maps. Resolution support works for 1080p but must be selected, most games at this time barely supported 1280x1028.\n \n While playing:\n Speed can be adjusted during single and multiple player via the + or - buttons. \n Multiple buildings can be queued together using shift.\n Resource sharing is possible with allies at set increments so you never have to constantly send resources.\n Building units also has an infinite queue. Holding shift increments 5. Left click to add units, right click to remove.\n Your commander has a gun called the D-Gun hot key is D, this is a huge blast that can one shot everything but a commander and expieremental units not in the original (later expansions).\n If your commander dies in campaign it is the end of the match, multiplayer depending on settings. Your commander blows up like a big nuke.\n Planes build the slowest, then Kbots, then vechicles. Forgot hover vechicles, but they are in an expansion as well.

I remember walking through Sam's Club back in 1997 and seeing the display for this game. A buddy of mine bought the game and told me you gotta see this game.

And because they didn't go straight to TA2, well, the rest is history. TA:K didn't do so well and the company eventually went under with no sequel ever done. The ownership has changed many times over (last I heard a company in Japan had it and wouldn't part with it) and a sequel does not seem to ever be coming which is a tragedy.

You can capture buildings and enemies with him, and if you did it correctly, you could then start building units and buildings of the opposite fracion! Not that it would matter much though, as both fractions have almost idenical units for most part (varied just look and attack type), even the same number of them varies just by 2-4 objects less or more on each side ovarall.\n\nGoing in Skirmish mode against AI was a bit pointless though - Difficulty gave the AI upper hand, instead of making it smarter. The enemy almost never used advanced weaponry, or buildings. I hope this will be different with this version.\n\nDespite its little flaws above, it could still be called [b]indescribably brilliant game[/b] - at the time of its relevance, and even in this day.

It's the only accurate game I've ever seen about our future, where humans are all dead and the arm clones fight the core planetary mind for control of the universe.  They don't even care about being alive or anything, they just want to annihilate the other side so so much.  Sometimes a battle can take like 8 hours and just grind on, it takes so much willpower to keep going, or to even notice when you get nuked.  It's an endless battle.  It also has a great soundtrack written by Jeremy Seole, who wrote a lot of the music in Secret of Evermore.  The first time I saw Total Annihilation, I was in Circuit City and I saw this cool looking guy getting bombed by 50 fast moving fighters and planes and he couldn't stop the computer from killing him and he eventually lost his commander and then his last towers and the map went grey.  It was like 1997 or something and he must have been horrible at the game and I don't think either of us bought anything from circuit city that day, but to see that cool guy get annihilated by an endless wave of planes was shocking to me.  He said \"damn it\" or something like that and then looked at his watch and said \"oh no\" and then he ran away, I guess he had to go somewhere and was late.  I saw it as a great challenge to become as good as he was some day, and I still feel like I'm not, but objectively I must have met that challenge because I have won wars against 10 computer players with population limits in the thousands.

Music switched depending on what you were doing, which was also uncommon at that time (with \"battle themes\" and \"quiet themes\" for construction phases, something we didn't see in every game at that time).\n\nUnit animation was also awesome for that time, with all those small robots animated everywhere. Seeing a group of robots run in one direction but with their torsos turned in another to shoot at an enemy is fun to see.\n\nThe game universe is great, very varied, lots of different map styles and landscapes.

Arm hat z.B. leichter gepanzerte Einheiten, die auch weniger Kosten, wohin gegen Core st\u00e4rker gepanzerte Einheiten mit h\u00f6heren Kosten hat (gilt jedoch nicht f\u00fcr alle Einheiten). Die Einheiten Leveln nach absch\u00fcssen, wenn auch sie nur zum Veteran werden k\u00f6nnen. Das gibt der Einheit dann einen kleinen Bonus auf Zielsicherheit, macht sie aber nicht \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfig stark wie in andern RTS-Titeln, wo das Leveln der Einheiten schon an RPG Spiele erinnert.\n\nDie Kampagne beider Seiten sind gut und f\u00fchren einen an die Einheiten herran. Im Skirmish (Gefecht) sollte man jedoch nicht allzuviel vom Computer erwarten (Er nutzt z.B. keine Atomraketen, woher man selbst auch keine nutzen sollte).\n\nIm Multiplayer geht der Spass erst los. Hier reicht es nicht einfach die st\u00e4rkste Einheit zu bauen und auf den Gegner zu Jagen. Selbst mit den billigesten Einheiten kann man im fortgeschrittenen Spiel noch Siegen (Masse statt Klasse). Egal See, Land oder Luftschlacht, jede Einheit kann n\u00fctzlich sein, wenn man rausfindet wie man sie nutzen kann.\n\nDie Grafik ist zwar mittlerweile altbacken, war jedoch f\u00fcr damalige Verh\u00e4ltnisse sehr gut und hat mit echten 3D Einheiten aufgewartet. Das Gel\u00e4nde ist Zweidimensional, hat jedoch verschiedene H\u00f6henlinien. Diese verbessern unter anderem auch die Reichweite von Waffen, die sich auf hohen Orten befinden. Oder man nutzt die Gel\u00e4ndeformationen als nat\u00fcrlichen Schutz vor eben jenen Waffen. Einheiten bewegen sich Bergauf langsamer als Bergab.\n\nDie Modder-Community im Internet ist bis heute Aktiv und bringt Patchs und Mods herraus. Diese haben teilweise nur Einheiten hinzugef\u00fcgt oder andere das Spiel komplett umgeschrieben um z.B. C&C nachzubilden oder eigenen Spiele zu erstellen.\n\nMan sollte den 5000-Einheiten patch (5k-Unit-patch) nachinstallieren.

When it was released in 1997, Total Annihilation was so far ahead of its time that in some respects it has never been duplicated since.\n\nAt the time I write this review there is no Steamworks multiplayer or Workshop mod support. But if these things are implemented, I have no doubts whatsoever that we will see a huge resurgence of Total Annihilation. There are already tens of thousands of third-party units, many mega-mods of hundreds of units, total conversions for everything from Star Wars to WWII to Gundam, to entirely new games built on TA as a basis. The amount of strategic depth flowing from fairly simple rules of collecting metal from metal spots and using it to construct various types of units, using a continous economy, physics-based battles, and a serious need for planning and tactics rather than unit counter relationships, make Total Annihilation a much deeper and more interesting strategy game than most of its contemporary cousins, including Starcraft and Age of Empires.\n\nReal time strategy games have been starved for ideas for many years now, with the most successful ones being sequels and spiritual successors to genuinely innovative strategy games from the '90s.

I myself can finaly battle with a Krogoth, something I've not done for 7 odd years.\n\nMost people buying and downloading this game have probably already played it, so I will spare it a rating breakdown, though it would be just about perfect score. Instead I will point out a couple bugs that I've been getting so far. I will edit this review with fixes as they come along. Feel free to comment for patches, fixes, whatnots.\n\n-Everytime game launches it squishes all my windows desktop icons together.\n\n-Will tab out of game to windows desktop whenever a new screen is loaded in game. Game doesn't crash though, so that if mostly fine.\n\n-Can't side scroll at a widescreen resolution. Also not turly an issue in my mind, just changed the resolution to 1024x600\n\n-Sometimes construction units will drop their shift queues.\n\n-Seems like Steam Overlay might not be compatible?\n\nOther than that the game is still the masterpiece that it always has been and the under $4 asking price is chump coin.

The best way I can descrbe it would be to think of Skyrim without mods, then think of Skyrim with mods that's effectively TA in a nuthshell.\n\nOptions:\n\n+ The developers certainly had longevity in mind, you can adjust the resolution up to 1920 x 1080.\n+ Provides all the options you might expect from a game of this age, perhaps abit more.\n- On/Off only, you can't find a middle ground without adjusting the files directly.\n\nGameplay\n\n+ A map for everybody! - every map has something for everybody the metal maps provide infinite resources and lead to a fast-paced style game. In contrast low metal maps have you fighting over resources while slowly pushing your way into the enemy base. Maps on distant moons have you transporting units by air over impassable chasms or bombing your opponent into the dust.\n\n+ Play how you want - Many RTS games have a 'defined' stratergy TA has no such definition, you will encounter players who love the good old peepee rush or those whose sole purpose is to watch you squirm as they destroy your outlying extractors. You'll encounter the turtles naturally but the game provides you with all the nessesary tools to enact your stratergy and descimate others.\n\n- AI Pathfinding - As mentioned the pathfinding is horrible and will almost certainly require fixing especially if you want to play Skirmish thankfully their are mods and simple scripts to fix this.\n\n- Performance - Most modern day PC's won't have a problem until like Skyrim you hit a point where your computer begins to chug along. This tends to arise from heavily modded games especially when you start to up the unit cap from 200 to 1000+\n\nCommunity:\n\n+ Still going strong not much else to say here besides the fact you have over 10 years of mods to discover some of which have been developed over so many years.", "timestamp_created": 1450435960, "timestamp_updated": 1450435960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 143, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.832964", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 9, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "total_positive": 1065, "total_negative": 44, "total_reviews": 1109}}

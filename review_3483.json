In fact, everything is pretty much the same as the first Peggle game. The levels are pretty much the same. The characters are pretty the same. Heck, even the MUSIC is pretty much the same. The only thing that's really notable about this game is that a lot of it borrows backgrounds, voices, and other elements from Half-Life 2 (among other games) while still just being Peggle in terms of actual gameplay (which is why it's rated T for Teen), so if you want that, fine, get it. Trust me, at least you won't be disappointed on THAT count at least. In fact, considering the game's actually free, you get a lot more than you might think (10 levels and 5 challenges, which still only took me a weekend to get through).

How the game is played, either by trial and error or more strategically, is entirely subject to whim.\n\nWithin ten levels, five challenges and the help of one playable character, namely the Peggle Master Bj\u00f6rn the unicorn, Peggle Extreme teaches the most basic mechanics that are needed to understand the Peggle ruleset. By and large, the game is very much akin to many arcade games that involve a ball to hit specific targets in a 2D environment. It's a twisted mix of pinball and Breakout with the exception that the player has more than enough time to potentially plan the next shot.\n\nThe otherwise colourful, child-friendly graphics and sounds are interspersed with images based on Valve's games and a few of their respective voice lines. Its difficulty is rather easy with a little bump when tackling the Master Challenges. The winning shot slow motion, glittering fireworks and the playing of the Ode to Joy feel a little over the top rewarding but that's part of the game's appeal.\n\nPeggle Extreme is a charming bite-sized puzzler perfect as an in-between snack.", "timestamp_created": 1501495175, "timestamp_updated": 1501495175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

SOoo addicting! Peggle Extreme is free to play! That's a big plus! It's different from the other Peggle games because it has it's own Portal / Half-Life / Team Fortress theme. Also it's more of a shortened version in comparison to the original Peggle game. If you like puzzle games and pinball games you're good to go with this one!\n\nWhat do you have to do in this game?\nYou have to shoot your ball from the top of the srceen downwards and clear the orange squares in order to complete a level.\nYour ball can fall in the pitt below when it's done bouncing around, but there is a ballbucket that moves constantly from side to side. That's where the ball you shot can fall into. When that happens your ball get's spared. When you begin a level you start of with 10 balls. You can earn extra balls if your ballscore is high enough which you can achieve by planning and timing your shots just right. Most of the time there is luck involved in this game. \n\nThere are different types of squares that you can hit with your ball. Blue, orange, purple and green.\nThey all have a different purpose and give you power ups or extra points. \nBlue squares (They are called Pegs) are normal point. \nOrange Pegs are the ones you need to clear in a level to complete it and they give you more points then the blue ones.\nPurple Pegs randomly appear on different spots and are always alone. This is some sort of multiplyer Peg that gives you a great deal of points, because every other Peg you hit gets multiplied!\nGreen pegs come in pairs in a level and are actually a Power Up for your character named 'Bjorn'. A weird Unicorn creature.\nThey give you guidelines that make it easier to see which Pegs you are going to hit with your ball.\n\nThere are Different modes in this game. An Adventure mode, Quick Play, Duel and Challenges.\nThese different modes give you enough fun to play this game for hours! Believe me.

Extreme\nDeveloper and publisher: PopCap Games\nReleased: 11 September, 2011\nGenre: Pachinko/Plinko\nSetting: Before Peggle Deluxe, Peggle Institute, somewhere in the multiverse\nSpoiler-free plot summary: There's been a breach in the multiverse, and headcrabs from the Half-Life universe are invading the Peggle Institute. You have to save the Institute with the help of City 17's Rebels, Counter-Terrorists, GLaDOS, and Mann Co.\n\nFull review: Peggle Extreme is a demo exclusive to Steam, using Valve's IPs to help advertise Peggle Deluxe.\n\nThis is your standard Peggle gameplay, but only Bjorn's magic power is available. There are only ten levels and five challenge levels. The campaign is fairly easy but the challenges are quite difficult.\n\nDo I recommend Peggle Extreme? Yes; it can entertain you for an hour or two, and is a nice piece of dessert after the meal that is Peggle Deluxe.", "timestamp_created": 1466719833, "timestamp_updated": 1467600455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23643069": {"recommendationid": "23643069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101481412", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468602827}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo extremamente divertido, relaxante e viciante.", "timestamp_created": 1466300191, "timestamp_updated": 1466300191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23504004": {"recommendationid": "23504004", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961527337", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465667308}, "language": "french", "review": "Au moins un Half-Life auquel je peux jouer sur des PC ne pouvant pas faire tourner le premier ;)", "timestamp_created": 1465658716, "timestamp_updated": 1465658716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23365442": {"recommendationid": "23365442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255297845", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464973584}, "language": "english", "review": "GOod. wish they made the adventure longer though...", "timestamp_created": 1464975902, "timestamp_updated": 1464975902, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23303355": {"recommendationid": "23303355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131484578", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437455330}, "language": "english", "review": "Its Peggle.", "timestamp_created": 1464672464, "timestamp_updated": 1464672464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23176657": {"recommendationid": "23176657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307382937", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464070431}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like puzzle games, Peggle is here for you.

She showed me the popcap games folder she had on there. There were many games on there, Insaniquarum Deluxe, Feeding Frenzy. A whole bunch, but the one that caught my eye was Peggle. \nIt was a simple-looking game, a 'casual' -looking game you could say. I thought it'd be fun to try out, the minute I launched the game and heard that glorious music, I knew I'd love it. 6-year-old me loved every second I'd played. I'd constantly ask my mother to take me back there to play it right up until I was 13 years old, between those 7 years I would say that Peggle was the greatest experience I had in my everyday life, until we moved to a town further away, I didn't think it was that big of a deal, but everynight I'd have dreams of playing Peggle, these dreams continued on for about 2 months. Up until I finally thought I was over it.\nIn September of 2013 I was 14-years old and created a Steam account, I tried my hand at some games such as Team Fortress 2 and Garry's mod, eventually got into CS:GO, These games were fun, but I always felt like there was this empty space in them that could have been filled. One year later, in 2014 I was looking at games on Steam to play, I didn't know what to search so I just put P... The first thing that came up was Peggle. \nI was lit with joy, I felt that same excitement I hadn't felt in years, I downloaded the game as soon as I could, it launched... That same music began blaring.

It's a very easy-going game, with simple graphics and music. Which is why it's surprising that [i]Peggle Extreme[/i] exists.\n\n[i]Peggle Extreme[/i] takes the classic [i]Peggle[/i] gameplay and juxtaposes it with imagery and sounds from Valve's [i]The Orange Box[/i]. It's kinda weird to see such a laid-back game crossing over with the likes of [i]Half-Life 2[/i], [i]Team Fortress 2[/i], and [i]Portal[/i], especially since the music is the same easy-listening cheese found in the original [i]Peggle[/i]. But the gameplay remains intact, and it's well worth downloading, since you don't have to pay for it.\n\nIt only comes with 10 levels and one instructor (Bjorn the unicorn), but there are also five challenges that you can try out. It's a pretty short game, but if you're already a fan, or you've never played any game in the series, this is a great little spin-off to get, especially for free.\n\n7 out of 10.", "timestamp_created": 1418168829, "timestamp_updated": 1418168914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13225813": {"recommendationid": "13225813", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066718515", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502608705}, "language": "english", "review": "it's exTREME", "timestamp_created": 1417702139, "timestamp_updated": 1417702139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489490", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13131277": {"recommendationid": "13131277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107330624", "num_games_owned": 553, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1382645086}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy cool y entretenido :D", "timestamp_created": 1417218442, "timestamp_updated": 1417218442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13078448": {"recommendationid": "13078448", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133660803", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424176978}, "language": "english", "review": "Bello!", "timestamp_created": 1416926675, "timestamp_updated": 1416926675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13053302": {"recommendationid": "13053302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045654764", "num_games_owned": 326, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416758869}, "language": "french", "review": "Peggle et l'orange Box qui ont un gosse ensemble.\n\n\u00c7a fait plaisir.", "timestamp_created": 1416742313, "timestamp_updated": 1416742313, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13053023": {"recommendationid": "13053023", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054008254", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 938, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416740640}, "language": "english", "review": "only 10 level then you need to buy the full game...display also not optimize for modern resolutions...", "timestamp_created": 1416740837, "timestamp_updated": 1416740837, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.430108", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13016946": {"recommendationid": "13016946", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980860747", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503281938}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0420\u0412\u0420\n\n\n,\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1416498237, "timestamp_updated": 1416498237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12980374": {"recommendationid": "12980374", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098308332", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423712489}, "language": "english", "review": "extra difficulty love this one too, ruin your life with this one :D:", "timestamp_created": 1416224088, "timestamp_updated": 1416224088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12971585": {"recommendationid": "12971585", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999638240", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 86400}, "language": "english", "review": "Great move from Popcap to introduce one of their best games to the people who never played it before.\nJust get it, you can play 10 levels of Peggle for free.

Orange Box customers a unique journey into a world where Peggle, Half-Life and Team Fortress collide for no apparent reason, creating a unique story where cute animals from Peggle rebel against the extra-dimensional invaders of the Valve multiverse (here portrayed as far more genocidal than Valve would have liked).

Es mas bien como una expansi\u00f3n gratuita sin necesidad de tener el original. Muy recomendable para los que les gusta los Arcade, los juegos de habilidad, y sobretodo los casual games.", "timestamp_created": 1391387620, "timestamp_updated": 1391387620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8937606": {"recommendationid": "8937606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026229717", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1387042275}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so extreme that when I started playing it Shaun White and Tony Hawk flew through my bedroom window.", "timestamp_created": 1391276771, "timestamp_updated": 1391276771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497822", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8930439": {"recommendationid": "8930439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108038493", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393475040}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u044f \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0451 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c!", "timestamp_created": 1391236028, "timestamp_updated": 1391236028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493912", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8916545": {"recommendationid": "8916545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118679176", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1391133416}, "language": "spanish", "review": "peggle es el deporte del hombre", "timestamp_created": 1391132983, "timestamp_updated": 1391132983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8915504": {"recommendationid": "8915504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124740530", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1391219198}, "language": "english", "review": "yes great fun addictivegame\n", "timestamp_created": 1391124704, "timestamp_updated": 1391124704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8915023": {"recommendationid": "8915023", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079439366", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1392436021}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game to waste time on, love it", "timestamp_created": 1391121369, "timestamp_updated": 1391121369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8868831": {"recommendationid": "8868831", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974027199", "num_games_owned": 1079, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431797445}, "language": "english", "review": "Peggle Extreme is an amazing game jampacked wiwth high octane peg on peg action with levels inspired by everyones favorite Valve games. \n\nLevels are at a good difficulty and can cause problems if you dont channel your inner pegglemaster.

And Peggle Extreme goes even more wacky, being a free promotional demo-version with levels taking place in universe of Valve's Orange Box games, with unicorn being the only available character. (who has his head being eaten by headcrab at title screen, scaring some part of casual audience away)\n\nIt's a completely free single player game that includes 10 exclusive levels, as been said, as well as hard 5 challenge levels for people who mastered peggle gameplay, as well as duel, with local multiplayer, where players take turns in shooting ball out. Nope, no Internet multiplayer there.\n\nIt should give you a good taste at what Peggle games are about. The gameplay was inspired by Pachinko games and been made just a bit more skill-based, while still having to guess where the ball will ricochet off. You take control of the cannon on top of screen and shoot uncontrollable ball in direction you choose, after which you are left hoping to get lucky to hit more orange pegs than just one.  You still can try to measure the timing, to get lucky to have your ball fall into basket, giving it back for free, or get one more ball by scoring a as many pegs and bonuses as possible.

It was offered with the Orange Box and it's not really a surprise: Popcap Games is also using Steam (mandatory when playing the Orange Box on PC) for broadcasting games made by them.\n\nThe story of Peggle Extreme is simple: you have to defend the Peggle Institute from invaders during 10 levels. Let me explain the gameplay. You have peggles on your screen. Peggles are these points or rectangles with different colors. Blue ones are the basic peggle, the orange ones are the ones you have to eliminate, the green ones are the speciality from your guide (in PE, it's only Bjorn the Unicorn and the fact that he can show the trajectory of your ball) and the rose one are point boosts and are chosen randomly when launching a new ball. The goal is to launch a ball and eliminate a maximum of peggles. I mean, with ten balls, you've had to eliminate every orange peggle, others being point bonuses. You have a bucket moving at the bottom and you can earn a free ball if the one currently launched falls into it.\n\nYou can also earn free balls by reaching a certain score with one ball during its play. The first step is 25.000 points. Also, you have the fevermeter. When reaching the X2, X3, etc., it increases the points tied to peggles: for example, a blue one that brings 10 points when touched is bringing 20 points when touched when your fevermeter indicates X2. And it's valid during all the level. There are also special bonuses like the long shot (touching two peegles far away from each other) or the lucky bounce (the ball touches the bucket, is bouncing and then falls into it. If it don't fall into it, the lucky bounce is missed). If your ball falls into the void without touching a peggle, you will have a coin with Free Ball or No Ball appearing. It's randomly, so, you can only pray that you'll have a second chance. That's only a view of the bonuses existing (you have extreme slide, orange attack, etc..). When finishing a level, the bucket disappeared and five special bonuses appear: 10.000 at the far left and far right, 50.000 for the two others and for the middle, it's 100.000 points. Note that if you clean your screen of all the peggles, you're unlocking Ultra Extreme Fever and all the five voids bring 100.000 points.\n\nYou have also special features for the duel mode: -25% of your points if the ball doesn't touch a peggle and falls directly in the void or in the bucket for example.\n\nThe backgrounds are customized to the Orange Box games with Peggle Masters appearing in it. Half-Life 2 Episode 2 is represented by a Vortigaunt attacking a Peggle Master, a Headcrab, a Hunter. Team Fortress is symbolized by an Heavy with a Peggle Master, a sentry build by an Engineer, a Pyro pursuing a Peggle Master and a BOOM! probably taken from a trailer. Portal is more interesting by the fact that you have portals that change the location of your ball. You have the lovely turret and the Weighed Companion Cube. Every game is featuring the voice of characters appearing in it. For HL2E2, it didn't really let a trace in my brain but for TF2, you have the voice from the Heavy, like the \"You did well!\". For Portal, it's our dear psycho Glados.\n\nAs you can suppose, graphics are simple, not really complicated and very cartoonish for the Peggle Masters. Backgrounds are more similar to the original graphics of the game than being cartooned. Soundtrack is also perfect.\n\nThe different modes are also challenging. Duel Mode is made for playing alone against the computer or for playing with a friend. Adventure Mode is the solo campaign. The Quick Mission is for playing unlocked levels and the Challenge Mode is for people liking Challenge. It's a sort of Bonus Map like in Portal: you have to beat the challenge for gaining the title of Peggle Master for the level: clean all the peggles, reach a certain high score: 300.000 for example, eliminate all the orange peggles (the classic gameplay). I can guarantee you that reaching a high score is easier than trying to clean your screen. Currently, I'm a Peggle Master in each level, the last title is the cleaning of the first level with the Vort.\n\nPeggle Extreme isn't suffering from flaws, apart the shortness of the game, being a product designed for the Orange Box and the fact that you will not beat every level at your first try. Believe me, you'll find the BOOM! and the sentry levels very challenging. And wait to see the level from Portal and its three parts you can only access by taking portals.\n\nAnyway, for me, this game is really enjoyable, if you don't try this, you don't know what you're missing. I mean, if you can afford the Orange Box or if you can buy on Steam. Peggle Extreme is probably one of the best casual games I've played and I'll admit it: seeing G-Man as the sun or Bjorn with a Headcrab is something that HL fans can't miss. Anyway, I'll recommend it.

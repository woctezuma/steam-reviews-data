J. Grandville's illustrations that portrayed animals in human form; The Soundtrack contains the compositions of the Great musician Camille Saint-saens that fits perfectly in the game; And the story is very well written, looking a lot like old detective and mistery novels, but with a sense of humor.\n\nYou play the role of a lawyer (no, not the real life greedy monster, but the fictional good citizen who cares deeply about justice) that wanders around the city of Paris looking for clues and evidences that would help your case.\nIn terms of gameplay, it is a visual novel, so gameplay is not really the focus, but it doesnt disappoint, you have the responsability of carrying the story, you have to make decisions and drive the plot, your choices matter, but due to the obvious limitations of a 2D game featuring still images as characters, it is no ''Life is Strange''. \nAside from making choices you can also, search an area for evidence, defend your client in several trials, interview witness and citizens around the town, carefully manage your days and where to go on the map (you only have one place per day to investigate in a very short period of time till the next trial) and even gamble!\n\nBut I need to point out that the game is actually pretty easy, it only takes simple deduction and a minimal level of intelligence to figure things out, the evidences are pretty easy to find, the people basically vomit clues on you all the time, but of course, if you dont make the right decision you might miss things. But all that is not really important, since, as I said, its a visual novel, the story needs to unfold in front of us. its just a bit distracting that things happen too conveniently, theres ALWAYS evidence, ALWAYS traces of the guilty man, ALWAYS witnesses that you happen to stumble into, things that dont really happen in real life, and if it wasnt a game, it would be pretty unbelievable as a story too.\n\nFor an indie project that was kickstarted, the game has a lot of quality, specially since it was made by a small group of people, Ive seen lots of indie productions that lack this kind of quality, Even if they borrowed most of the characters, scenery and music, the animation is good too, the way the camera moves, how characters interact and all that. But, if Im going to nitpick... When the designs are not borrowed from J.J. Grandville's works... it kinda shows... you can spot which characters were created for the game and which ones were Grandville's, and even if you couldn't spot it, there's a specific part of the game that broke the esperience a little bit for me, that is when they have a trial underground, in a place full of bones and skulls, the scenery there reveals a very amateur work, an artstyle that doesnt belong on such a beautiful game, again, im nitpicking, but that bothered me a little and it would be much better if the team had an extra effort to make that part of the game a little bit prettier.\n\nAnother nitpick is the fact that the game doesnt feature acchivements and doesnt let you screenshot in-game (maybe thats only a problem for me), those small features are part of what makes it a special experience to play this game on STEAM, instead of you know... downloading it illegally (which is a huge dick move to an indie game).\n\nThose are the only ''complaints'' I can really make about the game, the story is a very pleasant experience and I can say that I was completely hooked by it, thats the sign of a good mistery, you cant stop until you've discovered it. And of course, by making different choices you unlock different endings too, which is great because there's a lot of replay value, you cant just uncover every part of the game and its misteries in a single playthrough. The characters are very likeable and well written, and the story brings intriguing themes about the concept of justice and revolution.\nIts a very nice and well put together game that you should own right now.", "timestamp_created": 1514564386, "timestamp_updated": 1514564386, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38799571": {"recommendationid": "38799571", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965994387", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 328, "last_played": 1514503791}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to wholeheartedly recomend this game, but I can't. \nI can however give a strong qualified recommendation.\nIn some ways, Aviary Attorney feels like a fan game of the Ace Attorney series, but I don't mean that in a pejorative way. It's  just clear that it's heavily inspired Ace Attorney, and it is loving take on similar narrative/gameplay themes and story beats.  That being said, it's got a lot of it's own unique ideas both in terms of its setting and it's gameplay that prevent it from feeling derivative.  However, there are a few problems that prevent it from reaching excellence.\n\nFirst of all, the game is somewhat buggy; the game regularly crashed either on launch or when attempting to enter full screen mode.  Additionally, it's lacking some features that are critical  for game which is predominantly text, such as a text log and an option to skip previously read text.  The game contains a lot of alternate dialog and several different endings, but the inability to quickly skip previously read text makes accessing this content more of a chore than it needs to be.\nAdditionally the game suffers from pacing problems.  Ironically, it has the opposite pacing problem that the Ace Attorney series has.  Often Ace Attorney games feel needlessly long and dragged out, whereas Aviary Attorney goes by far too quickly.  Otherwise satisfying character growth arcs feel rushed, reveals of dramatic twists come too suddenly and feel un-earned and the excellent setting isn't adequately explored.  This effects the gameplay as well, as the cross examinations are extremely simple and underwhelming. \nRegardless  for a sale price of under 5 dollars, Aviary Attorney is an enjoyable, if brief experience that truly deserves a sequel which is expanded in scope.", "timestamp_created": 1514505406, "timestamp_updated": 1514505406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38797532": {"recommendationid": "38797532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085055487", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 289, "last_played": 1514509477}, "language": "english", "review": "lawyer birbs are all you need. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1514500625, "timestamp_updated": 1514500625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38794017": {"recommendationid": "38794017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049255950", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "last_played": 1514076990}, "language": "english", "review": "Ace Attorney but with birds. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1514493470, "timestamp_updated": 1514493470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38781854": {"recommendationid": "38781854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198244275688", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "last_played": 1513878448}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Conozcas o no Ace Atorney de antes de empezar a jugar esta obra maestra (s\u00ed, maldita sea, \u00a1es una obra maestra!) te va a encantar. \n\u00bfHistoria?

Games like Sonic the Hedgehog, Spyro the Dragon, and Crash Bandicoot all brought birds to the forefront of gaming entertainment with their colorful bird protagonists, hinting at a bright future for avian kind. But as console generations came and went, the medium's focus shifted, and birds were all but lost in the gaming spectrum. Thankfully, all is not lost, and thanks to sleeper hits like Hatoful Boyfriend and Penguins Arena and the popular Tropes vs. Birds video series by Tweeta Parakeetian, birds are back, and better than ever - which brings us to the latest in bird entertainment, Aviary Attorney.\n\nAvian Attorney is, as it says in the title, a game about birds practicing in the school of law - unlike its bird of a feather, Hatoful Boyfriend (which held its surprise so close to its plumage that even today most people still think it's a joke game about dating birds), this time it's just you, the birds, and the mysteries within. While it's not necessarily an original idea, predated by famous bird lawyer series Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law more than a decade ago, it provides a fresh perspective through its unique presentation, in both its art style and music.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Aviary Attorney will probably come as second nature to anyone familiar with the similarly named Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney series (which, despite its misleading title, is not about mystical birds). It's a visual novel with mystery elements, in which you travel between various locations gathering evidence leading up to a court trial. Unlike Phoenix Wright, however, travelling between most locations takes a day of your time, and you only have a certain amount of time before each court session begins, making you think more about where you need to go. There are four cases, with minor choices throughout the cases that lend to replayability (and frequently leave you wondering whether or not you've made a mistake), and the fourth case has 3 varients which are vary significantly both in story and length, and altogether the game lasted me around 7 hours. There are occasional bugs here and there, but the developer seems to be working hard to iron out the problems and in the time I've been playing it there have already been two small patches for it. If you're a fan of mystery games, particularly of the Ace Attorney variety, this is a pretty easy purchase overall.

You fill the role of a defense attorney, Jayjay Falcon, and It plays much like a visual novel. The game is divided into the investigation bits, where you visit different places with your lackey Sparrowson, and pick up pieces of evidence, and the trial bits, where you use everything you collected to defend your client from the prosecution.\n\nPROS\n++The humor. I do understand that humor is subjective, but I must say the silliness of the jokes and puns hit just the right spot with me. While the game sports a 'revolution' sort of theme, it doesn't take itself that seriously for the most part.\n\n+The character design is amazing. I understand the art was taken from public domain, and it fit really well with the theme of the game.\n\n+While I think the game lacked more... 'climaxy' music, I thought it also fit just fine with the scenario and the thematic, overall.\n\nCONS\n-Story is a bit too short. I pretty much finished the 4 cases in 6 hours (averaging 90 minutes per case), and I could see in the reviews that some people took even less time to finish the game.\n\n-Lack of different poses. The characters use the same pose most of the time, so the game feels a bit... static. The characters only show different emotions through text, pretty much.\n\n-The game also lacks a quicksave feature. So you pretty much have to rely on the daily autosaves, and as such, you can't do things like stop the game mid-trial and pick it up later. The fact that the cases are short makes it so that this isn't much of a problem though, but it'd be a welcome feature nonetheless.\n\nNEUTRAL POINTS\nThe story. It's not bad, but it's not particularly great either. I thought it was interesting, and I was entertained throughout the game, so I think it does the job fine, though.\n\nThe difficulty of the cases. They're pretty easy for the most part. None of them require that much out of the player to deduce what transpired (save for a particular plot twist), and I didn't have any trouble on figuring out when to present what evidence. It's still fun enough, though.\n\nCOMMENT\nOne thing I think I should point out: you CAN lose trials and the game WILL continue. As such, when you're doing the investigation bits, don't hesitate to use your player powers to reload the game if you feel you did things in the wrong order, because you can miss pieces of important evidence. Or if you're fine with that, just roll with it and do your best, and replay the game later if you want to get a different ending or different outcomes for the trials.\n\nCONCLUSION\nWhile it has its problems, I do recommend this game, especially if you've played the Ace Attorney series or you're a fan of courtroom drama (or comedy).

The nods to Ace Attorney were fun and amusing, especially to someone like me who really likes the series, and it played the mood very well. And then I won the first trial, and it made me lose my shit, it was amazing. THe second act was interesting and fun, and the third was nail-biting and tense. However...\nThe fourth act is where this game lost me. From here, if you want to avoid spoilers, stop reading, and know that despite not liking the fourth act, it doesn't break the game for me and I still reccomend it. This next bit is primarily for the developers.\n\n4a is... Well, 4a feels more like a farce than anything else, especially since the opportunity is given to speak up and you're even asked if you're sure if you don't want to speak. From a gameplay standpoint, the only reason you would chose this option is out of pure curiosity or if you truly, TRULY hate the character that's about to die. There's no logical and barely any emotional reason to chose this option, which makes the fact that it gives you an entirely seperate ending sequence all the more frustrating, and it makes Falcon look like a fucking idiot for throwing a fit and doing what he does afterwards. He blames the resistance, but he gives up a very clear and consice opporunity to step in and at least TRY to do something about it. \nIf you made this ending result from getting lost in the catacombs and being too late, it would read so much better, especially since the guard makes a remark about you not having a torch, it leads the player to believe that getting lost is possible. As it is, you actually cannot get lost in the catacombs, I actually tried. If you made the ending result from getting lost and arriving too late rather than Falcon actively chosing not to speak up, it would make more sense that he doesn't place blame on himself and instead on Beaumont, viewing it as he did the best he could. From there, giving up being a lawyer and leaving it to Sparrowson makes sense from an emotional and character standpoint. \nSparrowson... doesn't make for a strong player character. He was built to be a companion/comic relief and it shows. That said, I don't think the narritive suffers TOO much for it. The investigating is simple but relatively solid, the trial is at least somewhat interesting, and Falcon's actions and motives are engaging. The conversations with Beaumort are decent as well. That said, there really isn't an end to this... ending. It just stops. The fire happens, we're told the revolution happens, and that's it. You can chose whether or not to turn Falcon in, but it doesn't change much either way.\n\nEnding 4b, on the other hand, is atrocious. For successfully saving Cocorico, you get an ending that railroads you and is boring. The only real choice you have is in what order to go places, and the trial is a joke at best, seeing as it doesn't matter what you do or what choices you make, the King still looks shitty. The Viridian Killer is revealed for seemingly no reason, the bombings happen, the revolution just happens, and the King is fooled and probably killed, who knows, I didn't pay attention. There's no gameplay, no real climax, everything just kind of happens and you sit back and watch. At best, it's stupid and boring, at worst, it's arbitrary and makes you feel cheated. This is a massive missed opportunity to actually show the king in a grey light instead of a bad one, or to get Falcon in trouble with the Revolution for daring to defend the king and twist the truth to make him look better. As it is, this ending holds no appeal, no weight, nothing but a boring ending painted as happily ever after, and even then, it's just stupid. I don't have anything against happy endings, but it doesn't fit with the rest of the game and all and getting this ending for doing everything right made me feel like I'd been cheated.\nI think the major issue, though, is the fact that in a game that takes the Black/White morality you expect and turns it on its head to paint the world in wonderful, engaging shades of gray (funny, considering the visuals themselves are in black and white), the king and the trial are painted so starkly black and white that it yanks you out of the experieince. As I said, nothing you do makes any difference, and you might as well have not collected any evidence at all. Not a single person you talk to has a nice word to say about the king and the king himself shows no sign of actually having any good in him either. It's a large, black stain on an otherwise beautifuly gray game.\n\nAs for 4c... It starts off relatively strong, especially compared to the other two endings. You fail the trial and Cocorico is killed. You're given a choice to join or die, and joining does seem like a decent option, at least to help survive. If you've been paying attention at all, you'll know exactly what to ask Fontaine about to distract him so Sparrowson can escape. Then you go around with Beaumort and see things from her point of view, for the most part. It doesn't quell your anger about, or justify her killing, Cocorico, but it shows the rebels in a more sympathetic light and shows they really are trying to make things better. I think it does bring a bit more of the problem with black/white morality in a world that's painted gray, but it's not as bad as with the king, because it's shown that while the Rebellion have good intentions, all of them are relatively grey in morality, such as Fontaine and Pierro having the argument about what they owe each other and Beaumort herself letting her emotions overcome her want for the Revolution to be nonviolent when it comes to her father's death and Cocorico.\nIt also feels like you could be influencing her, especially with the discussions about barricades and the police, and gives you the hope that even if you can't stop the revolution, you could at least coax it to be less violent. And you do indeed. Of course, the wolves have to go fuck it up, which is frustrating, but not in a bad storytelling way, more in a \"fuck you villian\" way. You're not alone in thinking the police had nothing to do with it, as another of the Rebellion thinks so as well, which is a great move, as it keeps the narritive from spiraling into total despair and gives you an ally, helping the drive to fight for the truth and giving the notion you will be able to potentially have a trial and find the truth. And when you do, things go to shit because of the Friar. That said, there are only two issues I have with this one.\nOne, it's too easy. You have one piece of evidence literally handed to you, and the fact that Volerti doesn't have a left hand could have been left to the player to point out from if they've been paying attention, and overall, it's just kind of blowing over. That said, it's better than 4b, since you actually can fail, and it doesn't feel like you're being railroaded, simply that you're pointing out the obvious in some places.\nSecond, what happens after the fighting starts is sort of... Strange. I don't see the narritive point of having the fates of Beaumort and Falcon be ambiguous/having them disappear, especially since the Second Republic won. Who is their new leader? What happened to the others? It leaves questions, but those questions feel like the game is simply waving its hands in front of the player and shouting \"OOOOOH ISN'T THIS SO MYSTERIOUS????\" It's not awful, just strange.\nOverall, 4c is the best written of the three endings, and the only one that was actually fun to play, which is disapointing seeing as it's the ending that results from losing the trial in Act 3.\n\nWhen all is said and done, though, I really enjoyed this game. For the first attempt from this game dev, it was astoundingly solid overall, and if a second game came out, I would likely buy it.

Je neemt in deze game de rol op je van Jayjay Falcon, een gevleugelde advocaat. Ik zal in deze korte recensie vooral de game vergelijken met Ace Attorney.\n\n- De visuele stijl is monochroom en ge\u00efnspireerd door oude karikaturen. Het is visueel indrukwekkend, maar niet zo expressief als de animatie, kleur en ontwerpen van Ace Attorney personages.\n\n- De gameplay bestaat vooral uit klikken op objecten in de omgeving, dialoogkeuzes maken en (in de rechtzaken) bewijzen uit je inventaris presenteren. De structuur is bijna identiek aan Ace Attorney, maar het kost een in-game dag om een lokatie te bezoeken, dus je kunt de rechtzaak ingaan zonder dat je alle bewijzen hebt gevonden.\n\n- In Ace Attorney begint het hoofdstuk opnieuw als je een zaak verliest. In Aviary Attorney gaat het verhaal door, ongeacht of je wint of verliest. Dit geeft het verhaal de ruimte om te veranderen op basis van je keuzes, en het laatste hoofdstuk kan zich op drie totaal unieke manieren vertakken afhangende van je keuzes.\n\n- Het overkoepelende verhaal is interessant en berust op echte gebeurtenissen in de Franse geschiedenis.\n\nAan te raden voor fans van de Ace Attorney serie en andere mensen die op zoek zijn naar moordmysteries. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511378447, "timestamp_updated": 1511378447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507692", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36729288": {"recommendationid": "36729288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061873546", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480025142}, "language": "english", "review": "Best bird lawyering game I've ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1511376821, "timestamp_updated": 1511376821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647356", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36711113": {"recommendationid": "36711113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042367597", "num_games_owned": 676, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 454, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459891947}, "language": "english", "review": "Possibly the second or third best game about birds and the rise of the Second French Republic.", "timestamp_created": 1511375013, "timestamp_updated": 1511375013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508251", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36626449": {"recommendationid": "36626449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069553670", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511725126}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u559c\u6b22\u9e1f\u5417\uff1f\u559c\u6b22\u9006\u8f6c\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u98ce\u683c\u5417\uff1f\u559c\u6b2219\u4e16\u7eaa\u6cd5\u56fd\u7684\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u5417\uff1f\n\n\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u7684\u8bdd\u9002\u5408\u5927\u6298\u6263\u5165\uff0c\u4e2d\u4e24\u4e2a\u9002\u5408\u5c0f\u6298\u6263\u5165\uff0c\u5168\u4e2d\u7684\u2026\u2026\u4f60\u8fd8\u7b49\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1511106587, "timestamp_updated": 1511106587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534050", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36602352": {"recommendationid": "36602352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027347705", "num_games_owned": 667, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510760146}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041c\u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0441, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044e\u043c\u043e\u0440, \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u0421\u0435\u043d-\u0421\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430 \u0438 \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0446\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u043c \u043f\u043e \u0432\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0443. \n\u0412 \u0442\u043e \u0436\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f, \u0443 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0440\u044f\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0438\u0439 \u043a \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0435 \u0434\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0435 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u044f. \u0415\u0449\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u044f \u0431\u044b \u0435\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430.\n\n*\u041d\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430.", "timestamp_created": 1511025651, "timestamp_updated": 1511577555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36329511": {"recommendationid": "36329511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065521889", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452315253}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

For 5.4 Hrs? But it must be said that I played every English Ace Attorney game. So the game might not have been able to trick my already programed brain.\n\nSpeaking about Ace Attorney, how much does this game steal from that? Well the very basics but it also does a few things from the Ace Attorney Alpha. The Alpha of the famous Game Boy Advance game turned Game Boy DS was that the entire court case would be performed live. Every choice you made and every moment you saw, if done incorrectly could lead to your loss.\n\nThis is a game where you can lose. Not from life lost or quick bad end choice but from other reasons.\n\nNow with that spoler out of the way....\n\nAviary Attorney does not have much animashion. Again it uses the basic drawings of Mr  J. J. Grandville, The mouth movement of characters are well enough. But outside of jumping about and false turning there is not much animashion around. Of course the game will do it's best with this limit and some of the jokes are funny. The music is good enough and sets a a basic tone. The backgrounds are again of Mr. J J so they are very nice to look at. And the options of getting around in the game are very nicely done. It makes sure you will have track of what you need and who every character is.\n\nOverall I will have to say that the story is very nice for an Ace Attorney player. It will have some major diffrences and will feel fresh. To people that have never played that game this should be enough of a experince into the limited \"lawyer logic\" games out there. Speaking of that I would look into a free Konergate game called Socrates Jones: Pro Philosopher. Get past the very first character and ask you self. \"Was this fun?\" \"Was this wasteful?\" \"Do I want to keep going?\"\n\nIf that game bore you to tears, well then Aviary Attorney would have more plot and a much serious case on its hands. Overall thought if you did enjoy it, your likely to enjoy Aviary Attorney. I mean that. People that enjoy games that you need to read a lot and go with logic will enjoy this. The game is also slightly harder.\n\nBut now I'll finish with this. Since 2016 the group behind this game have gone quiet. Apparently some side game or other story was to be released. So...You might want to also look into what Kickstarter project offered and what they delivered.\n\nThats all.

The dialog is often tongue-in-cheek or just plain silly, the characters likeable.\n\nThe game only lasts 6-10 hours.

This game can stand on its own merit. It doesn't hold your hand too much in the first trial, it's not too difficult, and it has a good sense of when to allow you to present the evidence you know you have.\n\nThe overarching storyline is interesting in its own right, and is what really helps this game stand alone. I'm not going to spoil anything, but even though I'm not a huge history buff, or France buff, I didn't feel lost or disinterested during the goings-on of the setting.\n\nMy only real criticisms are thus: Some points at the very very end felt a bit quickly paced, but at the same time, I feel as if they had to be that way. The path that matters most (in my opinion, at least) is the most satisfying in this manner. Additionally, the same ending music is used for the conclusion of each path, which (again, trying to avoid spoilers) doesn't fit with every progression, and it created a dissonant mood in some circumstances.\n\nOtherwise, I just find myself wishing there were more to play.

There's an wonderful amount of detail and love made in each and every one of them and they provide a great way to convey the theme of 19th century France in which the story takes place. You might be thinking that lack of graphics would make the game feel dull and empty,but in all honestly the great works of French caricaturist J. J. Grandville, while seeming like a relic of bygone era when the artists had very few options and mediums to express their craft, manage to build a perfectly fitting atmosphere for the player to experience the story. The background illustrations are an accurate historic depiction of 19th century Paris based on public domain lithographs. It's really some amazing work that the developers have put into creating this gem of a game and it shows from the very first moments.\n\nMusic and soundtrack is by legendary romantic-era composer Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns and it creates a suitable audio experience that ties greatly with the game. Many of the classical compositions you will listen during your playthrough are familiar via other works of art but they never feel like out of place for the game.\n\nThe characters despite not uttering a single line of audio dialogue, excel by the phenomenal writing of the game. They are very colorful and have their own quirks which will you pleasantly discover during the playthrough. They can be funny, ruthless, conniving, innocent or just pure evil. They come to life even as anthropomorphic caricatures and that's a sign of brilliant writing.\n\nThe dialogue is the main strength of the game and is superbly written for the most part. There are great lines, lots of humor and tongue-in-cheek moments, horrible/amazing puns and it gets serious when needed.\n\nGameplay consists of gathering evidence and interviewing suspects and witness. Should you gather enough information regarding your case, you'll need to present in during the trial on court day by cross-examining the witlessness. Presenting the proper evidence at the proper time will sway the jury in your favor. Truth be told the gameplay mechanics are incredibly simple but I do believe that any further amount of complexity would deviate too much from the theme of the game. While it might appear fairly straightforward there are a few situation where you could fail a case so it's important to be thorough with your investigation.\n\nThere's a total of 4 acts to experience with the 4th having 3 possible endings depending on your actions on the 3rd. Acts are self-contained in their stories but also there are several recurring characters who will appear throughout the whole game.\n\nI do however have a few minor complaints about the game. A personal pet peeve of mine was the lack of a 'on-the-spot' saving system. Instead the game saves after the end of a day. Not a huge gripe but a minor inconvenience in my book. I would also mention that if you skip a piece of dialogue by accident there's no way of going back to read since the game has no chat log so I would advice caution.\n\nAll in all, Aviary Attorney was a very pleasant experience for around 4 hours. The dialogue and characters are masterfully done and each moment of written dialogue with the anthropomorphic characters was pure delight. The gameplay elements might be simple but the game excels in creating an engaging story for the player.

It's a shame they aren't on Steam. Now that I've gotten that out of the way I bought this game looking for a familiar vibe. This game is all that and more. Even though the comparison is clear this game has it's own unique style and a couple of different mechanics that make it more evolved than it's lovable aforementioned cousin. \n\nEverything from the visual style and music all the way to some time management mechanics make Aviary Attorney a game all it's own. The setting and graphics remind me of a Piranesi painting. If you don't know who that is don't worry, just know the art is extremely detailed and works with the setting being 1840s France. The fact that the main cast are two well dressed dapper birds are characters that aren't quite endearing but at the same time are well animated through their dialogue and actions. There's definitely a lot of light hearted humor mixed in with all the evidence gathering and hard work that befalls an attorney. \n\nThe real guts of this game is the time management before a trial. This is where things  can get a little tough. While most games of this kind tend to have a straightforward path in this game it's entirely possible for you to miss some evidence or lose a case. You have to manage your time before the trial wisely and make sure you're properly prepared for court. Losing sucks but life goes on and so does the game. You can also get penalized in court for wasting time with red herring questioning. I feel like that level of challenge makes you think a bit more strategically because if you only have 6 days before a case then you have to choose what is relevant to pursue. It really makes you think, but not too much. \n\nI've only played through the first 2 cases and so far I like what I see. It's a fresh take on the genre and adds some things that make it a different kind of animal. Definitely pick it up if you're into the Ace Attorney series. It's fresh, entertaining, and the writing's solid.", "timestamp_created": 1498920505, "timestamp_updated": 1498920505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33022789": {"recommendationid": "33022789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049147250", "num_games_owned": 647, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498797366}, "language": "english", "review": "I had a great time with this game. It is clearly influenced by the Ace Attorney series of games, and I feel like it has accomplished its own little place in the library of puzzling law games. It has its own unique quirks and style, with interesting characters and cases to play through. There's a lot I like about this game, and a few things I feel could be improved upon.\n\nThe theme and art style are really charming. It is set in 19th century France and you play as a falcon lawyer named Jayjay Falcon who is accompanied by his assistant, Sparrowson. Both characters are very fun to follow and see their dialogue and banter they have together. All of the characters being animals is a neat twist and gave everyone their own added flair of unique personalities. The hand-drawn art style was also very pleasant.\n\nThe game is witty and well-written, and the cases themselves are interesting. You spend the days before the trial doing your investigations and it is less linear than in Ace Attorney. You can unfold the case in different ways depending on where you investigate first and what choices you make. The game is unique in that each case can actually have a different outcome depending on what pieces of evidence you do and don't find, resulting in different endings for each case and different endings for the game. This is hindered slightly by the non-functioning save system. There is an option in the menu for saving & quitting, but the game doesn't save. The game only saves at the end of each day. The game still works well without this function, but it shouldn't be there if it does not work. Also, considering the cases have different outcomes, it would be nice to not only save whenever you'd like, but to have different save files to easily go back to try and go for a different outcome of a case. Especially since events in the third case affect the ending you receive. Although, this game does have replay value, so I don't think many people would have a problem going back and starting the cases from the beginning to see what other sorts of things they can do that they missed from their first play-through.\n\nAnother thing that's a bit of a negative is that there is no option to read through previously read dialogue. So if you accidentally skip through some, you cannot go back to read it. Other than the few nitpicky thing here and there, this game is a lot of fun for any Ace Attorney fan or mystery/puzzle fan in general.

The music is excellent, and all of the dialogue is well-written, despite a few typos here and there, (mostly missing the word \"to\" in some sentences). \n\nIn short, I'd recommend this game if you're looking for a fun little puzzle game or visual novel.", "timestamp_created": 1494540350, "timestamp_updated": 1494540350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501661", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31625728": {"recommendationid": "31625728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074994175", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508611641}, "language": "english", "review": "Aviary Attorney is a court style/investigation video game (set in the early 1840's in France where everyone is animals and you play as a bird) which is akin to the Ace Attorney and the Professor Layton style gameplay all rolled into one game.\nPros:\n-There are quite a few different twists throughout the game\n-The artstyle is absolutely terrific and it looks absolutely beautful\n-The characters are well written and have a lot of deth to them\n-The music is well written as well; it sounds like it belongs in that time period which is good for this kind of game\n-The courts scenes are wekl thought out and differ from the Ace Attorney style (although I don't mind either)\n-The invesitgation scenes are very good and help provide a lot of information towards the story of the game\n\nCons:\n-It is a little bit on the short side\n\nSo if you are a fan of Puzzle/Visual novel games such as Professor Layton and Ace Attorney, then this game is right up your ally.

Namely: that you cannot go back to view previously read dialogue; that the third act hinges heavily upon a preset path of strict conditions to achieve the best ending; and that the fourth act ends up being extremely linear regardless of which path you end up in after the third act. The fourth act is less about the cases than the narrative, which is fine; but it felt me leaving a little deflated hoping for a real test of the attorney's lawyering skills and instead receiving a large amount of non-interactive character drama.\n\nThere is also one particular scene in the third act where the background art takes a horrible nosedive in quality during one of the most dramatic moments in the game.

Now gameplay wise, it's little more than a visual novel, lifting a lot of the \"deductive\" option choices from Phoenix Wright and leaving out much of the DS gimmick gameplay such as speaking into the console's microphone or blowing on the senser. Despite that, Aviary Attourney really holds up as an indie game of the genre because of its cleverly written plot that balances Phoenix-y humor with some surprisingly grounded themes of morality backed by some heavy outcomes based on your choices. The plot takes place in a semi-parodic version of 1848 France (so if the \"touty, prissy Frenchy\" setting is not your cup of tea, this game is not going to change anything) where everyone is some form of anthropomorphic Frenchman/woman. You lead a (Phoenix-y familiar) defense attourney trying to make a buck during a time when revolution is but a bulletshot away from erupting. Your decisions will determine the course of history in ths world and this is one of those few games where you decisions REALLY matter. It's perhaps the only game I've ever played that I felt absolutely compelled to play through every single ending and felt thoroughly rewarded for doing so. The devs have really gone through and made sure every single ending contributes heavily to the world building and subplot mysteries of this game. And for that, I found this game absolutely charming.\n\nThat being said...there are some technical issues. As of writing, the devs are working hard to fix a number of bugs for DRM free release. But when I played through the game, I had the game black-screen-crash on me about 5 times trying to get through a chapter. And there are few things to really dampen the experience of a mystery based visual novel type game than playing through the exact same plot drop five times.

Combined with a save system that only lets you restart at the beginning of the day, that led to a frantic tension during the quick courtroom scenes where my case wasn't strong enough to always save my client.

Apart from the masterpiece graphics and classic music acting better than any form of narration, the game has a very innovative way of ending a crime investigation with a defense's point of view rather than the prosecutor's. And it's not only about showing the evidence you've gathered! The best part of each trial is the cross-examination where you get to nit-pick at the words of the witnesses and form your own theories, some convincing (ones that buy you the heads-up from the jury) and some totally fantastical (which might end up ruining the trial completely). These trials test your wits far more than your point-and-click abilities and inspire some real stress, as well as fulfillment once the trial is won! The background (revolutionary France) and the story are well-crated. And the characters are very adorable and convincing.

It's great for Ace Attorney fans, and I think should be great for non-Ace Attorney fans as well. Obviously, it's a visual novel, so don't expect much gameplay. \n\nWhile this game is clearly a love letter to Ace Attorney, it attempts to stand out on its own too, and I believe it does that really well. The art style is really interesting, and really nice. The music is appropriate to the art style as well and gives the whole game a really nice atmosphere. \n\nThe dialogue is mostly what you'd expect from Ace Attorney. Doesn't take itself too seriously most of the time, but from time to time it'll get there. It's mostly silly stuff that you can expect. There's a couple references I don't totally like (Most are references to Ace Attorney, but I find that's acceptable considering the whole game is meant to be a love-letter to it.) but the references are very very few and mostly harmless.\n\nWhere as Modern Ace Attorney games are absolutely filled to the brim with horrible filler and unskippable flashbacks, I actually wish this game had a bit more. I think this game was desperately in need of a third case before the final one to really get a sense of the game and the characters in it, and honestly, I just wanted more stuff in general. \n\nThe first two cases are probably the best, as they're a lot shorter and a lot more focused. The last case isn't bad by any means, but it can get a bit off track at times, and due to there being multiple endings, it might have caused some other endings to feel less fleshed out and finished. It's still a great time, however. Like I said, the only real con with this game, I just wish there was more. \n\nOne last very slight issue, there's not exactly a fast forward button. towards the end, you'll be wanting to see the different endings, because they are quite different and a bit lengthy, but there's no fast forward button. It's easy enough to click through everything rapidly, BUT it woulda been nice to just have a fast forward button either way. Like I said, very slight issue. \n\nAnyway, for 15 bucks, I'd say it's very worth it for a nice cozy visual novel. I got about 9 hours of it, and got all the endings, so I'd say that's pretty decent. I believe this game only goes on sale about once a year and its only 5 dollars off, so its up to you if you want to wait for it or not, but I think 15 is a great price. \n\nI'm really hoping for a sequel.

That's debateable)[/spoiler]\n- The day mechanic makes no sense to me, you can spend an entire day at one location having a conversation and spend a day there, but you can go there again and have a slightly shorter conversation and not waste a day, it's not that I hate the mechanic it's just that it makes no sense to me\n- There was some static with loading screens that lagged, but that's just a nitpick\n- Can't skip entire events instead you have to keep on clicking, which becomes very tedious when replaying the game\n\nOverall, I really liked Aviary Attorney.

From there starts the Investigation for Clues/Evidences before the Trial Day comes. \n\nYou carry a Wallet with some Money for buying/bribing Persons for Info/Evidences. If you solve Cases, you get Payment. Otherwise you can earn Money by playing a Card Game in the Student Tavern.\n\nWhen the Investigation begins, there are 2 major differences:\n\n1) Visiting Places costs Time (1 Day) and sometimes you cannot visit all places for a Search. Choosing wrong Places or simply waste Time will end with not enough Evidence for the Trial. This can result in a GUILTY Verdict for the defending Client. In the Ace Attorney Series, the Game will only let you proceed if you have collected everything possible.\n\n2) Throughout the Game you will be faced with many Decisions to be made. Most of the Decisions will alter the Story and influence where you will end in the last Act. In the Ace Attorney Series, the Outcome is always the same, so you cannot influence the Story at how it proceeds.\n\nUnlike the Ace Attorney Games you can lose the Game for not having enough Evidences before Trial or/and choosing wrong Answers/Decisions. You can always reload an Act and even pick the desired Day, so no skipping endless Texts until you reach a Decision Point.\n\nThe Courtroom Part is nearly identical. Witness will state a Testimony -> Cross Examination -> find the Objection hidden in the Testimony -> rinse and repeat until final Verdict from Judge and Jury.\n\nHere are some of my + / o / - Points:\n\nPositive:\n-Fantastic Artwork and Designs, which gives off a \"Classy\" Atmosphere\n-Good Orchestral Soundtrack which fully supports the Art Design\n-Serious Story with dark Undertones\n-Funny Sidekick which assists the Protagonist in many different Ways\n-Most Animals have Jobs or Personality which supports/contradicts their Character (Example: A Donkey as an arrogant all-knowing Librarian, A Fox who works as a cunning Private Investigator, etc.)\n-Decisions during In-game can alter the Story and its End (3 different Endings)\n-Finding Errors in Witnesses Testimony through Evidence are logically built\n-Many Possibilities to gather Evidence/Infos through Gifts, Bribing, etc.\n-Visiting Places costs Time, therefore making it crucial to decide where to go next\n-It's possible to lose Cases if not enough Evidences are gathered\n-Possibility to load previous Acts and all of its Days!\n-Card Game for earning more Money\n\nNeutral:\n-No Possibility to access Inventory, etc. while on the City Map\n-You can earn more Money through playing a Game at the Student Tavern to avoid Shortage, but it's not that difficult if you keep winning the Cases\n-Casual Cinematics which can be accessed from the City Map (only on specific Points and optional), can sometimes contain Spoiler\n-French Words/Places/Persons can sometimes be confusing\n-No Steam Overlay\n\nNegative:\n-Only 4 Acts\n-Short Duration of the Game (5-8 Hours)\n-Memory Leak Bug during my Play (Fullscreen)\n-No Skip Button during Texts if you want to reach certain Points\n-Some Decisions (Example: Tell Truth/Lie) aren't really Decisions, since Sparrowson will interrupt if choosed wrong and decide the \"right\" Course\n\nFazit:\nWhat caught me primarily, was the Artdesign. I love it and the Characters inhabiting this alternate World.\nAce Attorney Fans will get a familiar but very different Experience. \nMy real Negative Point, was the short Duration for this Game. Could have been longer, but just take it as it is.\nFor those who like also Visual Novels with Decisions, can't make a bad \"Decision\" with this Game ;)", "timestamp_created": 1480959222, "timestamp_updated": 1480959233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504366", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28148795": {"recommendationid": "28148795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138224197", "num_games_owned": 337, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480719079}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game.

I guess there are at least 2 endings of each case. I was shocked by the twist of the 1st case, when I thought I was clever and got all puzzles solved. In each case file, you will encounter twists more than once, which is extremely fun.\n\nMoreover, the writer has farther sights than detective stories.

I bought and played the game well after its initial release, so I didn't deal with the whole mess of the game being released in incomplete form, although that's definitely not a plus for Sketchy Logic. My biggest problems with the game are:\n-- The abrupt tone shift 2/3 of the way through the game, combined with almost completely railroaded writing. There are lots of choices that would appear to be poignant, and the game description says \"Decisions have consequences!\" -- but it turns out that only two or three decisions in the entire game actually do have any effect on the game or the endings. Then, after playing a relatively lighthearted story for a few hours, suddenly you end up in something much more grim and gritty. Also, the main characters' behaviors stop making any sense, and your \"choices\" don't even maintain the illusion of story impact. \n-- There are multiple endings, but replaying is much more difficult than it needs to be. There's an option to go back to previous saves, but it's clunky and I'm not convinced of its accuracy. There's also no real option for speeding through cinemas or dialogue.\n-- The game is very short for the price. I don't mind this in games where the experience is short but high-quality. This isn't one of those games.\n\nThe game's worth a few bucks for the laughs, the art, and the music.", "timestamp_created": 1472861133, "timestamp_updated": 1472861133, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556665", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25291491": {"recommendationid": "25291491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046430399", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474797444}, "language": "english", "review": "The writing's impeccable, the characters are lovable and the story is reactive to both your conscious choices and actions.

The art style is gorgeous. The characters are... distinct. Yeah, I'll stick with that. The first case is passable. But it goes downhill from there.\nEDIT: also the music is amazing.\n\nNow to talk about what I don't like. The branching path endings are basically to tack on more content. None of the multiple endings are interesting or all that well developed for me to care about. The characters are not memorable at all. While eccentric like in the Ace Attorney series, they aren't much beyond that. Their motives are simply and don't lead to any greater thought or speculation. Having animals as the \"people\" is amusing for the first 20 seconds.\n\nThe main character is a block of wood. Absolutely forgettable. They try to give him some intrigue as he has a reason why he changed his name... but I'll just tell you it's really lame. Not going to spoil it for you, but it's weak.\n\nThe side-bird is a block of wood... but with a flower painted on it. He's not interesting, but he tells some Dad jokes that are sometimes amusing. The effect they use to draw attention to his jokes gets tired after the first or second time they use it.\n\nThe main prosecutor is reminiscent of Miles Edgeworth of the Ace Attorney series, but lacks meaningful character development. If they developed him a bit more, I'd love him.\n\nThe investigation setup is gimmicky. Budgeting time makes sense. However, it is bullshit because knowing what you will need to do on a certain day requires miraculously looking into the future and knowing what testimonies will come up. No days can be wasted. And in the last chapter, they basically just tell you where to go. The court sections are way too simple. Rarely does it require more than two brain cells and a few pieces of evidence to advance. Whereas in Ace Attorney, these were marathons of presenting evidence and actually figuring things out. \n\nI often compare this game to Ace Attorney because that's where this game draws a lot of inspiration from. And in nearly all respects, it falls flat on its face.\n\nI really wanted to like this game. An Ace Attorney-like game on Steam was a dream come true. With BIRDS!\n\nBut sadly, this game is okay at best. They should have focused on making one cohesive narrative with better developed characters instead of a branching paths system with bland characters.\n\nRating: 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1472243189, "timestamp_updated": 1472243309, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499037", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25155060": {"recommendationid": "25155060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159961615", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456082209}, "language": "english", "review": "The ending seems a bit rushed, but the overall experience was really great.", "timestamp_created": 1472184741, "timestamp_updated": 1472184741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499349", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25099758": {"recommendationid": "25099758", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976973986", "num_games_owned": 3375, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477354405}, "language": "english", "review": "It's more than just a play on the Pheonix Wright games.

Sparrowson is at the heart of most of this hilarity, so it should come with no surprise that I felt his presence most acute and most memorable, from the puns (oh they are many in number) to his obsession with food; and for that, even a bumbling lackey as he may be, and for all the other slightly forgettable characters which come and go, I can only express my absolute approval and recommendation of this game. \n--\n\nI'll try not to dillydally, so huge disclaimer: I've never played Ace Attorney. Therefore, I cannot speak from the perspective of an AA veteran on its relative difficulty, and what features it might borrow or drop.\n\nThe game moves quickly, and it will progress with or without you. There's a city map to travel around to gather your clues in your own free time, but if you miss something critical\u2014tough luck. I enjoyed this aspect, as much as I'm sure others might be infuriated by it. It was one way to force critical thinking, even if one needn't wade far from the shallow end to arrive at the correct conclusion. Aside from that, it is pretty standard and the trial process is very easy to understand for a novice defense attorney such as myself. It's also quite convenient that time stops whenever you need to make an important decision (how I wish that was the case in real life).\n\nVisuals and sound is famously crafted from public domain, so if you enjoy the works of J.J. Grandville, and the romantic pieces of Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns and his contemporaries, then this department should warrant no further scrutiny. I'm sure you'd not be reading this if none of that appealed to you in the first place.\n\nSo in short, Con(s): Short! (Seven hours approx. between multiple endings and a sizeable AFK session), and (for the most part) Easy; the story is intriguing and fun-filled, but the few cases you do get liberty in are only difficult because you run out of time trying to acquire a piece of evidence in a specific order, or on a particular date.\n\nPro(s): Everything else, honestly.

Enough has been said about the art and music, so this review will just cover the bits that aren't obvious from screenshots.\n\nTHE GOOD: Excellent characterization and a very polished story. Some choices from previous cases have an impact on future ones. The puzzles are very straightforward and logical; no extreme leaps of logic are required (but see below). There are three possible endings.\n\nTHE BAD: Gameplay isn't up to the standards of its inspiration. The designers have attempted to \"fill the gaps\" by introducing time-management and money-management mechanics, but this has the side effect of punishing the player for not knowing ahead of time where to go and what to do, even though it is not always obvious. The trials are extremely short; there's only one multi-day trial. In general, the game is a bit too easy; there are virtually none of the \"aha!\" moments which are the mark of a really good adventure-game puzzle. \n\nTHE VERDICT: This bird is a little undernourished, but still worth the price, especially if you appreciate a well-crafted yarn and don't mind a lack of challenge.

The court cases themselves will probably feel a little too short and simple for veterans of the Ace Attorney franchise, but the (sometimes unforgiving) time limits in the investigation phase provide an extra challenge that helps make up for it. The game is also more than willing to let you lose your cases, which both ups the stakes a tad and provides some extra replay value in getting all of the trials' possible outcomes. The branching cases at the end are also executed well; I've only played two so far but I'm impressed by how different they are. Too many times visual novels bost \"multiple endings\" that barely differ, but this one actually delivers. \n\nI only noticed two small issues.

The game oozes charm with it's witty writing and unique visual style making it quite an enjoyable and entertaining playthrough. Unfortunately even with 3 different endings the game is short and only clocks in at 6-8 hours max, plus its puzzles are fairly easy to solve. If you are a fan of the Ace Attorney series you will definitely enjoy the familiar gameplay and well crafted story. I myself am eager for additional cases and endings down the line. However, if you are turned off by Aviary Attorney's shortness and easy difficulty you may want to wait and pick it up on sale.\n\nPros:\n+ The story is well crafted and entertaining, with three incredibly varied endings.\n+ The writing is witty and well done. \n+ The visuals and sound are beautiful.\n+ An incredible cast of characters.\n+ The courtroom and crime scene investigation gameplay is just as fun as the Ace Attorney series.\n\nCons:\n- The game is short. It took me only 4 hours on my first playthrough and 6 hours to see every ending. \n- There is little replay value after completing all endings, save to make different choices for a few minor plot changes.\n- Easy courtroom and investigation puzzles. I had no problem procuring all necessary evidence on my first playthrough and faltered only once or twice in presenting wrong evidence.\n\nRecommended\n\nRating: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1459099096, "timestamp_updated": 1459099195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22040178": {"recommendationid": "22040178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116473025", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469846229}, "language": "english", "review": "Gorgeous game and beautifully written.

Stick with me, there's more to this, or this would be a thumbs-up.  \n\nThere's a good narrative, but the gameplay suffers for it.  The gameplay is immaterial for the first half of the game; while it's true that winning or losing a trial affects the game, it's a cosmetic difference in the end.  Nothing actually changes, you're not locked into or out of any ending.  There's a lot of promise here, with the time passing mechanic, the ability to miss evidence and lose lose trials and continue, and having a jury to convince, but the game shifts narrative gears after two cases and that opportunity is squandered.\n\nMy other big complaint is that the game deliberately attempts to evoke Ace Attorney, and does a poor job in practice.  The gameplay is incredibly shallow; you never have more than a couple handfuls of evidence, and the contradictions should be incredibly easy to spot for any veteran of the series.  The most likely thing to trip you up is the time mechanic.  It's also short.  I've got 4.4 hours on record; that's how long it takes to beat the game and get every ending.\n\nTruth be told, this would probably be better without what feels like a token amount of gameplay.  The narrative is interesting, and if you're looking for a good short story you could do worse.

The addition of a jurist system makes perfect sense and works well from a gameplay perspective as well.\n\nThat's not to there aren't faults though.

For those who have played Aviary Attorney, an image search of artist J. J. Grandville\u2019s name will show a lot of familiar characters who have been faithfully represented within the game. The use of composer Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns\u2019s works adds a congruity to the game\u2019s sonic identity that greatly enhances the experience.\n\nSolving the cases is mentally stimulating, and there are a few different endings for each case depending on the choices you make as you progress. The game\u2019s plot is intriguing and features a satisfying amount of twists and turns that pulls you into the story. And of course, the game is just really damn funny.

With a refreshing, underused setting of 19-th century France, beautiful artwork by J. J. Grandsville, and a musical score that ranges from whimsicall to outright epic, Aviary Attorney turns into an experience thatI had no idea that I had wanted previously. \n\nFor those who aren't familiar with the Ace Attorney-style detective games, here's a brief introduction: The main characters ar edefense atorneys, who have a new case brought upon them with each chapter. In the alloted days leading up to the trial, they must travel about the city in search of evidence so that their defendant may walk free from impending incarceration. The unique gameplay element that Aviary Attorney introduces is the ability to fail a case and have the story progress in spite of it. Because of this, the game allows you to re-load any given day within a chapter so the player may make new decisions and achieve a different outcome. This is really handy, considering that there are several subplots that can develop differently over the course of the first three chapters.\n\nOne of my favorite additions this game brings to the genre is its sense of scale. Aviary Attorney takes place in a society on the cusp of revolution. The meta-narrative of the game is presented not only in some of the major cases, but also in optional cutscenes that not only flesh out the world, but do so in a manner that helps present the story in a manner akin to a noir television serial.\nWithin the three possible endings you can achieve, it's very interesting to see how our characters will eveolve along with the plot. There's welcome character growth within each route that builds on previous cases in a different way. It's definitely one of the best introductions of consequence in a murder-mystery game.\n\nThis game is definitely worth it's price if you're itching for a new murder mystery series to explore.With the added ability to fail a given trial and have the story go on despite it, the game's ability to re-load any individual day of a case allows for an unexpected ammount of replayability.

More if you explore every path (I can recommend trying all three endings, they're amazing and very different from one another), less if you skip through it (don't).

The art style, which literally just involves pasting animal heads onto 1800's paintings, looks sharp and distinct and really helps you immerse yourself in this seemingly alternate-history 1840's France. The main cast makes for a memorable pair, and I was frankly sad to have to see them go when I finished up the game. Though it's all over pretty fast, it's a satisfying journey and can end in multiple ways, with three entirely distinct final chapters depending on your choices in the third act, all of which can come to different conclusions.\n\nWith the multiple finales to be explored, there's actually a pretty good amount of content here, even if I found some of the finales more interesting than others. One was just what I wanted, the other was surprisingly good even if it started out a bit grim, and the third just seemed a little too dark and out of tone with the rest of the game. Despite that, they were all fun to explore and worth playing through, even if sometimes their endings felt a bit abrupt. \n\nI really can't think of anything I disliked about this one, other than it being a bit short and sometimes not entirely clear where you should go to find your clues. It's possible to miss important pieces of evidence by failing to visit the places you can find them or screwing something up when you get there, and if you do manage to fail a case, the story continues on rather than making you replay it, which is good but I can imagine would be a lot less satisfying an experience. Though it might be funny to play it again and fail the early cases on purpose just to see what happens. \n\nIf you're a fan of visual novel kinds of things, and like murder mysteries and courtroom antics, then I hope you'll enjoy this one as much as I did.", "timestamp_created": 1455328283, "timestamp_updated": 1455328283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21165684": {"recommendationid": "21165684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037459286", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451444890}, "language": "english", "review": "I first bought tAvian attorney due to the humor factor and was pleasantly surprised at how well written and clever it was. The ways in which the different outcomes are achieved and the dialogue systems were well thought out. The storylines that were finished that is... sadly when you achieve one of the main story branches it states that the path is not yet finished and you have to step back a few days and try a different course of action. Not a good selling point for a supposedly non-early access game. That aside the game achieves what it sets out to do, create an Avian parody of Ace attorney. Mechanically the game works great. You travel around Paris in order to collect evidence and defend your client. There are several different locations you can travel to but traveling to most locations takes a whole day and you only have a certain amount of days before you must appear in court. This puts contraints on what you can do which makes matters seem more pressing. Avian Attorney really pushes you to actually investigate rather than blow money gambling on black jack (which is totally an option). the nice thing is if you missed a crucial piece of evidence you can always step back a day to get the ending you want. as I mentioned above the dialogue is also well written. There are so many different approaches you can take to obtain different forms of evidence or get past obstacles. will you bribe them or persuade them or just threaten to beat the shit out of them? the shear variety of choice within what is a relatively short storyline is the main draw for this game, well.. that and the glorious amount of Bird puns. all-in-all I give the game an 8/10 purely for being unfinished and me wanting even more of it!

For reference, I got through to ending B, and thought the ending couldn't get anymore perfect, so I stopped there.\n\nAnyways, Aviary Attorney is a charming, funny little game about anthropomorphic animals back in the Pre-Revolution days of France. You follow to main characters, the sardonic Jayjay Falcon and his quirky sidekick Sparrowson as they navigate through four trials whose destinations I will not spoil.\n\nYou go around the city collecting evidence from various sites, but before you start thinking this is Ace Attorney, there is a time limit, with many places requiring a full day to visit. With only days allowed for trials, it creates and interesting dilemma where not only do you have to figure out the best way to argue your client's case, but you have to find the most efficient path to getting the evidence you need, a path which is partially obscured to you. \n\nIn the trial itself, things roll simply enough. You spot inconsistincies during cross examinations, pikcing up pieces of evidence for the jury to ogle that contradicts what they said. This is a strange game, in that there seems to be ways to partially lose your cases, or at least, not completely win them. TThankfully, I did, but I saw playthroughs afterwards where people did not and still got through the story.\n\nAs for the characters and the plot, I loved the characters, the dialogue, and again, Storyline B is where I stopped playing because I simply thought that end was the best one for all parties involved. As you may have noted from my explanation, there is a crucial point in the story where you end up with three different ending trials. I rather liked the idea, but it also ties into my one problem with the game, to be exaplained after I talk about aesthetic.\n\nThe aesthetic was quite good, I especially like the artwork, and the music was very well done for the period it was set in. I really have no complaints here, beecause as someone who loves aesthetics done differently (Journey, Transistor, Darkest Dungeon, etc)  I give a gold star to hand drawn art and music that fits the topic at hand.\n\nThe only problem I have is cost. If you're like me and get the best ending right off the bat, you may feel no need to go on to discover the other two. This can lead to you clocking only a minute amount of hours in. However, I do like short games, so I can only complain so much, but buyer beware.\n\nAll in all though, the minor issue of cost aside, vry well done, and I hope to see more like this again.\n", "timestamp_created": 1455080118, "timestamp_updated": 1455080118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502358", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21080904": {"recommendationid": "21080904", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977839603", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483031970}, "language": "english", "review": "To my suprise a very immersive game :-) I usually stick to big title fps/rpgs.

Simply demonstrating reasonable doubt IS sufficient.\n\nIt's also notable that the investigation sections have an action limit: going to a location to investigate it takes a day, and wasting time can mean the difference between mere acquittal and catching the real culprit -- or even outright failure -- since the trials are on fixed days that can't be moved.\n\nBut failure actually isn't the end in Aviary Attorney.

Mind that I do rarely wright reviews (pun intended) and I really really want to see a sequel of this game. \n\nThat said, this game exceeded my expectations in many, many ways. I was at first quite happy to buy an Ace Attorney clone and to my uttermost surprise right on the second case this game seemed like it would fit on the \"pupil surpasses master\" category. I was correct.\n\nWhy should you buy it:\n\nIt's not only really well written and crafted, It feels way more dangerous than Ace Attorney. You see, the trials have dates, and you better get the job done of asking the right questions and collecting the correct evidence before the trial day otherwhise [b]you will go to court without the necessary assets to win the case [/b]. If you do a poor job at investigation phase, you will fail...\n...and that's the best part. Failing doesn't mean you will get a \"game over\" screen. There is a special case that might go in threee different paths depending on your performance and decisions. \n\nIt's a delightful twist to the Ace series, while it doesn't have a Bioware/Telltale range of storyline paths, it doesen't feels like you're been railed visual-novel style. The text is clever, the smart and non-lazy use of Creative Commons art works marvelously, the plot twists are quite twisty indeed and if you think this game is full of puns, well, you're wright (strike two). \nYou'll more than once think \"well, that escalated quickly\".\n\nAnd to end the \"why should you buy this\" rant: it's amazing how a pun-riddled game about antropomorphic animals performing mundane tasks can be quite a banquet for though.\n\nAnd don't worry about the  [b]CONS[/b], for they're few :\n- A little glitchy here and there, I particularly had a lot of trouble with sound and had to lower my sound config in order to have it working properly.\n- The interface is quite pretty looking but messy and non-intuitive sometimes. Examples: 1: there is a blackjack mini-game that would benefit a lot from a \"Replay\" button without the need to go through dialogue again in order to play it. 2 : The main map of the game is quite messy, sometimes it tries to prompt you with a special cinematic and the prompt has exactly the same color of the background so is quite easy to miss. Besides, it does not tell you the day the trial will occur, nor allows you to check your evidence and suspects folder.\n\n\nBuy this game wright now and you wont regret it (strike 3.

The main storyline only took me around 4 hours to complete, but my playtime double going through the game again to see alternate paths and the other two endings. Each trial has multiple outcomes that can affect the story in different ways ranging from a few small details to three distinct endings. The game has a lot more replayability to it than the linear Ace Attorney games, and that's not a knock against Ace Attorney either, the linearity allows the game to provide a much more in-depth story.\n\nThat's not to say the story in Aviary Attorney is lacking; far from it. What starts off as a silly bird-lawyering game escalates into a turbulent tale of rebellion and violence, with three potential outcomes. The game is far darker than Ace Attorney ever gets, and the scope of your actions is far more reaching than the relatively minimal stakes the Ace Attorney series sticks to. There's a variety of characters with interesting personality quirks and a good dose of humor as well, the game can still be fairly lighthearted at times, but going in expecting something as over-the-top silly as Ace Attorney would be a mistake.\n\nThe gameplay also differs a fair bit. For one, it's much more fast-paced. Investigations are done a day at a time, and you have a limited time to get everything done that you need done, making it possible to fail any trial if you don't have proper evidence (or simply present the wrong evidence too many times). The first case is fairly trivial to complete, but it's possible to miss some crucial details in the second case and the third case is actually quite strict as far as what you need to do to ensure a successful trial, while giving you more options than you'll know what to do with. There's a bit of a trial-and-error element but when you have a sense of what you're missing or what you did wrong, it's not too hard to put the pieces together and have a perfect case after only a replay or two. And replays can be done fairly quick as the text is all fast to skip.\n\nIf I were to have any real problems with the game, it would mostly come down to three issues. First, path 4A is a bit... awful, storywise. It forces one of the main characters way out of character to push an overly dramatic and hard to take seriously storyline, though since the player intentionally has to initiate this ending, perhaps it was done on purpose? Either way, I wouldn't consider this ending \"canon\", and it's only one of three. \n\nThe second issue is that there are a fair few instances of script breaking, where the game will have assumed an event took place even if it didn't. This tends to only occur if you intentionally try to screw up things though, and the only major script break I encountered was a result of intentionally failing the first case early, though there are certainly others to be found.\n\nThe third issue, and this is only a minor nitpick, is the price vs. length issue. 8 hours is what it took for me to experience the vast majority of what this game has to offer (some branching dialogue paths and two failure states I didn't achieve that wouldn't change much in the long run) and while it's not impossible that I'll revisit it in the future, it still feels either a tad short for the price or a tad overpriced for the length. \n\nBut I digress, anyways. It's a very well-made game with a great story, a unique and interesting art style, and there are bird puns. I quite enjoyed my experience with this game, in spite of the small issues I have with it.

Time waits for no man, and neither does Aviary Attorney, if you failed to pick up the crucial piece of evidence then you will be punished for it later. The story changes depending on your actions, a refreshing change from chronically linear games that inspired it.\n\n\nThe aesthetics of the game are a lovingly curated experience, the character art is from J.J. Grandville\u2019s \u201cThe Public and Private Life of Animals\u201d, the backgrounds and objects are from other period books, and even the font is old! The attention to detail is staggering, not a single piece looks out of place. Combine this with a lovely soundtrack comprised of music by romantic-era composer Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns and you have a gorgeous game straight out of 1840\u2019s Paris.\n\n\nHilarious to a fault when it wants to be and surprisingly dark when it needs to, you are playing a tense, pre-revolution Paris after all.

The details are beautiful and every new character/animal has a completely fresh design that is great to see.\n#3: The story itself is extremely interesting. Each case warms you up to the over-arching narrative that takes some detective-work on the player's part to piece together. Will all these facts collide in the developing Chapter 5? I hope so.\n#4: While hilarious, the story also takes itself quite seriously. One wrong move on the player's part could result in a death, not just a \"game over.\" In this spirit, the story is grounded in the very real setting of revolutionary France, allowing the history buffs a bit of a spree through tumultous times.\n#5: The so-called \"negative\" reviews of this game are actually worth a read, because most praise the game in the highest fashion. Some bird-brains just can't wait 5 days for one of 3 intricate endings to be polished and delivered. A miscommunication, at best. Having played all three endings (the delayed ending cannonically last, in my case), I would say it was well worth the short wait.\n\nThe Verdict:\nGUILTY of being a wonderful romp through mystery, art, wit, and great characters.

Though this seems like a lot of content, I was able to go through the game in approximately 8 hours at a leisurely pace. I have no doubts someone could get through this game in 5 or less hours. \n\nI will say this game has great music, art, and dialogue. You can definitely feel the love and effort that was given to these areas of the game and I loved it. It truly felt refreshing. \n\nThe story however is short and, in my opinion, a little lacking. All of the cases are quick and have rather simple scenerios. Especially Case 4, where investigation is streamlined and we are given short and simple endings. Case 3 probably took the longest but only because you have to go through it fully twice to get both the endings. \n\nNow, at it's modest price tag of 15$ (compared to Ace Attorney's 35$ on release) you get a comperable amount of time for your dollar. However, don't be expecting long/intricate cases or a thrilling plot. But do prepare to chuckle whenever Sparrowson speaks. \n", "timestamp_created": 1452154394, "timestamp_updated": 1452154394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20365643": {"recommendationid": "20365643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116224505", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452031237}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would accidentally send an innocent animal to death row again", "timestamp_created": 1452133724, "timestamp_updated": 1452133724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20363400": {"recommendationid": "20363400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000691950", "num_games_owned": 478, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452123637}, "language": "english", "review": "What a very short game that has a delightful artstyle and an interesting overarching story. \n\nHowever, one musn't charge $7.99 for a soundtrack that can be found on a Youtube Mix Playlist. \n\nIt's incredibly dubious, charging money for something that is Free for usage to the public, so in the espirt du Liberte, I scoff and call you an emperor Penguin. \n\nFinal thoughts: \nYou should wait until the game goes on sale, replayability is limited, however good enough to spend an afternoon with, moderate for a chuckle or three. \n\nPersonal Comments: I can smell the greed of the publisher from behind my computer screen. \n\nFinal Grade: \nB for The Game Itself\nSee me after class for a beating for making illicit profit from Public Use music.  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1452124310, "timestamp_updated": 1452124310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20362236": {"recommendationid": "20362236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035502051", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452121309}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is pretty good for lawyer nerds, and bird nerds.\nIt's a bit buggy, but the devs are working on fixing it and the game is good enough to simply ignore them (I didn't encounter many, none were gamebreaking that weren't already fixed)\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1452120341, "timestamp_updated": 1452120341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566112", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20361640": {"recommendationid": "20361640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087492023", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488055489}, "language": "english", "review": "bird lawyers", "timestamp_created": 1452118380, "timestamp_updated": 1452118380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498621", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20356449": {"recommendationid": "20356449", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994782386", "num_games_owned": 776, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451397790}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u044f\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0432 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430!\n\n\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0431\u044b, \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438: \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0443 \u044f\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0443 \u0430\u0434\u0432\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430;

Not that the game wasn't good before, but it was imcomplete prior to the update, which is worth mentioning.\n\nAnyway, with that out of the way, Aviary Attorney is a fantastic game with great art and writing. Characters have interesting anthropromorphic animal designs, the characters are likeable and memorable, and the dialogue is clever. Fans of the Ace Attorney series will definitely find a lot of similarities from that series in this game, but there are enough differences and new twists to make this game worth it. For example, there are branching paths (you can get three major endings in fact), and it is possible to fail cases and continue the game with your failure affecting various portions. Investigation segments are also a lot of fun due to having to choose carefully on where you choose to investigate. If you make poor choices, you might not get all the info and evidence necessary to save your client.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game, especially to fans of the Ace Attorney series.\n\nMy only complaint is the lack of sound effects for guns.

Yes, one of the variants of the final chapter is missing from the game at the time of writing. But it will probably be back in fairly soon and you don't have to pay for it, so I don't really see the issue. Also, you only get the particular version of the chapter if you fuck up the previous one. So, uh, don't do that, I guess. \n\nSpeaking of elephants in rooms, you may have noticed that all of the characters are animals. The art style is actually one of the game's strongest points. And I don't say that often. The fact that they're animals is hardly important to the plot, beyond a few puns and maybe cats clawing people to death. It's a neat way of having all the characters be visually distinct without resorting to shitty anime drawings. And despite the game being a visual novel, there are quite a few charming little animations to give things a bit more character.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty inventive, but sadly underutilised. It's like Ace Attorney, unsurprisingly. There's an investigation phase, where you talk to witnesses and look for clues, and then the trial phase, where you present evidence to contradict the witness' testimony. It's all very talky. The key difference with Aviary Attorney is the time limit during the investigation phase. Each place you investigate will take you a full day, and you have only a limited time before the trial starts. If you faff about going to the same locations too many times, or in the wrong order, you might not have all the clues ready for the trial. Which means you might not get the best possible ending.\n\nThis is something a lot of mystery games lack- an actual failure state. Too many allow you to click on everything until you find the solution. It's neat that the game doesn't patronise me by making the solution too obvious. \n\nIt's not all perfect though. I found the game to be pretty easy- I got the best ending for every case on my first try. I mean, it probably helps that I've played Ace Attorney and Danganronpa before, but even if you haven't, the game heavily hints at where to go next during the investigation phase, and the trial phase usually has fairly obvious contradictions. If you don't know what to do during the trial, just press every statement. Eventually, someone will say something like \"I bet you can't prove that the witness owns a massive blood stained knife\", at which point you present a bloody knife with their name signed on the handle. \n\nThe trials are also very short. There's only really two full trials to sink your teeth into. The first case is more of a tutorial and the fourth is just an excuse for some story. Not even particularly good story, the variant I ended up with (the one you get for succeeding in Act 3) was all about protecting a character the player doesn't care about. I can't really blame the developers, it's enough for the price tag, but I guess Ace Attorney has spoiled me into wanting more.\n\nBesides the last act the writing is actually pretty excellent. It's funny, and not just \"funny by video game humour standards\". Legitimately funny. It also completely avoids the common mistake VNs make of describing a thing we can already see because it's a VISUAL novel.\n\nIn short:\n\nPros:\n+Excellent writing\n+Unique art styles\n+Interesting investigations and trials\n+Likeable characters\n\nNegatives:\n-A little on the short side\n-Too easy\n-A few mild bugs\n-No log to reread dialogue that you might have missed\n-Slightly incomplete\n\nIn short, it's a unique game that's worth experiencing despite its flaws.

Can you get your clients off the hook or will they find their goose is cooked? Bird puns out of my system let's get down to it!\n\nGameplay is greatly inspired by the Phoenix Wright series. Anyone experienced in those games will easily understand how this game works. You'll wade through sticky tangled webs of court room drama. Scour the cobblestone streets and back alleys of Paris for clues, make decisions on whether or not to use less than legal methods to obtain evidence, examine witness testimony, use logic and deduction in order to put all the pieces together to present your case. All the while coming to discover serving \"justice\" can be a messy complex affair.\n\nThe first thing to probably hit you is the astounding whimiscal caricature artwork that's highlighted throughout the game. Along with the backgrounds that range from smoke ridden taverns, to that of genuine historic sites and palaces of 19th century Paris. The anthropomorphic characters make up wonderfully strange an beautiful imagery. The artistic style of Jean-Jacques Grandville very much stands out for it's ability to conjure up such fantastic characters. The background surroundings you find yourself in are mainly borrowed from old illustrations that you would find in ads, catalogs and publications of the time. Pairing these two together and piecing them into a story results in a remarkable great looking game.\n\nMusic consists of many wonderfully orchestrated classical scores. Including the very fitting and recognizable \"Funeral March Of A Marionette\" that many would recall from it's use in the Alfred Hitchcock television show. Everything sound wise fits in with the period and serves to enhance the dramatic tense undergoings of the court room. \n\nWriting and plot can make or break this type of game. Luckily the story is full of some great moments. Especially as you delve deeper into each case. The story likes to leave you with certain doubts by unfolding the dastardly truth along with the glaring cracks that make up our imperfect sense of justice. It leaves you with some thought provoking feelings as you consider the different possiblities and motives of each case you're assigned. The writer seems to make good choices as to when to inject humor and when to take itself more seriously. It keeps the over all atmosphere and tone to each scene consistant and immersive. Resisting falling into the trap of trying to hard to slap you in face with jokes, which can be tempting to do in this type of game. Nor does it always take itself to seriously and knows when to use timing to deliver a good joke.\n\nAll in all it's a very interesting game that any lover of adventures, visual novels, and of course Ace Attorney games will appreciate. I would personally rate Aviary Attorney overall as a 9 out of 10.

While the bugs are indeed plenty, they are rather minor. It is indeed true that one of the endings is flat out missing, but the endings are a rather small part of the game.\n\nThe art in the game is excellent. It is well implemented and characters are interesting. Veterans of Ace Attorney may find the few poses for each character a little disappointing, but it never feels as if the game could have used any specific additional pose. The backgrounds are quite excellent as well.\n\nThe music is quite nice and the voice bleeps are fitting and actually an improvement over the typical Ace Attorney ones, if only because of their larger variation and style.\n\nThe game is rather short. But so is the story. The length of the game matches the story well and it never feels as if the pacing is too slow or too fast. The price is however a bit too much for the length of the game.\n\nThe story is generally well written, even if short. However, the integration with the gameplay falters at times. The good ending is a bit of a meh deal, especially with the rather lacking investigation and trivial trial. It is a bit of a let down compared to the rest of the game. But aside from the ending, it is quite interesting. There is a good underlying story going on beneath the cases you take on and it is just right in intensity, you know it's there, but it's not screaming at you.\n\nThe main problem with the gameplay is the ability to bumble the investigation, ruining your chances at the trial. This game makes it obvious why the Ace Attorney games don't let you do that. It's not just \"oh dear, i am failing this trial\", but you also risk missing major parts of the story simply by never getting that far in the investigations.\n\nThe game has had a rather rough release, with poor testing and an obvious Christmas rush. Time will save the game, even if the developer has repeatedly proven themself unable to obey their own deadlines.\n\nOverall, do play this game.

By the way, when I say \"some people\" I have read comments from Steam reviews, reddit and other forums. Just so you know I'm not strawman-ing.\n\nFirst of all, I have very few qualms with the game. If you enjoyed Phoenix Wright, you will likely enjoy this. I especially love that there are multiple ways to end cases! The only things I do not like is the lack of fast text skipping (like the way you would hold shift to quickly skip through text in a visual novel) and how short the cases are. There are also some problems with sound balance, but it's not a big deal. On the merits of the game alone, I would happily reccommend this game.\n\nNow I'd like to write a little in the developer's defense: I was not part of the Kickstarter, so I cannot tell you how they communicated during that, however I think the current controversy is overblown. The first complaint I have heard is to do with bugs: as far as I know, the developers of this game have not made a game before. If you have made a game before, you would know that bug testing is an odd process. Often a developer simple cannot encounter the same bugs that a player will. They need a second set of eyes. To combat this, the devs should have released a build to their backers to test before release. I first played the game post patch and I have not encountered any bugs at all. I don't want to call anyone a liar, but the game isn't riddle with glitches at all. From the reviews around here you'd think is it, but I digress.\n\nThe second complaint I have seen is that the game was released unfinished. This is unacceptable. It is! However, with a little digging around, I found that the devs were way, way, way over budget and deadline. I understand why they would release it early. The big problem here is that they didn't initially say it was missing the last part. They have since changed this on the steam page. However, I do agree they should have been unfront about this in the first place. \n\nI have heard people say that they should have released it as early access, if they couldn't delay it. The devs said they were going to add the last part in a few days after release, so it would have been silly to stay in EA for such a short time. Unfortunately, this didn't turn out the way intended: we still do not have the final part as of the 4th of January. I'm giving the devs the benefit of the doubt and say that they didn't intend for this to happen. We already know that they were over-budget and past their hard deadline, so it's clear that this project has gone out of control. This really sucks for everyone, but the devs seem to be trying to make the best out of it. If they release it soon, I think they deserve some kind of forgiveness.\n\nI want to put my reason for defending these devs into perspective: they are first time devs. They do not know how this all works. The way I've seen people lamblasting them, you'd think this was all a big con. I've been following the devblog for Aviary Attorney for a long time and I can see they are people that are passionate about their game. I don't think they would have continued making the game after running out of money if this weren't true. They would have abandoned it or released it half finished. Yes, the game is unfinished, but it has the majority of its content and is not abandoned. I believe the devs deserve a second chance. They have messed up, but they have time yet to fix things. This mess is a real shame because Aviary Attorney is a lovely game. I've have really enjoyed playing it. I hope the devs can fix what's happened and restore their reputation.\n\nI am not writing this review because of hurt feelings, but because I think this game is great. I want this game to be remembered for it's gameplay and dialogue. I want it to be remembered because it's fun! \nI know this was a lot to write for a dev that, in some eyes, didn't deliver but this criticism seems overly harsh. I've seen AAA games release in far worse states that have been praised to heaven and back. Does this seem fair or right? Perhaps it isn't a fair comparison, but you can see the hypocrisy surely?\n\nThis is a small first time dev team and I think a little patience is needed. I hope the devs will tell us an honest estimate for the final part soon. If they don't delivery the final part soon this review will no longer be a recommendation, but for now?

I am well-aware that this game is incomplete. While releasing an incomplete game looks very unprofessional for a dev...I'm willing to let this one slide. I've only completed the first act so far. I played it as if this were the original Phoenix Wright, and the ending of this act proved that it was something different. Not only does the game have a lot of humor and charm, but it is surprising and works with the tropes of the game it's based off of very well.

So I may not be as helpful as others.\n\nA video of this piece can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSiIYKuvGL4&feature=youtu.be\n\nAviary Attorney unfolds in 19th century France, where an attorney named Jayjay Falcon and his petite assistant Sparrowson defend many anthropomorphic animals in the courtroom.  Or as Sparrowson abrasively states, \u201chelp people get away with criminal acts\u201d.  The duo investigate crime scenes and testimonies to craft a repertoire of evidence to defend their client.  And ultimately find the truth behind every illusive crime.\n\nThe writing is impeccable in Aviary Attorney.  It retains all the wit and courtroom drama of Ace Attorney with the banter of Hatoful Boyfriend.  Every joke had near flawless comedic timing and even after the 20th horse pun I was still in stitches.  The different acts follow different cases, and can each be played in 2-3 hours easily.  Through every character there\u2019s a voice that resonates when reading their dialogue, proving that the written word in visual novels can still resonate even without voice acting.\n\nAviary Attorney retains the artistic integrity of caricature artist, Jean Ignace Isidore G\u00e9rard Grandville.  Rather than the colorful hyper-realism of Hatoful Boyfriend, the artstyle in Aviary Attorney is predominantly weathered yellow backdrops with hand drawn character models overlayed.  If you\u2019ve ever played Phoenix Wright, the eccentric character models may pop into mind.  Aviary Attorney takes inspiration with this.  And combined with the anthropomorphic elements, it creates a great composition of colorful characters, even though it\u2019s pastels are black and white.  \n\nThe music in Aviary Attorney is composed by French 19th century artist Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, and its authenticity really brings the world to life.  With every orchestration reflecting the bourgeoisie atmosphere of early France.  It\u2019s a very great and smart decision to use pieces of the era instead of attempting to replicate the early art in an OST.\n\nAs a Visual novel, Aviary Attorney has very minimal gameplay besides menu navigations and pursuing through text. However, unlike most visual novels.  Aviary Attorney takes inspiration from one of the most renown visual novels in gaming history.  The GBA and DS classics, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney (which surprisingly didn\u2019t feature a feathered protagonist) from Capcom.  Aviary Attorney takes the formula of that first game, where after an introduction to the murder case you interview witnesses and examine crime scenes to gather crucial evidence.  Following your investigations, it\u2019s off to the courtroom.  Where you must use aforementioned evidence to seduce the jury to your side.  By combing over witness statements and contradicting affidavits with evidence you will gain the jury\u2019s mindshare, but by wasting their time you lose their enthusiasm with the person you\u2019re defending.  Getting over each obstacle and test with minimal dissatisfaction from the jury, will result in the real murderer revealing himself and your client will be saved from the guilty verdict.\n\nA hefty 25 hour game with multiple endings, Aviary Attorney fully justifies it\u2019s 15 dollar price tag.  I\u2019m not a big fan of Visual Novels, but Aviary Attorney is a great lampoon of the Ace Attorney formula with its interactivity.  This isn\u2019t to say that Aviary Attorney is a bad Visual Novel, the writing is astonishing and comedic.  While France has been depicted in Assassin\u2019s Creed, the music and art in Aviary Attorney bring the place and period to life in a way that is significantly pure.  The attention to detail the folks at Sketchy Logic have for the time period doubles in the respect they have for the history and time period.  Aviary Attorney is a compilation of great writing, art, music, and characters.

You'll be examining evidence, trying to find errors in cross examinations, and interviewing people of interest to try and put together the various cases and mysterys as they unvold into a bigger picture. What seperates Aviary Attorney though is a creative art style that you won't find anywhere else, with a cheeky and irreverent sense of humor. The game also better punishes you for your mistakes, if you miss a piece of evidence, or badger a witness too much, you won't restart the case, you'll move on to the next one with consequences that effect the remaining trails. This is unique and opens it up to multiple playthroughs with vastly branching stories, and creates a more complete experiance. As for the story, the characters are fun and memorable, and well deliver plenty of chuckles (albeit likely no full belly-laughs).\n\nThe big problem dosen't rear it's ugly head untill late in the game, in my first playthrough I reached a branch in the story where I had not gathered the correct evidence for an impromptu trail, resulting in a text screen that read something along the lines of \"Sorry, this ending is unfinished! Check back in two days!\" And the game crashed. \n\nNot that it's super relevant, but it's but more than two days, almost a week. \n\nNowhere on the store page does it advertise this being an uncomplete game, nor does it label it with a \"Steam Greenlight\" or \"Beta\" nomiker. This game had a kickstarter, and was delayed at least once, so why not wait the extra time and release the full game? I cannot reccomend purchasing this in the current condition (12/30/15), and possibly cannot reccomend a purchase even if this unfinished ending is patched in. This is lying to the customer, you NEED to advertise that your game is NOT finished, an improumptu text screen is simply NOT enough. Since this part of the game was almost 4 hours in, a refund was not possible, but if it had been I would have gotten one. Skethy Logic games needs to properly address this situation, as it is a dangerous practice in video gaming, and plagued what was otherwise an extremely pleasent experiance. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1451504663, "timestamp_updated": 1451504663, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513060", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20115932": {"recommendationid": "20115932", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999819734", "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452810494}, "language": "english", "review": "Note: This review was orginally negative before being changed to positive as a result of the 1.02 patch. I have saved the original review down below for future reference.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLet's get the obvious out of the way: Aviary Attorney is clearly inspired by Ace Attorney. Everything from the gameplay, the type of humor, the dialogue and courtroom sessions are incredibly similar to the Capcom classic. Hell, the initials of the two series are the same and I doubt that due to coincidence. \n\nIf you like Ace Attorney, I'll cut straight to the chase and say it: You'll probably like Aviary Attorney as well and it\u2019s worth your money.\n\nTo go into detail, the game functions very similarly to Ace Attorney. You get a client coming in to defend them from a crime, usually murder. Then you have several days to wander to different areas of Paris, interview witnesses, gather clues and generally stick your beak where it don't belong. At the end of that period, you have a trial where you cross examine witnesses, present evidence and find contradictions.\n\nSo far, so Ace Attorney, right? The similarities go deeper: The main character is a bumbling and struggling defense attorney with a puntastic assistant. The prosecutor for the first case is inept before being replaced by your hoity toity high class rival who delights in insulting your skill. Many characters debate the true meaning of \"Justice\"...etc. etc.\n\nSo what sets it apart? Why buy it when Ace Attorney 6 is announced.\n\nWell for one, there's no guarantee that Ace Attorney 6 will ever make it out west with the latest title in the series, The Great Ace Attorney, unlikely to ever release here so.....you don't have much of a choice.\n\nBut yes, there are some changes from the Capcom series that sets this title apart.\n\nThe most obvious is the art style. Aviary Attorney's most well known feature is that all the characters are anthropomorphic animals taken directly from the works of the 19th century French Caricaturist J.J Grandville. The art has been touched up in places, mostly to add animations such as blinking eyes and beaks/snouts/muzzles moving. They're not extensive by any means but are done quite seamlessly with a minimum amount of \"original\" artwork to fill in the blanks. (For example, one character pulls out a gun and a sharp eye can see that the outstretched arm's cross hatching isn't quite as detailed as the original art, indicating it\u2019s a new change for the sake of the animation).\n\nSome people might be turned off by the black and white visuals but I greatly enjoyed them as they gave a real picture book feel to the game and it\u2019s always nice to see a game that increases the appreciation for classic art.\n\nThis extends to the music in the game which is also lifted mostly from 19th Century French composers of the Romantic era such as Hector Berlioz and Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns (as well as some original tracks made by the game's composer) which sounds absolutely beautiful.\n\nWhen compared to Ace Attorney, the graphics in Capcom's offering are definitely better (though I like the style of Aviary's more) but the musical tracks are a no contest to Aviary Attorney, as much as I like the music in Ace.\n\nThis all fits in perfectly with the time setting of the game: 1848 Paris. If you know your history, you'll know that 1848 is a pivotal year for France and you will get embroiled in France's real life history one way or the other. (Err....but with some liberties taken of course. It's a game about anthropomorphic animals after all). \n\n\nBut how is the gameplay? I won't lie; the investigating and interviewing processes in Aviary Attorney are pretty simple. Especially when compared to the multiple games in which Ace Attorney has had to grow out its staple of gameplay mechanics (i.e., adding in forensics, multiple angles to a crime scene.....etc.). Due to being limited by using J.J Grandville's art, the creators couldn't create incredibly complex locations for the game's crimes and therefore, all the cases seem rather simple when compared to the genius of Shu Takumi's crime drama writing. Aviary Attorney has the very simple mechanic of simply talking to witnesses and clicking on various objects in the background to reveal items and even the latter is only in special locations designated for investigating.\n\nOverall, the game's cases are simpler and shorter than that of Ace Attorney. Still intriguing and interesting but not as good.\n\nBut Aviary Attorney has an ace up its sleeve, time and branching pathways. In Ace Attorney, it\u2019s not possible to advance unless you have all the evidence you need to win the upcoming trial. You can keep switching around the various locations available to you till you find that one person or one event that will propel the story forward.\n\nIn Aviary Attorney, when the game tells you \"The trial will commence in three days\" You're on the fucking clock. Visiting most locations will consume an entire day and if you overlook a piece of evidence or go to the wrong locations, you can very well end up in court short of the evidence you need to clear your client. This is most evident in Case #3 which can end up in three different case #4s depending on how well you utilized your time and dug for evidence. It is entirely possible to go to the wrong locations and fuck up the trial. Another possibility is you get a partial success. In case #2, you can clear your client but still not expose the real criminal, giving you partial success and access to case #3 regardless.\n\n On top of all this, you have a money system in the game. The main character (J.J Falcon) has a wallet to carry his francs in which he can spend on various items in the game. You can usually get around paying by bringing another item or by clever dialogue choices but the currency mechanic means you can just skip some of the tasks in the game if you wish (As J.J Falcon says when asked for money or food in exchange for an item \"I'm done with this fetch quest nonsense, just take the damn money\").\n\nOverall, Aviary Attorney isn't as good as Ace Attorney but does a lot of stuff that Capcom should really look at and implement into their series to break it from its linear structure. The writing Besides, Aviary Attorney is 15$ while Ace Attorney games are over double that so the shorter game time is justified by the discounted price.\n\nAs of the time of writing though, some bugs in the game remain. The steam overlay still does not work (A \"bug\" EA and Ubisoft will no doubt love to have), Saving is still not working (Saving and quitting sends you back to the last checkpoint, the beginning of the day) and achievements are still not implemented.\n\nThe devs have promised to fix these in addition to announcing a bonus chapter and a Linux version. So you might want to hold onto your francs if you these things bother you.\n\nSee you in court, monsieurs!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal Review\nPosted: 30th December\nPatch:1.01\nRating: Negative\n\nThis will revert to a positive review once the issues are resolved.\n\nAviary Attorney is an excellent, funny game with a unique aesthetic and as a detective/laywer game, it gives Ace Attorney a run for its money.\n\nBut at the moment, I can't recommend it. The game is incomplete.\n\nOne of the three endings is not implemented at all (It simply leads to a \"sorry! We're not finished with this branch yet!\" message)\n\nQuick save was removed in a patch due to buginess so you have to use the in game checkpoints.\n\nThere's no log for the dialog spoken so be careful of errant clicks.\n\nSteam overlay bizarelly does not work with the game so I can't take screenshots from Steam itself.\n\nIf the game was labelled early access, I would have given it a pass but at the moment it's marketed as version 1.01. A full title.\n\nHopefully, the devs will live up to their promise of an update in the very near future.", "timestamp_created": 1451486362, "timestamp_updated": 1453324498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20106547": {"recommendationid": "20106547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057113817", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451462502}, "language": "english", "review": "The King of France is a penguin.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1451462772, "timestamp_updated": 1451462772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20104442": {"recommendationid": "20104442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045752399", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452484710}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1451455850, "timestamp_updated": 1451455850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20103049": {"recommendationid": "20103049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013591022", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451450952}, "language": "english", "review": "Bird-up!", "timestamp_created": 1451451338, "timestamp_updated": 1451451338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.996431", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20102221": {"recommendationid": "20102221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054819528", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451498460}, "language": "english", "review": "The art is incredible,\nThe music relaxing,\nAnd the story sweet and funny.\n\nIt feels like i am partaking in a Beatrix Potter story and i love it. \u2665", "timestamp_created": 1451448752, "timestamp_updated": 1451448752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502745", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20102103": {"recommendationid": "20102103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052517996", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451635946}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to start by saying that I love the visual style of this game, and it got me into playing an attorney game even though I'd never played one before. The writing is cute and engaging, and the characters can be a lot of fun.\n\nBut on the whole, I've found the game disappointingly buggy. Sometimes it's just that the dialogue options haven't been thought through properly (for instance, if you need to choose a character from the list of characters you know to accuse of something or to ask about, and you choose the wrong person for the storyline, the characters will say something like 'Who is that person?' even if it was a friend of theirs, which makes things very confusing for the player, since you start worrying you pressed the wrong button or something). Once, in Act 3, I asked about an unimportant piece of data and midway through discussing it the dialogue skipped back to a previous conversation on a different subject.\n\nSometimes the bugs are bigger. It's already been noted that depending on how you play through, Act 4 may not be accessible to you at all. I made a mistake in Act 3 and Act 4 isn't accessible to me, so I went back to play from Act 2, but when I try to load Day 1 of Act 2, it bugs out and gives me an illustration, but no characters or dialogue and I can't move forward. I feel that this game has a pretty hefty price for mostly text-based gameplay if it's going to have this many game-halting problems with it. It's not just the unfinished Act 4, there are a number of serious and confusing problems that really affect the experience or sometimes terminate it altogether. Especially if the game is going to be so unforgiving (going to a location that I had a lead for a day earlier than I was apparently supposed to caused me to fail my goal in Act 2), and going to halt your progress if you make certain decisions, then it really needs to be able to reload properly from previous days.\n\nI think this game could be really great, but it's lacking polish and completion in several serious areas, so at the moment I don't think it can be said to be worth $15 or even $13.", "timestamp_created": 1451448414, "timestamp_updated": 1451448414, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588155", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20098973": {"recommendationid": "20098973", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971150596", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454826220}, "language": "english", "review": "Edit: Looks like they've finally finished the game.

I found this game on kickstarter when it was just about to be funded. I have been a fan of Phoenix Wright ever since it first came out for the Nintendo DS, and have played every title up to now multiple times. So when I saw this game I thought that having a new set of characters in a new universe with the same game formula, that it could definitely be something special. First off, the art and the music of the game are absolutely fantastic. The art and the music are definitely some of what my favorite parts of the game is. As a Phoenix Wright fan, the gameplay itself does not quite amount to the same level of depth found in Phoenix Wright, nonetheless the addition of a limited amount of time make the game feel original while still retaining enough elements from the game to please old fans as well as newcomers. \n\nThere are ways the game could be improved. First, the game is painfully short. In under 3 hours I had unlocked both endings, as well as seen the multiple ways each case could have ended. The story seems rushed and ends in a whimper in a horiffically anticlimatic way. The first two cases were absolutely wonderful but the final act seemed to be put out before it was ready which leads to a poor finale. \n\nAll in all, the game was is $15, and I will say that you get what you pay for, it took up an evening that I enjoyed and I will probably replay it again, but I think that this game would do well with some additional content as it is lacking greatly.", "timestamp_created": 1451374230, "timestamp_updated": 1451374230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20059711": {"recommendationid": "20059711", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995924857", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454676065}, "language": "english", "review": "I am loving the game so far....only thing is ....I ran out of content for now (played for 3 hours).", "timestamp_created": 1451373802, "timestamp_updated": 1451373802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20059100": {"recommendationid": "20059100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082514104", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453600201}, "language": "english", "review": "I backed this game on kickstarter so was pretty keen to play this game. I didn't have very high hopes from reading the kickstarter updates that the quality of script writing and illustrations would be up to scratch. But, was completely wrong about that.

If you have played Ace Attourney games Ill happily recommend this to you. It has the similar charm and wit, although unlike Ace Attourney you seem to actualy have a time limit. And a lawyer who actualy seems to know about court etiquette and rules. \n\nAlso the investigation parts wandering around Paris provide a refressing chance to screw up. You could simply use too many days simply playing Blackjack in the tavern. Or maybe you missclicked and ended the investigation inside your current location.\n\nHeres a quick summary of the positives and negatives\n\n+ Wonderful artstyle. \nJean Jaques Grandevilles 18th century art comes alive and the animal characters fit the story.\n\n+ Music is fantastic. \nClassical music fiths the 18th century like chocolate on a croissant\n\n+The story is intriguing. \nThe different cases in the game provide decent variety in terms of turns and events. The game managed to even surprise me when I was in a too Ace Attourney way of thinking.\n\n-The game is woefully short. \nI completed my first playthrough in 5.6 hours according to steam. Even that time had few breaks where the game was left running. This is the greatest negative to the game. As a single case in later Ace Attourney games could easily last that amount of time by itself. Provided you take your time.\n\n-The ending was a bit....anti climactic.\n In the 4th case I was in the B route. And it left me...Wanting more. Or a more epic conclusion.\n\nThese negatives dont outright ruin the game. But you should keep them in mind still. Nevertheless I enjoyed my time with JayJay and Sparrowson and I am looking forward to any possible continuation of their story.

While I am unaware of the budget and how much kickstarter backed them with, The game is awfully short for something that costs so much. Half the price would be suitable for a mere 7 hours of gameplay (and at least an hour dedicated to going back and finding the right evidence on multiple occasions to get the ending I wanted). There are typos, like the mispelling of irony to point one out, so maybe a little more care could have been put into that. (though im sure there will be a patch for that soon)\nOn that note too, the difficulty spike in chapter 3 was not expected either! Being an Ace Attorney veteran, I didn't expect you to be able to proceed without all evidence. At one point it was frustrating though and I did consider looking it up.

There are some significant and insignificant bugs and typos at the time of this writing (December 27th, 2015), but the package as a whole is more than good enough for me to forgive some rough edges. (Pro tip: don\u2019t adjust options at the title screen. Wait until you\u2019re in the game proper. I had to uninstall and reinstall the game a few times until I figured out that was what was making it stop responding to me.)\n\nIt\u2019s a visual novel about lawyers practicing in 19th Century France, except everyone is a creature from the illustrations of 19th Century satirist J. J. Grandville, set to music by the romantic era composer Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns.\n\nThe whole thing has a very Hatoful Boyfriend kind of feel to it, and not just because of the static images or the birds: this is a game that has a completely ridiculous premise and uses that to draw the player in to a grim tale of political strife, asking questions about justice and revenge. Parts of it seem to be direct responses to Ace Attorney scenes, too - a lot of Ace Attorney moments get flipped on their heads here.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say it isn\u2019t really funny when it wants to be - it\u2019s freaking hilarious when it feels like it! That\u2019s another thing that feels really Hatoful Boyfriend about the whole proceeding, but it\u2019s certainly its own thing, and it got its talons in me really deep.

All in all it will be best to wait to purchase this game until the developers release the debugged and complete version.\n\nAA is a fun playthrough for fans of both of the game's major inspirations (Phoenix Wright/Ace Attorney and Hatoful Boyfriend). It has its fair share of comedy and puns (although many of the puns will require minimal knowledge of the French language), and in the later half of the game, it has a great original overarching plot centering around the setting of pre-revolution France. The game also features a great original classical soundtrack and engaging graphics styled around 19th century etchings and caricatures.\n\nAt the moment, the game remains incomplete though, and this makes is a bit hard to recommend the game, especially with the high price point (for a short visual novel). The first half of the game will feel boring to Phoenix Wright players, as it nearly carbon copies the first Phoenix Wright game through the first two cases. Many bugs abound in the game that make it hard to understand why it was released (do not open the options menu from the title screen, and the save system is a mess). While the game boasts three endings, one of them is listed as \"Coming Soon\" and there is little knowledge as to whether this means pay-to-play DLC, a forthcoming update, or that it will ever come at all.\n\nShould the bugs be worked out and the game completed, it's well worth your time and money.

For starters, the player is expected to work out the best part of the city to investigate each day before a case. You get between 3 days to 2 weeks to perform a cursory investigation for each case, and you have to make sure each day counts. This had its ups and downs to me, since at times I felt I wasn't psychic enough to know the best sequence of locations to visit. For what it's worth, the game allows you to rewind to any previous day very easily, but it may mean skipping through dialog.\n\nTheir better improvement is in cross examinations. Rather than scrolling through a series of statements and blindly presenting one piece of evidence as \"contradicting\" it (a simple gameplay rule that Phoenix Wright breaks at times) the witness's testimony is shown as one paragraph on a sheet, and JayJay underlines a few statements he can ask about. When you do, you get a few choices about topic; delving too far on an unrelated line can cause you to lose favor with the jury, whereas you will need to delve if you think you've found a subject that you can present contradictory evidence for.\n\nFor fans of Ace Attorney, this is surely a game to try out. If it has one failing, it's one that lots of small-time adventure games seem to fall into, in which later in the game, the gameplay begins to serve the storyline, rather than the other way around. For the last 30 minutes of the game or so you'll likely just be progressing dialog and picking obvious location/evidence choices rather than unravelling a complicated murder mystery. However, I happened to only do one of several options that led to this - It turns out that your actions in Case 3 can actually cause the final case to happen in one of several ways.

Living in harmony with all different types of animals, including lions, wolves and others, in a civilized yet corrupt Paris\n\nThe game takes place in France just before another French Revolution is being plotted underneath in the catacombs of Paris. You play Falcon, a lawyer with a dogdy family background and your bubbling sidekick Sparrowson who together have to defend their client in question in a court of law\n\nThe game's mechanics do follow heavily that of Capcom's classic, Ace Attorney, as you have to go and gather evidence, find any loopholes in the verdict and cross examine witnesses. The story does take a turn half way and deviates from this system\n\nThe game is text based game with wonderful hand drawn environments, however, seeing this colourless, black and white environments does get boring after a while. The story is well written and has huge amounts of comedy and references to modern day pop culture\n\nThe only things I found a bit off were the small amounts of spelling and grammatical mistakes, as well as no support for the Steam overlay and some other missing features, such as achievements and a missing ending which is to be finished in an upcoming update\n\nOverall, Aviary Attorney is a brilliant game which deals with the changes that were occuring during the French Revolution, as well as before and after. This game had me hooked so much that I finished the game in one whole sitting! Which is very rare in my case.

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of Indie Mystery Visual-Novel, Aviary Attorney. Aviary Attorney was released on Steam on December 21, 2015 by Developer/Publisher Sketchy Logic.\n\n(NOTE: This game was NOT reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher, it was a game from my own account)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FSbcrZv4Y_c\n\nThe \"Too Long, Didn't Watch\" Review:\n\nGreat fun, hilarious, beautiful. Top-Notch Visual Novel. 5/5 (despite the GLARINGLY obvious rush at release)\n\nThe \"Meat & Potatoes\" Review:\n\nThis game is simply gorgeous. That is probably the first thing you notice about Aviary Attorney overall. The music matches the art as well, simply beautiful. I have never played either Hatoful or Pheonix Wright, so most of the \"comparisons\" I am seeing do not mean much and felt like I could give a fresh perspective to this game. I was once studying to be an attorney (my \"Clark Kent\" still works Gov't) so felt immediately drawn to this. IT also happen to help that I absolutely LOVE horrible puns. If you do not, you may want to just walk away now. Not from the review, just from the game entirely. However, I find it absolutely hilarious. The dialogue and writing overall is superb, the art is beautiful, the piano is divine. This is everything a solid VN should be. The story is truly engaging and fun. An ending was unavailable at release, and release was delayed a few days. I attempted to get a hold of the reviewer for a key, and was unsuccessful. Clearly, they were overwhelmed in their attempts to meet their own deadline. I have seen complaints, but honestly they obviously cared enough to work EXTRA hard in the days up to, and since launch. That dedication to their product is a good thing. Does it suck that they missed their goal by a couple/few days? Sure. It seemed to be more out of a desire to release the best product they could and they continue to improve to this day (there have already been updates). Give this one a go. I fully endorse it and am loving every minute. Several LOL moments. Fans of any type of Visual Novel will enjoy this for sure, as will anyone with a good sense of humor. If action is what you want, you may not find it here. Tons of \"Pros\" and short on \"Cons\", this VN is truly worth the $15 pricetag. A true 5/5 for this gamer.\n\nHappy Gaming!", "timestamp_created": 1451178366, "timestamp_updated": 1451178385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.430097", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19979637": {"recommendationid": "19979637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043902125", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451176600}, "language": "english", "review": "surprisingly good", "timestamp_created": 1451175931, "timestamp_updated": 1451175931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.981901", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19977612": {"recommendationid": "19977612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038075886", "num_games_owned": 502, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451157495}, "language": "english", "review": "If you buy Aviary Attorney - which you should - expect a witty, fun, and generally amazing game with a fantastic plot.

Every investigation and action does influence the outcome of court proceedings and/or story, which may prove to be tricky as time is limited and investigation choices increase as chapter goes that one is never sure which one is a false lead/useful lead (unless you are using a guide). Also, the 4th case is dependent on your actions in case 3, and there are 3 alternative cases (with 1 of them being unreleased). The storyline is a tad short, but surprisingly complex and intriguing as it revolves around the grey area of law (the ending of the first case does gut the heart already) and the meaning of justice. If you aren't inclined of the animal characters but wants to know whether the story is worth it, then AA will not disappoint.\n\nHowever, there are a few notable drawbacks. First being that there are a few typos in-game. They're relatively minor and few, but it'd be nice if the game is a wee polished. Also, saving in the middle of a conversation seems impossible; if one \"Save and Quit\" during a convo, it usually loads from when the scene started. And lastly, one of the ending paths (4C) is incomplete, resulting in lots of complaints and negative feedback (expected release date: 29th Dec 2015). There has been a few bug reports on game blackout, but I encountered none so far. My only complaint is the inability to share screenshot, though it's unsure whether the game has disabled screenshot or it's my setting problem (because there has been people who have posted screenies).\n\nNevertheless, apart from the few drawbacks, the game is mostly interesting and is worth the purchase imo. AA is easily completed within 5~8 hours. (And yes, please ignore my game time.

The art is stupendous, the story maybe not as complicated, but these people need to hit their stride, and they can do something great with this. Maybe not 10 games worth, but maybe a sequel or something better.\nAnyway, the music is great, the characters are charming. Is it buggy?

If you've never played them before, the general gist of it is that you're a lawyer defending a client, and to do so you investigate the scene of the crime, gather evidence and interrogate witnesses, and on court day use said evidence to attempt to get your client a \"not guilty\" verdict.\n\nSo compared to reality not really lawyer-like work at all, but as in this game you're playing as anthropomorphized bird Mssr. JayJay Falcon, you'll probably want to suspend your disbelief. Set in 1800s France, with old-timey art from J. J. Grandville to match, Aviary Attorney's presentation is simple but charming. The characters aren't voiced, but have different-toned blips to indicate who is speaking.\n\nGameplay-wise, Aviary Attorney is almost more of a visual novel. While you do travel from place to place to find clues and talk to people, there isn't as much interaction as you'd typically find in an adventure game. The puzzles are fairly simple, which may serve to annoy more hardcore adventure gamers. There is a bit of pixel hunting to be had (exacerbated slightly by the fact that everything is black-on-sepia), but it's nothing annoying.\n\nThe story and characters go on to steal the show, though. With a liberal sprinkling of puns and good humor, I felt that the characterizations of the animals you interact with were very well done. The atmosphere of the game also does not veer into the spiritual, which I always thought was a (albeit quirky) weakness of the Ace Attorney games.\n\nAll that said, the game felt like it went by pretty quickly.

I recommend the game highly, you should get it. \n\nLet's look at the individual aspects though. \n\n[b]Playtime:[/b]\nMy playtime is accurate at 4.7 hours. I consider my playtime to be around average. I didn't scrounge for every single piece of dialogue, but I also had a slightly higher reading pace. If you have difficulties with logic puzzle games, this may be a bit longer as I think I figured out necessary actions fairly quickly.This will bring the total playtime to around 5 hours when the last route releases. I would consider that a respectable amount for the price point. \n\n[b]Music:[/b]\nThe music for the game is very solid. The soundtrack brings appropriate ambiance that fits both the story's setting of old France and it plays to the situation at hand. I was never jarred by off-putting choices of music at any point. My only criticism of the music is there wasn't any that felt catchy or memorable enough. I have no urge to open up the soundtrack to just listen to a particular song. \n\n[b]Visuals:[/b]\nThe visuals speak for themselves. Absolutely stunning and unique. From the backgrounds to the character art, the game looks great and I find myself eager to explore new zones just to see what they look like. Nothing to say here but praise. Great work. \n\n[b]Writing:[/b]\nHere's where the game gets really juicy. The game accomplishes what it tries to do perfectly. The humor in the game goes well beyond just puns and animal jokes. Exclamatory remarks, running jokes, and wordplay are all done with great timing and execution.\n\nThe characters themselves are indeed memorable and unique. No one felt like a copy of each other or even as adhering to an established character archetype. You will undoubtedly find a favorite among the cast. The character development is also quite nice as well, flowing naturally and without feeling forced. \n\nThe story is quite engaging and progresses. Your choices do matter and the chapters flow into one another, not standalone episodes. You follow the main character's story and see how far they will go. The conflicting ideologies presented in the game are quite well done. Both sides are presented fairly, neither being demonized, and you get to see some of the humanity behind each train of thought. I really love how they did this and I appreciate the writer's efforts. \n\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nIt's inevitable to talk about this game without talking about a certain other series. However, I wouldn't go so far as to say took mechanics and ideas, but it feels more like a love letter to a beloved memory. The gameplay is very good and separated into 2 main sections: trials and exploration. You explore, get evidence, and meet people to prepare for the upcoming trials. Your success in exploring will carry you through the trial. The game presents a very nice tutorial section that exposes you to all the mechanics before getting more and more complex in a very natural way. I would liken this to a logic puzzle, where common sense and intuition rule and will be your friend. I personally enjoyed the gameplay very much, and you probably will too if you're even just looking into the game to see what it's about. I will say, it will take more than one playthrough and some testing to try and get all the endings. \n\n\n[b]Closing remarks:[/b]\nIf the price point puts you off, don't worry about it. The game is worth the money and you're supporting the devs and their hard work. They need to eat too.\n\nThe game is also still being polished. During my first playthrough, I encountered a few bugs, but those were quickly patched out. The devs are responsive and looking to create a great experience. \n\nThe writing, gameplay, and art of the game are all astounding and some of the best I've seen out of a project like this. \n\nI look forward to the game's success, the future works of the devs, and maybe even a sequel if they're so kind.", "timestamp_created": 1450911523, "timestamp_updated": 1450946486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594513", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19889635": {"recommendationid": "19889635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047728479", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450998985}, "language": "english", "review": "This is, quite simply, the most engaging and entertaining game I've played in a long time.

On joue essentiellement avec un duo, l'avocat et son assistant, autrement dit deux personnages compl\u00e9mentaires.\nIl y a tout un background historique de la ville de Paris, avec des lieux embl\u00e9matiques comme la cath\u00e9drale ou le Louvre; on commence l'histoire en janvier 1848, et les passionn\u00e9s d'histoire reconna\u00eetront tout de suite une date cruciale dans l'histoire du XIX\u00e8me si\u00e8cle... Je n'en dis pas plus car c'est au centre du jeu, qui est divis\u00e9 en 4 actes tel une pi\u00e8ce de th\u00e9\u00e2tre. \nOn alterne entre investigations, interviews, proc\u00e8s et qu\u00eates secondaires. La seule chose frustrante, c'est lors des explorations : chaque jour, on doit se rendre dans un endroit de la carte suivant l'avancement de l'enqu\u00eate. Seulement, certains lieux peuvent \u00eatre visit\u00e9s plusieurs fois dans une journ\u00e9e, mais d'autres gaspillent une journ\u00e9e enti\u00e8re. Du coup, il faut choisir et parfois faire des sacrifices, notamment sur les qu\u00eates secondaires, pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer les preuves n\u00e9cessaires aux proc\u00e8s. Mais souvent, on a que trois jours pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer des preuves dans diff\u00e9rents endroits, avant le proc\u00e8s. D'o\u00f9 le probl\u00e8me du temps de visite d'un lieu.\nC'est aussi pourquoi j'esp\u00e8re qu'il y aura des mises \u00e0 jour r\u00e9guli\u00e8res pour apporter un peu plus de contenu, m\u00eame s'il existe plusieurs fins, a priori au moins deux. \nJe n'ai pas encore compris l'int\u00e9r\u00eat d'avoir une assembl\u00e9e de jur\u00e9s, dont on peut gagner ou perdre en faveur. Ils interviennent peu dans les proc\u00e8s. \nDans tous les cas, ce jeu m\u00e9rite d'\u00eatre fait et d'\u00eatre approfondi encore plus : peut-\u00eatre que les d\u00e9veloppeurs pourraient cr\u00e9er un \u00e9pisode qui se d\u00e9roulerait en 1871 ?... ;)", "timestamp_created": 1450906441, "timestamp_updated": 1450906441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586466", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19887447": {"recommendationid": "19887447", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990505519", "num_games_owned": 788, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484294321}, "language": "english", "review": "I have made it through the 2nd case and it has been good so far.

To compare it to Phoenix Wright it is about half the price and only about a 1/3 of the length. There is one more case to come in the far future as a bonus (it was a kickstarter stretch goal).

After this, you explore locales related to the crime, collecting evidence and testimony. Once that's done, you go to the courtroom and try to outwit the prosecutor by cross-examining witness testimonies with evidence.\nWhat sets this apart from the Ace Attorney series has to be the way that decisions make the game play out. A poorly worded sentence or illegally acquired evidence can bar you from a useful piece of information for the trial. Does this change the course of the trial? I'm not entirely sure, even after the first case, I want to go in for another go to get those pieces of evidence I couldn't get before.\nThe game gives off a great atmosphere. The art is superb and very reminiscent of Victorian-style ink drawings. Character portraits will move around the screen in conjunction with actual movement, which on paper sounds small, but in a visual novel-style game it helps to immerse you in what the characters are doing.\nThe writing is superb. There are some laugh-out-loud funny moments in here, which is an achievement in itself.\nTo be honest, I bought this game on a whim, being a bit of an avian fanatic. But I was not disappointed in what I got from this, and I have yet to play the full game, even.\n\nEDIT:\nI guess if there were one thing to comment on right now, the game doesn't seem to be 100% finished at this time.

Even in the city of lights darkness still festers. But there are those who stand against the rising tide of evil. Foremost amongst these bastions of hope is one man. Well okay maybe he isn't really up there in the scheme of things. And maybe he isn't technically a man, he's a falcon. But nonetheless he stands to see justice prevails in the heart of revolution.\n\nAviary Attorney is one of those games looks interesting but maybe you don't expect that much from.  However I'm very pleased to say that it's maybe one of the biggest surprise delights I've had all year.  The game play for Aviary Attorney falls somewhere in between Hatoful Boyfriend and Phoenix Wright. You must traipse through the streets of Paris searching for clues and evidence in order to prevail at court and let the truth out.\n\nHowever you mustn't let the rather simple outward appearance of the game's mechanics take your guard down. What seems like a straight forward search for the key piece of evidence and then compare it to the correct bit of testimony at court at first quickly reveals itself to be a much more complex and far darker plot. For perhaps obvious reasons I shan't go into any detail but suffice to say that there are more twists and turns in this plot than a particularly rotated piece of Fussili.\n\nYour own personal detective skills are tested as you must choose which leads to follow and which to drop, if pushing a potential witness will give you that vital information or push them away and choosing which location will give you valuable evidence. The game has you on a ticking clock meaning that the decisions that you make have real weight and it has no qualms about letting you miss vital bits of evidence that may prove your downfall in court. You are also limited in funds, some task will require that you acquire items or 'persuade' somebody a few franks changing wings can make this all the easier. More than once you know that there is some kind of connection but with only a limited amount of time and resources you simply cannot secure the evidence you require.\n\nAviary Attorney smashed my expectations. The writing is superbly witty and hilarious without relying on bird puns (though there are still of few of those for good measure) with gameplay that is far more complex than it might at first appear. The soundtracks pretty good too. The story is a great foray into trying to uphold justice against whatever force may try to stop you. Even the populous that you try to protect. After all, this is Paris. A revolution is never far away.\n", "timestamp_created": 1450818020, "timestamp_updated": 1450818020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500931", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19847881": {"recommendationid": "19847881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051953829", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463881410}, "language": "english", "review": "Beforehand, I have only had limited exposure to the game.

Going to certain locations takes up a day's time, and it is possible to lose favor with the jury by needlessly pressing on witness statements.

Games like Sonic the Hedgehog, Spyro the Dragon, and Crash Bandicoot all brought birds to the forefront of gaming entertainment with their colorful bird protagonists, hinting at a bright future for avian kind. But as console generations came and went, the medium's focus shifted, and birds were all but lost in the gaming spectrum. Thankfully, all is not lost, and thanks to sleeper hits like Hatoful Boyfriend and Penguins Arena and the popular Tropes vs. Birds video series by Tweeta Parakeetian, birds are back, and better than ever - which brings us to the latest in bird entertainment, Aviary Attorney.\n\nAvian Attorney is, as it says in the title, a game about birds practicing in the school of law - unlike its bird of a feather, Hatoful Boyfriend (which held its surprise so close to its plumage that even today most people still think it's a joke game about dating birds), this time it's just you, the birds, and the mysteries within. While it's not necessarily an original idea, predated by famous bird lawyer series Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law more than a decade ago, it provides a fresh perspective through its unique presentation, in both its art style and music.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Aviary Attorney will probably come as second nature to anyone familiar with the similarly named Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney series (which, despite its misleading title, is not about mystical birds). It's a visual novel with mystery elements, in which you travel between various locations gathering evidence leading up to a court trial. Unlike Phoenix Wright, however, travelling between most locations takes a day of your time, and you only have a certain amount of time before each court session begins, making you think more about where you need to go. There are four cases, with minor choices throughout the cases that lend to replayability (and frequently leave you wondering whether or not you've made a mistake), and the fourth case has 3 varients which are vary significantly both in story and length, and altogether the game lasted me around 7 hours. There are occasional bugs here and there, but the developer seems to be working hard to iron out the problems and in the time I've been playing it there have already been two small patches for it. If you're a fan of mystery games, particularly of the Ace Attorney variety, this is a pretty easy purchase overall.

After searching online, I found that some others had come across this bug (see: https://steamcommunity.com/app/384630/discussions/0/458607518210645753/) and that there was no fix besides maybe restarting the entire game and seeing if might be different the second time! \n\nAfter finally just accepting that loss and trying to move on (despite being constantly reminded by other characters that I'd lost a case that I never should have lost in the first place!), I found the game itself to be kind of ridiculous and flimsy plot-wise. The investigative phase is mostly just clicking a bunch of things and having the game figure out all the important stuff for you. The trials themselves made little sense logically and weren't all that engaging either. The thing that really bothered me was that you, as the defense attorney, were able to bring in evidence you found on your own at the crime scene, and absolutely no one would question the authenticity or admissability of this evidence!

Si nada de lo anterior despierta tu curiosidad, no s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 lo har\u00e1.\n\nEste juego es mejor de lo que tiene derecho a ser. Cualquiera de sus ingredientes, de forma aislada, puede resultar atractivo para alg\u00fan jugador; y la mezcla de todos ellos resulta novedosa, sin importar el motivo que te atrajo a \u00e9l.\n\nCon todas estas premisas no esperaba que la trama valiera para nada, pero supera mis expectativas (sin ser tampoco la repera). Tiene diferentes finales dependiendo de lo que hagas en el tercer cap\u00edtulo. Ninguno te cambiar\u00e1 la vida, pero si te est\u00e1 gustando el juego merece la pena exporarlos todos.\n\nEn ocasiones, la mec\u00e1nica de los interrogatorios es un poco obtusa: t\u00fa sabes las pruebas que has reunido y qu\u00e9 quieres alegar, pero no sabes c\u00f3mo espera el juego que las presentes. Vas haciendo prueba y error a ver c\u00f3mo sacas una prueba concreta, y algunas de ellas solo las puedes presentar porque m\u00e1gicamente llega un personaje en medio del juicio y por fin puedes mencionar la prueba que quer\u00edas mencionar. No s\u00e9 en los Ace Attorney pasa lo mismo.\n\nSi no controlas bien el ingl\u00e9s no le vas a sacar tanto jugo como podr\u00edas, ni a la trama ni al humor. Puede que hasta te cueste jugarlo.

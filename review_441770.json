I'm sure some of the really high-end softwares are worth it but if you don't want to take that risk or you just can't afford it, I have very little to complain about here.\n\nIt fixes seams with reasonable efficiency, has loads of colour options for each map, allows you to paste images from the clipboard, supports multiple images to blend at once, generates very good maps, is fast, offers many shape layers on height and normal maps, often knows what to do with lighting in a photograph, and is just overall good and cheap.\n\nMy complaints?  Two:  only square textures are supported, so I have to paste my non-tiling textures into Photoshop and 'square' them with a border before using them in this software; and when you blend maps with other images you have, you can't completely control the way it blends and you have to keep the original map as your 'main' map.

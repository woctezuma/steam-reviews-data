I will keep it short;\n\n1- The Art is different and refreshing from the Manga type of anime we normally see.  This style is more 'realistic'.  At first i wasn't sure i was going to appreciate it, but i did.   it gives the VN a sort of grounding and seriousness that make you quickly think this is not 'just' a game.\n\n2- I quickly became attached to all the caracters in the story.  Although they sometimes feel shallow, it is normally in order to make the story logical depending on your choices you makes.  So i did accept this and i was fine with it as the story unfold.\n\n3- The greatness in a story is when it keep your interrest all the way.  This novel did.  I mostly enjoyed every conversation (9/10) between the protagonist and the other caracters.\n\n4- The descriptions of love scene are very well done and the CGs that goes with them 'fix' the moment very well.  I loved the art of this.  I felt the scene and that is a sign of great writing.  Don't expect them to be 3x though, since that part is left to your imagination.\n\n5- Personaly i found the music to be totally nice and adequate to support what was happening.\n\n6- Sound effect could have been more present but what is here is good quality and again support very well the action that is happening.\n\n7- It is not a very long story, i have a 7 hours first pass at it.  Perfect for a rainy day or cold day.\n\n8- Like when you get out of a good movie, i wish i could have see more.  That is a sign of a good VN.\n\nAll in All;\n\nI GIVE A 8/10  for a 15$ purchase\nif you can get it for less than 10$, this is one not to miss!!!  ;)", "timestamp_created": 1515041421, "timestamp_updated": 1515041421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38924923": {"recommendationid": "38924923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198362356636", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515274435}, "language": "english", "review": "I first saw this VN on YouTube and watched two of the endings play out on there (Lyria's and Scherza's). Normally I'd be satisfied with that and move on to the next thing I wanted to watch or play, but not this time. Starlight Vega captured my attention first with its art style. It's got a looser artistic style than most other VNs I've read. At first I wasn't sure if that'd leave me with a negative opinion of the visuals, but it didn't. If anything, I think it really added to the VN in some way I can't quite put my finger on -- perhaps by adding a certain level of charm and grace -- but it fits. The harem endign CG doesn't save due to a glitch of some sort, so if you want that on hand then be sure to either screenshot it or make a save right before/during the scene with that CG. On the topic of the CGs, they're all beautiful. There is one in Scherza's route that looks unfinished as it doesn't have the same level of shading as any other scene does (CG or not), but it's still well done.\n\nThe soundtrack is great and hasn't ever felt like it wasn't in sync with the moment. It's got a more of a classic and acoustic sound to it overall than being heavy on electronics, which works especially well with the story being told. During more intense moments of action there's a more electronic beat which, while it works in the moment, overal sounds a little out of place with the rest of the soundtrack. Yet since it fits with the moments it plays during it can be shrugged off in spite of being a noticeable change. Even the main title screen music is great and catchy. I do wish there had been a track similar to it used somewhere in the story itself, but what's there already is already lovely.\n\nSpeaking of, the story is fantastic. Sure, it can be boiled down to girl finds strange book, meets demons, goes to their world, but what really brings the story to life are the characters themselves each with their own unique personality. Depending on the ending you go for, some characters get less screen time than others, but that's to be expected. It's definitely worth going through the VN multiple times for different endings to really get a feel for what each character is like. Of the characters, Scherza's won me over the most. The one thing that struck me as a little odd was the portrait for Aria's mother as she's always looking away, off into the distance, rather than at Aria/the player, so it felt a little strange to see her on screen. She's doesn't show up too much though so it's an oddity that can be overlooked.\n\nThe writing is straight forward, nothing overly eloquent sounding -- nothing superfluous -- plain, you could say, but not without finese. It's not uncommon for me to sometimes start skimming while reading VNs, but not with this one. Starlight Vega held my attention from beginning to end without my interest dwindling even after the first playthrough of it.\n\nThe soundtrack, characters, and the choices you make where each causes a clear impact and change on the story's direction, all come together to tell a beautifully written story with loveable characters, and strong soundtrack to accompany it and further set the mood of the scenes.\n\nI'd absolutely recommend this VN, it's one of my favorites. If you aren't certain about whether you want to get Starlight Vega or not, wait until it's on sale. It's worth the money either way and since it has seven outcomes, and with the achievements scattered between the majority of the routes, there's absolutely replay value for the completionists and even for those who want to see how the different routes pan out as the changes are significant between each route taken. It's also worthwhile to play through at least every individual character's good ending to get the full depth of the story as well. The harem ending is more for the fun of it being a harem conclusion.\n\nIf you're feeling unsure about getting Starlight Vega at full price then wait until it's on sale as it may feel like you don't have to expect quite as much if you get it then than at full price (though the VN is still very much worth full price to me as well). I will state that I got Starlight Vega on sale, but I wouldn't mind spending the full amount on it since I know I'm going to go back and read it again even though I've gone through the endings already.", "timestamp_created": 1514784088, "timestamp_updated": 1515205869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38884519": {"recommendationid": "38884519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103432976", "num_games_owned": 258, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511250195}, "language": "english", "review": "A charmingly engaging story, oddly.

While it doesn\u2019t do anything especially original, it tells an enjoyable story, with fairly serious and tasteful approach to relationship arcs and rather timid, but well thought-out eroticism. While it has love scenes, it\u2019s presenting them with literary descriptions rather than explicit artwork (illustration stops at partial nudity) \u2013 the approach I very much appreciated.\n\nThe artwork in general and music, while somewhat simple, complement the story very well and some situational illustrations were a joy to look at, even though they weren\u2019t super-heavy on details. The \u201cindie\u201d feel is very much present through the whole experience, but never gets in the way, even if sometimes I had a feeling that the writing could be better if a larger team worked on it. I think I\u2019ve also seen rare misspellings and strange grammar. It wasn\u2019t a major complain though and the story itself was very much gratifying \u2013 while short, it didn\u2019t lack amusing dialogues, good character development and rewarded multiple playthroughs, uncovering new lore, showing the major story points from new angles depending on the player choices and offered a bunch of distinct endings.\n\nOne thing that made me wonder is the portrayal of yuri romance itself \u2013 while I think that the writing for the main character seemed solid and believable in most ways, her (and other female character\u2019s) sexual attraction towards women is never explicitly mentioned/elaborated upon. As Aria is a high-schooler, she\u2019s either atypically certain about her orientation or the writers just didn\u2019t think to add that angle to the story \u2013 and I think it would benefit from it quite a lot. She seems uncertain about her feeling and don\u2019t properly read her best friend Melody\u2019s intentions, but the way it was presented in the story makes her feel just dense, rather than properly confused by her unusual feelings. Other than that I find all the characters rather interesting and having decent depth for such a short story (although it shows mostly if you follow their separate romance routes).\n\n[b]In general, I\u2019ve found this game very enjoyable and I can recommend it to anyone liking VNs or just looking for a nice romance story to read.

I was impressed by the quality and will say that it was well worth the price.\n\nThe art is great. The characters are well designed and have satisfyingly expressive sprites, and the CG's are of great quality.\n\nI enjoyed the story, or pehaps I should say stories. My choices always felt like they mattered, which is obviously a big plus for any game with multiple story paths. The routes all felt like they were developed equally, rather than there being some routes written significantly better than any others. The good endings all came to satisfactory conclusions, and resolved their problems differently, rather than having one main story path with \"detours\" depending on your choices.\n\nThe romance was tasteful (perhaps aside from one particular ending) and well executed, each girl felt different but all were pleasant.\n\nI can heartily recommend Starlight Vega to anyone at all. It's a great starting point for those new to visual novels (or new to yuri), as well as a great visual novel for veterans who just want a fun read.\n\nNote: There is partial nudity in the game, in the few scenes of... romantic stuff.

[i]Starlight Vega[/i]\u2019s plot, while not spectacular, could have made for a decent story if the characters\u2019 writing had been strong. It isn\u2019t. Everything in this visual novel feels flat, and falls flat. \n\nThis is especially disappointing as Aria at first looks like a strong-willed protagonist, but in reality over half of her lines are just bland descriptions of her surroundings and of the people next to her, without any personal input that could give the reader some hints about her character and the way [b]she[/b] sees her new world (as she has just moved in a new house, where all the supernatural events unfold).\n\nThe game attempts to touch at political intrigue, but its obvious main appeal is romance, and if I were to find three phrases to describe it, it would be tedious, unconvincing and full of bad fanservice. The first two go hand in hand. The characters do not spend enough time together or don\u2019t have any significant bonding moments/common traits that would justify the sudden feelings Aria has for her love interest (or is \u2018she\u2019s good-looking\u2019 alone supposed to be convincing ?) And when they eventually kiss and declare their love for each other, the writing makes it feel so unrelatable I just couldn\u2019t rejoice, empathise with the characters, find them cute or any other positive feeling. I would make an exception for Melody\u2019s route, which was the better of the three and felt more solid to read, but unfortunately it still couldn\u2019t shake off the boredom the game had brought about in me at this point.\n\nFanservice is my main problem with the game, though. If it just consisted of a few raunchy CGs, it\u2019d be fine. The issue is, this game (and especially Lydia\u2019s route, which I had the misfortune to play first) makes its plot unfold thanks to a certain amount of gross tropes you would traditionally see in some bad fanfiction, and not a game you have to actually pay for. Namely, Lydia can\u2019t seem to stop herself from sexually assaulting the main character (who eventually returns her feelings despite this, [i]obviously[/i]), even after the latter makes it clear to her she isn\u2019t interested in her advances (there is even an achievement for this scene, what the hell). I know it\u2019s supposed to be sexy and to make the player want to pursue a romance with her, but I found it off-putting and it made me feel really uncomfortable, especially considering the fact it happens several times. The so-called harem ending is also terrible in that aspect, as it is out-of-character for at least half of the characters involved and a cheap excuse to show us a CG that doesn\u2019t even appear in the gallery by the end.\n\nThe art is decent and probably the best aspect of the game, but it lacks polish and one cannot overlook the fact that the same backgrounds are repeatedly used for different locations and the sprites lack diversity. The music is forgettable.\n\nTl;dr: I\u2019m saddened to be writing this kind of review for a f/f dating sim, as there are not so many of them, but [i]Starlight Vega[/i] being at best tedious to read and at worst trying to justify romance with creepy tropes and cheap feelings, I just can\u2019t recommend it, especially if you\u2019re LGBT+ and looking for good representation.

In between lay the most enjoyable gaming experience I had this year.\n\nEspecially compelling was the heartwarming combination of artwork and character design. Aria is a believable main character, whose rational distance to her own emotions and devotion to her friends make her really likeable. Her facial expressions were charming and fitting throughout the whole story. All the love interests played well together and I enjoyed the route of every single one of them. Their traits, design, interaction and the fantastical story made me truly care for them and I was happy, when the story proceeded happily and sad, when I got bad endings. The CGs are wonderful. This altogether created an affection of the higher kind for me, because I didn\u2019t just feel for the characters in the game, but also felt the satisfaction of experiencing a subtle hint of the author\u2019s own joy in creating them so diligently.\n\nMusic was pretty good too. The title theme was catchy and I found myself browsing through the CG sets to enjoy the tune some more. Rest of the music was also fitting despite being less memorable.\nI also liked the right amount of sensitivity in the intimate scenes as well as the use of language for those and the story as a whole. A lot of thought was put in the narration, which made the novel a comfortable read.\n\nI won\u2019t deny that there are still some flaws. The male characters were in no way as charming as their female counterparts. The backgrounds were sometimes inappropriately repetitive. There are holes in the plot or at least some parts were not as well played out as they could have been [spoiler]the whole curse for example[/spoiler]. Some choices seem rather irrational, too (and my last achievement and the best CG are still locked -.-). But who cares, right? (maybe all the people who aren\u2019t into demon yuri visual novels with choices\u2026[strike]and those who can\u2019t appreciate good games xp[/strike]\n\nokay without personal bias I would still highly recommend this game, if you are open minded to Indie VN and Yuri, although maybe the flaws hit a bit harder here. And if for reasons unbeknownst to me you cannot connect with the characters, then maybe the art is all that\u2019s left for you.\n\nBut with personal bias this game was just my cup of tea. \n10/10\n\nWell done and thank you, Razzart!\n\nPS: Harem rules!\n", "timestamp_created": 1480384451, "timestamp_updated": 1480384451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511756", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27997784": {"recommendationid": "27997784", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057183926", "num_games_owned": 769, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460915568}, "language": "english", "review": "I backed this game on Kickstarter and I love it.

Play this.\nDo you like a plot that comes from conflict within the characters' desires? Play this.\n\nThe only thing I find not perfectly to my personal preferences is that I wish the protag was a bit more gung ho about being in a yuri story from the start... but she does grow into it very well.\n\nI personally really loved the music. It's a bit repetetive and seemed to turn off randomly if I left a scene up for too long, but this never felt super unwelcome. The sexy music is sexy. The sad music is sad.

I backed it on Kickstarter not knowing what to expect, so when I finally got around to starting it a few days ago, I was delighted to find that it exceeded my expectations.  Starlight Vega is a lovely fantasy romance story with immediately likable (if somewhat arch) characters, a compelling and well-paced plot, an art style that strikes a nice balance between the standard anime style of many VNs and a sketchier \"Western\" style, and an appealing heroine who doesn't belabor the point in a misguided quest for \"immersion\" like so many VN protagonists do.\n\nI really like that our humble narrator is visible in the corner of the screen and reacting to events with different expressions at almost all times, which gives us visual shorthand as to how she's feeling at any given moment.  That's a really smart piece of design other VNs would do well to steal.\n\nMy only complaints are all fairly slight and understandable given the budget, but they remain complaints nonetheless.

As far as visual novels go, it isn't too bad.  The soundtrack is mostly forgettable.  The best thing about this visual novel was the art, I think. \n\nLet's start with the basics; character and plot.  The characters, as most characters go, are fairly cliche; that's nothing too bad, though.  It's really difficult to come up with original characters nowadays; what matters more is what you do with them.  The protagonist caught my interest; while nothing innovative, she is a solid and relatable female lead, somewhat intelligent and quirky enough to keep my interest. \n\nThe supporting cast is much of the same; all are somewhat interesting.  \n\nBut one of the biggest problems of this VN are revealed; every single character is shallow.  None of the characters have much background at all, only that which is immediately relevant to the plot.  While that isn't normally a bad thing, this ties in to a major failing of the plot, but we'll get to that later.\n\nSo the characters aren't anything special.  I won't remember this VN in a week.  There isn't anything particularly memorable about this.\n\nMoving on to the plot and general play.  Don't be fooled by my time; this VN only has about 6 hours of playthrough; I spent the other six AFK.  There's really not much playability in this despite there being four different routes and about eight different endings.  At $15 USD, that's a fairly hefty price as far as games go.  There are quite a few few VNs out there with much more playability, so expect to eat through this fairly quickly.  \n\nThe routes and options don't always make sense.  The [spoiler]secret harem[/spoiler] route, for example, is out of character for at least two of the characters.  And while we're talking about love and plot, well, we should note that there are so few interactions between characters, relatively, that it's hard to believe that enough time has passed for the protagonist to love any of the characters.  The only one that makes sense is the Melody route, since they've been friends for a while, but the protagonist's thoughts on love are done awkwardly.  The fact that there isn't really a sense of time to the story when they [spoiler]go to Vega[/spoiler] doesn't help. \n\nThere's extremely limited backstory to the game; only what matters to the plot is talked about, and that creates a sense of shallowness and disconnect that makes it hard to really feel.  Outside of the story, the characters really are relatively normal...and while that helps us relate a little, it also means that we aren't really emotionally invested in them.  \n\nMuch of the [spoiler]Vega[/spoiler] portion of the game, I think, could've been written better, especially in regards to [spoiler]the curse.[/spoiler]  Everything happens in a relaxed manner despite the urgency of the situation and what could have easily been an emotionally deep tale just feels boring and mundane.  \n\nThe climax of the story is atrociously dull; the only route that intrigued me was, again, Melody's route, because there was a little bit, and JUST a little bit, of emotional suspense.  The story itself already indicated that all of the characters had [spoiler]plot armor[/spoiler] so that wasn't too good, either. \n\nThe bad routes just felt off, too.  One of the choices that makes sense actually leads you to the bad route, which was weird and disappointing.  A lot of the farewell scenes were rather unrealistic, and only [spoiler]the Melody Bad End Route[/spoiler] was actually particularly bad; everything else was neutral.  \n\nThere's this entire world out there, and it's barely, barely explored; only the plot-relevant details are mentioned, and some fluff within the routes.  That was disappointing.\n\nThe music is nice, but not special.  The sound effects were good, though.  \n\nThe art was definitely the saving grace of this piece.  The CGs and sprites are gorgeous.  Enough said.\n\nThe smut is...intriguing.  Only [spoiler]Melody's route, again[/spoiler] actually went into it in any detail; every other route cuts off.  What's there is pretty nice to read.  \n\nAll in all, this visual novel isn't bad.  What exists is enough to interest.  The single failing of this piece is that there is a lot of potential to create an emotionally thrilling VN...and that potential is only scratched at in this story.\n\nIt's not special, and, as a result, simply isn't worth $15 dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1466770323, "timestamp_updated": 1466770323, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23720618": {"recommendationid": "23720618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030296971", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463774656}, "language": "english", "review": "This game gets extra points just for having a harem route tbh\n8/10 would play video games with a demon", "timestamp_created": 1466662073, "timestamp_updated": 1466662073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23701396": {"recommendationid": "23701396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118429454", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466583513}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are a lesbian, or really like girls while being a girl, have a thing for demons, fantasy, magic, and like reading.\n\nYou should get this game.\n\nAlso there's a bonus unlockable ending that is totally worth it.\n\nMy only hope is they fix the 1 bug that people have found.

While exploring the upstairs study one night, she and her friend Melody accidentally unleash a flirtatious demon named Lyria, who spent the past fifty years in a stone. After freeing her from her prison, the two become attached by a \u2018lifestone\u2019, which means Lyria can\u2019t go far from Aria without feeling repercussions, and vice versa. Now Aria, an ordinary highschool girl, must find a way to free herself from Lyria, who seems to crave the exact opposite. Add to that the increasingly realistic dreams plaguing Aria, the sexual tension between Aria and a select few girls around her, and the supernatural phenomena \u2013 it seems like Aria\u2019s life will never be the same again.\n\nThe story overall is interesting but I was not captivated by it and it has failed to immerse me into the story because the individual routes each has their weak points in terms of there were some important points that were not explored on that individual route, for example 1 of the routes did not explain or even hinted of how Lyria got trapped in the stone. I am not sure which route is that. Apparently among all the character routes I liked the harem ending the most it felt more interesting than the other \u201cgood routes\u201d as it touches on almost every topic and the characters in harem ending has more \u201cbackbone\u201dthey all group together and fought \u201cReid\u201d.\n\nCharacter wise I like Scherza: Current Queen of the demon realm. She has a very icy personality and little like for humans. The pacing her route is alright it is not to fast or slow. The main reason I liked her from the start is provably because of her looks and character design she fits into the character personality perfectly, she looks so intimidating and \u201croyal like\u201d.\n\n[h1]Audio and Visual elements[/h1]\n[b]Visual Elements \u2013[/b]The visual elements is provably the most distinctive feature in the particular visual novel [well for me] I absolutely adore the artwork and art style being used in this visual novel and it is very consistent with character sprites,  not to mention the backgrounds are very beautiful as it compliments nicely with the overall art style.\n\n[b]Audio Elements \u2013[/b] The music sets the mood for every situation, but it is not memorable and did not leave an impact on me. I think they could have done better for the music because I felt that certain soundtracks was repeated too many times and some were just plain boring.\n\n[h1]To Sum Up [/h1]\nTo sum up do I recommend this visual novel? Simple answer, yes. People who likes yuri will definitely enjoy Starlight Vega as it is very heavily yuri themed and the romance does not feel forced. Something else worth mentioning is that for the yuri scenes they are all very descriptive and detailed, overall an enjoyable read from the start to finish.\n\n[i]I have been provided a review copy for Starlight Vega but it has no impact on this review in any way.[/i]\n\n[url=https://azusantiara.com/2016/04/23/starlight-vega-review/]Click here for a review with images etc[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1461345557, "timestamp_updated": 1461345588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.753181", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22555827": {"recommendationid": "22555827", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993857397", "num_games_owned": 670, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461694583}, "language": "english", "review": "A good story with nice music.

Yes, it's worth the full price of $15 USD. Just buy it.\n\n\nStarlight Vega is a fairly light hearted love comedy with LOTS of yuri in it. Just subtext? No! This is 100% bona fide yuri with love confessions, kissing, and PG-13 love scenes. (I would still not play this in front of your parents.) Art-wise, it's adequate enough. It's not bad, just adequate. Soundtrack is enough to set the mood. A single run through can easily be done under 7 hours depending on how fast you read. A complete run with old scene skipping took me 12 hours for all endings. Now for the nitpickings.\n\n[u][b]There MAY be some slight spoilers. Read the next paragraph at your own discretion.[/b][/u]\n\n\n\n\n\nPLOT\n\n[u]Almost 4th ending exclusive:[/u]\n\nThere are definitely moments of [i]\"it's magic I ain't gotta explain shit\"[/i] going on. Sometimes there are story transitions where it may feel a tad forced. This becomes pretty apparent in the unlocked ending with the way the antagonist is disposed of. Wait a gosh darn minute, we had such a pain in the rear time dealing with this twerp in every other route and all of a sudden it's [spoiler]Persona style All Out Attack on the jerk. All of a sudden everyone but the MC just figured out the quickest way to get rid of curse was to beat the living undead shit out of a malevolent spirit. What da hell?[/spoiler] You girls just reconcile out of the blue ridiculously quickly. For one thing, Scherza's [spoiler]abandonment issue[/spoiler] was only really addressed in Lyria's route where she finally learned [spoiler]what really happened 50 years ago.[/spoiler] Even in Scherza's route, she's one heck of an ice queen to woo. The only times Aria really ever interact with Scherza one on one was [spoiler]in a dream when they haven't been kidnapped to Vega.[/spoiler] There have been instances where she does talk with Aria in a more private fashion, but nothing as deep as whatever happened in Scherza's own route enough for Scherza to get romantically interested in Aria...? To sum it up, the 4th ending just seems to parachute in from out of nowhere. There ARE attempts at trying to make this work, but the progress at how we arrived at this point just seems loosely held together by... [spoiler]harem[/spoiler] anime logic. Yes, Kickstarter incentive and etc. I really enjoyed it but it could've done with more polishing.\n\n[u]Choices[/u]\n\nYes, there are choices. Choices that easily dictate which route you are going to end up on and some do seemingly absolutely nothing. For all the choices, I wish at there are things I can do more of. Ok, the bracelet in the study. It was briefly brought up and [i]never[/i] heard from again. Could've been funny if that was somehow used. The whole thing between Lyria and Scherza was unfortunately only properly addressed in Lyria's route. Aria has no say whatsoever regarding what actually transpired even though she may have come across the diary and whatever Lyria told her. She has 0 influence whatsoever as a main character and I find that very unfortunate as I do want the two of them to get along. \n\n[u]Characters[/u]\n\nI adore the characters: Aria, Melody, Lyria, Scherza, and Rhihannon. I'm tempted to say Aria has some issues as a MC, but I've seen much worse performance from otome games so I guess she got [i]just[/i] enough done. I feel for Melody, a lot. She really got the shaft in not her endings. Such a good trooper and super friend. Lyria is just Lyria, fairly straight forward. Scherza is a slight mixed bag due to her behaviors in her own route and whatever happened in the 4th ending. The antagonist is... weeeeeaaaaak. Not enough build up.[i] OOoooh, sinister silhouette. That should totally be enough to give it away.[/i] Not quite. I want to dig in into whatever happened back then. It's all just he says vs she says. Seriously, was it really as bad as it was thought or was there enough room for different interpretations? Scherza does paint the situation different than what was described by everyone else. More plot points please.\n\n\n\nThe story definitely had a few hiccup points, but overall it holds together well enough for me to gloss over the minor pitfalls it have. Would I recommend this to anyone interested in yuri game? Absolutely. I would try to sell this to anyone who's open to a light hearted visual novel. I got great milage out of it.\n\n\n\n\nMore nitpicks\nI need more save slots though. There just isn't enough for every choice in every route. \nPlease check your grammar and spelling again. There are definitely a few mistakes. I think there is also some coding issue in the special thanks section where someone' name shows up as 4 rectangles... I get there are a LOT of people who donated in the Kickstarter, but that's quite the speed at which you are scrolling...\nNot everyone plays visual novel on a daily basis.

She just moved in to her grandfather's old house along with her mother. Her best friend Melody accompanies her for the night. There they come across a demon, who was trapped in a jewel, named Lyria and an old spell book belonging to her grandfather. They discover that there is a whole other world named Vega, were demons and magic is common place. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't say anymore about the story. \n\nThis is a GxG game. Aria gets to romance Lyria, the sultry demon, Melody, her best friend, and Scherza, a mysterious woman she meets in her dreams. After you complete the game you get the harem route where you can go out with all three of them.\n\nIt took me around 6 hours to get through (I skipped read text). So it's not that long.\n\nThe overall story is interesting. It has its surprises and you do want to know what is going to happen next but I did feel like the resolution for the problem in Vega was resolved in a very anti-climatic way. Like it just gets solved so easy. I was like, \u201cthat's it?\u201d. I also felt like some routes just kinda ended. Also, some of the stuff that happens with Aria's grandparents could have been a bit more in depth. I just wanted to know more about them and what exactly happened in the past that lead to the current events, but that's just my personal opinion. Game does give enough info to get the gist of it.\n\nThe actual character routes that dealt with the romance were well done. There's some conflict between the characters that makes things more interesting. In each route you learn something new about the overall plot and everything is revealed little by little as you play all three routes. The harem route seems more like an extra.\n\nTo get each character route you are given choices. Some lead to bad endings but it's not that difficult to figure out what you did wrong. I was able to get through this game and get all the achievements without a guide. Just save when there is an important choice.\n\nMy favorite character was Scherza, I just like those types of cold characters that warm up as the story goes. At first, I didn't like Lyria much but as I played other routes I also ended up liking her too. I liked Melody too and some parts in her route made me feel bad for her. Aria takes a while to realize things. I liked all the characters, even Sid (who seemed annoying at first but I really liked that little guy as I got to know him better).\n\nThe CGs are all well drawn except for one that seemed unfinished like they forgot to finish coloring it or something. It's not big deal but it did bother me a bit. The sprites do look different from the CGs but they are fine, well except that Lyria looks older than in her CGs. There are adult scenes but nothing explicit there is an age verification for reason for this page though. As for the backgrounds, some are more detailed than others. \n\nI did spot some spelling errors but nothing that heavly distracts from the overall reading experience.\n\nOverall, it's a great game and I recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1460858089, "timestamp_updated": 1460858089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22465598": {"recommendationid": "22465598", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963728651", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460933674}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great.

It allows you to make some choices here and there that guide you towards a particular ending, but otherwise you'll be spending your time reading--which is fine, because the story is engaging and complex.  [/h1]\n\n.Story.\nIt's so difficult to comment on this without spoiling anything, so I'll just say that it's cute and fluffy at times, raunchy and suggestive at others. There's political intrigue, humour, fantasy/magical elements, supernatural elements like ghosts and other realms, combat, romance, non-explicit limes... The list goes on. I imagine there's something here for everyone, especially if you're a fan of reading. \n\nThere were only a few typos, which I greatly appreciated. Thank you for your level of polish, Starlight Vega, you beautiful beast. There are also a couple of plot holes (and one big enough to fall into), but I was so focused on the *adorable* romance that I didn't really mind all that much.\n\n.Game play.\nWhat are you, new here? This is a visual novel. Click your mouse and read the text that appears. \n\nYou can save and load at any point, barring when you're in the middle of making a decision, simply by pressing the right mouse button, which is handy. There's also a gallery for all of the CG you unlike by triggering events in the story or as part of the normal playthrough. \n\nYou can play in full screen or windowed, though I preferred the latter because full screen gives you black bars on the sides.\n\n.Soundtrack.\nThere was never a moment where I felt as though the music didn't suit what was going on in-game. Romantic scenes featured softer, slower tracks and fight scenes featured upbeat electronic scores. The background music kept me immersed in the story, never drawing away from what was happening, but also making what I read that much more memorable because it was so well-suited. \n\nHell, I went to the store while playing to see if the store had the option to purchase the soundtrack separately.\n\n-A minor gripe is that some of the sound effects used for things like gusts of wind and magical attacks sound a little hokey.\n\n.Art style.\nThe game looks great. Kudos to whoever handled the art.  It's all done in a brightly-coloured anime style, and the backgrounds share the same feel. \n\nThe main character's portrait, which is almost always presented in the bottom left corner of the screen, changes expression depending on what's being said. It's a nice touch and very well detailed. The other characters have a host of different positions and facial expressions that are cycled through, which is another nice touch to make them seem more than just some beautifully-rendered image.\n\n-The backgrounds were pretty limited and, though the game takes place in a variety of settings, you only ever see the same series of images; i.e, the bits where you're at school utilize the same image of the woods that you see when you're at home. Again, this is minor. The backgrounds were still nice to look at, it was just a matter of taking a moment to ground myself in what setting the action had moved to.\n\n.Characters.\n\nThere are eight main ones who get detailed portraits. Everone else is just a name on the screen. The cast is varied without fulfilling too many over-used tropes like the emo pretty boy or the girl who wants his attention. Not a single character was annoying, which I find tends to happen a lot with this kind of game. That's a major plus.\n\nCharacters include demons, humans, and a wyvern. His name is Sid. He's adorable.\n\nAgain, not much to be said here without spoiling anything.\n\n.Bottom line.\nIf you're in the market for a visual novel, this is definitely worth your money. The game looks good, it's well-written, and you'll get multiple playthroughs out of it. I adore this game. It's one of the better visual novels I've played on Steam; I'm only stopping here because it's very late at night. \n\nNeedless to say, I'm hooked. I whole-heartedly give this game my recommendation.\n\n\n[code]If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs-up.

I played it all day long and it was a nice break from life XD. Though there are some things that might be a bit off, Starlight Vega is a very enjoyable visual novel. Now onto the review \n\nStory \nI find the story to have some very strong points but also some weak ones. The story overall is very interesting from the book, to how Lyria became trapped in stone, and the curse plaguing Vega. My problem though (and this depends on the route) is that thehe story can be weak at times. I think the story stayed pretty strong in Lyria's route. Not only do you find out who Aria's grandpa is, but you also get to know how Lyria came to be in the stone. Same goes for Melody's route to. Where it falls weak though is when we get to the curse and the book itself at times. I sometimes felt like the curse put on Vega wasn't shown enough and wished to feel more of that dread. I admit in Scherza's route that the curse is a bit better played out, but it kind of ends just like that. Still the story was written well and I will give major kudos to how the creator handle the intimate scenes. \n\nCharacters \n\nOne of the best parts of the game and they are what hold the story together. I'll give my thoughts on all of the main five. \n\nAria- Our main character. She is an average yet interesting girl who is put into a tough situation. I'll say Aria is pretty likable. She has a personality and tries her best to deal with all these new things thrown at her. I admit sometimes I kind of wish she had more of a spark, but for what we got I did enjoy her and she made the romance feel true with the girls. \n\nLyria- I think the best girl. From the moment I saw her I really did enjoy her personality and flirtatious, yet sometimes forceful attitude. Her route I believe was the strongest and I felt Aria and she were the best match. What I liked most about her route was the pacing with the romance. It felt very genuine and the pair had good chemistry. Also her story felt the most complete and I kind of wish the bad guy was in all of the routes since it made more sense. If I had to pick something I didn't like....well I can't think of it XD. Lyria was really a good and well thought out character. My fav to. \n\nMelody- Aria's best friend. From the moment I saw this girl's design I knew what she'd be like and I was right. Now don't get me wrong, Melody is a good character and the type of friend I'd want. I admit though she was the most boring of the three, but don't get me wrong, I still liked her character. Her love and care for Aria was really sweet and though I found her route to be the less interesting of the three, I did care for her. Only thing is I think she'd be better as a friend to Aria, but that's just me. Her route was cute though and she really has some beautiful CG's\n\nScherza-I'll admit, I was a bit surprised by this character. I knew she'd be the cold demon and some may find her not too likable. However Scherza, especially in her own route, shows a great deal of sadness and loneliness through the story due to the events in the past. What surprised me even more was she wasn't a Tsun type character despite being cold. In fact I really felt for the girl in all the routes. Her relationship with Aria was done pretty well to and that last CG in her route is pretty amazing. I did feel like Scherza was the second best matched for Aria to. Some points I didn't like about her route was how sometimes it felt rushed. Though the curse is touched upon more and you do feel sorry for Vega, I wished that it was a bit longer to show more of the problem Vega was facing But the creator did do a good job with pacing in her route, so it's not that big of a problem \n\nSid- At first I hated this little guy, but he does grow on you. I can't say much without spoiling anything, but I'll tell you that you will feel sorry for him as you read. \n\nArt\n\nArt is Starlight Vega is very good. I love how the sprites have  unique style. I admit I wish they had some more outfit variations. It was odd to go from sprites and then to CGs where the girls are wearing something entirely different. Still the sprites are very well done. \n\nCGs are exceptional. Every single one was done very well and I'll tell you I'll be looking back at them XD. If you can save them do, because Razz did an awesome job. \n\n\nBackgrounds are pretty good to. I admit some are better then others, but I never got put off by any. I think the demon castle had some of the best backgrounds. I do think that the castle bed rooms needed just small variations as well, but that's a minor thing. \n\nMusic \n\nMusic is good. Some songs may be a bit off putting, but overall the track was nice hearing. I never turned it off.\n\nClosing Notes \n\nStarlight Vega is a very good and  fun visual novel. It's the first one I've played straight through in a while. The characters, art and story are overall great and I thank the creator for doing a GxG visual novel that can be enjoyed by all people and not just a certain group. Another thing I appreciate is how she handled the intimate scenes. They are done very well and I feel like if she did a more adult game she'd handle them well. \n\nAnyway if you're looking for a fun, pure GxG, romance story this is it. The price is far and I think you'll have a good time reading it I know I did =). \n\nRating-8/10", "timestamp_created": 1460699893, "timestamp_updated": 1460699893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.828847", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22421532": {"recommendationid": "22421532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133857538", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 493, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485244871}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game!

You play as Aria, a young woman who moves into her grandfather\u2019s old house. She doesn\u2019t know much about him, but she never could have guessed that the gem he was hiding in his study held a demon inside! That gem becomes fused with Aria\u2019s body, binding her to Lyria, the demon. Aria, her best friend Melody, and Lyria have to work to find a way to remove the gem - and then get Lyria home.\n\nThis is a finely made VN - the sprites are appealing, the CGs are plush and well done, the writing is fun and bouncy and lively. Aria has three romance options - Melody, Lyria, and Lyria\u2019s sister, Scherza - that are all different and all well done. The love scenes - which you can choose to turn on or off from the settings menu - are spicy without being ultra-explicit, and they\u2019re tender and sweet and loving which is all that I give a shit about.", "timestamp_created": 1516474925, "timestamp_updated": 1516474925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 126, "total_negative": 8, "total_reviews": 134}}

However its all humours and funny to read. It is open world. So you do fetch quests for the villagers. The first town teaches you about the game and once your read to leave you can pick a partner to buddy up with. I picked a women who is like Annie Oakly. Their is also a female doctor and a crazy drunk. Their are also 3 classes to choose from. I picked cow puncher. Cows are evil in this game. \n\nThe battles are turn based. The battles are interesting and surprisingly their are sometimes a few different ways to avoid combat and not have to kill anyone. I enjoyed the combat its interesting. The download for the game was 150mb. So its a fast download. However it expands to gigs on your hard drive.

In the 20 hours it took me to solve it the first time, I pretty much did nothing else until I had finished it, despite the fact that I was supposed to be studying.\n\nThe game is set in absurd western themed world where humour is so baked into the fabric of everything that there is virtually nothing that isn't some kind of joke.  This could easily fall flat if it were poorly written, but I found the writing to be fantastic.  Obviouslly humour is subjective so if you aren't onboard with it's humour you proably won't get much out of it.  For everyone else you are due for a hell of a ride as the game is an absolute hoot.\n\nThe game takes place in a kind of openinsh world with your character setting out from a location on their horse. You can either select to \"Wander\" in which case you will make a broad loop out and around, potentially unovering new map locations or encountering a random encounter.  You can also direct travel to locations you have found and will also be told about map locations from NPC's or as the outcomes of various quests.    The world is feels quite expansive with a lot of interesting locations to explore.  There are a couple of central plot quests to pursue and a bunch of side quests as well.  In my 20 hour playthrough I managed to complete the main story but still had a few side things Id managed to miss all the clues for.\n\nCombat in the game takes place in a turn based format that should feel familiar to anyone has played a JRPG before.  You stand on one side, your foes tand on the other and you select your various attacks and abilities from a list specific to each characters class.  As you gain XP  you can choose what skills you buy so you can tailor your character to your play style, with higher skill levels costing increasing amounts of XP.  You can further personalise your character with a swathe of various equiment, almost all of which is humorous and absurd.  The combat is not particularly complex but its good enough and the humour is so good that it really does the heavy lifting for keeping you engaged.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots the graphics portray everything in stick figures, but everything is surpisingly detailed and the great animation and the little touches really add to the charm of world.  A still screenshot doesn't really do justice to how much fun this game is to see in motion.\n\nThe music and sound are suprisingly good too, with twangy guitars and banjos mixed with good old time whistling and other wild west sounding stuffness.

Or simplistic turn based rpg combat?\nGet this game.\n\nWest Of Loathing is just as described, its combat isnt too complicated to the point you'll feel the need to max yourself out to stand a chance against bosses, its pretty straight forward. You can explore the world at your own pace (with one or two expections for story),  a TON of side missions to you that are geniuely fun with little room for any that make you feel like your just doing it for stats.\n\nYou create your own character with their class, plot motive, and name, choose your own side kick & horse, and then you sit back and let things play out.\nOne of the west of loathings greatest aspects has to be the interactions with other characters. While your exploring the overworld you'll find yourselves in moments when you'll have a random encounter and the game kicks in its sense of humor. You'll know what choices you would do if you were playing a game like The Walking Dead, but you'll often just pick whichever choice that would make you smile because the game clearly knows its got some jokes to it, it'll wont punish you for doing just that. if you feel like letting a skeleton continue to read his book in peace, you can walk away. if you wanna talk to him, and continue to pester him, you can go on and on until he gets mad and fights you.\nthats not to say you'll read EVRYTHING. when exploring the overworld map you'll run into moments when its just the game helping you earn exp, or items. those moments become very quick to recognize and you'll just skip over text as it plays out like a common \"you encountered a bad guy. FIGHT!\", or \"You found a dusty satchle in the sand!\", until you get an actual choice. So its not like its a massive time waster.\n\nIf you want to grind and get some high stats so you can do some of the more ridiculous quests, there's places you can go. that were clearly made with the intention of players grinding in specific locations. However the game lacks any sort of auto fight mode (like earthbound or bravely defualt) to speed things up without you have to press anything other than the commands you want. Nor is there any type of battle speed to make animations shorter. its not something that'll be much of a problem, but having it would be nice for those who love going above and beyond. I wouldn't expect a game like this to really add these features, though again, those dedicated, it could save time in the long run. even if only a few seconds.\n\nFinal thoughts, is this game worth the purchase? Absoluetly. Even with the minor problems of paragraphs of text for overworld encounters, and the lack of some modern day RPG combat features, West of Loathing is a great time to be had.\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1512777478, "timestamp_updated": 1512777478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519796", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38165140": {"recommendationid": "38165140", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025784318", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511833313}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic not only writing, but compelling RPG", "timestamp_created": 1512775713, "timestamp_updated": 1512775713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38164729": {"recommendationid": "38164729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198364165748", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506854132}, "language": "english", "review": "Hilarious game.

When each one of those walk cycles has their own unique sounds associated with them, you KNOW you're in for a good game.\n\nWest of Loathing is a RPG from the people who made Kingdom of Loathing, and shares its artstyle, humor, and some gameplay mechanics. Yes, the artstyle is just stickfigures and black & white graphics, but it works, surprisingly. Everything's well animated and detailed, despite the simplicity, giving it a certain nice charm. The simplicity also helps for the UI, as there's very little clutter. This helps, because your inventory gets -really- cluttered (which is a good thing, stick with me).\n\nGameplay is the standard \"loot and talk to people\" out of combat then \"turn-based combat\" combat. Combat's simplistic, you and your ally take a turn, then your enemies. Combat's rather easy, not only because it's easy to just out-stat your enemies with the various food, booze, and potion buffs, but also because combat items don't cost an action, thus allowing you to use as many as you need to finish off enemies. There is a hard-mode, but I've yet to try it and see how combat's on it there.\nThe true meat of the game lies in the out of combat stuff. There is a lot of things out in the West, and thus, a lot of writing. Every item out of the hundreds of items has a small quip of description that's worth looking at, every location seems to be handcrafted with a purpose, and the dialogue is superb. Still, there is a -lot- of writing, as said. Between exploring eldritch horrors and necromantic power you shouldn't be tackling with, to a heartwarming relationship between a lass and man-cactus hybrid, it's all smart, well-written, and humorous. The sheer volume of writing can be a slight turn off if that's not what you're into, but if you've read this far into the review, chances are you'd be the audience this game is selling to.\n\nIt's also rather nice that there's very little filler in this game. I finished it in 7 hours, but I always felt like I was doing something in those seven hours. Not like Skyrim or Fallout 4's generic caves and dungeons, everything seems to have it's own unique story or twist, and chances are you'll bump into a quest or someone that will point you towards something new. \nNot only that, but there's plenty of good puzzling to be had as well (most of it optional, if you're not the type, however), legit puzzles that get you Googling and searching about. There's little grind as well, since there's plenty of just small flavor actions and text-encounters you have traveling about that grant you XP, though there are certain locations with infinite enemy spawners, in the off-chance you do want to grind. \n\nIt's also pretty decent to replay. The three different classes seem to play fairly differently, and there's a fair amount of different followers you can bring with you, each having different quips and dialogue, alongside the aforementioned hard mode. There may be no need to actually replay the game, however, simply due to the sheer density of content available.\n\nWhile West of Loathing doesn't do much new in terms of gameplay, it makes up for it far more with it's superb writing and charm. It avoids most of the pitfalls and downsides of most typical RPG games, with very little need to grind, and very little feeling of grinding.\n\nAnd only for 11 bucks?

You really are only playing this game for the humour, and it is funny, but not enough so to make it worth the money or time spent in tedious gameplay. \n\nThe battles are incredibly easy, and as you only have 1 or 2 characters, each with only a few moves, they are very repetative and boring. Within a few hours play you have a ready supply of items that can greatly boost your stats for an entire day, and moves that can kill literally any enemy in 1 or 2 turns. You also get all HP and AP restored at end of battle, so are ready to instantly win the next fight. There are so few actions ever available that you can't even try to make the battles entertaining with different tactics. When you rarely do lose a battle, rather than punishing in any way, it automatically boosts all your stats and lets you immediatly try again :S So rather than getting to retry the same battle using what you learned from the previous defeat the game just makes it easier. \n\nThere is apparently a helmet you can find in first town to make the game harder, but why make that a hidden item? Also it prevents you taking a partner along, so the battles which are already bare-bones, boring and repatative, would be even more so with only 1 character. \n\nCombat aside there is a basic point and clip adventrue element going on, but even that you are simply walked through. Never any real thought involved or choice, just a case of going somewhere, talking to someone or collecting something... any time an item in the inventory or some kind of interaction is required it is immediatly suggested. \n\nAll this game has going for it is some funny WIld West banter and a quirky style, which soon gets old when intersperced with such unrewarding gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1512157140, "timestamp_updated": 1512157140, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.446290", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37981295": {"recommendationid": "37981295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198414809801", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511206813}, "language": "czech", "review": "Funny", "timestamp_created": 1512148023, "timestamp_updated": 1512148023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37978453": {"recommendationid": "37978453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073784500", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511682102}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u54ce\u5440\u597d\u75db\u82e6\u554a~~~~~~~~~\uff01\uff01\uff01\u770b\u82f1\u6587\u597d\u5403\u529b", "timestamp_created": 1512140736, "timestamp_updated": 1512140736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37978112": {"recommendationid": "37978112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049037107", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512133558}, "language": "english", "review": "Game might not be particularly fast, but it is fashionable and being fashionable is just as important as going fast.", "timestamp_created": 1512139803, "timestamp_updated": 1512139803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37938400": {"recommendationid": "37938400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052806955", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 946, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512089177}, "language": "dutch", "review": "Buy if you like to put your arm in spitboxes", "timestamp_created": 1511990480, "timestamp_updated": 1511990480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37934425": {"recommendationid": "37934425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037119743", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512242945}, "language": "english", "review": "If you took Kingdom of Loathing and smashed it together with Fallout 2, I think West of Loathing is what you would get.\n\nThat said, it is fantastic and the only thing it is lacking is Ascension.

There are some pros and cons to the game but it balances out really well to be an enjoyable experience. Might as well give a proper review for a proper game. TLDR at the end.\n\nPros:\n+ It's not linear. Yes, a lot of things you do will have an effect on your ending, and that is all I would want to say without any possible spoilers.\n+ Huge map to explore\n+ On-point Comedy\n+ The characters are VERY well wrtten. An old miner you meet early on, will foreshadow some disturbing things in the game's lore. You MUST talk with everyone in the game, some even have different dialogue after a while.\n+ They make great use of every item in the game. I had to replay two times to even get some specific things, unlike most games where most of what you pick up ends up being \"useless\" and wares.\n+ After the game's \"end\", the game continues and there are more stuff to finish.\n+ Stupid walking. Nuff said.\n\nCons:\n- The inventory is a huge pain in the neck to navigate. By the near end of the game, my inventory was so cluttered that my frames dropped a lot whenever I opened my inventory. Although this only happened because I like to hoard, and the drops were only for a short 2 seconds.\n- Final part of the game. Without spoilers, it's kind of lackluster when you agree to give a 'specific thing'. Honestly, it's much better not to comply by that moment.\n\nNow for some neutral points. These are neither great, nor bad. As evident above, the pros already heavily outweigh the cons, these ones are more of slight nuisances that don't really matter that much, but can help a person who read this know some key features.\n\nNeutrals:\n- Granted the game doesn't really hold your hands, but the buff system was never properly explained. You have 3 buff stats, Grit for Stomach and Pain, Gumption which is AP, Speed, and Spleen, and Glamour which is basically Drops in general and Liver. In your inventory, there are numbers that represent this, and they have slots (0/2 for example). Grit is the most important because of Pain Tolerance, so the higher the number on your Pain Tolerance is, the more you can survive when you die in combat. Every time you get knocked out, you get a perk \"Angry\" which increases all your stats. Food is stomach, pills/drugs are spleen, and liquor is liver.\n- The automatic levelling system is not that great. It's good for balancing stats, but most people on hard mode would want to level their skills and get food buffs early on. Those and dynamites, yeah.\n- The lapels. There are several armor and weapon slots in your inventory, and well, the most useless one is the lapel. Early on it's useful for around an hour then...it loses its value.\n- Grinding. You can grind A LOT in this game, and while it's alright for people like me who grinds commonly in games like Diablo 3, it might be a dealbreaker to some. Keep in mind however, in no way are you required to grind.\n- Crafting components are sometimes named as \"Junk\" or have no value at all. I'm looking at you silver cufflinks.\n\nTLDR; It's a great game. Buy it, especially now it's on a sale, even though it is kinda low for a sale.

The first time I heard about West of Loathing was the day it released on Steam. At that point, I hadn't thought about KoL in YEARS, and had actually forgotten it existed. But my good memories (once I excavated them from under years of dust and rubble) were enough to convince me to buy this game on the spot for full price, which is something I virtually never do (though, really, it has a pretty low price tag, which is nice).\n\nIt was one of the best buys I've made in a long time.\n\nThis game is an RPG, and plays as such. But at its core, this game is about reading. Because, though the RPG elements are perfectly fine, and quite in-depth when it comes to this type of game, when it comes right down to it, we all love this game for the jokes.\n\nThe writing is leaps and bounds beyond any game I have ever come across (which doesn't surprise me, because KoL was the same way, and it's made by the same people). Part of the reason for the stellar writing is the, shall we say, unique art style, which some may find a turn-off. But because of the minimalist nature of the animations, a lot of actions and scenes are written out rather than animated, and it just WORKS. It works so well that I've bought this game several times over and gifted it to my friends because I just love it that much.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIf you enjoy witty humor, reading, and RPGs, get this game for sure, whether on sale or not. Just get it.\n\nIf you prefer serious games, don't like doing a lot of reading in your gaming, or dislike turn-based RPGs, this is not the game for you.\n\n(Also if you don't like stick figures probably don't get it, but eh, it's likely you could still enjoy it.

The soundtrack is also quite pleasing, themed in that Wild West way that brings you in to the world a little bit.\nThe developers have described it as \"Skyrim with beans,\"  which is pretty accurate in a sense that the side quests and exploration are a big part of the game rather than the main storyline.  And there are beans.\nIf you are looking for a game which you can laugh a little, fight a little and not feel a rush to finish then I suggest you pick up this game.", "timestamp_created": 1511419767, "timestamp_updated": 1511419767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36958870": {"recommendationid": "36958870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065149354", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511518614}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite being a regular in the Kingdom of Loathing for several years and knowing more or less what Asymmetric was capable of when it came to writing, West of Loathing is my easy choice for SASC 2017's 'Better than Expected' Award.\n\nAnd that's not even to suggest that my expectations were low coming in; I knew this was a game that I'd enjoy, but it turned out to be so much bigger and more expansive than it appeared at first glance.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the Kingdom, the original text-based, stick-figure MMORPG prides itself on its humorous writing, puzzles and replayability. West of Loathing indeed showcases all of these with trademark charm, but does so with an additional exploration element as the development team stretches out into this different game style.\n\nOf note, the game's simplified turn-based, combat mechanics depend heavily on how you build your character - relatively little strategy is involved when it comes to reacting to random encounters. At times, the combat feels as if it's just... there... as a means to break up the story. I've learned to treat it as a challenge in preparing for combat rather than reacting to tactics-based combat RPG encounters, and in that respect I think it works just fine.\n\nAnd it's all presented in a nice little story arc that never reaches a point of going on too long, making it easy to go back and replay the game again, making different choices and seeing how the world changes.\n\nIt's a worthwhile buy for its writing alone; most who have played it include its humor and story-telling as high marks.

The characters don't have all that much depth other than a tragic backstory or two, but they are consistantly great in every aspect. The combat is great, but the 3-hit combo for the cow puncher kills every single thing in the game in one hit (later on) and some of the follower abilities are underwhelming and downright useless at times. However, the ability to choose a hard mode makes combat alot more involved and rather terrifying. You can't choose hard mode after you leave the first area, so you most likely should get it right away to have a more intense and fun combat experience. The locations are varied with tons of secrets and easter eggs to be found, the map is big enough to keep you exploring for quite a while. The quests are really fun and well made, there are quite a few of them. However, by the end of the game you'll be struggling to find things to do as you probably already found everything.

Let's Plays will spoil it, play it for yourself. You'll be glad you did.\n\nEverything about this game gives the appearance of shallowness, from the stick figures and black and white line drawings, to the silly humor, to the simple mechanics. However, there is a surprising amount of depth here for anyone who cares to dig.\n\nIt's genuinely funny, beyond the silly. A lot of the humor is pretty damned sharp, and it's clear that the creators know about serious comedy. Some of their gags are actually references to much older acts, not to mention a lot of inside jokes from the comedian community.\n\nThe silly, though, is done to perfection. There is a constant delivery of lines or actions that catch you off guard, and make you laugh unexpectedly.\n\nThe gameplay has depth, too. There is marrow beneath the bone white surface. With the fights, it's not apparent until some of the the later levels that strategy is important (it is quite possible to grind to over-level most battles, though).\n\nAlso, there is so much stuff to do and get and discover, you can't possibly experience everything without multiple play-throughs. Optimizing your skills and equipment to your play-style is easy and has a noticeable effect. Random things will pop-up too, and also things that seem random but aren't, and that helps to keep things fresh. There are a lot of adventure game puzzle elements, too, in that whole mess. They don't ever bog the game down or get you stuck, it's just more game-gravy if you want it.\nIt's not perfect, by any means. The music is fantastic, but incredibly repetitive. A lot of the smaller battles could be put on auto, you seriously don't need to be there for them. Grinding is a thing: it's too tempting not to do it, but incredibly boring once you get on the treadmill. As cute as the graphics are, they will strain your eyes after a while. The menu is amusing as hell, but could use some functional tweaking.\n\nPlay it for the lols, just don't be surprised if you keep playing it because it's actually quite good.", "timestamp_created": 1510767909, "timestamp_updated": 1510767909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36532277": {"recommendationid": "36532277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328743170", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511835358}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7279\u522b\u559c\u6b22\u753b\u98ce\u548c\u65e0\u5398\u5934\u9ed1\u8272\u5e7d\u9ed8\u3002\u5267\u60c5\u4e5f\u6bd4\u8f83\u5173\u8054\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u6ca1\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\u90fd\u5f88\u597d\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1510756064, "timestamp_updated": 1510756064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36518973": {"recommendationid": "36518973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025282306", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504322561}, "language": "english", "review": "Just like Asymmetric's online classic Kingdom of Loathing, West of Loathing is good-natured, hilarious, and chock full of genuinely interesting RPG mechanics.

So first off,\n\nCombat - 9/10 - The combat in this game follows a standard turn based combat system, with multiple statistics for each enemy, and multiple attacks especially for you. However, on standard mode, you can easily farm experience to become exeptionally stronger than your enemies. Luckily, hard mode, which can be enabled via a hat, called the Hard Hat, obtained in the prologue of the game.\n\nCompanions - 7/10 - There are five companions in this game, not counting the temporary summoned ones. Your main companion is obtained through the prologue, and there is an additional companion unlocked in the buffalo pile, named Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo Bill. Buffalo Bill cannot be controlled by the player, adding a wild card to combat. He does not appear out of combat and the initial discovery, and is completely optional and easy to miss. The other companions appear in and outside of companions, and will make comments on locations, or mark locations on your map matching their area of expertise. \nSusy Cochrane is a former rancher, and will mark ranch themed locations on your match. She utilises a rifle in combat, doing damage to individual enemies. She also can unlock a lasso skill, temporarily stunning enemies, and gains exp from killing cows. \nDoc Alice is a doctor obsessed with the undead, and will mark graveyards on the map. She utilises a shotgun in combat, doing little damage to mulitple enemies. She can also unlock an attack that will instantly kill skeletons, yet is useless against other enemies. She gains exp from killing skeletons, but will also leave you if you become the Necromancer at the end of the Necromancer side quest. \nCrazy Pete is a former miner, who has gone insane. He will mark mines on your map. He uses an attack that does hot damage to an enemy, which can be exeptionally good, or next to useless depending on the enemy. He likely has another attack, but I honestly haven't played with him that much, and never leveled him up enough to unlock his other attacks. He gains instant levels, via random encounters.\nGary the Goblin is a goblin, and will mark goblin occupied locations on your map. He uses an attack that does little damage, but he preforms the attack multiple times. He can unlock another attack, producing an identical copy of himself with slightly worse stats. He gains instant levels by you purchasing \"Shroom-Gro\" and giving it to him. This obviously the most expensive companion in the game, as Shroom-Gro multiplies in price every time you buy it, but also the most comical.\n\nReplayability - 4/10 - I have played this with each companion and class, and while there are choices in the game, you really only have to play this game three times to experience everything, which is why it gets a low rating. If the developers would update this game like they frequently did with KoL, it would surely add to the longevity and replayability of this game. There is DLC to this game, however it is simply bought in KoL and unlocks cosmetic horse armour. It really doesn't do anything. In comparison, I've spent 59 hours in this game, and 413 hours in Fallout 4, which is a game everybody should buy.\n\nExploration - 8/10 - This is an open world game, meaning you can visit anywhere you want, when you want. The map is unlocked in four parts. The proluge, and then the main area, divided into three seperate areas. You unlock the areas by firstly completing the prologue, then progressing through the main questine will unlock the other two areas. There are alot of locations to discover, and is very fun. However, as I said before, updates and/or DLC would definitely make the game better and more expansive. \n\nStoryline and Quests - 8/10 - There are many little side quests and three main storylines. The side quests consist of trapping the infernal Duke Bovicus, leader of the satanic cows, tracking down items to summon a shiny skeleton named Dave, and locating skeletons for the Petting Cemetary. The three main storylines consist of helping the railway reach the town of Frisco, which serves to unlock the map in the WoL. There's also the El Vabrito questline, which is the player attempting to save the world of Loathing by repairing the containment for an evil diety called Roberto, who will destroy loathing if the containment fails in 420 years. Lastly, is the necromancer questline, which consists of the player attempting to find clues to the location of the Necromancer, who is terrorizing the world of Loathing with his undead army. It ultimately ends with the player eaither destroying the Necromancer, stopping the necromancer from raising more of the dead, or becoming the Necromancer and taking the army for yourself, if you have enough skill in Nex-Mex.\n\nFinal Rating - 7/10 - A very good game, with lots of intentionally bad jokes. As I've said multiple times before, however, DLC and/or updates would definitely make this game alot better. Still, if are contemplating buying it, I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1507504144, "timestamp_updated": 1507504144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35577196": {"recommendationid": "35577196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087939163", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513512384}, "language": "english", "review": "Spittoon Simulator 2017 is the best game of the year, if not the best game ever.

That being said it does a wonderful job doing both of theses things, using a combination of word play and incredibly humourous moments. the game gives you a little choice at times which is always welcome, it's nothing major, just a few dialouge diffferences and maybe different fights and loot. \n\nI probably don't need to tell you this, but the graphics are not anything to go crazy over. The game seems to be aware of this fact though, and embraces it, a very \"when life gives you lemons aproach.\" the music and sound effects feel very fitting for a western setting, the bangs of bullets and twangs of the backround music really compliment the atmosphere nicely. Every attack and action feels like it has some weight thanks to the sound design.\n\nThe gameplay loop is simple, find a new location, explore it, loot it, laugh, and repeat. offering a large amount of sidequests on the way. The gameplay is at it's strongest early on, when you feel vurnerable, like anything can go wrong at any second. Early fights are moderately challenging. later on sadly, the game becomes obsurdly easy, I 3 shot the final boss. however form my understanding, there is a hard mode in the game, you just need to find it. \n\nSo yeah, I quite enjoyed west of loathing, the game making me laugh sevreral time and offering a genrally pleasent experience.", "timestamp_created": 1507004812, "timestamp_updated": 1507004821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35434695": {"recommendationid": "35434695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032231846", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511081182}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

Some are small (for example, a small collection of clues to a puzzle waiting to be solved), while others are quite vast.\n\nThe joy of WoL is following each of those threads to completion, and finding all the possible resolutions that are available, be they interesting, silly, confusing, new pieces of equipment, etc.\n\nI mentioned earlier that your choices will affect the game. This isn't taken lightly in WoL...so if you want to experience everything this game has to show, expect to play through it multiple times.\n\nIf this sounds good to you, then WoL should make for a fine purchase indeed.", "timestamp_created": 1506518250, "timestamp_updated": 1506518250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35237283": {"recommendationid": "35237283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096200616", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506731935}, "language": "english", "review": "A few disclaimers before I begin: \n\n1. I had never heard of Kingdom of Loathing prior to discovering this game, and as such I have never played it before.  \n2. I bought this because I watched a let's play of the beginning bits and my curiosity was piqued.  I highly recommend that if this game sounds like something you want to buy, *do not* do this.  You do not want the feeling of \"Oh I've heard this joke before,\" as the comedy is worth experiencing for the first time on your own.\n\nOverview:\nAfter picking a name and gender for your character, you are given the option of magic-wielder, melee fighter, or a rogue/thief class.  (For the record, in my one playthrough I have completed thus far, I picked magic).  Your character has decided to leave your family's farm to go west, where small towns and demon cows are awaiting.  That's basically all of the story in a nutshell.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n- Laugh-Out-Loud Funny  \n\nSeemingly everything has a goofy description, a peculiar story, or is just a strange thing in general that will probably make you crack a smile.  This humor is not high-brow, but it doesn't have to be.  If you allow it, this story will make you laugh.  The game thrives on player exploration, so you are doing yourself and the game a disservice if you do not check out everything you can.\n\n- Surprisingly Open-Ended\n\nInstead of formal levels, the progression in this RPG is mostly through using XP to increase stats.  In a way very reminiscent of Fallout, having certain stats a high enough level will allow you to avoid the game becoming a series of never-ending fights, while also hiding some of the game's best gags.  Of course, no one will blame you if you mercilessly fight everything that looks at you sideways either.  The game shows you this choice early on when you are first given the option to kill a bandit or talk him out of his life of crime.  Not only that, but the short time you spend with side characters while helping them with their varying problems does often lead to actually helping them.  There's a strange amount of impact you leave on the small game world.  \n\n- Intuitive, Easy Combat\n\nThis is as simple to grasp as it gets. Fighting is standard turn-based fare, with melee weapon, gun, and magic attack options.  Each fight you start with a certain amount of AP which you use to cast spells, but guns and melee weapons are unlimited.  Characters are on a grid, but this really serves no change in combat.  Guns become blocked off by cover (either yours or your enemies) or another enemy standing in front of your target.  Because magic and melee still work in these cases, however, I can't say this made much difference.\n\n- Interesting and Likeable Characters  \n\nFrom the most evil enemies to your choice of \"pardner,\" every npc in this game has an adorable charm.  Part of it is of course the stick figure aesthetic, but characters stand out for their quirkiness and deadpan acceptance of the ridiculous world they live in.  Some moments with characters are even downright sad in spite of the obvious comedic theme.  One character that you choose from a few options follows you throughout the game as your \"pardner\" and fights in combat with you.  Each of these characters was interesting and I wanted them to go with me for different reasons.  Hearing their dialogue and using their abilities is warranting of multiple playthroughs, as far as I see it.  \n\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n- Little Quest Variety\n\nAlmost every mission, whether it's part of the main quest or not, is at the heart of it a fetch quest.  Characters have lost this or that, or had it stolen, and it's up to you to find it (and you'll probably have to kick some ass to get to it).  The game seems to make fun of itself for this late in the game during one of the main story missions, with your main character actually getting pretty frustrated at a particularly ridiculous endeavor.  For me though, this was just a reminder of how I was beginning to grow tired of the superficiality of the actual tasks I was doing.  I often used the ability to ask my \"pardner\" where I was supposed to go next for the various side missions just because I started getting bored of quests and would go off exploring instead.\n\n- Combat Growing Tedious\n\nAs I said previously, I played the magic-casting \"beanslinger\" class so my best attacks were spells that I learned from books I found throughout the world.  Once I had found a combo of spells that allowed me to take a good chunk of health from an enemy in turn one, there was no reason to do anything else.  Battles started to become all the same, and I started spacing out while doing them just to get to more of the funny dialogue.  One particular annoyance came in a fight which had three enemies attacking me and 2 others buffing the whole team's attack and defense each turn.  I had to kill the attackers first so that I wouldn't be killed (more an annoyance that anything, as you can come right back), but this left the other two enemies with 100+ hp health bars buffing themselves into oblivion.  By the time I was fighting only them, they had buffed themselves so much that I could only do 1 damage at a time to them, and had to just speed up the combat speed in the options menu and wittle them both down one at a time.  This is of course a worst-case scenario, but as I said just going through the motions once you are super strong quickly becomes the worst part of the game.\n\nTHE UGLY:\n\n-The Ending (NO SPOILERS!) \n\nThe game just sort of ends once you complete the last mission of the \"main\" storyline.  You are free to watch the ending cutscene, as well as go right back into the world and complete any remaining sidequests, but there's something so dissatisfying about it.  It's a feeling of reading a very good joke book, and the empty feeling you get when you close the back cover.  \n\n\nTL;DR, West of Loathing is game that is a solid RPG that just barely overstays its welcome.  It's hilarious for people who don't mind some simple humor, but the game design could have used a bit more complexity.  \n\nIf you don't mind an RPG not being very deep in its mechanics and instead being a charming, ridiculous world, West of Loathing is your game.  You're either going to play it once, enjoy it, but never feel a need to play it again, or want to try every \"pardner\" and replay for hard mode and show all of your friends.  \n\nFor the low price, the length and potential replayability, and the enjoyment I personally got from it, I can whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone looking for a chill time and a good laugh.", "timestamp_created": 1506497611, "timestamp_updated": 1506497892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35229335": {"recommendationid": "35229335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025343806", "num_games_owned": 804, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506403776}, "language": "english", "review": "Completed my first play-through this game at 9 hours.

Part Spaghetti Western, part Eastwood Western, part Monty Python, but all fun and hilarity.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nThe story in West of Loathing is one of love and loss. You are the witty protagonist, a stick man teen set off from his family\u2019s home to explore the world. Unfortunately, Cows from Hell are rampaging all along the countryside, and so you begin investigating that while simply exploring your world, meeting new stick people and forming friendships (and enmities) along the way.\n\nThe comedy in West of Loathing never relents, and is very much in the fusion of Clint Eastwood meets The Holy Grail. Of course, this is a western, but the memes and pop culture references also never relent, and to optimal effect. The writing is just awesome, tongue in cheek, and hilarious.\n\n9 out of 10\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nWest of Loathing is a stickman game, and so you can expect sketch art as the medium of expression here. Mostly black and white, minimalist sketch art. Again, this is done to optimal effect and it really becomes endearing and comfortable. While the artwork is sparse, it is as evocative as it is effective. Also, the style really assists in the healthy serving of sarcastic exposition you will encounter throughout.\n\n9 out of 10\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe gameplay in West of Loathing is really a combination of 2-D open world exploration and JRPG style combat.\n\nThere is an overlay map, from which you will explore the open terrain finding towns, old mines, ranches, forts, and other random spots. The 2-D map, from which you will handle direct exploration, combat, dialogue, and so on is set up in pretty basic fashion. You have your base areas and then buildings/caves/etc\u2026that you can explore. No one area  is very large, but each makes complete sense as far as its design goes and fits perfectly with the overall theme of the game.\n\nThe combat system is handled in traditional JRPG style face offs with some very forgiving RNG\u2019s (random number generators), base attacks, special attacks, and of course item usage. It\u2019s actually a pretty easy game and you really shouldn\u2019t die very often.\n\nTo assist in this, you have an infinite number of inventory slots with which to carry the various  weapons, limited use items (such as food and drink for buffs, items which cause specific types of damage, healing objects, lockpicks, and of course crafting materials.\n\nCrafting is an essential part of this game and you will craft a lot of items through the course of your adventure. It happens in a variety of ways as well. For example, you will need a stove to bake bans, a silversmiths table to craft silver bullets and lockpicks, etc...\n\nAdditionally, you can and will build relationships, via conversations and/or side quests. The side quests often poke fun at the standard RPG tropes by making you do them almost to the point of exhaustion while also making fun of the situation as you do. In fact, this game in general is about breaking down and making fun of the RPG standards.\n\nThere is actually quite a bit more to this surprisingly deep game, but I\u2019ll leave off for now.\n\n9 out of 10\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\n\nThe audio is actually done to perfection. From the ambient sounds you would expect from a western to music that would fit in any Clint Eastwood film, you are in for a treat with regards to the audio in West of Loathing.\n\n10 out of 10\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nWest of Loathing is a game that, simply by appearance, can be easily dismissed. However, that would be a mistake as it actually ended up being an excellent game worthy of at least on and possibly even two or three playthroughs. You will be doing yourself a favor by picking this one up.\n\n9.3 belligerent and drunk stick man horses out of 10 possible. The other .7?

You have a number of \"Action Points\" that let you do special actions on your turn and they refresh between battles, and once you're out during combat you can either snort some smelling salts or just do basic attacks. It's so easy that you could probably expect a ten year old to grasp it within a minute or so. \n\nThere are 3 classes in the game you can be and they all get their own style of fighting. They're your standard archetypes of fighter, mage, and thief. You can also have a \"pardner\" NPC that helps you out in combat whom can also level up with you. They all fight in their own way as well, so you have some incentive beyond just reading their unique dialog to pick a new one each playthrough.\n\nIf you're looking for hardest game ever, look elsewhere. The combat here is easily cheesed once you find the first \"grinding\" zone near the starter town, which lets you attack a group of enemies forever to grind out XP to level up. Plus, combat items don't end your turn if they're used, so you could stock up on poisons and dynamite to obliterate every enemy in your way.\n\nFor people who want a harder game, there is a hard mode that can be unlocked in the prologue. You can also intentionally forgo having a pardner join you in the game if you enjoy having harder combat and less funny dialog. \n\nLevelling up is done either by auto-levelling (Don't do this) or by point buying via accumulated XP. There are several skills you can level up, some of which are unique to which class you pick. Further skills can be picked up in-game by reading skill magazines that you will lose every single time after reading them just once. But fear not: You can easily acquire every skill in the game and still have a few skill books left over.\n\n[b]Story[/b]:\n\nThe story is simple, like much of the game. You're out West, you're trying to get to Frisco, and there's baddies and obstacles in the way. However, the main quest is not all there is to do. There's a lot of sidequests to do, each with their own little story to tell, and this is where the game REALLY shines.\n\nThe writing is absolutely fantastic. Unless you have no sense of humor, I guarantee that the game will make you laugh quite a few times, and merely sensibly chuckle some other times. Your potential pardners all have unique dialog and their own personal stake in one of several sidequests in the main game. Everything in the game is designed to give you a good laugh and enjoy yourself, so it's wise to go into this game not taking anything too seriously.\n\nOnce you reach the end of the game (This takes about 8 hours if you're insistent on doing every single thing possible in the most timely manner, it can be much shorter if you beeline through the main quest) you're allowed to continue adventuring and completing sidequests. However, there ARE multiple endings, of a sort! Depending on which sidequests you complete and how you complete them, the ending cutscene will change! Don't expect some big world shattering difference to occur that rocks you to your core, but at least know that the game will acknowledge that you did indeed bother to fulfill sidequests and change your ending for it.\n\n[b]Overall[/b]:\n\nIf you like funnyman writing filled with sarcasm and snark and aren't looking for a game that intends to really \"challenge\" you outside of hard mode, this game is for you. There's plenty of locations to visit and sidequests to do, certainly enough to kill an afternoon or two. You can also get some replay value out of the game via achievements (There is no way to get every single one in one or two playthroughs), hard mode, classes, and selecting a new pardner.\n\nIf you end up enjoying the game, I'd also recommend you pay a visit to the Kingdom of Loathing itself.

It's absolutely NOTHING like Fallout. With that said, it's a very entertaining game. It feels like a web game on crack.

I'm not a huge fan of games that focus more on being funny than gameplay, but this game succeeds. Also, all the characters you meet throughout the game are all very charming. Nothing is done to death, and you get just enough of everything to keep you  satisfied. \n\nHowever I definitely have some gripes. It's entirely way too easy. It almost feels like I'm watching a video because of how easy it is. There really isn't anything to discover, because everything is right out in the open. The game is short. You can't tell by my played time, but a simple \"How Long to Beat West of Loathing\" will tell you it only takes about 12 hours. \n\nOverall, the small price tag, the charming writing, and the general feel of the game makes me able to recommend it to others. I do hope they plan to add more content down the road. \n\nIf you want a number score, based on the ambiguity of my review, I'd give it a 6.5 to 7 out of 10.

Otherwise the battles are pretty trivial. If you do put the hard hat on, make sure you select the option to distribute your XP manually instead of letting the game allocate it for you.

In a nutshell its dad humour, dry over the top jokes that make you ashamed of yourself just for laughing at them.\n\nIf you decide to purchase this, Your first playthrough should take somewhere between 10 and 15 hours providing that you are reading everything and not just skipping conversations and then asking your \"pardner\" what to do.\n\nAlso if you are looking for a challenge there is a hard (hat) Mode,\n\n10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1505767028, "timestamp_updated": 1511380605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504249", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35048376": {"recommendationid": "35048376", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000437490", "num_games_owned": 972, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503173620}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly fantastic.", "timestamp_created": 1505751378, "timestamp_updated": 1505751378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475905", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35042729": {"recommendationid": "35042729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079646340", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506887102}, "language": "english", "review": "Funny RPG game with tons of jokes, references, silly locations and funny storyline.

I'm not even joking.  There are two reasons I did this: 1) achievements and 2) this game is ridiculously fun and entertaining.  I've spent basically 82 hours playing this game and I had fun each and every time I did it!  Seriously, even though I was basically doing the exact same things as I'd done before over and over, I still thoroughly enjoyed playing.  Which lead me to question how in the world I didn't get tired of the game even remotely.  I came up with a list to answer that question, which I will now share.  \n\nI think a large part of it is the sheer amount of humor in the West of Loathing.  Humor and puns are practically the lifeblood of this game!  There's so much attention to detail, from the bigger stuff like the quests and missions to the smaller stuff like random encounters and even minute details like the personalization of tombstones and notes!  Every single character that appears in the game is unique.  What's more, the way you play and the choices you make affect literally everything in the game, from how the story ends to the encounters you have and the way you handle them.  In all of my playthroughs of this game (and I intend to do at least one or two more), there seemed to always be something new.\n\nI so highly recommend West of Loathing.

West of Loathing has got you covered. It's both bigger and deeper than it appears on first glance. It's silly and wacky and it has heart... Er, I mean, grit. The art style is endearing and often plays off of (and enhances) the writing and storytelling; Seriously, you'll never care as much about the fate of one cactus-slash-man as you will here. And though the endearing style, you're peppered with a good amount of tough choices along the way.\n\nThe combat is its weakpoint. Though fine for the most part and mechanically sound, it does feel like a missed opportunity and could have done with a fair bit of adjustment and far more play-testing. Much too early (like, within one 1/15 of the game) did the fights become trite and, mostly, a question of getting things over with (which also seems to be the case in the playthroughs I've seen online). However, there is the rumour of a hard (and a hardest) mode; I never found the option, so maybe I missed it or it only becomes vailable on a second playthrough.

Yeah, I KoL'd for a long time.  Like, a really long time.  But if you're here reading reviews then you don't give a tinker's damn about that, now, do you!?\n\nFirst thing to look at here is, lemme tell you what kind of people are gonna enjoy this game.  Just do some mental tick-marks in your head, then you can make the call for yourself.  That's why you read reviews, right?  This is what you want, right?  I'm not like, going insane and getting high off the smell of my own farts when I say this?  'Cause the whole point is, you don't care if *I* like the game.  You care if *you* *can* like it.\n\nSo here we go.\n\n- Are you the kind of person who enjoys reading things?  I don't mean learning from reading--I mean the actual engagement with the rhetoric of the thing.  Like, you read it and you think half-seriously about why someone wrote it and what makes it all work, and you get this solid impression of who the writer is, almost like they're your imaginary friend.  In this game, the writer is sort of like your imaginary drinking buddy instead.  Good comic books and their narration boxes would be the best comparison, honestly, since most games are focused on accuracy with their text rather than entertainment.  Which is a bit silly when you think about it, because of this next point:\n- Would you appreciate the subtle difference between a game that doesn't take itself seriously, and a game that takes itself only as seriously as it needs to?  Now, you can enjoy being the harsh critic and tearing into all the plot holes, pointing out the weaknesses and the shortcomings and where the payoff wasn't worth the investment.  Fine.  That's just being an aware, functional human being who's not liable to getting screwed at every corner.  That's not what I'm talking about.  Can you...I dunno...just let go a little bit without feeling like you're betraying that awareness?  Can you be cool about it in *both* non-temperature senses of the word?\n- Do you appreciate the kind of language I'm using so far?  I'm not writing this for dummies.  You do have to have some appreciation of the English language.  Sure, I'm a bit drunk right now, but I am perfectly comfortable with talking about, for example, how this game isn't succinct and ventures into full-on loquaciousness at times, but that that serves a purpose beyond either the mechanics or the strict storyline of the game (which are both independently relevant).  It's because the meta-story matters, too.  Well, it does if you like having fun, at least.\n- Did you figure out by now that maybe I drink to forget all the invasive thoughts that terrorize a fertile mind embedded in a chaotic world?  No, actually, I hope you didn't, because that would seriously justify this sort of weird and unhealthy half-acknowledged egocentrism I have going on.  That doesn't even belong in this review.  Well, maybe it does, because if you actually read further into this bullet-point anyway then it indicates an ongoing curiosity about things that don't actually matter or apply to you.  You thirst for higher knowledge.  You can't help but ponder the ineffable in search for the transcendental.  There's something out there, and you're gonna find it.  Perfect.  I like that.  That definitely applies, then, and hopefully negates my worthless moping.  Because, well, it's not just engagement with the writing but the passion for discovering GOOD writing that matters here.  And you will discover it in this game, but only if you are looking for it.\n- Um...do you have a weird thing about clowns?\n\nThat should be good.  Go play this game, like comment subscribe hit the bell, then go get a life, you poor sumbich.  Your breath is getting in the way of my alcohol.  Get out of here.

The ending cutscene is also like New Vegas, showing you how the different factions you helped or destroyed fare after the story and storylines of individual characters.\n\nThe background of the story is as follows: West of Loathing takes place shortly after an event known as the The Cows having Come Home. As a result of this, the cows have slaughtered many civilians for some unknown reason, but it could be as simple as they were fed up of being food for us humans.\n\nStarting off as a simple man/woman living in a homestead just outside the town of Boring Springs, you're given the choice of setting some backstory for your character as well as their class. I chose to be a witty, gunslinging man who was a Snake Oiler, a sort of thief class that can heal themselves or hurt foes with snake venom harvested from the snakes in their briefcase. Yep, thats a thing.You can also be a fisticuff wielding Cowpuncher or magic using Beanslinger but I have yet to try these.\n\nBoring Springs serves as a tutorial area, once you're done here you can never come back. It teaches you how to fight, buy and sell items, and most importantly, that you can avoid combat almost entirely with the right stats and dialogue choices. Your time here ends after you chase down one of the three unique horses or decide to go for a basic one. I chose the locoweed addicted one myself just for laughs, but the other two choices are a ghost horse and a dark horse.\n\nOne more thing to remember before leaving Boring Springs is to choose whether you want a partner to accompany you or to go solo (if you're brave enough to try). Ultimately I ended up with Susie, a sharpshooter traumatised by the recent death of her family by the arrival of the cows and so harbours an immense hatred for them. The other choices are the old man Pete, doc Alice and a secret one that is best to find out for yourself.\n\nUpon finally leaving Boring Springs, the Wild West is yours to explore to your hearts content. After settling in to a room at the starting area of Dirtwater, the game gives you your main objective to strive for (your companion will remind you if asked, thankfully) and thats that, you can do whatever the hell you want until you feel its time to progress the story, no pressure whatsoever.\n\nThe overworld of West of Loathing and the various locations that make it up consists of settlements, mountains, mines, forts and more to search through. Then you have more unique places like the circus (complete with demon clowns) and a jelly bean museum, and my personal favourite, the Necromancer tower that can be found if you collect all the tomes and clues relating to its location.\n\nBut some of these locations, like the aforementioned Necromancer tower, can't be discovered or entered without a prerequisite item. For example, there's a cave known as the Lost Dutch Oven Mine where you need stench resistance to enter or your character will straight up refuse to go in. Another place like this is the cave place that can only be found by following tracks from another location.\n\nA lot of items and locked doors early on will be inacessible without the required skill or stat, such as safecracking, meaning a lot of backtracking will occur towards the late game. Of course you can ignore these if you so wish but with the short travel time between locations, its not much of a bother to do so. Assuming you don't mind the random encounters on the overworld, but these can be avoided too.\n\nThe dialogue between characters is the best part of the game though, cracking jokes at the expense of other games and itself, referencing well known movies and books, or just being outright silly. Apart from the occasional repeated encounter, I never skipped the dialogue because of this.\n\nXP levels up your stats, of course, and can be farmed infinitely at certain locations, some in particular are great for your character or companion. I myself farmed snakes for their venom which I would then sell for extra meat, and for Susie I farmed cows for a good two hours to boost her stats, resulting in her being able to one shot basically every enemy. Combat is simple enough with just the right amount of depth to it if you want to play a more challenging run.\n\nOverall I got a good 16 hours out of West of Loathing (3-4 of those of was just farming XP), for a game that has the look of a flash browser game I didn't expect to sink this much time into it, nor did I expect to laugh so much.\n\nReview originally posted at:  https://gamefold.co.uk/west-of-loathing-review/\n", "timestamp_created": 1504294681, "timestamp_updated": 1504294681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.772685", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34667163": {"recommendationid": "34667163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001827495", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504294834}, "language": "english", "review": "Jick has a fantastic sense of humor and will always be able to get me to laugh.

The game is full of gags, satire, and absurd logic, and it's all executed perfectly. The humor is easily this game's strongest point for me.\n -The combat system is fun, and allows for lots of creativity in how you approach battles.\n -The art style is simplistic, but pleasing to the eye.\n -You are able to decide what kind of character your protagonist is, with the choices the game gives you. Are they a stone-cold, battle-hungry killer, or do they avoid conflict whenever they have the chance? \n-There's tons of weaponry, apparel, food, and drink to choose from, to really customize your characters stats and fighting style.\n-The music is epic and really enhances the experience.\n-If you're stuck on a quest, there's always something else to do that's fun. \n-You can fast-travel from anywhere, even from inside buildings and caves.\n-You get experience fairly quickly. If you need more experience, there's always places to grind, and battles are so enjoyable in this game that even grinding is a joy.\n\nWhat I don't like about this game:\n-Lockpicking and Safecracking are two very important skills that are difficult to find the skill books for if you made some mistakes in the introductory chapter, leading to a lot of frustration. In addition, the skill books are quite expensive themselves.\n-...that's all I got.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you want a good laugh, enjoy strategic and creative grid-based battles, or just feel like killing demonic cows.", "timestamp_created": 1504230635, "timestamp_updated": 1504230635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525579", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34648680": {"recommendationid": "34648680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058253887", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511999421}, "language": "english", "review": "11/10 just because of the yeast beast boss fight", "timestamp_created": 1504229321, "timestamp_updated": 1504229321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34648621": {"recommendationid": "34648621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314518962", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505010451}, "language": "english", "review": "vry gud. wuld recmmnd 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1504229063, "timestamp_updated": 1504229063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34647404": {"recommendationid": "34647404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170408909", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505138638}, "language": "english", "review": "A funny, simplistic, and, most of all, fun game.

As such, the humour and puns of KoL were an integral part of my life growing up (and also explains in part why I'm such a stickler for bad puns). I eventually quit KoL after losing millions of meat while gambling. Kids, gambling is bad, m'kay?\n\nThe announcement of West of Loathing really excited me, for multiple reasons - firstly, because it was set in the same universe as KoL; secondly, because it was a proper Steam game; thirdly, because it just looked freaking amazing. It's basically Skyrim but with a lot less real-time travelling, tons to explore, and the return of Meat as currency.\n\nThere are a lot of locations, and exploring every nook and cranny of them will reveal even more secrets elsewhere. That was part of the magic of KoL, exploring and figuring out secrets and puzzles on your own. Grab a notebook - there's a ton to remember at any one time, you'll likely forget a few things here and there, such is the magnitude of the number of things you can really do. Some achievements are rewarded for finishing some of these secrets, which span basically most of the game, giving incentive to actually chase them. You likely won't get everything on your first playthrough, but the game adequately counters that with the option for multiple save files - plus you can still continue a save file even after you've hit the end on that file.\n\nAnd then, the writing. You're going to lose your sides over and over again. There is a ton of hilarious puns and well-written humour everywhere. One of the best bits about this game are the spittoon exploration moments where the disgusting details of your dank diving into the dark depths of the salty spittoons just for egregious equipment is deftly described in putrid prose. \n\nThere's a lot of depth in combat, with a choice between 3 classes, and of 1 pardner from a total of 4 (3 have to be unlocked), each with their different traits and abilities, and a lot of skills to discover and learn, giving you freedom to spec your character. You can either casually let the game build up your character by leveling skills in a specific manner, or you can build it up yourself. You'll want this degree of freedom later on when attempting the challenge of Hard Mode in a single in-game day.\n\nLast but not least, stupid walking. Need I say more?\n\n[h1]When to buy[/h1]\nIf I'm being honest, $11 (that's ridiculous. It's not even funny.) is a freaking huge steal for what you get. I highly recommend exploring every single nook and cranny. There's so much amazing writing everywhere, and I'm pretty sure there are some bits I've missed, despite 100%ing the game.\n\n[h1][b]9.5/10[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1503971814, "timestamp_updated": 1503983694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 109, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.879348", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34566411": {"recommendationid": "34566411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121829667", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1513824434}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game consisting of puzzles, puns, and the old west.

Non-linear story progession, and ample amount of meaningful options can never go wrong.

But along the way you can find different fictions, individuals, and elements. All these factors clashes and intertwines into a grand world. But all lines are thoroughly developed with clear motives, goals, and proper potential endings. It may be complex, but never disorganized. \n\nThe game is TEXT HEAVY, in both quality and quantity. Through these words, humor shines and imagination thrives. Through these words, stick figures come to life and (AMAZINGLY) becoming distinguishable characters.

Plus it comes with some fries!\n\nI admit that analogy got away from me. Anyways.\n\nOverall, WoL might not have the deepest mechanics, but like Psychonauts or Thomas Was Alone, the lighter gameplay is more a vehicle for superb writing and a very fulfilling sense of fun and enjoyment. WoL is not only amusing, it is also frequently and genuinely laugh out loud funny. And while a lot of the jokes are sophmoric, WoL is never a mean game. You get the sense that the creators are fans of Westerns & weird genre mashups, and aren't afraid to lampoon themselves as much as their sources of inspiration.\n\nAnd boy, the game is filled to bursting with terrible puns, but the kind where you go \"Man, that's terrible. I wish I had thought of that\".\n\nThere are also a surprisingly large rane of options for resolving encounters and quests within the game, almost all of which have unique dialogue and story text.\n\nWhile I definitely recommend West of Loathing, there are some issues. The RPG element is a little shallow. Your character will quickly outstrip your \"pardner\" in power and the fight mechanics seem to emphasize damage over everything else. So there are a bunch of summoning, protective and buffing skills that just dont appear very useful. And in both of my playthroughs I ended up with too many skills and not enough XP to level them all up, so I ended up relying on just two or three skills during the turn based fights.\n\nFurthermore, WoL isn't very difficult (there is a hard mode and I didn't try it, so it may make a big difference for how the fights go). The combat is almost toothless and there's no real penalty for failing anything. On the other hand, I think the attraction is the story and jokes, so that wasn't a big deal for me.\n\nMy main complaint is that some of the quests/puzzles are a little obtuse. On my second playthrough I had to look a bunch of stuff up on a guide. I had not followed the exact sequence of questions with a NPC to trigger a big side quest, and I hadn't read the description on an item to progress one of the 3 main story quests because I had missed that I even collected the item (seriously, there are too many items). It's a little inconsistent that some quests are so maddeningly specific with how you need to complete them, while most of the others have 3 or more possible solutions, is all I'm saying. And the solution to one of the (admittedly optional) puzzles in the game apparently is from random encounters you have while wandering from place to place, and none of those encounters came up in either of my games.\n\nBut just because a game isn't perfect doesn't mean it isn't very, very good. If you like offbeat humor, a great setting, some very clever subversions of expectations and can put up with a near constant barrage of puns, you should definitely check out West of Loathing.", "timestamp_created": 1503900580, "timestamp_updated": 1503901317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34545239": {"recommendationid": "34545239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009412850", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503932319}, "language": "english", "review": "West of Loathing is everything that made the web game Kingdom of Loathing fun at its best, minus the grinds at its worst. Great writing and amusing jokes with subtle humour in a wacky universe that is yet internally consistent. Little need for familiarity with similar titles (including Kingdom of Loathing) or gaming in general to get into it. An role-playing game that focusses on writing and player choice over numbers, forced routes or flashy animations. You actually play a role in this one.\n\nWhilst many triple A and indie titles alike are deeper than they appear on the surface, Loathing really hits that sweet spot of surprising depth hidden beneath a whimsical clean and simple interface. The Wild West setting really gives the game a tight focus, and the character selection process is organic and layered throwing the baggage inherited from Dungeons and Dragons that plagues the genre out the window. Instead of a complex character selection screen to uhm and ahh over, Loathing opts for a Witcher 2 approach, whereby decisions you make in the early stages of the game have a lasting impact over the rest of the title. Your \"pardner\" is essentially part of your starting class, but instead framed as a narrative decision. The book you choose is your initial skillpoint allocation, your horse, your perks. Some seemingly minor decisions early on frame the limits of your ethical alignment. This does unfortunately bring me to one of the disappointments of the title. About 1/4 of the way into the game, these decisions start to peter out. It's not a biggie, but it was sad to see one of the most critically acclaimed elements of the game (a barrage of meaningful decisions that are contextually appropriate in effect and scope but subtle enough for the player to not skip a beat) not stick around for the long haul.\n\nThere is however one big glaring issue in the title: difficulty. In giving you so many options, including non-lethal ones, the game is essentially a joke. Nothing will set you up for even temporary failure. What's worse is that this removes the feeling of conseuence much of time. Why bother setting up solution A when solution B and C are already unlocked? Even simple stat checks are likely to be surpassed by the time you encounter them if you've spent any time exploring and enjoying the rich content on offer.\n\nWhat's even more glaring is this: there is a secret hard mode, I discovered it by accident, chose it and still found the game way too easy.\n\nI mean, this is ultimately self-defeating. Difficulty in a game like Loathing is not a matter of how skilled the player is, but on how much the game is going to expect you to tinker, experiment, explore and prepare for gateway challenges. The hard hat in particular fails in this regard because by ratcheting up the combat challenge a little, it forces you to explore non-lethal solutions or rely on consumables when you make a mistake but then turns around and removes some of the most ingenious and complex non-lethal options from you by disallowing you from switching hats, limiting your horse/pardner options, or in the case of the final set of decisions, outright robbing you of alternate options rendering the rewards from all the major story-spanning sidequests completely irrelevant!\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend the title, and really wish for a follow-up, but I hope the developers re-assess the relationship between combat difficulty and exploration (both in-universe and mechanical) from a player perspective in order to better balance their future work. Perhaps scaling the combat difficulty to how many elements of the tutorial the player interacts with?\n\nExpected play time: For the first playthrough, expect 8 hours if focussed on your goals and 16 hours for full exploration. Due to the number of decisions early on, and puzzles you only get one shot at, you'd need an estimated 2-3 playthroughs to exhaust all the content, leading to perhaps 30+ hours for a full completionist.", "timestamp_created": 1503896772, "timestamp_updated": 1503897706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34545022": {"recommendationid": "34545022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198329082722", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503652879}, "language": "schinese", "review": "Nice game and we need Chinese\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1503895548, "timestamp_updated": 1503895548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 94, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.874813", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34543428": {"recommendationid": "34543428", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982567490", "num_games_owned": 558, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 5773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508220774}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is magnificent!

BUY WEST OF LOATHING!!! This game is amazing. It's a Comical, turn based, rpg. The fighting system is rewarding and the enimies are unique: You go from fighting ghosts,to typical cowboys, to demon cow heads on fire. To fight these unique enemies, you can choose from three classes: Mage, Melle/Brue type, and the Assassin class. You are also given cool items as you go along, things like dynamite to do damage to the enemy while you can get items like beer that increases muscle or you can get health regen items. I thought the game would be mostly toilet humor, but I was very suprised, it has minimum toilet humor and when it does, It makes fun of the fact that the game has toilet humor, it is amazing. The basic artstyle gets me evrytime I load up the game, everyone loves the 3d super advanced graphics, but this game shows that you don't need good graphics to make a great game.

The dialog and descriptions of objects are funny without being groan-worthy or memey.   The game for me soon became more about reading everything I could because I really enjoyed the (sometimes self aware) humor throughout the game.\n\nFor the RPG side of it, you get to choose from  melee, ranged or magic user choices; the magic user is called a beanslinger so I went with that one.  You use the world map to travel around from location to location and you'll get random encounters during your travels a lot of the time.   As you gain exp (often not from combat but through dialog or skillful use of your , well skills) you use the exp gained to level up various skills that you get at the start, or gain throughout the game from looted/found skill books.  \n\nI did not find the combat very challenging, and that was perfectly ok because I was playing the game entirely for the story/writing by the time I realized it was easy.   There are several places in the game where you can create an infinite number of combat encounters for yourself so you can make it as easy or hard on yourself by choosing or not choosing to grind up a little.   (edit: a hard mode exists, I wasn't aware, but it's a spoilery kinda thing so search at your peril)\n\nI played from start to finish and completed almost every side quest, afked a little, and it took me about 15 hours of playtime.  I did not hurry in any sense, I took my time and enjoyed the narratives and descriptions along the way.\n\nFew pros: \n-excellent writing\n-good humor that doesn't insult the player, not a collection of memes to be 'funny'\n-plenty to do lots of side quests and interesting random encounters\n-can be played almost entirely using just the mouse, you'll need the keyboard sometimes though\n-appropriate music for the setting, though I admit it got a little repetitive after 15 hours\n-lots of non-combat skills that affect a lot of things throughout the game, I didn't feel cheated spending exp on these skills\n-for a stick figure game the animations and art really conveyed a lot, well done game creators!\n-stupid walk mode!\n\nA few cons:\n-not a con for me, but the combat can be quite easy if you grind up a little exp and spend it on combat skills (EDIT: i was informed that a hard mode exists, so look into that if you want!)\n-the game is in black and white until a little ways into the game where you can unlock a sorta sepia toned background, I found it to be hard on my eyes until I had the more tan colored option unlocked\n-I personally found it a little difficult to remember where certain NPCs or items were again when I had to backtrack or returned to the game after a day or two break; finding this information to help me on the internet was easy but ingame could have used a little more direction, or maybe if I could have put notes on the map I could have helped myself but that wasn't an option\n\nRecommended if you like RPGs that are witty and humorous with a lot of well written dialog and descriptions.", "timestamp_created": 1503622917, "timestamp_updated": 1503634634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.830596", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34470046": {"recommendationid": "34470046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031892535", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502937280}, "language": "english", "review": "5 words: grandma's briefcase full of snakes \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat is all", "timestamp_created": 1503617804, "timestamp_updated": 1503617804, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471074", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34467935": {"recommendationid": "34467935", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116694730", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512347913}, "language": "english", "review": "what", "timestamp_created": 1503608750, "timestamp_updated": 1503608750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471074", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34467615": {"recommendationid": "34467615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025261293", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1513868960}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a big fan of Asymmetric's previous games (even the one they don't like to talk about, Word Realms), so my expectations for this game were pretty high.\n\nIt actually exceeded my expectations.\n\nThe game isn't long if you just blow through the main quest, but so much of the meat (no pun intended) of the game is not in that main quest.   And those sidequests are full of surprises that I won't spoil here.\n\nIf I had a main complaint about the game, it's that you can get pretty darn powerful, but you never really have anything to use that power on.   There's no real powerful boss fights.  (The hardest fights are ones against multiple mid-level enemies rather than against a single powerful enemy)  Even the Final Boss is not only fairly weak, but entirely skippable if you know what you're doing.\n\nBut that's it, really.

Funny, witty, clever, and with a surprisingly extensive amount of content.   Given the low price and the game's appearance, I figured it might be a long evening's work.  In fact I sunk nearly 24 hours into over several days - and despite my best efforts, I know I still didn't see all the game has to offer.\n\nIf I had to make a complaint it would be that the combat was so easy as to be basically trivial - I lost only three fights throughout the whole game, and even those I only lost because I had got so used to winning every battle in one or two turns that I no longer bothered checking enemy stats before piling in.  The game was still great fun, but it could have been even more fun (and even more of a time sink) had I had to think and strategise even a little during combat.  \n\nThere's a way of making the game harder by finding a \"hard hat\" which is only available at the very start and then only if you very luckily follow the exact right steps, or (more likely) Google how to find it.  That's another small gripe - I wished I had a chance of finding it on my first playthrough so as to be able to make the game more challenging.

It is possible to miss stuff entirely, or miss a different solution to a problem. Going back to old areas is often profitable due to increase in off-combat skills, like lockipicking and safecracking, which open up new opportunities for loot.\nIf you don't enjoy reading and usually skip any lore/book items in games, this game is probably not for you.

KoL features the same caliber of writing and puzzles, but it's limited in many ways to keep you playing over time- a restricted amount of playable turns per day, content exclusive to calendar holidays, that sort of stuff.\n\nWith that in mind, and having played KoL for so long, I feel confident in saying that West of Loathing is everything I ever wanted out of an Asymmetric title. Core to any \"of Loathing\" experience is the writing, and the writing in WoL is some of the most lovingly crafted that I've ever seen in a game. In a lot of game reviews where writing features heavily, now would be the time to invoke certain old, text-heavy titles like Planescape: Torment or the original Fallout, but they don't represent what I mean when I call the writing \"lovingly crafted.\" There's something about West of Loathing that feels personal and warm, as if all the jokes in the writing are jokes being told to you by an old friend during a long-awaited hangout session.\n\nThe combat, let's be real, is a little rudimentary. It's Paper Mario without the fun and flashy combos. There's a sense of strategy starting out with regard to what companion joins you on your journey, and acquisition of skills ends fairly quickly, leaving you with a reliable pool of abilities to get through most any encounter- but that's about it. Each class does rely on gear entirely differently, which is at least good for replay value- and that's something this game does in fact encourage.\n\nGo into the journey West with the expectation that you will botch a number of things the first time through. The game allows you to fail on more than one occasion- I myself was permanently banned from the circus on my first playthrough, and on that very same playthrough did irreversible damage to equipment that would have provided my party with a pretty exciting upgrade. But sometimes missing the mark can actually create even more gameplay- showing up to one of the game's later areas without a requisite item will actually unlock an entire, lengthy quest sequence you'd otherwise miss!\n\nIf I had to sum up West of Loathing in one word, I'd call it \"charming.\" Its art style doesn't leave anything to be desired, despite the characters being represented as stick figures. The animations are lively, varied, and exceptionally smooth. It much more faithfully calls to mind imagery of being bored in class and doodling in a notebook than any number of games that have deliberately sought out that aesthetic.\n\nIf you're a thorough explorer, you'll see all that WoL has to offer in slightly shorter order than some large open-world games, but you can expect to see much greater variation from place to place than those games tend to offer. The West in West of Loathing is full of landmarks and secrets, and I didn't find even one of them to be a disappointment. There's always something for your time, which caters very nicely to treasure hunters like me.\n\nI don't really like giving ratings out of ten, but maybe I can give WoL a letter grade. It feels like an A to me- missing the mark of an A+ due almost entirely due to how rudimentary the combat can be. Maybe the upcoming DLC can add enough content to gloss over that- or if we're really lucky, improve it.

In contrast with its predecessor, West of Loathing immerses you in a kinda-sorta-real (but definitely, definitely not real at all) wild west environment that is loaded with lore and references from its namesake, including food related magic, goblins with terrible grammar, and various other callbacks to KoL.\n\nThe Good:\n-Excellent writing, on just about every level. West of Loathing will probably make you laugh (to tears, if you're like me) while its vivid descriptions of various happenstance apart from comedy will make you feel all sorts of things from disgust, to fear, to incredulity. \n-Easy to understand combat. An RPG though it may be, West of Loathing has at least part of a dedication to accessibility, and accomodates players of all levels. It will challenge you and punish you, but never terribly or unfairly. More over, some well placed buff stacking can often help you overcome challenges, just like in KoL. \n-Much like a classic adventure game, West of Loathing give you a great deal of freedom to do whatever you like in whatever order you'd like to do it. The way you're dropped into the world and made to \"figure it out\" makes for a compelling, organic experience.\n-Stupid Walking.\n\nThe Less Good:\n-Game lacks a truly effective quest log. It's not that I don't necessarily respect the decision to not include it, but the rate at which you can become bogged down with things to do, especially in a text based game, can become quite staggering. Without a better quest log, it gets a little mind boggling.\n-The same sort of organic and non-linear gameplay used in WoL can sometimes cause you to miss out on content without ever realizing it, or locking yourself out of certain things without knowing it. (I like this about the game, personally, but I could see why others wouldn't.)\n\nAltogether, this is a very good, and surprisingly large RPG.

I'd would have vastly preferred one of the following implementations:\n\nKeep hard hat in\n* Allow you to put the hard hat on at character creation.\n* Tweak quests that require you to be wearing certain hats to be completed with hard hat on. If these quests were dropped for their bonuses being two strong then tweak the reward appropriately.\n\nRemove hard hat\n* Provide a difficulty selector at character creation and remove the hard hat from the game. The loss of the hat item slot is not a significant enough loss of stats to make a difference through the majority of the game.\n\nI changed my review and I think this game is worth a pickup to anyone who enjoys a funny lightweight RPG and highly recommend you only play through with hard hat on.

It's not some off-the-rack Newgrounds Flash game. I promise.\n\nWest of Loathing is a lot of things. I guess you could consider it what you'd get if Monkey Island and Paper Mario got smashed together? Yeah, \"an adventure game with RPG elements\" is good to go with. It's also loaded with A+ humor. If anything, you gotta check the game out just for a good laugh.\n\nCharacter creation allows for a lot of customization: You have three character classes to choose from, as well as four horses (three of which give unique gameplay perks) and a list of companions that each have their own skillsets, story relevance, and dialogue additions. You spend experience points to upgrade your stats and skills as you see fit, and there are a number of story events that also shape how your character plays and what options are available to them further along in the game.\n\nMost of the game plays like a big adventure game puzzle. You'll build up a large inventory of items as you play, and a lot of those items can be used to solve puzzles or bypass obstacles. There's also pretty much always more than one way to resolve any confrontation or obstacle. In fact, you can even play through the entire game without getting into a single fight! Items, skills, partners, horses, and previously completed objectives can all allow you to skip fights, and while there are a couple unavoidable fights in the game, they're all in highly optional sidequests. Most of the fun in the game comes from figuring out how to avoid some of these combats!\n\nThe combat system is pretty simple, and is honestly the game's only true weak point. It can be fun if you find yourself in just the right encounter, but most of your fights will fall into exactly one of two categories: \"I can kill this single enemy with one attack\" or \"this swarm of enemies will tear me apart.\"\n\nThere also puzzles. Like, a TON of them. And they're all unique. Some are easy. Some are hard. Some require outside sources to solve. If you're a puzzle nut, you'll REALLY get into some of the really deep puzzles and mysteries buried in the game.\n\nAll in all, this is a really high-quality game. There's just SO MUCH content in here, and while you CAN focus on the main objective and finish the game in a handful of hours, there's just so much side stuff to do that you can easily drop several dozen hours on a single playthrough. And even then, there's so many things that really make each playthrough different that you can play again and again and have different experiences. I can't recommend this game enough: Check it out!", "timestamp_created": 1503252661, "timestamp_updated": 1503252661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

And this isn't a bad thing at all; the amount of depth and choice you're given in this game, sometimes even for the simple reward of more dialogue, is highly enoyable and I find this an incredibly easy game to recommend. I didn't know about Kingdom of Loathing prior to this game, so rest assured you don't need to have any knowledge of it prior to this game. I'm not sure how to keep going so I'll just do a pros and cons list.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Writing; it's humorous but provides a lot of depth to the world. Actions feel like they all have consequences and ignoring major sidequests can and will affect your ending. I loved going around to every little object just to read the text.\n\n- Music: There aren't too too many tracks but I never got tired of them. I'll probably buy the soundtrack now that it's available, it's very enjoyable.\n\n- Gameplay: It's simple buy fun and easy to understand. You have three base classes that determine you're main skills, and from there you're free to screw up your character as you wish. The game also has autolevels if you find that intimidating. I plan to do more playthroughs to experience other classes.\n\n- Graphics: Yes, they're simple and resemble a newgrounds title, but I like it and think they work quite well. Every hat and weapon appears and your character which is cute.\n- PRICE: This game is CHEAP. One playthrough took me about 9 hours and I plan on playing more. I would pay more for this game.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- No real way to work with saves: the game basically runs on autosaves which I like, but if you mess up you can't turn back. I believe this is intentional, but I do wish it was slightly more forgiving for when you make mistakes in the beginning (such as putting on the hard mode hat, without any prior knowledge of the games difficulty)\n\n- UI: The UI works for the most part, but there's some clunkiness to it. You can't tell what items have an interaction without clicking on them in your invetory and that fills up fast. I like the silly names of items, but organizing them can be a drag. Like for example, I may be looking for a quest item, but I don't know what category of item it would possibly be, and the name of the item might be like \"that darn cryptic message,\" when my brain is thinking \"I'm looking for that note that I picked up earlier\". The game does attempt to provide some rudimentary ways to organize your inventory which work slightly but I definitely had some headaches looking for items. Icons for the organization aren't always clear what is what. (I know some have mentioned the lack of a quest log, but I don't mind your partner filling that role, personally)\n\n- Graphics: I know I praised the graphics earlier, but the style does lend itself to some problems in the busier environments of the game (like Buffalo Hill). It can occasionally be hard to tell what you can interact with.\n\n- Accessibility: I didn't see a controller option for this game, but I feel it could easily work with one. Controllers tire out my hands less, so I hope in the future this is included.", "timestamp_created": 1503211857, "timestamp_updated": 1503211906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34366885": {"recommendationid": "34366885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188110007", "num_games_owned": 417, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503210074}, "language": "english", "review": "Stupid Walking was a skill that helped me cartwheel my way throughout the Old West with my faithful companion Pete. \n\nAlong the way, I punched cows, fought resurrected skeletons, drank sssaparillallaila (however the heck you spell it), destroyed necromancers, ate ghost pickles, and got an ant-eye virus from the evil villain, Norton. \n\nAlso, best stick graphics around. \n\n10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1503211513, "timestamp_updated": 1503211513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495713", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34366857": {"recommendationid": "34366857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062657170", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504481862}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is designed simply, and yet it never seems dull or boring.

The animation may be simplistic, but the game is dripping with jokes, thematic glee and puns. The game auto-saves -- no loading and going back if you make a decision you don't like -- but the game moves very fast when you want it to.\n\nBiggest pros:\n1: Character is HIGHLY customizable. If you turn off auto-spending of EXP, you can level up any aspect you wish, Final Fantasy 2 style. Level individual stats, or raise your favorite skill up way early. You can't \"ruin\" your character and the cost to raise the neglected stats does NOT go up from leveling other things. The leveling system is wonderfully made, for finicky people like me.\n2: Grinding is easy and non-mandatory. You can progress through the plot quickly if you desire, or wander aimlessly and grind, loot, and explore. Plenty of side places to visit with funny side quests, and a \"Wander\" button that basically means \"feed me a random fight or loot please\". I love it.\n3: Grinding applicable to your class is available. Various areas have \"spawners\". If you see it say \"Bigger fight\" in the menu, that's a \"start group battle\" button. From spawning Skeletons to level your doctor friend, or spawning cow-monoliths to level your gunslinger friend, if you need a particular type of resource, chances are there's somewhere to farm it.\n\nNote for the Developer: I watched Markiplier play this game. That is what convinced me to buy it. Just so you know, his play videos brought me to your game and gave you my business.

Maybe not. Would it be crackers? Something tacky? Maybe a thick chop of beef, smothered in hog oil and ranch dressing...wait what? That doesn't sound right. A meal of that magnitude requires more beef tongue, perhaps washed down in military-grade whiskey with a gin blossom chaser. If not, then a steaming hot pizza freshly plucked from the nearby grave, followed by some fine wine paired with gummy guns and a bit of ectoplasm from the ghost you had to kill at said grave because you stole his pizza.

There before you, lies something even greater than anything you've ever thought of. Slowly, in awe and in reverence, you open the packet before you and take it to your stove.

This isn\u2019t terribly unusual on its own. I started playing a LOT of games in 2004. What is terribly unusual about Kingdom of Loathing is that 13 years later, it still matters. I didn\u2019t really start playing a game, I joined a community.\n\nThat sounds ridiculous (it\u2019s not even funny!), but in a month I\u2019m flying across the country to spend four days in a house with 17 people I only know because of this game. We\u2019re going to hang out together, then go home. And we\u2019ll do it again next year. I\u2019m doing this instead of going to GenCon, so you can get a feeling of where this falls on a scale of \u2018things Arsh wants to do with his time and money\u2019.\n\nSo maybe that makes me the wrong person to be objective about Asymmetric\u2019s new game West of Loathing. Or maybe it makes me the right person?\n\nI've known about West of Loathing for forever, and I finally got to play it at PAX East this spring. I was actually surprised it wasn't more KoL-like, but was an actual walk around point and click style game with JRPG combat.It looked good, was funny, controls were tight, and the animation was excellent. I played it for maybe 10 or 15 minutes and then had to get to work, and didn't think much about it for a while.\n\nBut then, it got released. I\u2019d been hearing DanBob talk about it constantly, and I really wanted to play it. So when it released, I bought it at work, told Steam to install it remotely, and got home that night and played for a couple of hours.\n\nIt grabbed me. It\u2019s hilarious. It\u2019s fun. It rewards exploration. Combat is tight, fast, and deadly. It\u2019s got snakes. It\u2019s got bandits. It\u2019s got the Undead. It\u2019s got clowns. It\u2019s got a Necromancer. It\u2019s got ghosts. It\u2019s got alien technology. It\u2019s got spittoons.\n\nIt has Stupid Walking.\n\nI don\u2019t really want to say too much. I don\u2019t want to spoil any of the humor. You could decide you\u2019ll wait for a Steam Sale and grab it for $5. To be totally honest, that\u2019s likely what I would do with most new games. But if you buy it now, you won\u2019t regret it.\n\nGo get this game.", "timestamp_created": 1503086062, "timestamp_updated": 1503088286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34334179": {"recommendationid": "34334179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063265050", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503237353}, "language": "english", "review": "Quality humour.

West of Loathing is a demonstration of the errors of this kind of thinking. Don't get me wrong, shiny graphics and voice acting are both nice elements that can greatly benefit immersion in a game. Every game benefits from looking and sounding as good as possible but those things are not the main appeal of RPGs specifically. So here we have West of Loathing, a game devoid of the trappings of modern AAA RPG's. It is in fact composed of black and white stick figures who's funny dialoge is not voiced and is acompanied by music which definitely sets the mood but is hardly inspiring. Yet the game is compelling because it has it's focus on the elements that form the basic appeal of an RPG. It has a simple, yet satisfying system for bulding your characters. The addition of cool perks and skills that can be found in the world is increadibly important to the game's appeal. Unlike many other games West of Loathing isn't affraid to let you miss things which makes finding things all the sweeter, especially when an item or abillity or perk found in some random cave might unlock a new way of completing some quest. Yes, problems have multiple solutions. This is a game where choices matter. No longer is the player stuck with the ''choice'' of agreeing to do something in three mildly different ways. I should also note that West of Loathing is a comedy game. The humor hasn't exactly captivated me thus far but frankly I don't care.

Also, with DLC now starting pre-production as discussed on their podcasts, that's an issue readily fixed.\n\nThe El Vib content feels forced, in desperate need of extra content like mini-bosses or landmarks more significant than just learning the languages, and memerizing all the station locations is like, emulating the third or forth worst thing about moving house in the dead of summer - where did you put everything useful, and why is it so irritating to dig through places to try and remember. \n\nThe final big problem is not that the combat is broken - not strictly anyway - but that it is qute easy the moment you complete a little side content for stats or items, and lacks some of the hallmarks of a good western RPG: Actually challenging fights. Not all of them need to be tricky and hard, but the game is crying out for more special mechanics to add a bit of spice, and it's also crying out for more combat encounters like some of their other games (Namely Kingdom of Loathing) that feature big content zones focused around challenging and tricky combats, like Hobopolis or Dreadsylvania. Essentially, it lacks those fights like in Skyrim such as The Ebon Warrior or some of the optional dragon priests - The sort of fights that kick your ass with raw stats with a dash of counterplay that give big rewards like new items, or new subzones. I think this leads to the only neutral point in this review: The game really does feel like you're able to wander in almost anywhere, other than the gating of moving the train forward.

The game knows when to be funny and when not to be. And while toilet-humor abounds (both literally and figuratively), the jokes are never truly idiotic, nor meanspirited. \n\n2) Freedom of choice. Do you want to solve the puzzle or bypass it entirely? Do you want to engage in every subquest or barrel through to the ending? Do you want to kill every enemy you see or attempt a pacifist run? Anything is possible, although certain choices do have meaningful consequences. Different kinds of people will enjoy the game in many different ways and on many different levels.\n\n3) Charming music, art and animation. And there's a continual stream of new stuff to see from beginning to end.\n\n4) Cheap price. There's at least $20 worth of content in here.\n\n5) Trustworthy developers. This is a small indie company with ~15 years of experience that actively engages with their playerbase. They want to generate DLC and make new games.

Tired of deciding whether to hoard your potions or heal up before a big fight? You start every combat with full HP and MP (the game calls them action points). Don't like wandering a zone to wait for random encounters to strike so you can grind up?

If you're on the fence about either of those things, there's still a lot here to like.\n\nFor a parody western based on a parody fantasy turn-based, tick-based, pun-based MMO, West of Loathing is a startlingly good. It's not just satisfying as an RPG, it's wonderfully written, cleverly designed, and a really satisfying counterpart to its MMO source game. Referential humor, absurdism, and a weirdly deep understanding of both what makes a good western *and* the real-world history of the California area at the time are all on display here, and those are great on their own, but WoL is also not afraid to delve into some fairly strong horror and some of its puzzles and subplot threads are so convoluted that the community is still exploring it for bits of hidden content.\n\nPrior knowledge of the MMO is not required to play (and thank goodness, because playing through the MMO is something of a chore), but its lore *does* enrich WoL in a big way. In fact, WoL is a much less silly story than KoL, and it's got quite a bit of actual pathos.\n\nI've found myself caring about the characters that I meet in a way that simply does not happen in most parody games, and I'd recommend WoL on the strength of that alone.\n\nBUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE\n\nThree detailed classes, each with unique playstyles and ways of interacting with the world. \n\nA whole host of unlockable and levelable skills, hidden perks, item-based abilities, and other crunchy, mechanical goodness that influences both combat, conversations, and interactive points on the map.\n\nTactical combat against a wide range of foes. While not very mechanically satisfying, it doesn't drag and it's usually backed by good writing at both ends.\n\nA fairly massive world map, utterly crammed with fully explorable locations. It feels and looks like a Fallout-style world map, but what really stands out is the sheer diversity of random encounters that have been coded into the game. I've seen the same combat twice...a couple of times. And there's a short random encounter almost every time you take a trip.\n\nBasically, this game is a labor of love.\n\nIf you don't like doing a lot of reading, if you dislike RPGs, or if you have a burning need to be a completionist, this might not be the best experience for you.

Even if I don't/can't understand 95% of the jokes and have never played Kingdom of Loathing, (it's prequal/spinoff/whatever), it was still a good RPG on it's own. It has puzzles, some of which are the standard simple RPG fare, and some of which require a lot more time, effort, and brainpower to figure out. It has a story that makes sense in the world of the game, and for the most part, what you need to do to progress is fairly simple.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nThis is a standard turn based RPG and the combat system doesn't do anything new. Not that it needs to. If you've ever played any turn based RPG you'll recognise this system. Combat is very simple. The characters with the highest speed stat go first, basic attacks are free, and the rest of your skills require action points, of which you have a limited number per fight, and action points reset every fight. \n\nInteracting with things is easy and basically involves running up to whatever object you want to interact with and press 'e'. Sometimes you might need to go into your inventory and use an object. The actual interaction part is very easy. The actual steps you might need to take to complete some quests in a certain way is more difficult, but that's part of the fun.\n\nChoices exist. There are multiple ways to finish quests, multiple ways to build a character (even if it's the same class), and many other choices besides. The game is directly influenced by how you do quests and which people you help. It is entirely possible to be locked out of some choices/quests if you kill everyone you see as a potential threat immediately. It is also possible and likely that you'll wind up selling off a load of junk and someone will ask for some of it later (not that you can't get more of it, but still.)\n\n[b]What this game is not:[/b]\nAn exploration game where you go out into a monochrome 2d world and find things. There are set locations on your map, you go there and that area is rendered for you. There are random events as you travel between locations, but they don't have an actual area for your character to walk around in and find secret passages or anything. There are 'secrets' but they are usually fairly obvious from a visual standpoint, even if your character doesn't immediately have the skills needed to get into that area.\n\nForgiving in terms of optional puzzles. You can complete the main game and most quest chains in towns no matter what. You may not do it as cleanly or optimally as you'd like, but you can do it. It is, however, very possible to screw up several puzzles or very off-the track side quests (either by doing the puzzles incorrectly or by killing people you need), in such a way that you can't complete the puzzle or can't get the best ending for a quest. For example, minor spoiler in the first half hour [spoiler]The goblin that the bartender in the prologue asks you to kill can be a companion... as long as you don't kill him and actually manage to find out how to communicate with him, which most people aren't likely to do on their first try/playthrough[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1502845233, "timestamp_updated": 1502845233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34267024": {"recommendationid": "34267024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105497820", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504145523}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent writing, hilarious references (many of which I don't get but it's still great)", "timestamp_created": 1502845053, "timestamp_updated": 1502845053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34266892": {"recommendationid": "34266892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067055668", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503958125}, "language": "english", "review": "On the surface, this may look like your general steam trash. \"What is this stick figure crap?\" you may ask.

Every joke is a strong 8/10 that surprises you just enough to get a chuckle, but this is where the importance of that sort of implementation of humor comes in. \n\nThere are a lot of jokes. A lot. \n\nAs in, every item description. Every skill description. Almost every interactable, and the game has a bunch of those. \n\nEvery conversation is dripping with humorous dialogue, often jumping in an even rhythm between droll observations and wordplay (\"Your horses are flying out the door? I'm glad business is going well!\", to which someone responds, \"No, like they're running out of the door every day. I haven't had a sale in weeks.\"), to sudden backwards steps in logic that force anywhere between a chuckle and a guffaw of laughter out of you based upon how surprised you are (That same man then gives you a bag of homing oats to feed his horses, which are special pigeon-infused oats that will compel them to go home). \n\nThe combat's a bit eeeeehhhhhh but it's very inoffensive at worst, and it's quick and very rarely difficult at all. It's meant to be there to facilitate gameplay, not waste your time. A lot of the animations are absolute gold as well - the Rattlesnake in Thousand Snakes Gulch, instead of slithering, bounces up and down like a pogo stick on its way to attack you. \n\nPlus, dude, there's this skill called Stupid Walking, and it just replaces your walk cycle with one of a dozen different animations that range from swimming on the ground, to step-dancing, to tucking yourself into a ball and rolling across the ground. Each one of those animations even has its own sound effects, because the joke works so much better when you hear the translation from face-sliding to Frankenstein-walking happen. \n\nKoL has an absolutely charming and timeless style of humor that applies to pretty much everyone, and the same is true of WoL. However, this humor all belies something else as well: \n\nWest of Loathing is a fantastic point n' click style, \"Items are your friends and the only way to solve this quest chain\" adventure game as well. Almost every quest has either multiple solutions or hidden paths involved; half of the best loot and skills in the game come from interacting with the environment, not leveling up or solving a quest chain. \n\nIn the first area alone, you can miss two party members, four pretty decent items, three horses, three snake skins, a magic ring, and a turnip by either taking hasty solutions to problems or skipping environmental interaction. This game wants you to do everything, and is very open to the notion that you in-fact should if you want the full experience. \n\nThe game doesn't punish you for playing like a jackass, and it doesn't rely upon specific builds or character classes to engage in a lot of the environmental gameplay (The Foragin', Dickerin', and Lockpickin' skills, each of which open up specific environmental interactions and dialogue choices, are chosen outside of your class). \n\nIt's a fun, open game that doesn't lose its charm no matter how much of it you play. It's not Skyrim, it won't go on for 400 hours of mildly-satisfying gameplay - but the 60 or so hours you can get out of it, you'll probably enjoy a lot more. \n\nSo yeah, West of Loathing. I strongly endorse it.

But honestly, it's found a tone and stuck to it and I don't suspect it will change very much so I feel comfortable writing this. [/i]\n\nSo, about 1000 internet years ago, a browser game called Kingdom of Loathing happened. Basically, it was the game I'd probably come up with if you told me to make an RPG - a big vehicle to house billions of stupid puns and goofs, without nearly as much thought given to gameplay or art or etc.\n\nWest of Loathing is basically the same thing.\n\nYou'll probably start off looking at the store page, and assume that it's gotten mostly positive reviews as a joke. The screenshots make it look rudimentary in design and visual style. And, certainly, this game takes a certain kind of person to really enjoy. If, for example, you can't derive massive amounts of enjoyment from the fact that Necromancy is referred to in-game as \"Nex-Mex\", this probably isn't your bag.\n\nMe? I chuckled again just THINKING about that. So, you probably know by now I'm going to recommend this.\n\nBut here's the gist of the game anyway. It's a wild-west RPG that works ideas from the American Southwest into the framework of a more traditional turn-based game. It actually reminds me a bit of Fallout in terms of its execution - heavily skills and consumables-focused. It's surprisingly deep for a game that's effectively a joke storage facility. I recommend speeding up the combat (there's an option for it), because the animations do get tiresome.\n\nThere is a suprisingly large amount of content in the game - I'd estimate at least 10 hours' worth based on my current progress. I wouldn't be shocked if this game features the largest number of jokes in a game to date, and somehow most of them land. The visual style is much more richly detailed than it first appears - everything is crudely hand-drawn, but the environments have layers, and the game actually looks pretty good.\n\nThe sound design is similarly surprisingly good. I was shocked to find this game has directional audio AT ALL - yet it does.\n\nOverall, West of Loathing is full of little surprises. For $11 (clever in-joke there), you really can't go wrong. It's a solid 10+ hours of amusing quests.\n\nAnd also I fed my horse spooky oats, for she is a ghost, and ghosts only eat spooky food.", "timestamp_created": 1502810416, "timestamp_updated": 1502810526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34257420": {"recommendationid": "34257420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322342264", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502631263}, "language": "english", "review": "> made my character \n> played a bit\n> laughed so hard\n> quite game\n> wrote this review \n> DIED!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath cause : over laughing .....", "timestamp_created": 1502808696, "timestamp_updated": 1502808696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34257331": {"recommendationid": "34257331", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998994584", "num_games_owned": 351, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 457, "last_played": 1514637906}, "language": "english", "review": "i love this game\n\nwarning for jews and muslims and other vegans: the currency is bacon", "timestamp_created": 1502808362, "timestamp_updated": 1502808362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480883", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34256375": {"recommendationid": "34256375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321585214", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503131208}, "language": "english", "review": "A very good game and its an rpg i have never seen before BUUUUUUT i find it impossible to finish the mayor of breadwood's quests", "timestamp_created": 1502804954, "timestamp_updated": 1502804954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34255133": {"recommendationid": "34255133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027166852", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504096693}, "language": "english", "review": "The humour I expected from KoL creators is there in full force.

Include monster books for monster identification, hidden collectibles, and a journal system.\n3) When wandering, possibly include random events that allow you to explore some of the landscape outside of the regular visitable locations.\n\nThose are just a few suggestions!

Thankfully this has the consistency, variety and taste to continuinally feel densely and refreshingly entertaining (or, occasionally, revoltingly horrifying). Some quests have alternate, usually funnier ways to solve them beyond \"just kill everyone\", there's skill checks and stats and weird abilities, there's rpg combat and puzzles, yet ultimately that's all more intended to be cohesive glue and base for the humor instead of challenging roadblocks or deep systems to theorycraft around. It's \"just\" serviceable, by design. Luckily the thing it serves is one of my favorite experiences this year.\n\nA lot of the qualities of this come from its writing, so if you enjoy formats like ClickVentures you'll feel right at home. If you can't or don't like reading you probably won't even have made it this far into my review so hi cool readers, let's all laugh at those lazy goblins together, high five!\n\nAnyway, would i recommend this game for 10 bucks?

The writing is great, the quests are fulfilling, the puzzles are enjoyable without being frustrating, and the plot is well-developed (though, yes, rather weird). The art and animation style is also of higher quality than I expected from the screenshots. The lighting in caves, for example, is particularly cool and adds a bit of clever realism. There are plenty of non-obvious things to interact with and enjoy. I found that I never tire of finding another little clever addition to the game.\n\nOne thing: You have to enjoy (or at least feel comfortable with) reading a lot of text. So much of the richness of the game comes down to if the player is paying attention to the dialog and descriptions. If you don't actively read or if you just skim, you can miss important hints for quests and jokes that might be built upon later.\n\nThere are a few significant references here and there to jokes you find in KoL (for example, certain numbers are often used) which made me feel connected to this game in a way I may not otherwise have been had I not been such a devout KoL player from 2004-2010. I'd expect that someone unfamiliar with KoL would not notice nor be any worse off, however.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that I really really want to be able to change how the keyboard controls are set up. I do not find it possible (or comfortable) to use only the keyboard, which I would much prefer.\n\nOverall, this game is entertaining as hell and I find myself literally laughing aloud. I think it does a great job of capturing and keeping the interest of the player. The price is quite reasonable and it surpassed all my expectations.

I am starting a second playthrough at time of this review knowing that I have a lot to look at, both for laughs and for content. The player's options are defined from the beginning in certain regards- even the prologue should be carefully weighed for a variety of choices, as some paths may be closed off to to the less observant player from the outset if they are not careful.\n\nOverall, if you have a clue as to what Asymmetric is about and you liked what you saw, I'd have to heartily recommend this game. Even if you aren't familiar I'd recommend at the very least looking at the trailers or gameplay footage online to see if it might be for you.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1502590765, "timestamp_updated": 1502590765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34203871": {"recommendationid": "34203871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321787881", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511582653}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like KoL, it's an automatic buy.

Is that weird to say about a game? It's just lovely. Everything about Loathing is completely charming! \n\nI was a beanwizard cowpoke travelling with a world-weary whiskey-swilling sawbones who had a vendetta against skeletons. Riding together on my pale horse (an actual spooky ghost) we set off to rid the world of a dread necromancer and also uncover the mysteries of an ancient alien civilization lurking in the deepest parts of the frontier.  But that's just another day in the wild west.\n\nWest of Loathing is a comedic RPG that starts cracking jokes right from character creation and never lets up. It riffs on its weird west fantasy setting relentlessly, presenting you with beanslinging wizards alongside guntotin' outlaws. It's absolutely dense with jokes, puns, and clever writing.\n\nThat's not to say that it's a joke game: as an RPG, it's robust in terms of character development and player choice, especially if you elect to manually spend XP. Nearly every situation has multiple dialogue choices and solutions based on your character stats, skills, and items at hand, and two players might have wildly differing experiences as a result. It draws inspiration from 90's cRPG design, yet Loathing feels inviting and approachable to nearly anyone. The turn-based combat is not terribly challenging outside of a few key fights, but feels meaty enough as connective tissue in between exploration and walking up to every object to read new jokes. (There is a hard mode, but I haven't tried it.)\n\nIt's so easy to write off a game like this based on looks alone. \"Stick-figure RPG\" conjures images of amateurish flash games from the early 2000's, but Loathing is anything but amateurish. The hand-drawn art is joyous, not crude, and communicates so much character, especially in motion. About ten seconds into the game you can unlock a menu option that makes you walk silly. This would've been a one-off joke except they crammed in about two dozen incredibly silly walk cycles (including context-sensitive ones!) that I kept it on the whole game, just admiring the sheer goofmanship involved.\n\nMy initial playthrough clocked in at about 9 hours, with most (but not all!) of the side content completed, and I'm already starting another character to see the things I missed. Side quests are at the heart of Loathing. The game world branches out in scope like a Bethesda game might. The main quest is fairly barebones, serving to gate the three sections of the overworld, and making a beeline for it would lead you to miss so much of the clever writing and wonderful characters that make the game worthwhile.\n\nBesides the standard combat scenarios, there's also some surprisingly cerebral puzzles: these are going to be hit or miss depending on the player, but be prepared to take notes on some of the more fiendish ones. Or, being side content, they are entirely skippable if you'd rather not engage with them.\n\nOverall, West of Loathing is a very funny game with solid RPG bones that has both depth and accessibility. The combat may be the weaker part of the game, but is perfectly serviceable and resolves quickly. Branching choices and hidden content mean that there's a good amount of replay value too.\n\nI don't think a minute passed without Loathing putting at least a smile on my face, never mind all the genuine laughs I had. West of Loathing is a real gem, relentlessly goofy yet clever, and always ready to charm.

It's probably obvious at first glance that [i]West of Loathing[/i] is comedy\u2014and it is, indeed, absolutely hilarious. It's worth picking up just for the tone, ridiculous items, ability to do bean magic, choose to ride a crazy horse for the 'insensitive' achievement, explore the depths of spitoons (it's just as bad as it sounds, so WoL doubles as a horror game), receive XP-charged air from you brother, get a separate perk for hurting yourself on cacti too many times... and, most luxuriously of all, change the game's font to Arial.\n\nHowever, what is less obvious is how good of an RPG WoL actually is. It's not very challenging\u2014but it adheres to the idea that an RPG game is first and foremost about finding different approaches to various problems, not just fighting monsters. So you can, for example, make it harder... you just need to [i]find[/i] the item that adds challenge first. Want to make a good fortune in the West? Good luck with that\u2014you'll have to really honestly [i]search[/i] for it, no hand-holding. Seems like something is stirring, and those are the bones of dead people? Once again, it's up to you to look for the Necromancer raising them. Or not.\n\nFor a 2D black-and-while stick-figure parody WoL is surprisingly open-ended. It has cryptography puzzles to be solved and musicians to be found in unexpected places. Most important conundrums can be approached in a number of ways, while others become secrets for you to unveil over the course of the playthrough... or several ones?\n\nSo yes, [i]West of Loathing[/i] is a perfect blend of adventure and RPG, that feels robust despite being limited in scope.

As an RPG, the three main classes and skilll systems seem really expansive but not overwhelming, and has a simple turn based combat engine (with layers of mechanics like elements, close and long ranged weapons, skills, etc.) So far, combat hasn't felt repetitive or needlessly aimed at making you grind - and the challenge can be amped up early in the game, if you're up for it. \nThe highly entertaining written narrative and dialogue, fused with the simple quirky art design, creates an experience that is memorable and stands out compared to so many games available these days. Stick figures in hats dancing and drinking couldn't look better. Everything seems assembled with care and placed into the game with love, and the details don't distract you.\n\nI implore you to check this out if you:\nAre a fan of classic RPG adventures.\nCan appreciate aesthetics and graphics in a game besides what you'd normally see in cinematic heavy AAA titles.\nEnjoy a game with clever writing (not just notes scattered about for narrative purposes)\nWant to save the West from the ever rising cow-demon threat.\n\nWhat can I say - if you know anything about Kingdom of Loathing, you'll enjoy this game. \nWhether your KoL experiences were a brief time playing with it years ago, playing on and off like myself for 10+ years, or being a complete veteran or noob to Asymmetric's unassuming yet highly engaging and deep browser game, West of Loathing draws on KoL's charm and strengths and is amplified in a special way as a standalone experience.", "timestamp_created": 1502461032, "timestamp_updated": 1502473093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34169332": {"recommendationid": "34169332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033980818", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504868330}, "language": "english", "review": "what is going on in this game legit", "timestamp_created": 1502460757, "timestamp_updated": 1502460757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34169293": {"recommendationid": "34169293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035538441", "num_games_owned": 497, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503251302}, "language": "english", "review": "Been playing KOL for about 11 years, as a long time seal clubber I naturally started as a sealclubber.

In terms of basic structure it's similar to most RPGs where you have a main quest and sidequests that you're going on and along the way you're collecting stats, new equiptment, meeting NPCs, visiting towns, etc. \n\n[h1]First the Pros[/h1]\nThe best part of the game is definitely the creativity, humor and sense of discovery -- because of the simplicity of the graphics and just the style of the game, it allows for a lot more varied combinations of stuff and situations. Unlike most RPGs, it doesn't really have a part where you're just grinding away mindlessly; the story's constantly moving forward and there's constantly new locations to be discovered (that's the beauty of simple graphics!).\n\nAlso, don't let the stick figures fool you -- this is a very thought out and carefully made game. It's well-balanced in terms of item drops, difficulty progression, fun plotlines and stories, variations to enhance replayability, etc. Each aspect of it feels very intentional. For item drops, for example, I find that in a lot of RPGs it's either too flukey in terms of getting good items (to the point where there's too muck luck involved) or more frequently most of the junk you collect doesn't matter except after a boss battle. This game is not like that at all, you're constantly getting different stuff in the way thay makes sense. There's no part of it that feels like an afterthought.\n\nPlus, people familiar with the genre will notice that they've taken the time to consider the little things to take annoyances out of the game -- there's no inventory management (unlimited inventory) and you don't spend time trudging around (you can always go straight back the main map and there's no long stretches of walking -- I personally hate watching my character walk around in games so I love when developers have taken that into consideration). I love, love, love that you can speed up the combat animation to 300% under the options. I love games that don't waste my time.\n\nThis game looks casual, but there's so many decisions in the design of it that were clearly very intentional and thoughtful.\n\n[h1]A Few (Negligible) Cons[/h1]\nThe only downside I could find was that there's so much going on especially once you get further into the game - locations, quests, things to go back to - that it's a little hard to keep track of. I hardly think that's a big knock against this. Beyond that, it's up to you to decide if you're OK with the graphics -- I loved Kingdom of Loathing back in the day so I knew what I was getting into. \n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nFor most seasoned RPG players, this game won't be too difficult. As long as you're careful, you can avoid a lot of the stuff that'll kill you outright, plus there's no permadeath (you just wake up and it's a new day) so you might get slowed down but it's not going to feel like you can't progress. It's heavy on puzzles which, depending on what you're into, may be a plus or minus for you. \n\nThat said, there's also a hidden Hardcore Mode ([spoiler]it's a hat, actually, and you can find it during the prologue, but it affects a lot more than just what you can wear on your head[/spoiler]) where the game gets significantly more difficult in terms of combat. As far as I could tell, the puzzles stay the same. So, if you're not into the puzzles and want a harder game, you can always find a walkthrough to get the answers to the puzzles and do it that way. \n\nMy recommendation would be to play through normally the first time and once you've figured out the puzzles, then try it again on hardcore. \n\n[h1]Replayability[/h1]\nYou will definitely want to replay the game at least once. There's multiple ways to solve a bulk of the interactions (largely depending on what type of character you are), plus there's different mounts you can ride with different attributes (standard, sneaky, spooky and crazy), and three different companions -- so you'll be rewarded by playing through it again with a pretty varied experience.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nHonestly, this is one of the better games I've played in a while, It's very well balanced and fun.

I was going to buy it either way, but given the state of Kingdom of Loathing in recent years I can't help but feel that Asymmetric have started to lose their touch with that game; from disbanding one of their lead writers (for a game that rides almost entirely on its writing) to revamping a quest that used to parody \"collect all two dozen manual pages\" into a quest where you ACTUALLY collect all two dozen manual pages... it's not the breath of fresh air it once was.\n\nI'm happy to say that, in spite of or perhaps because of this, West of Loathing has been a pleasant surprise. I now wonder if part of the reason KoL has been on the wane is because they were pouring their best efforts into this instead. I've laughed more at the first half hour of this than I have at KoL in [i]years[/i] now, and the RPG-lite mechanics and combat system are done in a novel and compelling way (although the writing is still what you'll be playing for).\n\nMy primary gripes are that playing a completely black-and-white game for an extended period is slightly murderous on the eyes, and that it only seems to support a single save file... which is ludicrous given there's a fair number of things that you can permanently miss on one playthrough, and there are 3 character classes to play as. I'm also not convinced that there's actually enough depth to the game to give it much replayability, but at any rate I'm having fun so far.", "timestamp_created": 1502436097, "timestamp_updated": 1502436437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34162546": {"recommendationid": "34162546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019873811", "num_games_owned": 418, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510711209}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a fan of KoL for a long time, despite having kept up with the game. Having a fresh experience, new story and setting, and completely revamped gameplay is such a great shot in the arm of the company, it's reminded me within the first few minutes of gameplay why I fell in love with it in the first place. It's sharp writing, unique humor that hits multiple angles, and strong RPG and exploration gameplay make it a fun solo experience that makes it a fun RPG. Its RPG challenge and wide selection of pop culture targets make it so expansive that it may not welcome newcomers to the RPG genre itself, and don't expect to catch every reference on the first reading as some of them are so subtly written as such to avoid overselling a joke.\n\nIf you aren't familiar with the MMO, basically KoL game is a text-based MMO with stick figure graphics. This game removes the MMO aspect, adding complete animations and character control to the experience, which makes exploration so much fun. Just like the original, each area is themed, and if you think you know what the joke is at the end, you are generally thrown off by a complete change of direction. How advant-garde! Seriously, where else are you going to find a game that references the Foo Fighters AND X-files in a single room, keeps it thematically appropriate, maintains the suspension of disbelief by keeping it within the realm of possibility of the world, tells a completely original joke that's only amplified by the understanding of the reference, AND continues to build its world and challengingly strategic RPG gameplay all in one? They never hesitate to waste a reference: the tooltips for the graphics options are Good, Bad, and Ugly. There's a ton of hidden gags that are too numerous to be called \"easter eggs\" that reward any and all exploration.\n\nThe game is challenging yet approachable. In accordance to old school RPG rules, you never really know the difficulty of an enemy until you engage it. This makes the beginning area extremely annoying once you open the map up, as you don't know whether an area can net you some good experience or have you face off enemies that can one shot you down. There's plenty of opportunity for leveling given that your stats are based on the XP earned rather than an arbitrary level threshold, and there's a lot of depth to gain from the choices you make. Fans of stat-building, and hardcore buff enthusiasts will feel right at home trying to min-max their stats for the most benefit using the spleen/liver effect system to potion or drink yourself to perfection.

There was the 'two bit w h o r e', which literally cost 2 cents, to the expensive 'parlor w h o r e'. \n\nI am also very taken back that in today's progressive culture, where there are individuals of every race, that the only races in this game are 'white' and 'goblin'. I'm not going to make an inference as to what race goblins are in reality, it's pretty obvious, but I feel there should be more diversity here. \n\nI hope the developers of this game can take the time to fix these oversights in future patches, but as it stands, it's still worth the price.", "timestamp_created": 1502431538, "timestamp_updated": 1502692837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470383", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34161990": {"recommendationid": "34161990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033315719", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505357142}, "language": "english", "review": "You like Kingdom of Loathing, you love this.", "timestamp_created": 1502431465, "timestamp_updated": 1502431465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34161852": {"recommendationid": "34161852", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068340633", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1514018567}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember when I started playing Kingdom of Loathing back when I was younger, and it was the best experience ever.

I'm serious, it's not even funny.\n\nAs a long-time fan of Asymmetic Publications's...well, publications, I am well-aquainted with the weird, wonderful and wacky hijinks one can have with their wares. PSA: For those familiar with Kingdom of Loathing, skip the next few paragraphs, these are going to be for the newcomers.\n\nTo those that have never played Kingdom of Loathing (KoL), this game could can your laughter and sell it off on the open market for premium rates. Premium Canned Laughs. It is a thing. Asymmetic believes \"If it isn't funny or story-building, it doesn't belong.\"  and that motto is proved through the dense liana of jokes, quips, minor cattle-prodding at grammar and spelling, bizzare, surreal and otherwise humorous interactions that spice the game in liberal quanitities.\n\nIf Fallout 4's ideology is \"It's not the destination (or the dialogue), but the journey that's important\", WoL gives Bethesda a Double-Fisted Skull Smashing pound to the noggin and proclaims in proud fashion, \"You're an idiot.\" and proceeds to strip the padding out of boring searching for the next waypoint.  Travel is point-to-point with random encounters happing about once every travel, but they are quick interludes (that half-way decent Outfoxin' stats can resolve in most cases) in between the points of interest.\n\nEvery location has numerous interesting points to inspect; if it looks interesting, it's got something worth your time. Characters have depth to them, even if the dialogue can be linear at least it's not faking you out.  It's been a while that I've played a game where I want to talk to every NPC.\n\nCombat is fluid and deeper than your usual fare with satisfying results.  Statistics are limited to three main stats and a few damage+ stats, so the initial difficulty curve is lower as you're getting into it.  The automatic leveling suggestions are well-thought out and give you the option to spend your exp elsewhere for a bit if you wish (or all the time, the game only slightly judges you for this.)\n\nThe game deserves the praise it gets and it's a solid investment of your money and time.  Why are you still reading this?  I mean, thanks for doing that, but buy the game already!  Go on, I'll only judge you if you take more than a minute to hit that \"Add to Cart\" button.  I mean it, I'll judge you. *stares in judgement*\n\n\nTo those that have played KoL and know the score, this is up to Jick's usual stratospheric standards.  Best ten bucks I've spent for any Loathing-related purchase.  I do have a Dancing Frog, but that's 2 Mr. A's so that doesn't count.\n\nBut you KNOW this already, so why are you reading this? You probably want the skinny on what's different, right?  You played the WoL path...buuuuut...something's gotta be different, right?\n\nYou bet your bottom meat there is:\n\nStats defend against themselves - Mustle to Mustle, Myst to Myst, and Moxie to Mojo; maybe it's them hellcows been chewin' on the fabric of reality.  This is the biggest change aside from...\n\nSemi-grid-based combat - Positioning is important, but mostly for protecting yourself against ranged attacks.  Duck behind that barrel of beans, or beans in the shape of a barrel to keep stuff from shooting you in the <kneecap>.\n\nAction Points are your MP - And you get your AP back at the end of every combat.\n\nHP recovers at the end of combat - And it's a good thing it does...\n\nDeath comes on swift hooves - Did I mention the hellcows?  I'm sure I mentioned the hellcows.\n\nExp is a single resource - Instead of being split up into the substats you're used to, you just buy your stats with your accmulated exp.\n\nNo character levels - As there are no character levels in the West (guess they had a meeting and shot the guy that suggested it), you directly upgrate your levels in everything which includes...\n\nSkills have individual levels - No more one-size-fits-all skills, if you want them to be good, you have to put your exp into it.\n\nFood/Booze/Spleen gives buff effects last for a day - As such, your consumption is no longer about turn-gen, but what stats you want to buff that \"day\".  You can sleep, but that incriments...\n\nThe Day counter - guess there's a thing for speedrunners.  Wonder how that will work out in the future. I dunno, I just got this today!\n\nMuch Dialogue - Great speeching! Very talk! Must pat devs! Devs good bois.\n\nSpeak to Goblins! - No word on FARQUAR yet though...\n\nThere's enough the same that you'll feel comfortable slotting yourself into the world.  It breathes the same air as KoL does, but the Wild West has it's own flavor to it.\n\nIt's worth it.  Take that Mr. A money you were going to use and shove it in here. Asymmetric made this for you, after all.  They made it for others to get a glimpse of what KoL offers, but between the ghost pickles, Ellsbury (poor guy) and all the other subtle nods to KoLore, it was made for us first of all.  That Asymmetric made the game enjoyable for others to be able to play and feel included in is just Knob frosting on the Knob cake.\n\ntl;dr: Buy it.

Everything from undergraduate D&D games to Skeleton fort is represented in hilarious fashion.\n\nPolygon says that it's \"a genuinely deep and hilarious game\" and I can't overstate my agreement.

Don't be deceived by the low price point, this is hours and hours of face-hurting levels of belly laughs and incredible fun.

When each one of those walk cycles has their own unique sounds associated with them, you KNOW you're in for a good game.\n\nWest of Loathing is a RPG from the people who made Kingdom of Loathing, and shares its artstyle, humor, and some gameplay mechanics.  Yes, the artstyle is just stickfigures and black & white graphics, but it works, surprisingly.  Everything's well animated and detailed, despite the simplicity, giving it a certain nice charm.  The simplicity also helps for the UI, as there's very little clutter.  This helps, because your inventory gets -really- cluttered (which is a good thing, stick with me).\n\nGameplay is the standard \"loot and talk to people\" out of combat then \"turn-based combat\" combat.  Combat's simplistic, you and your ally take a turn, then your enemies.  Combat's rather easy, not only because it's easy to just out-stat your enemies with the various food, booze, and potion buffs, but also because combat items don't cost an action, thus allowing you to use as many as you need to finish off enemies.  There is a hard-mode, but I've yet to try it and see how combat's on it there.\nThe true meat of the game lies in the out of combat stuff.  There is a lot of things out in the West, and thus, a lot of writing.  Every item out of the hundreds of items has a small quip of description that's worth looking at, every location seems to be handcrafted with a purpose, and the dialogue is superb.  Still, there is a -lot- of writing, as said.  Between exploring eldritch horrors and necromantic power you shouldn't be tackling with, to a heartwarming relationship between a lass and man-cactus hybrid, it's all smart, well-written, and humorous.  The sheer volume of writing can be a slight turn off if that's not what you're into, but if you've read this far into the review, chances are you'd be the audience this game is selling to.\n\nIt's also rather nice that there's very little filler in this game.  I finished it in 7 hours, but I always felt like I was doing something in those seven hours.  Not like Skyrim or Fallout 4's generic caves and dungeons, everything seems to have it's own unique story or twist, and chances are you'll bump into a quest or someone that will point you towards something new. \nNot only that, but there's plenty of good puzzling to be had as well (most of it optional, if you're not the type, however), legit puzzles that get you Googling and searching about.  There's little grind as well, since there's plenty of just small flavor actions and text-encounters you have traveling about that grant you XP, though there are certain locations with infinite enemy spawners, in the off-chance you do want to grind.  \n\nIt's also pretty decent to replay.  The three different classes seem to play fairly differently, and there's a fair amount of different followers you can bring with you, each having different quips and dialogue, alongside the aforementioned hard mode.  There may be no need to actually replay the game, however, simply due to the sheer density of content available.\n\nWhile West of Loathing doesn't do much new in terms of gameplay, it makes up for it far more with it's superb writing and charm.  It avoids most of the pitfalls and downsides of most typical RPG games, with very little need to grind, and very little feeling of grinding.\n\nAnd only for 11 bucks?

You know how sometimes you can \"feel\" that a joke was intended but you missed the reference so it just felt awkward? That doesn't happen much in KoL and WoL.

If you don't like reading and potentially having to memorize or soak up information to do any of the multitudes of sidequests or side activities this game is not for you. The RPG aspect itself is not hard and due to the free roam nature of the game you will often find yourself either smashing your opponents or dying in one hit(does not happen often) There are interesting game mechanics that force you to think about what to do with your day.(do I insult myself in the morning for the stat buff, or do I keep the extra life for potentially tough fights?) However despite the up and down balance of the game this is a hidden gem. There are many, many, many, so many passives and intrinsics to find. The dialogue is rich, well thought out and hilarious to boot and the game awards you for exploration and problem solving. Character customization is lacking but fun to do as it is done via a shooting gallery. However leveling up your chatracter is deep and offers many choices to specialize. You can also rely on the game to level for you if you just want to jump in and play without the hassle of all that. Overall if you're unwilling to retain or write down information, or take the time to read through dialogue(albeit funny) this is not the game for you.\n\n(1 Hour Review)\nAfter I fell off a turnip wagon, crab walked my way through a road apple and rolled into a saloon, I knew I was in the old west. \n\nThe Cows have Come Home and the west isn't (as) safe anymore.

Gameplay wise the combat is a very simple turn based RPG format and thankfully easiily cheesed since the depth of the game is in deciding how to approach and solve puzzles through your character stats.

Much like new vegas this game lives and dies on its writing and world design. The combat itself is serviceable (and a significant amount more functional than that of New Vegas) but nothing special. I'm also gonna stop making comparions to New Vegas now because the only real similarity between the two is that they are video games. The writing is super silly, It's got tons of dumb dad jokes, anti-jokes, and the occasional real joke, but what I am finding most compelling so far is the weird underlying creepines of it. The currency of the game is meat, which isn't creepy on its own, but once you learn that the meat comes from the earth itself, it takes on a whole new feeling. There are also allusions to an almost apocalyptic event where cows turned on humanity, which sounds super silly, and it is, but you don't really get that much info on it. You're left to imagine it yourself. It's good shit.

It controlled beautifully and when the combat and travel started to get repetitive, there were settings to speed things up. Everything about this game was hilarious, from flavor text to quest lines to even the menu options. There were a few points I had to pause to stop laughing at how silly everything was.\n\nThe only issue I had was that the plot was kind of lacking.

What I mean by that is that after every fight you get back all your health and action points (look at this more like mana). The objective is just to survive (win) the combat you are currently doing. This makes the combat quite challenging sometimes, since enemies deal a lot of damage and it\u2019s all about action economy. There is a plethora of skills to use. Some that end you turn (mostly attacking) and some that don\u2019t (mostly summoning or using a consumable). This makes the combat fun and engaging!\n[b] 2 Puzzles\t[/b]\nThere are 2 kinds of puzzles in West of Loathing. \u201carea puzzles\u201d that make you look around the area to find clue\u2019s as to how to solve them, and \u201citem puzzles\u201d that bar your progress until you figure out how to obtain the necessary object. I am not a puzzle person but the puzzles in this game are great! They follow this weird logic that is present in the entire game, its completely silly but logic if you accept the silliness!\n[b] 3 Humor\t[/b]\nReally that\u2019s the third one? Yes! The entire game (down the options menu) is so seeped in jokes, puns and just damn silliness! This is going to be a personal preference, but man did I enjoy reading all the dialogue just for that humor. Very well written game! I think you can pick up really fast (after the first hour or so) if it is your kind of humor or not.\n\nGraphics are what you see is what you get (stick figures \u2026), but I do think that they are perfect for this game. Don\u2019t think the game would be better if it where beautifully animated/hand drawn, that just wouldn\u2019t fit \u2026! The story is \u2026 silly, like I said before it\u2019s completely silly but logic if you accept the silliness. And if you do that \u2026 surprisingly intriguing.

La verdad no queria hacer esta rese\u00f1a por que pensaba que no valia la pena perder mas tiempo con este juego. Pero acabo de estar un bullet hell que compre hace poco y me la pase tan bien que recorde lo lamentable que es este y algo dentro de mi me pide que diga lo malo que es... \u00bfPor donde empezar siendo que a mi me encantan los bullet hell y he jugado muchos a lo largo de mi vida?...\n-El juego es feo visualmente\n-El OST es lamentable y totalmente olvidable\n-\"Bullet hell\" es un genero que le queda muy pero muy grande\n-Hay mas enemigos en pantalla haciendo nada que proyectiles para esquivar\n-La \"habilidad\" que el juego pide es practicamente nulo\n-El gameplay es aburrido\n-Los personajes. Perdon el intento de personajes que te trata de dar son aburridos y dan algo de pena. Hay personajes en otros juegos o series que no hablan que al final tienen mas personalidad y son mas simpaticos que todo el staff juntos de este juego\n-El juego es muy caro para lo que es (El juego que compre hace poco y me impulso a hacer esta review me costo solo 1 dolar y sin descuento)\n-Solo 1 hora le pude dar a este juego y me pase como 4 fases sin morir. Si no hubiera sido por que casi me quedo dormido creo no hubiera perdido\nEn resumen, el juego es muy caro para lo lamentable que es. Hay pocas cosas de las que lamento gastar dinero, y este juego no le llevo mucho tiempo para que lo metiera en \"cosas que me arrepiento de comprar\". Si te quieres un poco y quieres un buen bullet hell no toques este ni con pinzas. Hay un juego bullet hell gratuito en el mismo steam que supera a este por muchisimo.

If you're new to bullet hells, I would reccomend playing the flash version first. So if you're a fan of the genre, just buy it now and stop reading. Well its over now anyways so you kinda have to stop... Oh well. Also, if you're a fan of RPGs, or more specifically JRPGs, then go ahead and get epic battle fantasy 3. If you like that, buy Epic Battle Fantasy 4 and if u like that and bullet hells just buy this game ok.", "timestamp_created": 1480183592, "timestamp_updated": 1480183679, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27705617": {"recommendationid": "27705617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009581636", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454213386}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros - None\n\nCons - Gameplay, graphics\n\nAvoid this game.

Bullet Heaven\n\nNun die ausf\u00fchhrliche Fassung:\n\nIch kann mich noch genau erinnern, viel ich das originale Bullet Heaven damals auf Kongregate gesuchtet habe. Wo ich froh \u00fcber nur 20 fps war, da das ausweichen der Kugeln besonders beim letzten Boss sehr viel einfacher wurde. Es gab sogar einen Tooltip der meinte, dass das Spiel mit wenigen Frames einfacher wird. \nDann habe ich das gesamte Danmaku genre eine Weile komplett aus den Augen verloren, bis ich Touhou entdeckt habe. Das Problem bei Touhou war nur, dass ich mich mehr f\u00fcr das Universum von Touhou als f\u00fcr die Spiele interessiert habe.\nJetzt habe ich wieder Bullet Heaven entdeckt und es hat mich sofort wieder gefesselt.\nAllein die Maussteuerung, welche ein gro\u00dfer Vorteil im Gegensatz zu anderen Danmaku ist, macht Bullet Heaven 2 f\u00fcr mich zu einem der besten Bullet Hells.\nVon der technischen Seite habe ich nicht viel zu sagen. es l\u00e4uft bei mir durchg\u00e4ngig auf 60 fps, weil es dort gecappt ist. Auch bei den Bossen, wo auf dem schwersten der 3 Schwierigkeitsgrade (Heavenly), sehr, sehr viele Partikel und Lichteffekte auf dem Bildschirm sind, komme ich nicht unter 58 fps. Der restliche Graphikstil ist vielleicht nicht f\u00fcr jeden was, mir gef\u00e4llt er aber.\nNun zum interessantesten Punkt des Spiels: dem Schwierigkeitsgrad.\nIn den 3 Stufen, kann man einstellen, ob man das Spiel an einem Tag oder in 1er bis mehreren Woche(n) durchspielen will. Der Unterschied zwischen der 1. und der 3. Stufe ist n\u00e4mlich eindeutig in der Anzahl der Kugeln auf dem Bildschirm zu erkennen. Besonders auf Heavenly hilft dann die f\u00fcr Danmaku typische 1 Pixel Hitbox. Ohne die, w\u00e4re das ausweichen n\u00e4mlich unm\u00f6glich.\nEinzig und allein das neue Shopsystem gef\u00e4llt mir \u00fcberhaupt nicht. Die Upgrades aus dem 1. Teil gibt es in dem Zusammenhang garnicht mehr. Man kann sich nur noch zwischen 3 verschiedenen Waffen pro Char, 3 Sub-waffen pro Char und jeweils 3 Upgrades zum Beispiel mehr Zeit zum Deathbomben oder ein st\u00e4rkerer Magnet. Schadensverbesserungen oder \u00e4hnliches gibt es aber nicht mehr.\n\n\nAlles in allem ist es aber ein gutes Spiel f\u00fcr Neulinge und Veteranen des Genres. Klare Kaufempfehlung. Testet aber erst Bullet Heaven 1, welches als flashgame komplett kostenlos online verf\u00fcgbar ist. Auch, wenn dort viel anders ist, bleibt der Danmaku Aspekt n\u00e4mlich gleich.", "timestamp_created": 1476517851, "timestamp_updated": 1476517851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25846506": {"recommendationid": "25846506", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983786651", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 1514242121}, "language": "english", "review": "zen type drug for 90's old school mofo 720 noscopers", "timestamp_created": 1475537488, "timestamp_updated": 1475537488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.452040", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25838694": {"recommendationid": "25838694", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057424551", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475505049}, "language": "english", "review": "Bullet Heaven 2 puts you in the shoes of either Matt or NoLegs from Epic Battle Fantasy, with the rest of the heroes and three bonus characters being unlockable as you play the game.

I mean there are some fun ones, but they usually play by a controller or keyboard, which I am not good with, and dont allow a mouse like this one, which I praise it for.\n\nThe enemies and bosses are pretty fun, and the difficulty curves appropiately from simple things to hard stuff. So its easy for newcomers to understand the game. Plus having things like cheats and handicaps makes it even more so for those looking for a challenge, or to just muck around.\n\nThe soundtrack is one of my favorites, right next to Hotline Miami. Every stage just has the most appropiate music for what it shows.\n\n\nNow come the cons\n\nAt times the game just straight up drops frames, throwing me at a downside cause i cant react in the 6 seconds it takes for my character to react and move to where I want them to move. If anything, this is so unforgivable. I mean how is a game as simple as this laggy as ever at the most random times?? Especially when I have a high end computer. I dont know if others suffer the same thing, but if so this needs to be fixed. This has happened to me on numerous occations, and I'll record and show it if I have to prove somethins wrong. Might be just me, but I doubt it.\n\nSecondly, I am going to say in the boss music it gets [i] slightly [/i] repetitive. It lasts for a couple of bosses, then the EX boss music suddenly goes to the normal boss music for the next couple of normal bosses, and thats where the cycle repeats. I'm not asking for a bit of music for every little detail, but you do hear some things a little often.\n\n\nOverall, a fun game! Something I'd recommend if you're just looking to have some passive fun or an exciting challenge in the realm of bullet hells.

The harder difficulty settings give you a real challenge, and get so hard I've not managed to clear stage 1-1 on the hardest difficulty yet despite years of casually fiddling with danmakus.\n\nThe game also has some nice customization options to let you tailor your experience for your taste... money dropped by enemies can be used to unlock cheats to make the game easier, handicaps to make it harder, and lots of customization options like alternate weapons and characters; each has slightly different play style and switching up characters or weapons to suit the stage you're going to play has a big impact on your experience. You can play co-op with up to 3 friends for an easier or harder time depending on how well you coordinate your attacks, too.\n\nThe game doesn't punish you for using cheats and playing it safe, but it rewards you for playing well. Each stage has 3 extra-difficult optional bonus waves accessed if you get enough Perfects on the normal waves, which offer huge score boosts and extra cash for the unlockables; you can unlock hidden bosses and stages in each world, and all the game's achievements also rewards you with a substantial amount of unlockables cash giving you an incentive to achieve them. There's also a bunch of achievements awarded for very silly or stupid-to-attempt things encouraging you to take the game less serious and try things outside your comfort zone, and before you know it, it'll become second nature.\n\nBullet Heaven 2 combines the best parts of Jamestown's co-op and Touhou's tight bullet pattern design with a small pinch of roguelike elements, and it's pretty unique in the amount of polish and quality it has, but the best parts of it is how accessible it is.

While I look back at that game with nostalgia, and BH2 is an improvement in every way, I still have a hard time recommending it having played the likes of Touhou, Crimzon Clover, or Cave's stuff.\n\nThere's admittedly a lot to like here. The boss levels are all pretty good. There's a lot of fun bullet patterns in every difficulty, so you can basically dive in no matter your skill level. This idea is taken further with the \"cheats and handicaps\" system which is supposed to let you further customise your difficulty. The cheats being an interesting alternative to the continues you would get in most STGs, bringing the idea into an arcadeless era. There are achievements and lots of unlockables.\n\nBut the game is really let down by the non-boss levels. There are very many of these and they quickly start feeling like a slog. While there are quite a few enemies, they tend to just spawn in big rectangles and either throw bullets directly at you or everywhere. I guess it gets the defense right, as weaving through bullets feels good, but not really the offensive side. If feels like enemies can either be spawn-killed or are tanky to the point where killing them doesn't really feel good.\n\nThere are also problems having to do with how the game is in flash. That means you might need a more powerful machine than you might expect to run it smoothly, and running an STG smoothly is paramount. I also couldn't get it working on Linux and so had to boot up my rusty win7 install, which I don't like to do.\n\nThat having been said I don't regret my purchase.

I played through the entire game on only Heavenly difficulty and it took me around 15 hours to get all the achievements. I have a lot of bullet hell experience and this game still managed to challenge me, but not always for the right reasons... in spite of these complaints I did enjoy the game and the lower difficulties make it quite accessible.\n\nMy first major issue was the constant lag spikes I was getting. I haven't had these since my first playthrough of the game, and so this issue isn't one any more.\n\nMy second issue is that some of the waves are completely unreasonable or require a perectly choreographed path to complete. Most enemies shoot additional bullets on being killed, but they also flood the screen if not killed. So you'd think you just balance that by killing a few, dodge what's left... but that rarely worked. The only feasible way to handle most stage waves is to speedkill enemies. Further, some enemies (especially in world 9) have really dumb patterns. My preferred shot type was Matt with either the Titan Blade or Holy Swords, and neither of these have spread coverage. The homing shots in this game felt pretty weak as well, and can't keep the stronger enemies off the board. So overall some stages are designed so that different waves are nearly impossible for different shot types. That's not exactly great, but it's an unavoidable side effect of 24 different shots available. But when a lot of them are forward focus only, it's not unreasonable to expect forward-focus to be able to manage the waves and seeing that many waves couldn't be reasonably done was a little disappointing.\n\nThe next issue I had was the diamond system. This is more of a personal nitpick than anything else, but you only get diamonds for killing all enemies in a wave without bombing while at full health. If the first 2 requirements are met, a heart is dropped instead, and if an enemy escapes or you bomb, nothing is dropped. Hearts and diamonds both refill both the primary and secondary gauges, allowing the next wave to be speedkilled easier. Bombing costs 1 diamond but losing a life costs 2: that wave itself plus the next one which becomes a heart. This makes any early mistakes immediately catastrophic for a rank, which was especially annoying on bosses or when I got hit as a resullt of a lag spike.\n\nBuilding on the previous, the survival levels are quite fun...until you get dealt a ridiculous wave nearly impossible for the shot type you went in with and die. It turns what would otherwise be a nice test of skill into an RNG-fest. Again, world 9's enemies are either well balanced or absurd, and the absurd waves can end an attempt just by appearing. The item drops range from helpful to useless depending on when they're randomly dropped, as well. These levels were still fun, but could have been much stronger. And that's true of much of the game as well.\n\nFinally: the bosses. They, like the rest of the game, lack a real difficulty curve. Past the first stage I felt like the difficulty stayed overall constant, with random absurd spikes. The bosses fall into this as well with some patterns being trivial, and then immediately followed up by nearly impossible waves. The final boss takes this almost too far, with my star approach being capture the first 3, carefully choreographed wave 4 with 1 bomb, capture the nearly absurd wave 5 and 6, bomb 7 and 8, capture 9 (which is trivial once you realize it's just vertical streaming), and dodge wave 10, which is absurd. I'm sure the balance is better on hard, but that doesn't mean that the highest difficulty should be unbalanced.\n\nSo in conclusion: Bullet Heaven 2 is a good, fun bullet hell held back from being great by balance issues. If you like bullet hells, you'll like this game, but may find it frustrating in places.  When it's good, it's amazing (World 6 bosses especially). Just be mindful of the schizophrenic curve.\n\nedit, 2 years later: my biggest issue was lag, as mentioned above, and on my current setup I haven't had that problem once.

Your main weapon gets a lot weaker with continuous fire and you have to wait a moment for it to recharge to full strength. You can also equip a sub-weapon which is more powerful, but takes a lot longer to recharge. Not being able to attack constantly felt awkward at first.\n\nAfter a few worlds, things started to click because the game's design meshes perfectly with the weapon system. Taking out large groups and dangerous enemies with full firepower, then pursuing stragglers while my sub weapon recharged soon became second nature. And then there are the bullet patterns, which are among the best I've ever seen. The spider boss alone is a marvel to behold. Then you get plants shooting lilypad-shaped bullets, or clouds shooting raindrops and snowflakes. The visual design is simply outstanding. The soundtrack is also great and comes as free DLC with the game.\n\nBullet Heaven 2 may look daunting, but the game is actually very forgiving. I was able to finish Hard mode in 4 hours without hitting a wall. Most of the challenge comes from score attacking and the optional Heavenly difficulty, which is fine. I did encounter some rather extreme glitches, but nothing that a quick restart of the game wouldn't fix. \n\nOverall, I'm really impressed by how well-designed this game turned out to be.

still challenging and fun\n\nCons\n\n- The hitbox for the bullets is quite smaller than the sprite, and when you turn on high contrast bullets to fix this, all the bullets turn into white round

O jogo \u00e9 grande e tem excelentes fases que v\u00e3o dificultando a cada vez que voc\u00ea vai se aproximando do final.\n\nO gr\u00e1fico do jogo \u00e9 bom, remete a desenhos. A trilha sonora tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 boa (e o melhor \u00e9 que ela j\u00e1 vem inclu\u00edda gratuitamente na pasta do jogo), por\u00e9m a trilha repete muito, s\u00e3o cerca de cinco fases antes do boss e em todas \u00e9 a mesma trilha. Dependendo de como voc\u00ea jogar as fases podem demorar, ou seja, fica enjoativo ficar escutando a mesma m\u00fasica, por isso aconselho preparar uma playlist antes de come\u00e7ar o jogo.\n\nA dificuldade \u00e9 bem equilibrada, nada muito dif\u00edcil mas tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o deixa a desejar, mesmo nos n\u00edveis mais elevados. O jogo n\u00e3o tem a dificuldade F\u00e1cil, mas creio que mesmo sem ter jogado nenhum jogo de danmaku a pessoa conseguir\u00e1 se adaptar bem a ele no n\u00edvel Normal pois, como j\u00e1 citei antes, a dificuldade vai se elevando gradativamente.\n\nUm dos pontos fortes desse jogo que sobressaem a maioria dos jogos no estilo danmaku \u00e9 que ele usa quase toda a dimens\u00e3o 16:9 dos monitores atuais, diferente da maioria dos jogos de danmaku que utilizam como base os monitores de arcade, ficando limitado e uma pequena tela. O bom de utilizar o widescreen \u00e9 que voc\u00ea v\u00ea milhares de tiros na tela e na minha opini\u00e3o isso \u00e9 \u00f3timo e prazeroso, fazendo muito bem para a vista, principalmente na dificuldade Celestial.\n\nOutro ponto excelente nele \u00e9 sua dimens\u00e3o como um todo! A maioria dos jogos danmaku s\u00e3o cerca de 6 fases e em 30 minutos voc\u00ea chega no final. J\u00e1 o Bullet Heaven 2 tem um sistema de mundos com v\u00e1rias fases dentro de cada um, e o melhor \u00e9 que voc\u00ea pode voltar a qualquer momento em qualquer fase. Isso \u00e9 \u00f3timo tamb\u00e9m para quem n\u00e3o \u00e9 muito bom nesse tipo de jogo para conseguir treinar quando chegar em n\u00edveis mais avan\u00e7ados.\n\nA hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 apenas para justificar os acontecimentos, nada profunda. O jogo tamb\u00e9m tem um \u00f3timo fator de repeti\u00e7\u00e3o, pois voc\u00ea tem v\u00e1rios itens para comprar na loja, v\u00e1rios cheats e desvantagens para fazer o jogo ficar ainda mais desafiador, al\u00e9m da classifica\u00e7\u00e3o e pontos em cada fase, se voc\u00ea buscar tirar nota boa e fazer v\u00e1rios pontos em todas as fases, o tempo do jogo vai se estender bastante! O jogo tamb\u00e9m tem um modo multiplayer! Voc\u00ea pode colocar para outras 3 pessoas jogarem no mouse ou no controle, algo inovador, que eu nunca tinha visto em nenhum jogo de Danmaku antes!\n\nSe voc\u00ea gostar de jogos danmaku recomendo muito a compra desse jogo! Se voc\u00ea nunca jogou, tem uma vers\u00e3o gratuita dele no site do desenvolvedor, recomendo dar uma jogada l\u00e1 antes para ver se voc\u00ea se adapta a jogabilidade, caso goste recomendo a compra aqui na Steam para incentivar o desenvolvedor.", "timestamp_created": 1459700008, "timestamp_updated": 1459700008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22083353": {"recommendationid": "22083353", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975586162", "num_games_owned": 1092, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464001717}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "Q\u7248\u5f48\u5e55\u5c04\u64ca\u904a\u6232\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7c21\u55ae\n\n\u50b7\u5bb3\u5224\u5b9a\u5728\u89d2\u8272\u4e2d\u5fc3\u9ede\uff0c\u6c92\u6709\u78b0\u89f8\u5230\u4e0d\u6703\u9020\u6210\u50b7\u5bb3\n\n\u53ef\u591a\u4eba\u904a\u73a9\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5fc5\u9808\u5171\u7528\u6ed1\u9f20\u9375\u76e4\n\n\u6536\u96c6\u6389\u843d\u7684\u91d1\u9322\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5546\u5e97\u8cfc\u8cb7\u9053\u5177\u4f5c\u5f0a\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u6b66\u5668\u4ee5\u53ca\u670d\u88dd\n\n\u4e5f\u6709\u589e\u5f37\u6575\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9053\u5177\uff0c\u85c9\u6b64\u4f86\u7372\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u95dc\u5361\u5206\u6578\u52a0\u6210\n\n\u6bcf\u4e00\u6ce2\u6575\u4eba\u7121\u50b7\u64ca\u7834\u6703\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u9846\u947d\u77f3\uff0c\u7528\u4f86\u63d0\u9ad8\u95dc\u5361\u8a55\u7b49(E~A->1\u661f~3\u661f)\uff0c3\u661f\u70ba\u6700\u9ad8\n(\u751f\u547d\u6c92\u6eff\u7684\u72c0\u6cc1\u4e0b\u7121\u50b7\u5247\u662f\u7d66\u6062\u5fa9\u9053\u5177)\n\n\u6574\u500b\u95dc\u5361\u5b8c\u5168\u7121\u50b7\u6700\u5f8c\u9084\u6703\u6709\u52a0\u5206\u95dc\u5361\n\n\u904a\u6232\u6709\u4e00\u500b\u5c0f\u6280\u5de7\uff0c\u88ab\u64ca\u4e2d\u50b7\u5bb3\u5224\u5b9a\u7684\u77ac\u9593\u4e1fboom\u53ef\u4ee5\u62b5\u92b7\u9019\u6b21\u50b7\u5bb3", "timestamp_created": 1459081062, "timestamp_updated": 1459523706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22072246": {"recommendationid": "22072246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213121957", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502461112}, "language": "english", "review": "\"I'm safe from cold, I have a hat!\" -Matt\nI wish I could use that argument when mom doesn't let me go out in cold weather.", "timestamp_created": 1459028311, "timestamp_updated": 1459351173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22041664": {"recommendationid": "22041664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044863558", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502121395}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Pros:[/h1]\nAbsolutely fun through the entire game, even more so with multiple people.\nSupport for XBOX and PS4 controllers.\n8 unique characters, each with 3 secondary attacks to choose from.\nLots of choice in gameplay styles and customisation.\n70 unique levels.

OK so initially i was a little harsh on this game, not because of the game, but because of the game. $12 in my books still is a bit much to me. yes i got it for 75% off witha voucher from a crafting drop then sold the trading cards off setting the game itself. so i essentially got the game for free. the game itself is really great, lots to unlock and lots of variety. its a very casual shmup. although it is difficult in later levels. i do love the art style and dialogue of the game. the characters are adorable. if you like anime and shmups, its a must have, but i would say wait for a sale. go play the flash alternative until then.\n\nps. do not get me wrong about the game, its a great game, but there are better free games on my phone, so the $12 is a hard pill to swallow for me....",

excellent. It defies genre conventions in subtle ways, and in doing so produces a game that is enjoyable beyond the usual niche scope of this sort of thing. \n\nThe most important thing for me is that it provides you with plenty of things to do besides endlessly repeating the same six levels for score. There's a lot of content! 70 levels, and the non-boss waves are an interesting challenge on their own instead of being a pointless grind. Plus there's a variety of characters and modes to unlock, and in-game achievements covering a wide range of potential activities. \n\nThe other big difference compared to other danmaku is that the game is rather forgiving. The actual waves and patterns are as hard as any bullet hell, but you can recover life in a stage and can always start from any stage you've unlocked -- no endlessly repeating the first few areas in search of a one credit clear here. To me, this makes the game feel far more fair and approachable. I find myself wanting to put in the effort to learn the harder patterns, since the game makes them available to practice as much as I need to. \n\nAs for the rest, it's a very solid entry in the genre. Great music, cute art and character designs, and amusing party banter at the start and end of each level. Controls and interface are solid, and it's refreshing to play a danmaku that properly uses widescreen resolutions. \n\nMy thanks to Matt Roszak for another great release -- looking forward to EBF5!", "timestamp_created": 1455435013, "timestamp_updated": 1455435013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504943", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21195178": {"recommendationid": "21195178", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995000909", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513117205}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm pretty crappy at writing up all the pros and cons of a videogame, so I'm just going to say this: I have never felt as satisfied in a video game as in this. It is as hard as you want it to be, and it's really easy to set goals and mileposts for yourself.\n\nI literally shouted at the top of my lungs and did a happy dance as I beat the final boss on hard with the \"1 life\" modifier on. I had been trying to do that for about a week or so, and through practice and learning the bullet patterns, I finally managed.\n\nIn that, the game is VERY fair. If you lost, it meant that you did something wrong. That your reaction time was too long, that your movement to react to an incoming bullet was too fast and you hit something else. That you messed up in dodging attacks and found yourself cornered by bullets unable to escape. It'll never throw bullshit at you that was impossible to dodge. If you get hit, it means you need to get better, you need to learn how to dodge the patterns that those specific enemies throw at you. And believe me you will. The learning curve is very well done, and the unlockable handicaps and cheats help in finetuning that process.\nAs you graduate from normal to hard or heavenly, you'll have a bit of things to adjust to (suddenly all enemies explode into bullets), but just playing through the worlds again is equally satisfying as the first time on normal.\n\nIn short, if you have any interest whatsoever in the genre, buy this, you won't regret it.", "timestamp_created": 1455415645, "timestamp_updated": 1455415645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21167411": {"recommendationid": "21167411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061695090", "num_games_owned": 446, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467142371}, "language": "english", "review": "Bullet Heaven 2 is a SHMUP. It's made by Kupogames, an indie game dev that has made the beloved (to me, at least) Epic Battle Fantasy series.\n\nAnd Bullet Heaven 2 is freakin' cool.\n\nIt's a game with flexible difficulty, that never challenges you with more than you're ready to tackle. But that doesn't mean it's easy. No, no, the game is rather deliciously hard! I've spent a few hours agonizing over character configurations and what options I could afford to turn on or off in order to get the best result possible.\n\nThat's one of the key points of the game: It has options, purchases, and other such things, but none of those ever make the game easier to master. It just gives you more options to attack the problem. Turning on \"cheats\" will give you various benefits, but decrease your score. Turning on \"handicaps\" will make the game more difficult, but boost your score. And scoring is universal- every difficulty and every option is posted on the same scoreboard. There's no \"wrong\" way to play.\n\nAnd that's what I love about the game. It's a shooter that's not punishing you for being \"hardcore\" enough. It's a shooter that's there so that you can have fun playing it. It's a shooter for you.\n\nIf you have any interest in shooters, give Bullet Heaven 2 a try!", "timestamp_created": 1455332059, "timestamp_updated": 1455332059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

a quirky, amusing cast of characters that are incredibly genre-savvy?\n\nThen you might like Bullet Heaven 2! For the reasons why I like and recommend this game, keep reading!\n\n======\n\nLike most people, I started getting into Matt Roszak's games through the Epic Battle Fantasy RPGs. Eventually, I was surprised to learn that Roszak expanded into other game genres, particularly the Arcade-style vertical Shooter. Yes, I played Bullet Heaven long before the sequel was released. While I enjoyed the game quite a bit, I didn't feel like it stood out that much amongst the other flash-based shooters I played (sorry Matt).\n\nThankfully, Bullet Heaven 2 cuts out the bits that held the original game back and tightens its gameplay to a laser-focused point. BH2 is a true arcade shmup to the core, for all the right reasons.\n\nThe main thing that was dropped from Bullet Heaven 1 was the Upgrade Shop. You could buy powerups for your characters using the gold gained from defeated enemies. While this is nice and all, it made the game play out entirely differently from BH2. Your upgrades dictated your skill level, not your actual skill itself (though in BH1's defense, some of the levels are super hard even with upgrades). Axing the Upgrade Shop was a very smart idea and I feel BH2 benefitted heavily from the change.\n\nThat being said, how [i]does[/i] BH2 play? Well, like a typical score-based shmup, as one may expect. You dodge bullets, you shoot enemies, you collect the point items you drop, and that's about it. You can control your character through either the keyboard, mouse or controller, though I honestly prefer the mouse. The amount of control and precision offered with the mouse is incredible, and I wish more shmup games like this had mouse (though maybe they don't for that reason, sometimes the mouse is TOO accurate at times, at least when the game isn't lagging). \n\nYou will probably need this precision quite badly in Bullet Heaven 2, because as the screenshots show, it's one of those Danmaku-style games where bullets fill the screen, creating claustrophobic patterns for you to weave through. Games like these can be intimidating at first, BH2 gives you many options to change the difficulty. aside from the three difficulty levels that adjust the number of bullets the enemies fire, there are cheats and handicaps to adjust your attack power and bullet speed, give you more health/bombs and temporary powerups. If you don't care about unlocking high-end stuff or high scores and just want to blast things, feel free to use the Cheats as upgrades to make things easier.\n\nIf you DO want to chase high scores and three-star rankings, however, the game has a simple yet effective scoring system in plae. Cheats lower score, Handicaps increase it, as does the difficulty itself. Clearing an enemy wave without getting hit, running out of time or bombing gives you a diamond, which boosts your score multiplier. Therefore, getting a high score mainly relies on clearing waves quickly, though you can also gain some extra points by collecting the coins enemies drop. And since this is a bullet hell game, you earn points for grazing bullets and clearing them from the screen too, though depending on the difficulty they may or may not be worth the effort.\n\nIn addition to chasing Medals and High Scores, the shop in this game adds alternate sub-weapons and costumes for each character, changing their play style. I honestly prefer using a costume that increases my item-grabbing radius, as I love collecting coins and increasing my score with them. When I'm not chasing achievements, I usually use Phrynna in her Fairy Wings outfit, she has amazing damage output against most bosses and enemies (I use Dry NoLegs for things like the robotic wasp boss).\n\nSpeaking of weapons, each character has a sub-weapon in addition to their main shot, which can be fired off once their subweapon gauge is full. You can also charge up an attack with your main shot to deal extra damage, but I rarely use it. Each smart bomb also acts a little differently and does damage depending on the character and mods you are using, but you can only carry so many per level, so use them wisely!\n\nIn terms of content and story...Well, there's not too much of a story. Monsters start attacking Matt and friends out of the blue, so they travel across ten or so worlds to try and figure out why they're being targeted. [spoiler]It turns out that the final boss of EBF3, Akron, was apparently behind this mess. Didn't expect that![/spoiler] The story is told through dialog between the party members before and after each stage, and it is pretty funny most of the time. Matt's the dim-witted warrior, Natalie's the sarcastic magical girl, Lance is the somewhat serious tech-head (whom has a serious crush on Natalie), Anna is the nature girl, and NoLegs...Is the team pet, not much else to say there, heh. [spoiler]Dry NoLegs and Slime Bunny appear in a couple of scenes, but they have little effect on the plot, and Phyrnna doesn't appear at all in the story. There's also no proper ending cutscene or credits after the final boss, so be aware of that.[/spoiler] Each world has seven levels; four normal story levels, a boss level, a tougher boss, and an endless level.\n\nIn terms of presentation...The game looks great. Roszak's cartoony anime-ish art style really fits the setting for this game, yet he also does a fine job of making some truly detailed and intimidating monsters and backgrounds. There is also a gallery where you can choose the sidebar graphics, main menu backgrounds, and even listen to the awesome music Phrynna made for this game! The game can run at a smooth 60 FPS, or it can be locked at 30 FPS if you feel your computer can't handle 60 FPS for whatever reason. Lots of graphical options and screen sizes exist as well, so tweak them to your liking. I didn't have that many visibility problems while playing this game, aside from getting hit by a bullet that was hiding behind another bullet or something dumb like that.\n\nAnd yes, like most arcade shmups, there is Multiplayer, but I feel it gets in the way of pursuing high scores since you have to work well with your friends to get said high scores. It's good for a laugh, however.\n\nI apologize for this being a lengthy review, but I hope it's been helpful regardless.

But at the end of the day, it is still a Bullet Hell game.  If you don't derive any enjoyment from moving your tiny hitbox (it's one pixel) through intricate patterns of near-death, then this will game will quickly wear thin for you.  If on the other hand you have even a passing interest in this genre or SHMUPs of any kind, you will definitely enjoy this game.\n\nGameplay:  Many others have listed the numbers, but there are a crap ton of stages with 3 difficulty levels, and each world has two bosses as well as a random survival level.  The game's characters all have minor differences and 3 subweapons each, with no two subweapons being exactly the same.  You will definitely find something that suits your playstyle in this bunch.  There are optional cheats and handicaps to tweak the difficulty both ways, but nothing in the way of permanent upgrades like in BH1.  This game is more \"pure\" than that; your character does not improve over time, only your skill does.  The high scores are heavily influenced by difficulty, meaning that the only way to compete for top scores on the leaderboards is to git gud at Heavenly difficulty.  This provides a nice incentive for players to get better, while in no way locking out casual players from completing the game on Normal.\n\nControls:  Responsive but not without caveats.  The Mouse and Keyboard setup is clearly most ideal, as mouse movement gives you a huge advantage in precision.  It also supports controllers including properly analog stick control, which when combined with other features can yield enough precision to even beat Heavenly difficulty without resorting to mouse.  There is a \"focus\" button to slow down your character while held, but you can invert this option to always move slowly and use the button to gain a sprint mode.  Highly recommended as the setup for controller, but redundant for mouse since you can just move the mouse less.  Unfortunately, you can't remap or rebind almost any of these control options.\n\nGraphics:  Overly cutesy with soft lines and pleasant, but obviously flash, animation.  The character art is something I'm used to and is true to Matt's usual style.  It's a huge step up from BH1 though.  Conversely, the bullets themselves look highly professional and the boss patterns match up to anything else on the market.  The game has performance issues for some people, but playing in windowed mode instead of fullscreen seems to fix most FPS issues.\n\nSoundtrack:  Unbelievable, 11/10.  Halyconic Falcon X (Phyrnna) is the composer and is even a playable character this time around.  You get the entire OST FOR FREE when you buy the game, and can listen to any song in-game in the gallery.  The SFX are mostly decent.  Some are really good, but some of the enemy shot SFX are kinda grating and annoying to me.  Fortunately the options let you turn off these sounds (among other things) if you so desire.\n\nFinally, this game has some sort of mysterious power to be HIGHLY addicting.  I get that way with new games a lot, but everyone I personally know who owns this game, has a really hard time putting it down.", "timestamp_created": 1450924107, "timestamp_updated": 1450924107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510391", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19877087": {"recommendationid": "19877087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065559123", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501873692}, "language": "english", "review": "The Most Funniest Game I have ever played\n1) Game Breaks Fourth Wall\n2) Polished!\n3) All I know cause i haven't beat it yet", "timestamp_created": 1450885559, "timestamp_updated": 1450885559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19859093": {"recommendationid": "19859093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013299321", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 5087, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503704908}, "language": "english", "review": "I love everything about it!!I love everything that is EBF related!!!!\n\n*  L O V E    I N T E N S I F I E S *", "timestamp_created": 1450836901, "timestamp_updated": 1450836901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19838902": {"recommendationid": "19838902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132985351", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481709240}, "language": "english", "review": "I truly recommend this game to anyone who loves bullet hells.\n\nThis game has a league of option.

You can go ahead and just play through the ten worlds and be done, play through them again on higher difficulties, hunt for achievements (Matt thought of everyone!), purchase everything, fight the bonus bosses and then play the endless survival modes, and so on.\n\nThere's a good deal of customization, with 8 characters whose playstyles are different, yet not too different that they present a learning curve. Each character has 4 total costumes and 3 different sub-weapons.

Ich bin ganz einfach genervt von dem Spiel.[/spoiler][/h1]\n\nWarum?\nGanz einfach, die meiste Zeit in dem Spiel steckt man Treffer von Gegnern ein und muss somit etliche Niederlagen unweigerlich \"akzeptieren\". Das sorgt daf\u00fcr, dass sich Aggressionen freisetzen . Doch anstelle mich geschlagen zu geben, versuche ich es nochmal... und nochmal... und nochmal... und das setzt sich solange fort bis ich vor lauter Emotionen aufgebe, oder ich Welle 10 von Boss Nr. X endlich mal \"gemeistert\" habe. Damit sind f\u00fcr mich Aggressionen, unkontrollierte Wutausbr\u00fcche, kaputte Hardware-Komponenten, Verteufelungen und Fl\u00fcche verbunden, die ich auf mich nehme, um \"Bullet Heaven 2\" zu spielen. Aber genau das hat ja seinen Anreiz es zu spielen...    Genau eben diese Herausforderung\n\nDas ist es was ich an diesem Spiel (eigentlich bei dem Genre) eigentlich so mag. Es ist eine verdammt schwierige Herausforderung, die man immer und immer wieder versucht zu meistern, dabei jedoch die ganze Zeit scheitert. Das Gef\u00fchl von Adrenalin, Euphorie, Wut und Aggressionen ist eine vielleicht seltsame Kombination an Gef\u00fchlen die man bei einem Spiel empfindet, aber nachdem man einen Boss auf dem h\u00f6chsten Schwierigkeitsgrad mit zus\u00e4tzlichen Handicaps besiegt, ist die Euphorie dann doch am sch\u00f6nsten.\n\nBez\u00fcglich der Menge an Inhalten des Spiels zitiere hier nun einmal Matt: \"Der Entwickler liebt es, an allen Ecken zu sparen, und er sagt, dass Survivallevel leichter zu erstellen sind als Bosse... oder sowas in der Art.\"\nInhalte und Features  sind ja in den Spielbeschreibungen soweit zu lesen. Darauf will ich auch nicht weiter eingehen. Mit Ausnahme, dass aus meiner Sicht die Steam-Features in \"Bullet Heaven 2\" sehr gut integriert sind. Die Leaderboards werden in den passenden Momenten aktualisiert und sind auch bei der Stageauswahl leicht zu \u00f6ffnen. Was mir trotz der F\u00fclle fehlt, sind die Optionen zum Anpassen der Steuerung (gerade weil ich auch gern mit 3rd-Party Controllern gern spiele), wobei f\u00fcr mich die Steuerung vom Spiel aus dennoch gut genug ist.\n\nF\u00fcr mich ist \"Bullet Heaven 2\" das beste Spiel was man in diesem Genre aus meiner Sicht zurzeit finden kann und bietet bez\u00fcglich der Jagd nach den Achievements sehr viel Spielspa\u00df (f\u00fcr mich jedenfalls), Frust, Aggressionen, kaputte Hardware-Komponenten und dennoch das Gef\u00fchl der Euphorie.\n\n[i]Wenn ihr eine Meinung, Feedback, Spam oder dass man Review euch \u00fcberzeugt hat, es zu holen, schreibt es doch bitte in Kommentare.

And it certainly delivered.\nIf I were to describe the game with one word, it would be [b]satisfying[/b]. It took the very best features of the original and made them even better. More characters, more weapons, more BADA** BOSSES, longer levels [strike]and a bigger d**k[/strike] But let's look at things in a bit more detail.\nWe have 8 playable characters, each with a different play style and a bunch of weapons and costumes (those provide some minor bonuses) to boot. My personal favourites are Matt, Phyrnna and NoLegs (that kitty is OP as hell, btw). Making use of their strengths and avoiding their weaknesses is ESSENTIAL for surviving on difficulties other then Normal (though the final set of levels  may argue with that - those are quite nightmarish even on Normal).\nSpeaking of difficulty, there is a lot of ways for the player to customize it. Enabling certain cheats and handicaps gives a chance to those of us who are not well-versed in bullet-hells AND can satisfy even the toughest of hardcore players. My personal favourite handicap is pacifist mode. It leaves the player with no ways to damage enemies, forcing him/her to survive through waves by waiting for them to end. Also that makes some levels hard as b***s. Even on Normal. Luckily, only one pixel of the character can take damage making things fair.\nNext, the BOSSES. Yes, all caps, they deserve it. The patterns of bullet-hells they tend to generate can and will leave you speechless. They look amazing and are deadly enough to push you to the very extent of your abilities. Keep in mind, btw, some of their shots bounce, so if you are like me and prefer to keep your distance, you can get some surprise [strike]b**tsex[/strike] attacks from behind. My personal favourite is the Wicked Weaver. Seriously, look at that thing and try telling me you don't want this adorable monstrosity as a pet.\nAlso the final BOSS. [spoiler]This is where I have to forego my verdict of \"fair\" as this guy is anything but that. Seriously, if you play on Normal and think that things are kind of easy, wait for the final stage before cranking the difficulty up. Akron is the worst features of every boss so far thrown in a blender and spiced with some cyanide just to make sure. Hardcore guys - have fun beating him on Hard and Heavenly for 3-stars rating.[/spoiler]\nAnd last, but not the least, the soundtrack. Phyrnna (the composer) outdid herself. Every tune fits the level [b]perfectly[/b], especially boss themes. Those will make your blood boil, trust me. Also catchy as hell. This is where I struggle to name a personal favourite as all the tracks are worthy of the title.\n\nTo summarize: awesome action, incredible music, smooth controls, cute visuals and customizable difficulty. If you played BH1 than this is everything you ever dreamed of. If not - it's easy enough to get into so hop on. Buy it, I can guarantee that you won't regret a single penny.\nP.S. And now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to try and finally do that pacifist marathon.

It's art style has a cute yet striking appearance that does the job, despite the fact that it can get in the way of combat at times. But you are here for the shoot em up gameplay, which focuses on action and dodging with the amount of bullets on the screen. Great amount of choice for score chasers out there in getting the most out of each run, while still providing comfort for those who need a bit of help. \n\nWhat's interesting here is that Bullet Heaven 2's wave based gameplay feels accessible for newer players in the genre, and yet its weapon charge system will have those veterans of the genre take notice with it's slight differences in gameplay.  It's what you want if you're looking for another game in the genre to refresh your pallet: something twisted a bit so that it stands out, but keeping its core components the same to still make it feel like the genre in question in the end. Definitely worth the time, especially if you're looking for game to chase high scores in. \n\nThe game is available on Kongerate without the expansions, but the game is worth your time in any form, and it's a good experience regardless of the expansion or not. I can recommend to support the developer in question, and those who don't want to spend the money can go play it on kongerate. \n\n[b] Gameplay Footage and Video Review: https://youtu.be/aFZjsJuzIFU[/b]\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]+:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] There's a lot of smart decisions in the score based mechanic to really help players take their gameplay to the next level. The cheat/handicap multiplier system is great to help players who need help on certain difficulties. It understands the strengths of the genre, while not being a carbon copy of it. \n[*] Good bullet patterns. Like bullets that stick around and home in on you, forcing you to change up your dodging tactics and keep you on your toes. \n[*] Good difficulty levels and great challenge if you want it there.\n[*] Like the focus on perfect wave runs and rewarding you for it. \n[*] Art is sharp, crisp, and it's nice to look at. It's got a chibi like feel to it despite it not being directly affected by a Japanese style. It's the enemies that really stand out. Good changes to bosses as they take damage, looking more worn as the game goes along. \n[*] Game is self aware, and while the writing isn't the greatest, it knows it, and is playing off that. \n[*] Controls work rather well, not too sensitive but not too tight so that you are fighting for it.\n[*] Takes a shot or two at PC culture. I appreciate that.\n[/list]\n\n[b]-:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Certain characters and bullets don't stand out against the background, making those with bad eyesight or troubles with looking at the difference frustrated in getting hit from what seems to be no where.\n[*] Enemy markers warning chose the wrong color to draw attention to it. \n[*] Wish you got a reward for not using bombs.\n[/list]\n", "timestamp_created": 1450456767, "timestamp_updated": 1450456767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.659245", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19707301": {"recommendationid": "19707301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072174860", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503125693}, "language": "english", "review": "Epic Battle Fantasy 4.4 ~ Bullet Heaven 2\n\nSame cast of characters, same cute enemies, same EBF-style music all wrapped up into a nice little Bullet Hell.\n\nPrepare to Die; The End is Nigh o/", "timestamp_created": 1450161341, "timestamp_updated": 1450161690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19697483": {"recommendationid": "19697483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007322380", "num_games_owned": 544, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450097835}, "language": "english", "review": "You can be a cat that shoots stars out of your face.

The game has a huge number of levels (70 total) and even after every level is completed, all the medals and leaderboards are enough to give you a push to do even better. The patterns are gorgeous to look at, and there are a good number of patterns that offer decent challenges. Most patterns feel completely unique, and learning how to beat them all (usually) doesn't end up causing a great deal of frustration, and remains generally fun. There are 19 huge bosses to fight, 40 regular stages to conquer and 11 survival stages to test your abilities with. Beating hard levels is most definitely satisfying, and it's always good to go back and challenge levels time and time again for high scores. All of that added together makes for some of the best times I've had with a bullet hell game, or just games in general.\n\nEDIT: Having now beaten the game and having obtained every achievment in the game, I think I should do a small update to this review. While the game is definitely a lot of fun, it's worth noting that some of the later achievments are only worth attempting if you have a lot of experience, or a lot of patience.  It took me a good 24 hours of gameplay to unlock and beat every level, and another 11 hours to unlock the rest of the achievments I had left.

The game is also a very good Flash port with multiple control schemes (Including controller support) and a wide range of option, including the ability to use high contrast bullets, hide things like score numbers, or cap the frame rate lower for lower end computers.\n\nThe game is responsive and has a surprising amount of depth focused around the scoreboard; handicaps, bonuses, and a variety of mechanics can be used to alter your score to get higher and higher on the very well intergrated scoreboard (something most steam games fail miserably at).\n\nThe art style may not be for everyone, but the bullet patterns are very aesthetic. The music on the other hand is, like Matt's other games, very good with a large variety to match different areas and bosses. The sound design is also nice and work well to punctuate actions like slain enemies and grazed bullets allowing you to focus elsewere.\n\nWhere the game really shines is the sheer amount of content: 3 Difficulties, 8 Characters (Each with multiple costumes and sub-weapons that are all unique to each character), over 70 stages with dozens of bosses. If you were to start on Normal and play through every stage on each difficulty you'd see well over 300 unique waves.\n\nOh, and it's got 4-Player local co-op too, which is really neat.\n\nI suggest this to any Bullet Hell fan looking for something to play and especially anyone looking to get into them.\nNow get to work on EBF5, Matt.", "timestamp_created": 1449969241, "timestamp_updated": 1449969241, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19641606": {"recommendationid": "19641606", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961150231", "num_games_owned": 1346, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480191431}, "language": "english", "review": "I also covered this game on my YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAoCZLFH7PI\n\nI got a review code for this game and had no idea what to expect. I saw it was a shmup which was a plus, a Bullet Hell which was another plus, then I saw it was ported over from Kongregate and I thought like many formerly Flash games, that it'd be a lousy port of a weak game. I couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nI'm terrible at shmups and worse at Bullet Hell games but I love them anyway. I love the thrill of the score chase, the art of the bullet patterns and figuring out the best path through brutal levels. This game has all of that plus an absolutely insane amount of depth, both to the scoring system and to the amount of customisation that's available for your characters and weapons. There are three difficulty levels which can make things accessible to new players but the level of brutally hard you expect from this kind of game. Most arcade shmups are only a handful of levels but this one has over fifty which is crazy, even if they are each rather short. You'll quickly reach a point where things get very tough, even on the lowest difficulty setting so repeated play is encouraged and indeed necessary.\n\nSucceed or fail, you'll earn different amounts of in-game currency which you can use to buy new characters, new weapons and costumes for them which all have benefits and even cheats and handicaps which impact your score when used. This has the major advantage of you still being able to qualify for the leaderboards if you use them. The leaderboard integration is very slick and while it would have been nice to see each difficulty level get its own roster, each level does have its own and you can sort by a variety of means. You're also shown your current position before starting a level and right after you complete it, assuming you're online.\n\nBullet Heaven 2 has a very cutesy/twee aesthetic which really doesn't do much for me but in Bullet Hell games, you don't really have a lot of time to pay attention to the art. If you are, you're kinda' doing it wrong.\n\nThis game is an incredible value for shmup fans and if you are one, you should pick it up without hesitation. It astounds me that this was made by only one person. There are many well regarded shmups with a fraction of the content this has and when I see games like Darius Burst CS coming out for an insane $40+, this is a no brainer.

I've missed many important entries and don't have much to compare this game to (I haven't even played Ikaruga yet, but I plan to!), but I can definitely say I enjoyed it. When I first saw the screenshots for this game, my immediate reaction was one of abject horror and revulsion. But, the screenshots don't do it justice, even videos don't quite translate. It feels incredibly smooth to play!\n\nI've only gotten as far as completing the first of ten worlds, and most of the second. The first world - and I assume, the others as well, - has 2 extra bosses you unlock by clearing levels at a certain rank. I've only beaten one of these optional bosses so far, - the very first one - but I can assure you, they're hard as balls. The game has three difficulty levels; normal, hard, and heavenly. These up the game's pace a bit, and change enemy's bullet patterns, which is most apparent in boss fights.\n\nThere are also various cheats and handicaps you can unlock to customize the difficulty even further, which lower and raise your score by an arbitrary percentage. These include changing bullet speed and damage, but also a few more interesting ones. My favorite was one that keeps bullets persistent between waves, and gives a whopping 20% score boost. I actually found that this handicap improved my performance, as it kept me on my toes at all times.\n\nThe replayability is definitely there, hence how I managed to play until 8 A.M. while only completing one world. Experimenting with the eight different characters and each of their three unique sub-weapons, testing out new cheats/handicaps and difficulty levels, or just trying to up your score to earn new ranks or climb the leaderboard keeps old levels replayable for a very long time.\n\nThe game also supports 4-player local co-op, with keyboard and gamepad controls. It also lets you controls your character by guiding it with the mouse, which works quite well.\n\nAll in all, I found this to be game very fun. If you want to try it out, there is a version on Kongregate. Don't worry if the game is jerky and gives you migraines like it did to me, the Steam version runs much nicer.\nAs an added bonus, this game includes its 20-track soundtrack and some wallpapers for free, which is pretty cool!\n\n(If you like my reviews, I'm posting them all on this hideous Wordpress site now! https://probablysanny.wordpress.com/)", "timestamp_created": 1449735414, "timestamp_updated": 1452054826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19591422": {"recommendationid": "19591422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019048736", "num_games_owned": 908, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1007, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450895210}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm no expert when it comes to bullet hell games.

If you're looking for a good beginner-level Bullet Hell game, this is the one.\n\nA proper Bullet Hell game has the player character shoot a bunch of enemies from a top down perspective, with progressively more (difficult) enemies and progressively more bullets on the screen at once. The player has their hitbox (the part that actually takes damage) visible at all times, and the actual size of their hitbox is always exactly one pixel. So you're actually playing a pixel dodging a bunch of other pixels.\n\nWhat makes this game accessable to everyone is the difficulty. The difficulty scales from pretty easy to unbelievably difficult, and if thats not enough, the ingame \"cheats\" can make your game even easier or even harder.\n\nWhile most Bullet Hell type games force you to use a controller or keyboard with a \"slow down\" button, Bullet Heaven 2 allows users to use a mouse, which makes the game considerably more intuitive especially for beginners to the genre.\n\nYour more skilled friends can join your local co-op game with a controller or with the keyboard. While the campaign is pretty short, playing the campaign again with friends is pretty fun, no matter how skilled they are.\n\nThe biggest downside with this game are it's characters. Bullet Heaven 2's characters come directly from the Epic Battle Fantasy series, and unless you're familiar with that game series, the character dialogs will probably sound a bit cheesy. I do recommend reading the dialogs, as they sometimes contain essentail gameplay information, but if you're interested in getting to know the characters, I recommend playing Epic Battle Fantasy 3 on steam, which is a free game.\n\nAnother downside would be the game engine. Bullet Heaven 2 was built in Flash, which is an excellent engine for the animations in the game, but otherwise very poorly optimized for games. Steam has absolutely no issue running flash, but you might encounter framerate problems if your laptop does not support at least entry level graphics.\n\nTo recap;\n+ Very adjustable difficulty, accessable to everyone\n+ Good starter for those unknown to the Bullet Hell type games\n+ Good support for mouse, controller and keyboard\n+/- Characters aren't properly introduced in this game\n- Runs in flash", "timestamp_created": 1449671149, "timestamp_updated": 1511865642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507584", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19579670": {"recommendationid": "19579670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082363134", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507805325}, "language": "english", "review": "The first bullet heaven was the first bullet hell game I had ever played, although now I've played so many. I liked it so much that I went to the creator's youtube page and asked for a bullet heaven 2. 4 years later, I'm browsing through steam and I see that bullet heaven 2 came out! Imagine my excitement! Thanks for making a second one! \n\nNow to the review: So overall, this is a good bullet hell game. It's especially good, if not perfect, for those who are new to the genre. But there are many unorthodox things about this game which separate it from all other bullet hell games. A few of those things are having a currency to spend things on, the entire stage design, collecting gems, and so forth. It's what would be expected from japanese bullet hell meets american online game maker. Normally in bullet hell games, there's the stage where you fight through countless little guys and then you face the big boss. And there's about 5 or 6 stages which get exponentially more difficult. This game's design is that you fight through many little guys and a few levels of them which are composed of 13 stages each (including bonus stages) until you get to a boss level. It's not arcade-like as in when you lose your lives you have to start all over. The difficulties range from normal to hard to heavenly. And there's room for the absolute beginner all the way to seasoned veteran. There are many things I like about this game such as the scoring mechanism, PRETTY BULLETS!, extra bosses, extra content, online high scores, the music, and all the love that went into perfecting the game. \n\nNow here are a few minor criticisms. The shooting mechanic can drive me a little nuts sometimes. I use keyboard because that's what I'm used to with bullet hell games. And I would absolutely love if I were able to shift+z+x. But I can't. And then if I do x+z and fly around sloppily, it only lets me move right and left. I don't know if this was done on purpose but I don't enjoy that one bit. I was thinking it's possible that maybe that's just my computer so if that's the case, ignore everything I just said. Secondly, going through stage after stage after stage of little guys can get a bit repetative. I don't think there's necessarily a way to avoid that unless a solid mini boss was put in at the end of each level. That would be so much more fun. \n\nOverall, I really love this game and it's so addictive. I would give it a 9/10. Its replayability is much higher than most arcade shooters and I can really see how much attention to detail and effort went into this awesome game!", "timestamp_created": 1449653105, "timestamp_updated": 1449653105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19578497": {"recommendationid": "19578497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220004188", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463715985}, "language": "english", "review": "Kupo/Matt's games only ever get better. Bullet Heaven 2 is no exception. \n\nI personally appreciate how the Bullet Heaven games were inspired by the Touhou Project. \n\nAlso, if you're interested in the game, but unsure if you want to buy it, try out the free web version first. It's available on Kongregate, Armor Games, and Newgrounds. \n\n[h1] Now, on to an actual review.\t[/h1]\n\nThe art style is very charming. I especially like the Pichu/Pikachu slimes. Every character has 4 different costumes. Each costume gives a slight boost of some kind (boost to weapon charge rates, increase in bomb damage, etc.) and somewhat changes the look of the character. Each character also has a unique bomb design. The backgrounds and borders look fantastic. \n\nIn the Steam version, you get a grand total of eight characters. My personal favorites are Matt and Phyrnna.

Everyone who has played Epic Battle Fantasy game series before will enjoy this one too! Even if you don't played EBF before but you like challenges - you must try it!\nVery challenging but also very accessible game, good sense of humour (like in EBF4) and EPIC SOUNDTRACK! This is why I just loved this game so much.\n\nPros:\n- Adjustable difficulty level (3 levels: Normal - very friendly for beginners, Hard - for people loving challenges, and Heavenly - comparable to TouHou games)\n- Cheats and Handicaps to modify difficulty even further\n- Nice patterns, readability\n- Ability to control your character by mouse, keyboard of controller\n- EPIC SOUNDTRACK!\n- Everyone - from beginner to expert shm'up player - will enjoy it ;)\n\nNeutral:\n- No upgrades like in Bullet Heaven (1) - pure Danmaku experience\n- Prize isn't very high for something epic like this, but if you aren't sure about buying it, try flash version first (on Kongregate or Armor Games)\n\nAs for me, it's worth to buy this game - you won't be disappointed.

Amativ.\n\nAnyway, I quite liked this game. That said, this is a very different game from the regular EBF turn-based strategy games. This is a bullet shooter, think \"1945\" or Touhou or Crimson Clover. If you're not a fan of that genre I wouldn't rule this game out entirely, but do play [url=http://www.kongregate.com/games/kupo707/bullet-heaven-2]the free web version[/url] for a few hours - more on that below.\n\nAs for the game itself: it has quite a bit of depth, for just having two or three main mechanics. You can shoot stuff, and you can use a wild card \"bomb\" attack to clear (or almost clear) the screen of enemies. Despite that, almost every level manages to feel distinct thanks to the variety of enemies and bullet patterns. Most of the enemies are making reappearences from past EBF games, and a lot of them have made the transition pretty well, from obvious things like Gunslingers shooting stuff at you to Fire Monster Things blowing burning ash in your face.\n\nYou get eight characters to play: [spoiler]the four protagonists from EBF4, the protagonists' cat \"No Legs,\" a dead version of No Legs, the helpful Slime Bunny and the composer of the game's soundtrack, who kills stuff with musical notes[/spoiler]; each of them have their own unique attack methods and Bomb designs. There are also a couple different \"costumes\" you can give the characters, and a couple different secondary attacks they can use.\n\nIt would be hard to talk about an EBF game without making note of the writing. At the start and end of pretty much every level the main characters exchange a few lines of dialogue, which is usually completely off-the-wall and decently helpful at the same time. The descriptions of achievements and whatnot also tend to be quite colorful. Expect fourth wall breaks. True to form, the writing does not take itself too seriously. (Also, it's available in a bunch of different languages.)\n\nDifficulty . . . if you're a Touhou veteran you probably won't have too hard a time with this, but on higher difficulties it's quite easy to get yourself into spaces where you only have one or two pixels where it's safe to move without getting hit. If that's too much, or not enough, you have quite a bit of control over the difficulty: there are three tiers of bullet density, and a bunch of bonuses/handicaps you can buy with in-game money and enable and disable to make the game way easier or way harder.\n\nThe art style. It's pretty. It's . . . really pretty. Scroll up to the top of the store page and look at the screenshots.\n\nYou can even grab a friend and play local co-op with up to four people, but those aren't something I have a whole lot of so I'm going to assume that feature's really good, too. Regardless of whether or not you have any IRL friends, you can control the game with the mouse, the keyboard or a dedicated game controller.\n\nPerformance: a few people have reported lag, but I'm basically running this on a college essay machine (see below) and so far, I've seen no lag even with all of the graphical effects turned on and bullet density set to Heavenly. The optimization is amazing, if you have any performance issues they should be decently simple to fix.\n\n[h1]Differences between this and the Web version[/h1]\n - All \"premium content\" is automatically available, with the base game, no microtransactions, no questions asked, no nothing. Unlock it the same way you'd unlock any other character or stage in the game. Seriously, [spoiler]you get to play as the composer of the soundtrack and attack stuff with musical notes, maybe not the best but easily my favorite.[/spoiler]\n - Leaderboards. You can now see how your scores stack up against everyone elses' scores [strike]and walk away scratching your head at how people manage seven digits on World 1-1[/strike].\n - Steam Achievements that unlock in parallel with the in-game achievements. Again, if you're a completionist . . . these are not easy, some of them you can grind out but a lot of them rely on a considerable level of bullet shooter skill. You have been warned.\n - Steam trading cards. Come on, those things look adorable.\n - Better performance. Like, WAY better performance.\n - The OST as a free DLC. If you've listened to more than about three minutes of the in-game music, I don't think I have to explain this, but [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/DragoniteSpam/recommended/419210]here[/url] is my review on that anyway.\n\n[h1]Computer[/h1]\nIntel i7 @2.6 GHz\n8 GB RAM\nIntel HD Graphics\nWindows 8.1\n\nAgain, no lag even with the graphics on full blast.

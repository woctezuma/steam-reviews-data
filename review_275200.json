Decent story with several endings based on certain questline completions/actions. There is a bit of replayability because of the 3 unlockable characters and a few incompatible questlines. Combat is only done horizontally; you (and your opponents) can only shoot left/right. It means that you do a lot of up/down dodging and jostling for position.\n\nIt took me a few tries to get into it because I didn't like certain aspects of the game. When you die you lose half your money and until you finish the game you won't know how important money is. I restarted/stopped playing after a death because I didn't know how the game worked. Money is not a limited resource: you can earn money by grinding \"Wanted\" posters, collecting them on the ground, doing a certain bull quest, or as a reward for other quests. Money is used to purchase hats (you store up to 3 hats for 3 lives), weapons (you hold up to 3), clothing (just visual), and (the big thing) certain quests.\n\nAlso, I didn't like that it uses an autosave system (no manual saving). I would have greatly preferred to have free control over saves, using save slots for key moments and to see how choices mattered without replaying the whole game over again each time. Eventually I found out that you can manually 'save scum' using the actual save files but it's an extra hassle the devs wanted for some reason.\n\nThe world is a bit overwhelming at first because it's an open world and you're directionless but after you've played the game you know where things are and where the quest givers/targets are and the world is smaller than it seems. Most of the civilians walking around town only say flavor text and there are a limited amount of important locations (the rest is travel filler/scenery with angry bandits/money/quest collectibles).\n\nIt's worth a look if you like horizontal shooters and doing an adventure (doing quests with the goal of finding your family's murderer) set in the Wild West.\n\nOther thoughts:[list]\n[*] This is an (apparently greatly) expanded and polished version of the free game you can play on Adult Swim's website. It's worth looking at that as a demo to see if you'd be interested in this.\n[*] It's a little annoying that 'bandits' who try to shoot you on sight when you get close are apparently counted as civilians and count towards one of the endings. You're only 'allowed' to shoot those on wanted posters.\n[*] It's nice that there are multiple endings.\n[*] Scorpions and angry dogs are the real scourge of the Wild West. I've had followers randomly die to them while I was just trying to get to the next screen. Humans who have to pause an aim don't hold a candle to them.\n[*] Bullets pierce and travel off-screen. This means you need to force your target to the edge of the screen and fire towards the edge if you don't want to randomly kill a bystander.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1518391237, "timestamp_updated": 1518393455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39983098": {"recommendationid": "39983098", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971598302", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483130088}, "language": "english", "review": "bang.", "timestamp_created": 1518286337, "timestamp_updated": 1518286337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457369", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39980349": {"recommendationid": "39980349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007688772", "num_games_owned": 779, "num_reviews": 344, "playtime_forever": 1701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518278099}, "language": "czech", "review": "Skv\u011bl\u00fd mal\u00fd open-world, ve kter\u00e9m hr\u00e1\u010dovy rozhodnut\u00ed skute\u010dn\u011b maj\u00ed n\u011bjakou v\u00e1hu.

Certain requests you get from townspeople that might give you a clue are mutually exclusive, leading to entirely different outcomes, and the game has systems in place to take into account all of these things. It's honestly pretty fantastic. \n\nThat, and there's just a lot of weird sidequests you can do, for fun, and the precious cash you'll need to finish other quests, get guns, and play dressup with different outfits.\n\nCombat itself can be a bit tricky to get used to, since you need to aim and cock your weapon before you fire- and the fast movement you'll need to move out of the way of enemies (Who also function by these same rules), will throw off your aim. It makes it challenging in an enjoyable way, however- and the game's forgiving enough to give you a grand total of 4 hits you can soak (3 'hats' which somehow absorb bullets), before you reach critical mass - and which can be replenished by shooting off the hats of enemies.\n\nTl;DR. I will happily recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1515897047, "timestamp_updated": 1515897047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39322609": {"recommendationid": "39322609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079807830", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514940933}, "language": "english", "review": "Westerado is adorable, surprisingly deep and fully featured, and heaps of fun to play. I think it's popularity has been hampered by the $15 price mark and the 3 hour playtime. Don't be fooled. This is a game that was made to be played more than once. The soundtrack and pixel art are fantastic and the sheer amount of content crammed into this little title is enough to make big studio open world games blush.

You take on the role of a gunslinger who is tasked with hunting down his families killer. \n\nThe way in which you complete this task differs from other games in my view; you have to find clues about the identity of the culprit by completing missions and objectives for locals around the towns. This really adds to the mystery behind the killer. Even the options menu has a screen dedicated to showing you all the clues you have found along with a model of a character showing the clues on, such as a \"fat, blue shirt, medium sized hat\" figure for example. These clues are all randomly generated each playthrough as well. \n\nAnother really new feature in Westerado is the that you can draw your gun at anytime, even during a conversion with any NPC, this can sometimes trigger a different set of dialogue, initiate a new quest, or just go completely wrong and end up in a gun fight. This also means you can kill anyone in the story too, no matter how important they are to the plot, anyone can die.\n\nThe main gameplay is a top down action game, in good old western style, you have your gun which you have to manually reload every six shots, or you can upgrade it to a big ol shotgun. The gunfights can sometimes feel a little bit clunky, but once you get used to the controls and how the game responds to them, it soon becomes clear and easily executed. Another one of my favorite parts of the game would be the buffalo scenes; riding horse back defending carriages from bandits on a buffalo's, although simple, it is really compelling to play.\n\nWesterado has a very clever story, and has all the main plot points that any good western film will have in it. Although you can make the story different each time you play, for instance just killing one of the main quest givers, I am not sure it actually changes the whole outcome of the game, I think all that will happen is you'll just miss out on those quests rather it have an effect on the grand scheme of things. \n\nThe world in which you play in is huge, it's set out like a very Zelda style map, each tile on the map has four entry points, north, west, south and east. This makes navigating across the map very easy and you can always make your way to where you need to be very quickly. Each of the zones look amazing too; lots of detail has gone into adding plenty of objects, background items and scenery to add to the western feel.

In wieweit \nsich das aber auf Gegner oder deren \nSchwierigkeitsgrad auswirkt wei\u00df ich nicht.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nGrafik:\n\nDie Grafik ist ganz OK, leider h\u00e4tte ich mir bei \nGespr\u00e4chen und beim Pokern etwas mehr Details\ngew\u00fcnscht.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nMusik:\n\nDie Musik ist sehr gut gemacht, und passt immer\nsehr zur jeweiligen Situation. Hier steckt wirklich \nviel Herzblut drin.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nSteuerung:\n\nDie Steuerung mit dem XBOX 360 Pad war einfach \nsuper.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPro/Contra:\n\n+ Super sch\u00f6n inszeniert \n+ Super Musik\n+ sch\u00f6ne K\u00e4mpfe\n+ Entscheidungsfreiheit\n- kein deutscher Untertitel\n- sehr schweres Englisch\n- keine Coop mit Gamepad und Tastatur\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nFazit:\n\nEin wirklich cooles kurzes Game, was man sicherlich \n\u00f6fter mal spielen kann um zu sehen was man h\u00e4tte \nanders machen k\u00f6nnen. Leider gibt es keine \nDeutsche \u00dcbersetzung von dem Spiel und geplant \nist auch keine was wirklich schade ist. \n\nDas Englisch was hier geschrieben wird ist kein \neinfaches Englisch sondern hat wirklich viel Slang \nmit drin den man mit wenig Englisch Kenntnissen \nnur schwer bis gar nicht zu verstehen ist. \nMan wird es sicherlich durchspielen k\u00f6nnen aber \nviele Nebenquest wird man nicht verstehen und \nabschlie\u00dfen k\u00f6nnen.\n\nWer es dennoch probieren will, es ist ein Super \nGame was einfach gestrickt ist und viel Potenzial hat.\n\nIch bereue es nicht es gespielt zu haben, nur es \naber leider zu wenig verstanden zu haben.\nIch hoffe das es noch einen zweiten Teil geben \nwird und dann hoffentlich mit deutscher \u00dcbersetzung. \n\nIch habe circa 8 \u00bd Stunden gebraucht um es \ndurchzuspielen und habe nicht alle Quest \nabgeschlossen. Die Hauptstory kann man in \ncirca 1 Stunde abschlie\u00dfen habe ich auf YouTube \ngesehen, und wenn man alles versteht denke ich \ndas man in circa 5 Stunden es komplett \ndurchspielen kann.\n\n14,99\u20ac finde ich etwas zu teuer f\u00fcr dieses sehr \nkurze Game aber im Bundle oder f\u00fcr ein paar Euro \nkann man es schon mal mitnehmen.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nZusammengefasst: \n\nEinzelspieler: 8/10\nMehrspieler: 5/10\nGrafik: 8/10\nMusik: 10/10\nSteuerung:

Sure, Red Dead Redemption or Call of Juarez show vibrant 3D worlds packed with action, but I did not miss any of it while playing the game of Ostrich Bandidos.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was how easy and immediate is to simply draw the gun and kill an NPC; the second was to realize that this often leads to an irreversible loss of an optional quest. It may bother some, but this is freedom in its purest form: you can do virtually anything withing the constraints of the gameplay, as long as you accept that those actions will have consequences. And these are not necessarily bad, since it is always possible to reach the end of the game -- only completionists will have to be extra careful not to skip any secondary quest.\n\nAnd the rest... you should see for yourself. Don\u00b4t be put off by the retro graphics, which look surprisingly ok after the first half hour, or by the limited range of options.

Features a lot of corny western movie jokes, unlockable characters and an okay co-op.  The combat is very easily exploitable, but you do have access to a variety of weapons and hat-shotting is satisfying and useful.  There's also the occasional minigame that's functional but nothing too exciting.\n\nBasically once you get tired of shooting people at the most ridiculous times you can find you'll probably need to restart to finish the main quest and whatever other sidequests you wish.  This won't take especially long, and the other modes are just more of the same- and 2 player isn't good enough to warrant the purchase just for that.

Simple gameplay and giving the player the power to go through the game leisurely make for a fun time. I went in not expecting much and the game got hooked for the entire playthrough.\n\nSoundtrack\nWhen it comes to sound design all I ask of games like this, is to go with what's happening on screen and set an appropriate tone. Westerado does this and then goes further. Making enjoyable sounding music to accompany the game throughout. Although all talk is text they do get the sound effects on point to balance it out. Thanks to the sounds shootin' yer guns feels satisfying as ever.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay as stated before is quite simple and yet it is so effective at inducing fun. You have a large 'open' world with plenty of places to visit and even tasks that you must complete to get to some of them. Or you can choose to ignore it all and follow you're main objective which is not related to any of it. Your main objective is figuring out who murdered your family and burned down your ranch. The game leaves that person up to RNG. It's a guess who approach. The murderser's appearance is randomized and you must complete quests or speak with certain people to gain small clues as to who it was. It can be done quickly or it can be done as you please. Either way after a short tutorial what you decide to do before you find your man can result in very different endings. The variation is surprising here and well done. Combat is a highlight. You can move, run, draw your gun, and shoot. The shooting requires you to line up your gun horizontally with an enemy onscreen. And it can be hectic at times but once you get the hang of it you'll likely have no troubles. One of the best parts is you can walk up to anyone and perform any of these actions on them as well. It's funny you have the power to interrupt anyones dialog by drawing your gun. I really enjoyed this freedom. More games need this kind of approach.\n\nStory\nThe story is about revenge, love, greed, and guns. That is if you're counting the sidequests. Becasue the main story is as simple as previously described. You can engage with all of it or none of it. Someone take away your home and family from you and you seek revenge. There really isn't much more to say. \n\nGraphics\nThe pixel art is fantastic and it was a great choice for this game. Made for some really great moods in certain locations and fits with the rest of the game's simplicity. \n\nI would recommend this easily. I thought it was just one of those games to play when you're up for wasting time but I was pleasently surprised by what this game had to offer. Pick it up, it's a fair price and delivers lots of fun and variation.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1510886899, "timestamp_updated": 1511463527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36526907": {"recommendationid": "36526907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198380791703", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492502267}, "language": "schinese", "review": "666", "timestamp_created": 1510733075, "timestamp_updated": 1510733075, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36505350": {"recommendationid": "36505350", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153460584", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508468299}, "language": "english", "review": "I've never written a review for any game before, but I feel like I have to say something about Westerado. It's one of the best indie games I've played in a while, and even though I got it in a bundle, I'd say it's worth it at full price. From the moment I started Westerado up, I was hooked.\n\nThe story deals with you figuring out who murdered your family and burned down your ranch. The murderer's appearance is randomized every time, and each game, you complete quests to get clues as to his appearance. You can do this fairly quickly; it only took me a couple hours to beat my first playthrough. \n\nWhat really sets the game apart, though, is how replayable this simple premise is. The complexity is in how the world reacts to you. It's got a quasi-open world map, in which you can go anywhere on the map and talk to and shoot anyone at any time. This can actually lock off certain endings and quests, and doing certain questlines also locks off other questlines, making it impossible to see everything the game has in one playthrough.\n\nThe gameplay is simple but extremely satisfying. You can move, run, draw your gun, and shoot. The shooting is fairly simple; it only requires you to line up your gun horizontally with an enemy onscreen. However, the gunplay is immensely satisfying, due to the simple controls and the outstanding sound effects. I really can't stress enough how good it feels to play this game. I've only playing using a keyboard, but a controller should work just fine as well, since there's only a few buttons needed aside from movement.\n\nWesterado also really nails the western movie aesthetic; the world they've created, the interactions you have with it, and the characters within it feel lifted out of a movie, and there are actually a few fourth-wall breaking moments that allude to this fact.\n\nIf you're looking for something unique to play, don't pass Westerado up.

So, you run around helping people to find out clues about the killer and you will find out tidbits about what he is wearing (pants, hat, shirt, etc).  Once you have all of your information, you can look for him in the towns and train stations to find him, chase him, and kill him.  There are a lot of side quests, the combat is simple but fun, and there is a good amount of humor referencing hats and the western/southern accent (I is always pronounced \"Ah\" with the main character, as in \"Ah'll see what Ah can do.\")  The game is also fun to rivisit from time to time since it is such a short playthrough, but depending on how you play different things can happen plus the killer is always randomized.\n\nGreat game, very short, feel free to get it on a sale.

To find the killer and bring him to justice. You go around an open world completeing little jobs or missions for people in exchange for items or sometimes clues. The game is not linear and it is up to you how you want to go about completing the game. \n\nThe game is published by Adult Swim, but don't let that put you off. I'm sure many other people who are older (30+) see Adult Swim and automatically think obnoxious and immature game, like their shows, but that is not the case here. The game doesn't take itself TOO seriously, but the little humor it does have isn't over the top stupid like you'd expect from Adult Swim. \n\nThe controls themselves are good, and the interface works well. The only down side, and I guess this is a big one, is the combat. All shooting is done left and right. Don't get me wrong, this doesn't ruin the game, it just makes fire fights feel a little less meaningful. \n\nOne of the cool parts of the game, aside from the fact you can talk to every single NPC in the game, is that during conversations you can literally point yout gun at the person your talking to's face. Sometimes that will make them stop talking to you. Sometimes it will make them run. Sometimes it will make them attack. Sometimes it will make them give you their money because they think you're robbing them. And sometimes they will give you a clue about the killer. \n\nThe game itself isn't very long, about 4 hours. However, there is infinite replayability in the sense that every time you start a new game, it's a brand new killer. So if you bought the game and enjoyed it, you shouldn't feel dread whern you complete the storyline, because you can just do it all over again and huint a new killer. \n\nPlus the fact you can shoot and kill anyone in the game is always nice when you're craving some \"GTA like\" blood lust. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this game. I do think the $14.99 is a little high considering the length of the game and the fact that not everyone will want to replay it. I think 9.99 is a more appropriate price.

My major problem with the game is that it is \u00a310 (I bought it in the summer sale) which is overpriced I'd say if it was \u00a35 it would be a good cost. Another problem is I got lucky and acidently finished the game in 25 minutes. (because I randomly saw the killer in a town and i chased him down) Another problem is I think the pull out gun at any time is a nice feature but if you do this to a few specific characters you can't do their quest and you need to do their quest to get info on the killer.

I must admit that I found the story and gameplay rather entertaining, and the characters and stories amusing.\n\nMy only gripe about this game, and the reason I'm writing a review at all, is to warn future players -- be VERY careful playing this game! Although it's not obvious, this is a game where choices matter. This can be EXTREMELY frustrating sometimes, because simple mistakes can screw up major plot elements.\n\nFor example, when I was just figuring out how to move around and shoot stuff, I accidentally fired my gun inside of the town store. So the storekeeper and the assistant started firing back at me. I ultimately prevailed, but alas, they died. And as a result, I was unable to buy any weapons for the entire game! At least I got pretty good with the pistol, but still, this sucks. Such major mistakes should either be made impossible (ie, not allowing the character to shoot in certain places) or undoable. I ran into a number of other cases where people accidentally died (sometimes not even by me!) and this screwed up quests or other storylines. However, this doesn't affect your ability to continue playing the game, which is good.\n\nOh yeah, and the other thing... the poker AI is ridiculously stupid, which makes earning money quite easy, assuming you know the basics of the game. The secret to winning is: [spoiler]play conservatively until you have a good hand, then bet hard. The computer players never, ever fold.

The high yet forgiving difficulty levels give a great sense of adrenaline during shootouts with bandits, and make your victories all the more satisfying.  When you die, the game does a great job of handling the way you respawn, deducting half your cash rather than completely robbing you of all your posessions and progress.  The soundtrack is excellent, further enhancing the rustic western theme.  I personally don't feel like there are enough good wild west games(Call of Juarez is fun though), and this game manages to help fill that gap.  I'd give this a solid 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1502468163, "timestamp_updated": 1502468163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count":

I also like the new hats and colors of clothing. My two Biggest complaints are that doubletap sprinting was not included, and that Scorpions take two shots most of the time and eat up most of my hat supply as about 40% of my hats are destroyed by Scorpions. I however Still love that NPCs can suffer Scorpion attacks as well. In my playthrough, I decided to go out and see if the horde mode was still in the game, and was impressed by the AI as it was far better and didn't run away as soon as I shot their hat (somtimes). soon after, I was dead and as I was on the permadeath gamemode, game overed. Also, you can pull out your gun while talking to people which is pretty darn cool if ah do say so mahself. I am well on my way to getting all the endings and so far have done very well.

These clues are always different for every playthrough/run.\n+ Non-replayable quests - Most of the quests don't allow you to retry. So, if you screw up during a quest (e.g. killed an ally, failing the quest), you gotta live with the consequences and move on.\n+ Gun mechanics - This keeps the game interesting as you gotta wield your gun, cock and shoot it manually. Protip: don't panic during a shootout or you might accidentally holster your gun instead of shooting.\n+ Great music - Nice western music playing in the background! What more could you ask for?\n+ Replayability value - The villain and his reason for murdering your family will always be different in each playthrough. Additionally, there are 4 playable characters with distinct aesthetics and traits.\n+ Western dialogue - Dialogues are written in western \"accent\". For some people, this may be good (since the setting is in the Wild West), or... (see Cons)\n\nCons:\n- Journal system - The journal system is pretty good, albeit the quest tracking system on the map. It shows where you need to go to complete quests, but every marker is just an exclamation mark, with no indication which quest it refers to. Protip: Always do quests 1 by 1; never start another quest unless you've finished the previous one. This reduces the amount of exclamation marks on your map.\n- Hat types - It seems that all hats are functionally similar despite the prices being different; some are more expensive than the others. This excludes the miner's hat which has a flashlight that makes mine exploring possible.\n- Western dialogue - non-English players may find the dialogues somewhat difficult to understand, especially if the sentences are long; you may find yourself skipping dialogues sometimes, which is not very good given the fact that the journal system might be rather confusing.\n- 30 FPS lock - Seems like the FPS is locked to 30 and I haven't found a way to raise it to 60. No cancer will be cured.\n\nOthers (can be Pro or Con, depending on your perspective):\n* No manual saving - The game autosaves everything. So, if you fail a quest, for example, you can't retry it by loading a previous save.\n* No post-end game - Despite the game being open world and explorable with many quests, once you reach the ending, you gotta start a fresh game.\n\nOverall:\nWesterado: Double Barreled is a very good game with pretty high replayability value. It's definitely recommended for western video game fans. Is it worth the full price? Yes, except you're the kind of player who's satisfied after reaching one ending and doesn't replay the whole game for different ones, or just too lazy to get achievements. When discounted?

While that description might seem a long game, is actually pretty short letting you replay with different approaches. Combined with unlockable characters, is a game that will last a bit more of a weekend.\n\nWhile the premise of high replay value with different ways to play the game is already quite solid, seems the game lacks polishing in various aspects. There's friendly fire that either allows you to exploit certain fights against several enemies, or take damage from a NPC assisting you (Don't know if this also happens in co-op). This follows with the scorpions being the real threat of the game, as there might be some cases that can stack several hits if the group together. And obviously due the open nature to play the quests, some of them might become impossible to complete in a blind run.\n\nHowever, what really bothered me the most is the graphics. Sprite characters are very plain and made of a few pixels, something a lot of indie devs fall into. But the areas look fantastic, and if the characters had a bit more detail the game overall it could've been more appealing to play.\n\nOverall, although some big flaws in my opinion, is a great game to play and beat in a few hours.

You're a wild west gunslinger who lost your family to a violent and terrible murderer. By playing minigames and completing quests for townsfolk, you unlock pieces of the murderer's description. The neat thing is that the murderer IS different every time. Not only that, but the murderer's motivations are different based on how you play the game and how extensively you explored the world.\n\nIt's a pretty big world for what the game is. Essentially you have a pair of frontier towns, a Union fort, Indian lands, desert, and an extensive network of underground dungeons. The side quests are all pretty fun in their own right due to a variety in compeletion. Not every quest is a shootout, some are dialouge based, some are travel based, some are item based. It's realy nice how much they've done with such simple mechanics. One of my favorite aspects of Westerado is that it can be completed in anywhere between 5 minutes and 3 hours. There's a ton of stuff to do, but if you just want to capture the murderer you can do that too.\n\nWhat I really really appreciate is that no matter what quest-line you choose, they all lead to the same road. You learn information about the murderer after completing every quest. This means that every side-quest becomes a main quest in that it furthers your overall goal. That is a masterstroke of story telling and, when paired with achievements not only allows players to explore every single opportunity, but encourages it. \n\nCombat can be a little confusing at first, but you'll quickly get the hang of it. Every time you start a fight, you have to draw your weapon, cock your pistol, then fire. Though you'll quickly learn how to shoot enemies and avoid the different kinds of gunfire, the game deploys a few side enemies (scorpions, lassoing enemies, Indians, and coyotes) who mix things up just enough to always keep you on your toes. However, what I love most about the combat is that in any conversation you always have the option of raising your gun, cocking your gun, and firing. That's a simple, but neat idea that I'd love to see in more RPGs. \n\nIn addition to the gameplay itself, the pixel art here is absolutley stunning. The bright oranges, the rocks, the birds, the coyotes...everything looks fantastic. Though most of the game is isometric, the developers wisely put in a few side-scrolling vistas to show off what they've done with a pallete of 3 shades of yellow and 2 shades of orange. It's seriously impressive and I'm honestly glad I collected trading cards for Westerado because now I have these wonderful background images.\n\nMy one and only caveat is that this game retails for $14.99. I had a lot of fun with it, but I feel this is more of a $5 game. \nAdult Swim Games has really pulled it out with this one.

If you're like me, you'll find the description pretty quickly, but it's too much fun to go through the storylines of the many factions peppered throughout the game to stop once you know who the killer is.

One playthrough only need about 2-3 hours (there's even an achievement if you can do it in under 1 hour), but the short playthrough is the point of the game as it is meant to be replayed.\n\nIn this kind of genre, you pick one main questline, go through it, take some small sidequests along the way, and begin the next playthrough soon after. The point of the game is to do stuff, make mistakes, finish the game, then do it again with different possibilities. For example, if you chose to pick the oil tycoon questline, you can't do the farmer questline because they are in the opposing side of the story. \n\nLike Way of the Samurai, Westerado gives you a lot of player freedom. It's not just your words that decide where the story goes, but also your action. If someone refuse to answer your request, you can aim your gun to threaten them. Once an NPC fears you, they might not want to talk with you again; but in some other time violence is the only answer, as some questlines are only unlockable when you force your way through.\n\nThe combat takes a while to figure out, but once you get the hang of it, it shouldn't be too hard to master. The game allows you to bring partners (through recruitable NPCs and local co-op), but often combat gets too hectic and you can find your friends (or yourself) lie dead from friendly fire.\n\nThe game's soundtrack is easily my favorite; pretty memorable and manage to evoke the lone feeling of Wild West.\n\nUnlike Way of the Samurai, though, character customization isn't the greatest in the game. There are four playable characters (three are unlockables) and you can change the color of your outfit, but that's it. Also, unlike Way of the Samurai, some questlines can actually be mix and matched if you talk to the right person in the right time (which can result to oddly hilarious result, like you being a the oil tycoon henchman while at the same time are regarded as a good man by the Indians - whose lands are robbed by the tycoon).\n\nOverall though, this is a pretty enjoyable game.

Ces indices s'obtiendront en aidant diff\u00e9rentes personnes de bien des mani\u00e8res : tuer des bandits, prot\u00e9ger un convoi, lib\u00e9rer des bisons, etc... Il y a largement de quoi faire, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il y a bien plus de qu\u00eates que d'indices \u00e0 r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer. Le jeu est ainsi potentiellement tr\u00e8s court lorsqu'on effectue les qu\u00eates les plus courtes (1 \u00e0 2h de jeu), mais rien ne vous emp\u00eache d'explorer de fond en comble le vaste monde \u00e0 la recherche de tous les secrets. Le contenu total est assez cons\u00e9quent, et il y a aussi trois persos jouables \u00e0 d\u00e9bloquer (amenant un gameplay diff\u00e9rent).

Vous pouvez par exemple tuer n'importe quel PNJ, y compris les plus importants, et quand m\u00eame arriver \u00e0 vos fins. Au contraire, il est possible de tuer un minimum de gens en choisissant des voies plus diplomatiques.

Avec de l'argent, vous pourrez acheter d'autres armes comme un shotgun ou un fusil. Par contre, il n'est possible de tirer qu'horizontalement, et la hitbox des ennemis (notamment ces saloperies de scorpions) n'est pas toujours tr\u00e8s claire. L'ing\u00e9nieux syst\u00e8me de points de vie est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par des chapeaux : si vous vous fa\u00eetes toucher alors que vous avez un chapeau, vous restez en vie ; mais si vous vous fa\u00eetes toucher alors que vous n'avez pas de chapeau, c'est la mort. En visant bien, vous pouvez tirer sur les chapeaux de vos ennemis afin de les r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer (et d'\u00e9pargner des vies par la m\u00eame occasion).\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 graphique, les d\u00e9cors sont franchements tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s beaux, le chara-design est un peu sp\u00e9cial mais clair et efficace.

Going around chatting with people, snagging up quests of sorts while wandering aimlessly. Given a lot more freedom than most games (even nowadays)...\n\nWesterado is like that. Albeit not as deep. Not as flexible, and no need to worry about Radscorpions (though watch out for their more \"normal\" overly aggressive kind).\n\nWhat is here is a good game. The visuals you'll either love or hate (I loved the graphics in a game called Master of Monsters on the Genesis) and you ultimately have one goal. Find dat dem killer (as a southern boy I signed a contract in the womb stating I can type and speak in such language, it's actually a requirement in the south much like signing up for the draft).\n\nThe basic idea is to find the killer ala Clue style. You gather this information by doing quests for people and/or just talking to random people. So when you first start you might now have many details but could get lucky and find the killer (though I believe it's random each time) or spend your time exploring the world and doing quests at your leisure.\n\nVery small assortment of weapons but each plays differently. Espeically the bola which is a fairly easy way to capture bounties alive without risking the hat thing. You can also switch between them, so don't fret.\n\nOh ya, hat thing. Hats are health. You die when you have no more hats to put on. Good thing is, hats can be picked up from the dirty rotten scoundrels or innocent folk you shoot. Or you could be boring and just buy them.\n\nQuests are varied. Ya you get \"go here and shoot x\" but you also have side scrolling buffalo guardin rootin and tootin shootin. Bounties, as stated above, normally allow you the option to take a target alive or dead or just one or the other.\n\nThey also have a part where you can either follow the armies orders and shoot the injuns or attempt to broker peace with'em.\n\nAlso you can rob the bank.\n\nDo it.\n\nBecause I said. So ya, snag this if it's on sale because it adds replay value by providing many different characters. I beat this in 3 hours, though I could have done it quicker. I also missed out on a few quests though and didn't play any of the other unlocked characters.\n\nLastly, talk to the chiefs brother 4 times for a special gift!

L'aspetto blocky di una pixel art volutamente lontana dalla perfezione cela in realt\u00e0 un gioco pi\u00f9 profondo di quanto possiamo immaginare, che coniuga meccaniche shooter con un'esplorazione open-world - il tutto rimanendo fedele ad una filosofia indie come sempre votata a produrre titoli semplici ed altamente giocabili.\n\nIl gioco ci vede nei panni del figlio minore di una famiglia di allevatori nel vecchio, selvaggio West. Un giorno ci allontaniamo da casa sulle tracce di un bufalo fuggito dal nostro ranch, e al nostro ritorno ritroviamo la fattoria in fiamme, nostra madre accasciata a terra senza vita e nostro fratello ferito a morte. Prima di passare a miglior vita, con le ultime forze il ragazzo ci fornir\u00e0 un indizio sul misterioso assassino: a questo punto inizier\u00e0 una caccia senza sosta che ci porter\u00e0 a viaggiare in lungo e in largo per trovare indizi che ci avvicineranno a lui, per cercare di placare infine la nostra sete di vendetta.\n\nWDB \u00e8 in sostanza un piccolo, minuscolo sandbox in cui potremo esplorare liberamente le zone circostanti interagendo in (relativa) libert\u00e0 con gli individui in cui ci imbatteremo. Sia chiaro, non stiamo paragonando Westerado agli ultimi GTA, Fallout o Far Cry: le zone esplorabili non sono enormi, e i viaggi da un punto all'altro della mappa durerano al massimo un minuto o poco pi\u00f9 (molto di meno se utilizzermeno il cavallo). Tuttavia rimane l'inconfondibile piacere dell'esplorazione libera, e il gran numero di missioni diverse che potremo intraprendere renderanno l'avventura sempre appagante e mai banale.\n\nLo scopo del gioco nelle sue fasi iniziali sar\u00e0 quello di viaggiare fino alla vicina citt\u00e0 di Clintville per parlare con lo sceriffo dell'assalto avvenuto e cercare di raccogliere ulteriori indizi sull'assassino della nostra famiglia. La citt\u00e0 brulica di persone, e tra queste troveremo diversi NPC disposti ad affidarci missioni di diverso tipo in cambio di informazioni preziose per la nostra caccia all'uomo. Una volta completata una missione otterremo un'indicazione sull'abbigliamento del fuorilegge: piano piano i tratti distintivi della sua figura si faranno sempre pi\u00f9 chiari e definiti - ad esempio un cappello largo, una cintura con borchia argentea, la bandana colorata, ecc. - e questo ci permetter\u00e0 di individuarlo in mezzo alla gente e smascherarlo.\n\nLa bellezza di questa meccanica, che mi ha subito riportato alla mente le partite ad Indovina Chi? di qualche decennio fa in compagnia dei compagni di scuola, \u00e8 che ad ogni partita l'aspetto dell'assassino viene generato randomicamente, rendendo di fatto ogni run diversa dalla precedente. La rigiocabilit\u00e0 \u00e8 un aspetto essenziale di WDB: le partite difficilmente dureranno pi\u00f9 di un paio d'ore, e con tutta probabilit\u00e0 non avrete bisogno di completare TUTTE le missioni secondarie per riuscirete a identificare il colpevole. Con un playthrough successivo potremo quindi seguire una o pi\u00f9 questline che non avevate intrapreso nel precedente (per scelta o per necessit\u00e0, visto che alcune sono mutuamente esclusive), aumentando decisamente la longevit\u00e0 generale del titolo.\n\nHo parlato fino ad ora delle meccaniche generali... ma che gioco western sarebbe se non avessimo a disposizione un arsenale di tutto rispetto per farci strada a suono di piombo tra banditi e fuorilegge? Su questo fronte WDB ci propone una selezione di armi standard da cowboy, tra cui potremo trovare revolver (la nostra arma di partenza), fucili, carabine e persino bolas e tomahawk, ciascuna con caratteristiche e pregi/difetti differenti. Tutte le armi condivideranno la modalit\u00e0 di utilizzo: sar\u00e0 infatti necessario dapprima estrarre l'arma, e in seguito caricare e fare fuoco - il tutto tenendo sempre d'occhio il caricatore, per evitare di trovarsi senza proiettili nei momenti pi\u00f9 \"caldi\" del confronto. \n\nPotendo far fuoco solo orizzontalmente bisogner\u00e0 fare molta attenzione ai movimenti di avvicinamento dei nemici - passatemi il paragone azzardato, \u00e8 un po' come nei vecchi Golden Axe/Doubel Dragon, in cui le sovrapposizioni coi nemici e gli avvicinamenti richiedevano molta attenzione. La barra vitale \u00e8 sostituita in WDB da una serie di tre \"cappelli\", acquistabili in citt\u00e0 negli appositi store o recuperabili dai nemici morti: ogni colpo subito ci far\u00e0 perdere un cappello e, una volta rimasti senza, ogni singolo priettile potr\u00e0 spedirci al creatore. \n\nDal punto di vista grafico, il gioco \u00e8 completamente bidimensionale con visule isometrica ed una pixel art che riesce a soddisfare pur senza esibire un livello di dettagli particolarmente fine: anzi, durante le conversazioni con gli NPC la scena verr\u00e0 zoomata e potremo apprezzare in tutto il loro splendore i macroblocchi di pixel che compongono le figure. E' una direzione artistica diametralmente opposta al trend degli indie attuali che cercano la perfezione nei songoli pixel di ogni sprite, ma non si pu\u00f2 certo dire che il risultato finale non sia piacevole. Altrettanto godibili sono le tracce audio country, in cui l'armonica si prende il giusto ruolo di protagonista: il materiale \u00e8 tutto molto orecchiabile e perfettamente centrato rispetto all'ambientazione generale.\n\nDunque, ricapitoliamo. Siete amanti della grafica retr\u00f2 e sapete chiudere un occhio davanti a blocchi cubitali di pixel? Non disdegnate un po' di esplorazione e sentite il bisogno, di tanto in tanto, di una sana sparatoria? Siete cresciuti a pane e Sergio Leone e vi credete pi\u00f9 fighi di Lee Van Cleef quando maneggiate una pistola? E allora cosa aspettate: correte ad installare WDB, sellate il cavallo, armate i revolver e lanciatevi subito alla ricerca di quel figlio di una grandissima putt...AHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAA WHA WHA WHAAAAAAAA.\n\n[i][b]Se questa recensione ti \u00e8 piaciuta clicca \"Segui\" sulla [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/retrogamingcafe/curation]pagina del Curatore[/url] del mio gruppo: sarai sempre aggiornato con i miei personali consigli e le recensioni dei migliori titoli indie/retro/roguelite in circolazione![/b][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1494373994, "timestamp_updated": 1498653262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.712944", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31632351": {"recommendationid": "31632351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286913734", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520066039}, "language": "polish", "review": "Super gra! 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1494270711, "timestamp_updated": 1494270780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31620458": {"recommendationid": "31620458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075208214", "num_games_owned": 1662, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493704603}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game, great visuals, interesting story, and great soundtrack.

Completing objectives, from gambling, returning a drunk husband to his wife to transporting buffalo and every western style thing in between nets you clues about your families murder. From the color of his belt buckle to whether he was thin or fat, you piece together bits about what he looks like so you can confront him. Or kill every single person if you want until you stumble upon him!\n\nThe graphics are very old school, taking the style of late 80s early 90s dos games. It reminds me a lot of the animation and graphical style of Delphine Software games like Out of This World. The animation in particular is wonderful. Areas are alive with motion, particularly from animals like birds that take flight as you wander the wild west.\n\nSoundtrack is also great, from saloon pianos to wonderfully atmospheric music as you trek the deserts and forrests.\n\nOne thing though is that the game is not particularly long. My first playthrough took around three and a half hours to avenge the death of mah family. The good news? Game is incredibly replayable. Your family's killer is randomized and there are multiple endings based on your behavior through the game. There are also multiple factions that give you freedom in how you deal with them. For example, the army and indians are in conflict.

Also to use your gun you need to unholster it, cock the hammer, and pull the trigger, this takes three different button pressess which sounds weird on paper but is really satisfying. \n\nThe game world is a bit small compared to other games but offers replayability. You are free to explore as wish and can pull out your gun and shoot anybody at any time. But this is the old west and your choices have consequences so there are plenty of folk who will take out their guns and see fit to fire back. Moreover charecters that are intergral to quests can die and cause you to fail that quest. \n\nThe main goal is to find the man that burned your ranch and murdered your family. The reaseons for why he did it change every game and offer storyline replayability. There are other playable charecters you can unlock with differing gameplay.

The map feels relatively large given the length of a single playthrough(I took about 4 hours). There are a ton of different areas and more quests than you're likely to complete in a single play through. There's a fairly large section of the map I didn't visit at all. Story elements sometimes appear unexpectedly, but I've only played through once so I don't know if they repeat each time or if they're random. \n\nGameplay is diverse. There are poker games you can join in the towns. Riding sections and gun fights on and off horseback. Characters are interesting and involved in complex shenanigans with each other. Quests all feel like little slices of life. \n\nThere aren't any roleplaying elements per se but you can earn money, and reputation.

It's completely optional to take every card player in the saloons to the cleaners by being a poker badass.\n\nYou don't even *have to* buy a gun; you can just use your starting revolver for the whole game, rush through some of the key questline to get a vague idea of who you're going after, and go around accusing people of murder until you trigger the end boss event.\n\nHowever, unless it's for a *specific achievement*, if you play games like this then you're missing the point, and living a bleak, joyless shell of an existence.\n\nShoot some bandits, find some loot, buy a sweet pair of shooting irons, kill some more bad guys, win a few hands of poker and sleep with the sheriff's wife dammit!\n\nAnd when you're done, replay it from the point of view of another character you've unlocked by being an old west badass!", "timestamp_created": 1492627543, "timestamp_updated": 1492627625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31242051": {"recommendationid": "31242051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263268344", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492699781}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d \u0432 \u043f\u0438\u043a\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0445", "timestamp_created": 1492625021, "timestamp_updated": 1492625021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31241587": {"recommendationid": "31241587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057575160", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492584854}, "language": "english", "review": "borning", "timestamp_created": 1492623496, "timestamp_updated": 1492623496, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.304179", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31239423": {"recommendationid": "31239423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314966311", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493048634}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u6211\u662f\u51b2\u7740\u8fd9\u50cf\u7d20\u98ce\u53bb\u7684\uff0c\u770b\u7740\u8fd9\u79cd\u50cf\u7d20\u98ce\u6d51\u8eab\u8212\u7545\n\u7136\u540e\u6211\u6253\u5f00\u73a9\u4e86\u4e00\u4e0b...\n\u6211\u53bb\n\u8fd9\u9b54\u6027\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd9\u9b54\u6027\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\uff0c\u8fd9\u9b54\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u6bd4\u9b54\u6027\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\n\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5143\u7d20\u6df7\u5408\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\u6210\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u72c2\u91ce\u7684\u6e38\u620f\n\u771f\u7684\u5389\u5bb3", "timestamp_created": 1492616288, "timestamp_updated": 1492616288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31239254": {"recommendationid": "31239254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213231587", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492694245}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, nice graphics, I really like pixel games, and nice story.

You play as a gunslinger who is hunting down his family's killer. You gather clues about your culprit's identity through a bunch of different (side-)quests.

You can pull your gun on anyone, including important NPCs, and this sometimes leads to unique dialogue. Everyone can die, too.\n\nThe combat-system is surprisingly intuitive, if a bit simple. You can carry up to three hats. These hats protect you from gunshots. If you get hit, you lose one. If you get hit when your hat-stash is depleted, it's game over, and you'll have to restart from the last checkpoint.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game.

The devs did marvelously with what they had. The amount of content in this game is well worth the price tag. If you're familiar with the genre, you'll feel right at home, despite the 8 bit graphic and the humble length. I got this game after 1 year of release so I had the priviledge of playing the game in such a pristine condition. \n\nEVERY DECISION COUNTS! You'll see every fruit of our actions. If you like gun blazing with bandits, your infamous reputation will make them scare sh**less of you the next time they see you. And beware! ALL NPCS are KILLABLE! So you'd only have to blame yourself if you managed to blow up rancher Richard's head without hearing his proposal first. If you had a twitchy fingers, you might never know what you'd missed.\n\nCOOL MINIGAMES! Whether you want to deal cards at saloon or raiding caravans on the desert, Westerado has just the thing for you! But for the game this size, you have to balance quantity vs quality. I was left begging for more of the wild west thrill even after my 3rd playthrough. \n\nSIMPLE YET FUN COMBAT MECHANIC. You'll always be rewarded with good health if you're a good shot! Too bad most enemies only take 1 shot to take down. I wish there were more enemies like the final boss when you had to dodge, run and maneuver with your enemy because you couldn't just one shot him.\n\nTHE RIGHT ATMOSPHERE. The story is just a normal vendetta cliche, but the context and the atmosphere built around it is excellent! You can see all the struggles between Indians and the Army, between ranchers and the industrial powerouse, yet the approach is so casual and carefree that it's a welcoming change of pace after all the dark, gritty and mature western games we have out there. \n\nWANT TO SETTLE DOWN, BUY A RANCH AND PLAY SIM?......... Almost! You could get our own house though. And a trophy wife lol.\n\nI understand this is a small scale indie game and it has offered me well enough for its price, but I cannot help but notice the potential of this game!

The graphics are extremely primitive and blocky, and the game itself is extremely simple.\n\nAnd yet, when you play it, you realize that some real love went into making it. Unfortunately, while this game has some real charm in its Western theming, and it certainly is clever in some ways, by the end of it I was left feeling as if it never really delivered.\n\nBut I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.\n\nWesterado is a pretty simple game \u2013 you move around in a top-down 2D fashion, you can talk to people and interact with (a very small number of objects) with A, you pull out your gun with the right shoulder button, you cock your gun and shoot it with right trigger (and you must cock your gun before firing it), and you reload with the left shoulder button. That\u2019s it.\n\nWhere the game is interesting is that it is a mystery game \u2013 the central driving theme of the game is that your family was murdered and you, the Gunslinger, are going out into the desert to the nearby towns to collect clues. You\u2019re given one random clue by your dying brother at the start of the game, and you must collect additional clues by talking to people \u2013 and, mostly, by completing various tasks on their behalf. The Native Americans want you to drive off the farmers and help them kill the soldiers and take over the nearby town. The Sheriff is depressed and needs to get back in the saddle, and his cowardice leaves you responsible for looking after the local people. The local railroad has had its tracks blocked off by some bandits, who are being paid off by the Banker, who in turn is in debt to the Oil Baron\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s a bunch of pretty standard Western tropes at play here, and the game plays with them, simultaneously poking fun at the tropes while simultaneously mostly playing them straight. For instance, your health is represented by hats, and when you get shot, your hat gets shot off \u2013 at which point you put on another hat. If you are shot when you are hatless, you die. You can buy new hats at the hatteries, which are definitely not at all suggestive of brothels, and you can also get hats by shooting them off the heads of enemies.\n\nAnd yet, the game is often pretty serious \u2013 people can and do die, and you can even kill off main characters (or get them killed off when they follow you around on quests). Moreover, it is a revenge plot, as you try to track down your family\u2019s murderer, and it plays that revenge plot quite straight \u2013 the murderer really is a terrible person, and when you gun them down at the end, your own homicidal tendencies are put under close examination.\n\nThe game has a lot of quests, and these quests, though short, are how you get most of your clues. Helping out various people with various deeds \u2013 some moral, some evil, some gray \u2013 helps you accumulate clues, and completing entire questlines with people will often reshape the world in some way.\n\nThe intent of the game\u2019s multiple endings is to make these plots matter \u2013 if you follow a plot through to the end, the ending of the game will reveal that your family\u2019s murder is related in some way to what you did during the game.\n\nIt also makes the game replayable \u2013 if you only complete enough quests to get enough clues to find the (randomized in appearance) murderer, who poses as one of the townsfolk in the towns, you can then play the game through again, do a different questline, and then track down the murderer again and get a different ending.\n\nHowever, you can do a great deal of the content in a single playthrough, and this at times makes the game exhibit some odd bugs, such as the oil baron getting to take over a lot of land despite the fact that I never helped him, or a character making reference to some event they couldn\u2019t have seen because they weren\u2019t around at that location to observe it. This was kind of disappointing, and drew me out of the world in my first playthrough.\n\nMy other problem with this game is that, in the end, while the game\u2019s simplicity is a virtue, it also didn\u2019t really give the game much in the way of variety \u2013 ultimately, you just use your gun to shoot bad guys, and talk to people. The bad guys are all pretty samey in the end, with limited variety, and you have seen all that the game has to offer within the first hour or so of gameplay. And while the game itself is pretty short \u2013 and indeed, there\u2019s an achievement for beating it within an hour, something which is eminently doable \u2013 after I beat it for the first time I wasn\u2019t left feeling like I really needed or wanted to do so again.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a terrible game, but it isn\u2019t a very meaty one. If you appreciate very short games, and are willing to go after the murderer fairly swiftly, I suspect this may be okay for you; if you try to play this like a RPG where you try and complete all the sidequests before beating the final boss, I suspect you\u2019re going to feel a bit disappointed. \n", "timestamp_created": 1487912807, "timestamp_updated": 1487912807, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30041046": {"recommendationid": "30041046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163906380", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 939, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507033677}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fantastic.

I won't spoil the ending, as you need to play it to fully understand this, but once it's finally over, it's overwhelmingly satisfying.\nThe freeroam aspect of this game is also great - you can kill pretty much whoever you want (with very few exceptions), do whatever you want, help whoever you want, fight whoever you want, and you can even play card games in one of the two saloons.\nThis game is also full of references and easter eggs, as well as another hidden little story about a certain group of bandits that doesn't affect the story, but adds another layer of depth to this game.\nThere are very few problems, but I guess I should mention them. The combat system can be a little annoying to new players, and it can sometimes seem a little unfair. However, once you've mastered the gunfighting system, it's pretty straightforward - draw weapon, cock weapon, shoot weapon, reload - and it does add a little more accuracy to this game (which to be fair isn't very outlandish to begin with).\nDo I recommend this game?

The game can be short, My first play through lasted 6 hours as I wanted to do everything but the game offers replayability, unlocking new characters and different play styles.\n\nI stumbled along some bugs while doing missons but they weren't major. \n\nMy rating for the game - \n\n8/10\n\nBuy it if you ever get the chance.\n\n\nALSO the soundtrack is very good, here's my favourite track from it - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Txvads1Q0Y", "timestamp_created": 1485547985, "timestamp_updated": 1486575612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29512758": {"recommendationid": "29512758", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989236581", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485471703}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my biggest gripes with the open world genre as of recent is how the main quest always seems to conflict with the idea of \"do whatever you want, go wherever you want\" that these games intend to transmit. \"The world is under threat by an evil force and I am the only one who has the mcguffin to stop it, but im going to help this man find his goat first\"\nThere always seems to exist a clash between the optional content and the main quest of these games, where the urgency of  the main storyline is brought to a hault so the player can do some side missions that in no way influence the outcome of the plot. This is not the always the case, but I do see some struggle in making a worthwhile and compelling story intertwined with sidequests, and even big games like Witcher 3 suffer from it, having a Hero's Journey narrative as the main quest when the optional content is so much more entertaining and interesting, and so removed from what you expect of the main storyline.\nThis isnt an easy thing to do, I can think of Morrowind and New Vegas as games that manage those aspects very well.\n\nWell, I can now add Westerado to those games that balance the main quest with the optional ones.\nIn Westerado, your family is killed by a criminal, and your objetive is to find out who this guys is so you can kill him. Thats it. Simplistic I know, but it works wonders for how the game's quests revolve around that main goal.\nYou see, everytime you do a favor for someone in this world, they will give you a clue about how the bad guy looks, narrowing it down a-la Guess Who? boardgame.\nThis criminal is of course randomized, so the nature of the game is about replaying it so you can see the different outcomes of every storyline, because you essencially create it using the template the game provides you as a canvas.\nIts such a simple thing, but it makes every single quest mean something to the main plot and giving you the choice of how you want to build that main plot since every quest can factor to the end goal.\nQuests even intertwine with others, creating some surprising domino effects that increase the game's replayabilty. \n\nThe game also has an hilarious mechanic where you can pull out your revolver mid conversation with NPCs and just shoot them if you are sick of hearing them. You can literally kill everyone and still reach the ending and in fact, the game lets you accuse anyone you find on the street from the get-go and you could actually find the criminal just by mere coincidence doing that. \nThese simple yet inventive design choices for the game provide some quite hilarious and movie inspired scenes where you are pulling your gun at everyone, making false accusations and creating a quick bloodbath.\n\nNow, im aware that this alone isnt gonna get Westerado all the awards for best storytelling or whatever, but I wish other games would be this creative about how they implement their narratives on games and I think this game is a great source of inspiration for it.\nI really appreciate when games manage to merge gameplay and story in a meaningful way to the point you cant distinguish them, and I think you wont waste your time on this underappreciated gem.\n\nAs for the rest, you can already see it has very charming pixel art and cool Western aestethic, and the game doesnt shy away from showing from what movies it takes inspiration from.

Everything about the murderer is random; from his look, to his allegiances, hell, he can even be your pops. Now that's freaky.\n\nThe game world isn't too big, but it's fun to explore and filled with personality. However, the game can be incredibly short, especially when one character gives you a metric fuck ton of clues in one go. This is one game I wouldn't mind having some padding, frankly. Hell, each time I've played the game I've killed the murderer before I even bought a second revolver! Shame.\n\nSince I wrote this review, I've unlocked the other two characters. Hero is totally standard. He starts off with 3 hats and a revolver, and can take 4 hits before death with full hats. Brother is different; he starts with a revolver AND dual revolvers (which I didn't even realize until I tried to buy the dual revolvers from the general store, that was embarassing) and he can't wear hats. He's basically the \"What you thought this game was going to be when you bought it\" character. Sister and Indian are basically different looking Hero-s with different weapons (Sister has a shotgun and revolver, Indian has like a tomahawk or something).\n\nThe combat is...unusual. You and enemies can only fire horizontally; no diagonals or verticals here. I can understand why they wouldn't let you shoot diagonally, but I feel like if they let you shoot vertically it could make the combat even better; then again, the final boss basically hinges on the fact that you can only shoot horizontally, so...yeah. The AI is decent enough, but it's really easy to trick them by camping near a transition...zone...thing...and killing them all there. I used this tactic a lot against groups simply because I found it amusing how they couldn't follow me out of their area. But if you actually fight in the zone the combat is much more tense and entertaining.\n\nAlso, if you kill enough bandits, those that are still alive will become absolutely terrified of you and won't shoot unless you do.

It captures the feel of a good ol\u2019 fashioned Wild West revenge flick while having a good, and sometimes really weird, sense of humor.\n\nThe fact that you can pull out your gun on anyone during any point in a conversation should tell you quite a bit about the tone of the game. The metaphor for physical intimacy also deserves a nod. You\u2019ll run into weirdos, bandits, hat makers, bandits, people that can use your help, and more bandits. On your quest for revenge you can change the fate of some characters if you follow through on their questlines or just murder them in cold blood. \n\nAll of the above means that there are different outcomes and methods to solving the same quest. For example, there\u2019s a group of bandits blocking the railway with their shenanigans. You could murder them all, turn them into the sheriff\u2019s deputies through a series of complicated steps, or even scare them away with a certain NPC. If you\u2019re looking for an uncomplicated experience, murder tends to be a viable method of solving things, but know that it doesn\u2019t have to be the only way. Making good dialogue choices might also accomplish the same task. Let\u2019s not forget, you\u2019re actively collecting clues to have a more complete picture of who the murderer is and the identity changes with every new game. Completing quests for NPCs rewards you with a single clue. You can also find the murderer by accident which I was able to do once. Let\u2019s just say I forgot how to holster my pistol correctly.\n\nDiscovery is a big part of the game and the multiple endings add to that feeling. The kind of person you are is reflected in the ending and can be affected by siding yourself with important quest givers. If you\u2019re achievement hunter, Westerado might have an even greater appeal to you since they generally have you going after different outcomes or scenarios that you might not have thought were possible. You can also have fun just by finishing the game a couple of times.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, responsive, and satisfying. You can shoot left or right and can move up or down. You have to pull back the hammer before you can fire and each round must be manually reloaded. This leads to some tense moments as you have to balance when to reload versus shooting back. Revolvers aren\u2019t the only weapons, but they\u2019re what I prefer. You can buy a shotgun, a rifle, or another revolver for some dual-wielding action.\n\nAnother great thing about the combat for Westerado is that enemies can harm each other. Maybe you don\u2019t have a great window for reloading and there are enemies on both sides. Some nimble footwork can have enemies shooting at each other while you dance around. Most of the time, it happens accidentally, but doing it deliberately is also fun. Keep in mind that friendlies can unintentionally do the same thing to you and vice versa. Your lives are represented by the number of hats you have. You can have up to three hats to absorb shots; a man with no hat has a very short life expectancy. \n\nThere are only a couple negative criticisms I can make. Sometimes alternate solutions to quests are just really complicated, even if you bust out a guide. If you mess up, you\u2019ll need to start a new game. The fact that playthroughs can become very short once your familiarity with the game increases does soften the blow. The other aspect of the game I didn\u2019t like were the really blocky characters. The environments looked fairly okay with the pixel art, but the people were just giant pixels to me. A few more details wouldn\u2019t have hurt.\n\nOther than those two things, I think Westerado is worth your time, especially if you\u2019re a fan of the wild west setting. The fun gameplay, the silly things you can do, and the varied outcomes make this game pretty fun.

From the outset you can explore the open world as you wish, talking to anyone, killing anyone (if that's the way you like your Westerns), taking names and taking hats. The protagonist's accent is captured surprisingly well for text-based dialogue, and it adds that little extra charm to the game. \n\nThere are warring factions in the West: the army, the Indians, the townsfolk, the oil tycoon. You can side with anyone and reap the consequences, or remain a lone gunman on his quest for vengeance. \n\nThe music provides a huge part of the Western feel too, though it does eventually get a bit repetitive. \n\nThere's also a good number of easter eggs and pop culture references, and the writing is just all-around light-humoured and entertaining to read.\n\nA typical game from start to finish can last anywhere from 30 minutes to 10 hours or so depending on how thorough you are.

Every negative review harps on about how the gunplay is bad or that the game only lasts 2-3 hours, the gunplay is really a matter of opinion (I personally like it, and that seems to be the popular opinion) but the playtime argument isn't really valid. replayability is very high, you can fail almost every quest, and you'll have to figure out a new way to get hints as to who the murderer is. Playing one questline will often make another group/faction's questline inaccessible. So you can't play through all of the content in one playthrough, no matter what. What that means is, the playtime may be 2-3 hours, but that's only for your first playthrough. after that you'll be able to explore all the questlines you didn't get to play, and on the way to those you'll probably find an entirely new storyline you had never even seen. The game is jam packed with content, most of which requires exploring to find. \n\nYou can beat the game only exploring around 25% of the map. Or in some cases, even finding the murderer by chance alone. The murderer is always walking around, so shooting random people is a legitimate strategy. You'll also unlock new characters to play as, allowing for challenge runs. The game also has a local co-op mode, though I never personally played it. The game is actually funny but doesn't go overboard on jokes, as to make it solely reliant on humor. You don't have to play through the same questlines over and over again for different playthroughs, the entire world is open from the start. So when you want to go back and find what other stuff you missed, you'll just be able to run to that location/look around for secrets.\n\nThe only complaint i can really issue is little, but towards the end game, so hover over if you don't mind spoiling some of the end game. [spoiler] The game has the same ending sequence each time you play, so every time you go to chase after the murderer, he will always get away and run to the end area.

Fine. So I go to the train station and get that, bring it back to him, he give's me a miner helmet, then I die while going through the mine, losing the helmet so I have to wing it in darkness. When I finally get the guy, some jerks start shooting at me, and while I'm shooting back at them, the guy I'm trying to guide out of the mine for my quest runs like a chicken with his head cut off, right into the line of my gunfire, getting himself killed, which basically means I wasted about 25 minutes of my time on a quest that failed in one instant of the AI suiciding\n\n- Pop culture jokes: I used to love this stuff, but I don't need to see Game of Thrones jokes (yes, I saw one in this game) in my western game I'm trying to get into\n\n- Non-human enemies such as wolves can be a pain to kill, simply because lining up shots the way this game's combat works is pretty challenging. I shot three guys' hats off in a row, getting an achievement for that, but could not manage to shoot a wolf despite emptying my gun on it at different angles, trying to score a hit\n\n- 8-bit graphics are old hat by now, and this game's combat system suffers for it. Blaster Master has more angles you can shoot at, and that came out in 1988. They could do so much better without having to go too much higher on a technical level.\n\n- Lack of a main quest/motivation: Sure, the game gives you an end goal, but the game is sort of like \"Hey, just do everything, and you'll get clues about who the killer is whom you're trying to find.\" In other words, you're encouraged to do every quest, without being told which quest(s) are necessary to complete the game. You will be running around just doing crap hoping it gets you closer to the end of the game, without really knowing if it does or not. This isn't particularly compelling or exciting.\n\n-----Conclusion-----\n\nAlthough there are some nice positives to this game, the negatives outweighed it for me, with the weird gunplay/combat mechanics that predate games from the late 80s, and the heap of quests the game throws on you without any indication of what's important and what's just busywork for suckers. A few decent features unfortunately do not make the overall experience of this game an enjoyable one for me, so I cannot recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1479101384, "timestamp_updated": 1479101610, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459652", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26569856": {"recommendationid": "26569856", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985280211", "num_games_owned": 535, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478993529}, "language": "english", "review": "Short Wild West themed game you can probably finish in one sitting.

It was a Flash-based game then but it was well made. As far as I understand, this is just an expanded version of that, so assuming it\u2019s still available, you can go and enjoy it for a while before making a purchase.\n\nI got [i]Westerado: Double Barreled[/i] from [i]Humble GEMS Bundle[/i], aptly named because it is exactly that \u2015 a sweet little gem. It\u2019s by no means huge, don\u2019t take the talk about its open world to mean that this is one of those games where you can spend a hundred hours just wandering around and still not discover everything. Its size is instead rather fitting the 8-bit esthetics it carries. But still, there is plenty to discover, beautiful pixel graphics to enjoy, secrets and easter eggs to find \u2015 and the game is partly randomized and possesses different paths you can take so that it really is a somewhat different experience every time. Overall, it took me 5 and \u00bd hours, according to the in-game timer, to complete it for the first time, discovering all of the map in the process (though not finishing all the quests). But you can also complete it in less than 30 minutes if you try to speedrun it.\n\nI think that the relative, and apparent, simplicity of [i]Westerado[/i] is one of its greatest pluses. You know how sometimes video games draw you in with promises of an epic adventure or a deep story, and then it turns out that this gets completely compromised by the \u201cgamey\u201d mechanics? All of the big concepts get squished into the narrow constraints of a typical video game: a compass marker tells you where to go to complete your task, a named character means a quest giver, you\u2019re presented with a \u201cgood\u201d and an \u201cevil\u201d response during a conversation\u2026\n\nWell, what [i]Westerado[/i] does is kind of the opposite. You come in expecting a simple game where you shoot bad guys and collect bags marked \u201c$$$\u201d. You have hats which are tongue-in-cheek stand-ins for lives. You can also buy better weapons in the shop but don\u2019t have to worry about ammunition, it\u2019s infinite. Everything about the game, up to and including its graphics, tells you that it\u2019s an arcade title, one that tests your dexterity for a while and then maybe assigns you a points score.\n\nOnly that it isn\u2019t. What you will discover is a world full of characters whose fates you can indirectly decide. There\u2019s never an obvious indication of the magnitude of your actions, you just do whatever feels right, and the consequences arise later. Don\u2019t take me wrong, this game isn\u2019t very serious and there aren\u2019t huge moral quandaries. But what impressed me is complexity that arises organically from simplicity, rather than being forced from above and ultimately constrained. There is a kind of honesty that [i]Westerado[/i] has in comparison to most RPGs and the like.\n\nThere are, of course, bad sides to this game. The music is not terrible at all but there\u2019s not a lot of it either \u2015 I think only one track per area \u2015 so you\u2019re going to be listening to the same tune on repeat most of the time. Also, combat can be frustrating sometimes, weapons are not very well balanced, and there will be a new bug every couple of minutes. But overall, it\u2019s hard not to recommend this delightful title, especially if you find it on a sale or something.", "timestamp_created": 1478980833, "timestamp_updated": 1478980833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551282", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26555524": {"recommendationid": "26555524", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992776583", "num_games_owned": 971, "num_reviews": 289, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478951055}, "language": "english", "review": "Health system inspired by Team Fortress 2's obsession of hats.", "timestamp_created": 1478948032, "timestamp_updated": 1478948032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26552015": {"recommendationid": "26552015", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977941855", "num_games_owned": 526, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478928835}, "language": "english", "review": "Nails a western perfectly.\nBeautiful pixel art. \nCo-op is a lot of fun. \nTotally worth the humble bundle price of $4.", "timestamp_created": 1478932126, "timestamp_updated": 1478932126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26551455": {"recommendationid": "26551455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085093968", "num_games_owned": 337, "num_reviews": 163, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477151065}, "language": "english", "review": "What just happened.", "timestamp_created": 1478928935, "timestamp_updated": 1478928935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26539386": {"recommendationid": "26539386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045739246", "num_games_owned": 2872, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479450507}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u897f\u90e88bit\u98a8\u683c RPG  \u96d6\u8aaa\u662f\u7368\u7acb\u88fd\u4f5c\n\u4f46\u662f\u505a\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u5b8c\u5584 \u5730\u5716\u5927 \u53ef\u4ee5\u8ddf\u6bcf\u500b\u8def\u4eba\u8aaa\u8a71 \u90fd\u6709\u7368\u7279\u8a71\u8a9e\n\u53ef\u4ee5\u96a8\u610f\u6bba\u4eba(\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5361\u95dc)\n\u975e\u5e38\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u904a\u6232\n\u5287\u60c5\u5c31\u662f\u7c21\u55ae\u7684 \u627e\u51fa\u6bba\u5bb3\u5bb6\u4eba\u7684\u5147\u624b\n\u4f46\u662f\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u5c0d\u65b9\u9577\u600e\u6a23\n\u900f\u904e\u89e3\u4efb\u52d9\u5b8c\u6210 NPC\u6703\u6162\u6162\u544a\u8a34\u4f60\u7dda\u7d22 \u62fc\u6e4a\u51fa\u5147\u624b\u7684\u7279\u5fb5\n\n\u904a\u6232\u7cbe\u5de7\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u9084\u6709  \u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u8def\u7dda\u7684\u7d50\u5c40 \u53ef\u4ee5\u9078\u64c7\u7ad9\u5728\u7f8e\u570b\u4eba/\u5370\u5730\u5b89\u4eba \u6216\u662f \u77f3\u6cb9\u4e3b/\u8fb2\u5834\u4e3b \n\u5404\u7a2e\u7acb\u5834\u90fd\u6703\u9020\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u7d50\u679c\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\u4e5f\u5f88\u8010\u73a9\n\n8/10\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1478881129, "timestamp_updated": 1478881129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531542", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26529015": {"recommendationid": "26529015", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065216961", "num_games_owned": 716, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480545324}, "language": "english", "review": "First game in quite a while that had me on the floor laughing.

It has some problems stemming from basic design issues, but they're not impossible to look past. The idea is you're hunting down a criminal, but you don't know what he looks like and have to get hints from people to narrow down who it could be so you can confront and accuse them. This in practice boils down to doing sidequests and piecing together a picture of your culprit. Combat can be a little frustrating at first; you have to line up your shot, pull out your gun (without your gun you can only walk, not run), cock it, and shoot, each of which is a different button on your controller. In practice, combat boils down to getting right in your opponents line of fire and shooting them faster than they can shoot you. Shooting can only happen in two directions, so there's a lot of running around from all parties when a gunfight breaks out, and it feels like The Magnificent Seven (the new one, I haven't seen the old one), when all the cowboys are running and ducking about for cover before actually firing back.\nA few of the quests are a little bit frustratingly ambiguous, but the world is small enough and your map is serviceable enough to help you find what you need to even when you're not given some sort of quest marker. \nMy biggest gripe with the game has to be how much things break down a little when you've gained a reputation. After killing only a couple of bands of outlaws (or maybe it was specific outlaws, who knows) every random encounter I came across saw my enemies too scared to start a fight with me. That's a really cool feature, but made the last half of my game pretty uneventful altogether. That, and sometimes you can accidently aggro a faction and then encounter them later on in a place where being their enemies automatically fails a quest for you, without being able to undo that (this happened for me when I told the bullheads to work for a caravan company, and then before they left shot them all. I later encountered them at the caravan company, somehow still alive, but mad that I'd shot them all).

Recommend purchase during sale/discount.\n \n\nReceived the game via Humble Bundle purchase. Heard about the game and how it's a one-time playthrough kind of game. \n\nStarting the game, the visuals of the game are pixellated but with coloring to give you the sense of a western, desert environment. The music immerses you in an environment with various scenery and music to give a sense of cowboys and indians, ragtime in a saloon, and exploring mines. It very much feels as if you're involved in a time of the Old Wild West. \n\nWith immersion aside, the gameplay mechanics did feel clunky and frustrating. Navigating the map was often as simple as following the notches on the edge of the squares on your map to new areas. Combat involved lining your character along a plane so that your weapon fires at the enemy. This plane of firing is only horizontal, meaning it's more beneficial to wait for your enemy to walk into your plane versus walking into your enemy's. Quest mechanics felt very frustrating as your \"objective\" in your quest log wasn't always specific and left you talking to vairous NPCs/roaming the map looking for a distinguished character that may have some new information. \n\nBoth positive and negative considered, the game is defintely worth a pickup lasting 1-3 hours minimum for an initial playthrough, with further hours added for replayability in alternate endings, achievements, and easter eggs. I do not believe it is worth the current pricing of $14.99, but there are levels of polish with the music/visuals/side-quests that definitely make it worth the pick-up on a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1478090906, "timestamp_updated": 1478090906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26366419": {"recommendationid": "26366419", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978761138", "num_games_owned": 449, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477716440}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a flash game on steroids.", "timestamp_created": 1478054138, "timestamp_updated": 1478054138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26364356": {"recommendationid": "26364356", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993419968", "num_games_owned": 935, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478039349}, "language": "english", "review": "Didn't expect to enjoy this anywhere near as much as I did.", "timestamp_created": 1478043392, "timestamp_updated": 1478043392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501247", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26363249": {"recommendationid": "26363249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001614017", "num_games_owned": 782, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478037783}, "language": "english", "review": "The concept wasn't too bad, but the combat sequences were more annoying than fun, and the game itself is really rather short.

With all my love to pixel-art graphics at first I was a little bit sceptical while playing Westerado since the retro fascination was brought to a really high level here, but I eventually got used to this style. What's more, in the end i explored the whole map just to enjoy all music themes and graphical concepts.\n\nI wouldn't say that Westerado could be a PC's Red Dead Redemption substitute for obvious reasons such as graphics or relatively simple plot. The main difference however is the fact that Westerado is far less complex and, at least for me, more relaxing than Rockstar's game. \n\nIt is really brilliant how delevoper managed to combine the simplicity of a tiny indie game with the wide range of activities, locations and dialogues. What's more, your choices made during the whole game have their consequences in future and it is up to you how you will get to the final scene.

In fact, the game does a lot of things right. It has a great art style, a bold and fitting soundtrack and what I liked most is it gives you a lot of freedom. Every character in the game as far as I can tell can be killed, which changes the game.\n\nHowever, the most glaring issue is the combat. I'm not really sure why people are praising the gunplay in this game. It is simple but not in a good way. Overly simple to the point where aiming is just a chore. To fire your gun, you press J to unholster it, K to cock it and K again to fire. This is fine, but when you are given basically no idicator or reticle to where your shot will land it just ends up frustrating when you are certain you will hit someone and it misses. This could easily be fixed by simply adding a reticle to where your shot will land.\n\nOmitting such an indicator isn't good design. It doesn't make the game harder in a way that is challenging yet fair. It's just annoying.\n\nThat said, if you can get past this, I would look at checking this game out for the aspects and mechanics it gets right. As I said, visually and audibly the game is fantasic. Both contribute to creating a world truly reminiscent of the wild west and to do so within the confines of a retro style is very impressive.\n\nCharacter dialogue is also natural and written to match the theme well. No voice acting is present in the game, yet the dialect the characters speak in aid the western feel the game goes for, even if the \"ah\" in replacement for \"I\" can get tedious after a while.\n\nI have only played under an hour, but I can only assume the hint system is in fact a system created to enchance the uniqueness of the game instead of just a way to advance the story. Furthermore the story is solid, albiet not wholly original. You play as a gunslinging rancher whos family are killed by bandit(s?) and you are set on your path of redemption.\n\nOverall, this game just solidifies why the Steam thumbs up and down system isn't suitable. I'm in the middle. If you find the game on sale, try it, if not just to experience the world the game establishes.

The missions were a lot of fun to complete at your own pace while working toward the overarching story. This game would have been perfect except for two issues that really bothered me: 1) you can't redo failed quests, and the worst being 2) combat is generally kinda wonky. \n\nThe combat really frustrated me because it was terrible compared to the rest of the game. Movement in general is kind of weird since it feels like you're a rook on a chess board. And then to add to the awkwardness of combat, you can only point your gun left or right while facing either direction. If someone is above you, you need to run upward and get him to your left or right side lined up since you can only shoot against that axis. You also can't run and shoot at the same time, needing to redrawn your gun. I died a bunch of times because of how awkward the controls feel - and dying isn't cheap since I kept getting robbed while unconscious. \n\nI'm upset they made such a great western game but couldn't figure out how to implement simple shooting mechanics.", "timestamp_created": 1477195947, "timestamp_updated": 1483812561, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535913", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26175491": {"recommendationid": "26175491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042106737", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482651323}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "Um dos cl\u00e1ssicos do John Ford por descobrir.", "timestamp_created": 1477195265, "timestamp_updated": 1477195265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26167666": {"recommendationid": "26167666", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992091513", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477158216}, "language": "english", "review": "4/5", "timestamp_created": 1477158343, "timestamp_updated": 1477158343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496331", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26165618": {"recommendationid": "26165618", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162745160", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482401499}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has no ''load game'' option so if you screw up a quest you can't play that quest again. i have to make a new game over and over again !", "timestamp_created": 1477151263, "timestamp_updated": 1477151263, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.411471", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26151675": {"recommendationid": "26151675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256090454", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510967949}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a worth the $6 sale...", "timestamp_created": 1477081724, "timestamp_updated": 1477081724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.404527", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26147622": {"recommendationid": "26147622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041743657", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477065880}, "language": "english", "review": "I wouldn't say it's worth 15 because it's a two hour long game, but it's worth 5, and that's what I got it for. :^)", "timestamp_created": 1477066122, "timestamp_updated": 1477066122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26146533": {"recommendationid": "26146533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036649778", "num_games_owned": 484, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477080725}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm in the very beginning and I'm already hooked.

There are lots of side quests to find and complete all of which have interesting stories to uncover and it captures the feel of the Wild West excellently\n\nThe writing is done phonetically for a Southern drawl which helps make it feel more real and the writing itself is fantastic and has simple, fun and often intense gunplay. A few different weapons to play around with: Revolver, Rifle, Shotgun, Dual Revolvers and Bolas\n\nThe game offers multiple endings and a few characters which can be unlocked. The game offers an excellent soundtrack and great sound effects. There are several factions/gangs within the game with poker mini-games and bounties which can be completed for money, however, the main quests can be completed very quickly though as mentioned there are plenty of side quests to do\n\nSadly, the game world is the same every time you play and areas aren't repopulated after everyone in said area is killed so there's no reason to revisit areas you've already passed through and the amount of money you lose when you die is too high in my opinion\n\nHowever, an excellent open world Western shooter with gorgeous pixel graphics, a big open world, fantastic writing and intense gunplay. If you're a fan of Westerns then you definitely need to pick this game up!\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1476048375, "timestamp_updated": 1476048375, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450088", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25849192": {"recommendationid": "25849192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084741033", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474019273}, "language": "english", "review": "always wear protection (hats)", "timestamp_created": 1475555582, "timestamp_updated": 1475555582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.383130", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25609125": {"recommendationid": "25609125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078809866", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502401704}, "language": "english", "review": "Cowboy Simulator 2016", "timestamp_created": 1474403286, "timestamp_updated": 1474403286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.400010", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25435030": {"recommendationid": "25435030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024482181", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473468690}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 amazing non-linear gameplay experience.", "timestamp_created": 1473469152, "timestamp_updated": 1473469152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473883", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25393157": {"recommendationid": "25393157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090815288", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451934893}, "language": "english", "review": "Wanted to rob the bank.

First of all, it's probably one of the few pixel indies I've played that could actually be called \"open world.\" Secondly, it's not open world in the Ubisoft sense where you run around collecting junk to check off markers on a map - it's actually got divergent paths that can make playthroughs radically different. \n\nFor example, on my first playthrough:\n* I didn't really know what I was doing and accidentally shot the gun store owner.\n* Since I was now barred from buying new weapons, all the bandits in the desert kicked my ass and kept me from exploring more than 50% of the map.\n* I totally botched a raid on the oil tycoon's house because my firepower wasn't good enough.\n* I tried to get with this lady in a red dress who seemed interested in me, but because I had shot a bunch of guys at the oil tycoon's crib, they kept coming at me for revenge when I neared the premises. Thus, I wasn't able to talk to the red lady in that particular location and complete the quest line.\n* Despite all this, I still managed to beat the game thanks to the train conductor, who gave me info on the guy who burned down my ranch after I bribed the thugs who had set up shop on the rail tracks. \n\nOn my second playthrough:\n* Instead of shooting the gun store owner, I carefully purchased a fine pair of dual wielding pistols.\n* Blessed with double the gunpowder, I mowed down all those bandits preventing me from exploring the mines.\n* I successfully brokered peace between the Native Americans and the white folks, thanks to the fact that I could now make it through the mines to explore the forest on the other side of the map.\n* I cleared the train tracks again and reunited with my sister, who came to visit me from the big city! Together we helped fix a town's water supply. \n* I was able to complete the quest line with the lady in the red dress, but because I had killed so many dudes in the desert with my two pistols, she said I was too violent and she had really just been using me for sex. I got mad and shot her. \n* I still botched the raid on the oil tycoon's house, and he ended up killing all of my fellow rancher friends, but I got revenge this time and blasted him away in his office once I'd dispatched the goons at the front door.\n* Finally, when I reached the end boss, he revealed that the aforementioned fellow ranchers had *gasp* actually been setting me up the whole time, and had hired him to burn down my family's ranch to lessen the competition!  \n\nThere's still enough stuff left in Westerado to make third and fourth playthroughs worth my while. I've unlocked the ability to play as my sister and brother and I want to try allying WITH the oil tycoon instead of unsuccessfully raiding his house over and over again.

The art is good and the music is fantastic.  The writing is great, with a lot of humour.  Combat is probably the weakest part of the game, and can be a little clunky.  You only shoot left or right so a lot of combat is running up/down, drawing, cocking, and shooting.\n\nBeating the game for the first time takes 1-2 sittings, depending on how much you explore.  The bulk of the gameplay is in replaying to follow different quest lines, take different sides of conflicts, and see things that you missed.\n\nOverall it's a delightful and enjoyable game that will stick around for me as something fun and light to replay for a quick hour.", "timestamp_created": 1467490798, "timestamp_updated": 1467490798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507187", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23848488": {"recommendationid": "23848488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090734185", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508215883}, "language": "english", "review": "A diamond in the rough, discovered this by watching Yogscast Lewis and Sips on a stream and couldn't help but pick it up.

And I must say, it's an enormous amount.\n\nWesterado is an eight-bit RPG set in the Wild West. Or rather, a version of the Wild West built out of the most delightfully hilarious stereotypes and Spaghetti Western tropes imaginable. Make no mistake, this is a world of intensive depth, which will require many hours of exploration to see all of, despite any initial appearances to the contrary. From the scorchingly bright deserts, to the cool and gentle forests and the dingy underground, this world breathes life from every pixel. Long after you believe you've found everything the game has to offer, you'll stumble on some new quest or hidden grotto. It's helped in no small part by an utterly perfect soundtrack, which encapselates every dramtically cliched aspect of the Wild West one could hope for. \n\nThe gameplay is exceptionally original, clever and intuitive. From the use of your favourite hard-wearing hats as a set of lives (Don't get too attached now!) to the simple and brilliantly intuitive gunplay, which will keep you coming back time after time. In the new 'Double Barreled' steam version, there is also a larger plethora of weapons to choose from. The experience is delivered through a main quest, dealing with hunting down the man who killed your family, countless side quests of varying complexity and length, and two world-spanning questlines. (The Army versus the Indians and the Ranchers versus the Oil Tycoon) In addition, there are various rewarding side activities, like bounty-hunting and poker. Red Dead Redemption comes readily to mind, though this is a far more humorous experience. \n\nThe ending is deeply satisfying and well-executed, maintaining the game's balance of humour and surprisingly investing drama. It must be said that it's sole flaw is it's difficulty. While Westerado is intended to be as unforgiving as the old-school titles it imitates, there are times at which it becomes a bit absurd, and simply counter-productive. \n\nMost notably, the game's lack of save feauture means that the player can pour a dozen hours into completing nearly everything, only to accidentally cock one's gun in the wrong place and turn key story-characters permenantly aggressive, thus making it impossible to finish certain quests that time around. It would be rather nice to make the system a little kinder to minor mistakes like this, perhaps with a warning system of some kind when dealing with the most key characters. \n\nIn closing, Westerado is a startlingly deep, witty and timeless experience, which any fan of related genres is likely to find highly rewarding. With the above caveat as a warning, I recommend it highly. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1457659860, "timestamp_updated": 1457659860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543860", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21752463": {"recommendationid": "21752463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031437357", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1008, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462193295}, "language": "german", "review": "Gut.

[b]While [i]Westerado: Double Barreled[/i] has some absolutely beautiful artwork and quite appropriate music and sounds, it suffers from fairly awkward gameplay and being overly simple.[/b] The concept on paper is pretty good - a small western sandbox game with a bite-sized storyline and side quests. The dialogue is pretty meh, and the controls feel awkward (for some reason I cannot quite put my finger on; more on this in the 'Cons' below).\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Beautiful artwork and animations.\n+Music and sounds are appropriate for this genre, albeit fairly generic.\n+Local co-op is a nice touch.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-[b][i]My biggest problem with the awkward controls is the shooting mechanic[/i] - because the camera view is both sort of top-down [i]and[/i] side scrolling. You have to line your gun up with the enemy, and not so much your body, which for some reason throws my brain for a loop with this game. Its weird.[/b]\n-Honestly, this feels like something that would be free on some free flash website (it may have been, in fact). Other than the beautiful artwork, nothing really merits the fairly high price tag. The gameplay is very simplistic, which IMO seems to be the trend with [i]Adult Swim Games[/i] (in fact, I will mostly be avoiding titles from them in the future).\n-This genre is beat. As far as the 'western' genre, this game is as stock as it gets. I'm not saying we need to add zombies or anything, but I need something to give it its own character or personality.\n-Sandbox is very small - I've seen almost 100% of it in about an hour.\n\n[b]In conclusion, its cute and certainly has great artwork - but the core gameplay is too simplistic and has moderately awkward controls due to the side-scrolling/top down conundrum.[/b] I get why some people have love for this, but I also don't see them getting that many hours out of it to merit the price tag (average looks to be about 2.5 hours, and I mean its a fifteen dollar game).

In this case, less is more. The more I put into it, the more I get out of it. If you're like me and like to grind out a map until you discover all of it and then sulk when a quest doesn't drop off because you screwed it up, then Westerado will tickle your fancy. It's plain fun. It has great, funny dialogue. The music is captivating. The plot is classic as are the iconic Western references.

But when it comes to it, you and only you are responsible for whether it'll be an epic adventure or a series of swift tense shootouts.\n\nThe main quest this game gives you every time is to find The Murderer.\nWho is one, where is one, how does one look - it is all decided randomly.\nThe Murderer is always there, and really, nothing stops you from finding The Murderer literally by the course of \"elimination\". Well, nothing except for a really hot pack of lead coming your way.\n\nSo, maybe you'll want to have a one game run like this, and then to concentrate on finding the Murderer with help of NPCs in another, and then start anew with an intention to dig the game world deeper in one direction or the other, because you can hear about some interesting stuff from NPCs. Restoring a railroad line? Involving yourself with Indian tribe affairs? Scrap some buck and buy a house? There is a lot of stuff to do and discover, especially if you're not overusing game's fast-travel system.\n\nBut the pinnacle of this game is gunplay. It's the core mechanic, and developers got it just right.\nWho would have thought that it can feel so right in a top-down action-adventure game?\nUnholstering, cocking your gun, pointing, pulling the trigger - everything feels and sounds so good!\nEven reloading has some soul put into it.

The palette is really colorful, and locations are as diverse as The Old West can allow.\n\nThe music is nice, main theme is catchy and not very annoying, which exactly what it needs to be.\n\nSo, take really high replayability, add cool core mechanic, okay sound and retro visual style and you get  Westerado - a good game with criminally low sales.\n\nP.S.

Westerado slides firmly into the last category.\n\nThe first thing I want to talk about is the atmosphere. This is easily the top reason to buy this game-the world is laid out metroid-vania style, and each screen is lovingly detailed. Locations range from ranches to towns, caves to deserts, abandoned towns to bandit hole-ups. Each of these areas have something do do; generally someone to kill, and sometimes quests or hidden secrets. On top of all this, the music that plays is very fitting, While some of it is more ambiance than music-like the cave theme-most of the overworld music is just a great blend of guitar, banjo, and harmonica, making for great western music.\n\nThe game's premise is that someone has killed your family and you're out for vengeance. The killer is randomly generated, and to find him you must gather clues to his appearance (Guess Who style) by solving problems for the local folks. This makes the game a variable length...some questlines give you a lot of clues, and depending on which quests you complete you can get different endings. This works well enough, and it adds to the replay value just a tad. I'll come back to this.\n\nThe combat in this game is great. There's a variety of weapons available--a Colt revolver from the get-go, and a coachgun, repeating rifle, and a set of dual revolvers available from the shop, and bolas and a tomahawk besides. I've had the time to test all but the tomahawk, and they're all fun to use-the default revolver is probably the best, but everything else works better situationally...the coach and rifle reload slowly, but they can hit in clusters or pierce respectively. The dual revolvers are a lot of fun, and can shoot in both directions at once. The bolas tie up an enemy, making it easier to shoot their hats off. Hats serve as your health-each time you are shot, you lose a hat, and if you are shot without a hat, you die. If you shoot an enemy's hat off, he'll usually run off, and you can take the hat for your own.\n\nAs to replayability, each run on the game is good for an hour or two on average, less if you know what you're doing. While there are several endings, the game gets a bit repetitive after a while.\n\nThis game is absolutely worth five to ten dollars, and is definitely worth your attention. With how much fun I've had in the time I've played, I feel like a sequel would totally be worth it.\n\nOne of the biggest things holding this game back is the randomized killer. Having a randomized killer means that there's a whole bunch of NPCs with zero point, spewing the same lines every time you speak to them. Removing it gives room for more quests, more fun, and more fleshed out characters to populate Clintville.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game when it's on sale, and a tentative recommendation when it's not. Fifteen dollars might be a bit much for this, unfortunately.

My mandatory obscure indie game my best of 2015, and it's a good pick. Created by Ostrich Banditos and published by Adult Swim Games, this game is the closest thing I've played to Red Dead Redemption since I played Red Dead Redemption. It's the closest thing on PC to it, and that's pretty cool. So should you pick it up? Well, let's take a look at it to find out.\n\nSTORY: You are... some guy. Your brother and mother are killed by a man, and you go out on a journey to get sweet revenge. You go around and help people and you find clues to find the murderer. The story is a RPG, so you can choose what happens and that'll shape the world around you. Shall the military fight the Indians off their land, or will the Indians fall back, or can you make peace between the two? Shall the railroad go back to its former glory? You can decide. The murderer is randomized everytime, btw, so it has some good replay value there. Overall, it's a decent story.\n\nGAMEPLAY: The perspective is kind of like Dota 2, though it's not similar gameplay wise. You have your handy revolver. You cock it with one button, fire with another, and reload with a different one. If you get hit, your hat falls off. You usually have some spare ones, but if not, you are hatless. If you are hit then, you're dead and you wake up at your last spawn location with half of your cash gone. Decent enough, has some fun firefights and cool side activities, and it's good fun.\n\nGRAPHICS AND PERFORMANCE: 30fps, though with this game, that's fine. Runs smoothly. Game looks nice, has a nice pixely artstyle. It's charming, and it looks nice. That's nice to see.\n\nCHARACTERS AND DIALOGUE: Decent amount of variety. Your character is the usual player character, and you run across a lot of western stereotypes. The washed up sheriff, the girl who wants a man who can give her an adventerous life, the robbers who rob just for the hell of it. Fun little characters, some complexity to them as well. Nice to see some of them, I won't complain.\n\nFINAL RATING: Underrated game. Worth picking up on a sale without a doubt. 8.5/10, good game, nice debut for this studio.

But very zany, some great parody elements of the Spaghetti western genre, with a simple but overall compelling narrative that fits its theme.\nIt boils itself down to some simple elements to allow for a fair amount of diversity in how the paths can branch out. Unlike other games with a 'get quest' format, most missions will have some impact on the progression of the main storyline, so you can generally pick and choose what missions you want to pursue in order to reach the end goals, or complete them for their own merits. The main story is not really the meat of the game, but it's a satisfying chunk of narrative.\nThe gameworld is possibly one of the most reactive and natural I've played in any game. For example, there are no 'essential characters' that you cannot kill. when characters die, they stay dead, which can have real consequences for completing the game, and there's little to no railroading in how you have to complete certain tasks. Heck, you could be like me and end up triggering the end mission by complete fluke whilst doing something else. Even the tutorial is short, sweet and gets you to grips with the gameplay quickly while providing the first part of the story.\n\nThe soundtrack is delightfully western, but it can be a little too intense during times it shouldn't be. Walking around town should be a mellow track rather than the main theme playing in the background.\n\nGameplay is unorthadox, but very engaging when you get a handle on it. It's fast paced, hectic and relies on both reaction times and quick thinking. I would say this game has the gameplay that best fits the style of the 'gunslinger'. Greater precision allows you to regain health ('health' in a matter of speaking, westerado again has appropriated the spaghetti western style with it's combat system) and the combat blends nicely into the mechanics of the rest of the game (for example, you can draw your gun at any time while speaking with an npc).\n\nClassic pixel style graphics, but the art is well realised and the animations are smooth and vibrant. Very consistent aesthetics.\n\nOverall, if you've wanted a short but satisfying & replayable experience that caters to the old-west fan in you, Westerado delivers a very solid punch of the classic spaghetti western, which stays true to its core themes in all aspects.", "timestamp_created": 1449419399, "timestamp_updated": 1449419399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19510296": {"recommendationid": "19510296", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962082784", "num_games_owned": 1414, "num_reviews": 307, "playtime_forever": 775, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430790116}, "language": "english", "review": "An extremely replayable CYOA open world Wild West-themed shooter.

Hasta donde yo s\u00e9 no hay traducciones y parte del texto est\u00e1 en modo jerga (imitando en la escritura el estilo de hablar del oeste) por lo que si no te defiendes bien en la lengua de Shakespeare vas aviado.\n\nUn juego de mundo abierto pixelado, de vaqueros, con la cl\u00e1sica historia de venganza y misiones secundarias bastante bien llevadas dentro de las limitaciones de su presupuesto. El juego consiste en encontrar al asesino de tu familia. Para ello debes moverte por un mapa de tama\u00f1o medio hablando con la gente, aceptando misiones y encontrando pistas para averiguar el aspecto del asesino. Porque la gracia es esa: en cada partida el asesino cambia y puede ser cualquiera de los personajes con los que est\u00e1s hablando y que se mueven por el mapa. Cada misi\u00f3n que cumplas te ir\u00e1 dando una pista: el color de la chaqueta, que sombrero llevaba, si ten\u00eda pa\u00f1uelo, como era el cinto... hasta que tengas una imagen exacta y puedas localizar a ese mont\u00f3n de pixeles para hacer justicia.\n\nTiene cosas que me gustar\u00eda ver en juegos de m\u00e1s presupuesto, como una muy simple pero divertida: puedes cargarte a quien quieras, incluso en medio de una conversaci\u00f3n. Los di\u00e1logos tambi\u00e9n pueden variar si en el momento de estar hablando desenfundas tu arma. \n\nLas misiones secundarias se entrelazan entre si de forma que unas excluyen a otras para propiciar la rejugabilidad. Si ayudas a unos no podr\u00e1s ayudar a otros. Puedes jugar como un h\u00e9roe o como un bandido. Despu\u00e9s de todo la misi\u00f3n principal es cargarte al asesino de tu familia... nadie dijo que tuviera que ser algo limpio o que t\u00fa tuvieras que ser mejor que \u00e9l. \u00bfQu\u00e9 misiones hay? Pues de todo un poco: escoltar diligencias, capturar bandidos vivos o muertos, convencer a gente de que haga ciertas cosas (por las buenasm o a punta de pistola)... Pese a la limitaci\u00f3n del motor los desarrolladores se las han ingeniado para dar cierta sensaci\u00f3n de mundo abierto. \n\nLos combates son a la vieja usanza del oeste: un bot\u00f3n para enfundar/desenfundar, otro para amartillar el arma (primera pulsaci\u00f3n) y disparar (segunda pulsaci\u00f3n). Un tercer bot\u00f3n para recargar. Disparas siempre hacia los lados y hay cinco armas distintas (revolver, doble revolver, escopeta, rifle y boleadoras). Aunque parezca un poco limitado el sistema es chusco y cubre con creces las necesidades del juego. Aparte de eso tambi\u00e9n me ha gustado el fuego amigo: cuidado cuando dispares en zonas donde haya inocentes porque yo me qued\u00e9 sin completar una misi\u00f3n por ponerme nervioso y volarle la caebza a un par de 'colaboradores' confundi\u00e9ndolos con bandidos.\n\nEl juego no es muy largo si vas a pi\u00f1\u00f3n fijo a completar la misi\u00f3n principal. De hecho creo que hay un logro que es completarlo en menos de una hora. Pero si atendemos a rejugabilidad y a las misiones secundarias tienes para unas horas.

Which is fun, the first 2 or 3 times. But even the gunfights are surrounded by crap - the hats are your \"life points\", basically. You can either buy hats to refill them, or with skill, shoot them off of enemies and collect them, which would be super satisfying... if they didn't blow away after about 5 seconds of lying on the ground. Contrast this with the money that they drop, that remains even after you wander all around the map. So your skill is rendered useless, unless you do it within 5 seconds of clearing the enemies off a screen.\n\nThe quest tracking system would be nice, if I could tell the difference between someone giving a quest, and a quest destination. And some of the screens are pretty big (which would normally be a bonus), but there's no way to narrow it down between the potentially dozens of people you might talk to in order to turn something in.\n\nUltimately, this is a game that I WANT to be fun, because I see a ton of potential, but which un-fun keeps crowding and frustrating the fun out of.", "timestamp_created": 1448216771, "timestamp_updated": 1448216771, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.734036", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19069510": {"recommendationid": "19069510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127862616", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489850926}, "language": "english", "review": "I killed everyone in the saloon.

Redemption (I guess)\ntags: open world, choices, unique concept\n[/b]\n\nI could easily give Westerado a much better score, even a 10/10, the foundation of this game is really really good, I wish there were triple A games with this concept, but the problem is what's on top of this foundation. The problem is not quality, but quantity. There are 4 or 5 medium sized quest lines and that's it. One would expect there are many many small side quests you can do for random people, maybe even randomly generated, but nope, only a handful of people will have a conversation with you. One thing you can do as side missions is bounty hunting, and that's great, that's the type of thing the game needs more of. \nUnfortunately even those 4-5 medium sized quest lines aren't THAT different to each other, either shoot these guys or those guys. There are also quests which force you to choose a side. That means you won't be able to do everything in your first playthrough, which encourages multiple playthroughs. However after my first playthrough I really had to squeeze out every little piece of content left in the game.\nOne thing this game does really well is it`s world. It has a good size, enough variety and while being very open it also has some secret areas and some areas you have to \"unlock\" first which gives the sense of progress. However as I said the world is a bit empty. I know what I'm demanding from the developers is a lot of work, but that is how it is for great games isn't it? I'm always the most dissapointed when a game wastes so much potential. Maybe there will be an expansion or a sequel in the future?\nSurprisingly the shooting mechanics are actually really nice and don't get old quickly. You can only shoot horizontally and there are only 4 different weapons, but every weapon has it's advantages and disadvantages and while you have infinite ammo, reloading puts you in great danger so you really have to be careful not to waste your bullets and when to reload. It reminded me of how you have to time your health potions in Dark Souls. \nThis could be one of those 1st class indie games like Transistor, Banner Saga or Shovel Knight, but there is simply missing too much and I don't think for it's full price it's worth it really. I bought it for 7,5\u20ac and still wasn't 100% satisfied, so I recommend waiting until it's 5\u20ac or less.\n\nPlease make a huge expansion or a sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1445838547, "timestamp_updated": 1445838547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505024", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18685301": {"recommendationid": "18685301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136864736", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445732434}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth every penny.

Malheureusement le r\u00e9sultat est pour moi clairement en demi-teinte. On a l\u00e0 un jeu sympatoche au premier essai mais qui tr\u00e8s vite devient vraiment lassant.\n\n+Prise en main. Le gameplay est tr\u00e8s facile \u00e0 prendre en main et \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser, c'est tr\u00e8s intuitif.\n+Les musiques. Bien que peu nombreuses, elles sont agr\u00e9ables et renforcent bien l'immersion.\n+Le concept. Le coup du meurtrier changeant \u00e0 chaque fois est cool, l'univers western est plut\u00f4t sympatoche avec des personnages poss\u00e9dant un humour qui sait \u00e0 certains moments faire mouche mais \u00e0 d'autres fait simplement v\u00e9ritablement stupide dans le mauvais sens.\n\n-Graphismes. Les jeux ind\u00e9s avec des graphismes tr\u00e8s typ\u00e9s pixels ne me d\u00e9rangent pas du tout.

Ils sont pas terribles et jurent vraiment avec le reste.\n-R\u00e9p\u00e9titivit\u00e9. Le jeu est VRAIMENT r\u00e9p\u00e9titif. On a l'impression de faire la m\u00eame chose en boucle, le fait que la map ne soit pas tr\u00e8s grande et ne change pas de partie en partie rend le tout encore plus redondant. Les qu\u00eates sont les m\u00eames et si la premi\u00e8re partie peut \u00eatre boucl\u00e9e en 1H30 (ce qui en soit est extr\u00eamement court!), les autres peuvent se faire en deux fois moins de temps. C'est vraiment tr\u00e8s faible comme dur\u00e9e de vie. Les combats eux sont toujours les m\u00eames et aucun n'a de vari\u00e9t\u00e9.\n-Facilit\u00e9. Un combat peut se r\u00e9sumer en deux actions: Rester immobile/Tirer sur le mec quand il vient se mettre devant vous, ce qu'il fera toujours. Si en plus vous acheter le double flingue,ce sera encore plus rapide.\n-Bugs. J'en ai rencontr\u00e9 plusieurs lors de mon temps de jeu, dont certains ont vraiment pourris mon exp\u00e9rience de jeu, comme ceux m'emp\u00eachant de r\u00e9aliser une qu\u00eate parce que on ne peut pas parler \u00e0 tel ou tel perso.\n-Le prix. 15\u20ac pour ce jeu c'est beaucoup BEAUCOUP trop.

Ah don' think it's worth the full amount, but if you can get it on sale, you have a nice little game to play.\n\nStory - 7/10 - Yer family gets killed by a person, and you have to go kill that person. The story does make you want to play, but it ain't too original. The cool thing about it is that the person that killed your family changes every time, so you ain't gonna know who the killer is ferever.\n\nGraphics - 7/10 - Nothin' to write home bout'. It looks fine, and there ain't any glitches in animation as far as ah can tell, but somethin' feels a little lackluster bout' it. It ain't gonna fect' the gameplay though.\n\nGameplay - 9/10 - The gameplay is very simple. There are 3 parts of the game. Movin', Shootin' and Talkin'.\nMovin' - You move round'. This is bearable cause' you has a run button and there's an open world to explore, even though the world ain't very big. \nShootin' - You shoot people. The Combat is fun cause' there are multiple weapons to use, but you can only shoot left er' right, which is a weird design choice.\nTalkin' - You talk to people. Most of the time you will do one of 3 things. Help, Ignore, or Threaten. You can git missions and sist' people with jobs or be a little varmint and walk away. The fun things that you can do are accusin' people of murderin' yer family or pull out a gun and have the option to shoot em'. Pullin' out your gun may lead you to new dialougue options, but'll get you into a gunfight 50% of the time. It's yer choice!\n\nOverall - 8/10 - Westerado's a nice little game that doesn't last too long, but it packs punch, like ah shotgun to the hat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(P.S.

You can draw and shoot whenever and whoever you like, whether that be the murderer that killed your family, a bandit who's hideout you've stumbled into, the town Sheriff or even your own Uncle's ghost. It's perfect for all your serial killing needs.\nMy only real issue with this game is how once you kill all the badits the map becomes a barren wasteland, and you can easily complete the main storyline within 10 minutes. Fortunately, the game is littered with sidequests and areas, and it will take a good few hours to fully explore every inch of the map. (I still haven't gotten EVERYWHERE).\nOverall it's a very fun game to just boot up and play, with simple to learn controls. it has a ton of achievements for the perfectionists of the world, with a high amount of replay value. Also, you can walk into a rancher's farm, set all of his buffalo free, shoot his wife and generaly ruin his life and career forever, so that's fun. (I recommend not doing this in your first playthrough though, ranchers have all the information in the world when it comes to your family's killer)", "timestamp_created": 1444510404, "timestamp_updated": 1444510404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18416805": {"recommendationid": "18416805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135743252", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496423542}, "language": "english", "review": "open world \nwestern \nRPG \nco-op \ncrazy awesome music \nbeatiful visuals \n\na must have game", "timestamp_created": 1444506450, "timestamp_updated": 1444506450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467938", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18360162": {"recommendationid": "18360162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006433101", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 1104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444183015}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome - buy it", "timestamp_created": 1444165582, "timestamp_updated": 1444165582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18323238": {"recommendationid": "18323238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147071340", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466120611}, "language": "english", "review": "Way Of The Samurai: Desperado Edition", "timestamp_created": 1443953079, "timestamp_updated": 1443953079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18282910": {"recommendationid": "18282910", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135404020", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506915070}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved the original flash version.

You take on the role of a gunslinger who is tasked with hunting down his families killer. \n\nThe way in which you complete this task differs from other games in my view; you have to find clues about the identity of the culprit by completing missions and objectives for locals around the towns. This really adds to the mystery behind the killer. Even the options menu has a screen dedicated to showing you all the clues you have found along with a model of a character showing the clues on, such as a \"fat, blue shirt, medium sized hat\" figure for example.  These clues are all randomly generated each playthrough as well. \n\nAnother really new feature in Westerado is the that you can draw your gun at anytime, even during a conversion with any NPC, this can sometimes trigger a different set of dialogue, initiate a new quest, or just go completely wrong and end up in a gun fight. This also means you can kill anyone in the story too, no matter how important they are to the plot, anyone can die.\n\nThe main gameplay is a top down action game, in good old western style, you have your gun which you have to manually reload every six shots, or you can upgrade it to a big ol shotgun. The gunfights can sometimes feel a little bit clunky, but once you get used to the controls and how the game responds to them, it soon becomes clear and easily executed.  Another one of my favorite parts of the game would be the buffalo scenes; riding horse back defending carriages from bandits on a buffalo's, although simple, it is really compelling to play.\n\nWesterado has a very clever story, and has all the main plot points that any good western film will have in it. Although you can make the story different each time you play, for instance just killing one of the main quest givers, I am not sure it actually changes the whole outcome of the game, I think all that will happen is you'll just miss out on those quests rather it have an effect on the grand scheme of things. \n\nThe world in which you play in is huge, it's set out like a very Zelda style map, each tile on the map has four entry points, north, west, south and east. This makes navigating across the map very easy and you can always make your way to where you need to be very quickly. Each of the zones look amazing too; lots of detail has gone into adding plenty of objects, background items and scenery to add to the western feel. Although the graphics are the ever growing popular, pixelated style, it still has a really nice look to it. \n\nLength wise, Westerado can be over and done with in less than an hour if you just do the main story, which is actually what I did on my first playthrough. However it is highly recommended that you don't just do that, as you are missing out on tons of content in the side missions, along with loads of story too. There is so much to see in Westerado if you just take the time to explore. \n\nObviously there are no technical problems that I ran into, as this game is actually based on a Flash game, so it will run on anything - only thing is that it runs at 30fps (which you may or may not notice in this type of game). \n\n[b][u] Tom's Score Card[/u][/b]\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n[b][u]3) Recommended[/u][/b]\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It features many unique mechanics, a great aesthetic, side quests that don't suck, but the thing that really stands out to me is how well fleshed out the world is.

The way the side quests tie together different characters and open up new opportunities feels organic and makes the world feel alive. Plus, it has local co-op!

To end this review on a high note, I'll get through the negative parts first.\n\nTo start, this game is NOT worth 15 euro. If Westerado is on sale, go ahead and buy it. If you like the sound of it after what this review tells you, go and buy it. If you're looking for a long experience and you don't have much money to spend, I'd say that Westerado isn't for you.\n\nThat being said, the game has an unfortunately short playtime. Start to finish with a few of the sidequests in between lasts you about 2-3 hours. That being said, exploring around, interacting with the NPCs and truly doing everything that the game has to offer will last you an extra 2-3 hours on top of the original playtime. Altogether, you can get a truly immersive 6 hours of entertainment from this game in total. Unfortunately little.\n\nThat's about it for the negative side, other than one tiny bug that really didn't affect gameplay at all. Instead of my money displaying in the money GUI, it displayed below it. Any money that I picked up went into the money GUI with the total amount I had before banking it being below the GUI, saying \"+X\", X being the money I was carrying at the time. It didn't affect gameplay, it was just like normal. Forget about it. Now, moving on to the good part.\n\nThis game is oddly immersive. I blame the soundtrack. Listening to that beautiful opening theme and then hearing it again in certain other areas, it almost made me proud of my character at the end, despite the fact he was a murderous bastard (In my defense, they all fired first. The fact that I pointed and cocked a gun at their face is beside the point)\n\nNext up, the game offers quite a lot of freedom to do things however you want to. Do you have to convince someone to deliever his buffalo to an army fortress? Well, you can do a little job for him and then help to defend the buffalo from bandits like an upstanding citizen, or you can threaten him at gunpoint and force him to deliver them. This goes for pretty much every quest in the game. You can be forceful and violent to get what you want, or you can actually be a helpful citizen.\n\nNext up, the whole system of finding \"The Murderer\" the main antagonist, is pretty fun. It can just appear out of nowhere, that guy you've been hunting for the last two hours. You might suddenly stumble upon someone who resembles him and then realize \"Wait, that couldn't be... the murderer?\". Not only do you have to constantly match people with his description and generally keep an eye out for him, but you've gotta go on a big quest for information, narrowing down potential suspects until you can find and accuse the right person.\n\nThe shooting mechanics in this game are oddly satisfying. Although they only work on a 2D Plane and you can only shoot in straight lines, it's pretty suspenseful. Buying new weapons and using them keeps the experience fresh and interesting along the way.\n\nThe game also has a small open world. You can go across the entire map back and forth in about two minutes, but with all the quests, NPCs and other distractions throughout the world, you'll stray from the main quest and end up spending three to four hours at the game anyway.\n\nBasically, if you've got some money to spare and want to experience an interesting story and a 2D Red Dead Redemption with all the traditional Wild West activites, get this game.", "timestamp_created": 1439416975, "timestamp_updated": 1439416975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17495426": {"recommendationid": "17495426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132480699", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 7285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472771497}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't stop whistling the theme!

The story is pretty generic, but the attention to detail is great. Lots of secrets hidden all over the place (Also, did I mention, \"more secrets?\" because there are MORE than lots of secrets hidden away that are great to discover). The music sounds nice, but I personally wouldn't listen to it very long, as it goes from nice to being slightly annoying after hearing it for over two hours straight. The graphics, though extremely simplistic, look great, and remind me of the GBA versions of Pokemans. I like the way the social interactions work in-game, and how so many of the characters are interconnected in different ways to each other. The gameplay mechanics (and controls), though slightly unorthodox, are great to use with a little practice. My only real complaint is the multiplayer (co-op if you're wondering, though friendly fire is possible). Apart from being able to help out in firefights, \"Player 2\" has a lot less ability to do stuff than player one. Player 2 can't open dialogues, and nor can he/she go very far from player one (They need to be in the same region, and only player one can move the camera to different places).

The thing I love about this game is its open world nature, and your ability to kill anyone at any point. This ads a lot of variety to an already varied world with lots of things to do. You can do bounty quests, kill random people for money, and even play a few(or many) hands of poker. The world is so varied, and has a vast array of side quests. It reminds me of something like Morrowind, where you can kill any character at any time and it can impact your story. To show an example of some variety, I'm going to tell part of my adventure in the next paragraph. It will contain some spoilers, jump ahead to the next paragraph if you wish to avoid them\n\n[h1] Spoiler Warning [/h1]\nI was doing some side quests to try and find more information about my killer. Your killer is randomized, which is one of the cool things about this game. You can't just memorize the details of the killer and do it every time, it will be different each time. Anyway, I'm told by the banker to find the ranchers and get the money he needs to pay off the Oil Tycoon man. So I go to each of them, and I end up slaughtering all of the ranchers. I had no idea what this would do. There are several quests that ask you to get help from the ranchers, or even recruit them. I had to skip these parts, or simply fail the quest because they were already dead. I decided that this was all the Oil Tycoon mans fault, so I decided to pay him a visit after acquiring a rifle. which is in my opinion the best weapon in the game(that I've found). I slaughter his men and him as well, and steal his stash of money. Feeling well rewarded, I return to the bank to find the Bank owner now wants nothing to do with me, I think because I killed the ranchers. This would have went very differently depending on my choices.\n[b] Spoiler end [/b]\n\nBased on that story, you can see how many different paths you can take. If you skipped it based on spoilers, just trust me, it is a world were your choice matters. Another great element is the ability to pull out your gun in the middle of any conversation, making dialogue very interesting. Westerado is a great game for those on a budget looking for an open world that rivals any AAA game.\n\nPros:\n-Strongly woven together open world\n-Multiple side quests and other things to do\n-Choices with NPC's matter\n-Several different hats with different functions\n-Optional fast travel(works similar to Morrowind)\n-Guns for different situations\n-Variety in the environment\n-Randomized bounty hunter missions\n\nCons:\n-Main story is very short if you find your killer quickly enough\n-Some bugs, One of them required me to quit and restart from an earlier autosave\n-Pixel graphics can occasionally(not often) make it hard to see your bounty target.\n\n[h1][u] Wait For A Sale [h1][u]", "timestamp_created": 1431377314, "timestamp_updated": 1454548263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.823408", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15788923": {"recommendationid": "15788923", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997152026", "num_games_owned": 743, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431359321}, "language": "russian", "review": "- 6/10 - \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445!

Sorprend\u00eda su extensi\u00f3n, teniendo en cuenta el formato, y la ambici\u00f3n de sus creadores, los holandeses Ostrich Banditos, para atreverse a colar su juego s\u00f3lo a trav\u00e9s de la web de Adult Swim.\n\nAl igual que me pas\u00f3 en cuanto prob\u00e9 la primera iteraci\u00f3n de Gods Will Be Watching, empec\u00e9 a llorar en Twitter para que hubiera un \u201cjuego completo\u201d. Nadie me hizo caso, pero mira, alguien m\u00e1s debi\u00f3 pensarlo y hace bien poco que puede jugarse a este Westerado: Double Barreled. Una versi\u00f3n hipervitaminada del original, m\u00e1s extensa, con la posibilidad de grabar partida (en navegador no se pod\u00eda) y juego cooperativo.\n\nBendita idea.\n\nAunque ese periodo hist\u00f3rico al que llamamos \u201cSalvaje Oeste\u201d ni era tan salvaje ni tan homog\u00e9neo, ha sido una brutal mina de la que ir sacando pel\u00edculas y libros. Y, en menor medida, videojuegos. M\u00e1s en las anteriores generaciones que en estas \u00faltimas, que si acaso nos tra\u00edan alg\u00fan que otro FPS y poco m\u00e1s. Lleg\u00f3, por supuesto, Red Dead Redemption (que jam\u00e1s apareci\u00f3 en PC) y estamos esperando a Hard West y 12 is better than 6, pero segu\u00eda habiendo cierta orfandad de t\u00edtulos m\u00e1s centrados en la violenta vida en la frontera y las dificultades de su conquista.\n\nPrecisamente en eso es en lo que brilla Westerado: como peque\u00f1o simulador, cajita de arena en miniatura, con un mundo vulnerable a nuestras decisiones. Y la palabra es vulnerable. Por mucho que tengamos una misi\u00f3n principal (vengar a nuestra familia de un cuatrero desconocido que ha incendiado nuestro rancho y los ha acribillado a balazos), enseguida tendremos todo el escenario para nosotros, para hacer lo que nos d\u00e9 la gana con \u00e9l. Y eso incluye jodernos la partida. Esto no es uno de esos juegos de rol en los que los personajes que dan misiones son inmortales, aqu\u00ed la misma bala que mata a un bandolero se lleva por delante al Sheriff o a la due\u00f1a de la tienda que nos vende sombreros (la peculiar \u201cbarra de vida\u201d). BAM, ya no podremos comprarle nada.\n\nEstoy seguro de que hay quien no lo meter\u00eda en el saco de los juegos de rol, porque no hay ni ficha, ni inventario ni subidas de nivel\u2026 Pero lo m\u00e1s importante de este tipo de juegos, que es el ponerse en la piel del personaje, est\u00e1 m\u00e1s que cubierto.\n\nQuiz\u00e1 nos aburramos de la misi\u00f3n principal y decidamos mediar en una guerra entre indios y soldados. O nos d\u00e9 por asaltar ranchos (o protegerlos). O qu\u00e9 s\u00e9 yo, quiz\u00e1 s\u00f3lo emular a un jodido asesino que se pase por la piedra a media ciudad y aterrorice a la gente all\u00e1 por donde va, consumido por la rabia y la inacci\u00f3n de sus vecinos ante los abusos. La elecci\u00f3n es nuestra y no se nos va a impedir nada. Pero tampoco se nos librar\u00e1 de las consecuencias.\n\nPero pongamos que estamos ante todo centrados en vengarnos del malnacido que arruin\u00f3 a nuestra familia. En un mundo en el que nadie tiene cara (literalmente), s\u00f3lo tendremos una forma de encontrarlo: averiguando poco a poco c\u00f3mo es su aspecto. Partimos con una pista inicial que nos dar\u00e1 nuestro hermano antes de morir, y tras eso tendremos que irnos asegurando la confianza de la gente para que desembuchen m\u00e1s datos. Como jugando a un \u201cQui\u00e9n es qui\u00e9n\u201d cargado de polvo y balas. As\u00ed iremos componiendo el Frankenstein de sombrero, pa\u00f1uelo, chaqueta, cintur\u00f3n y pantalones que se genera de manera procedural en cada partida.\n\nLo m\u00e1s curioso es que a\u00fan no teniendo los datos exactos sobre el asesino podremos ir acusando a la gente en cada conversaci\u00f3n (o desenfundando el rev\u00f3lver). Quiz\u00e1 acertemos, pero lo m\u00e1s seguro es que acabemos teniendo un malentendido y balasera al atardecer.\n\nLa otra parte fundamental de Westerado son, obviamente, los tiroteos. No son nada dif\u00edciles y se ejecutan s\u00f3lo en posici\u00f3n horizontal, pero hay que tener cuidado con los tiempos e ir bien provisto de sombreros. El m\u00e1ximo de \u201cvidas\u201d ser\u00e1n los tres que podemos llevar, que salen volando con cada tiro, hasta dejarnos la cabeza descubierta. Otro disparo m\u00e1s nos matar\u00e1. Nuestros enemigos ser\u00e1n numerosos, pero no tan afortunados: si apuntamos bien podremos volarles el sombrero (y as\u00ed recogerlo del suelo para \u201crecargar la vida\u201d), pero si no, con un disparo se ir\u00e1n al otro barrio.\n\nResulta muy satisfactorio enfrentarse a una horda de brutos en medio de las minas y salir de all\u00ed indemne, pero estad seguros de que tarde o temprano nuestra suerte acabar\u00e1. Puede ser una bala perdida que impacte a un ciudadano (y nos ponga a todo el pueblo en contra) o un tiro que nos lleve a la tumba (s\u00f3lo para frenarnos y hacernos perder dinero, antes de continuar). Siempre pasa algo en Westerado.\n\nEn un juego en el que es tan importante el escenario y las posibilidades que da, \u00e9ste merece una menci\u00f3n especial. Es ese Oeste mitol\u00f3gico de Sergio Leone, de eterno conflicto, agua esquiva y calor pedregoso. El uso que hace Westerado de las paletas de color anaranjadas y de su propia banda sonora (de nuevo homenaje al italiano) crea un ambiente perfecto, con el que es casi posible oler el polvo de la llanura y el entrechocar de los cascos de los caballos.\n\nAh\u00ed est\u00e1 la clave del juego: es como ponerse a ver un spaghetti western para poco despu\u00e9s de empezar calarse el sombrero y las botas y sustituir al amigo Clint. Para un juego de dimensiones tan peque\u00f1as y los m\u00ednimos elementos, es casi abrumadora la cantidad de cosas que nos propone y deja hacer, siempre sin juzgar pero siempre generando una respuesta merecida. Es altamente rejugable y guarda unas cuantas sorpresas, y no est\u00e1 exento de sentido del humor.

Unlike WotS, however, you're not free to just do whatever and leave whenever you like, though you can easily break the storyline and just murder everyone if you so choose. There seem to be a number of scripted events that can occur in reaction to your behavior, in lieu of following the main storyline, but it doesn't really address the fact that once you break the storyline, there's no real way to \"finish\" the game in many circumstances, the way that you can choose to just leave town in WotS. The game doesn't seem to have a \"New Game +\" state, however, so maybe it doesn't matter whether or not you can \"complete\" it; completing the game simply leaves that file permanently loading just before the final battle, requiring you to start a new game in a new slot to access your unlocked characters and the like, or else delete the original file.\n\nCombat interestingly requires you to cock your gun before each shot, and manually reload each bullet, but still manages to be INCREDIBLY easy. Often what will kill you will be battles that drag out over an incredibly lengthy series of areas, terribly cramped rooms with no space to maneuver, or wild animals, who take one life just by touching you.\n\nUnfortunately, the \"randomly generated killer\" that the game boasts seems to always be a generic, nameless NPC that wanders around one of the two towns, rather than one of the named characters with actual dialogue and characterization.\n\nWorth picking up, though considering the 2-3 hour length, and that I saw most of the game's content in a single 2.5 hour playthrough, maybe not for $15.\n\nHas an unexpectedly excellent soundtrack that, while unavailable for sale through Steam, can be picked up at the artist's bandcamp: https://samvanlonkhuyzen.bandcamp.com/album/westerado-double-barreled-ost", "timestamp_created": 1430809784, "timestamp_updated": 1430810856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15693323": {"recommendationid": "15693323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148415739", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507601919}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the game itself.It is amazing.

Bisher habe ich auch noch nicht viele gespielt. Obwohl das so ist, war \"Westerado: Double Barreled\" das bisher beste! Man kann die Liebe, die in jedem Detail dieses Spiels steckt, f\u00f6rmlich sp\u00fcren. Die Grafik finde ich pers\u00f6nlich richtig sch\u00f6n und zum Spiel absolut passend, ebenso die Musik und Soundeffekte. Von der Athmosph\u00e4re ganz zu schweigen. Die ist n\u00e4mlich sehr gelungen, man f\u00fchlt sich wirklich wie im wilden Westen.\n\nIm Prinzip geht es in diesem Spiel nur darum, den Kerl zu finden, der deine Ranch und deine Familie umgenietet hat. Allerdings musst du dich um den ein oder anderen Gefallen k\u00fcmmern, um herauszufinden, wie der M\u00f6rder aussieht. Nach den meisten gel\u00f6sten Quests erh\u00e4lt man einen Hinweis auf sein Aussehen. Hat man alles herausgefunden, so muss man ihn nur noch finden und zum Kampf herausfordern.\n\nWas die Quests angeht: niemand wird es beim ersten Durchlauf schaffen, alle zu erledigen (wenn das \u00fcberhaupt m\u00f6glich ist). Zudem ist es oft auch gar nicht so einfach, die Quests \u00fcberhaupt zu erledigen. Zumindest ging es mir so. Das liegt zum gro\u00dfen Teil wohl auch daran, dass ich das, was die NPCs gesagt haben, einfach nicht gelesen habe, was nicht an meinen Englischkenntnissen, sondern an meiner Ungeduld liegt. Nicht, dass die Dialoge nicht ganz nett w\u00e4ren, aber an sich interessiert mich sowas nur selten.\n\nVom Kampfsystem bin ich absolut \u00fcberzeugt! Simpel, aber es macht Laune. Echtzeitk\u00e4mpfe mit einer Hand voll Waffen, darunter ein Revolver, eine Schrotflinte und Doppel-Revolver, dann gibt es noch ein Werkzeug, um die Gegner zu fesseln, habe ich jedoch nie ausprobiert. Au\u00dferdem kann man jeden NPC t\u00f6ten, was wiederum Konsequenzen hat.\n\nLaut Steam habe ich 4,5 Stunden gespielt (Steam z\u00e4hlt die Spielzeit ja sehr komisch, denn in Wirklichkeit ist meine Spielzeit noch geringer). F\u00fcr mich hat es sich aber deutlich l\u00e4nger angef\u00fchlt. Ich habe zwar bei weitem nicht alle Quests erledigt, aber die Spielzeit ist meines Erachtens in Hinblick auf den Preis von 14,99 \u20ac zu kurz. Jedoch sollte dazu gesagt werden, dass der Wiederspielwert relativ hoch ist, weil man auf keinen Fall zweimal das selbe Erlebnis haben wird! Ein zweiter Durchgang ist aber nat\u00fcrlich nichts f\u00fcr jeden. Trotzdem empfinde ich pers\u00f6nlich das Verh\u00e4ltnis aus M\u00d6GLICHER Spielzeit und Preis als durchaus in Ordnung! Letzten Endes z\u00e4hlt sowieso das Gesamterlebnis.\n\nFazit: Ich bin mehr als nur angetan! Die Athmosp\u00e4hre und das spa\u00dfige Gameplay ergeben ein Spielerlebnis, das sich vom h\u00e4ufig aufzufindenden Einheitsbrei der modernen Spiele absetzt. Ein klassisches Beispiel daf\u00fcr, dass viel Technik f\u00fcr ein gutes Spiel nicht von N\u00f6ten ist.", "timestamp_created": 1430164302, "timestamp_updated": 1430164463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.673505", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15574732": {"recommendationid": "15574732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106825427", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436063711}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't had this much fun playing a western game since Red Dead Redemption. Westerado: Double Barreled is a game about getting revenge on the bandit that burned down your home and murdered your family. The game thrust you into the west with nothing more than a hat and revolver and tell you find killer.\n\nYou must go through out the west completing quests for various people to get enough information to successfully identify the killer. The killer is random NPC, so his appearance change every playthrough. You can kill anyone in the game, so if you choose to just go on a rampage till you get the right one that could be an option. The missions can range from protecting a herd of buffalo, working with natives to take on the rangers, or clearing out a cave full of bandits. The combat allow you to shoot in either the left or right direction and you can move up and down to avoid gun fire. Hats are the system health system. The more hats you have the more hits can take, but once you run out the next hit will be fatal. \n\nThis game sound and feel like a western. It got so many winks and nods to westerns, there no way I could get through them all. Heck the main town is name Clintville, and they even manage to throw in a Doctor Who reference. But I digress. The game set the mood as western film, and with the game being an open sandbox you can really explore the west. Also the soundtrack is just amazing, never had I wish to download a OST as much as with this game. \n\nOnce the game have been completed under certain conditions you can unlock up to 3 additional characters, all with their own unique play style. Combine this with the fact that you can buy guns in games, along with clothes, and a house and well let just say you can get a lot of mileage out this game.\n\nHonestly I like the western setting in game and feel it an underrated genre.

The music is beyond amazing and perfectly fits the game. The story of the game is great, it's a murder mystery with a completely baffling twist ending.\n\nThe point of the game is to do quest to find out what the murderer looks likes. Some quest involve just serving some good ol' western justice. Others involve helping a ghost. The game is short, only lasting about an hour at most. It has to be short becasue that's where the replayability comes in. each time you complete the game, the murderer switches to one of the hundreds of NPCs in the game. One time it could be a fat rich man, and the next it could be a skinny yellow bellied outlaw. \n\nThe NPCs are all interactable. They have a reaction to almost anything you do. If you draw a weapon, they will match. If you pull the hammer they may very well shoot you, or it could be a quickdraw. You have the the choice of being an outlaw, by killing civilians or anyhting that moves, or you can be a justice seeking law bringer, seeking out the worst outlaws and wiping their mark off the face of the wild west. \n\nI do have a few nitpicks though. \n-There are only 4 weapons in the game.\n-The quest are the same each time around, (although you probably won't finish all of them on your first time around)\n\nEven with these, the game is still great.

Red Dead Redemption's name was invoked several times when I was briefly scouting around to see if the game was any good, and I can see the comparison in that sense. It does have a way of grabbing you.\n\nI do really appreciate this game's extreme open-endedness, and how basically no two games will be alike. Seems a lot like any NPC can die - I was a little surprised to find the Oil Tycoon dead after a skirmish in his office - and there are tons of quests with all manners of outcomes. All the quests are there to give you information to go after that one true goal, though: Get the Bad Guy. For that reason, when I Got the Bad Guy for the first time, I had quite a few open quests that didn't seem to be going anywhere, some that didn't even appear to still have objectives. That was kind of unsatisfying, but I guess it makes sense that this amount of open-endedness won't button up all neatly at the end like RDR. Fair enough. \n\nGetting Bad Guy took me right around five hours, and I'm a slow-paced player prone to spending significant periods of time just hanging around and looking cool. But I'm sure there's a lot more content to be explored, so I'll have to give it another shot. \n\nThe gameplay itself isn't really anything special, but it's not bad either. My major frustrations came around with those damn scorpions in and around the desert, and a really annoying endgame. It's pretty neat how your gun controls stay the same during conversations. The weapons are fairly satisfying. Really not much to argue about, but also not really the game's focus.\n\nDo I recommend it? Sure, but I have to admit the endgame payoff didn't seem like much compared to the trip. I got it on a sale, and I might recommend that, but really I don't think it'll steer you wrong.

I personally love most of the soundtrack, fitting the western setting with ease. The only gripe I have with the game is the combat, which is lackluster, and the length-for-price. I beat the game the first time through in about forty-five minutes or so, and the rest of the play time was me playing through and exploring the land.

For example, there is a bank in this game where you store your money. If you kill the banker and the tellers, then it opens up the safe full of money. Little things like this I love. And once you leave the bank, the entire town starts going after you becasue you killed their banker, thus creating full-on mayhem.

Selbst die knapp 7 Stunden, die ich nun mit dem Spiel verbracht habe, beinhalteten nicht nur einen, sondern gleich mehrere Neustarts und entsprechend sollte jedem K\u00e4ufer bewusst sein, dass der Umfang von Westerado trotz allem Wiederspielwert nicht gerade gro\u00df ist.\nAber das ist leider nicht der Hauptquell f\u00fcr Frustration.

One day, a buffalo escapes from your family ranch. You decide to go after it to catch and bring it back, but at return, you see the ranch burning down, your mother dead and your brother as good as dead. He makes you swear for revenge after he asks you to put him out of his misery. With nowhere to stay, you meet up with your uncle.\n\nAnd now you do whatever you want.\n\nObviously, this is a tale of reveange and of the wild old west, so you are free to do as you please. The game is structured after missions you can get from different NPCs which can be morally ambiguous, so technically you can become a hero, a renegade or a neutral mercenary, which is a freedom I always welcome, but the goal of the game is set on taking reveange on whoever did what they did to your family, and each mission completed will give you money and a hint on how that son of a b*tch looks like. Slowly you'll puzzle together their appearance, and exact your vengeance on them. Each playthrough the culprit takes on a new appearance, allowing for multiple playthroughs, along with unlockable characters, which all come with a different weapon besides the revolver.\n\nThe graphics try to invoke a classic charm, and most of the time succeed, but at points I couldn't help but think they were just ugly and messy. Personally, I really enjoyed the shooting animation. The way the gun powder disperses into the air looks amazingly detailed, and the line in which your bullet travels appears briefly but long enough to have an idea were you are shooting at and how much you need to adjust. Since the combat here is hectic and, surprisingly, very tactical, I appreciate this game design choice as it is fast and intuitive, whereas maybe the absence of the limitation of the horizontal fighting lock would have lead to a lot of frustration. \n\nYes, to fight it out here you get somewhat locked into a horizontal combat. Let me try to explain: you can only shoot in a straight line exactly 90\u00b0 to the left or right. Your enemies naturally share this same condition. Add to this a health system that counts your \"lifes\" as \"hats\" (you have up to three), and for each time you are hit, you lose one hat. And let me tell you, the population of the West has an humerous obsession with hats. Genre savvy as they are, they know that nobody should get into a fight without a hat, because once you are out of them, you lose half your money, all your bought weapons and restart at your uncle's. This is why I said that the combat in Westerado is tactical, positioning yourself is of uttermost importance: you need to get out of the line of enemy fire, and yet, you need to stay enough in front of them to be able to hit them with a straight shot. To encourage this engagement, each headshot you manage to hit doesn't kill your enemy, but makes him lose his hat that you can pick up to \"regenerate\" your hats. They can than either surrender to you or resume to shoot at you. It is a small detail but very intriguing, even more so because if you decide to play bounty hunter, you will need to deliver some bounties alive to the sheriff, so in other words your gunslining skills need to be good enough to land a perfect headshot if you want to deliver your outlaws alive.\n\nSimilarly, starting a ruckus in a town may make you unpopular to the point of making the townspeople try to get rid of you. Or you might kill enough people to make you feared among bandits, to the point of them starting to avoid conflict with you. It is those reactions that make the game so entertaining to replay in a different way than before, out of curiosity.\n\nThe open-world concept is awesome for a 2D game -- but the world feels too small. I managed to complete 150% of the map, that is, all the overworld plus the underground mines, on the very first day I played. And it just happened out of curiosity, I wasn't even aiming at discovering the whole map! There needed to be a lot more space to explore, it really just feels too small.\n\nI also missed some more interactive actions, as scavenging from corpses, item management or upgrades of any sort. I think in that aspect, Westerado could have taken some inspiration from the Fallout series. On the other hand, being able to threaten ANY NPC with my gun during conversation really fleshes out the Wild West experience. It may sometimes even be necessary, and the very first mission of the game teaches this smoothly.\n\nIt is a good game, but too small of a world, too short of a story and has ultimately too little to offer to spend longer than two or three days playing it. Which is not enough return for the price of it. I like this game, in fact, I like it a lot, but it could have been so much more. It feels like a game of wasted potential, but I'd still recommend it on sale as a game for in between those days you got nothing to do and are too lazy to start/continue that long quest of your actual favorite game.", "timestamp_created": 1429847131, "timestamp_updated": 1431184971, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570126", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15512091": {"recommendationid": "15512091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126130612", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469568143}, "language": "english", "review": "Ostrich Banditos, I expect better from you.

The gameplay is more about speaking with people, gathering clues and completing quests with the ultimately goal of finding a killer.\n\nAnyone expecting it to be like Titan Souls or Hotline Miami gameplay will be disappointed.

Watch our review here on Steam Punks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdZT8LH22n4\n\nWe\u2019ve seen our fair share of pixelated adventures, but none that honour its source material quite as well as Westerado: Double Barreled. Developer Ostrich Banditos has refined their free online game into a fully-featured spaghetti western. Is it an indie title worth saddling up for, or should you stay out of the desert heat?\n\nThe game\u2019s plot is set up quickly; a murderer burns down your ranch and kills your family almost as fast as you\u2019re introduced to them. Of course it\u2019s up to you to identify the mysterious killer and avenge your fallen kin. It seems the locals have their own issues as well, and can tell you about your notorious antagonist\u2019s appearance in exchange for whatever help you choose to give them. Overall the story isn\u2019t terribly interesting, but witty character dialogue helps carry the narrative along nicely.\n\nPlayers will spend a great deal of time interacting with townsfolk who reward you with hints and tips. Your choice of what to say in these conversations is abundant. While a lot of these will only alter simple lines of dialogue, it\u2019s often used effectively as avenues to find and complete new missions. People trade a piece of information on the villain\u2019s appearance for a completed mission, meaning once you\u2019ve helped enough characters you can set out to find the murderer without finishing your entire itinerary. Story progress actually depends upon not completing every quest you come across, as progress in some tasks may impede you in others. A rancher friend may want to rally farmers together for a franchise, but that could be difficult if you just finished killing half of them to release their buffalo for an Indian chief. The sort of fail state handling in missions like this is extraordinarily unique, putting a fresh spin on the quest-collecting adventure. Your choices will dictate your overall experience from beginning to end, each decision bearing permanent consequence. If you decided it was easier to kill the pony express driver than it was to pay him, don\u2019t expect to see him for the rest of your play through. Ultimately you can navigate around your failed missions and complete whatever is still possible in order to collect clues, but this level of gravity to your choices and failures feels real in a way that is rarely seen in games.\nIt\u2019s up to each player to decide how they want to get from one end of the game to the other, who to help and who to harm, and overall what kind of hero they want to be. Because of this, Westerado holds excessive replay-ability after your first run of the relatively short story is over. Though most will be able to complete the main story in about 4 or 5 hours, this is leaving many quests unsolved. The game\u2019s length becomes much longer for those who want to replay and see different paths, and you\u2019ll likely want to do this to experience the game\u2019s fascinating attention to detail rather than for any character\u2019s sake. While the locals make for some funny conversation, the writing isn\u2019t nearly as impressive as the carefully structured space out here in the desert. \n\nQuest givers are placed in thoughtful locations; you\u2019ll often finish one mission to immediately discover two more. There is the occasional fetch quest, but most tasks feel deeper than that, having you actively take part in the locals\u2019 problems through various mixes of exploration, action, and speech. There are a handful of different weapons to choose, from dual pistols to shotguns and rifles. Each have distinct capabilities and optimal situations to be used in. Money is tight, so the addition of the shooting range to find which gun suits your preference is appreciated. Something quickly noticeable in the gunplay is the restriction from shooting up or down; characters can only fire left to right. While this seems limiting at first, it actually makes for entertaining cinematic 16 \u2013 bit shootouts as black bars enclose the screen during your conflicts to emphasize the showdown.\n\nThe atmosphere the game goes so far to create is done with expert care. The pixel art has been masterfully crafted; the environments are a beauty to marvel, and character models convey a surprising level of detail for their simplicity. Accompanying songs are magnificent but few, with live recorded instruments helping to carry your adventure along. Each song is excellently chosen for their attached location, but the main over-world theme may start to drone on during extended sittings. Nearly every western set piece imaginable is present; you\u2019ll visit the sheriff to get the news on outlaws, the pony express to make a delivery, and maybe even the nearby saloon to take a load off and play some poker.\n\nIt might be a short trip, Westerado: Double Barreled is a must-have for indie lovers. It\u2019s an experience that handles atmosphere, decision-making, and comedic narrative better than most big-budget releases. It\u2019s definitely worth ponying up for this adventure.\n\nSCORE: 8.5\n", "timestamp_created": 1429770346, "timestamp_updated": 1429770346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15499427": {"recommendationid": "15499427", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971525180", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517031335}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game, fantastic humor.

Espero que ajude voc\u00eas.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nHist\u00f3ria:\nVoc\u00ea \u00e9 o filho mais novo de uma rancheira, e junto de seu irm\u00e3o, voc\u00ea ajuda sua m\u00e3e a criar os b\u00fafalos do rancho. Um dia, enquanto voc\u00ea ajuda seu irm\u00e3o a conduzir a manada, um b\u00fafalo foge. Seu irm\u00e3o pede que voc\u00ea o traga de volta. Voc\u00ea faz como lhe foi pedido, mas quando volta se depara com seu rancho em chamas, sua m\u00e3e morta, e seu irm\u00e3o ferido. Ap\u00f3s conversar com seu irm\u00e3o, ele lhe conta como tudo aconteceu, e ainda lhe d\u00e1 algumas caracter\u00edsticas do assassino. Voc\u00ea, ent\u00e3o, come\u00e7a uma ca\u00e7ada, procurando se vingar da pessoa que matou sua fam\u00edlia. Para saber mais sobre o assassino, voc\u00ea tem que prestar favores \u00e0s pessoas, e ao longo que voc\u00ea ajuda os personagens, eles te d\u00e3o mais caracter\u00edsticas sobre o assassino. Isso vai montando um arqu\u00e9tipo dele no menu do jogo, e a cada informa\u00e7\u00e3o que um personagem d\u00e1, o arqu\u00e9tipo vai se atualizando, ficando cada vez mais pr\u00f3ximo da verdadeira apar\u00eancia do assassino.\n\nSim, \u00e9 uma hist\u00f3ria clich\u00ea, mas levando em conta que esse jogo \u00e9 uma homenagem aos filmes de western spaghetti (que s\u00e3o repletos de clich\u00eas), podemos dar um desconto.\n\nCombate:\nWesterado: Double Barreled \u00e9 um jogo que se passa no velho oeste, mas nem por isso tem seu foco no combate. O combate em Westerado \u00e9 bem simples, e como nos jogos de fliperama, voc\u00ea n\u00e3o mira com sua arma, mas sim direciona ela para o seu alvo, apenas com a possibilidade de atirar para as laterais. O jogo tem uma pequena variedade de armas, contando apenas com um rev\u00f3lver, rev\u00f3lveres duplos, um rifle, uma shotgun, e as \"bolas\" (um cabo com bolas nas extremidades, que voc\u00ea usa para prender seu alvo).\n\nGr\u00e1ficos:\nN\u00e3o tem muito o que falar, os gr\u00e1ficos s\u00e3o no estilo 8/16 bits. Isso \u00e9 bom, porque roda at\u00e9 naquele r\u00e1dio de pilha que seu v\u00f4 usa pra ouvir o jogo do Santos (sim, eu sei que o seu v\u00f4 \u00e9 santista. Todo velho \u00e9).\n\nMapa:\nA princ\u00edpio, voc\u00ea pode achar o mapa de Westerado um pouco pequeno, mas ao longo que voc\u00ea explora o mapa, voc\u00ea percebe que ele \u00e9 um pouco grande, al\u00e9m de ter uma enorme varia\u00e7\u00e3o de ambiente. Outra coisa bacana sobre o mapa do jogo, \u00e9 que ele possui um mapa subterr\u00e2neo, que aumenta cada vez que voc\u00ea explora minas, t\u00faneis de ferrovias e etc.. Al\u00e9m de ter a possibilidade de explorar o mapa inteiro a p\u00e9, voc\u00ea tem a possibilidade de pegar seu cavalo em pontos espec\u00edfios e fazer uma esp\u00e9cie de fast-travel para outro local. O cavalo s\u00f3 viaja de um ponto espec\u00edfico para outro, ou seja, n\u00e3o serve para o mapa inteiro.\n\nMultiplayer:\nWesterado tem um modo coop de no m\u00e1ximo 2 jogadores. N\u00e3o vou entrar em detalhes, pois ainda n\u00e3o testei o coop.\n\nConclus\u00e3o:\nSe voc\u00ea \u00e9 um entusiasta de jogos old-school, ou um entusiasta de western (parab\u00e9ns, voc\u00ea ir\u00e1 desvender os easter eggs), voc\u00ea com certeza vai passar horas jogando Westerado. A hist\u00f3ria principal, que \u00e9 a busca do assassino, \u00e9 bastante curta (terminei em 2 horas, isso porque fiquei enrolando no jogo), mas se voc\u00ea quiser concluir todas as quests do jogo, com certeza levar\u00e1 mais de uma semana. Ah, \u00e9 bom avisar que quando voc\u00ea conclui a hist\u00f3ria principal, voc\u00ea n\u00e3o poder\u00e1 mais jogar a partir daquele ponto, mas ainda poder\u00e1 carregar o save anterior \u00e0 conclus\u00e3o do jogo. Ou seja, se voc\u00ea quiser concluir a hist\u00f3ria principal por \u00faltimo, fa\u00e7a todas as quests antes. Ao longo que voc\u00ea vai concluindo algumas quests importantes, voc\u00ea destrava novos personagens jog\u00e1veis (no total de 5, se eu n\u00e3o me engano, o primeiro sendo o protagonista). A trilha sonora do jogo \u00e9 muito bem trabalhada, e realmente lembra as m\u00fasicas de filmes de western spaghetti, sempre seguindo aquele padr\u00e3o de banjo, gaita, guitarra e etc..\n\nBom, eu gostei bastante de Westerado, e se voc\u00ea estiver na d\u00favida se compra ou n\u00e3o, eu te aconselho a agarrar esse jogo com toda vontade que voc\u00ea tem. N\u00e3o encontrei at\u00e9 agora nenhum contra.\n\nWesterado: Double Barreled \u00e9 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1429642604, "timestamp_updated": 1429642604, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15476301": {"recommendationid": "15476301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005183357", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459338892}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game!

Very western thing indeed!\nThe way you search for the villain is pretty much up to you. You can just kill each in every person on your way until you find the bad guy. Or you can go around and ask people if they saw anything. Some will tell you small bits just because they hate the guy, other will ask you for a favour in exchange for this info. Then you\u2019ll know that he was tall, was wearing green bandana, black trousers and red jacket. Main villain looks are actually randomized every time you start a game, so there\u2019s a bit of replayability involved.\nIf you just do the main quest and decide to find and kill the guy - you can make it in ~2h. But most of the cool stuff happens as side-quests, those small favours people ask you about.\nAnd it\u2019s not just some linear stuff about bringing thing from point A to point B, there are actually factions in here. And you have to decide who you want to help - would it be indians, military, oil tycoon or fellow ranchers?\nIn addition to quests, you can grab wanted posters from sheriff and try to find the bad guys to get some bounty. Money can be spent on cloth which is purely visual. And guns which vary the way you need to act in combat.\nSpeaking about combat - it\u2019s pretty simple. You have one button to draw (or sheath) a gun and second button to cock and then shoot that gun. Bullets fly only left or right and you cannot move while shooting. So you\u2019ll have to run around quite a lot to evade enemy bullets and to place yours correctly.\nThe game plays quite well with gamepad, a bit less so with keyboard (at least to my liking). And since the game\u2019s made using Flash, you can play it on pretty much any hardware.\nOverall it\u2019s pretty fun experience for a good price.\n\nDownsides right now:\n- Not too much replayability (all the quests and the world are same on every start, just the villain has different cloth)\n- If you do main quest, it takes just about 2h\n- No key rebinding and a pretty strange default binds (works better with gamepad IMO)\n\nYou can watch a bit more in-depth look at the game here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlkJx2ub6l0\n", "timestamp_created": 1429454230, "timestamp_updated": 1429454230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698091", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15448460": {"recommendationid": "15448460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003048262", "num_games_owned": 848, "num_reviews": 158, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429538461}, "language": "german", "review": "Westerado: Double Barreled ist die Hommage des kleinen niederl\u00e4ndischen Entwicklerteams Ostrich Banditos an die Spaghetti-Western-Filme der 70er Jahre.

Your ranch has been burned down. With nothing but the hat on your head, the shirt on your back, and the revolver in your holster, you set out on a quest for vengeance. \n\n       And then the game basically turns you loose on a sandbox Western action-RPG and lets you do whatever the hell you want.  Sure, you're supposed to find your family's killer and enact your revenge, but let's be honest: there's a lot more to do in Westerado, and you'd be foolish to simply skip through the main storyline and be done. Most people will probably do the same quests first: helping a concerned wife bring her drunk husband home, clearing out a graveyard of bandits, etc. \n\n      The quest design at first seems pretty straightforward, but there's actually a great deal of freedom here. As far as I can tell, literally every single NPC in the game can be killed, which can be a boon during certain quests whose other option for completion is a hefty amount of money. In one notable mid-game quest, a local Indian chief tasks you with freeing buffalo from ranches. I did so with a blend of violence and not-giving-a-damn and wound up finishing with the blood of a few ranchers on my hands but the satisfaction of herds of bison now roaming free. \n            Upon attempting to finish another quest, however, I learned that this quest was now failed because the woman who gave it to me was angry at me for killing one of the ranchers. It's this inter-connectivity that makes the quests interesting, and as the game goes on the quests get bigger and more important.\n\n      In my favorite questline, you're tasked with trying to bring peace between said Indian chief's tribe and a local militia. I don't know how much else I could've done, but let's just say it didn't go well. In my story, [spoiler]I ended up heling the tribe wipe out the fort and take it over. I was then given the option to continue this questline and help them take over the nearby city, a task I attempted but then failed at. Upon reloading, I reckoned I wasn't sure I wanted to kill every shopkeeper and innocent civilian, so I moved on and hoped the Indian tribe would stay in the fort and not murder everyone. To be fair, it WAS the militia chief's fault for pulling a gun during peace talks, but still.[/spoiler]\n     \n         The main questline is unique in one feature, however: for most of the bigger quests, completing them gives you a detail about the murderer. As far as I can tell, the murderer's identity is randomized fully, so it's not the same game for anyone. In mine, I learned that he had a medium-brimmed hat, then learned it was a ten gallon, then that he wore blue, etc. until I had a reasonable picture of him. It's a satisfying way of tying sidequests to main storyline, but it's important to note that you can confront ALMOST ANYONE in the game through dialogue. I think if you got lucky you could confront the murderer right away if you happened to find him. \n      \n         With all this talk of systems and RPG mechanics, I want to make one thing clear: this package wouldn't work if the core gameplay wasn't top notch. Fortunately for everyone, it is. To fire a shot you have to unholster your gun with a button, then press a button to prime it and the same button again to fire. This methodical, three-step process every time you want to shoot something feels good, and it can lead to stressful moments in firefights with more than one enemy. Reloading is a similar process of hitting the reload button once per bullet, so to fully reload you have to mash R like a madman to put your six shots back in your revolver. \n\n      That said, is the combat itself any good? The answer is yes. Westerado's health system boils down to you having up to three hats: each hat is an extra life point. Get shot with no hat, and you die and are returned to a respawn point, half your money gone. The upside of this is that each enemy is the same; shoot an enemy and his hat flies off. At this point, sometimes he'll surrender, but other times he'll keep on firing. Shoot him again to put him in the ground. \n\nOccasionally, one shot will kill an enemy who's wearing a hat, but I couldn't figure out consistency on this: whether it was where I aimed, some sort of critical hit system, or what. Sometimes the hats from dead enemies fall on the ground, and you can quickly pick them up to restore hat-health (to your maximum of three). It's a fun and lethal system that feels close to the likes of Hotline Miami or other fast-paced, everyone-has-low-health games. \n\nThough you start off with only one revolver, eventually you can buy other guns, including a shotgun, dual revolvers, or a rifle. I only purchased the rifle, and it was a great upgrade; though slower-firing, it could pierce through enemies and offered a wider view of areas.\n\n       I'm running rapidly out of room, but I'll spare a few sentences for aesthetic and aural notes. The artstyle of the game is a beautiful mix of spritework that doesn't adhere specifically to any sort of artificial old-school hardware limitation; because of this, color abounds and there's a lot of variety. The characters all sport a lo-fi charm, and the animals are both cute and occasionally deadly. \n     Bodies remain where they've fallen, so it can be fun to walk through a location you've cleared of enemies and look upon their fallen remains as vultures fly in to scavenge their corpses. It sounds morbid, but the cheerful cartoon artstyle doesn't make you feel bad for your enemies as their bones are picked clean.\n\n      On the sound front, the music in this game is sublime. Harmonicas carry the main weight here, evoking a Western feel that makes you want to strap on some spurs and spit into a jar. (Editor's Note: Cade does not support spitoon usage and urges people to find other pastimes less harmful) The music changes crazily when it's fighting time, pumping you up to pump lead. \n      Once the last enemy is killed, a triumphant trill lets you know you've lived one more battle. It's well-done and exciting each time.\n\n    Westerado is a fantastic game that blends action and player choice, and I've tried to keep spoilers to a minimum. At one point, I wandered off the map through a tiny, not-really-visible path, and found a crazy area that made me at once intrigued and amused. \n\n     The writing in the game, while sparse, is charming and interesting, and keeps you wanting to solve mysteries, get in gunfights, and help out townsfolk. While the normal price and even the sale price is a bit steep, there's nothing like Westerado out there and there appears to be considerable replay value (the randomized murderer, extra player characters with their own motivations, hidden boss fights, etc.). \n\n      Though the lo-fi aesthetic may initially appear to be just one of many, the unique touches and captivating gameplay elevates Westerado above the rest in the indie scene. Though the game's length is short (I finished the main story with the first character in roughly two hours), it's well-paced and I didn't do anywhere near everything. \n\nHighly recommended, though perhaps waiting for a sale is the best option; for non-completionists and speedier gamers, you may come away disappointed at the relatively short length.", "timestamp_created": 1429328886, "timestamp_updated": 1477000518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 291, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.926795", "comment_count": "16", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15424071": {"recommendationid": "15424071", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071646337", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442572790}, "language": "english", "review": "i shot my uncle and he became a ghost\n\n\nspooky/10", "timestamp_created": 1429324873, "timestamp_updated": 1429324873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 41, "weighted_vote_score": "0.423009", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15424059": {"recommendationid": "15424059", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999135700", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461377517}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

I normally don't review games, but I feel like this one deserves it.\nThe story may start out as the over-used revenge story, but by the time you finish it feels completely fresh. The tutorial introduces the plot right away (a mysterious bandit burns down your ranch), and the rest of the game is dedicated to your personal vendetta. The mechanic here is interesting, because every playthrough the outfit of said bandit changes, and you are tasked with asking around to learn what he looks like. This is achieved through a multitude of ways, from rumors, to quests, to even blaming everyone until you find him. Seriously, this game takes free-roam to the next level. Even in conversations, you're not only given dialogue different options, you can pull out your gun, cock it, then fire it if you want. You can also just walk away. These are legitamate options, and the characters will respond appropriately, some will just hand you money when you threaten them or get annoyed if you walk away. Personally, I find this incredibly satisfying.\nThis open endedness extends to everything too. To earn money you can do jobs for people, mug strangers, or even rob the bank. And you don't need a quest or specific button to rob the bank, you just go in, shoot everyone, grab the money, run, and pray to god that the sheriff doesn't find you. The map is pretty massive for such a short story, and there's a ton to do. Every quest has several different ways to go about it, and quite a few of the quests will depend on you not doing another one. For example, you can help free the buffalo for the Indian Camp, but if you do that, you can't help the army fight them.\nCustomization is there, if you're wondering. They have different outfits and hats to buy or pick up all over the map. There's no RPGish skills or anything, but it's not needed. The game depends on the player skill.\nThe music and sound are not only authentic, but match the mood and fit the game perfectly. I would say the same about the art style. It's simple and pixelated, but get's the job done well. Even though the characters are basic and abstract, some of the backgrounds are detailed and gorgeous. The art and sound design fit Westerado well.\nNow you might be asking if there's anything wrong with this game. I have only one small complaint, so [b] if you need to read any part of this review, here it is. [/b]The combat is weak. It's a 2D shooter, and while it fits the game well, it can be a bit clunky and difficult to aim. The depth is unfortunately hard to judge, and several times I found myself shooting right behind enemies. And in a game like this, a few misses will cost you. It's such a small issue though, and the rest of the combat system is quick and satisfying. Also, here's a ton of different guns which brings variety to the mid-game, and improves the combat system.\nReplayability is also high, with 4 different characters and tons of different options each playthrough.\n\nTL;DR: Buy this game, especially while it's on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1429227032, "timestamp_updated": 1429227439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601337", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15407475": {"recommendationid": "15407475", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996501124", "num_games_owned": 6343, "num_reviews": 126, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429482377}, "language": "english", "review": "Westerado: Double Barreled started life as a standout Flash game on Adult Swim\u2019s website.

The graphics are similar to 8-bit style, yet look great when playing. The lighting and mood change as you transition between sections, and as you move between dark and light areas. There are multiple different NPCs which all have varying appearances to keep from repeating too much. There are also plenty of animals and aggressive enemies in this game that you must keep an eye out for, so don't just go running through the desert expecting it to be uneventful!\n\nThe premise of the game is to find your family's murderer, which involves getting clues about how the murderer looks, which help finalize an overall picture of who you're looking for. Your job is to then search the impressively large map to find this man/woman, which can seem daunting considering how far you have to travel. There is the ability to ride a horse between cities though to cut down on time. \n\nIn orer to do this take, you must perform jobs, many of which involve escorting wagons, buffalo, etc. from one place to another while a group of bandits try to steal/kill your cargo. These minigames are actually very challenging, and I died many times attempting, as you can see in the video! The shooting mechanics in this game require you to cock and fire your gun, including reloading bullet by bullet, which make maneuvering and fighting that much more difficult. I'd recommend constantly strafing up and down the screen to avoid getting shot and to help you line up yours better.\n\nAttaining money can be a challenge aside from finding bags on the floor. Most missions involve having to defend something, while others require you to simply pull your gun out. Either way, buying things required for missions takes away from being able to purchase new guns and clothing, so I typically stayed away from those missions. There are plenty of side missions to choose from though, so you will have plenty to do in this game.\n\nOverall, this game is tons of fun, and well worth the money. It's meant to be replayable, and I can see myself replaying this game multiple times, each with a new murderer to search for.

If you've played Red Dead Redemption it's along the lines of that, except more pixelated. Like in Red Dead Redemption, the game offers an open world where you can interact with the people and the enviroments as you chose. You can explore the world and take on quests in any order you chose. You can even rob a bank, murder the towns folk, and accuse any one of heinous acts... or you might not. . It's totally up to you!\n\nAt the start of the game, you'll find your family murdered and your ranch burned down. The goal is to figure out who did it, and get your revenge. Here's the interesting twist, the bandit that wronged you could be any one, any NPC in the game. You'll be tasked with doing various missions to find clues to the masked bandit. As you find more clues that describes different features, such as fat or skinny, color of his/her cloths, the type of hat s/he's wearing, you'll be able to accuse people of murder. You may accuse who ever you like and when ever, but if you're not sure, and you're wrong, the situation could turn south very quickly. Caution when accusing is suggested. You'll also be able to find more clues and hints through conversations with the townsfolk and though it does feature the usual \"dialog choice A or B\" design there is an additional option to draw your weapon in the middle of any conversation. Doing so could affect the out come. Besides talking to the locals and hunting down bandits, there are other mini games such as poker to help distract the player. The game has a vast open world for the player to discover, and offers a lot of content and things to do while adventuring. \n\nAesthetically I think the game looks wonderful. The game's pixel art does a great job detailing the game's environment. The color pallet is suiting and easy on the eyes, and there's a high degree of artistry being displayed here. The audio is equally worth praising, as it's full of memorable spaghetti western themes.\n\nThe only part of Westerdo I would critique is how the game handles identifying the killer. The whole goal of the game is to identify a very specific person with very specific visual traits. Since the game is done in all pixel art, it could potentially make the task more difficult than it needs to be. There are tons of NPCs in the game, all looking quite different, but not THAT different, and telling the difference NPC A's slighly taller hat than NPC B's could prove more challenging than need be. But to be fair, I haven't had that issue my self, but I can see it as a potential issue for some one else.\n\nOver all Westardo is a wonderfully designed pixel open world western game, with a lot to like about it. The game is open not only in the world that you explore, but also in how the player explores it. Be a bandit, be a hero, it totally up to you. Either way, Westerdo is an easy recommendation.\n\nPros:\n- Well designed open world gameplay\n- Very open to a variety of play styles (Be a bandit! be a hero!)\n- Great aesthetics and music\n- Encourages replay\n\nCons:\n- Pixel style could make identifying the killer harder than needed\n- Lacks extra features and options", "timestamp_created": 1429213374, "timestamp_updated": 1429213374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484423", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15404541": {"recommendationid": "15404541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166072521", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515095323}, "language": "english", "review": "It looks, sounds and feels very fresh.

You will meet Indians, ranchers, bandits, ghosts and many other characters who all have great lines to say in true western fashion. Constantly finding clues to discover the identity of the murderer makes the hunt more and more engaging, and when you finally confront him there is a really well executed plot twist after an action-packed climax.\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS[/h1]\nThe 16-bit world is full of little details, from the shadows, to the houses and the civilians. Sometimes I just found myself staring at the screen for a minute or two looking at how perfectly the developers captured the cinematic look of the Far West.\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nThere are so many things to say here.\nFirst of all, the combat. You can carry three weapons max, and the arsenal includes: a revolver, dual revolvers, a shotgun, a rifle, a tomahawk and bolas. In order to shoot, you must draw the gun, cock it and then pull the trigger. This can also be done during dialogues in order to scare or get informations from someone. You have a total of three hats, which serve as your life: you die when you are shot without a hat. In order to get hats, you can buy them in stores or shoot one off a person.\nThe game map is relatively big and you can fast travel by using a horse that you find in certain areas. There are a lot of missions to do, which include escorting buffaloes, killing bandits in a certain area, finding an object and so on. You must complete them to acquire more and more information on the Murderer.\nThere are also some side activities, like visiting a saloon to drink, buying different outfits, bounty hunting, visiting banks to deposit money or playing cards.\nYou can also play the campaign with a friend at your side. Unfortunately, they can do little to nothing other than helping you in gun battles.\n\n[h1]CHALLENGE[/h1]\nThe game is not particularly challenging when playing as the Hero, since you will always have an hat or two. In case you die, you will spawn back to your Uncle's house and you will lose half of the money you had, which can be acquired really easily. \n\n[h1]SOUND[/h1]\nThe soundtrack to this game is beautiful, and perfectly fits the atmosphere of the game and of the different areas that you explore. The sound effects are also well executed, especially the ones related to the weapons.\n\n[h1]REPLAYABILITY[/h1]\nAfter completing the story, you can use the save file to finish all the other quests, or start a new game by playing as three different characters, each with different skills. Each playthrough there is a different Murderer, so every time you play is different from the other. And for the completionists out there, there are 79 achievements to unlock.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic western game, with great graphics and soundtrack, responsive controls, engaging combat and a lot of content. You can't miss this, especially at the honest price of 15$.\n\n[h1]Story: 8\nGraphics: 9\nGameplay: 9\nChallenge: 7\nSound: 9\nReplayability: 9\n\n[b]ENJOYMENT: 9.5\nFRUSTRATION: 5[/b][/h1]\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_VuBkttXIrpbrxwfYL_B-w]Subscribe to my channel[/url]\n[url=http://www.facebook.com/EnjoyTheGaming]Like on Facebook[/url]\n[url=http://nickygra.wix.com/enjoythegaming]Check my official website[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EnjoyTheGaming]Join my Steam group[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1429209742, "timestamp_updated": 1429209742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.413706", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15403790": {"recommendationid": "15403790", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975593715", "num_games_owned": 1310, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429111399}, "language": "english", "review": "***Disclaimer: Copy provided by the developer/publisher***\n\nI don't particularly go out of my way to watch Westerns, but for some reason, whenever I happen to consume a piece of media set in the romanticized Old West, I genuinely like the experience. That's why I naturally gravitated towards Westerado, because from the looks of it - and having briefly played the original Flash version on the Adult Swim website - it seemed like it checks all the points of the grand list of Western clich\u00e9s. And that's an entirely good thing.\n\nAs is typical for a Western, our quest is motivated by revenge. At the start of the game, our family gets murdered by an unknown bandit while we were off catching a runaway buffalo. So it's up to us to avenge our family and punish as many bandits as time permits. On our quest, we spend some time walking around a bunch of towns and getting to know a variety of colorful characters. But the vast majority is spent traversing the prairies or exploring some mines. All of this is very reminiscent of the original The Legend of Zelda, since each area is an enclosed space and the world is divided into a grid. Similarly, some of the challenges we face can't immediately be surmounted and usually the MacGuffin we need is placed at the other end of the map. Thankfully we're accompanied by our trusty horse that enables us to fast-travel to certain locations.\n\nIn order to uncover the identity of our fugitive bandit, we'll need to gather some information. Westerado knows full well that a good Western is always playing double duty as both an action movie and a detective story. So we're tasked to fulfill a variety of side-quests in order to receive information on the looks and whereabouts of our nemesis. However, the way we go about our business is largely up to us. We can play the loner with a heart of gold, or we can become an outlaw ourselves, either helping every soul we encounter or leaving behind a trail of blood respectively. \n\nBut we're not here to just talk and walk around the desert, we wanna shoot some dudes. Luckily Westerado has us covered. The world is filled with baddies acting as target practice, though the game's challenge isn't too taxing. Part of the reason is the fact that both our enemies and our protagonist can only shoot horizontally, meaning you have to be on the same plane as your enemies in order to shoot them or for them to hit you. More skilled players can also attempt to shoot off enemies' hats. What sounds like a token homage to every Western ever actually has a pretty good reason for being there. Hats represent your health in this world and you've got three hats as your life bar. Meaning you can take three bullets before the fourth one sends you to your grave. Coupled with the shooting mechanic, in which you first have to draw your weapon, cock the hammer prior to every shot and then finally shoot your enemies, as well as reload every bullet manually one after the other, it turns an otherwise unchoreographed mess of revolvers into an intricate ballet of preparing your gun, lining up the sights and hitting your enemies between the eyes all the while avoiding the crossfire from bandits that tend to surround you. \n\nAfter you've righted all the wrongs and put an end to the reign of terror of our nemesis, you can unlock multiple other characters to go through the adventure a second time, albeit with a different loadout to make things more challenging. Which is definitely needed, especially considering that it took me just around 2.5 hours to beat the campaign the first time around.\n\nOn the aesthetic front I have to say that I greatly enjoyed the visual style they employed. Sure, it's another indie game with an 8-bit aesthetic, but it excels when it comes to color palette and subtle animations. Coupled with the gorgeous soundtrack that hits all the right notes in every situation, it creates a genuinely nostalgic atmosphere. Fans of Westerns are advised to pick up the game as it's a nice little offering that's not quite an adventure in the league of something like Red Dead Redemption, but still manages to capture that feeling of being a cowboy in the Old West.", "timestamp_created": 1429207314, "timestamp_updated": 1429207314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647669", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15403568": {"recommendationid": "15403568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039909911", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473159986}, "language": "english", "review": "Gun'blazin and western madness and sheriffs that are too scared to do em'jobs this game is fantastic!", "timestamp_created": 1429206405, "timestamp_updated": 1429206405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.329980", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15403333": {"recommendationid": "15403333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063781373", "num_games_owned": 613, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429289178}, "language": "english", "review": "Westerado would make John Wayne and Clint Eastwood proud.

Seldom do I feel I can so freely recommend a game without reservation.\n\nMy Quick Look on Westerado: Double Barreled (spoiler, I take the outlaw route)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItZp400oB9M\n\nThis game is REALLY good.  It starts with the usual western plot device that sets up the story, but what Westerado does great (that I was actually surprised at) was how important all of the NPCs were to the story.  You start off with a clue as to who killed your brother and mother.  But it's not much of a clue at all, because it basically only solves 50% of the population (maybe).  \n\nBut the interesting thing is that dialogue trees are not limited to just different dialogue options.  You can have actions be your dialogue options.  The actions are pretty limited, you could either walk away from a conversation, to which the NPC you were talking with might get upset or find it strange but it could also be a tactic.  The other dialogue action you can take it pointing your gun towards the person you're having a conversation with.  This gets them nervous as they try to cool the situation.  You can FURTHER push this action by cocking the hammer of your gun back which puts additional pressure on the NPC to act.  Sometimes they'll just drop whatever money they have and run.  Others will make a funny comment that manages to reflect the situation.  Super refreshing, well designed and it's this very element that I believe will make people want to play multiple playthroughs.\n\nIf you have a quest that informs you to visit the owner of a tavern and you shoot that owner, that quest is no longer available as well as closing the tavern down. It can be tremendously fun to just threaten and accuse everyone you speak with but it can also be fun to play as a detective.\n\nThere is an excellent map system/quest log/hint log that keeps you updated with where you left off and is executed perfectly.  I never found myself wanting for information in any particular way and the presentation is just fantastic.\n\nSpeaking of presentation, while some of the character pixel-art is bordering on Atari 2600, the environmental artwork is [B]truly[/B] something to behold.  I realize that it may not be everyone's cup-of-tea, but damn do I enjoy it.  \n\nNormally, I don't comment on music, but holy shit these guys nailed it.  Not only is it authentic, it's scripted magnificently.  At each and every turn that there could have been a musical embellishment to heighten what was happening on screen, it was there. The quick strum of an acoustic guitar when something dramatic is on the screen but still managing to flow with the rest of the soundtrack remains to be a distinct bulletpoint for me. The score is masterfully done.\n \nAll-in-all, I never knew that I really wanted a 2D sandbox spaghetti western.  Considering that you have full agency to control the narrative of the game, your playstyle actually matters and dictates how the story will unfold.  Will you simply carry-out what your quest log tells you?  Or will you be an outlaw?  A vigilante?  \n\nWesterado is crazy good.  Normally I am a bit reserved when recommending games, but I am very confident that pretty much everyone would have a blast with this game.\n\n[B]Very much recommended.[/B]", "timestamp_created": 1429203783, "timestamp_updated": 1429203829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441919", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 1019, "total_negative": 99, "total_reviews": 1118}}

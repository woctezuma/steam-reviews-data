hell smup. While, if your a fan of the genre, you're probably not going to encounter many [i]completely original[/i] mechanics, what you will find is a large range of ways to approach a familiar formula. Unlike many bullet hell games, where defensive play is essential, in this the majority of bullets are produced by low health minions, and since bullets are transformed into points on death, aggressive strategies are shockingly valid. The game also allows you to customize your bullet patterns (although most need to be unlocked) and switch between three of them on the fly (either with a direct bind and/or with cycling if your prefer). While most are fairly simple, some are complex and can be affected by the direction of your movement, your location when you switched to them or the use of slow move (the essential bullet hell feature reduces your speed and displays your hit dot for precise dodging).\n\nThe only complaint I have is that some of the menus are less intuitive than I'd like them to be. For example if you don't have enough points to buy a bullet pattern, you're not able to see a display of it. There also isn't a fully functional stage select function; you can either play arcade mode which allows you to set all your options but always starts you from stage 1, or conquest mode which allows you to select previously beaten stages but saves your lives and doesn't let your alter your bullet patterns without creating a new file (starting from stage 1).\n\nIf you're new to the bullet hell genre and interested in trying it out, this game is probably a fantastic starting point. Easy is challenging enough to be satisfying and since conquest mode allows you to save progress between stages, the game is relatively forgiving. If you're an experienced smup player, this game is certainly worth having in your library. If you're only a casual smup player, this probably isn't a must own unless you're a fan of the cute/derpy aesthetic. The screenshots and video paint a rather accurate picture of the game, so it should be rather obvious if this is something that might appeal to you.", "timestamp_created": 1505552086,

Su Hyper carta es Boost, cuesta 20 estrellas, necesita nivel 3 y genera en tu mano 2 puddings aleatorios, por lo que si lo usas con ya 2 puddings en tu mano y atacas a alguien, tendr\u00e1s 4 pudding en la mano hasta que al final del turno tengas que descartar uno.\n\nLa cuesti\u00f3n es robar r\u00e1pido puddings para ganar estad\u00edsticas.

I actually don't remember since I buy so many bundles. I'm pretty sure I had it wishlisted because it is a bullet hell, but the overly \"Kawaii\" characters and lengthy dialogue sessions (why so much talking in a freaking bullet hell game?) are grating and more childish than cute. I had to turn the skip dialogue option on. Also, playing this fullscreen will decrease your monitors resolution (only during game), so the game looks slightly pixelated full screen (perhaps less of a problem in Windowed mode)\n\n[h1]Theme aside, QP Shooting is a very solid vertical bullet hell, that will only appeal the players who will try most decent bullet hell games (like me) and \"weaboos\" obsessed with overly cutesy anime bulls***. Even though I haven't surpassed level 2 yet (seems I'm getting rusty at shmups), I never felt that the difficulty was unfair. You can choose different formations for your weapon shots, and styles that affect your hyper mode. The bullet patterns seem less crazy than some Cave or Touhou shmups, so this might be a good starting point for some players (but I personally recommend Danmaku Unlimited 2, Crimzon Clover, or Jamestown on Steam, or DoDonPachi and ESP Ra.de on a MAME emulator).

sobre QP Shooting - Dangerous!! solo puedo decir que fall\u00e9... trat\u00e9 de salvar el Pudding, pero fall\u00e9. Soy muy malo para este juego ;_;\n\nSobre el personaje para 100% Orange Juice:\nQP (Dangerous)\nHP: 5\nStats: 0/0/-1\nEspecial: Gana bonus stats por cada carta con \"Pudding\" en su nombre que tenga en su mano. +1 ATK por cada Dangerous Pudding, +1 DEF por cada Bad Pudding, +1 EVD por cada Pudding.\nHyper: Sweet Guardian. (Boost) Nivel 3, Costo 20 Stars. Roba 2 cartas con \"Pudding\" en su nombre del deck central.\n\nEs el \u00fanico de los personajes bonus (hasta ahora) cuyas estad\u00edsticas base no son id\u00e9nticas a la del personaje original, en este caso la diferencia entre la QP original y \u00e9sta es la EVD. QPD es un personaje interesante porque, con los astros alineados y buena estrategia, puede pasar de ser una super agresiva con hasta +3 de ATK durante gran parte de la partida, a ser una super tanque con hasta +3 de DEF para proteger las stars al final del juego. El problema es que necesita tener las cartas de Pudding en su mano, y adem\u00e1s de la sola dificultad de eso, est\u00e1 el hecho de que esto limita en gran medida su juego. \nSu hyper ayuda a acelerar el proceso de obtenci\u00f3n de Pudding, pero su costo a veces puede resultar contraproducente para subir de norma, lo mejor es guardarlo para cuando est\u00e9s cerca de un oponente con el que quieras luchar, o cuando tengas detr\u00e1s de ti a un perseguidor, o usarlo con Mimic y conseguir un mejor hyper. \nFinalmente, la carta Pudding (la regular) no es tan beneficiosa como las otras dos, as\u00ed que si tienes que priorizar que cartas conservar en tu mano, Pudding es la de menor prioridad. Si todav\u00eda no est\u00e1s en nivel 4, des\u00e9chala. Si est\u00e1s en nivel 4, no dudes en usarla si tu HP est\u00e1 bajo. Pero realmente recomiendo no meterla a tu deck de 10 cartas, puesto que termina estorbando al momento de usar la carta Hyper, y si enfrentas tanques como Fernet o Kyoko, probablemente el deck central ya tenga la carta Pudding regular al menos una vez.\n\nSu bgm me agrada, pero no es de mis favoritas.", "timestamp_created": 1482251623, "timestamp_updated": 1482261194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632921", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28348186": {"recommendationid": "28348186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096017360", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481656529}, "language": "english", "review": "The hardest part about this game are the visual distractions.

muy aficionado a los bullet hell porque siempre me matan y me hacen llorar. El \u00faltimo que jugu\u00e9 con algo de perseverancia fue el de Ikaruga. Y despu\u00e9s de unos d\u00edas, suspir\u00e9 profundo, recog\u00ed mi ap\u00e9ndice y acarici\u00e9 mi h\u00edgado, y me dije: \"ya basta\". Pero hay algo de maravilloso e inevitable en ese tipo de juegos que a veces no puedes abandonarlos. Tanto pinche pixel en la batalla y como se juntan, cual si fueran chacales de la misma banda tepite\u00f1a, y todos se avientan a meterte una madriza y el chiste del juego es que t\u00fa los venzas a todos, y seas el rey. \n\n* QP Shooting Dangerous!! es el segundo juego de una serie, seg\u00fan le\u00ed por ah\u00ed y tambi\u00e9n le\u00ed que sigue las andanzas absurdas del primero. No hay mucha historia, pero el juego es divertido y absurdo. Tu juegas el papel de una muchacha - conejo (estoy tentado a llamarla QP), que debe vencer a otras muchachas o estudiantes, arquet\u00edpicas estilo anime / manga. Los personajes son entretenidos y los escenarios tienen su chiste, pero no me parecen memorables o destacables dentro del g\u00e9nero. El objetivo: saber qui\u00e9n diablos se rob\u00f3 el bud\u00edn. Postre que creo que es muy popular en las escuelas japonesas; todo el juego, de una manera extra\u00f1a, me recuerda un fabuloso episodio de \"My boss, my hero\", uno de los mejores doramas que he visto en toda mi vida. \n\n* \u00bfQu\u00e9 distingue a este juego de otros bullet hells? Las formaciones. El personaje principal obtiene peque\u00f1os conejitos que funcionan como disparadores secundarios y puedes cambiarlos de formaci\u00f3n para ajustarlos mejor a tu tipo de juego. Claro, si juegas esto varias veces, obtienes puntos para comprar m\u00e1s formaciones. Algunas son bien mafufas, y con eso me refiero a que son para jugadores demasiado avanzados o clavados (estas formaciones suelen dar m\u00e1s puntos por enemigo muerto y est\u00e1n pensadas para vencer mejores puntuaciones), pero hay otras que son entretenidas y verdaderamente \u00fatiles. \n\n* Otro rasgo distintivo es el modo Conquest (conquista), dise\u00f1ado especialmente para viejillos refunfu\u00f1ones como yo. En este modo puedes guardar el juego despu\u00e9s de pasar un nivel y con ello aseguras obtener la mejor puntuaci\u00f3n posible, con el mayor n\u00famero de vidas ahorradas, y as\u00ed perfecciones tu juego de escenario en escenario. Esto es bastante chido para gente que no puede sentarse durante horas y que tampoco est\u00e9 dispuesta a llorar sangre. Es decir: para todos los que no somos japoneses obsesivos. \n\n* \u00bfRecomiendo QP Shooting Dangerous!!!? Sim\u00f3n. A pesar de que tiene facilidades para el gamer casual, tambi\u00e9n tiene retos y posibilidades de juego para los m\u00e1s exigentes. Lo malo es que los scoreboards de steam est\u00e1n hackeados hasta el infinito, pero bien puedes jugarlo con un amigo o retar a tu cuate, y eso brindar\u00e1 diversi\u00f3n suficiente. Juego de shots: un caballito de tequila o de whiskey cada vez que alguien diga \"pudding\". \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHSBUh4gelc&list=PLf3hSHJ6VZaN0uoJEzz3wSZZlFd-b6d6Q", "timestamp_created": 1474031132, "timestamp_updated": 1474031132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25484781": {"recommendationid": "25484781", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962212082", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489793107}, "language": "english", "review": "Pudding!!!", "timestamp_created": 1473714083, "timestamp_updated": 1473714083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489734", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25425041": {"recommendationid": "25425041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306914901", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511809764}, "language": "schinese", "review": "CUTE INTERESTING NICE!

I've played many danmaku shooters - Touhou 2~14 (several of which I've 1cc'd on Hard Difficulty), Bullet Heaven 2, Suguri, and Murasaki, to name a few - and in every one of those games, it was very clear what on-screen was safe to collect and what enemies and bullets you need to avoid. In QP Shooting, however, everything on screen looks like it just blends in with itself (due to the lack of high-contrast borders on everything), making it extremely difficult to discern what's safe and what isn't.\n\nQP Shooting's difficulty comes mostly from visual-effects distraction and pointless screen clutter rather than actual curtain-fire bullet patterns; many times, it's very difficult to determine what is a bullet and what's a harmless visual special effect on-screen because the special effects get way too cluttered when combined with the flurry of things you're trying to avoid. When you kill an enemy, it (and the bullets it shot) all turn to semi-transparent stars that quickly home in on your character; said stars are the same size and color as the very bullets you need to avoid. The rotating flashy greenish circle that's constantly around QP only serves to let brigher-colored bullets (especially the green ones) blend right in, making them more difficult to see. When anything on-screen is destroyed, it goes up in a poof, obscuring vision in that area briefly and making it hard to anticipate anything going through it, especially if you're getting swarmed at a closer range. \n\nThis game feels like the equivalent of playing a driving game where you have to avoid obstacles, and several holograms of said obstacles clutter the path around what you actually have to avoid.\n\nIf you don't care for the bullet hell gameplay and just want it for the silly story and cute protagonist, or you just want the 100% Orange Juice DLC that comes with it, then I'd say this game is just right for you.

Pudding the food, not an actual character. It seems all of it has disappeared and only QP remembers its existence and it's up to her to get to bottom of why her favorite food suddenly vanished. As you might have gathered by now the plot for this game is absurd and all the situations you will be in are equally as odd. Throughout your journey you will be fighting street lights, trees, trains and anything else the devs happened to see while gazing out of their window. There are 5 stages in total and it should last under an hour to beat them all if you are skilled enough to beat them on your first try. A neat little feature is that even if you lose it will let you save a replay of your playthrough to see what you did wrong or to simply show off.\n\nStarting off the game you will have the choice of picking one of four difficulty modes. It is a pretty \u201ceasy\u201d game compared to most others of the genre so my suggestion would be to start on a higher difficulty for those accustomed to these type of games. You will then have the choice of choosing one of the three fighting styles this game offers. Aggressive which causes your hyper attack to do plenty of damage but lasts a short while, Defensive is the opposite and allows you to use your hyper attack for far longer but causes little damage and Orthodox which is a mix of the two. There is even more customization, you will then be able to choose three projectile formations for your playthrough, but starting off you only have three anyways so it doesn't feel as overwhelming as it sounds.  With that out of the way, onto the actual game.\n\nFirst thing you will notice is how cutesy the art style is with everything having a colorful, light hearted vibe. Regardless of the theme, the game can be quite brutal on higher difficulties and with the game not having any continues you do not have much room for mistakes. In addition to just shooting, you will be able to slow QP down to easier avoid tightly spaced projectiles and the ability to change your bullet formations. Bullet formations play a crucial role in QP Shooting as enemies will attack you from the back, as well as the sides which means that if you only have front firing formations you will be unable to defend yourself and have to avoid their projectiles and hope they leave the screen before they manage to shoot you down. It offers the game a on your feet, tactical feel to it and with 28 formations to unlock there is a ton of ways to play the game and experiment. You buy more formations from the main menu using Rbit points, currency received from play.\n\nTo further aid you, you have the aforementioned Hyper Attack that fills up by causing damage to enemies and are able to overcharge it up to 150% for a longer use. You can't see how far it has filled before reaching 100% charge to know how long until you can use it annoyingly enough. When it is filled you will have a giant circles with its percentage spinning around your character and that can be distracting until you get used to it. Once the hyper attack is activated, the projectiles near you will disintegrate, though this is effect will not take place again and you will still be able to get hit. The main purpose of the hyper attack is to output more damage than normal, as your projectiles grow in size and fill up most of the screen for the duration of your hyper attack. If you get hit during a hyper attack its effects will immediately end but you will not lose a life. It's a pretty useful feature and if used properly can save you from two fatal blows. The damage output is not really a huge difference from your normal projectiles, even on \u201cAggressive\u201d, so you may end up using that skill as a defensive measure more likely than not.\n\nEnemies are pretty varied and you will pretty much never see the same enemy in another stage as they all have a certain theme to it. Some enemies are pretty weird and you will have no idea where from its body it will shoot the projectiles so it's best to keep your distance until you know how it attacks, that is a flaw though a pretty minor one. Though it may be in your best interest to let the enemy fire first, as when you kill an enemy all of its projectiles will disappear and turn into points. It offers a risk and reward type of mechanic though with the lack of online leaderboards it is very hard to care about points or high scores unless you more than one person plays this game on your PC. One other problem I would like to mention is that QP Shooting does not support the D Pad on your controller so you are stuck using the analog stick which is a pain. Moving back to the enemies each level has a unique screen filling mid-boss that will try to destroy you. These are rather fun to fight and break up the pace from fighting regular enemies all throughout and really helps to avoid it feeling repetitive.\n\nFighting actual bosses is where the real fun begins and where all of the dialogue happens. Before each fight QP and the boss of that stage will talk about pudding and make various jokes, it can be funny the first time around but they do go a bit overboard with the amount of text, making you unlikely to want to read all of it again on other playthroughs. Thankfully the option to turn off all dialogue is available. Bosses can take quite a beating and throw much more intricate projectile patterns at you so that is where you are likely to die a few times. When you whittle down their health bars they will change their fighting styles and go back to max health. All those are typical bullet hell features but what is a bit different is that each boss has a familiar like a baby chick, a roulette wheel or a toy lion. These will also shoot projectiles at you and don't stay dead for long. Bosses all have over three forms so they are pretty lengthy fights and finishing off their health bar with a special attack nets some big points. They get progressively harder and harder, by the fourth stage you will need some decent skills or formations to make it through.\n\nThere is a multiplier for killing enemies and will deplete if you spend too long without destroying anything. It is in your best interest to gather up points as you will be rewarded with more lives and extra Rbits that will increase your firepower. The music you'll be hearing is very hit or miss, as the soundtrack starts off pretty mediocre but gets progressively better and better the further you get into the game. No voice acting is in this game and it's all text based. Graphics do their job, though this being a vertical bullet hell, it would have been nice to be able to rotate the screen for those of us that can pivot our monitors. As it is we are stuck looking at a vertical game with most of the screen unused. Not game breaking but it is a significant annoyance. There is an option to darken the background to make enemies and projectiles far easier to differentiate and it's a nice feature for those easily distracted by the bright colorful backgrounds.  Everything runs smoothly and I've noticed no slowdowns except for when the stages start.\n\nQP Shooting Dangerous is a really good title for people wanting to bridge the gap between the Shmup and Bullet Hell genre. It is far slower paced than most Bullet Hells and with all the customization available it will prepare you for any type of gameplay other games may have. In addition there is a \u201cConquest\u201d mode that allows you to save after each stage. Even if you load the game you will have the same amount of lives you had the first time you played that stage so you can't simply breeze through the game without learning how to play. If you can't beat a certain stage, it may be best to start over and choose different formations that may be of better use for that situation.

I thought Jamestown was an excellent game and did this genre right. This game not so much. This has the good cutesy vibe and the dialogue is funny, but its the gameplay and design that's the problem. First off, your body is this long girls, but there's only this one small point that is the hitbox. The game says it's the center, but its hard to tell during the moment and you constantly die because you thought you cleared the shot but the hitbox seems inconsistent. For a game about making narrow dodges, games like phoenix force or jamestown do it much better than this, by not having a long character. Also, the level design. You fight through a lone 3-5 minute level, with a mini-boss, and then a boss that has 3 forms, every level, and if you die you have to do it ALL over again. No checkpoints at bosses or anything. You don't get new lives to start each level, and you can usually gain a total of 1 life per level, but if you lose it and beat the level you start next with 1 less. This poor design just causes you to replay and grind levels. There's a reason there is only 5 levels, about 30 min of gameplay, but by forcing you to constantly redo levels over and over it inflates gameplay, a very cheap tactic. The screen gets so filled up with different colors you can't tell half the time what you can shoot, what you can't and what is your bullets. Also the hyper ability sucks. Jamestown had it right as giving you a shield for a few seconds to move around, as you will need it, and you get it quickly in that game. In this it changes a few bullets by you to stars and you deal increased damage, but it doesn't help much. Also takes forever to get. And since every boss and guy is using the blocking mode to take reduced damage (stupid idea, this isn't a fighting game), you deal such little damage anyways. Jamestown beats this game in mechanics again. \n\nAnother annoying thing with game design; there are different formations and tactics and all these other things that are interesting and change up the gameplay, but once you pick one that's it?!?! For a game boasting so little levels encouraging different gameplay, why can't I try different things out during the campaign, like if I don't think my setup is right for the current level, why should I have to redo all the previous levels and delete my progress....that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Also you cannot change the difficulty, which is stupid. I played on normal and it was too grindy with all the things I mentioned above, and I would have had to start a new campaign and redo everything to try easy. In some games that is acceptable, in a game like this it's not. Now some tryhard people that only play bullet-hell games that love redoing levels till their fingers bleed will love this game, but those people are few and far between. That is why this game and those like it have positive reviews, but only 170 reviews total. Because the only ones playing and reviewing them are the people that solely play these games. So as a gamer that isn't that, this game doesn't get it right.

QP Shooting Dangerous is special to me. \n\nImportant to note out that Once Again, Orange Juice Have Nailed the soundtrack to this game. If your not interested in purchasing the game (Which I think you may be slightly mad in not doing so) Then I would urge you to check out the track list to QP Shooting Dangerous and Suguri as they have been the best track lists I've heard in a very long time.\n\nThe game on my system Runs at a Solid 60fps without fail and set up is very easy. I was expecting trauma as most of the games I buy require you to have to search out a way to get games running properly and to the correct screen measurements (Looking at you eXceed :( )  but with QP , No such problems and everything was ready to go within a matter of moments.\n\nAs for the game itself, Its very bright and colourful. its also very crisp and sharp which I love. Control of QP is very slick and smooth and as with most bullet hell games, the feeling of destruction is very warming to the heart. all for the quest of pudding I may add.\n\nI say, Yes!! Definitely give this one ago as the price is extremely good value, And let the music psych you up as millions of projectiles hurl themselves at you without mercy. \n\nI need to get this soundtrack. :)", "timestamp_created": 1428355531, "timestamp_updated": 1428355531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15235966": {"recommendationid": "15235966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035564749", "num_games_owned": 886, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437632714}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u4e0b\u624b\u306a\u306e\u3088\u3002\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1428330943, "timestamp_updated": 1428330943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15227735": {"recommendationid": "15227735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023359027", "num_games_owned": 841, "num_reviews": 688, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428278987}, "language": "french", "review": "J'ai pas aim\u00e9 le jeu", "timestamp_created": 1428278996, "timestamp_updated": 1428278996, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.417703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15218611": {"recommendationid": "15218611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121339672", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509041824}, "language": "english", "review": "why did i get this\n\n420/69", "timestamp_created": 1428238694, "timestamp_updated": 1428238694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.419966", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15209455": {"recommendationid": "15209455", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995977823", "num_games_owned": 613, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428242364}, "language": "english", "review": "better than touhou", "timestamp_created": 1428184344, "timestamp_updated": 1428184344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15205174": {"recommendationid": "15205174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047510250", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469742547}, "language": "english", "review": "needs more boobs 9/11", "timestamp_created": 1428166334, "timestamp_updated": 1428166334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15202355": {"recommendationid": "15202355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010941743", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428153715}, "language": "english", "review": "Got it as gift.\nThis game is worse in every aspect than Touhou series. \n\nPros:\n+Able to use high resolution\n+Aspect preserved for wide screens\n+full support for controllers\n\nCons:\n-boring theme\n-no powerups progress\n-no balanced risk-rewarding system\n-very few unique play styles\n-uninteresting characters\n-incomplete manual, some key points not explained\n-below average level design\n-for a bullet hell game, the hitbox is a little too large to experience the art of dodging.\n-repetitive gameplay\n-badly written dialog\n-bad soundtracks\n-bugs\n\nFor anyone who is looking for a decent and more serious bullet hell game, stay away from this game and go for Touhou or GundeadliGne series.

All of the characters in this game use two demensional sprites in front of a three dementional background that scrolls as if they are fighting in the skies.\n\n+ The music in this game is very cute and well done. It fits in perfectly with the looks and design of this game. I found myself enjoying the game's music as I played through the game.\n\n+ I have yet to play this game using my keyboard, but using a controller is really nice for this game... once you find out which button does what. Overall, the controls work very smoothly for this game.\n\nCons:\n- Regardless of whatever difficulty you're playing with, this game is VERY unforgiving. Enemies will fly around in all corners and shoot at you endlessly until you either kill them, or wait for them to fly right off the screen.\n\n- While I said earlier it's very fun to play this game with a controller, it's also disappointing to see how many buttons on said controller go unused for this game. (only the 4 main buttons, the left analog stick, and the Start button are useable)\n\nFinal Verdict: 8/10 ~ Overall, I found this game to be very fun and challenging. I enjoy some Shoot 'Em Ups and I am an anime fanatic, but that is not my reason for giving this game a positive review. The graphics, the soundtrack, and the controls appeal to me so much, and you will get used to them pretty quick. I will recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Shoot 'Em Up games and are looking for a challenge because this game's insanely hard difficulty will test you as you try to play through it.\n\nIf you want to play this game and try it out for yourself, then by all means play this game. :D:", "timestamp_created": 1426734933, "timestamp_updated": 1426735217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15,

You start out choosing one of three different styles: Aggressive, Orthodox, or Defensive. Aggressive gives you more attack power but takes longer to charge up hyper mode, Orthodox is the middle ground, and Defensive charges your hyper mode faster but reduces your attack power.\n\nThe Hyper Mode is important because when activated you erase all bullets on screen and gain points based on how many you destroyed. This is important because in QP Dangerous you will be overwhelmed with way more bullets than you can dodge. Bullets disappear when you kill the enemy that created them so can't take too much time. Also in Hyper Mode your combo meter stops decreasing for the duration, allowing you to keep building your score through sections where you can't constantly eliminate enemies. Most importantly though, you're allowed to take one hit in hyper mode without losing a life. This resets your combo counter completely but is a very useful panic button. Hyper mode immediately ends but you can erase a difficult pattern's bullets and have insurance in case you happen to get hit in the next few seconds. Killing a boss while Hyper Mode is active nets you a huge bonus.\n\nAside from the Hyper Mode mechanics, we also have formations that affect how your own bullets work. The bullets you shoot spawn from the R-Bits flying alongside you, and the formations affect how they are positioned. There are over 20 in total, with all of them aside from the default available for purchase with points earned from playing the game. Some of them even increase the score you get in exchange for being more challenging to use well. Every time you start a new game you pick 3 separate formations out of the ones you've unlocked to use and can swap between them at any time during gameplay. I've had a lot of fun experimenting whenever I unlock a new one and quite a few of them have really interesting gimmicks that require completely different strategies to use effectively.\n\nLast off the story is rather simple but the dialogue is entertaining and the whole concept of saving the world's pudding is taken to the comedic extreme.

How could something soo adorably cute actually be that hard, right? They do not lie. Even playing on normal difficulty I'm having to take breaks to prevent rage overloads. By far one of the best shooters I've played in a very long time. Controls are spot on, no wonky hitboxes that may or may not tag a passing bullet, enemy and boss mechanics that will actually require a bit of planning and changing of combat styles. Even easy is no joke as the enemy numbers and attack speed are the same, they simply launch a few less projectiles each volley and bosses lose a couple of their moves. Storyline is hilarious, simply an inugirl in search of pudding. The settings and characters you meet along the way are some of the most cliche yet amazing ever. Probably my largest drive to progress is just to see what new boss they will throw at me next.\n\nIf you like shooters with incredibly tight controls, varied enemies, insane difficulty curves, and wide selection of attack types, you want this game.

By going back and re-beating stages and doing better than you did before, you have the chance to finish with more lives, which means you start the next stage with more lives!\n\nQP Shooting - Dangerous features R-Bits as QP's main method of attacking. During each playthrough of arcade or one save of conquest, you can set 3 different formations of R-Bits. R-Bit formations can be bought at the in game store, featuring the bunny girl Aru. R-Bit formations can do many things, such as sit in front of you, sit behind you, form a shell around you, or even rotate around you.\n\nThe music is very catchy, the art is appealing, and features a fun story. The game doesn't take itself very seriously, which is nice. Sadly the original QP isn't on steam, so QP's relations with the characters in the story isn't very well known to us. There is also the mysterious Kyupita, a character mentioned in game, but never seen.\n\nBonus: If you own 100% Orange Juice, another game created by Orange_Juice and translated by Fruit Bat Factory, you unlock a character in the game.\n\nI highly recommend buying this game.

Im Gegenteil, es ist fantastisch. Jedoch gibt es einige Sachen die ich negativ empfinde und zwar geht das haupts\u00e4chlich an den Schwierigkeitsgrad, denn der ist verdammt hoch und selbst auf \"easy\" ist das spiel eine Herausforderung. Das Spiel ist ziemlich Anf\u00e4nger unfreundlich. Es gibt keine Checkpoints und man kann sich das Spielgeschehen nicht ein wenig einfacher gestalten wenn es einem doch \u00fcberfordert ( Das Spiel \"Gundemonium Recollection\" macht das meiner Meinung nach am besten ) Zwar gibt es im Conquest Modus einzelne Checkpoints, diese sind jedoch nur eine kleine Hilfe und keine Gro\u00dfe um das Spiel zu beenden, da die Leben zum Anfang  jedes Level beibehalten werden. Das bedeutet man k\u00f6nnte zum Beispiel mit nur einem Leben im letzten Level ankommen und das ist sicherlich ein Problem f\u00fcr den Spieler. Das bedeutet: Die vorherigen Level besser beenden um im n\u00e4chsten bessere chancen zu haben. Wer sich aber nicht vom sehr hohen schwierigkeitsgrad abschrecken l\u00e4sst und auch etwas shoot em' up erfahrung mitbringt kann hier ein wirklich sch\u00f6nes Spiel genie\u00dfen. Die Level und Bossgegner sind sehr sch\u00f6n designt und jedes Level ist absolut au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnlich, nicht zu vergessen auch die total lustige Story und die erfrischenden Dialoge zwischen dem Spieler und den Gegnern.\nZu den Errungenschaften: Die Errungenschaften sind ALLE sehr schwer zu bekommen und sind noch einmal eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Herausforderung als schon das Spiel an sich. Wer also eine Herausforderung sucht sollte sich dieses Spiel auf jeden Fall zulegen!

one of those genres that I can't get enough of. While I love older games such as Life Force, XEXEX, and Twin Cobra, I tend to play danmaku titles. You know what I'm talking about right? Dodonpachi, Mushihime-sama Futari, Crimzon Clover, etc. These games are also known as pudding-hells. \n\nQP Shooting is by the guys that put out 100% Orange Juice. How do you go from that to a 2D shooter? I thought this was some kinda joke. It seems like every doujin developer has a danmaku in their pocket. Still, curiousity got the better of me, so I bought this game. \n\nAs it turns out, this game is legit. \nHmm..Leaving ya'll in suspense doesn't quite work, when you can see the big fat thumbs-up. Oh well.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but the nonsense plot goes sorta like this: In a world where the very existence of bullets is being threatened, one dog-girl can make a difference. QP must brave five stages of intense pudding-filled action. Like any other super-human or prototype-ship, QP has three lives and dies in a single hit. Also, unlike arcade games, you don't get any continues. Fans of credit-feeding? Too bad. I'm going to spoil the ending to this game right now.\n\nSPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT\nQP becomes the Guardian of Bullets and defeats the Sweet Breaker.\n\nWhat a shame. I ruined the most riveting storyline of 2014 for everybody.\nMoving right along...\n\nSince this is a danmaku game, expect to be overwhelmed by lots of pudding. QP Shooting isn't quite like all the other shmups. \n\nBefore you even start the game, you have to decide on your Rbit formations. You can have up to three, and you're obligated to switch between them when the situation calls for it. At the start you have some basic formations: a spread shot, a rear-shot, and a narrow power-shot. There's 27 formations in all, and they can include all sorts of wacky combinations. Right now I'm messing around with orbit, twin-shot, and niagara formations. Orbit is fairly decent for getting those weak enemies that like to get away, while the twin-shot provides power as well as flexibility. Niagara is just weird. There's a forward shot, but the Rbits float near the top of the screen and drench everything below with pudding. There isn't any best formation, since everyone has their own play-style and preference. So feel free to experiment, and find one that works for you.\n\nNext up is your hyper mode. As you wreck havoc, a meter fills up. Once it hits 100-150% you can unleash the hyper. Aside from an increased amount of damage, baddies cough up more chain-building stars, and nearby pudding disappears. If you're not collecting stars, your combo-chain will break, and the score will suffer big-time. Death also breaks chains, so try to avoid that too (could be difficult!). One of the other benefits to using hyper is that while it's active your chain is safe (don't get hit by any porridge though!) So what are you? Orthodox, Aggressive, or Defensive? This affects the strength of your hyper as well as how long it lasts. \n\nEach stage consists of the usual mix of weakies, toughies, and everything in-between. Weakies die to a light sneeze, while toughies require a bit of firepower to bring down. Toughies also tend to have armor. This is temporary but it severely limits how much damage you do to them. The thing is, while they can and will fill the screen with pudding, all you have to do is destroy them and all their wishes for your untimely death will turn into lovely stars. Yep, just like other shooters, QP Shooting has pudding-cancelling. You don't have to be in hyper mode either. This is where all that time spent figuring out the best Rbit formations pays off. Keep in mind though that you're going to WANT baddies to clutter your screen, just so you collect more stars when you destroy them.\n\nUnlike most shooters, the bosses in this game aren't just some huge target with a ton of heavy weaponry. They move around, they summon help, and that's a major opportunity for pudding-cancelling. All of the bosses have between 3 and 5 phases, and they'll throw around all kinds of unique patterns and special tricks. This makes for boss-battles that can be really entertaining, since they require the player to approach them differently. QP Shooting isn't just another shmup, where you spend every boss-fight, holding down the laser button and making millimeter-tight dodges.\n\nThe overall difficulty of this game is on the lower side. There are four difficulty settings, but for the most part the difference is incremental and not dramatic (aside from a few surprises). It's best to start with normal, see how far that gets you, then drop down to easy for a little while. Once you get a handle on things, then you can work towards the harder difficulties. While you can't continue, the extra lives are surprisingly generous. There's also a conquest mode, where you can practice formations and stages. The setup is a little weird though. You have to beat a stage, then save the game. When you load your save, you can choose what stage to practice.\n\nThis is a really enjoyable shooter, but I have a couple issues with it. These can be fixed pretty easily I believe, since they involve the UI. When holding down the \"slow\" button, a \"THIS IS YOUR HIT-POINT! SAY HELLO HIT-POINT!\" message circles QP and her hitbox. Naturally QP only dies when her hitbox is touched by pudding. This game operates under the assumption that players know what a hitbox is, so why the message? It's just a distraction. This also applies to the hyper mode indicator. This larger circle surrounding QP lets the player know they have hyper, since their eyes can't always check the top of the screen. All this seems a bit much. Wouldn't a subtle aura suffice? Something noticeable but not distracting. Players aren't going to care if they have 124% or 109%. They'll active the hyper when they need it, whether its for scoring or survival. All I'm asking for is an option to remove this unnecessary info, so I can focus on not getting killed.\n\nQP Shooting - Dangerous!! is well worth a look. As shmup-starved as Steam is, I'm willing to accept anything. However, I can assure you that this recommendation isn't a result of low-standards. The 2D shooter has been around for 30+ years, so I don't tolerate screw-ups.

Okosan would be proud.\n\n[h1]Long Review:[/h1]\n\n[quote=QP Shooting - Dangerous!!]A mysterious nemesis has taken pudding away from the world. Can a lone heroine with a sweet tooth stop their nefarious plans? \nIt's time to get back your pudding... again! [/quote]\n\nQP Shooting was a delight to finally see on the Steam store. While it's price is high compared to other shoot-em-up's on the market (eXceed for example) I'd say it's justified with it's many varied play styles, graphics, etc.\n\n[b]Gameplay: 8/10[/b]\nIt's gameplay is like your typical bullet hell, but with some visible charms added in, the biggest being formations. Formations allow you to change the style your firing your bullets at, allowing you to hit more bullets in a certain area, switch your bullets to hit enemies from behind you, etc. You start with 3 of these, and can purchase up to 28 (Yes. 28 formations!) of them as you play and progress in the game. Another thing available to you is the play style, which affects how your hyper works. This is very helpful for those who are still practicing the swing of things or want a certain way to fight during hyper mode.\n\nPast that, there is a good variety of (strangely cute) enemies and bosses, of which some designs may even provide a small chuckle or a questioning \"Why is a tree attacking me?\" as you continue on your conquest with pudding.\n\n[b]Graphics: 7/10[/b]\nFirst off, for those who played 100% Orange Juice: Look at QP in her full vectored glory!\n\nThe graphics are nowhere near top-notch, but for what they are: they are good. I think the coloring choices and graphics are perfect for the style and attitude that this game attempts to portray, and definitely give a cheery vibe as you go on your quest for the elusive pudding.\n\nOne thing I have to comment on though is the background scenery you see as you play through stages. It gives a 2-D in a 3-D environment feel, and as soon as I saw it, I instantly got nostalgia of Ragnarok Online. This touch definitely gave it a much more connective feeling towards me, personally, but I'm sure we all can agree how enticing 2D-in-3D always seems to look.\n\n[b]Music: 8/10[/b]\nI'll try not to give a very biased view on this. The music is catchy, it's cheery, and it fits the mood. While I personally like it, it may not be for everyone. That doesn't mean you can't easily mute it, though.\n\nThe music gives an exciting pace to the gameplay, but it is very, very short. Most of them seem to sound like 20-second loops, so if you plan on playing this game for a long period of time, I'd recommend turning it off if you value your sanity.\n\n[b]Story: 5/10[/b]\nWait. Scroll up and read the quote at the beginning of this review. Yep, that's the story. Carry on.\n\nIn a more serious tone... While it is a incredibly childish storyline, with not much of plot twistery to boot, it still gains some momentum thanks to the graphics and music. It does feel like a cheery stroll to find the pudding, running into friends, beating the love out of said friends, etc. and as my broken record says, the mood says it all.\n\nDon't play this game for story. Play it for the gameplay. It's fun.\n\n[b]Overall: 7/10[/b]\nIt's a good game. It's a fun game. Throw down your bucks and gain a ton of hours in return. If you must, wait until a sale. Use your card-farmed monies. Whatever you have to do. If you like shoot-em-ups, you WILL like this game. With it's many different play styles, modes, and stages, it's sure to keep you entertained and give you your money's worth in exchange.\n\nNow go and get that pudding.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention.

Al\u00e9m que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o precisa ser um especialista nesse tipo de jogo para conseguir joga-lo. \n\nEle \u00e9 dif\u00edcil, mas ele vai acompanhando a progress\u00e3o do jogador sem precisar fazer que o mesmo entre em modo masoquista para progredir.  \n\nEle tem um modo muito interessante chamado Conquest. Nele voc\u00ea pode salvar a fase onde voc\u00ea parou e repetir quantas vezes quiser. Caso voc\u00ea morra, pode repetir de onde parou at\u00e9 passar da fase. E tamb\u00e9m tem o modo Arcade que \u00e9 padr\u00e3o em qualquer jogo, voc\u00ea joga at\u00e9 o fim ou at\u00e9 onde conseguir chegar. \n\nVoc\u00ea pode usar 3 modos de tiros diferentes, onde voc\u00ea pode mudar no meio do jogo. Por exemplo, voc\u00ea t\u00e1 usando o tiro padr\u00e3o para atirar para frente e do nada aparece inimigos atr\u00e1s, voc\u00ea muda o modo de tiros para \"Back\" e seus tiros v\u00e3o acertar os inimigos que est\u00e3o atr\u00e1s de voc\u00ea. E tamb\u00e9m tem o Hyper Mode, onde ativando ele seus tiros ficam mais fortes e voc\u00ea tem alguns segundos de imunidade. \n\nVoc\u00ea morrendo ou ganhando \u00e9 dado para voc\u00ea dinheiro, onde esse dinheiro vai servir para voc\u00ea comprar novas magias (modos de tiro), onde v\u00e3o poder ser usados no jogo; recomendo comprar a magia Orbit no inicio. Esse sistema de compra de magias \u00e9 um bom incentivo para te manter horas jogando esse jogo, uma boa ideia que deixa o jogo atraente mesmo tendo jogado varias vezes. \n\nEu n\u00e3o esperava muito do jogo quando comprei, mas logo me surpreendi com o gameplay e sua trilha sonora divertida, sem contar o bom humor e as referencias a animes e jogos japoneses; quem jogou Persona 4, vai entender o golpe final do boss da stage 4. \n\nInfelizmente como esse jogo \u00e9 de 2012 e s\u00f3 saiu agora no ocidente, voc\u00ea vai visualizar ele em tamanho 4:3 no seu monitor. Mas n\u00e3o que isso v\u00e1 estragar a divers\u00e3o.

QP Shooting Dangerous!! charms with it's cheerful style and tons of gaming customization options!\nThe game has 2 play modes - the classic arcade one, no continue allowed, and you play the levels in order, or the Conquest Mode, that saves your progress and allows you to progress one stage at a time or practice a stage over and over, so when you go arcade you can rack up the highscore!\nThe most important game mechanic for me is this : when you kill an enemy, all it's bullets on the screen become stars, that you automatically gather and they fill your Hyper bar. So most of the time your best chance of survival is killing everything on screen in a timely fashion :p Once you get hit ( you start with 3 hearts, enough for 3 hits) all the bullets on the screen disappear, but new ones are there in no time and you have like a second or 2 of invulnerability. Another major mechanic is the Hyper ability - it get's filled with you gathering stars and when you activate it all bullets on screen turn into stars, all stars turn into yellow stars (more valuable than the normal green stars) and you get extra damage. Around the hyper ability there are 3 gameplay styles - Orthodox, Defensive or Aggressive style. Orthodox is the balanced one, Aggressive gives you more damage in and out of Hyper mode, but the length of the mode is significantly reduced, and Defensive mode - the opposite of aggressive. I played the aggressive one when I progressed, but I think the orthodox is really the one I had the most success with.\nThe way you shoot is determined by the formation you choose - and there are 3 you can \"equip\" out of 28 available / unlockable. You get points to unlock further formations by playing the game and achieving highscores. I have not experimented or unlocked enough formations, but I like the default ones - you pretty much need a focus fire in front of you, one for a spread that you'll use most of the time, and one with reverse shooting direction, so you can take care of backstabbing enemies.\nDon't kid yourself, the game looks cute and the story is hilarious ( PUDDING!!1), but the levels are pretty tough even on normal difficulty settings. The controls are tight, there is full controller support and you can even rebind not only your keyboard controls, but even your gamepad keys - I love this!\nThe best part for me as let's player is the fact, that once your game is over, you're presented with the option to save your run, so you can watch it later - I find this awesome, as commentating while playing a bullet hell is a damn hard task :p\nQP Shooting Dangerous!! is a pretty well rounded and cute looking bullet hell, a must have for every fan on the genre and with 4 difficulty settings to chose from, maybe for newcomers as well. Add steam trading cards to the low price tag and this becomes a really easy recommendation!\n\nTL:DR you can check my let's play videos, the first one is kind of on overview of the game :\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=341797065\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=341797064\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=341797062\n", "timestamp_created": 1416021310, "timestamp_updated": 1416021310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.720455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12945228": {"recommendationid": "12945228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063433715", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416397217}, "language": "english", "review": "Uncomplicated but challenging Bullet Hell game that doesn't take itself too seriously, sporting a good soundtrack and quirky characters.\nThe mechanics are pretty easy to get accustomed to, but hard to master - this game uses a Chain system for scoring, gives you the ability to engage a Hyper Mode that is important both for survival and for scoring, and allows you to pick three shot types per run that you can switch between on the fly.\nClever usage of the right shot type in the right situation can make the difference between nightmarish bullet walls from all sides and a mostly empty screen, so some strategy is required - you can't just rely on the basic Front shot type all game and expect to win.\nThat said, the game is never unfair - for instance, you're given advance warning when enemies appear from locations you might not expect them to appear from, a gesture that some other Bullet Hell shooters today still don't seem to deem necessary.\n\nOverall, a quite fun game. Fans of the Bullet Hell genre will probably feel right at home.

What makes them interesting is that you can choose how they fire. That is, in front of you, behind you, to the side, rotating, and so on. In any particular play you've got a set of 3 Rbit formations you can switch on the fly. This means picking a few bullet patterns to handle different enemy and boss patterns. There's a total of 28 different shot patterns that QP has access to, but only 5 of them start unlocked. You can unlock more as you play the game more, and these unlocks are persistent through plays, giving the game some permanant progression without making QP objectively more powerful (as opposed to something like Danmaku Unlimited's upgrade system). You may or may not want to pick a new set of formations really, since the starting ones are the standard suspects that you'd be used to. Maybe you want to try something crazy? Try getting the trap formation (which doesn't shoot, it places the Rbits down in a spot for as long as you're using the formation, and the Rbits do damage to enemies that collide with them), then place that where you know a boss is going to be sitting. Certainly things like the trap formation are very situational, but that's fine since you have access to three that you can switch between with the press of a button at any time on any given play.\n\nThe Rbits certainly don't revolutionize the genre or evern change it very much at all, but still, they're a very nice touch.\n\nThe only thing I could really bring up as a negative is that I'm not particularly into the music. The music isn't bad, but it's certainly not something I'd listen to outside of playing the game.

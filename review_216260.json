However once I tried it with a controller I could definitely see why it requires one.\n With one stick being used for foot placement and the other stick for direction, combining these two inputs with the modifiers (power,defensive,fancy) and the need for having proper timing means the array of shots becomes diverse and unpredictable. Also unlike other cricket versions this does not just descend into a boring slog match with every shot going for a 4 or a six.\n I have been able to use this to explain the game of cricket better to my children which means they enjoy cricket even more now and just for that alone I would recommend this to everyone who loves cricket.\n\nPros\n- Great controls allow for diverse batting\n- Bowling is actually fun\n- Career mode where you actually need to develop your player from a rookie to an expert\n- Community generated content\n- A great physics engine\n\nCons\n- You need to be online to play\n- Occassionally the AI can behave strangely when running between wickets\n- Superhuman fielders\n- The cricket grounds are not particulary diverse", "timestamp_created": 1483759173, "timestamp_updated": 1483759173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29053187": {"recommendationid": "29053187", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052664013", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504342032}, "language": "english", "review": "Really enjoying this game, the gameplay has the right amount of complexity to bring in important aspects of batting and bowling, while remaining simple enough to pick up quickly.\nThe game options are great, quick matches for local multiplayer games and I'm thoroughly enjoying the career mode.\nThe graphics and effects are more than adequate and the features are excellent!\n", "timestamp_created": 1483684176, "timestamp_updated": 1483684176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28971745": {"recommendationid": "28971745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131727103", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483522191}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty Good Game, can be rather boring at times", "timestamp_created": 1483439022, "timestamp_updated": 1483439022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28966443": {"recommendationid": "28966443", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207702835", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489077929}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite an interesting game with excellent graphics & real time events.\n\nNeed some improvements:\n-----------------------------\n1) Need more precise weather events/updates.

As skills get stronger (i.e Front foot strokes) your success rate with these moves will improve.\n\nAwesome cricket game, which you should get an XBox controller for, to fully experience it properly. Using the sticks to bat is the best ever, and most realistic batting contol i have experienced, once you get used to it. I recommend time in the nets, it builds skills and also helps you learn timing and how to use the controls. Make sure you change the bowling machine to throw you some spin bowling too.

What condition is the pitch in? What condition is the ball in? Where are the fielders? Has the career AI captain changed my fielding set up again? (yes, yes he has) Whats the weather for the second day look like? Did my bouncer into the ribs of the batsman do anyting to unnerve them? Is it worthwhile? Should I run after hitting the ball? I don't know because the camera isn't facing the ball yet.\n\nThese are questions that you have answered in near any other cricket game. There's no point playing a career game as a bowler if you have no way of knowing what condition the pitch or ball is in, let alone that your fielding setups will occasionally change without your knowledge (minimaps guys comeon).\n\nSome of the above info is accessible, but through many different menus rather than whilst playing it which slows an already slow game down - Except ball and pitch condition, you just have to figure out if the ball will swing or not...\n\nCareer mode is a great idea, so so much potential, but the constant loading screens and lack of information about what is happening - plus the fact that a 16 year old is just thrown into first team matches against much better players - make it so frustrating.\n\nGreat potential to be an amazing representation of cricket..

The batting is balanced: the forward defensive stroke is very safe, while the aggressive shots are likely to end in you losing your wicket - you are rewarded for playing the right shot in the right situation (as opposed to blitzing every ball for six \u00e0 la EA Sports Cricket). You have little time to react to a fast ball, and split-second decisions are required, just like in real life.\n\nThe AI is reasonable - the fielding positioning is questionable, but the actual gameplay is very good. The amount of misfields and overthrows are about right compared to real life. The career mode is fantastic - you control only your player, so if you get out for barely any runs as a batsman, that's the end of your contribution for the innings: you can't then just control the next seven or eight batsman that bat after you. As a result, the games are quicker (you can simulate the bits you're not playing), and your performance is more in the spotlight.\n\nOf course there are a few problems: the commentary is about as wooden as the cricket bats, the animations are a little bit glitchy from time to time (certainly nowhere near EA Sports Cricket or Ashes 2013 levels), and there may be a slight mismatch in run rates between the simulated and live-mode game.

(there could be mechancs like that, could not tell), it's fun dealing with each delivery for its merits since the controls are well designed. \n\nThe bowling is more difficult to master, but I felt effectiveness in employing an overall strategy rather than just trying for a wicket every ball. That feels like quite a feat for a cricket game since in other games there's usually a sweet spot or a common strategy to rinse-repeat. Didn't feel like that in this game. That said, I'm not quite convinced by the spin bowling in this game. Hurts my thumbs.\n\nI feel the statistics element of the game could be improved. Cause effect between games played and statistics (outside of career mode) should be clearer. And the career mode could have tournaments in it - would make sense to me. Also why can't a batting alrounder open the batting? :)\n\nOverall I have fun playing this game. Can play, watch some TV, chill out.

Gone are target recticules that you place where you want the ball to land. In their place is a method that requires timing and finesse, and feels an awful lot more like you are actually bowling.\n\nBatting strokes are well implemented, with the full range available to you including fancy tricks such as reverse sweeps and ramp shots. Footwork is as important to batting as it is in real life too, and if you get this really wrong then it doesn't matter what stroke you choose, you'll still be in trouble.\n\nThere are a wide variety of ways of playing the game, with all formats included. They've also got around the issue of not having any licenses by allowing you to automatically download the highest rated user mods, which quickly adds in the most important national and international teams and players. I was particularly pleased that they've included a Career mode, allowing you to take a single player all the way from local obscurity to international success.\n\nThis all sounds great right? However, after a little while a few significant issues came to light that mean I just can't make a general recommendation, as much as I want to.\n\n[b][u]The Bad[/u][/b]\n\nThere is a massive leap in difficulty between the Amateur and Professional skill levels when you're batting. To me, this is the biggie. At Amateur level I can easily score centuries with my wet behind the ears rookie without even trying. It's so forgiving, I don't really need to concentrate much on what I'm doing at all. Switch to the next difficulty up though, and there is an enormous difficulty spike, which try as I might I just can't get over.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like that the game can be made that tough. Hell, I'd love to be in a position where I can work towards playing at Professional difficulty. Unfortunately, the grind and the way the game punishes you for even the slightest mistakes at that difficulty just saps any enjoyment I have, leaving me with no desire to continue banging my head against a brick wall. \n\nThere has to be some way of easing you in, some kind of halfway house that helps you grow into it. I've spent hours in the nets and in practice matches, and the feedback it gives you is helpful, but you don't get that help once you step into an actual match that matters, and the small margin for error has often left me wondering what I did wrong that got my batsman out.\n\nAnother gripe I have is the reliance on red, green and yellow to show whether a delivered ball is short, on a length or full. I know I'm in the minority here, but being partially colourblind makes this even harder. It's not bad enough that it is a deal breaker for me, but some other way of showing the difference, or even just being able to customise the colours would be really helpful.\n\nThen there's fielding. There are a few issues here. The first is that the game doesn't provide a fielding 'radar' when you're batting, and the only way of seeing how the opposition have set the field is by going to first person view and looking around. In general I love it when a dev is this committed to realism. The problem here is I think they've gone too far. Having to do this every single time you think they might have made a fielding change is a massive drag, and becomes a real pain.\n\nAnother problem with this is the way they've implemented the camera for tracking the ball and helping you judge whether a run is on or not. A lot of the time it works, but I've lost count of when the camera angle chosen doesn't show me quickly enough for me to make a decision. In real life you'd be able to glance quickly and make a judgement, but this obviously isn't possible here. \n\n[b][u]Conclusions[/u][/b]\n\nThis game is so frustratingly close to being amazing its ridiculous. If I wrote a checklist of all the things I want in a cricket game, this game meets almost all of them. Unfortunately, the few areas it falls short are so important, I just can't make a general recommendation.\n\nHowever, I can absolutely see there is a section of the market out there that would love this, If you have faster reactions than me and/or a greater tolerance for the grind it takes to make the leap in difficulty the game presents, then go ahead and have a blast.", "timestamp_created": 1455472773, "timestamp_updated": 1455472909, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607361", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21113794": {"recommendationid": "21113794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047928875", "num_games_owned": 351, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 19358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510791645}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the nicest cricket game to come out in a while.

Picking up the ball that is simply lying on the ground can be quite the task. Batting in multiplayer can also present a few problems most notably when they are deciding whether to run or not. Standing in front of the crease is also an issue when clearly the bowler or wicket keeper has the ball in their hand. \n\nBut overall, I'd call myself a casual cricket fan (I mainly watch Tests) - I KNOW, people find that odd too lol. This is an excellent cricket game that really holds strong to core values of real life cricket. I'd go as far as to say that this is a cricket simulator, because the attention to detail of the batting is quite remarkable that puts other cricket games to shame.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Batting is a blast once you learn the techniques, the first 4-5 hours of gameplay I was absolutely hopeless getting 15 runs and out, you really need to learn the controls, (which overall isn't too difficult)]\n- Bowling is also one of my favourite features, I never thought I'd enjoy bowling as much, being a casual cricket fan, this put some perspective in the techniques that real life bowlers used and gave me some appreciation for what they do.\n- The Interace is intuitive and I personally feel it's better than Rugby League Live 3's.\n- The Academy is also a great feature.\n\nThe Bad: \n\n- Fielding is overall O.K. Although I still feel like I need to manually be able to hit the wickets with maybe a Right Analogue Push or better known as the R3 Button on the playstation.\n- Commentary definitely needs an update in the next game, (It's not terrible but it just needs more chit chat and dialogue, with commentators talking to each other etc.\n- Graphics needed an overhaul, but since they're using the same game engine as Rugby League, I can't wait to see what the next game brings for us.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n- Always Online DRM (This is really Ugly, like fugly) \n-Tru Blu Entertainments price on steam is a f'ing joke, I bought the limited edition on EBAY which comes with a controller and I got it for $33 AUD with free shipping, on steam it's equivalent to $70 AUD.\n-Tru Blue Entertainmment\n\nI'll rate this in 3 categories plus with an overall as a 'game' and a 'cricket game'.\n\nGraphics - 5/10\nGameplay 7.5/10\nAudio/Interface 7/10\n\nOverall as a game 6.5/10\nOverall as a cricket game 8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1452852063, "timestamp_updated": 1452852169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558011", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20522220": {"recommendationid": "20522220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192158243", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499274642}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably the greatest cricket game ever or maybe the only cricket game out there :3\nGO GET IT IF YOU'RE A DIE HARD CRICKET FAN.", "timestamp_created": 1452780066, "timestamp_updated": 1452780066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20435367": {"recommendationid": "20435367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133035947", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 20580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513102451}, "language": "english", "review": "The BEST cricket game", "timestamp_created": 1452385034, "timestamp_updated": 1452385034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20373704": {"recommendationid": "20373704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141587915", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 5658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470859496}, "language": "english", "review": "The best cricket game but need to add keyboard controls.Its difficult to learn bowling but batting is ok.Need some more realism in IA like when left handed batsman come you should go with offspinner.In test matches batsmen play too aggresively with ODI strike rate and this needs a fix.Career mode is unrealistic as my player play every matches.The player should be dropped if is out of form and should get injured sometimes.", "timestamp_created": 1452171977, "timestamp_updated": 1452171977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20369632": {"recommendationid": "20369632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069426175", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 16441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1073, "last_played": 1516275664}, "language": "english", "review": "This is by far the best cricket game ever, after Ashes'09 i never thought we would ever get a good cricket game.

Although it is decent, I do have a few issues nothing major but issues nonetheless that I feel should Big Ant address them it make the new release a lot better.\n\nLack of customization in career.\n\nFor me any sports game that allows you to put yourself in the game has to really pull out the stops for it to feel like a representation of yourself and have it as you want it and while it's not bad, not having any options to change bowling actions or having a preferred style of batting whether you're more into wristy flicks and a batsman who is looking to time to ball instead of someone who is a brute and is looking to put a lot of power into the stroke. \n\nI think BAS missed a great opportunity to make the career mode one of the highlights but as it happens it's just lacking thus far.\n\nBatting.\n\nWhile for the most part, batting is generally okay I feel there is not a lot of variety in shot animations. Very seldom you will see a batsman go full blooded and extend the stroke for say a straight drive or a on drive as you see in game, for the most part they will generallly push the ball back down the ground and allow the timing to get the runs.\n\nAlso why no normal advancing shots? Seems strange you can't use your feet to work a ball into the gap instead of trying to launch it out of the ground.\n\nBowling.\n\nMuch like batting, bowling is in general done very well, can't argue with the variation given, although it's a little irritating that left handed bowlers stats are coded incorrectly Eg: When making a left arm pacer, in order to have a good outswinger from the left hander you have to set the best delivery to \"In Swinger\" perhaps a little nit picky but still, it shouldn't happen.\n\nFielding and AI\n\nProbably the weakest area for me. Well struck shots that are next to fielders just result in them standing still then diving too late to get the ball and that's rather frustrating to watch.\n\nCatching animations are also a little odd especially when the wicketkeeper is catching edges istead of just taking a regulation catch they will turn their back towards the ball and somehow just dive on it but catch it nonetheless although funny I don't think we would see MS Dhoni do that :P\n\nBowling against AI feels kind of frustrating at times, they seem to have a real tendency to sweep the spinners a lot even to balls pitched outside off stump and there isn't much penalty for it, not had them top edge or anything like that.\n\nEven against pace bowlers, bowling on a good length swinging away from off stump or even just bowling seam up outside the off stump they will just fly swat it away to the leg side without much thought yet when I try it, of course I conveniently edge it straight to the slips.

It's likely that, due to the long wait for a cricket game to be financially successful, people were willing to bend over backwards in order to praise the title, in spite of all its flaws, and DBC14 has them aplenty. DBC14 was downright broken on release and had any other game released like it did, it's likely refunds would have been demanded all across the board. Thankfully patches have remedied most of the issues, but these fixes were long overdue and should have been in the base game. \n\nBefore I get to gameplay, there are a few more things about DBC14 worth discussing. Upon launch, the game loads this sort of \"demo test match\" where you can watch Australia play against England. This is tedious. I understand they want to show off the game's aesthetic but even if you've upgraded the games roster to show real names, the players are still unlicensed in the demo match, the frame rate is woeful, and it's a chore to skip. I understand they were going for a Mario Kart-like title screen where it shows off the gameplay, but in Mario Kart you press a button, you're at the menu. This isn't replacing the loading screen, it's adding to the loading time, and it should be removed from the game. \n\nThat said, the ability to share teams and players online is fantastic, and fosters a great community. Why this hasn't been introduced into other sports titles like FIFA I have no clue, but it's execution is great here, censorship aside (really Big Ant?) Being able to play a career mode is great, but the skill progression is terrible. You can only muster up about 800 RPM if you start a new career as a spinner, rather than the 2000 or so you should be able to get from a young first class player. I've heard this is also an issue with pace bowlers, where you can only bowl a bit over 100 ks an hour, but I've only played as a leg spinner/batsman all-rounder so I haven't verified this. \n\nThere is one glaring issue with batting, that is that there's no incentive to play on the back foot, and that opposition fields are very exploitable. If you play on the front foot to a short ball, your player can always get bat to ball, in some cases you can still hit a boundary, but if you play back foot to a full ball you will almost always be bowled if the ball's line is near/on your stumps. You stand to gain very little at the risk of your wicket playing on the back foot, as it's very easy to accidentally miscalculate the ball's length (even with the red/yellow/green circles), whereas playing front foot almost ensures you will never get bowled. Either there should be an option to make the length-telegraphing more easy (for example an optional difficully check that makes the game enter bullet time after the ball is released from the bowler's hand, showing the red/yellow/green length circle to allow for a less sudden reaction time) or there should not be an option for playing on the back/front foot, and instead the game should take the Brian Lara International Cricket 2005 (a great cricket game that's unfortunately seldom mentioned) approach, where you just choose the direction you're going to hit the ball, and your player automatically goes on the front/back foot dependent on the length of the ball. \n\nQuickly elaborating on the exploitable fielding, it's always easier to go on the front foot, and always premeditate your shots to where there is a gap in the field. Playing on the front foot, the worst that happens is that you miss the ball anyway, and the fields are very rarely changed during an over by the opponent AI, so if there's no cover, just keep going for drives and you can easily get 24-36 runs in an over by pure premeditation.\n\nDespite these flaws, being able to play online against or with a friend is great, though I was left wishing you could 2v2 online with 3 friends, I believe this was possibe offline. Being able to view the ground first person before the ball was bowled and use the games replay mode were cool and the DRS is actually really impressive, even though it's kinda obvious that the umpires will defer to the 3rd Umpire so often just to show off the attention to detail in the DRS. If you are a cricket tragic and you want to play through a virtual career, then go for it (just don't play a spinner like I did, it's kinda insulting how little RPM your player can muster up), or if you want to play against your friends often then you're the type of person who should be buying DBC14, but I can't recommend the game to people beyond that demographic. I found the career mode and online multiplayer to be worth the asking price, even if if wasn't all I had hoped for.\n\nEdit: I usually play this game on my 360, so the hours played isn't very accurate.

Not only am I glad I did, but it has become one of my favorite sports games of all-time.\n\nTl;dr - If you're a fan of the sport, this is simply a must-have. If you have a passing interest, this game could actually help your understanding of the sport and also happens to be extremely fun and satisfying.\n\nOn the surface, just like baseball, cricket is a simple game: throw the ball, hit the ball, catch the ball, curse under your breath when you're out. Just like baseball, though, there is an immense amount of strategic subtlety, and unlike America's pastime, cricket has a much wider range of strategic nuance, offering endless combinations of fielders and bowling styles. DBC14 captures the essence of that strategy by putting players in complete control of their fielding alignments and customizing them for bowlers, batsmen, or both.\n\nWhich brings me to the crux of cricket and of DBC14 - what goes on at that little brown strip in the middle of the field. Bowlers are offered a wide array of options, especially pace bowlers. Toy with line and length, swing the ball to and fro, whatever you want to do to go for wickets. All this complexity is broken down into a relatively straightforward control scheme that is easy to learn but difficult to master. Pace bowling is definitely harder to get the timing on than spin bowling, but it's the pace men who offer the most excitement and get the most wickets.\n\nBatting is also somewhat straightforward. Batsmen have the ability to survey the field and get ideas on how to attack it, can choose to go for a shot in the air or along the ground or play a sweep. It's all mapped out quite cleanly, but the big key I found was timing; especially with pace bowlers, getting a good feel for the rhythm of the deliverly lets batsmen time the ball up and crush it. If the player is in rhythm, it's not difficult to churn out 20-30 runs an over, especially in T20 when bowlers are more aggressive. By that same token, mistime a big swing for the ropes, and you're down a wicket. Bowling AI is smart and will adjust even within overs to cover areas where you're consistently putting the ball, forcing you to stay on your toes and play an all-round innings at the crease.\n\nI will say that running and fielding felt a bit clunky. It was tough to know if I had hit the ball right to a man in the field because of the way the camera swings around, and (at least early on) I had a few run-outs because I got a little trigger-happy, but I also missed out on runs because I couldn't see where the ball was. It'd be helpful, too, when fielding, to have a diagram of where each button throws the ball. I still don't have it down and will find my fielder throwing at the bowler's stumps when the keeper has the other batsman dead to rights. Ultimately, though, I can forgive those things because the most important aspects of the on-field experience are just so strong.\n\nThe game has a variety of ways to play the sport, with all the Test nations, the three major domestic leagues (England, Australia, and India), and a bevy of formats covered, and if you don't like what's on offer, players can create their own content through the Don Bradman Academy, a robust customization engine where everything can be tweaked. (And, since this game contains little or no licensed content, players can create their own approximations of modern cricketers and teams). Players can also create their own leagues, tournaments, tour schedules, and even formats of the game through the DBA. It's a wonderful little tool that adds tremendous depth to what could have otherwise been a rather pedestrian between-match experience, and it might be my favorite feature of the entire game.\n\nI guess my biggest complaints are the lack of licensed content (addressed by the Don Bradman Academy system, but it's not quite the same), and the menu music. They only included a handful of tracks that get quite tiresome after a while, and I haven't found any way to add custom music to the game. That would be a wonderful feature that would keep me playing this game forever. Heck, I'm probably playing this game forever anyway.

The left analog stick is used to choose which foot to play (i.e front or back foot) and the right stick dictates which direction you want to play the shot. Holding the bumper buttons and flicking the right stick in the direction you want to hit the ball, produces different shots. For example, holding the left trigger button with the left stick causes you to hit a lofted shot. It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you master the controls, it feels very intuitive, vastly superior to previous cricket game controls and a lot of fun.\n\nBowling has also been changed for the better. Instead of having a dot on the ground and showing your opponent where you are going to bowl, there is a new control scheme. First, you have to choose the length of the ball that you want to bowl, using the face buttons (i.e A for good length, B for short length or Y for full length). As your bowler approaches the crease, you flick back the right stick and then flick forward in the direction you want to bowl the ball. This is an amazingly new and fresh way to bowl in cricket games. It allows for a more authentic bowling experience and is alot more fun and engaging, then placing a dot on the pitch and just passively pressing buttons. I can't believe the day where I would say that bowling is potentially more fun than batting in a cricket game.\n\nGraphics are nice and crisp. The grounds are rendered really well and the lighting is top-notch.\n\nSounds of the bat hitting the ball are satisfying to hear and the appeals of bowlings are exciting.\n\nOverall, Don Bradman Cricket 14 is an amazing sports game.

I love it.\n\nBradman 14 is the cricket game that we have been waiting for. That's pretty much all you need to know. Finally a developer has cracked the combination of making a game feel like a proper simulation of the sport. It oozes cricketness. Sure, you can play it like a hit and giggle arcade game if you want, but if you also want to make a ponderous innings in the vein of Chris Tavar\u00e9, the game is more than happy for you to go out and block every single ball back to the bowler.\n\nThe graphics are very serviceable, animations are generally good although the bowling action isn't 100% smooth, with the ball popping out of the bowlers hand at slightly odd angles, I suppose rather a tricky thing to model though when you have to allow all the variations in bowling and outcomes that result. Batting is a real joy, I love spending a while at the crease fashioning a score. And then smashing a ball down a patrolling outfielders throat having forgotten he was out there. Foolish.\n\nCareer mode is wonderful. You take control of one person. You perform their every cricketing move, if you fancy it. I generally only bother with batting myself as I am a glory hunter who prefers not to toil too hard. I've not progressed too far, but I am happy in my role as a county cricketer. One day I'll develop the patience and progress to international level. Maybe.\n\nThere's still a couple of minor aesthetic issues with the game although the devs are actively patching it at the moment. Hopefully these will get resolved.\n\nAnyway, this review can all be boiled down to this: do you like playing cricket games on your computer? If so, buy this, you can't go wrong.

I have played all the EA and many Codemasters offerings from the 90s through to '11 when the last Codemasters game came out.\n\nHowever, baring that in mind I cannot recommend this game. This is based on a variety of factors and especially the price. This game, as far as I am aware, has never been on sale and has stayed at \u00a335 or $50. For that amount of money you can buy far superior sports titles that are less likely to crash, do not require an internet connection whenever you launch it and look and play better. This game has complicated controls, that aren't easy to pick up because the tutorials (last time I played) haven't been updated. The sound is just terrible, between dull and repetitive commentary (although those that like cricket might say that it is quite spot on) and poor on the field sounds I usually turn the volume off and listen to a podcast.\n\nFurthermore, the game crashes way too much. In the past two weeks there have been a rush of patches after 6 months of silence. They made some nice changes but the whole game has been too unstable. This is especially the case considering I am not on any kind of beta channel and there is no option to only get major patches rather than the smaller ones the studio has been putting out.\n\nThe biggest issue, however, is that (based on my last playthrough) the game is NOT an accurate simulation. Between bowlers consistently bowling down leg and batsmen playing at nothing down off this is not cricket. Because it fails at its main task it is difficult to recommend the game. When including the other issues and price it is impossible, in my opinion, to give this game a passing grade.\n", "timestamp_created": 1434760602, "timestamp_updated": 1434760602, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467835", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16507489": {"recommendationid": "16507489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004186208", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495050004}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like Cricket, you'll like Don Bradman's!", "timestamp_created": 1434659158, "timestamp_updated": 1434659158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16472447": {"recommendationid": "16472447", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990799150", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487414606}, "language": "english", "review": "excellent cricket game, and one definitely for fans of the sport, if you've played the game or an avid fan, you won't find it all that difficult to pick up, if you haven't then you better be ready to learn as this has one hell of a steep learning curve. but once you've learned how to crack play it becomes an extremely fun game. my two complaints would be spin bowling is a little buggy depending on what controller you use, i can never get it past half way on spin, and the aspect ratio of a non standard screen doesn't seem to work", "timestamp_created": 1434552402, "timestamp_updated": 1434552402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16414453": {"recommendationid": "16414453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004199173", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434368392}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has so much potential but is seriously let down by the most comedy of errors.\n\nThe game advertises a \"2v2\" concept giving the implications that you'll be able to have a 4 player match mode, however upon discovery it turns out that its 2v2 on the same computer.

Some of the players downloaded online do really look-a-like.\nStadiums are very few, also changing the casual match settings takes time, hope they make an easy menu for this next time.\nCommentary is good, funny, enjoyable.\nGameplay is very fun, batting you can actually play shots in 360 degrees.

The only problem in this mode is that, the difficulty can get increased if you start doing well, and you need very good reflexes to bat at difficulties above PRO. Also, you cannot change the batting order of your player, at any point of time in career mode.\n+ There are lots of options to customise the game - pitch settings/weather/overs, etc.\n+ Game can get real addictive, once you know the basics.\n+ Great graphics and animations.\n\n- Online system is quite broken, but if you have friends who own the game, then it's easy to play matches with them.\n-  I know it's not much, but you cannot see the bowling statistics fully in the scoreboard. Also, some other statistics which were present in the EA versions of cricket are absent.\n- No auto save features while playing.

When I saw this game, while browsing through the game store, my interest was peaked. I had been looking for a worthy successor to 'Brian Lara Cricket' - a great game in it's own right - and this seemed to fit the bill. I was a little hesitant about the cost, but after reading the reviews I took the plunge.\n\nI have rarely enjoyed my first couple of hours playing a game as much as I did this one. Graphically - brilliant! Atmospherically - it's like being there. The controls are instinctive, and the ball moves dynamically depending on how the bat connects with it - as it should. I still haven't mastered the field settings but the day, as they say, is yet young. Another aspect that surprised me was the depth of history that the team choices can offer. We all have our sporting heroes and to be able to pick a team with them in it is great - even from some time ago.\n\nAll-in-all, I would highly recommend this game to all cricket fans.

During this time it was a battle of two publishers: Electronic Arts and Codemasters. Early iterations of the game were fun and lacked the realism that most sports games demand. If you're considering DBC 14 I also recommend searching for EA's Cricket 96 (PC) or Codemaster's Shane Warne Cricket 99 (PS1) on eBay. \n\nBut back to more current matters. DBC 14 is by far the most authentic cricket game since the EA Sports release of Cricket 2005 for the PC and PS2. Running the game for the first time, you are met with an update that thankfully changes all player names to real names. I hope to see an update in the future that contains real stadium names too. Once in the game, you have various game options from 5-over a side to full blown test cricket. You can also create yourself and move up the ranks of world cricket.\n\nThe practice arena is great too, reminiscent of a training nets session. From time to time I find myself relaxing in the nets just having a hit. I've only accumulated a few hours on the PC version but I did so, migrating from the XBOX 360 version. DBC 14 has a solid frame rate and feels very smooth. One aspect that still needs improving is the commentary. While not bad, it's not great. It's certainly not as annoying as other sports games (like PES) but not as smooth or free flowing. \n\nI love the camera angles in this game. When playing solo, you are shown your player from the 3rd person perspective. While this is standard fare for bowling in all cricket games, it's quite refreshing for batting and makes the game feel more authentic. Fielding is decent too and the camera angles during play are superb.\n\nAt the time of writing this, I'm in search for games during the Steam sale. However I was quite willing to drop the full price for this game for two reasons: Supporting not just a local developer, but one that is willing to put the time and effort to capture a sport that itself has captured millions around the world.", "timestamp_created": 1419536965, "timestamp_updated": 1419536965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.739269", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13568005": {"recommendationid": "13568005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074833486", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 41998, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503486603}, "language": "english", "review": "Firstly, kudos to Big Ant Studios for developing what is undoubtedly the finest cricket game to date.\n\nFor those of you who love cricket and have an appreciation for the nuances of the game, then I would highly recommend this title.  Although there are a couple of issues which have made the game less enjoyable for me recently, on balance it is an excellent cricket simulator and Big Ant are a worthy studio who should be encouraged to continue their fine work - although this game is not perfect, my advice to the diehard cricket tragics is that Big Ant represents the best chance we will get to cricket perfection in the future.  I sincerely hope they continue developing cricket games in future years.\n\nFirstly, the positives.\n\nCricket is a very difficult and complex game in real life, and Don Bradman 14 has replicated this complexity in both batting and bowling.  Especially on the higher difficulty levels, concentration and timing are critical.  In batting, there is an excellent risk vs reward mechanism - it is possible to adopt a \"death or glory\" approach in a T20 match when fast runs are required, just as it is possible to build an innings in a test match with a more sober and judicious mindset.  When bowling, you will find that batsmen place a much greater value on their wicket in test matches - it is common (for me at least) to go many overs without a wicket, but when that breakthrough comes, it is tremendously satisfying.  Given that test matches can go for five days in real life, I think that Big Ant has done a good job of replicating this experience within the game.  Umpire decisions are imperfect, and it's possible to challenge a decision using DRS.  The vast majority of times, the umpire gets it right - but I have managed to challenge successfully a couple of decisions, and this has been a great thrill.\n\nTo sum up the positives - there is a real emphasis on gameplay, and this has been executed very well.  It's enough to justify the purchase of the game.  I may have experienced a few gripes along the way, but the core of the game is solid, and in my opinion, this is the most important thing.\n\nThe areas to be improved?\n\nWell, the graphics are fine, but not outstanding.  Having said that, they don't detract from the experience.  In-game sounds are fine but the commentary is insipid - hardly a gamebreaker, but something to be improved on in the future.  (I'm also a basketball fan, and the NBA2K franchise sets the standard for commentary as far as I'm concerned).  The one area I'm struggling with at the moment is the AI - I have found myself becoming increasingly more frustrated with this, particularly in short matches (ie: T20s).  In my recent experience, if my T20 team bats first, they win.  If they bat second, they lose.  Match simulations work well for the first innings, but the AI for run chases is just appalling.  It's so frustrating and disheartening when you bowl your guts out to restrict the batting team to a score of 100 to 120, only to find that your team falls ten runs short with 9 wickets in hand.  Running the simulation will never get them over the line - watching the rest of the team bat is almost torture.  (I remember a recent game when the two best batsmen in my T20 team needed 6 runs in the last over... they left three balls and hit the other three back to the bowler).  The AI running between the wickets is incredibly risk-averse (the only run-out I've ever seen in the game has been from when I was batting myself).  I'm about four years into my player's career at the moment, and these kinds of things are starting to make a big difference to my enjoyment of the game.\n\nThere is nothing I have said in the previous paragraph which has not been raised in the forums, and to give them credit, the Big Ant developers have been responsive to player concerns.

The upper difficulty levels are brutal, but not impossible.

I can't claim to be very good at anything in this game, but it feels very similar to my real-life cricketing abilities, so there's that.\n\nI've spend the majority of my time playing the career mode in this game.  It feels pretty realistic, except that with some of my performances, i'm sure my county should have left me out of some games.  \n\nIs the game perfect?  No.  The commentary is pretty inaccurate and repetitive.  There's a lot of missed catches for seemingly no reason.

I inexplicably missed the tutorial and had a lot of fun trying to figure out how to even bowl. I think I had about 10 dead balls in a row before I figured it out and even once I did, no balls were quite common until I finally got a hang of it. I haven't had much experience batting just yet, but the controls are really interesting. The fact that the batting arc is matched to the sticks on the gamepad makes for much easier shot selection. This is a game that requires a game pad, and it is worth buying one to play this.\n\nSo far, I have played mostly career mode and this really excites me. I love the idea of progressing your pro through the various ranks, and I believe this will be a key mode for any future incarnations.

I have been playing cricket games for as long as I can remember from Graham Gooch's cricket on the C64, Super International cricket on the SNES, most of the thoroughly excellent Brian Lara games, the complex cricket captain series, the hit and miss quality of the EA series and more recently the frustrating codemasters releases and Cricket Revolution. This game very clearly sets a new benchmark for cricket games.\n\nThe batting system is joyus. The game rewards you for reactions and punishes you for playing premeditated shots. You are forced to consider the implications of working the ball around the pitch for long term accumulation or pinch hitting for quick runs and the bowlers adapt to your style of batting and actively try and out think you.\n\nBowling is a great improvement on previous games where instead of selecting a spot on the pitch to hit, you focus on line and length and take wickets through variation and guile. Bowling the same ball over and over again is, like real cricket, an invitation for the batsman to score where as subtle variations on pace, spin/swing and bowling position as well as bowling to a plan gives wickets in a similar way to real life.\n\nThis game is highly polished in particular the in game implementation of the DRS system and the availability of reviews is fantastic. Graphics are clean and crisp although not without the occasional error or glitch. I have not encountered anything game breaking personally.\n\nThe career mode is probably where I will spend most of my time. In a similar way to the 'be a pro' mode in Fifa games you start as a green and eager 16 year old and work your way through your local team through to the international arena honing and developing your skills along the way. \n\n\nAnother major positive for me is the ability to mod the game with real player and team likenesses and the continued support by the developer to patch in functional and bug improvements. Currently the co-op mode is missing but this is to be patched in at a later time. I appreciate the effort to get the game to the market and it clearly has been designed and developed by people who love the game. Once co-op mode has been release I can see this becoming a very popular feature.\n\nIn short, if you are a cricket fan and you are sitting on the fence about this game then I can assure you there is enough here to keep you entertained. It plays more like cricket than any other game I have played.

As of this review, such issues are few and dont really bother too much.\n- Commentary can get boring fast.\n- Lack of \"Voice Chat / Typing Chat\" during multiplayer matches.

One thing I find very difficult in this game is the steep learning curve for batting and bowling. Bowling is probably a tad easier than batting since batting involves making all your decisions in mere seconds which includes footwork, line and length and direction all in 1 second. That being said does not necessarily mean that the batting is broken, on the contrary if your footwork, timing and shot selection is spot on you are in for something amazing. A lot of people do not understand why they find edges even after timing the ball perfectly and choosing the right shot selection, but they forget that the 3rd element in batting the direction of your feet when playing the shot. The only way to master the batting is time in the nets, and alot of it.\n\nOverall this game is by far the best cricket game, no cricket game before this come close and it is definately worth the money for cricket fans. Casual players will maybe get frustrated by the batting and bowling controls because of the complexity, but I love it, the game tends more to a simulation than being an arcade cricket game.

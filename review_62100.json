Tetromino puzzler mixed with music mixed with a bit of Qix.\n\nYou place tetrominos on a grid to try and create quads, blobs that cover up part of the grid. Ideally, you want to cover as much of the level as possible, make as many quads as possible, etc. It works similarly in some ways to the old Atari classic Rampart--minus the whole Army/Castle minigame stuff, of course.\n\nThe neat variation is that there is a beatline sweeping left to right across the grid, which plays a basic music track (and they're good--well known electronic artists like Moby and Philip Glass) but then layers elements into that track based on the position of your quads. So you might get an EDM track where vocal elements or percussion suddenly show up because you've created a quad in a new area. Pretty nifty.\n\nI'm sure some reviews will say it's zen-like but it really isn't... there's prety good pressure throghout the game to rush the tetromino placement, but the gaem does offer a 'free' mode to play around in as opposed to just the timed (3 min, 6min, 9min) modes.\n\nPleasant game, well worth the minimal time investment.", "timestamp_created": 1506280788, "timestamp_updated": 1506280788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34523300": {"recommendationid": "34523300", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990695056", "num_games_owned": 547, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 2734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499152714}, "language": "english", "review": "This is seriously good puzzling fun with great music.

But for a couple bucks, meh. It's not a bad game, it just has some...issues.\n\nThe concept is that you place pentaminos in an effort to make large quadrangles. Music is playing behind it and beat bar sweeps across the field. Different sections of the field, once covered by a quadrangle, respond to the passage of the beat bar by playing a portion of the music that had been previously muted. If you've ever worked with a DAW, then you have a rough sense of how this works.\n\nOf course, this means that in the beginning, almost none of the song is playing. By the end, if you've bothered to play, you'll likely hear most if not all of the song. This is great when the song is something worth listening to. The nature of the play though, lends itself best to repetitive electronica of some stripe, and that's what you get. The reason it lends itself to repetitive electronica is because repetitive electronica is extremely repetitive with gradual changes to a phrase you hope is more than eight bars long. \n\nThe repetition of repetitive is deliberate. If you found the repetition of repetitive grating, you'll also find it the repetition of the repetitive music grating.\n\nIf you play it more than once, the grating will also be repetitive.\n\nSome songs are worse than others. The Moby track is bad, but it isn't the worst. The best, of course, is \"Still Alive\", but this version of it is pretty stretched out even if you play the three minute version.\n\nYou can see everything this game has to offer in an hour or less. There are leaderboards, but like most leaderboards, may as well be considered set in stone, and probably involved and exploit of some sort.\n\nIf it had more than six levels, I'd play them once or twice, so I'm recommending it. Just don't expect a lot from it.\n\nTetris remains king of block placing games.

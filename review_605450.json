Il personaggio che ci troveremo a impersonare sar\u00e0 un arciere trovatosi in un purgatorio medievaleggiante che si rif\u00e0 fortemente all\u2019estetica di Dark Souls, l\u2019unica area presente nel gioco \u00e8 in particolare ispirata chiaramente alle zone gemelle della \u201cLost Bastille\u201d di Dark Souls II, proposta in una variante prevalentemente diurna dalla notevole direzione artistica. L\u2019estetica generale non \u00e8 il solo richiamo ai capolavori di From Software e In Death ci propone in aggiunta sia la classica nebbia pre-boss, sia una difficolt\u00e0 che tende con fierezza all\u2019hardcore.\n\nIniziata la nostra run e affiancati dal nostro arco dovremmo quindi procedere di punto in punto, cercando di sopravvivere agli agguati dei nemici o tentando di prenderli di soppiatto. La variet\u00e0 degli NPC non \u00e8 spaventosa, ma consci di quello che il titolo propone ad oggi \u00e8 sufficiente; avremo a che fare con monaci, maghi, guerrieri e zombie, ognuno con le proprie peculiarit\u00e0 ma generalmente non troppo svegli a livello di IA. Sar\u00e0 infatti abbastanza semplice fregare i nemici solitari e quelli in piccoli gruppi, lavorando di astuzia tra il proprio movimento e i limiti dell\u2019aggro nemico. Quando i gruppi si faranno pi\u00f9 consistenti, invece, sar\u00e0 possibile fare uso delle frecce magiche che troveremo sul nostro cammino o che potremo acquistare tramite le monete restituite dai nemici; a tal proposito i topoi del fantasy ci sono tutti, dalla freccia infuocata a quella di ghiaccio, da quella velenosa a quella multipla. Fino a qui In Death non pare nulla di nuovo o eccezionale, ma l\u2019insieme degli elementi rende il titolo di S\u00f2lfar un roguelike davvero soddisfacente, nonostante le attuali mancanze dovute alla natura EA del titolo.

It takes a while to get used to the bow because every game has to be different. This one requires a long draw and has pretty high velocity. It takes a moment when you draw it for it to reach full power, so you can't really shoot faster than two arrows per second, which I like. The shield is fun to block with, just takes some practice to make it more reflexive. It looks and sounds great.\n\nLocomotion is done by shooting a teleport arrow, which travels a much shorter distance than your regular arrow, or by throwing a shard an even shorter distance, or by slowly walking. I wish the walking speed was a bit faster in general and didn't slow you down when strafing or moving backwards. I think that's mostly for comfort reasons, so maybe it will get a bit more option.\n\nYou can't move while firing the bow, which I both like and dislike. I like that it makes me use all my roomscale space for dodging instead, but when I'm creeping around a corner it'd be much nicer to be able to do it with bow drawn. Enemies are fairly slow to react when they initially spot you so it's easy to run away if you turn a corner and find a big crowd.\n\nThe battles in this are a lot of fun. You have to juggle multiple enemies and balance the risk of going for the quick headshot kills with keeping them staggered as you rotate through the archers in the back taking shots while knights charge at you. The special arrows add some extra coolness. When you toggle between them the game goes in to slow motion, so it's possible to change them mid combat.\n\nThe levels are sort of procedural, but it's more like the same layouts of multiple buildings, but in a different order. I did just see one new layout, but It'd be nice to have a little more variety.\n\nI made it to the boss on the second run, and make it there about half the time since, but haven't killed him yet. It's a fun fight.\n\nSo mostly a positive experience. I wish the sliding locomotion wasn't as constrained, a bit more variety in the levels, and for enemies to spawn in a bit sooner. If you teleport too far, in to a seemingly empty area, you might find yourself surrounded when everything spawns.

The controls in this game are great.  A very interesting take on teleporting, which becomes nearly second nature by your third or fourth game.  Locomotion is still experimental, and one of my biggest gripes are that it's dreadfully slow.  There's no way to speed up either, so it will always end up being a combo of teleporting and locomotion in tight rooms.\n\nThe progression is nice for the first couple hours.  By now I've unlocked a good portion of the game's achievements, which also serve as marks of progression.  As the achievements are unlocked, enemies become upgraded and spawn more frequently, and different weapons/tools get added to the game.  The blocking mechanic is also surprisingly well-done, and very, very helpful.\n\nThe game is definitely in early access, so if you're looking for a full game you may want to look elsewhere.  That being said, I still believe this game is excellent for the price in its current state.  It's addictive, challenging, and makes your arms hurt like hell.  But you can't stop.

The afterlife theme mixed with medieval architecture and baddies was very well done.\nAlthough the game is a Rogue-like it offers progression through achievements which when completed add something to gameplay, sometimes its something that helps and sometimes something that hurts. It could be a new harder version of preexisting a bad guy, it could be a new arrow type, it could add a damage bonus to headshots, and so on. As I played and got better I advanced further with each new life, finding new areas and developing new tactics.\nThe bow mechanics are the best I have seen in VR yet and switching arrow types on the fly is easy and because bringing up the arrow type switching mechanic slows down time it becomes a very helpful tool to use in tough situations allowing you to dodge arrows easier and make more calculated battle decisions.\nThe locomotion used is also very well done, allowing you to move in 3 different ways that were each useful in different ways. You have a teleportation arrow that when shot will teleport you to whereever it strikes, this is best used for moving longer distance. You also have an orb that you can toss quickly for short to medium range teleportation, best used to quickly get out of a bad situation or to simply move behind cover without having to turn towards where you want to go. You can nock an arrow while your teleportation device is still en route to its destination and thus arrive ready to strike. The third form of locomotion is the touchpad which is very useful for poking out around corners or making small adjustments but is pretty slow so it isn't great for retreating or doing a tactical retreat luring baddies into an ambush in a spot of your choosing.\nOverall I would give In Death an 8.5/10 and I have had a lot of fun playing it so far and although I am yet to beat it but it has a surprising amount of replay value and keeps bringing me back to it.\nI look forward to what they will do with it while it is still in Early Access, In my opinion some things that they should do to make it even better would be:\n*Add a melee weapon, maybe even just a knife so as not to take the focus away from ranged combat but to just give you something to use in a pinch.\n* Difficulty levels. Having an Easy, Normal, and Hard difficulty setting would be a great way to add more replayability to the game as more experienced or better players try to master Hard difficulty and newer or worse players get to possibly beat the game on easy if they are unable to on Normal.\n* A few more enemy types.\n*Co-op play. I feel like this would be amazing and would really expand the audience and add replayability.\n*Level Creator. I know this is a stretch but it would be so cool.\n* More Statistics. I think more in depth statistics for each round and also tracking your all time statistics would be really cool.\n*More achievements. People love achievements. In this case it is the only real way of making lasting \"progress\" in the game and more achievements means people would play more.\n*More Bosses. I have only beat one boss so far because I have only had it for a couple days but I think it would make things less repetitive. Even just mini bosses with a few minions that are just a little more difficult than normal baddies and would take some strategy to defear.\n*More things you can buy. Also if you could buy 1 health per shop, although that might make it too easy.\nObviously this is just a wish list and I don't expect many if any of these to be fulfilled. I think someday soon VR games will get to that level but not quite yet but this game is definitely a step in the right direction.", "timestamp_created": 1517927204, "timestamp_updated": 1517927204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39881489": {"recommendationid": "39881489", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984077160", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 74, "last_played": 1520675475}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is a blast.", "timestamp_created": 1517896081, "timestamp_updated": 1517896081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39881257": {"recommendationid": "39881257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067774915", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517894124}, "language": "english", "review": "To start with, I own a first generation HTC VIVE running on an i5 4950k and gtx 1060.

While the game is a roguelike and has decent mechanics, the experience gets repetitive pretty fast. Enemy types aren't super varied and the environments are fairly bland.

Arrow variation is pretty good, but I just want more combat options. I get that this is a bow and arrow roguelike, but it really needs something more - even the most basic of melee systems would be a huge help. Being swarmed by 6 + enemies in a boss room often doesn't leave a lot of room for manuevering, and hitting every enemy in sight with your bow fast enough isn't often feasible, and so you die bloodied in a corner.

Besiegt man Gegner, erh\u00e4lt man Gold und teilweise bessere Pfeile (Frost, Feuer, Nadeln...). Sobald man stirbt, wird das Level neu generiert und man f\u00e4ngt von vorn an.\nKlingt bl\u00f6d?\nIsses aber nicht!\n\nIm Grunde spielt Fortschritt im Level eher eine untergeordnete Rolle, denn es kommt nach der HighScore Liste nur darauf an, wer in einem Zug am weitesten kam.

Klingt auch doof?\nIsses aber nicht!\n\nDadurch, dass man alles mit dem Bogen erledigt, bzw. durch das Werfen einen gewissen Flow reinbkommt, f\u00fchlt sich In Death in Kombination mit der Fantasywelt, die im Himmel herumschwebt trotzdem cool an und man kann sich am ehesten in das Szenario hineinversetzen.

The setting and theme work well.\n\nAt the time when I tested it, it had a fairly curious learning curve, at some points getting intensely frustrating.\n\nBut the beauty is that the core mechanics are so well crafted, so rewarding that the game will pull you back in despite the frustration, and you will get better, and in doing so, reap the rewards of a hard fought victory.\n\nI actually nearly gave up on the game immediately before they had implemented the free locomotion mechanic - the bow teleport and the shard throw aren't bad... but they take away from the sort of immediacy and reliability of normal teleportation mechanics and exacerbate a difficult game.\n\nBut, I came back due to the keen presentation... and eventually learned to love the bow and shard teleport mechanics - it's really quite unique, with both of them been among my favourite supplementary locomotion techniques in VR to date! \n\nThe weight and feeling of the shard throw (which I call the dagger teleport; because that's what it feels like you're throwing) is just one of the most tactile experiences that VR currently offers... because a dagger is about the weight of a vive controller. A subtle variation in the flick of the wrist will cause you to teleport in a dramatically different location - and once you learn to feel it out, becomes an awesome sensation; as you casually flick around corners, doors, archways and down the corridor, while also shooting zombies (abominations), hooded death monks and knights in their damn faces!\n\nWith more games of this quality level, VR will be sure to become the dominant medium of gaming in the years to come.\n\nIf you're at all a fan of the bow shooting or the rogue lite genres, do yourself a favour and pick this one up.\n\nThoroughly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1517655792, "timestamp_updated": 1517655883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39811814": {"recommendationid": "39811814", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974673688", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517953082}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me start by saying I was a beta tester and got the game for free when it released to early access.\n\nThe gameplay has really been polished. It's hard, but a few hours in and you'll be loading arrows and firing without barely looking at the bow. It demands a level of focus and coordination that few VR games do, this becomes especially apparent after your first few deaths. Just to load the arrows you need to be relatively closer to the bow string than most games with a bow. The enemies are a joy to take down and the placement is generated from a seed each session.\n\nThe only thing in my mind that is holding it back is the lack of level variety, 14 hours in and I'd like some new sights as I take on tougher versions of knights, archers, and monsters with new types of arrows. The achievement based progress system is very nice, especially your first 5-6 hours in as you see your abilities and options grow, but at the same time new tougher enemies are unlocked. Perhaps the game could use a few more enemies too.\n\nI think this is one of the few VR games where I feel like it's system is all in place and polished, it just needs more variety in levels/environment. Once they've added that in and new bosses then you'll see people putting 40+ hours into this game. I don't want to hype things beyond your imagination, it currently has one boss and about 5 different layouts to it's gothic architecture themed levels so not quiet as procedurally generated on that front. There are about 10 special types of arrows, and 3 types of enemies with several variations you can unlock as you play. It has both teleport and joypad/stick locomotion, and it's done right. Right now it's very score focused, but that'll certainly change as new content and challenges are added so a stronger story element is there for those that need it. The replayability is already there and is only going to grow.\n\n14 hours in with a wealth of special arrows unlocked, rushing into a room and blasting away can still get me easily killed. I'm not saying I haven't done so and survived, but it's the kind of thing that will deplete your arrow supply and leave you taking on the boss in the worse condition.\n\nI'm not going to say whether the game is worth the price our not, after all I got it for free, but I think the game represents what many of us would like to see more of in our VR games.

I like VR archery games and have quite a few hours in QuiVR, Holopoint, and Twisted Arrow. After 3 runs I must say In Death well deserves attention of anyone who enjoys VR bow games. \n\nThe game looks gorgeous. Environments are beautiful, enemies look detailed and realistic, the music score is excellent as well. This is likely the most polished Early Access game I\u2019ve played yet. \n\nThe game uses procedural maps to give you a new map each run which certainly helps replayability. After death you earn achievements which both improve your abilities and make enemies stronger to maintain a great challenge. This is one leaderboard I want to climb on for sure. \n\nYou can find or buy special arrows that set enemies on fire/freeze them/shoot multiple arrows and such. You can block arrow shots/melee hits with a shield. I\u2019d love to see a shortsword added for when an enemy gets in your face. \n\nI generally am not a fan of teleport games and much prefer artificial locomotion. The good news is artificial locomotion is available in the settings and works well enough though it\u2019s s bit slow for my taste for game balance reasons I imagine. For my first run I went ahead and tried the default movement scheme to experience the game the way developers intended. After 5 minutes I was very comfortable with it and after 10 it felt like second nature. The way it works is when you pull on your bowstring with trigger you shoot a regular arrow as you\u2019d expect. When you pull on the bowstring with touchpad (on your non-bow hand) you instead shoot a teleport arrow. It\u2019s extremely fluid and works well. If you press the non-bow hand touchpad away from the bowstring you can throw a teleport dagger instead. If you turn on artificial movement you keep both teleport abilities so you can combine all 3 to your heart\u2019s content.

So I checked out some videos and guides and my interest peaked enough to try it.\n\nAnd glad I did! \n\nThe pace feels just right, the team must have put some love and care into this. Archery mechanics are spot on. Going into the fray you have complete control for each and all fights with the 'bullet time' ability, meaning for VR you can go into it guns blazing or take your time safely picking them off looking around corners. When you shoot an enemey the arrow sticks into them and they recoil in a different way depending on where you hit them. Making for interesting combat as you can slow 'em down long enough to switch targets momentarily. \n\nAlso most importantly for me the AI moves and paths correctly, moving organically and idling/patroling nicely. I found with other archery games I become immediately disconnected when the minions clip incorrectly on the level or bug out or are just too obviously stupid to keep me interested. \n\nGraphics are nice, Gothic setting is what sold me into trying it and does not disappoint.\n\nSound effects are fantastic, arrows wizz past your ear, emenies make different noises so you can safely identify if one has appeared in your area. Gregorian style music plays in the background, amplifying the presense of a haunted Cathederal.\n\nGold is earnt by picking off enemies, you can spend it on shops that divide the three zones before the boss. Items and achievements keep it interesting as they grant permanent buffs as well as poweful consumables. \n\nBefore playing this or If your on the fence read this Guide!:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1288050163\n\nAnd the advanced guide (not required):\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1288069185\n\nThings I would like:\n\n- More interesting Gothic worlds (Think Vermintide - fantastic example of immersive level design)\n- Maybe some more loot (such as hidden gold chests)\n- Multiplayer!", "timestamp_created": 1517573368, "timestamp_updated": 1517573368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39788899": {"recommendationid": "39788899", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995941131", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517572662}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid game!", "timestamp_created": 1517572687, "timestamp_updated": 1517572687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39788477": {"recommendationid": "39788477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063942102", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 165, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519687557}, "language": "english", "review": "loving it so far.

Was einfach klingt entpuppt sich als nervenaufreibende Herausforderung.\nNach einem kurzen Tutorial werden wir auch schon in ein zuf\u00e4llig generiertes Dungeon geworfen. Bewaffnet mit Bogen und Schild k\u00e4mpfen wir uns langsam gegen verschiedene Gegnertypen vorran. W\u00e4hrend zu Beginn noch langsame \"Zombies\" auf uns zuwanken und M\u00f6nche uns vereinzelt beschie\u00dfen, steigt der Schwierigkeitsgrad mit jedem Meter. Im weiteren Verlauf bekommen wir es mit gepanzerten Rittern und Bogensch\u00fctzen mit Mehrfachpfeilen und anderem zu tun. \nW\u00e4hrend unserer Tour sammeln wir flei\u00dfig Gold und Loot von erledigten Gegnern ein, um uns auf den Endkampf vorzubereiten. Durch das Freischalten von Erfolgen verst\u00e4rken wir unseren Helden zus\u00e4tzlich, wie z.B. mehr Schaden bei Kopftreffern und \u00e4hnliches.\nF\u00fcr unser Gold k\u00f6nnen wir uns sowohl heilen (angebracht, da man nur 1 Leben besitzt, Permadeath) und uns mit Spezialpfeilen ausr\u00fcsten, die Gegner in Brand setzten, einfrieren, explodieren uvm.\nZur Fortbewegung dient sowohl ein Teleportationspfeil als auch freie Bewegung. Per Teleportationspfeilen k\u00f6nnen wir uns \u00fcber D\u00e4cher bewegen oder schnell einer \u00dcberzahl Gegnern entkommen. Zum Blocken herannahender Pfeile wechseln wir per schnellem Tastendruck auf unser Schild oder werfen einen Miniblitz, um uns aus der direkten Schu\u00dflinie zu porten.. Nahkampf ist nicht vorgesehen, also immer sch\u00f6n Abstand halten.\nDas Wechseln der Pfeile erfolgt ebenfalls \u00fcber einen einfachen Knopfdruck und geht mit etwas \u00dcbung grandios. Allgemein ist die Steuerung ein gro\u00dfes Plus des Spiels. Sowohl das Zielen mit dem Bogen als auch das Wechseln der Pfeile und der schnelle Einsatz des Schildes zum Blocken funktionieren einwandfrei.\nAbwechslung ist dank der zuf\u00e4llig generierten Welt gegeben, und auch wenn das Spielprinzip simpel klingt, denkt man sich nach jeder Runde, ach komm, 1x geht noch. Das Spiel ist zwar nicht einfach, aber man hat immer das Gef\u00fchl, selbst Mist gebaut zu haben, wenn man stirbt. Es wirkt nicht \"unfair\", aber fordernd.\nUnsere Leistung k\u00f6nnen wir anhand eines Scoreboards mit dem Rest der Welt vergleichen,\nDie Grafik macht einen guten Eindruck, es l\u00e4uft permanent sehr fl\u00fcssig, hat keinerlei Aussetzer oder Spielabbr\u00fcche.\nDie Steuerung ist einfach nur gut und durchdacht, da gibt es nichts zu bem\u00e4ngeln.\nAuf jeden Fall eine runde Spielerfahrung die Lust auf mehr macht.\n\nGru\u00df Ziffi\n\nZiffi\u00b4s Spieletipps als Kurator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/5837414/", "timestamp_created": 1517565987, "timestamp_updated": 1517576933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.689737", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39786269": {"recommendationid": "39786269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001181233", "num_games_owned": 505, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516538490}, "language": "english", "review": "I own pretty much every credible SteamVR archery game on the market at the moment and always find something to enjoy in any of them, so the idea of an archery roguelike was very compelling.

We finally have a game with decent progression and replay value that has been built for VR!  This is essentially a dungeon crawler with procedurally generated levels.

While the game does center around teleportation, smooth movement is offered as well and you will actually find yourself barely using it.   The graphical quality has been optimized quite nicely and the atmosphere of the art style really reals you in.  My only real complaint for this game is the lack of throwing knives.

I revoked the Steam key and purchased the Early Access version so my review would count in Steam rankings.\n\nReview:\n \nI normally don't post reviews, but the quality of this game deserves it.  I have a modest VR library (50 or so titles) with an FPS bias.  I've spent far more hours playing In Death than any other title I own  ...  and that's just the beta version.  In my view, the gameplay is already mostly perfected and all that is needed is level content.  \n\nPros:\n- Addictive gameplay.  You're an archer in the afterlife and everything wants to kill you.  Bring it!  The bow and arrow mechanics are well tuned, and your survival is tied directly to your skill, not luck.  Teleportation and free locomotion movement plus the fact that you can go anywhere that you can see creates endless options for tactical combat ranging from Super Cautious Long Distance Sniper to In Your Face Ninja Assassin.  Randomly generated interconnected floating islands populated with gothic architecture provides a great arena for afterlife mayhem.  Fact:  taking down enemies with perfect face shots never gets old.\n\n- Unique setting, superb graphics, immersive sound design.  Floating islands of gothic architecture is just cool.  Enemies (monks, knights, abominations) are detailed and superbly animated.  The music helps establish the surreal atmosphere, while the sound effects are excellent.  The meaty thunk of a head shot is a beautiful thing.\n\n- Channels the Dark Souls Mojo like nobody's business. This game is (really) hard, but fair. Be prepared to die, a lot. Enemies scale in difficulty as you play via an achievement system which moves the challenge bar upwards. However, the game never feels unfair and it manages to trigger the \"must try just one more time\" urge with impressive consistency.          \n\nCons\n- As one might expect from an early access title, there is somewhat limited content. You can proceed through an apparently infinite number of randomly generated levels, but at this point, there is a strong similarity between levels.  However, prepare to spend a significant amount of time building the skills necessary to just finish the first level.\n  \n- No multiplayer yet\n\n- The bow is your only weapon that can take down enemies (you also have a shield that can block arrows and bash opponents backwards).  Personally, I'd like to see a melee weapon added eventually.\n\nBottom line:  I've had a blast so far with In Death, the price provides excellent value for the money, and I really can't wait to see

The level rebuilds itself differently along with enemies after each death / run. As you progress through the game and get \"achievements\" you receive permanent upgrades (some \"downgrades\" too such as tougher enemies). As a VR game it plays really well unlike many of the games released for VR. The movement system involves either shooting a teleport arrow to where you wish to go, or throwing a shard for short ranged movement. At first I thought this was an odd concept but when I played the game it felt right. You also can buy items at shops that are also randomly generated. As for the enemies, they all have their own abilities and need to be approached differently (some enemies attack from afar, some charge at you, etc.) The changes I've seen the game go through before it's early access release (I was in the closed test) makes me confident this game will be even greater when it leaves early access, I recommend this game especially if you are looking for a good roguelike game made for VR.", "timestamp_created": 1517529697, "timestamp_updated": 1517529697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39778960": {"recommendationid": "39778960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049244312", "num_games_owned": 298, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516005157}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game.

I bring up some pros and cons after 35 minutes of playing.\n\nPros\n- nice music, creating the perfect mood, and atmosphere for this kind of game\n- randomly placed play areas make it more interesting and not so repeating\n- graphics are nice but definitely could be better\n- bow mechanics are nice and easy, works well and feels well. Different arrow types is a nice touch.\n- free locomotion is must be and you have it here\n\nCons\n\n- why and why no graphical settings? Why no supersampling settings? It should be must be because some people have very powerful pc-s as mine and I want to tweaks SS or something As generally, graphics look nice, its far from very good because there is some degree blurriness and I dont like it. It should be nice and clear as lots of games are. Please make it, so I can crank it up as high as possible.\n- it feels somehow repetitive because there are very similar buildings and rooms and only 3 different type of enemies so far. Maybe I didn't play long enough, will see.\n- the AI does not seem very good, but it's not bad either. Should be better!\n\nSo far, generally positive game but hope to see more and graphical tweakings possibility and more content. It seems to be high-quality game what it has already.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1517522935, "timestamp_updated": 1517522935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634307", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1517524076, "developer_response": "There is a way to tweak graphic settings through an ini file, but we will expose this in an in-game menu soon.

There is a setting for sliding locomotion as well.\n\nYour only weapon is a bow & arrow, but you\u2019ll gain specialty arrows as you progress. For blocking attacks you can quickly activate your shield with your bow hand by holding down trigger, after you release the trigger your bow returns.\n\nEach time you play the levels are procedurally generated so you\u2019ll never play the same level twice. \n\nThe overall design is beautiful. The level architecture is a giant cathedral, with Gregorian chant music to match. And speaking of audio, the sound design is also very well done. The game doesn\u2019t blast you with constant audio, you can listen in and hear if an enemy is around the corner, or if an arrow narrowly misses you.\n\nThe whole experience is exceptionally well polished and challenging.

There's a long way to go, which I'm pretty stoked for, and in this early state, it's like using 2x $1200 turntables and a $25 dollar Numark mixer you found at Goodwill. \n\nThe space feels good and legit on my Oculus Touch. The ability to raise and lower the table is the best. The decks feel good and strong with a nice wind-up. Not perfect, though. Doesn't feel like there's a lot of \"snap\". Seems as if I can't hold the record in place and let it slip. When I let go, I want an almost instant response, but it feels as if it always winds up a little bit. Still I was able to match, using the double-eared cue. If I started out of time, I was able to shove the turntable forward or back, with some practice. When attempting to touch-slow the turntable, I would sometimes grab the record, which was frustrating but probably just user inaccuracy. \n\nI really wish there was a crossfader slope knob. Right now it seems that it's set in a solid 50%, which is perfect for graceful mixing, but I always used my crossfader in a more sharp form, for scratching, and I would even go hamster style at times. I also wish the mixer had some effects on it. EQs are fun, but I also want a nice resonate lowpass filter, or a phaser. It was a little hard for me to differentiate between the cue track and the master track. It would be awesome if you could change the tone of the cue, so you could really hear the difference in the two, or maybe even mix the master channel out of the cue, so it's more audible. That being said, the current mixer is pretty awesome and is perfect for beginners, but I hope that in the future you can swap your gear to a more advanced mixer.\n\nI liked how you could see the record grooves. Helps you cue. I also like how I couldn't accidentally whack my tonearm during a backspin (no trainwrecks here, people). The record box worked perfectly for me, and by perfectly I mean that I was standing in a pool of records by the end of my 1 hour session. I did discover that you can just put the records away for less clutter, but dude. It's VR, throw it across the room :D\n\nI hope that in the future you can have more gear models, maybe even CDJs emulated, and a four channel mixer. Great freakin' job though, I'm excited to follow development of this and will by happy to continue playing around with it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1514420933, "timestamp_updated": 1514420933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38646632": {"recommendationid": "38646632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122351494", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515181758}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm very sorry to give the first negative feedback, but it's only becuase, as a DJ myself, there were a few things that ruined the experience for me, that if fixed, would change this review in an instant.

The trim and master would effect what the audience hears, so the cue needs to be sorted to work as normal decks.\n\n*I found that with the Oculus controllers the sensitivity was too high, it took ages to get the specific pitch required in the tutorial.  I managed to beat match some old hard house that I have, but more technical tracks are a chore.\n\n*Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't figure out how to reset my position in game, a reset button would be great.\n\n*It would be great to be able to twist all the knobs from minus to max in one turn, any DJ will say that time is very important, you don't want to be having to let go and turn again when trying to mix. \n\n*One final less important point is, more scenes would be awesome.\n\nThese are my points I wanted to raise, please only take this as constructive, I really do like the app, but with these points sorted I could really have a lot of fun with this!\n\nThanks a lot!", "timestamp_created": 1514180212, "timestamp_updated": 1515784432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519126", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38643505": {"recommendationid": "38643505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009876564", "num_games_owned": 592, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 673, "last_played": 1516243257}, "language": "english", "review": "WOAW!

It took a while to learn but I had great fun doing it, even if I couldn't afford such a set myself. \n\nEventually I bought a MIDI controller and DJ software to mix my own music at home, but it was never quite the same. Other hobbies took over, I forgot all about the joy of DJ'ing and many years passed.\n\nUntil recently, when I was looking for interesting VR apps that I could try out with the Oculus Rift. When I started up Vinyl Reality, all those good memories came back to me. And the app is not just a toy, it really is practical enough for doing mixsets the good old fashioned way, back then when your gear wouldn't count BPM's for you and you had to prepare for your sets and spend minutes tweaking the perfect sync between two records. And I find myself forgetting that I'm in VR. The turntables feel the same way. The mixer feels the same way. All those old tricks still work. Sure, with a little less tactile precision, that comes with the virtual nature of the app, but seriously, I'm so excited to own turntables and mix tracks again, I don't care. :)\n\nWith the recent 1.0.3 update, the grooves on the records now show the actual track structure, just like you would expect in real life, and with that, the basic app (without bells and whistles) is complete. Nevertheless, the developer has a lot of future features in store, some of which will bring a bit more modernity into the affair, others will just add flair, like new virtual locations to mix at.\n\nAll in all, 10/10.

I don't make music or anything  i'm a complete noob when it comes to these things.\n\nVinyl Reality is a Simulator in which you can use DJ equippment to mix/create your own songs and even record them.\nFor me as a non-DJ the controls where intuitive and easy to understand. The tutorial gives you a good enough overview to get you started.\n\nThe game uses songs that are on your computer so you can mix your favorite titles or your own music aswell. There is a decent amount of sliders and buttons to fiddle with to customize your track.\n\nI personally don't know how accurate this simulator is, since i never stood behind a turntable myself, but i know that i had fun with this and even managed to do a little remix of song myself (probably not a good one but what can you do ;) )\n\nIf you're a DJ, i can't tell you if this is good or not, but from a noob's perspective i can say: It's a fun little piece of Software and i can imagin a pro could maybe do a Twitch livestream concert for example, mixing his own tracks and stuff.

Man findet eigentlich alles da wo es auch sein sollte. Ich habe keine Ruckler beim Mixen entdecken k\u00f6nnen. Ich bin seither fasziniert von dieser Software. Es zeigt die M\u00f6glichkeiten einmal auf eine andere Sichtweise, welche VR in Zukunft bieten k\u00f6nnte. Es macht Spa\u00df die virtuellen Fader zu bewegen, die Plattensammlung auf die Teller zu legen und f\u00fcr eine Lange Zeit in die Musik ganz einzutauchen. Man vergisst sehr schnell, dass man sich vor einem Virtuellen Dj- Pult befindet. Ich m\u00f6chte nachfolgend noch auf gewisses Potenzial hinweisen und ebenfalls auf diverse mankos welche der Entwickler ver\u00e4ndern / verbessern k\u00f6nnte.\n\nPontenzial:\n\nVirtuelle Clubs, mit tanzenden Menschen und dazu die passende Light show, die dann aber hoffentlich ebenfalls der realit\u00e4t sehr nahe kommen. Aus anderen Apps dieser Art, scheiterten die Entwickler an der Animierung diverser Moving Lights, Laser etc. Das sah alles sehr billig aus und man bemerkte, dass die Programmierung einfach keine Experten dieser Art waren. Bei dieser App hier, bemerkt man sehr stark, dass hier auch Musiker und Techniker bei der Entwicklung beteiligt sind. Die Detailtreue zu den Technics 1210er und dessen Bedienung ist einfach genial gelungen.\n\nDer Mixer ist zwar insofern funktional, jedoch vermisse ich pers\u00f6nlich etwas mehr Modernit\u00e4t mit mehr Funktionen wie. z.B Kill switches, Master Equalizer, Compressoren, Effekte, mehr Kan\u00e4le etc.\n\nF\u00fcr mehr variablen m\u00fcssten den Decks auch noch zwei CD Player intigriert werden, da nicht mehr alle DJs mit Vinyl auflegen, was ich pers\u00f6nlich zwar sehr bedauere, aber ich aufgeschlossen gegen alles bin. Dadurch k\u00f6nnte einfach eine gr\u00f6\u00dfere Zielgruppe angesprochen werden.\n\nEs fehlt momentan auch noch eine M\u00f6glichkeit den Raum in dem man Mixt an seine Bed\u00fcrfnisse anzupassen wie z.b wo das Pult steht Oder wie Hoch das Pult gebaut ist. Nicht jeder nutzer hat einen solch gro\u00dfen Spielbereich zur Verf\u00fcgung. Vielleicht habe ich auch solch eine Funktion auch nur \u00fcbersehen. \n\nDie Ganzen Sets aufzunehmen funktioniert ganz gut,aufgenommen wird als WAV, jedoch ist mir aufgefallen, dass zwischen CUE und MASTER ein geh\u00f6riges Delay existiert. Dies ist zwar im Club auch so, jedoch sind daf\u00fcr ja Monitore am Pult. Es ist nervig das Delay im Vorraus mit einzuplanen. Das tr\u00fcbt das Erlebniss ein wenig. Ich denke das es evtl. an den Treibern liegt, die das Headset mit Ton befeuern.Ich werde dies aber nochmal mit meiner ASIO Karte testen.\nIch selbst nutze eine Oculus Rift.\n\nAuch vermisse ich es mehr als nur einen Plattenkoffer am Tisch stehen zu haben, da man ansonsten zu lange braucht um auch mal Tracks heraus zu suchen die nicht innerhalb einer Ordnerstruktur zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen. Dies w\u00fcrde es dann nicht vorrauszusetzen, sich die entsprechenden Tracks vorher in einem Ordner zu organisieren. \n\nPotenzial Multiplayer\nDas ergebe die M\u00f6glichkeiten Back TO Back zu spielen mit etfernten Kollegen welche nicht im gleichen Raum/Platz/Ort sind. Vermutlich w\u00e4re das enstehende Delay \u00fcber das Internet aber nicht zu h\u00e4ndeln, daher wahrscheinlich eher nur ein Wunschtraum.\n\nIm Moment gibt es nur eine einzige Umgebung in einem Dachgeschosszimmer mit Couch, Parkettboden und DJ Pult. Diese Umgebung ist ansich gelungen, aber hier sollte schnell nachgereicht werden.\nUmgebungen wie z.B\n\nFestivals\nClubs\nBeach Partys\n\nsind denkbar und bieten genug Abwechslung. \n\nIch habe die Software im Early Access erworben und habe daf\u00fcr knapp 13 \u20ac bezahlt.\nDas ist f\u00fcr den jetzigen Stand der Software in Ordnung. Wenn die Entwicklier hier schnell nachschieben, sollte der Preis angehoben werden, da meiner Meinung nach dies endlich mal eine von wenigen VR Erlebnissen bietet, welche man sich in Zukunft wirklich w\u00fcnscht. \u00dcber den Stand einer Technikdemo ist diese Software aber gl\u00fccklicherweise hinaus.", "timestamp_created": 1511103984, "timestamp_updated": 1511105023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629630", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36623791": {"recommendationid": "36623791", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999119601", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513458175}, "language": "english", "review": "Sayin the same.\n\nThere's nothing amiss here, aside the crowds you'd hope were there when your getting off on one during a fantastic mix session.\n\nThe scale of everything is clear and well defined, no problems twisting the dials.

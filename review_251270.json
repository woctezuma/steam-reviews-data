Story/gameplay-wise I thought it was awful. Got to the start of chapter 3 and it just knows one story beat the whole time. The characters I thought were generally unlikable, not because their flaws and quirks are bothersome but because I can only listen to Japanese schoolgirls crying, puking and fighting for so long before I roll my eyes and hit Alt-F4. Horror needs some tonal variety to keep things believable and enjoyable. This game does TRY to do it, but it just doesn't land the emotional beats the way it wants to. Also, the savepoints are assinine. Nobody wants to replay long sections of dialogue and exploration in a horror game once they know what they're going to find, but if you die in certain areas your last save point will have been a LONG way behind you. On that note, there's a point at which an enemy kills by touching you... but you have no reason to believe this will be the case, because previous encounters only punished you for \"looking into his eyes.\" In hindsite I guess it's obvious enough, but at the time I was infurated and it felt like poor tutorialisation. Deffinately avoid this one.

What I didn't know is that this is a port of the original PC version, not the PSP one, so the voice acting is sporadic, the character portraits are kind of ugly, and there are none of the infamous death illustrations from the PSP/ Vita/ 3DS versions. \n\nSo even though this isn't the most \"complete\" version of the game, it doesn't really matter, because as someone who knew the setup (high school friends perform a friendship ritual at the behest of their class representative, then are transported to the Heavenly Host elementary school, a hellish other world filled with terrible ways to die), I thought the story and atmosphere more than made up for it. Even though there are no illustrated scenes of gore, the game is still extremely disturbing, filled with great sound effects and nasty descriptions. The plot is also intriguing as hell in that uniquely Japanese way, and there are some great revelations as the game goes on. Without giving too much away, there's a whole mythology at play here, and it's both very cool and very scary. Aiding the atmosphere and plot is a top notch soundtrack, with one track in particular near the end standing out to me.\n\nThis game is legendary for a reason.

As such, the art styles are generally different from what we are generally accustomed to (that is, the BloodCovered: Repeated Fear version). Now with that out of the way, let's get on with the review itself.\n\n\nStoryline:\nThere is not a lot that I can reveal without spoiling the story too much, but it is about a group of high school students who decides to perform a ritual after their school's cultural festival, and got trapped in another variant of the school they were in before being transported (a haunted elementary school).\n\nGameplay:\nIt is a survival horror games where you take charge of 9 different characters throughout the chapters. The main goal is to escape, and in doing so, players must interact with documents, the environment, other characters and corpses to assist them by providing information.\nControls are pretty simple, you use W, A, S, D keys to move up, left, right, down respectively and spacebar to interact with everything else. If you decide to skip out the storyline, then just hold down 'Esc'.\n\nPros:\n+ Perverted Jokes\n+ Can butter up your pooper\n+ It definitely gives you the thrill and the scariness factor is there.\n+ Great puzzles and awersome Voice Acting (albeit it is only for a portion of the scenes).\n+ Interactive - Voice and Echoes flicker, and music reacts when there is a corpse nearby or just goes complete silent, which honestly, freaks me out the most.\n\nCons:\n- Voice acting is only for some scenes.\n- There are omitted and deleted cutscenes.\n- Some death scenes only show a black screen, with no visuals but only text to describe the situation.\n- Older art style, which some may not like/prefer. It does take some time to get used to it.\n\n\nVerdict: Butter up my pooper/10\n\nJokes aside, yeah, you should definitely get it. But if you do want a better experience (in terms of extra scenes, visuals and more voice acting, and better artwork) then do not hesitate to get the BloodCovered: Repeated Fear version available on the PSP/iOS and the 3DS.\nAlso do check out the sequels Book of Shadows and Blood Drive.

This provides ton of replay value\n-Soundtrack with good songs\nCons:\n-Although this is a remake with new features I would have prefered that they port over the amazing 2011 remake that truly defines Corpse Party.\n-Bad AI for enemies. They constantly get stuck on walls and other objects. I wish it was more challanging\nFinal thoughts. \n~\nThe game is good but I reccomend you find a cheap Playstation Vita/ 3DS to the play the new Corpse Party.

Yeah, Corpse Party is my favorite game. I'll explain why.\n\nIt is a horror RPG type game. Its best features are its narrative and its characters, which are at an incredible level, but we'll talk about that later. First I will explain the story about how Corpse Party was created and its different versions. It all started in 1998, when Makoto Kedouin creates the indie horror game [b]CORPSE-PARTY[/b] for PC. This game received a fan remake called [b]CORPSE PARTY -Rebuilt-[/b], which had art redone. Years later, CORPSE-PARTY receives a remake by Team GrisGris (formed by the same Makoto Kedouin) called [b]Corpse Party: BloodCovered[/b] and just Corpse Party in the West. This remake had the plot redone, completely new graphics, new music and indie voice actors (pretty good from my point of view). Corpse Party: BloodCovered was released from 2008 to 2011, because it was created by chapters. This remake caught the attention of 5pb, a well-known publisher in Japan, and formed an agreement with TeamGrisGris to launch the game on PSP and remaster it with new art, music and professional voice actors. The PSP version, called [b]Corpse Party: BloodCovered ... Repeated Fear[/b] and only Corpse Party in the West, was released in 2010 in Japan. This review talks about the PC version, Corpse Party: BloodCovered, or just Corpse Party.\n\n\n[h1][i][PLOT][/i][/h1]\n\nThe plot, how it is presented to the player, the narrative detail of either the thoughts of the characters or their actions, everything is excellently written. I'm just going to explain the main thing to not ruin the experience, if you get to play it. The plot is about a group of students and their teacher, who are sad because it is the last day of one of them in that school as she will be transferred. To encourage things a little, one of them suggests that they perform a charm that she found on the internet and thus be able to be friends forever. They perform the charm and everything seems to go well, until a strong earthquake occurs and they are transported to an old school of which they had only heard in old stories and that supposedly had been demolished. Will the students be able to discover the mysteries of this school and... survive?\n\nCorpse Party's type of horror is psychological horror. This game has a charm to make us feel close to their characters so as we move forward we will be in constant tension, worried about them as we don't know what is going to happen to them. Each one of the characters has a well written and unique personality, causing us to be interested in each one for different reasons. We relate to them, we care about their thoughts. We can see how their personalities change from a common and friendly environment to a lonely and deadly one, when they show the deepest of themselves.\n\nThe game also has visceral horror, but I won'tt go into details about that.\n\n\n[h1][i][GAMEPLAY][/i][/h1]\n\nThe gameplay consists of exploring the scenarios and interacting with the objects on the stage to advance on the plot. In addition, there are different puzzles in each chapter and a decisions system. These decisions, unlike most games that contain these mechanics, [b]do[/b] affect the development of the game so we'll have to think well before making a decision, otherwise we'll get an unwanted ending!\n\n\n[h1][i][VISUALS][/i][/h1]\n\nThe art consists of character sprites in scenes composed by detailed tiles, which create an incredible atmosphere of suspense and solitude. The details of the scenarios are excellent, to the point where they really come to disturb, especially when you find the co...\n\nThe game also has character portraits, which greatly increase their emotional expressions and our closeness to them. These portraits of characters are more used in later chapters of the game, and their quality also increases. The portraits of the extra chapters are certainly excellent, comparable with the PSP version.\n\n\n[h1][i][MUSIC & SOUND][/i][/h1]\n\nThe soundtrack of Corpse Party is one of the best I've ever heard in my life, as simple as that. There is music for every situation whether it be suspense, fear, drama, sad, or hope. The sound effects are not far behind as the game has a 3D sound system that changes depending on the position of the source. These sounds are used to frame actions, and therefore, make them more real. This can be quite shocking if you are not used to it, since in addition to the detailed descriptions you will hear realistic sounds of disturbing things.\n\n\nSo, do I recommend the game? Of course! In fact I think you should be playing it now. But to be honest I recommend you to play its superior version, the PSP / 3DS version. It has better art, new music, and professional voice actors. That's with the Corpse Party with which I fell in love with the series, the one that struck me. If you don't have PSP or 3DS and you don't want to pirate the game, then I recommend buying this one. The advantage of this version over the PSP version is that it has an exclusive extra chapter, telling the story of some students that you'll find as you progress in the game.

This game is only focus on story rather than the game mechanics/gameplay. This game is probably the most f*ck*d up story i ever see in video game (for right now). The story is still the same from psp version. Just wait for the twist, it will blow your mind. You have to reading every dialogue to understand because when i first time playing this, i kinda lost the story.\n\nThe characters is great, i really love all characters. Not only the main chararters, but also the side characters that *COUGHCOUGH spoiler alerts...... die in the school. \n\nEven though is just pixel graphics, like i say, this game is only focus on story, you don't need high end graphics for made things scary. Just like psp version, still pixel graphics\n\nThe music is made game awesome and creepy. Maybe some music is change from psp version, maybe they just improve the sound quality.\n\nEvery horror games must have jumpscare on it, but not this one. Which is good for the pussy\n\nThe voice acting is not that good for me, characters that 17 years old sounds like 9 years old kid. Sometime there are no voice dialogue in the game. BUT, the psp version is so much better, it's full voice and perfect for the characters. \n\nCharacters are not well drawn for the main characters (except side characters). The psp version looks like an anime, which looks good for me. The psp version had more CGs than this version, which is disappointed.\n\n\nThat's it\n1. Only focus on story, not gameplay\n2. Story is really good, but sometime it's hard to understand when progressing the story\n3. The characters is good, nothing to complain\n4. Pixel graphics\n5. The music is.........awesome, nothing to complain\n6. The voice acting is no no -_-\n\nif im being honest, i recommend you to play the psp version, but this version is not disappointed.\n\n7/10\n\neven thought i recommend the psp version doesn't mean i'm not recommend this version, so stfu", "timestamp_created": 1494499778, "timestamp_updated": 1494504297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31657939": {"recommendationid": "31657939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177901389", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503813405}, "language": "english", "review": "i have it for the 3ds but to be honest corpse party games are amazing and an experience you gotta have in your life even if it has an animation style from the early 2000s, its still corpse party bich!", "timestamp_created": 1494382993, "timestamp_updated": 1494451133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31488451": {"recommendationid": "31488451", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970397249", "num_games_owned": 672, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493650285}, "language": "finnish", "review": "Aiemmin ollut saatavissa l\u00e4hinn\u00e4 Plystation k\u00e4sikonsoleille, nyt vihdoin ja viimein my\u00f6s PC:ll\u00e4 joten mik\u00e4p\u00e4s sen mainiompaa .. kyseinen tekele on kyll\u00e4 ehk\u00e4 kaikista ahdistavin, karmivin ja hyyt\u00e4vin peli mit\u00e4 on piiiiitk\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4\u00e4n aikaan tullut pelattua.

This is one of the first of its kind; the story was created back in the late 1990s, and it has since seen numerous remakes, sequels, and adaptations. This is the indie adaptation from ~2008, if memory serves, and, while a bit lacking in the visual department, (no CGs, \"interesting\" character designs...) is definitely a must-play for fans of the RPG horror genre, the PSP remake of the games, and anyone who's up for an adventure. \n\nThe game IS fairly \"anime,\" just as a forewarning - like seriously, if you aren't good with boob jokes and other anime tropes, you might need to brace yourself. And of course there's the infamous \"butter up my pooper\" scene. But to me, that just adds to the game's charm. \n\nCorpse Party is a game able to simultaneously juggle the seriousness and terror that comes with the situation, as well as adding in some absolutely FANTASTIC funny moments (I'm looking at you, Byakudan High), great character chemistry (Mayu and Shig, Naomi and Seiko, Yoshiki and Ayumi). Nothing feels like it was just carelessly placed. Even the individual character nametags you pick up throughout the school have interwoven stories. Seriously, after you collect them, read them. There are some gems. \n\nI could go on for hours about this game, since it's definitely one of my favorites of all time.

The game focuses on you controling a person as they navagate through the hallways while trying to find items, find other studens or saving said students.   There are multiple parts and each part has atleast 2 endings or so.  The endings vary from Good to bad, with I believe one case there is a Neutral ending.  Each ending ties into the next chapter and then eventuall climaxes.  \n\n\nCharacters:   You play as one of the many students in the class.  Depending on your choices, some studens will live while others will die.   None of the students stick out as being really good or amazing, but they have their roles.   As for the main baddie shes, well, shes  twisted and has an interesting but cliche backstory.    There are other things that haunt the school at night besides the main ghost, so caution is needed when you encounter them.\n\n\n\nSounds/Music:   The music is simple but has a very dreadful feel to it, like the type of music that makes you think \"I WANT THE HELL OUT OF HERE,  SOMONE!  PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE SOMEONE HELPPPPPPPP MEEEEEEEEEEE\" type of feel.   Not much variation with the music but it isnt needed since it does its job perfectly.  The sound effects are great.  They fit, they  are done at the best moments  and when mixxed with the music, it can be flatout creepy and make you feel unease.\n\n\n\n\nGameplay:    As I stated in my overview, you play as a student and you can explore the school.  You cant fight enemies that you meet, so running is your only option.  There are various puzzles that are usually simple, but others have a type of \"moral question\" to them.  Very simple case is that you have a newspaper and just as you are about to open it, there is writting on the wall that wasnt there before.  The writing says to NOT OPEN THE NEWSPAPER.  Well, who is going to stop me if I open this?   So you can decide whether to open it, or be respectful and not open it.  And thus, depending on your choice, will decide if certain events occur or not.   Nothing stood out as being too hard.  Somethings might take a second try or more due to an event being fast pace or due to just not knowing what to do until its too late.\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:    If you are in the mood for some spooks and creeps, then I suggest this.  There are a few jump scares but none are bad like the \"AH IM COVERING YOUR SCREEN\" type, just sudden sounds and sudden motions (you know, like the whole lights flicker off, then back on only to see people are missing and then they flicker again, and then a dead body appears)    I personally liked this even if some parts were a pain in having to go back and forth for things.  If you like anime and have a strong stomach, then I suggest watching the anime BUT only do it after playing this game.    Watching it will spoil a mix of good and bad endings.    However, I will warn that the anime is very graphic.  If you dont like the idea of seeing guts slowly spill out, maggots crawling from a person's eye, seeing someone get their tongue cut or eyeballs impaled, then steer clear of it because there are some nasty scenes lol.

It is not very graphically intensive (usually a must for gore-fest horror games), but it more than makes up for that with a legitamatly interesting story, descriptive gore scenes [spoiler](how much damage do you think a pair of scissors can do?)[/spoiler] and great audio.\n\nThe game is split into 5 chapters. In each chapter, you make multiple choices which may effect the outcome of the chapter. There are multiple wrong ends for each chapter and only 1 \"bloodcovered\" end, which is the correct ending of the chapter. Throughout the game, you will have to solve puzzles to progress. For example, if there is an object at the bottom of a filthy pool, you will have to figure out how to get to that item which could be a key to room that you need to visit in order continue.\n\nMy only problem with Corpse Party would be that if you make a wrong choice early on in the chapter, you may not realise the mistake until near the end of the chapter. Chapters can take about 2 hours to complete, so if you don't have a save from before your mistake in one of your 3 save slots, I hope you enjoy replaying the chapter. It is also not always clear what your mistake was. Some say that figuring out where you went wrong is part of the fun, but some of the choices can be as acute as choosing whether or not to read something. If you do get stuck and have no idea what you've done wrong, I would recommend finding a spoiler free walkthrough of that chapter (although I never had to use one).\n\nTo conclude, this is an awesome horror game with an interesting story and good audio.

Others have already pointed out the downgraded art style (which went from realistic to overly chibi for some reason), but the dealbreaker is the voice acting. I'm sure the VA's are fine people who did a good job, but two issues arise:\n\n1) I'm sorry, but the incredibly high-pitched anime voice is like jamming nails into my earholes. This isn't helpful when a whole lot of the dialogue is screaming or crying. A number of the scenes involve multiple talk bubbles of screams or sobs, and they're presented INDIVIDUALLY.\n\n2) For no reason I can discern, quite a number of the dialogues later in the game don't let you speed through them, so you actually HAVE to listen to them be acted out in full time. It happens chiefly during the intro/outro scenes on the chapters, but also in other spots.\n\nThese are made worse by the fact that a whole bunch of those scenes that you can't speed through are just voice/text on a TOTALLY BLACK SCREEN. So basically you have to sit there and listen to a foreign language reciting dialogue you're already finished reading and just hoping it'll hurry the hell up and be over.

Unfortunatley for them, it turns out to be no urban myth and they are whisked away to the hell dimension that is Heavenly Host High School. Seperated into small groups they must try to survive and escape from this dastardly plane that is without doubt out to brutally murder them.\n\nThis game really isn't for the faint of heart, while I would not consider this game scary ala Amnesia the Dark Descent or SOMA, it most definatley disturbing. What the game lacks in graphics it more than makes up for in graphic descriptions of blood and gore. Especially some of the bad endings, of which there are many, are truly awful. So yeah, if you don't like your horror brutal and descruptive, maybe this isn't for you. If you like a good horror novel though, you are going to be right at home.\n\nThe story and characters are really quite engaging. While most of the characters generally fit into broad anime archetypes, seeing how they react to being inside the awfulness the is Heavenly Host makes it interesting and it's cool to see how they work together (or not) as things get more and more horrific and they deal with all kinds of really disturbing events. The story is broken into five chapters and each one builds on the last, slowy revealing each character's back story and the backstory to Heavenly Host itself. It's all well written and extremely engaging, almost every chapter ends with a shock revelation then a cliff hanger ending, meaning its hard to just stop at the end of an episode. You're going to feel compelled to start the next one just to see what happens.\n\nIt's also worth getting the bad endings, just for the extra insight they can provide on the plot. Not to mention this is where you are going to get some of the most gruesome stuff the game has to offer.\n\nThis is a really great game and I can't recommend it enough. If you are at all into this kind of thing you have probably seen the positive reviews on Steam itself and in other media. It really deserves the respect it gets, and if you can look past the 16 bit graphics, you are in for a hell of a ride.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1483535645, "timestamp_updated": 1498096023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28858162": {"recommendationid": "28858162", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994372073", "num_games_owned": 595, "num_reviews": 337, "playtime_forever": 963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482990702}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Absolutely thrilling[/h1]\n\nHoly fuck what an amazing game\n\nThis writing, just damn. No wonder they made a show based off this game. No wonder it's so popular. \n\nIt starts off scary as shit, but soon it takes a shift I never saw coming. It becomes LEGITIMATELY INTERESTING. I am FASCINATED with this game's story. \n\nThe soundtrack is killer. Just listen to this funky ass beat\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbcQWHn6Jk4\n\nHot damn, they didn't even need to make good music. A purely atmospheric, low effort soundtrack would have been perfectly acceptable in this nightmarish hellscape where dreams turn to nightmares and kill you for eternity. Nope, not good enough, they made a badass soundtrack worthy of being listened to by itself. The musican, much like everyone in the small group of developers, wanted to make an outstanding game. \n\nI think the only bit of flak I can offer this game is in its fundamental design. If you make a bad decision early on it might not come back to bite you in the ass until two hours later, forcing you to restart a chapter. You can fast-forward the text, so you don't lose much time, but it's still an annoyance to redo everything from an early point. Even worse if you don't guess the correct solution and get slammed with a gameover after doing the more reasonable decision (which the game thinks is wrong)\n\nLike in Chapter 1 you find a corpse in a locked room. Next to it the floor is scrawled \"don't read the newspaper.\" I've played Paper Mario. The last time I was told not to read something by some spooky shit, I read it and I got hit with a game over. Here, the opposite happened. To not get hit with a bad ending an hour later you have to disobey the corpse and read it. Bullshit. I lucked into guessing the right options in chapters 2-4 first try, but the final chapter and it's myriad of outcomes, good fucking luck guessing the right options for it on your first try. \n\nThis game is available on several handheld consoles.

No content has been added or removed from the Japanese version, and very little was changed from a gameplay standpoint (limited to unifying certain systems that changed from chapter to chapter, like the map titles).\n\nCorpse Party is a horror game that sticks with you because of its strong characters. While some horror stories are quick to introduce and off unlikable characters just to show that there is danger, Corpse Party makes sure you actually feel the impact of each terrible situation. The first few deaths are not of people that had it coming, but characters that clearly didn't deserve to die. This sets up the threat and malice of the villains in a way that a straight-up slasher movie usually doesn't go for. Because of this, even knowing who will live or die doesn't make things any better. Those who die are the ones you wished could live, while those that survive are forever scarred by the experience.\n\nPart of the popularity of this first entry into the modern Corpse Party continuity also lies in how it grounds its horror in the familiar, and doesn't rely on any single type of horror. The creator has admitted that the franchise is meant to have ero-guro content, but there is a lot more to the story than blood and gore. The setting of an old schoolhouse is something eeriely familiar, even outside of the original Japanese audience. There's something spooky about wandering the dark hallways at night, and Corpse Party takes it further by showing how such a familiar location could be home to horrible activities. This juxtoposition of the familiar and the strange/terrible is a staple of Eastern Horror, but this game is a great example of why that works and continues to be utilized.\n\nThe gameplay of Corpse Party: BloodCovered is relatively simple, using basic RPG Maker controls (a nod to its RPG Maker roots) and lock/key puzzles. The trick to Corpse Party is that the \"locks\" aren't always obvious, and sometimes not having the \"key\" item or choice will lead to a bad ending (stylized as \"Wrong End\"). However, these endings are as much a part of the story as the \"clear\" or \"true\" endings. Some aspects of the characters simply aren't seen outside of these alternate endings, motivating a collector's urge to see every potential fate. There are also more standard collectables in the form of nametags, but these are more for completionists and to hide a few easter eggs (such as the nametags of characters from Corpse Party Zero, or people that worked on the game).\n\nFor those that enjoy horror adventure games that rely more on character and story than trying to shock the player through jumps, Corpse Party is a great choice. It may not be the most \"original\" story, being heaviliy inspired by certain types of urban legends, but it is a story that can stick with you if you let yourself become attached to the characters. For those worried about the gore content, this version of the game is the least gory, as it relies on text descriptions or sprite animations for most of the deaths.\n\nIf you enjoy this version of Corpse Party, I'd also highly recommend playing its 3DS version (Corpse Party: BloodCovered:...Repeated Fear) and that game's sequels (Book of Shadows, Sachiko's Game of Love: Hysteric Birthday 2U [currently JPN only], and Blood Drive). If you want to see where the series began, picking up the original 1996 PC-98 game and a PC-98 emulator (or playing the fan remake \"Corpse Party -Rebuilt-\") is also a good idea.\n\nAnd since I'm sure people want to know (and don't always look before asking), here are some of the major differences between BloodCovered (BC/this game) and BloodCovered:...Repeated Fear (BR 3DS):\n\n[b][Corpse Party: BloodCovered][/b]\nOriginal version of Chapter 1-4\nRevised version of Chapter 5 (2 new endings, 1 extended ending)\nExtra Chapters 1-3, Tooth\nOriginal Artwork\nAmateur Voicetrack and Vocal Songs\n\n[b][Corpse Party: BloodCovered:...Repeated Fear][/b]\nRevised version of Chapter 1-4 (altered/added scenes, 1 new ending)\nOriginal version of Chapter 5 (plus one ending from BC that was not in BR PSP/iOS)\nExtra Chapters 1-14\nRedrawn Artwork\nProfessional Voicetrack and Vocal Songs", "timestamp_created": 1479940605, "timestamp_updated": 1479940816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539642", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26842478": {"recommendationid": "26842478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065730158", "num_games_owned": 492, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501630135}, "language": "english", "review": "Butter up my pooper", "timestamp_created": 1479931284, "timestamp_updated": 1479931284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26751880": {"recommendationid": "26751880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275799614", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498416028}, "language": "french", "review": "g\u00e9nial mais un soucis les artworks sont un peu perturbant pour ce qui ont fait la version psp :3", "timestamp_created": 1479844210, "timestamp_updated": 1479844210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26707718": {"recommendationid": "26707718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324464484", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479799653}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome!!

However, in this school, no one is safe. You'll come across so many victims which surprisingly you get to know their name and how they died thanks to ID Collecting. In fact, if you make a wrong move, you too may end up being a victim in the game's many many Wrong Ends. There is only ONE way out that is considered canon and will help build up the next episode. Some episodes do have alternate not wrong endings, but again, only one is considered canon. It's up to you to replay and see what you can find throughout. In addition, Extra Episodes are included, and while they don't last long, they do give some behind the scenes moments and/or some interesting stories featuring other characters. This Steam version even includes a chapter from its sequel Book of Shadows.\nWhat's really nice is the music that plays when navigating. It may be a scary game, but when not in very dangerous rooms, you'll hear themes that get you motivated to move on, determined to find a way out. But when you are in scary rooms, you'll definitely feel the panic rushing in you as you try not to avoid death.\nThis may be a cute 16-bit RPG game with some VN-styled art, but should you encounter death or [spoiler] the four, no three victims of the murder, with one being the real mastermind... [/spoiler] you'll see just how gruesome this game can be. It's not meant for the young ones, or the faint of heart. Don't be fooled by the style its going for. Even the swanky text box (thanks XSEED Tumblr blog) screams spooky.\nAt the end, you'll be happy you braved through the horror this game has to offer. While it's the original remake (which is based on the even older RPGMaker version) and not the PSP/iOS/3DS port that has CGs, and in the 3DS's case, additional endings and chapters, you're still getting a good game, and after 8 years we finally see what it originally was like before MAGES. held the licence for Team GrisGris, and before Team Grindhouse made the still MIA sequel, Dead Patient. It's a horror game that gets better and better as you play and surely, you'll be sad if you like a particular wifey from the game and that wifey died.

I just couldn't look away from it till the end. Then I saw the OVA and was disappointed in that... some story changes and how it was delievered was flat to me. Only redeeming factor is that the graphic violence and gore was further than what you can see in the games.\n\nAnyway... I really loved this game. I just kept wanting to know more about the school, the ghost children, the history behind it... it delievered but didn't satisfy it completely and only gave me more questions.\n\nThe music is fantastic though. Fits the mood, the situation, event, etc. I wish there was a soundtrack on Steam for me to get. I loved it and there's a few tracks I would love to hear again.\n\nThere's a few issues I had though.\n\nThe (living) female characters are so soft and fragile, except for the teacher. The males have to abide to their crying and be the strong ones. There's not much character development, none of the girls get any tougher, but instead stay consistent throughout. After awhile you'd get used to your surroundings, but these girls freak out one thing after another...\n\nDon't get me started on the little sister... ugh... hate her. \"ONICHAN! OOONIIIICHAAAAN!\" Yes, we get it, you're scared and alone... shut up already! Don't need to call him out everytime something scary happens either... useless character.\n\nI didn't listen to the voice acting as I had that turned off, to spare myself of the \"OOONIIIIIIICHAAAAAAN!\" whining everytime something spooks her fragile young soul... ugh. Yes she's a child, but holy crap there was times I wish she would die in the true ending! [spoiler]Darn girl has some deep love for her brother too... I hate that anime trope... so disturbing and a HUGE cliche. Girl has problems and needs to get out more, and not be so inloved with her own brother. Ugh... Hate her SO much.[/spoiler]\n\nThere's a few plots holes too that are circling in my head.\n\n[spoiler]Satoshi mentions the supposed murderer hanged himself, but I don't recall reading about it, and found it odd he would mention it before even seeing the corpse.[/spoiler]\n[spoiler]There's no explanation of why the principle went from a kind person to a molester. According to the nurse's diary, it was out of character for him.[/spoiler]\n[spoiler]One of the students turned serial killer was hit by the supposed murderer, but we don't know what happened to him. Last seen being dragged away.[/spoiler]\n[spoiler]The body model in the science lab is also a mystery to me. Who was under that sheet?[/spoiler]\n[spoiler]Why was the supposed murderer obeying a girl that was a dark spirit? What reason was there?[/spoiler]\nand there's a bit more but that's all I can recall.\n\nMy game kept freezing at the intro of chapter 4, but worked again after the intro played. Doesn't seem like many people have that issue, so most likely a technical issue on my end.\n\nThe layout of the school (before chapter 5) can be confusing to navigate through that I would find myself lost a few times of where to go next. The layout during chapter 5 didn't help either...\n\nHad some trouble finding a certain nametag or figuring out what I did wrong in a chapter. I accidentally gotten an ending that has to be most common to get without even trying, yet I'm glad I gotten the true ending last so my view of the entire story wouldn't get mixxed up.\n\nOverall, it's worth the full price. Don't wait for a sale. The PSP/iOS (and now 3DS) versions have better graphics with CG in it, but this version still gets the job done.\n\nIf you love stories with horror, death, gore, and slight torture, you'll want to get this treasure.

Actually, meant as a sign for their everlasting friendship with their transferring schoolmate the so-called \u201cSachiko Ever After\u201d teleports them instead to the neverending nightmare called Heavenly Host Elementary, one of the top contenders on everyone's personal list of places you sure as hell won't be.\n\nThe main story is hereby divided into five chapters plus four short extra chapters mostly focusing on side characters. In the course of this story will not only the fate of the students be explained but also the reason for the failing of the charm as well as the reason for the existence of this cursed space where just everything tries to kill you. All this is woven into a rather complex and interesting story. Each chapter has one true (canon) ending and several (up to nine) alternate or wrong endings which are often just different ways to die. \n\nThe game plays like shown in the screenshot as a normal rpg maker game. You control the characters (which change from chapter to chapter and also during a chapter) from a birdview perspective. Most time you are running around, talk with ghosts and other survivors and explore the school building in order to find a way out for yourself and your friends. As a genre I would probably pick horror adventure. This should already tell you what to expect: No real combat, no jump scares (most of the time it is clearly visible if a situation will lead to death or not), a lot of text to read and some light puzzle elements and nearly no hectic moments.\n\nThe graphic aspect as typical for RPG maker games is rather simple but there has been spent some efforts even in tiny details and for what the games want to be it works fine. The dialogues between the students are (partially?) voiced in japanese. The music is most of the time eerie supporting the general atmosphere of the cursed school. From time to time there are also some faster tracks which you would not expect in a horror game but I think they are strangely fitting for the specific scenes. Speaking of the atmosphere, it is the strong point of the game. The remnants of other students, the story of what happened and created this horrific place, the wrong endings describing the characters death, all of those portrait how gruesome Heavenly Host Elementary is and generate a really creepy atmosphere.\n\nI have read the manga and even seen the anime (which leads to a different ending than the game) before but it is probably better to play the game without this knowledge. But the existence of both manga and anime already show the popularity of the game and can be taken as sign for the quality of the story.\n\nAll in all [b] Corpse Party [/b] delivers a really interesting experience and can be recommanded to any horror fan who doesn't take his kick out of realistic graphics and jump scares. So buy and play the game, find the origin of this curse, try to survive and whatever you do, always remember: \"No hard feelings.\"\n\n\nPS: If you have any questions write a comment. I'll try to answer them to the best of my ability.\nPPS: Looking around online you may notice that there exists versions (PSP, 3DS) with CG's.

It originally started as an RPG Maker game that was released only in Japan in the 90s and then a decade later it got remastered and released in North America. \n\nSince this game is technically an RPG Maker game it doesn't function like one. It has a menu that you would expect from an RPG game as well as characters HP but its never really put to use. Which makes this an interacting story driven that just so happens to be made with RPG Maker. \n\nThe games story is told through 5 chapters as well as few extra chapters to tell a few side storys about some characters . The main chapters have mult. endings for you to discover. Most endings are kinda similar but some have a unique twist to the story and the game makes you want to discover all of them. All the characters are very well acted and makes you have a connection to them since the story will add a lot of depth to them. The dialogue is very well written that the characters feel like they are actually real people that are trying to survive. The \"True\" ending is very satisifying and will make you remember this creepy story for a while.\n\nThe chapters will have moments that you have solve puzzles in order to progress and some have to be done in a specific order so you can get the right ending. As well as avoiding certain objects in the environment in order to survive. The game does have save points scattered throughout the environment and you will want to make sure you use them in case you mess something up. I managed to beat the game and find all the name tags and endings in under 15 hr. with the help of a guide, and I can tell you I loved every second of it.\n\nConclusion: Corpse Party is a series that if you love interactive storys and some good horror you will have an amazing experience out of this. However if you want something like combat and could care less about a story... this game is not for you. \n\nIf you want to get into the rest of the series you are going to want to start out with this game first, then Corpse Party Book of Shadows, and then Corpse Party Blood Drive which is exclusive to the PS Vita which I can't wait get into!!! You can get the entire series on the PS Vita since the first 2 games are on the PSP.\n\nRating 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1470952440, "timestamp_updated": 1470952440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24763763": {"recommendationid": "24763763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072163881", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473527390}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't do charms kids.", "timestamp_created": 1470592586, "timestamp_updated": 1470592586, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550802", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24738946": {"recommendationid": "24738946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185522666", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504086004}, "language": "german", "review": "kommt dem original auf der vita in vielen ans\u00e4tzen gleich", "timestamp_created": 1470474548, "timestamp_updated": 1470474548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.381342", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24697427": {"recommendationid": "24697427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095003938", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480870240}, "language": "english", "review": "This is probably one of the best games i have ever, ever, EVER played...! It has the horror genre... obviously... by seeing the title of the game you could probably figure that out... This is not the original Corpse Party though... (this is Corpse Party: Blood Covered... the one Im writing about right now) because the version from 1996... was released ONLY in Japan the 22th April... The platform was called NEC PC-9801 I think... this game though, the one Im writing about... I don't think it was released at Steam that long ago... Um... but at least in the beginning when it was released 2008, after that one there was a remake the same year: Corpse Party: Blood Covered: Repeated Fear... and then there is 3 sequels to it... (so far...) Corpse Party: Books of Shadows and Corpse Party: Blood Drive plus Corpse Party 2: Dead Patient which I haven't played... yet.\n\nStory *SPOILER ALERT* The story is about 7 students from a class with their teacher that performs a charm (found on the internet/ a blog somewhere) that will apparently make all of them friends forever and never seperated from each other... but however if they fail the charm (just what happens to them...) something bad happens... they will anger a little girl named Sachiko and then get a horrible punishment (the charm is called: The Sachiko-charm) and after they fail the charm they get seperated from each other in an abandoned ghost-school with closed spaces meaning that it wouldn't be possible to find each other in the school, unless... something happened... something that i can't remember but it would make the closed spaces smaller somehow.. and could make it more possible to find each other in the school... however they didn't become seperated like... from at least one other person to accompany them on the journey throughout the unknown corridors, classrooms, pool and other places... and ghosts, monsters and unknown creatures to pursue them throughout the whole game... there is more than just games in this franchise there's an anime, manga and a live-film too... but the anime is not worth to watch... the manga is very different, if you try to combine the story from the manga together with this game... you're not gonna get far...\n\nI love the music in this game, and that you can get many wrong ends which means that you have to replay to find the true ending for each chapter... and i admire the character development and ship so many people in a pair together... with each other but... there's no luck for my wishes... because every girl is in love with one, ONE guy named Satoshi who is a coward, and not the delinquent-looking dude: Yoshiki that tries to protect his friend and the one that he truly truly care about: a girl named Ayumi. But like i said the coward has a harem story throughout the whole game... almost. I also get very confused and creative when it comes to the puzzles in this game... but they are very clever and makes sense... somehow but still really f***ing hard to solve... not all... but some... and the horror in this game... is... good... but I think the Corpse Party- game that takes the price in being the most creepiest of them all is... the remake, it has more content, better voice-acting and a little better art for the characters... so I recommend to play that one instead of this one... but still this game is very good anyway even if it has less content than the remake...\n\nI love this game!!! <3 10/10 I recommend it very very much if you want a complicated story and good everything... however the end of this game made me shake and cry, both because it was very intense and sad as hell... and I wanna play the other sequels because I wanna see the continuation in this never-ending story... lol... however it's a little disappointing to see the game take a little content from the concept of the anime and game: Higurashi: no naku koro ni... because all the characters that died in this game are alive again in the sequels and it is the same date when they came into the ghost-school... but the story just changes a little more and more differently than how \"this game's story\" turned out to be about... But still, try to find the remake or buy this game... It's still the same story in both of them so it doesn't have that much of a difference...

Most people will probably dissagree with me on that, but I actually enjoy not having them. It makes the game a little easier to 'Stomach' I guess is the word. Not a coward, I played through the original, but this one has a charm to it that I enjoy just a little bit more.\n\nIf you guys want to check out gameplay of this version, I welcome you to check out my first episode of it right here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddZha1rNlTY\n\nI hope it helps decide if you want to emulate the game,or purchase this newer version.

I played this game with a group of friends and we each chose characters that we would voice ourselves and I found myself pretty much becoming the charactes that I had chosen. Personally, I loved the game and I fully intend on playing the other games in the series eventually.

Un fallo, una muerte. \nPara guardar una partida tendremos que buscar velas encendidas que estar\u00e1n por alguna parte del colegio.

I've replayed it dozens and dozens of times I'm just so in love with it. I'm pretty sure I know every little detail about the series by now hahahah, which is why I feel the need to write this review expressing my true opinion of this newer PC version. \n\nThe story of Corpse Party is amazing. It's spooky and mysterious, keeping players interested, immersed and on their toes throughout the game. Especially for fans of horror. You get absorbed into it so easily and you grow a real liking and attachment to each of the characters, routing for them to survive to the end. My personal favourite is Yoshiki Kishinuma lol. It makes you really wanna find out more about the background of the story and the characters themselves, which calls for repetitive playthroughs of all the games (including the spin-off) and (if you're a bit sadly obsessed like me) some research on the side. For an RPG as well, might I add the gameplay graphics are rather fascinating. \n\nI could literally go on and on about this game and the other games in the Corpse Party series but I feel like doing that might spoil it for new players hahaha. Basically, the PSP game is flawless and you gotta check it out for yourselves. Even if you don't have a PSP, there are YouTubers who play through the PSP series (Blood Covered, Book Of Shadows and Blood Drive) such as PewDiePie and ManlyBadassHero (my personal recommendations). And if you're looking to get more involved with the series, there is a spin-off called Corpse Party 2U which you cannot find in English, only in Japanese, but AnimeMan does playthrough it and subtitles it to English if you're interested. \n\nBut if you're looking for a lighter, less detailed version of the game, just to kind of see what it's like for yourself if you can't get your hands on a PSP or the game, or even just don't really enjoy playthrough videos, you can also play this PC version. Though, being familiar with the original series, I see this as kind of a light introduction or tutorial haha. But once you witness the real series, you will totally be amazed.\n\nYou might be wondering why I'm not a big fan of the PC version. Well, a few things that I dislike about it are: \n- the reduced quality of the character artwork. Before, the character artwork was amazing, detailed too, but now they look rather cartoonish (ironically enough) and a little ridiculous. Slightly cuter, but not what I was looking for in this game. \n- they have cut out the CG pictures that really helped the player capture and feel the moment.\n- the voice actors are different and slightly less immersive in their acting. Also voice acting is a lot less in general.\n- bits of the soundtrack have changed\n- some details of the story (nothing major really but they can be important) are missing\n- you cannot quick save like before\n\nI was hoping this game would be like Blood Drive graphics wise and with the character artwork. Also the original voice actors. Though, I'm guessing this wasn't made by the original game creators? I'm not sure. I just feel like they really slacked off for this version. But other than these things, the game is still great and well made in terms of spookiness and content. They've even added in some extra things too which makes it extra spooky! One of which gave me goosebumps hahaha. I'd recommend this game to anyone, but I'd suggest the PSP series quicker than this version. I'd also love to see an updated version of this to be exactly like the originals. Though that probably won't happen.

It's unpredictability and shocking twists will keep you going till the very last chapter. The sound design and voice acting (although in Japanese) is top notch and really sets the mood. For those looking for something unique, original, and truly unsettling it's definitely worth trying. \n\nAstonishingly creepy and shamelessly violent, with equal and fair indifference to all of its characters, Corpse Party is one of the most, if not the single most, most brutal video attacks on your tolerance for real horror.

The title can tell you that much. And when I saw that this game had come to Steam, I decided to buy a copy for myself and my huggable friend to see what this game truly had to offer.\n\nAnd what followed next... well lets just say I'm glad this game was in 2D RPG Maker sprites, because this game is all kinds of fucked up. Throughout the entire experience you are treated to an endless amount of horrible things either that have happened or that you will see happen, usually involving sharp objects and angry spirits. Yet despite the gorefest, there is real story here, and I was interested in seeing where everything led. Having finished it all, and deciding not to spoil anything, I'd say it was pretty good. :D\n\nGameplay is sort of an RPG/Adventure game thing where you roam about, figure out where to go next, and try not to die horribly at one of the many points that this game tries to kill you. It's not the most interesting gameplay in the world, but it works fine. It's certainly not a VN where all you do is just have dialogue choices.

While it doesn't have as much content as the PSP and 3DS versions, it does contain some new wrong ends in Chapter 5 of the game. Even if you have picked up other versions of Corpse Party, this one is different enough to warrent a purchase.

Aber zuerst eine Anmerkung. Das von mir verfasste Review gilt nicht der Steam Version, sondern voll und ganz der PSP \nVersion: Corpse Party Blood Covered \"Repeatet Fear\" !! \n\nDas hat einen ganz einfachen Grund. Die Steam Version ist n\u00e4mlich zensiert!   \nSomit wird das ganze Spielerlebnis und die Erfahrungen von Horror, Gore, Psychological und die atemberaubend gute japanische Synchro einfach weggenommen und stattdessen gegen \"Blackscreen\" ausgetauscht oder einfach komplett rausgenommen. Und das bei einem Spiel welches genau auf diesen wichtigen Genres basiert! \n\nBescheuert oder? Aber genug der Meckerei, Kommen wir nun zu den zahlreichen positiven Aspekten des Spiels (von der PSP Version, nicht von der Steam version). Das Spiel Corpse Party hat gerade einmal 800MB und trotzdem haben sie es geschafft diese 800MB in ein Meisterwerk zu verwandeln!!\n\nZur Story: Ein paar Freunde f\u00fchren in ihrer Schule ein Ritual aus welches \"Sachiko ever after\" genannt wird dieses Ritual soll n\u00e4mlich angeblich den Bund ihrer Freundschaft st\u00e4rken. Aber als das Ritual vollf\u00fchrt wurde befanden sie sich auf einmal in einer anderen Schule die eigentlich schon abgerissen ist. Umso mehr sie diese Schule inspizierten, merken sie in was f\u00fcr einer kranken Situation sie sich eigentlich befinden, denn es gibt keinen Ausgang und auch kein Entkommen. Ihre Freundschaft und ihr \u00fcberleben wird auf eine harte Probe gestellt. \n\nNun kommen wir zum fantastischen Gameplay: W\u00e4hrend des Spielens m\u00fcsst ihr oft schwierige Entscheidungen treffen die sich im nachhinein sp\u00e4ter auf die Story auswirken und auch ab und zu zum \"Wrong End\" f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen. Und wenn ihr so wie ich mit dem Spiel mitgefiebert habt, dann werden euch diese Entscheidungen wirklich total schwer fallen, weil halt nicht immer offensichtlich ist, was die richtige Entscheidung gewesen w\u00e4re. Das Spiel \u00fcberzeugt w\u00e4hrend des Gameplays mit einer Atmosph\u00e4re, herbeigef\u00fchrt durch die immer zutreffende Hintergrundmusik und manchmal eingeblendeten Bildern die dann das Geschehen noch besser beschreiben. W\u00e4hrend des Gameplays m\u00fcsst ihr die Untertitel lesen, dass ist aber nicht so eint\u00f6nig, wie es sich anh\u00f6rt, da diese zu gegebenen Zeiten, passend mit einer japanischen Synchro hinterlegt sind. Da das Spiel sehr alt ist kann man von der Grafik nicht wirklich was erwarten, die ist n\u00e4mlich in 2D gehalten, aber trotzdem gut gemacht. Ein etwas negativer Punkt ist aber, dass es in dem Spiel keine Anleitung gibt und man somit wirklich lange mit der Suche nach dem richtigen Item oder dem richtigen Weg besch\u00e4ftigt ist. Aber auch dass wird durch kleine Hinweisdialoge im Spiel kenntlich gemacht, bedeutet das man jeden Dialog lesen muss, weil n\u00e4mlich in genau diesem Dialog, die L\u00f6sung zu finden w\u00e4re.\n\nDas Spiel hat 5 Kapitel und in jedem Kapitel kann man zu sogenannten \"Wrong Ends\" kommen, welche aufgrund von falschen Entscheidungen herbeigef\u00fchrt werden k\u00f6nnen. Die Spieldauer betr\u00e4gt locker um die 3 tage und wenn man alles herausfinden will bestimmt 2-3 Wochen.\n\nFazit: Dieses Spiel ist ein Meisterwerk, man merkt richtig wie viel M\u00fche sich die Entwickler hierbei gegeben haben und dass sieht man allein schon daran, dass das Spiel ein eigenes Opening hat!! Wer also auf unglaubliche Charaktere, eine sehr gute Story, psychologische Aspekte, Anime, Horror und Gore steht, der sollte sich dieses Spiel auf jedenfall kaufen!!!", "timestamp_created": 1464234504, "timestamp_updated": 1464235005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23211926": {"recommendationid": "23211926", "author": {"steamid": "76561198230073032", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464305829}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, I was a great fan of the series already, already read the manga and watched the OVA, I also kept discussing the lore history with friends of mine so you might consider my judgment of this game as unfair or biased. \n\nEven so, I really liked to play this game, sure enough, knowing about the remade avatars for the PSP version of the game made me cringe a little at the art. I would like to see a higher quality version, with the fullres images at the endings and cutscenes [for the sake of Blood, if you know me ;D]. If you want to enjoy every bit of it, your gameplay shall reach the 15~20 hours or so, maybe more if you don't know what to do, so it is at a good lenght. \n\nI really like the fact that the original sound in Japanese was present, since I'm a fan of subtitles more than dub. Knowning a little of japanese makes it extra fun to predict what they are going to say when you bat an eye at the translated text. BUT the voice acting of some main characters is not that great and are quite annoying. For my personal preferences they focused too much on the \"childish cry\"-like voice. I really expected Shinozaki to have a slightly deeper/variable/macabre inducing voice. But some characters are very well dubbed, specially KIZAMI!\n\nSadly, if you want to play the follow-up games, you will find yourself inabled to without a portable like PSP or 3DS. And this is a somewhat considable letdown of the franchise. But still, the conclusion given at the present game, or shall I say, multiple conclusions, are already satisfiying per se. \n\nThe game mechanics are what you might find in current indie Horror RPG-maker based games, with a twist here and there but nothing too elaborate.

Corpse Party originated as an indie pc game in 1996. It got a cell phone remake but it was canceled due to the development of this PC remake (the one on steam). In Japan this game is called \"Corpse Party Blood Covered\" and was released in 2008 episodicly. It got a PSP remake we known as \"Corpse Party Blood Covered Repeated Fear\" released in 2010 but was called simply as \"Corpse Party\" by xseed. A 3DS port was released on 2015 in Japan and the english version will be released sometime this summer. \n\nUghh, see how confusing that was? Technically you don't need to play all versions of Corpse Party. If you've played ether psp, 3ds or pc versions you won't be missing out on much. It's the same game with same characters. You can continue with Book of Shadows then Blood Drive for the PSP and Vita. \n\nThe series has gotten a manga series and a anime OVA (I personally don't like the OVA for its many problems), and a live action movie with a sequel on the way.\n\nWell that's great, now how about the actual game? Corpse Party is about a group of students who do an innocent sounding ritual for a friendship charm that goes wrong. They end up in a school that was once demolished and rebuilt as their school. They are trapped in a school from the past with vengeful ghost and traps at every corner. The game sticks to its routes being a RPG horror game that allows you to see the game from a different perspective of the characters trying to find a way back home.\n\nThe game has many endings and as messed up as it sounds you can collect name tags from corpses and find out how they died from the main menu. Depending what endings you get you can unlock extra chapters that expand the story. This makes dying or making the possible wrong choices worth your while.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, like it's psp and 3ds counterparts it has some parts that would take a few tries to get through. The translation done by xseed is a little off like a few lines not matching up to what the character voices are saying or the text box saying something completely different compared to the Japanese version.\n\nCorpse Party is an interesting spin as a horror RPG with retro character sprites. It offers different art style and voices compared to the modern versions of the game for psp and 3ds. Many complaints are from people who are ether misinformed about this PC version or expect this to be a port of the psp game which is the opposite. If you have already played the psp or 3ds version you're not missing out on anything. Just continue with Book of Shadows then Blood Drive.

We were going through a rough time and I was still adjusting to life.  My dad is the sweetest guy and one day got me a laptop to help me cope. That's when I discovered Youtube. \n\nCorpse Party was the very first Let's Play I had ever seen, I was watching Cry play it and I fell in love with it right away. I was a weird kid, I loved horror games, however I was a wimp and too scared to play them myself. I still am, but every day I would watch a new video in the playlist and fall more and more in love with this spooky little dream of a game. \n\nWhen Corpse Party came onto steam I knew I had to get it and I did almost right away.

I personally recommend this version of Corpse Party.\n\nAt least, if you are one of those people who prefer imagination with their horror. I personally found the CGs from the PSP version ruining some of the intense moments in the game. Remember that scene where Ayumi breaks and her pink/white pantsu flashing? yeah. If you absolutely hate that or end up cracking in laughter at how stupid it looks, then get this version. This version also feels more like a horror game with its sound and atmosphere.\n\nWhile I found the premise of Corpse Party as uninteresting, it's how they executed it that makes it really enjoyable. And I always enjoyed interesting storytelling with limited assets. This version doesn't fail to deliver. If you are one of those people, you will like this game.\n\nI also recommend playing this with a guide. It will save you from needless backtracking and enjoy the narrative better. Especially around chapter 5 where if you do something first, you lock yourself out completely from the true ending because you can't obtain a specific statue. It also makes getting the bad endings easier for completion's sake. If you are against this, then be prepared to backtrack a lot. Especially when the perspective of this game can be quite confusing (the stairwell) and the same layout of the buildings confusing you. It can also be unfair like guessing who is what without even giving you a visual or physical description of your target (you'll see what I mean when you get there).\n\nThe inconsistent portrait art style can be a bit distracting, the glaring example is that the assets look like a less impressive version of the PSP art and plopped in with this versions art, to point, Byakudan students. Thankfully they rarely appear that it's almost non-issue. \n\nThis game however isn't free of bugs. Expect the game to crash and burn randomly when saving. Make sure to fill up all 3 slots when you can. You might also want to avoid the 2nd Save Slot in the 5th Chapter. Since the latest update, I cannot save properly on that slot and keep losing progress.\n\nI also have to give glowing praises to this game's soundtrack. I always found it to be the best thing about the CP games and is the mood setter. The voice acting isn't as good in the PSP version in my opinion, but they pass.\n\nSo yeah, it's cheap and enjoyable enough. Go get it.\n\n\n\nps.

Despite the fact that I kinda know what's gonna happen, the Actual Game is keeping me interested. \n\nI like how it's split into chapters, and each one has it's own Right End, and one or more Wrong Ends. Certain Wrong Ends are explored in the anime, while the Manga, from what I've read, tries to hold true to the mystery of the Right End. I digress. Each chapter has mulitiple possible endings, only one of which is right. And even the right ending might seem like a Wrong End, but the game will tell you if it is a Wrong End.\n\nThe difficulty progression is kinda ridiculous, First chapter basically walks you through a Right End, and then Chapter Two is like, 'HAAAHAAAAA Good luck, SUCKER!\" The way to make a RIght End just gets more complicated, but at the same time there are more Wrong Ends, so it's a very trial-and-error- sort of deal.\n\nNot sure if you can get a Wrong End in chapterA and still move to chapterB. I've been playing till I get the RIght End, even cheating with online guides when I get stuck. *Hangs head in shame* Judge me after you try Chapter 3 with no help.\n\nI digress.

I can't stand it, especially jumpscares. But what I do enjoy is a good story and writing, which this game seemed to contain. Once I was completely certain that this game didn't have any jumpscares, I bought it and blindly dived into this masterpiece of a game, and I didn't regret doing so one bit. So, here is a completely unbiased review from someone who hasn't been in contact with any Corpse Party media before.\n\n+ A great story. Not the best I've experienced in a game, but it's sure up there. I really couldn't put this game down since I got it and it's basically all I've been playing for a while now. The story alone is worth getting this for imo. It's a fairly text heavy game, as there are parts of the game where you're basically only reading text. As you get further into the story, you will begin to realize how messed up the whole scenario actually is.\n\n+ The soundtrack is phenomenal, and so is the voice acting. When I first started playing I had to lower the volume since the ambient music alone spooked me. That loud ringing noise when entering the infirmary is still in my head. Worth keeping in mind is that there is no English VA, but this didn't really bother me personally as I prefer Japanese VA anyway.\n\n+ The gameplay is decent, it gets the job done so to speak. You basically just walk around the school interacting with objects while encountering different types of puzzles, running from ghosts, or accomplishing something before a timer runs out. It's possible to describe it as a hybrid between a VN and adventure game, similarly to the Ace Attorney series. As it's mainly about the story, I didn't feel the gameplay was particularly detrimental to the experience in general. However, you still need to pay attention to what you're doing or you'll stumble into a bad end, called wrong end in this game. Sometimes I intentionally picked a dialogue option that seemed worse than the other to trigger a wrong end, but ended up progressing the story instead. I feel somewhat bad for people who always try to pick the seemingly good option...\n\n+ Since there are a ton of wrong ends to experience, the game seems to last for a long time, especially if you want all of the achievements. There are also quite a few extra chapters I'll be looking to play soon. It took me about 20h to finish the game + a couple of wrong ends, but I'm definitely not one of the quickest gamers out there. I didn't use a guide either, and I found this to help with the sense of helplessness the game tries to promote.\n\n- I really don't have a lot of negative things to say about this. I found that a lot of the characters look very similar so I had some issues keeping up with all the names and who was who. I also found that when watching a wrong end unfold, some of the text would skip when pressing the A button while the text is being written out (I'm using a 360-controller). I also had some issues with controls during a certain chase scene, but I assume this is controller exclusive problem, as I completed it just fine when quickly switching over to keyboard. In addition to that I also wish there was an option to run through the hallways.\n\nNow, to the million dollar question, is it worth 15\u20ac? For me, yes, for others, maybe not. It depends on what you feel makes a game worth its pricetag. For the average person it will probably take about 10h to complete it, but personally I don't think a game's length should determine the price of it. I don't regret buying this one bit, and as soon as I heard the menu music I knew I was in for a hell of a ride.\n\nTo sum it up, I definitely recommend this game, even for you guys out there who are as easily scared as me. While I found the game to be overall pretty creepy, it wasn't all about spooks and the story alone made me love the game. Don't let the graphics fool you though, this game is incredibly well done and has a ton of detail put into it. However, I will note that this game may turn some people off since it's more about the story than gameplay. Basically, if you don't like horror or reading, then it probably isn't for you. On the other hand, if you're looking for a superb story-driven title, look no further.\n\nWith its brilliant writing and intense atmosphere, Corpse Party is one of those games that kept me guessing what was going to happen next, and made me actually care about the characters. I will warn you though that it might occasionally freak you out, especially if you're foolhardy like me who tried playing it at night.", "timestamp_created": 1462151146, "timestamp_updated": 1462151146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.724373", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22747897": {"recommendationid": "22747897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255270022", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474854492}, "language": "english", "review": "It helped me finally butter up my pooper and I know it'll help you too!", "timestamp_created": 1462126408, "timestamp_updated": 1462126408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522727", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22728557": {"recommendationid": "22728557", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170869499", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462058469}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoyed this game.

In my opinion, the sprites are creepier than the PSP version due to how deformed they look.\n\nI really wanted to like the PC version of Corpse Party, and i'll probably give it more time to settle in, but as it stands, the game just seems like a shadow of its former glorious cousin, the PSP version of Blood Covered.", "timestamp_created": 1462025625, "timestamp_updated": 1462025625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522727", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22719313": {"recommendationid": "22719313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042798748", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510359533}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]It has finally arrived\u2026 The long awaited Corpse Party for PC is now here on Steam![/h1]\n\n[h1]Note![/h1]\nPlease keep in mind that this is not the PSP version.\n\n[h1]Another note:[/h1]\nAlso keep in mind that Corpse Party is not for the faint-hearted. If you\u2019re not a big fan of horror games then I don't suggest getting it.\n\n\nI\u2019ve been a fan of Corpse Party for a while, and seeing this on Steam only brings me more nostalgia ever since I\u2019ve seen Corpse Party for the first time. Even though it's not as spectacular as the PSP version in my opinion (which came out after this was made by the way), it still brings out quite the experience and will still give you shivers down your spine.\n\nThe full name, Corpse Party: Blood Covered is an RPG Horror game developed by Team GrisGris and localized into English by XSEED Games. \n\nThe story starts out with students at a school called Kisaragi Academy. They are Ayumi Shinozaki, Yoshiki Kishinuma, Satoshi Mochida, Yuka Mochida, Naomi Nakashima, Seiko Shinohara, Mayu Suzumoto, Sakutaro Morishige, and Ms. Yui Shishido, and they are about to become the new victims of the supposed haunted elementary school, Heavenly Host.\n\nAyumi, who is into horror and occults, decides to do a ritual called the \u201cSachiko Ever After\u201d because of her friend, Mayu leaving Kisaragi and transferring to another school. After the ritual has been done, Ayumi claims that they all would always be friends\u2026 That is until a sudden earthquake occurs and the ground collapses beneath them, causing the whole crew to fall into the abyss below\u2026 [spoiler]At least that's what I assume for this version.[/spoiler]\n\nCorpse Party consists of 5 chapters, which is the main storyline for the characters. As you progress the story will get more intense and (maybe) more gruesome and frightening as you play. There are also 4 extra chapters, which are exclusive to this version including one chapter which re-tells the storyline from Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, \u201cTooth\u201d chapter. The story is still the same, but when compared to the PSP version, the dialogue is different, including having different voice actors for the characters and not having it fully voiced, but this game still has its charm to the core. There are even some some minor scenes like the prologue that are very different compared to the PSP version, but it doesn't really change or impact the storyline in any way.\n\n[spoiler]You can also find and collect name tags of the victims\u2019 corpses that are scattered throughout the school and even find out the causes of their deaths. (Hence the name Corpse Party, hehehe\u2026 Okay I'll stop.)[/spoiler]\n\nNote that this game is very dialogue heavy, similar to how a visual novel would stand out. So unless you like reading or if you're patient, expect more than just a paragraph of reading. This game also contains multiple endings, one good / true ending per chapter, and multiple bad endings (Only one ending for the extra chapters). You will be given decisions that might either save your fate or cause a traumatic ending for them all depending on the many different outcomes. Make your decisions carefully and wisely. [spoiler]That\u2019s why there are save points![/spoiler]\n\nThe soundtrack is also spectacular to listen to. There will be some moments where you feel like you\u2019re pumped for action and ready to embrace the horrors of Heavenly Host, or maybe some moments where it makes you really shake.\n\nNow the part I really like about Corpse Party is how it brings most, if not, all of the horror elements together into one. Unlike most basic horror games I've seen which mainly only focuses on jumpscares, Corpse Party does much more than that. This is one of the only games I played that literally frightened me to the point where my heart was pumping, body tensed up and at the edge of my seat like if I was in a helpless situation. This is truly a masterpiece when it comes to horror.\n\nThe characters are all-so-lovable as always considered by many fans. [spoiler]Oh good o\u2019 Seiko, we will miss you. :( [/spoiler] That\u2019s one of the reasons why the fanbase is popular, because of the interesting characters, their development, and their relationships with one another. You will learn to either love or hate these characters and this entirely depends on the outcomes of the many different endings you might get.\n\nIn conclusion, Corpse Party is a well done horror game that also well optimised for PC, never encountered any issues. Even though it has its flaws, it still shines in a unique way compared to the PSP version with its unique and some extra content that is exclusive to the PC version.\n\nIt also comes with its own set of trading cards so you could get your Corpse Party theme badges, emoticons, backgrounds, etc.\n\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n\nFan of horror? Sure! Like the series? Definitely! Into extreme blood, gore, and violence? Then this is for you.\n\nIf you really liked this game, then I also recommend playing the rest of the series if you haven't already, the 2 games, Corpse Party: Book of Shadows and Corpse Party: Blood Drive as well.\n\n9.5 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1462008624, "timestamp_updated": 1462008904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 77, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.803299", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22716335": {"recommendationid": "22716335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153474140", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477534929}, "language": "english", "review": "SACHIKO WE BEG OF YOU!

No... this game will MAKE YOU imaginate all the bad and disgusting situation that the characters are experiencing, the text is very descriptive and dense.

Unfortunately, it pales in comparison to the PSP remakes, which surpasses the PC version in animation and voice acting (makes dialogue so much lively), potraits (makes characters more realisticly high school), CG (critical for emotional scenes). The only area where the PC version is better is the headphone audio, which is definitely more chilling and better recorded.\nI bought this game, but then I discovered the PSP version, and I just couldn't look at the PC version anymore.\nStill, I'm not asking for refunds, just to support high quality VNs on PC, but I recommend the PSP versions far more (the upcoming 3ds version will be the definite version).\n\nAs for the game itself, its a very slow boiling horror story, it takes advantage of the long play time to lure players to invest emotional commitment to their characters before some are killed off. The results are far more terrifying than your typical gorefest, not to mention it explores deeper themes than simple creepy stories, meaning you'll remember the story for far longer than the likes of Alan Wake or Before Dawn or any Resident Evils (if that can still be considered a horror game)", "timestamp_created": 1461919143, "timestamp_updated": 1461919143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.999537", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22698852": {"recommendationid": "22698852", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073781632", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465066331}, "language": "english", "review": "Although at the time of this review I've only completed the first chapter, I can tell you right now that I absolutely love this game. I've done all the other Corpse Party games and this PC version is pretty much just as good as the PsP version. The soundtrack seems a little bit different but still fantastic as always. The story is the same as the PsP version, obviously. So that's as good as ever. The only real complaint I have is the complete lack of artwork from the PsP version, instead they used the real old artwork from the PC 98. I'm aware this is because of licensing issues but it still takes away from the game a little bit, in my opinion at least. If you're going to play this I have to recommend also playing the rest of the games as well. Blood Drive and Book of Shadows. At least watch them, if you aren't going to play them. There's plenty of people on the internet who have it on YouTube. You can also play/watch Repeated fear which has the more updated graphics and other visuals. I know Cry did a really great playthrough of that game if you can't find a decent playthrough.There's also a few Anime bits to go along with the series like Missing Footage but they aren't really neccesary. I very highy recommend this game to anyone, really.

Yes, it looks more... primitive than the PSP. Yes, the artstyle is different and more childish. And yes, it's not fully voiced unlike Blood Covered: Repeated Fear, but bear in mind that the PSP version is an enhanced remake of this one game, which is in turn a remake of a PC-98 game from 1996 (Remakeception pretty much). \nNot having the still images the PSP version had, the PC version mostly counts on two factors to spook you out: hearing and imagination. The voice clips and sound effects are bone-chilling, maybe even more than on the PSP, and the gory descriptions are just as accurate and grotesque (Both versions are translated by XSEED, after all, so there are plenty of bits where dialogues and descriptions are identical between the two versions). \nIf we add the game running at smooth 60 FPS, the overall clearer (albeit a bit less detailed) tilesets and THANKFULLY the option of skipping pre-read text, well... you can see why I strongly advice buying this game...\n... well... unless you're those people who don't like reading... or prefer seeing gorefests directly on-screen off to the last detail!

It revolves around a group of kids being trapped into an otherworldly elemntary school which back in the 1970s harbored incidents involving missing children. The characters have been split up and must find a way out.

Thats a hard question to answer, now the game is incredible and always has been in terms of gameplay and story telling, but there is one feature that puts me off, now alot of corpse party fans will have played the psp remake of the original 2008 corpse party, corpse party: repeated fear, now the remake was superior, adding voice acting, extra features, improved art and CGs, CGs being my favourite cause they were gory and horrid and really added to the descriptions, but your planning on buying this expecting a port of repeated fear, then dont, this a port of the original 2008, no updated art, and no CGs, but voice acting has been included, now ive just finished chapter 1, getting the 3 endings and really miss the CG, which is starting to put me off, but apart from that, yes it still has the whole potential in storytelling, also the skip text option, victims lists etc are a nice touch, if only there was an option to switch between original and remaster, then that would be great, but the psp version is far superior, therefore i leave myself forced to not reccomend this game to those who have played the psp version, but to give this a try if you havent played a corpse party game yet", "timestamp_created": 1461610633, "timestamp_updated": 1461610633, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 98, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537238", "comment_count": "39", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22634476": {"recommendationid": "22634476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111654908", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476511108}, "language": "english", "review": "So happy.

Once you get used to them, they become charming in their own way and are more than bearable. In fact, in some parts of the game they shine more than the updated psp versions.\n\nNow for the actual game:\n\nThe story is simple, you are trapped in an unknown place, by an unknown force, Heavenly host elementary being that place. The setting is dark and grim with very adult themes and little to no rest on intense dialogue and scenes.\n\nAs I stated before, once you get used to the art, it almost becomes more enjoyable than its psp's counter part.\n\nThe gameplay is very dialogue heavy, but allows for exploration at your own pace, creeping around the old elementary, not really being sure what to expect around each turn. With the absolutely stunning soundtrack it will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time.\n\nAlmost all of the decision you make will make a difference, with many different outcomes to ALMOST all of the scenarios you encounter. So if you favor a character, make your decisions carefully.\n\nThe pacing of this game might be considered a little slow for some people, but if you like VN style pacing, it will be perfect for you.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nPROs:\n\n- Unique and engaging art and dialogue\n\n- Decision heavy and very interactive\n\n- Stunning soundtrack\n\n- Fantastic setting\n\n- Great pacing\n\n- Edge of your seat story with many lovable characters\n\n- Multiple endings and lots of little extras\n\nCONs:\n\n- The controller support feels a little \"off\" when using a analog stick on a 360 pad, it almost feels a little too sensitive, however the dpad works great.\n\n- Letterboxing with black borders\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n(as of release day I can't find any other initial faults)\n\nIf you are familiar with the 2008 version and want to play it in English, this is perfect for you.\n\nIf you have played the psp version and want to spice things up a bit with some extra content and original dialogue, give it a go also.\n\nOverall I'm impressed by the launch, it runs flawlessly and I have encountered no serious issues.", "timestamp_created": 1461609270, "timestamp_updated": 1461617569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 271, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.930412", "comment_count": "27", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22634245": {"recommendationid": "22634245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056666213", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483661289}, "language": "english", "review": "I have enjoyed this franchise for a long time now and I am excited for it to come to Steam.

I have both played the Dead Space series and Corpse Party and I have been very suprised how pixel horror and strong narrative has spooked me far more than Dead Space ever has; Dont be fooled by its lackluster graphics.

No me gusta comparar juegos entre juegos, pero para ser mas claro que tipo de juego es, digamos que es una mezcla de \" The Legend of Zelda \" y \" Tales of ( Saga ) \", hasta puedo decir que un poco de \" Secret of mana \".

You die, you start again at the beginning of the fight \u2014 and after, what, 4 hours, it was still incredible fun. \n\n\nI can't wait to play Origins.", "timestamp_created": 1505922731, "timestamp_updated": 1506954013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591718", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35028821": {"recommendationid": "35028821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074690200", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 1369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500414716}, "language": "english", "review": "I was very hesitant about buying this game at first because of all the Reviews complaining about artificial difficulty, which badly reminded me of Dark Souls II and it's horrible \"LOL U DIED PRAISE THE SON XD SO HARD\"-marketing campaign. Luckily I can say that this game is nothing like Dark Souls II (except for the marketing campaign which thinks that difficulty is a good selling point and a \"consult and FAQ already XDDD\" achievement are funny) and I really cannot understand all the reviews complaining about this game being unnecessarily hard. I played on normal, which I think is the intended difficulty and I never had a problem with artifical difficulty the only thing that I can think of that comes close, is that the hitbox of one of the 2nd boss' attacks is b\u00fcllshit when he's in his last phase. The dungeons themselves are pretty easy, thanks to the carefully placed save points, but the Bosses are the real challenge. The Bossfights are hard but always fair. This game really forces you to learn all the patterns of every boss in and out. If you don't know how to deal with an attack of a boss, you're dead. That's it. You can't afford to not know how to deal with all of the enemies attacks, as this game has no healing during bossfights, meaning that if you take damage, you will have to continue with your reduced health for the rest of the fight. One thing that always annoyed me about Dark Souls (even though I really like Dark Souls, or at least the first half of it) is that you always had to make a \"corpse run\" from the last bonfire to a boss and while this mechanic is okay the first few times, after a while it gets really tedious and loses its point of making you learn the level. This game doesn't have that, you restart the fight instantly and can die as many times as you want without any penalty or downside. You can learn the boss' patterns as long as it takes you, even if it takes you 100 tries. This game doesn't really put an emphasis on this but you really, really need to carefully scan your environments for loot because having the best possible equipment at all times is key to victory. This also means that you should constantly keep your equipment upgraded to max. Regarding the story, it's about as cliche as it get's and while all the characters are likeable, they have about as much depth as a puddle. But still, the story does it's job and doesn't get in the way of the gameplay. The soundtrack however is an absolute masterpiece, it fits all the situations perfectly, gets you pumped up and just sounds great. As for the controls, I strongly encourage setting the magic button to one of the shoulder buttons as that way it's much easier to charge magic and use your sword at the same time. Otherwise they're perfectly fine, every button is rebindable and you can chose which connected controller you want to use. The graphics are dated but the pre-rendered sprites look great and allow for some detailed enemy designs, also this probably runs on a toaster.\n\nOverall I would give this game a solid 8.5 out of 10", "timestamp_created": 1505668931, "timestamp_updated": 1505669251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528671", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34963846": {"recommendationid": "34963846", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991157647", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478746174}, "language": "english", "review": "I gotta admit, this is a game I grew up playing on the SNES, although at the time I believe it was called Wanderer's of YS 3 and not Oath of Felghana. I always worry whenever a game gets switched to an isometric or 3d playstyle from a 2d side scroller but this one was perfectly executed. They captured the same challenges as the first game, the movement and combat are fluid even jumping around. I do admit that the ring system on the SNES version gave you a few more abilities you could use opposed to what we have now but I also understand their design decision because they were going for a more action packed, fast to play game style.\n\nIt all worked well. I mean I admit my first playthrough picking hard difficulty may not have been the best choice. I raged, oh boy did I rage LOL. But I won! That satisfying feeling of winning something really difficult can't be beat. That is what the developers did right with this remake. They captured that satisfying feeling of victory with fast, action packed gameplay that didn't depend on game design that punishes you for 'dying' by making you waste time backtracking. You die? Jump right back in and try again gives it that arcade feeling where you get addicted and just keep putting in those quarters until you finally win and shout YES! WOOHOO! I'M AWESOME!\n\nI have absolutely no complaints about the gameplay at all. If you don't like your games to be difficult, this isn't the game for you. If you appreciate a challenge and feel the victory of overcoming such challenges is a sweet reward, you will love this.\n\nAs far as the story goes? Well I had to install some mod to get the voice acting from the PSP working here. I really liked the voice acting and the story overall is pretty good. It's really your stereotypical hero who conquors evil with some really nice twists. I can't call it the most riveting story ever told but it is absolutely enjoyable, at least to me.\n\nAlso the music... wow. The composer did a fantastic job with the music score in this game. It's so blood pumping and at times emotional and makes up some of the best music I've heard in the industry actually. \n\nThe Art style? Well it's an isometric 2d style, top down camera, pixel art and level design giving the illusion of 3d but I can really appreciate this style it's colorful and creative.\n\nLastly, the level design. Many of it feels maze-like with some hidden secrets. They did a pretty good job capturing that old school level design we appreciated on the SNES game. But it isn't so maze-like that you can find yourself lost and going around in circles constantly.\n\nYs: The Oath of Felghana is a masterful recreation of the SNES game Wanderer's of YS 3 and i've enjoyed every minute I spent in this game thoroughly and will continue to support Xseed's future YS projects.", "timestamp_created": 1505449773, "timestamp_updated": 1505449773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499550", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34913602": {"recommendationid": "34913602", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970513770", "num_games_owned": 1190, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505279351}, "language": "english", "review": "Review is listed here.

Die aktuell auf Steam verf\u00fcgbaren Spiele k\u00f6nnen in beliebiger Reihe gespielt werden, Vorkenntnisse sind nicht erforderlich.\n\nYs Oath in Felghana ist ein Remake von Ys III, welches in einer mittelalterlichen Fantasywelt spielt. Der reisende Abenteurer Adol kommt in Felghana an, w\u00e4hrend sich gerade eine neue Krise in diesem kleinen Reich anbahnt. Und so muss er (fast) im Alleingang dieses Reich retten.\nFokus des Spiels sind Dungeons mit schnellen K\u00e4mpfe und harten Bossk\u00e4mpfen, die nur wenige Fehler verzeihen. Aber auch Story, einfache R\u00e4tsel und Sprungpassagen bietet das Spiel. \n\nWas gef\u00e4llt mir an dem Spiel:\n- Actionreihe, gegnergef\u00fcllte Dungeons voller Action\n- Optionale Sch\u00e4tze und versteckte Sidequests\n- Actionreiche mitreisende Musik\n- Jump and Run Passagen, welche zum Teil an Sidescroller anlehnt sind.\n- Fordernde Bossek\u00e4mpfe, welche \u00dcbung,Reaktionsschnelligkeit und Vorbereitung verlangen.\n- Man muss wenig grinden, sofern man alle Gegner die man sieht niederm\u00e4ht. Das Spiel l\u00e4sst sich in weniger als 10 Stunden durchspielen. Muss man doch mal f\u00fcr einen Bosskampf kurz grinden, ist das in 10 Minuten erledigt.\n- Gelungenes Magiesystem mit 3 Elementen, welche alle Ihre Verwendung finden.\n- Gute Geschichte, gibt aber nicht mit Final Fantasy X oder Trails in the Sky zu vergleichen\n\nWas gef\u00e4llt mir weniger:\n- Die Grafik ist etwas altbacken, Die Artworks sind zwar nicht pixelg, k\u00f6nnten aber eine noch h\u00f6here Aufl\u00f6sung vertragen.\n- Die Nebencharactere bleiben eher blass, sind aber auch nicht der Fokus des Spiels.\n\nFalls man noch nie Ys gespielt hat, sollte man auf maximal auf dem Schwierigkeitsgrad Normal anfangen. Wer sich unsicher ist, kann auch Easy w\u00e4hlen. Wenn man Ys schon kennt, wei\u00df man jedenfalls bereits was einen erwartet. Ein Gamepad ist empfehlenswert. \n\nFazit: Wer eine schnelle actionreiche Herausforderung sucht ist bei diesem Spiel genau richtig.

The music is awesome and memorable. Bosses, however, single-handedly put all that is good about the game to waste.\n\nI certainly don't mind hard games, but too often it is artificial, particularly on the higher difficulty levels. To set the tone: Bosses generally kill you in 2-4 hits with spammy attacks that are very difficult to dodge, have a lot of health and provide VERY limited (and generally dangerous) vulnerability windows. Most of this is fine, though their health can get absurdly excessive at times and certain attacks have questionable hit boxes.\n\nThe problem is that some boss' attacks are decided by RNG and can become impossible (in the literal rather than exaggerating sense) to survive. If Gyalva wants to turn the arena into spikes forever and shoot you when you can't dodge, or if Istersiva wants to repeatedly spit out three laser-crystals until they fill the screen, there's genuinely no chance to win.\n\nThese are not controlled in any way; apparently the developers' idea of justifying this is the accessibility of the Retry button that appears when you die.\n\nThe need to compensate for often unavoidable damage means that, with rare exception on the highest difficulties, bosses become an aggravating marathon of perfection-demanding frustration that you would expect to see in a badly-balanced bullet hell. It is no small irony that the reliance on scripted attacks makes what is meant to be a tough final boss one of the easiest in the game.\n\nThe alternative is to spend an hour (again, not an exaggeration) before many bosses to grind a couple of levels extra, which dramatically reduces the damage you receive and makes them pitifully easy. To sum up the choices, you can beat your head against a wall or you can bore yourself to tears. Both options can only be considered anti-fun.\n\nA far less critical issue is the controls: 3 buttons switch between and use magic, but there are only 3 different magics so they could have just got a button each. XInput support is lacking; controllers work but cannot be remapped. Xbox controllers access the menu with the right stick, while magic use (X) and jump (B) make life awkward as they are often needed together. There are also multiple complaints that jump button presses sometimes fail to register.\n\nBut this is a minor flaw compared to the boss problem, which could have been prevented. This is a Steam re-release of the original 2005 PC version. In 2010, the game received a PSP port which made a considerate reworking of bosses and provided a double-boost ability. None of that made it into the Steam release in 2012, and an otherwise great game suffers irredeemably for it.", "timestamp_created": 1490739741, "timestamp_updated": 1491529697, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483944", "comment_count": "19", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30793344": {"recommendationid": "30793344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260262238", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 427, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493464586}, "language": "schinese", "review": "boss\u6218\u597d\u6076\u5fc3", "timestamp_created": 1490708975, "timestamp_updated": 1490708975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30694267": {"recommendationid": "30694267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043214842", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 4852, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500839756}, "language": "english", "review": "By far one of the best games I've ever had the pleasure of playing.  And as a big fan of Ys in general, I consider this to be the best of the series.  As with the rest of the Ys series, the world is built wonderfully.  Every area in the game feels very unique and interesting.  Every character in the game also has their own name, portrait, and a bit of personal character to them, no matter how insignificant their role is.  I've always found this to be a wonderful attribute to the Ys series, and makes character interactions feel more intimate and special than what you get in many RPGs.\n\nThe gameplay is also top notch in Felghana.  Each area is laid out very well and presents a challenge to overcome.  The bosses are also incredibly well designed, and some of the best I've seen in any game.  Boss battles are fast-paced and challenging, and despite the high difficulty, everything feels completely fair.  Every single attack is avoidable through practice, skill, and reflexes, no matter how ridiculous they may seem at first, which is something I absolutely love to see in my games.  While I highly recommend playing on the highest difficulty for Ys games to really get your blood pumping, there are also several easier settings for more casual players who aren't as good at fast paced action games, offering something for everyone.\n\nGraphically, the game looks great.  Despite being pretty old (original Japanese PC release in 2005), the visual design and artstyle were done very well.  The colors, lighting, animations, models, and so on all just look fantastic, and I feel they'll hold up well forever.  Falcom just did a great job there.\n\nThe music is wonderful too.  Falcom games always have top notch music, and Felghana is no different.  They really did a good job with the soundtrack.  Unfortunately, unlike the PSP release, the Steam release doesn't have the option to change to the alternate soundtracks from the PC88 or X68000 versions of Wanderers of Ys, but this is a minor complaint that shouldn't matter much except to enthusiasts of the sound from those old machines.  The Windows soundtrack is phenominal to be sure.\n\nThis game is just so good and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes fun.", "timestamp_created": 1490308799, "timestamp_updated": 1490308799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30645793": {"recommendationid": "30645793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050349684", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489454434}, "language": "english", "review": "My Z key hates this game, poor guy dindt make it", "timestamp_created": 1490067095, "timestamp_updated": 1490067095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500390", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30629120": {"recommendationid": "30629120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186450505", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489358773}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc5d8\ub808\ub098\ucc21\uc774 \ub108\ubb34 \uc774\ubed0\uc11c 1\ub530\ubd09", "timestamp_created": 1489981432, "timestamp_updated": 1489981432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30616098": {"recommendationid": "30616098", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974301588", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496404563}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc774\uc2a43\ub97c \ub9ac\uba54\uc774\ud06c\ud55c \ud6cc\ub96d\ud55c \uc791\ud488\uc774\ub2e4.\n\uc815\uc2dd\ud55c\uae00\ud654\uac00 \uc548\ub41c\uac8c \uc544\uc27d\uae30\ub294 \ud558\ub098 \ud55c\uae00\ud328\uce58\ub3c4 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc5ec \ud070 \uc7a5\uc560\uac00 \ub418\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4.\n\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac \ub3c4 \ud6cc\ub96d\ud558\uace0 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d\ub3c4 \uad1c\ucc2e\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1489932098, "timestamp_updated": 1489932098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30533955": {"recommendationid": "30533955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119660771", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 2102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 531, "last_played": 1515371659}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't think too much about it when people said this game was difficult, therefore setting the difficulty high seemed okay.

Bosses all test your ability to the fullest in memorizing patterns, utilizing your new magic, and waiting for the opportune moment to strike. The music like anything JDK Falcom composes is beyond words. Often times this soundtrack is regarded as the best in the series while I personally feel like Chronicles is the best for me. As for the story, the game is pretty basic with its plot however, it has a lot of world building for both the previous and newer installments. These are nods to those that have played the other games of the series and nothing major is revealed with these events. It is a self contained story like most of the series except Ys I+II Chronicles, so you don't need to play the previous games to understand the story. A few tips for those that will be playing this game for the first time. Note that this game is a lot harder than most entries in the series. Normal mode will be more difficult than you are used to. Do not be discouraged. As I had played other games in the series I thought that I would start in Hard Mode and got my ass kicked. You can beat it through trial and error and grinding until you can beat the boss, Other than that, I highly reccomend the game for its fast pace, fun combat and soundtrack. 10/10",

They aren't difficult to fight against, but they always have some stupid gimick to work around, like having a shield you have to wait out, or literally spending 90% of the fight outside of the map shooting at you from where you can't even fight back. Another massive drawback to the boss fights is how often you can count on getting hit by an attack that has clearly missed, or getting hit by an attack even after its animation has ended.

So you can tell there are some refinements.\n\nFirst, instead of 3 different swords, you get the traditional weapon system from Ys 1 and 2, and the elemental attacks are replaced with three different magic rings. Fire Magic works pretty much the same as Ys 2, while the added Earth Magic and Wind Magic add another layer to your combat. Ys 6 lacked distance attacks and good way to mob enemies, while this provides just that. Earth Magic can be used to charge towards or away from enemies, which also provides another layer to combat. Overall, unlike Ys 6 where Brillante was pretty much the only sword you ever used, here, you find yourself using the three magics more or less balanced. There are also a lot of enemies that behave differently, especially the jumpers who make it harder to spam down stab like you always did in Ys 6, and some enemies requiring a specific magic to get through them easily, so the combat is overall an improvement, probably more than it initialy seems. The bosses are pretty fun too, though Ys 6 had good ones as well. As far as the final boss goes, this one trumps Ys 6's big time. Main combo being 6 hits instead of 3 also helps.\n\nThe dungeon design is, because Ys 3 was originally a sidescroller, flat, but in a good way. This makes the design a lot more comprehensible, and added with MUCH better platforming mechanic (no dash jumps, but also very forgiving gliding technic), it makes the dungeon design just much better. Of course, it's no Zelda, but then again, Zelda is built around dungen puzzles, while this game is about hacking away at your enemies, so it's not a fair comparison.\n\nThe problem is then the scale. There is only one village, and 32 NPCs. There are 6 dungeons, which I think is actually the same number as Ys 6, but it's overworld (if you can call it that) is pitifully small. As in, smaller than Ys 1. So if you are expecting Ys 2-esque, legit RPG with lots of characters to interact with, you are not going to get it here.

Combat is fluid and challenging, boss fights tough and engaging, story is adequate, and NPCs have personality and react to plot developments. If you've played Ys 1 and 2 and enjoyed them as I did, know that this third entry in the series is actually better in every way. Newcomers can feel free to start here because it's a standalone adventure.\n\nThe hero, Adol, is a swordsman who lives for the thrill of exploring new lands. In each game, he arrives at a new place, meets lots of people, earns their admiration for solving their problems and saving their lives, gets a girl to fall in love with him, and then leaves it all behind at the end to travel somewhere else. In terms of gameplay, Felghana has you platforming and hacking and slashing your way through varied environments (dungeons) filled with monsters, while trying to find treasure chests on your way to the next save point, after which there is a boss fight. It follows this formula all throughout -- simple and it works. You also have to keep an eye out for a few secret passages and a couple side quests if you want to get all the unique items in this game, some of which are incredibly useful in avoiding headaches later on. The soundtrack, as always in this series, is very good.\n\nThe main draw here is definitely the hectic combat, and the satisfying difficulty of the bosses is the height of what the game has to offer. The dungeon chests add an enjoyable exploration element, the story does a good job giving meaning to what you're doing, and the personable and reactive NPCs make you care about what's happening. Overall, Felghana is a very well put together package and a polished experience. Easy recommendation for anyone who likes what they see in the gameplay videos.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1479196920, "timestamp_updated": 1479196920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26583876": {"recommendationid": "26583876", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011552262", "num_games_owned": 426, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 5792, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1515548636}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy this if you REALLY hate walls~\n\nOne of the best games in the entire Ys series, stay away from the garbage Vita sequels.", "timestamp_created": 1479053115, "timestamp_updated": 1479053115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503876", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26468402": {"recommendationid": "26468402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200702853", "num_games_owned": 386, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478470457}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u66fe\u73a9\u8fc7\u7684\u8001\u73a9\u5bb6\uff0c\u70b9\u8d5e\u5c31\u884c\u4e86\u3002\n\u6ca1\u73a9\u8fc7\u7684\u65b0\u73a9\u5bb6\uff0c\u4e70\u4e86\u5c31\u5bf9\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1478486891, "timestamp_updated": 1478486891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 129, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.913195", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26413231": {"recommendationid": "26413231", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049428677", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509543616}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 , \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e \u043a  \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0448\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u044b\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c. \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b \u0434\u0436\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a \u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430 . \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0434\u0436\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0435\u0448\u044c . \n\nhttps://youtu.be/C8BWDZ10Oto", "timestamp_created": 1478252408, "timestamp_updated": 1478252408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26354057": {"recommendationid": "26354057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159683761", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504991169}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoy the Ys series and Ys III: Wonders from Ys or rather in this case Oath in Felghana is one of my favorites in the Ys series.This version is similar to the version on the Playstation Vita or PSP with only on minor differance....No voice acting!

I'd say this game is more action than RPG. It has elements of SHMUPs. It even has some light platforming elements.\n\nPros:\n+ Very responsive controls and movement. There's no sense of sluggishness when you move, jump, and attack.\n+ Fast paced action, favoring execution, reaction, and enemy pattern recognition over grinding and slower-paced strategic / tactical decisions. More like a SHMUP than a strategic action RPG.\n+ aforementioned reaction-based elements are actually possible (at least for me in my late-20s). I've played games that have patterns that require unfeasible reaction speeds. So the patterns end up being, effectively, random amounts of damage because there's no reasonable way to avoid them (like the last boss in YS 1).\n+ The way you get good at fighting the enemies and bosses in this game is by learning their patterns. As far as I can tell, there are very few situations where your ability to win or lose is based on randomness. There are some games where there's really difficult patterns or challenges that are so difficult that you won't be able to reasonably overcome them without spending a lot of time practicing. Take some of the bosses in the souls series - the process of learning each boss's moves can take quite awhile because they have a varied moveset, and there's often complications like cluttered level design and certain patterns that can't consistently be parried or dodged or predicted. That sort of stuff really frustrates me, especially when it takes awhile to get back to the boss. This game doesn't really have anything like that. You can pretty much learn the correct thing to do in any given situation in a reasonable amount of time, and it's very consistent. And, when you fail a boss, you can restart right at it without having to make your way back from a save point. To sum it up, I think that you can feasibly learn to fight every boss without taking any damage.\n+ Difficulty options! Easy mode felt fun and not all that challenging for me. If you really want to play more you can replay on harder difficulty modes.\n+ awesome music. Energetic, electric guitar, drums, + symphonic instruments. I believe the tracks use actual recordings and not samples.\n+ World building. As you return to town during your adventures, the characters in town always have different things to say. It's nice when games don't have voice acting because it lets writers write a lot more stuff, and they've definitely taken advantage of that fact here.\n\nThings I didn't like:\n- towards the end, it seems there's a bit of an expectation that you grind to get more money and EXP so you can upgrade your gear, increase your max HP, and increase your stats. If you think that's okay, ask yourself if running back and forth between the same rooms doing the same repetitive task just to make some numbers go up is a really meaningful way to spend your life. Ask yourself if you'd go to bed feeling good about how you spent your day, having spent hours of it doing the same stupid task over and over again.\n- overall, the grinding for EXP, money, and upgrade mats I think needlessly lengthens the game and gets in the way of the action-oriented gameplay. I hardly had to spend much time grinding, but I wonder what including stats and levels and stuff really achieves, from the perspective of just making the game fun. I think it hurts the fun.\n- Partial controller support. You cannot map the menu button to a button on your controller. You have to have your keyboard there in front of you or you have to use an external tool to map your start button to ESC.\n\nIn short, there's not much I didn't like about this game. It's a nice, fast-paced action game with some JRPG elements. Although, I can't help but wonder what a game like this has to offer over actual \"action-first\" action games like Bayonetta, DMC, SHMUPs, etc...I feel like the thing that makes this game unique is its inclusion of JRPG elements, but I also feel like the game may have been more fun if it had just focused all on the action. The primary gameplay of this game is action-oriented, but if that's what you really want out of a game you have much better options elsewhere. The action in this game isn't as great as the action in other highly-polished action games. So why not just play those instead?\n\nSo, if you have no shortage of top-tier action games that you still enjoy (like Platinum games that you haven't yet 100%'d), I don't know that this game is worth getting.

It was the first in the series to swap from the top-down bump system to a 2D platformer. It was also outsourced to many, many different devs and systems. The series later swapped back to their original system for Ys IV (And presumably V) and then started using a 3D platformer engine for VI and beyond.\n\nYet this is my favorite in the series.\nOath in Felghana is a 1st-party remake of the original. With remixed music, completely redone areas, and superior gameplay. I would honestly list this among my top 5 RPGs of all time.\n\n[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]\nYs TOiF is an Action RPG/Hack&Slash 3D platformer. You have four main abilities. Obviously: Attack combo, Jump, and Magic. But you also have a boost, which charges over time, gives you a quicker, stronger combo, and halves all damage taken. (In the PSP version you get a second boost which also gives HP Regen.) There are plenty of moves, like plunging attacks, rising blades, and such. The gameplay is generally very fast-paced. Grinding is made easier with a combo system that awards an XP multiplier based on how long you can keep a combo going.\nThis game is VERY hard. You shouldn't have too much trouble beating it on normal, but I'm currently in the midst of an Inferno mode playthrough. Dodging attacks is very necessary, though you get an ability later that negates all damage and serves as a guard.\nOne of the game's strong points is it's boss fights. All challenging, tense, and require a dedication of learning patterns and when to attack (Especially in higher difficulties). You really feel accomplished when you beat them.\n\n[b]MUSIC[/b]\nOooohhhmygodthisgamehasamazingmusic.\nFalcom loves putting metal remixes of the original songs in their games. I'm serious when I say that literally every song on this soundtrack is amazing. Please just give it a listen even if you don't want to play the game. It always fits with the area perfectly.\n\n[b]STORY[/b]\nThis game picks up a few years after Ys II leaves off. Monsters are still rapant even though demons and magic have been eradicated. And a small trading town is hurt severely by the rule of a tyrant noble. It's a pretty decent story, and the intended emotions towards all of the characters get carried over very well.\n\nOverall, I love this game. It's one of my favorites of all time, and likely the best in the series.\n9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1472775233, "timestamp_updated": 1472775233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25279227": {"recommendationid": "25279227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107182741", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1597, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494343763}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're looking for a starightforward action RPG with amazing music, tight controls, and satisfying combat (especially bosses), this should be a go-to.\n\nThere really aren't very many flaws in the game, aside from the game not looking amazing and some weak plot here and there.\n\nBut this can be pretty easily overlooked with how fun the hack-and slash combat is.

There is plenty of new content that wasn't in the original, and all of it improves upon the old foundation.\n\nIf I had to suggest improvements, I'd ask that the easy mode was a little bit less easy (maybe 2/3rds damage instead of half damage from enemies. There is an included \"Very Easy\" mode after all.) Normal mode required a bit more dying, grinding, or perfect pattern memorization than I'd prefer, and bosses often had a few moves that seemed to be unavoidable.

It is one of your more standard JPRGs. There's a lot of grinding involved and a lot of back tracking as well. Ys is one of those RPGs that don't always tell you where you need to go or what to do. Most of the game's story progress is based on in game events, so you may find yourself wandering around and then having to back track in order to actually get anywhere.\n\nAs a standard JRPG there isn't anything too bad about it, the graphics are good, for it's age, it has a decent sound track and there's some very nice hand drawn animation as well.

Gameplay is simple, but fun and addicting. You will grind like in RPG's, but will have some platforming too.

Felghana is a very challenging action-RPG game. While the story and RPG elements are quite basic, everything else is just great. Fast, action oriented gameplay with fluid controls along with epic soundtrack makes you feel like a badass while fighting through numerous monsters and unique boss fights. The bosses are varied and there are lots of them. Learning their patterns and patience is key to success here. After you beat certain difficult boss and your heart is still beating like crazy, you get that same great feeling like beating a boss in Dark Souls. Make sure you also try Time Attack mode after you finish the game!\n\nThis was my first YS game and I played through it on Normal difficulty and had a tough time in certain parts of the game. If you are newcomer to the series I recommend starting with either Very Easy or Easy difficulty.

actually  don't remember anythign about it so playing Ys: The Oath in Felghana was like playing Ys games for the first time.\n\nwhen i bought the game i didn't know what to expect i usually drop single players games when i play on pc after a couple of hours because i'm lazy and i prefer play online\n\nHowever for this game was an other story, i Loved every single moment of it, the gameplay is fun the artworks are great and the music is Amazing, some parts of the story were predictable but towards the end there's some surprises\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple you can walk, run, jump freely in the world and there's no random encounter, the enemies wander around the map/dungeouns and you hit him with your sword or magic, that's it, for some people it may feel like a 2d Dark Souls because most of the enemies are tough if you do not have the right equipment and of course if your Lv is low, some of them requires to learn a specific pattern or you'll get countered easily.\nFor last you should never get surrounded by enemies because there's no invincibiliy or recovery time after you get hit (unless you get Knocked down) again, it reminded me the previous mentioned dark souls just a bit\n\nThe Boss fights are tough too and some of them are hard even if you memorized the boss patters because there's so much stuff going when fighting, some felt impossible at first but after levelling 2-3 more levels you'll notice that it'll get WAY more easier than it used to be at lower level\n\ni kept gong back to this game everytime i would until i beated it, it was a fun experience and super addicting to me plus that Sountrack is so good that you'll keep revisiting previous zones just for listen to them\n\nOverall the game was amazing and i think everyoen should give it a chance, and  if you do not like it there's always a refund option.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1452276899, "timestamp_updated": 1452276899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

Adol da eore qual'\u00e8 non si lascer\u00e0 scappare l'occasione per aiutare la gente di Felghana e scoprire i segreti di questa nuova terra. Nihon Falcom decise di reinventare totalmente questo titolo ed evolvere tutto ci\u00f2 che gi\u00e0 funzionava nel gameplay di Ys VI. Abbiamo armi ed armature che possono essere temprate per maggiore efficacia, abbiamo anelli magici che potremo potenziare con le giuste gemme e una boost mode che aumenta la nostra velocit\u00e0, difesa e attacco per breve tempo. Una cosa in cui scarseggia questo titolo \u00e8 la selezione di accessori, molto pochi e necessari semplicemente per attraversare determinate zone pi\u00f9 facilmente. Il gioco \u00e8 un action RPG isometrico molto frenetico, con elementi di platforming e un personaggio molto abile e versatile nel combattimento. Di tutti i capitoli che ho giocato finora questo \u00e8 sicuramente il pi\u00f9 equilibrato dal punto di vista della difficolt\u00e0. Anche a livello normale questo gioco sa essere brutale, specialmente i boss vi metteranno alla prova duramente, analizzare i pattern \u00e8 la chiave per vincere, sfruttando tutti i tuoi attacchi e le tue magie per evitare danni il pi\u00f9 possibile, in quanto non \u00e8 possibile curarsi durante le boss fight. Come sempre il grinding pu\u00f2 aiutare, ma in questo gioco la curva di sviluppo \u00e8 molto controllata, costringendovi a tentare il tutto e per tutto contro un boss al livello consigliato piuttosto che spendere ore e ore per salire di livello. Non \u00e8 grave perch\u00e8 anche il pi\u00f9 piccolo numero in questo gioco pu\u00f2 fare la differenza: un livello, una magia pi\u00f9 potente, un armatura o un arma con un po di tempra in pi\u00f9 e la battaglia pu\u00f2 cambiare radicalmente. Ad lenire la frustrazione ci pensa soprattutto la meravigliosa soundtrack, molto trascinante e memorabile, un inno che vi rimarr\u00e0 impresso per tutta la vostra avventura.

1494757655}, "language": "english", "review": "Arguably the greatest game in the Ys series.\n\nYs takes nearly all the extraneous elements of RPGs and tosses them all out in favour of a super streamlined action battle system with some of the greatest bosses gaming has ever seen. I'm not exagerating here, Ys really does have some of gaming's greatest bosses. \n\nThere were 3 ys games to use this style of engine. The ark of Napishtim (which was the first), The oath in Felghana and finally Origins.\n\nFelghana has the greatest soundtrack of them all and arguably the second strongest soundtrack in the entire series (In a series famous for it's soundtracks (look for a psp or psvita for Ys 7 if you want the best soundtrack)).\n\nFelghana, on it's hardest difficulty has some spectacular bosses. However the game doesn't put it's best foot forward at the start. Initial bosses are pretty simple and hardly inspiring, which is unfortunate because the later bosses are absolutely spectacular. Thematically unique bosses all with their own interesting quirks and unique mechanics make each big baddy feel wholly unique and incredibly satisfying to down.\nIn fact Felghana and Origins are spectacular examples of good boss design (with a few very obnoxious exceptions).\n\nThere's also a bit of exploration and secret discovering involved in Ys, and because a number of your abilities give both combat and traversal options there is some fun platforming to be performed in the game.\n\nSo this all sounds super positive, are there any negatives then? Actually yeah, quite a few.\n\nThis game isn't pretty, I mean let's be fair it's old (2005) but that's gonna be a turn off for some people.\n\nThen there's the plot, Ys' localization is about as good as it can get (Xseed is really good at that) but this isn't a plot that's likely to do anything for you, and not much time is spent on either it or its characters.\n\nThe game is also very grind heavy, especially on it's higher difficulties. Levels and weapon upgrades in Ys make a huge difference, to the point where a single level can make your attacks do almost twice the damage and can turn some boss fights from cruel jokes into fun encounters. but there are humungous experience penalties once you start over levelling, and even then you're going to have to farm normal mooks just to avoid being underlevelled, which may have been alright except for the game's final weakness, fights that aren't bosses.\n\nYs's combat is simple, but the way it blends with each bosses unique mechanics make it incredibly satisfying. This doesn't occur with normal enemies though, which means for many, normal combat in Ys isn't very satisfying, which is unfortunate because you'll need to do a fair amount of farming basic enemies to be able to afford upgrades and avoid\nbeing underleveled.\n\nSo to sum up:\n+ Awesome soundtrack\n+ Awesome bosses after the first couple of dungeons\n\n- Not very pretty\n- Grindy on higher diffculties\n- Fighting basic enemies isn't that fun\n- Playing on easier difficulties wont let you appreciate it's great bosses properly\n\nYs will appeal extremely strongly to a certain crowd, and that crowd absolutely SHOULD play it, because it's one of the best examples of it's genre.

They're also known for their amazing rock/metal soundtracks.\n\nAs for this particular Ys game...one word: Brutal.\n\nI've played Origin, I & II, and VI on Steam and this one still annihilates me...on NORMAL. What separates most of the difficulties is simply damage caused by enemies and enemy health, and the enemy patterns can be difficult to make out after your first 10 or so attempts at a particular boss. Just a fair warning -- you need to be in the zone while playing to stand a chance...or you just need to be better than this reviewer.\n\nAside from that, it's a loose remake of Ys III, the one \"platformer\" of the series and as such, this one has a lot of platforming elements. Thanks to the fixed camera, though, the 3d platforming is pretty simple and straightforward.\n\nOne disappointment worth noting: Some PSP features like New Game+ (which itself was very minor) and refining gear up to level 9 are gone from this port.

That being said, your mileage may vary on how these games compare (how easy is is to make money, gain exp, etc.)\n\n     [*]Note 2: I will be comparing this to Origin's gameplay. Spoilers for both games will be unmarked, so please read at your discretion. \n[/list][/h1]\n\n     This is a review of the game from a technical/gameplay standpoint [b] not [/b] a review regarding the storyline, graphics, etc. I am writing this review for those that wish to play the Ys games in chronological order. \n\n     For those of you that didn't know, Origin, Oath in Felghana, and Ark of Napishtim use the same engine. However, OiF and Origin were released after Ark of Napishtim, in that order, and thus were \"tweaked\" or \"improved,\" rather, in terms of combat, stat growth, and money gain. Playing in chronological order means playing Origin, then Oif, then Ark, and getting used to things that might be missing, as you go through the series. \n\n     Now, I've played Origin all the way through on all characters on Nightmare difficulty, and the first thing to compare between Origin and Oif, is that Yunica and Adol play similarly to each other, without being exactly the same. For example, while Yunica and Adol's fire spells function identically, Yunica gets her fire magic from a sword, which does slightly more damage than her normal weapon, but swings slower. Other than that, their attack patterns are pretty similar, with Adol doing more thrusting as opposed to Yunica swinging her axe about (which makes sense, considering you don't stab with it). \n\n     In Origin, your dash attack has a chance of lowering the enemy's defence, including bosses. This is incredibly helpful as it can be chained into your normal combo. In OiF, you still have a dash attack, however, instead of lowering the enemy's defence, it is a quick 3-hits, that can be chained into your normal combo. That being said, in Origin, it's imperative to learn how to effectively use your dash attack, where as in OiF, you can almost completely disregard it, and get by just fine. \n\n     The second thing to note, OiF and Origin have a thing called Boost, which functions similar to a Limit Break, if you will; while it's active, movement and attack speed is increased, while damage is greatly reduced. However, Origin added an additional power to that, called Burst, a special attack that, when activated, will use the remaining time on your Boost. The attack varies for each character, but is nice to have, as it's essentially a panic button, to go along with your Limit Break. You don't [i] need [/i] it, but it's nice to have, in the situations where you are surrounded by enemies with 3 HP, and no way out. \n\n     Regarding the difficulty as a whole, of both games, Nightmare is incredibly hard, even frustrating at times, in both Origin and OiF. The difference, however, is that OiF has boss fights that are much more demanding in terms of snap decisions, timing, and reflexes, whereas the dungeons leading up to said fights, are a fun challange. Not particularly terrifying or anything. The first boss, Ellefale, is both a perfect representation of what to expect later on, as well as being a nice throwback to Ys 2, where everything died by fire. If you try to dodge her attacks too early, they will chace after you, and you'll get hit, and likewise, dodge too late, and you get hit. For a first boss, having to learn the timing right then and there is incredibly demanding, especially when you die in 2 or 3 hits. Boss fights like Gyalva and Gildias very much felt the same way, requiring precise timing, quick thinking, and not using every tool in your arsenal will cost you your life. \n\n     On the other hand, Origin had much harder dungeons, yet had less demanding boss fights (not to say that they aren't exactly \"harder\"). I found myself dying quite a bit, as trash mobs used their numbers and large attack power to hit for all I'm worth. The Water Prison has you fighting enemies that can only be destroyed with your earth power, while trying to navigate underwater, looking for more oxygen. The Silent Desert has enemies that, when you first get there, can't be permanantly killed, all the while traversing quicksand, while they come from the ground and dance around you. At times, I felt myself traversing these dungeons with a sense of caution, as the next batch of enemies, and a wrong move would be the end of me. While poor planning will also get you killed in dungeons in OiF, it felt a lot more frequent in Origin. \n\n     Boss fights, however, were a lot more fair. The dodging you had to do from enemy's attacks would prepare you for this moment, because a lot of the bosses have projectiles, or attacks that reach large sections of the field. Jenocres' attacks feel very much like playing a shoot 'em up, for example. Which leads to one of the more noticible changes between Origin and OiF; You see the entire battlefield, and always have eyes on the boss, at all times. During the course of the fight, lightning strikes will come down in the area where you are standing, indicated by circles on the ground. You have to keep running, until the lightning is finished chasing you. Being able to see where  Jenocres is, as well as the entire arena, while dodging attacks that reach every corner of the screen is keeps you from running into another attack, after dodging the last one. \n\n     This, cannot be said for OiF. With the exception of Gildias and Ellefale, you do not normally have constant sight on the boss, the entire arena, and Adol, at the same time, without keeping within a certain distance of the boss. The arena in which you fight is about the same average size as the ones in Origin, however, the camera is focused on Adol, zoomed out for the boss fight. What this means is that to see all of the boss's tells and attacks before they happen, you must keep within a certain proximity. However, the result of that is a smaller margin of error for dodging and reacting to attacks. \n\n     To compensate for the lack of traditional shops, Origin has a system implemented where you can buy powers, named Blessings, which allow your character active passives such as boosted ailment resistance, reduced damage from terrain, or things such as increased item drop rate. However, on Nightmare, all SP (the currency of the game) is worth 1 SP. With the occasional treasure chest giving SP, you will have just enough SP throughout the game to increase the defence on your armour, and obtain 1 to 2 extra skills, depending on what you get, and assuming you are leveling normally. The lack of shops also means that you will find all of your weapons and armour, and any items you obtain must either be found, or otherwise obtained from the story. OiF does not suffer from this, as it does use the traditional shop. You do still find weapons and armour during your escapades, however, you can also buy weapons, armour, and expendable items. Thankfully, unlike in Origin, currency in the land of Felghana is a lot easier to come by, so there is no worrying about saving for just the right moment. \n\n     Upgrading weapons and armour requires two things: money, and Cleria Ore. In OiF, ore comes in abundance, dropped by enemies, along with gold. Every weapon and piece of armour requires both gold, and ore to level up (stat increase), with better equipment being more expensive. Origin has simplified this process, in accordance with the shop system and/or money drop rates. Weapons are upgraded specifically with Cleria Ore, however, they are scattered throughout the game, and power up your weapon enough to last you until the next upgrade, and armour is upgraded by spending SP.", "timestamp_created": 1439924609, "timestamp_updated": 1454248753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504257", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17587380": {"recommendationid": "17587380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014899047", "num_games_owned": 543, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439837309}, "language": "english", "review": "It's pretty hard, but that's what makes it fun.", "timestamp_created": 1439837529, "timestamp_updated": 1439837529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498008", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17552303": {"recommendationid": "17552303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003029471", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502557590}, "language": "english", "review": "- Play the game.\n- Die a lot.\n- New game.\n- \"More like Adol the Yellow.\"\n- Cry", "timestamp_created": 1439652687, "timestamp_updated": 1439652687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17513205": {"recommendationid": "17513205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111882045", "num_games_owned": 466, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478750004}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a blast!

I would recommend this to any Ys fans but personally I was kind of underwhelmed. I'm not even sure what it was that underwhelmed me but I liked Ys Origins a lot more. Maybe it's because it feels like you only need to beat it once and then move on to another game. Save the other Ys games for after you've beaten this one for a more rewarding experience.\n\n[Difficulty - good]: As with the other Ys games, you have difficulties for everyone to be able to enjoy the game although there are at least 2 bosses that are annoying no matter what you choose.\n\n[Story - average]: Pretty standard stuff but I liked the little touches here and there to make the story more than just a standard issue \"Evil being awakens and you happen to be nearby to slay/seal it for the villagers\" story. I don't know if Ys Ark of Nepishtim would explain why Adol and Dogi are traveling together but not being able to own and play it may explain why I feel so disconnected from Felghana.\n\n[Characters - good]: As with all the other Falcom games Steam has, the attention to details about every character's personality and lives is always a pleasure to read about. The merchant trying to get fame and fortune, the hardworking townspeople and a surprisingly kind countess are just a few to name in adding layers to the otherwise cookie-cutter plot.\n\n[Graphics - average]: It's a matter of personal tastes on this one. The characters look great to me since I prefer the 2D anime style over full 3D characters. The cinematics are as lovely as I've come to expect from any Falcom game as well.\n\n[Music - excellent]: One thing this game has no problems with is the music, my favorites would definitely be the world map and clock tower music. Not to say the rest wasn't memorable though.\n\n[Combat - good]: It uses the same combat and magic system as Origins which makes playing one then the other very easy to transition into.\n\n[Length - average]: It may be a good length for people who prefer short games but as for someone with tons of spare time and expectations of RPGs to have decent length and content in them...it was disappointing how quickly I chewed through it. That disappointment also leads to my rating for...\n\n[Replayability - bad]: Unfortunately there is almost no reason to replay this game except to get Steam achievements.

Not game or quest-wise, but you'll notice that the people of this Redmont have a lot less to verbally say than their PSP counterparts. There is no way to program your controller to your liking, and the special bonus pictures and such you could earn throughout the game are gone.

The levelup system is a waste of time. When played on the default difficulty (which is what I encourage, otherwise the game is so easy its boring or so difficult it's unrewarding), you gain XP from monsters until you're on par with their level, at which point killing them becomes completely pointless. This means that you have to grind each zone just to make your character be able to survive that stage, because of this I feel pacing would've been better if you could just play from start to finish with *no* leveling system because in its current state, it does nothing but pad out game length.\n\n2. The backtracking is annoying. I enjoy the Metroid aspect when it's done well, but in this case, most of the things you backtrack for aren't even optional unlockables for boosts, they're story-related items that you need to find in order to progress. It just feels like another way to pad game length, by making you redo areas you've already seen in order to get to the next one.\n\n3. Bosses battles are really well designed, but insanely punishing. Whether this is an issue or not is really up to taste. You don't get to use any recovery items, when you're on-par with the level of the boss (which is only whatever's possible on the default difficulty, since \"grinding\" only gets you to \"par\"), it only takes a few hits to die. Some boss fights can go on for upwards of 5 minutes, even if you know what you're doing, and if you get hit a few times, you die, and have to start the fight from the beginning. Some of the fights are really interesting from start-to-finish, others start repeating mechanics really quickly, which makes them get boring very fast, as they become battles of tedious endurance as opposed to interesting battles.\n\n4. There's almost too much dialogue in a game that seems to be focused on being an ARPG, and really, I didn't find myself liking any of the characters.\n\nHowever, the soundtrack is absolutely stellar, is is most of the stage design. It's really just some of the old-school mechanics being too old-school for their own good, but considering this is a remake of a game that came out in the 80s (Ys 3 - 1989), that kind of explains itself, and as far as remakes go, this is one of the best that's ever been done (not as good as Resident Evil 1 on the Gamecube, however) - it took the game from 2D to pseudo-3D with much better boss encounters and stage design.\n\nIt still plays like an old PC game though, and I wouldn't recommend checking this out unless you have the time on your hands to dig through some RPG history. If nothing else, you should check out the soundtrack. This has some of the best tracks you'll find in any RPG.", "timestamp_created": 1423806605, "timestamp_updated": 1511027919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14210704": {"recommendationid": "14210704", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990978121", "num_games_owned": 563, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422462031}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game.

Great hack and slash game with tight controls and high replayability. You're definitely going to play this more than once.\n\nBe advised though, this game is HARD. As in, don't start it on the hardest difficulty if this is your first time playing as this game is actually an old game, not something that was made in the last 3 years. This means this game was developed back when \"hard mode\" actually meant HARD MODE and not just a slightly harder normal mode where you still pretty much streamroll through the game. I cannot put enough emphasis on this, this game is HARD and you're going to die over and over and over until you finally learn to get good at it.\n\nFor people who hate JRPGS and whatnot don't worry, this game, much like most of the Ys series games, is anti grind so you'll never be underleveled. You also don't have to fiddle around with a bloated inventory or anything like that as your character's progression is pretty straightforward (You don't get different type of swords with different properties, just better swords with more attack power so you can just ignore your old gear).\n\nThe soundtrack is easily one of the highlights of this game. It's probably one of the, if not THE game with the best soundtrack in the entire Ys series and a pretty close contender for game with the best soundtrack ever.\n\nGetting 100% completion is something only the most hardcore players will be able to achieve due to how insanely hard the last difficulties are, so be ready to invest a huge amount of time on that task dying over and over.\n\nSpecial note: Don't pay attention to the store images, the game actually has full widescreen support which was added shortly after the game came out so it won't look as bad as in those screenshots, don't worry.\n\n\nBad stuff:\n\n* Cutscenes.

It is the third game in the Ys series, and a remake of the original Ys III. While the original Ys III was a good game in its own right, it was also a flawed game in many ways (don't take that to mean it wasn't a heck of a lot of fun). Oath in Felghana not only rectifies every flaw of the original, it also improves upon Ys III in every way, all while remaining faithful to the core essence of what made Ys III such a fun and memorable game.\n\nPros:\n- Phenomenal soundtrack\n- Great battle mechanics\n- Unique boss fights\n- One of the best Ys stories\n\nCons:\n- The beginning feels a bit slow\n- (No Volcano)\n- No easy way to access bonus bosses (even if you beat them)\n\nA distinguishing feature of all Ys games is outstanding music, and this is true even for the original Ys III. In Oath in Felghana, the music has been upgraded to entirely new levels of awesome. If the soundtrack was the only good thing about this game, I'd still recommend it at full price. Fortunately for us, the music comes with an awesome game as well.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics of Felghana are some of the best, with controls that are tight and very refined. There are difficulty settings for every kind of player, be they casual or hardcore. Regardless of setting, the game is very encouraging of exploration, but for any difficulty above easy, it's loaded with intense action. Even some strategy comes into play concerning certain enemies and scenarios. Boss fights are varied and unique, and each boss requires a different method in order to defeat them. At higher difficulty levels, boss fights can be very challenging. While there is a random luck factor, for the most part, beating the bosses is a little bit of know-how accompanied by pure mad-skills (and it's very satisfying once you beat them).\n\nOath in Felghana is a bit of an oddball in regards to story. Most Ys games begin with Adol washed ashore after some great struggle. Here, Adol leisurely sails into Felghana with his long-time friend Dogi. Most Ys games feel epic and grand from the get-go. Oath in Felghana feels like a sidestory you could skip over (you\u2019ll regret it if you do though).\n\nThe story has a pace that is uniquely its own, and VERY different from any other Ys game (that I\u2019ve played at least). It ends on a powerful note, but it takes its time getting there (despite being a surprisingly short game). Even though it feels slow, there is always a driving energy that pushes the story forward; you can always feel the hidden danger, even if you don\u2019t fully understand it. And when the story finally hits the turning point, everything comes together perfectly, leading to one of the most powerful moments in any Ys game.\n\nYs stories have depth, but they go by so fast that you may miss some of the more thought provoking themes and ideas being explored. Oath in Felghana, in particular, is an exploration of human weakness. The theme is explored through several characters, all of them strong individuals. And all of them having fallen to human weakness. That said, it is not just the strengths or failures of these characters that make them, in particular, so interesting.\n\nLike the game itself, the story doesn\u2019t give any answers; it shows you what you need to know, and leaves the rest to you.\n\nWhile the slow pace of the game is one of its good points (it matches perfectly with Dogi returning home to family), it has the consequence of making the beginning feel too slow. This is because the beginning isn't interactive enough to offset the slow pace. More interaction means more immersion; experiencing rather than watching.\n\nIf you've had the opportunity to play the original Ys III, then you might remember the Volcano in the background of the Illburns Ruins. And it was AWESOME! I know this isn't really a 'negative' per say, and the Felghana version of the Illburns Ruins is clearly amazing without it. But... this should have made it into Felghana because it was just that cool.\n\nWhile more of an annoyance than anything, there is no easy way to access the bonus bosses, even if you've beaten them before. It would be nice to have a means by which to easily access the two bosses once you've unlocked them. What makes this more annoying is that the bosses are quite fun and challenging, and not deserving of such obscurity.\n\nOath in Felghana is available for both the PC and the PSP. The PC version is, decidedly, visually superior to the PSP version. However, the PSP version has some exclusive content that should not be overlooked.\n\nPSP Exclusives:\n- Voice Acting: While mediocre (sometimes hilarious), it definitely has its own unique charm. And for the most part, I liked it. Unfortunately, the voice acting choices made for the final boss destroyed the atmosphere; it gave the boss more \u2018human\u2019 qualities (made it less monstrous) when it should have done the opposite.\n- PSP Version is More Forgiving: Double Boost (regenerates health after boost), Room Retry (retry in the room you died in), Retry Boss at a Lower Difficulty.\n- Selectable Soundtrack: You can choose between the Oath in Felghana Soundtrack or the Original Ys III Soundtrack.\n- Inferno Time Attack: With double boost, this is probably about the equivalent of Nightmare Time Attack for the PC version. By the way, am I the only one who things Inferno Time Attack should be added to the PC version?\n- Easier Access to Bonus Bosses: (Random Eye Twitch).\n- Museum: This is a collection of unlockable art for the game (not unlike the Ys VI Materials Collection).\n- Prologue Novella: As it turns out, the manuals for the Ys games included a Prologue to the main story. I actually think the Ys prologues should be included with their respective games is all cases (even if it\u2019s as a PDF in the game folder) since they are a part of Ys lore.\n\nWhile the PSP version decidedly has some nice exclusives, I don\u2019t believe it has anything that makes it \u2018superior\u2019 to the PC edition. Both is an excellent choice (I might be evil).\n\nOath in Felghana is a phenomenal game. It is so polished and well executed that it is easilly one of the best action RPGs on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1418878521, "timestamp_updated": 1455333844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.659844", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13419054": {"recommendationid": "13419054", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998995635", "num_games_owned": 375, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509552174}, "language": "english", "review": "Ah, The Oath in Felghana... \n\nMany people like to say that the Resident Evil Remake is the best video game remake of all time. I disagree. While that game is amazing in its own right, the original Resident Evil was already a good game to begin with. Oath in Felghana, however, took an irredeemable pile of dogpoop and turned it into a masterpiece. \n\nBack when I first played this in late 2006 I generally had reservations about it, since my experience with the original Wanderers from Ys was not a very good one (read I threw both cartridges I owned out the window, I'm dead serious), however after finishing it I was so satisfied with it that it instantly became my second favorite Ys game of all time and it still is (I & II will always hold top place in my heart for as long as I live).\n\nIt is generally agreed among the fans that Ys: The Oath in Felghana is, in terms of quality, the best game in the entire saga and for very good reasons (Originbabbies need not apply here, your game is good but it has far too many flaws to be called best of anything. I'll talk about it some other time and incur your wrath then). \n\nNow let me tell you why you really should play this game even if you aren't an Ys fan.\n\n[h1] STORY [/h1] \n\nAround a year after the events of Memories of Celceta legendary adventurer Adol Christin and his longtime companion Dogi the Wall-Crusher are traveling around mainland Europe when they hear rumors that Dogi's homeland, Felghana (located somewhere around real world northern Germany) has fallen on hard times. After a young fortune teller from a passing gypsy caravan confirms their suspicions, they both decide to head to Felghana and investigate. Arriving by boat they soon discover that the land is overrun by monsters and so begins their next adventure...\n\nCompared to the legendary Ys I & II, which had an amazing story, the original Ys III (which wasn't even developed as an Ys game to begin with, but that's another topic) barely had a coherent story to it. Like, it had something similar to a story, but it was all very flat and underdeveloped in comparison to its predecessors. The localised versions we got here didn't help either, all of them, to put it simple, were terribad, which was a huge step down after the extremely high quality PC-Engine localization of Ys I & II.\n\nOath in Felghana, thankfully, fixed all that. The story has been vastly expanded from barely being there, to a very enjoyable one, even if it won't break any grounds in video game writing. The amazing world-building autism that was born with Ys ETERNAL is once again present although not to such extremes as the above-mentioned game. In typical Falcom fashion every single NPC in the game gets new lines of dialogue as the story progresses, so if you want that extra bit of immersion while playing you should take the time to go back speak to everyone every now and then.\n\n[h1] muh grafix [/h1] \n\nFelghana uses the same engine as Ys VI, so from a technical side it doesn't really look much different from it. The sprites and models are of higher quality this time around, but the game won't break any graphical records. Fancy graphics has never been Falcom's goal and I'm thankful for that. XSEED added native widescreen support with the Steam release, but be advised the game was never designed for widescreen monitors, so there will be some small oddities if you do decide to play in widescreen. I originally played it in 640x480 on a virus-ridden Windows XP piece of scrap, so 4:3 doesn't bother me.\n\nPerformance-wise the game will run perfectly even on a toaster, so you shouldn't have any concerns about that. And as usual it runs at 60FPS.\n\n[h1] MUSIC [/h1] \n\nThe only saving grace of the original Wanderers from Ys was its soundtrack. It's amazing and for a long time was considered to be the best Ys soundtrack of all time. This also applied to most of its ports (aside from the NES and SNES ones, if you thought those sounded good you're clearly deaf). The PC-Engine version in particular was so amazingly amazing I feel all warm and tingly inside every time I hear it. \n\nFelghana, however, managed to not only match the PC-Engine soundtrack, but outright surpass it (though this can be debated). In both musical quality and technical quality, Felghana's soundtrack is godly. While both Ark and Origin suffered from the use of lower quality synths, Felghana completely lacks this problem. I've heard that Sound Team J.D.K. used live instruments for this one instead of synths, but even if it was synths they are extremely high quality.\n\nIn short: Oath in Felghana's soundtrack is simply perfect. It does its job perfectly in-game and 11 years later I'm still actively listening to it even outside of the game.\n\n[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1] \n\nWhile Ys I & II were unique in their own right (I'm gonna punch the next person who calls them Zelda-likes, go do some actual research) Wanderers from Ys was nothing but a bad Zelda II clone. And being a bad clone was the least of its problems. The whole game was a mess especially when you started comparing all the different ports it had. It was so bad Ys IV went back to the style of I & II to prevent fans from burning down Falcom HQ.\n\nFor Oath in Felghana Falcom went and rebuilt everything from scratch. While all the areas of the original game are present here, everything has been vastly expanded and infinitely improved. Ys VI was used as a base for the gameplay and in the process they ironed out all the flaws Napishtim had and perfected it. The combat system is simple, but effective. The gimmicky dash jump is gone and Adol controls extremely tight and responsive.\n\nThe main complaint I hear from people who diss Felghana is the difficulty. \n\nI won't sugarcoat it, this game is brutal. Even on normal difficulty it can destroy you if you aren't careful (for reference I have nightmared every single Ys game that has nightmare difficulty aside from Felghana, I've only made it up to hard.) HOWEVER this game is completely and utterly fair. There are no bullsh*t ways to die, every death will be your own fault. \n\nThe boss battles are the highlight of the game. I consider Ys VI's bosses to be extremely easy (not Ys V levels of easy, but close), but here it's the polar opposite. The battles are very intense, you'll need to learn how every boss works to survive and utilize your whole arsenal to achieve victory, especially once you move past normal difficulty. For people coming from the Souls series (because they are mainly the ones who brag about difficulty these days): forget everything you know, you'll need every bit of GIT GUD you can get to survive here. There's no hiding to take a sippie or summoning NPCs to help you, you get one life bar and that's it. You die: you start over.\n\n[h1] TL;DR [/h1] \n\nYs: The Oath in Felghana is an amazingly fun game and the perfect example of how a video game remake should be done. The only really bad thing about it is that it's also responsible for ruining the Ys fanbase by giving birth to the Felghana purists and later the Originbabbies (I'm not dissing Origin fans, only the fanboys who praise it as the second coming and sh*t on everything else).\n\nIt has an enjoyable story, good world-building, an amazing soundtrack and despite its difficulty it has addictive gameplay with god-tier boss battles. The amount of love put into this remake is outstanding and I highly recommend it to anyone who is truly passionate about video games.\n\n[h1] A side note [/h1] \n\nThere is also a PSP port of this game, but unless you really want to play it on the go I suggest you stick to PC. It does have some extras like NG+, a prologue novella, an extra opening cutscene, voice acting which ranges from good to awful and was also localized by an idiot who completely ruined the final boss (hope they got fired). However the difficulty was considerably lowered due to the ability to heal during bosses, it runs at 30FPS and generally looks and feels worse than the PC version.", "timestamp_created": 1418838775, "timestamp_updated": 1494370432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612175", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13351420": {"recommendationid": "13351420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013888613", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1345446000}, "language": "french", "review": "Un bon action RPG, manga, et un monde sublime :)", "timestamp_created": 1418504027, "timestamp_updated": 1418504027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13308881": {"recommendationid": "13308881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032998559", "num_games_owned": 528, "num_reviews": 146, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418589331}, "language": "english", "review": "Fucking terrible.

And, when I say \"full-fledged,\" I really mean it. From the storyline, sound, gameplay and graphics, every aspect of the original game has been completely enhanced. The result is an experience far more ambitious than Wanderers From Ys, the most commonly criticized installment of the series, would have ever dreamed of becoming.\n\nIn terms of storyline, Wanderers From Ys was relatively simple and straight-forward. After the complete liberation of Esteria and Ys (as observed in Ys Books I and II), Adol and Dogi decide to visit the Town of Redmont, Dogi\u2019s hometown. Upon their arrival, they realize that, gasp, the land has been overrun by monsters. The two heroes meet up with Elena Stoddart, a childhood friend, who eagerly explains the recent events. To further complicate the situation, the local mayor has been kidnapped, and Elena\u2019s brother, Chester Stoddart, has abandoned the town. Since becoming knighted in the service of King McGuire and Valestine Castle, his demeanor has changed, and the general public suspects that he\u2019s become involved in something sinister. And, naturally, what could be more sinister than the resurrection of an ancient god of destruction? Thankfully, The Oath in Felghana completely expands upon this old storyline, fleshing out each of the classic characters, adding new ones, and seamlessly weaving each into the tale.\n\nAs expected, The Oath in Felghana shines in the gameplay department. Those who have played Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim will easily recognize similarities. Adol hacks and slashes a bloody swath through countless monsters, always with speed and precision. Oath, however, introduces a new 'combo meter' which serves as an experience multiplier; for each successful hit, the meter rises and an experience bonus is granted. This bonus can climb as high as 1.99x the original experience granted from defeating an enemy, resulting in nearly double experience. If the chain breaks, however, the bonus is reset to 1.00x. Interestingly, Adol is no longer able to use/stock healing items; rather, enemies drop them in battle and provide instant recovery. In addition to healing items, enemies also drop Strength, Defense, and Magic Potions which provide temporary enhancements to the respective traits. Similar to the combo meter, these have a timer attached, so defeating enemies quickly is the key to maximizing their benefits. Adol also has a \"Boost\" feature at his disposal; after having dispatched a certain number of enemies, he will be granted the ability to Boost, which provides a temporary increase in attack speed. As you can see, speed and accuracy are the keys to success.\n\nAside from combat, Wanderers From Ys' equipment system has been subject to revisions as well. The infamous 'Five Magic Rings' have been replaced with 'Three Magic Bracelets.' Each bracelet grants an elemental power, one of Fire, Wind, or Earth. In addition to being useful in battle, utilizing the power of these bracelets becomes simply indispensable when searching for many of the game\u2019s secrets. The Fire Bracelet allows our hero to light torches and melt ice. The Wind Bracelet allows him to whirlwind over large gaps, and otherwise impossible jumps. The Earth Bracelet allows him to break walls and other natural barriers. You can also switch between these abilities on the fly; it becomes an essential element of success in many of the game\u2019s more challenging boss battles. Aside from bracelets, Adol is also able to purchase new swords, armors, and shields. These can be statistically enhanced by delivering them to Adonis, the town blacksmith, who will customize them using rare crystals known as Ravals. Early in the game, Ravals are fairly hard to come by, but enemies drop them semi-frequently in the last two dungeons.\n\nBut, does it have replay value? Tons of it. How about two unlockable difficulty modes, Hard and Nightmare? How about Boss Rush? Those who have completed Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim will be quite familiar with this time attack mode, which allows the player to consecutively battle against all of the game's bosses. And how about the countless side quests and hidden items, such as the War God\u2019s Talisman and the Augite Brooch? There\u2019s always something to do, especially for completionists, who will be hard-pressed to unearth every secret on their first time through.\n\nFinally, in case it wasn\u2019t obvious: Sound - 100%. That\u2019s right, absolute perfection. Ys: The Oath in Felghana has, quite possibly, the most amazing soundtrack in the history of video games. There are no audio issues or \u2018filler tracks\u2019 to speak of. They\u2019ve managed to take an already superb soundtrack and make it even more awesome. Each track, exceptionally remixed from the original compositions in Wanderers From Ys, simply rocks. In particular, \"Valestine Castle\" stands out among the crowd. In true Soundteam JDK fashion, it is exceptionally heavy on the electric guitars and more-than-competently weave in the perfect amount of synth. Speaking directly to fellow fans of their music, I never would have thought that any version of Valestine Castle could overcome/surpass JDK Band 1... I was sorely mistaken. In fact, it\u2019s difficult for me to navigate through the castle at times; when the solo at 2:02 kicks in, I can\u2019t seem to avoid setting the controller down, closing my eyes, and allowing myself to become entranced by the music. It\u2019s that good.\n\nYs: The Oath in Felghana is a remarkable remake which never cuts corners. It\u2019s the best remake ever produced. It\u2019s (debatably) the best installment of the Ys Series ever produced. And it receives my absolute highest recommendation.\n\n[h1][b]Highly Recommended[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1416253032, "timestamp_updated": 1485061731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.674716", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12883288": {"recommendationid": "12883288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081808353", "num_games_owned": 459, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1379554401}, "language": "spanish", "review": "excelente juego, los boss no los encontre facil lo cual me gusto, aunque igual se me hizo corto el jjuego", "timestamp_created": 1415679658, "timestamp_updated": 1480042033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12879790": {"recommendationid": "12879790", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986566078", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421512537}, "language": "english", "review": "Ys Felghana plays very similarly to Ys Origin, so if you played and enjoyed that already you're sure to like this one too. If not, you're looking at a solid, fast-paced (but always manageable) 8-12 hour action RPG, perhaps most easily compared to games like Kingdom Hearts. \n\nAlthough Oath is technically the third game in the Ys series, newcomers can feel comfortable jumping at this point- the game barely references the previous games at all, in fact the only carryover are the two protagonists and all you need to know about them is readily apparent. The story won't shake your world but it's serviceable enough to give Adol an excuse to rampage through the world destroying the entire population of monsters in fluid and satisfying melee combat. \n\nIt's an Ys game, so of course the soundtrack is superb. Lots of noisy high-tempo epic-metal to roll around to, but it never gets obnoxious. Personal favourite is the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXHtkHlLcxQ]Valestine Castle theme[/url].\n\nSpeaking personally I preferred Ys Origin and would recommend that one above this, but the truth is they're both solidly built games and it probably just comes down to which you play first is the one you prefer. Many who played both feel Origin bogs itself down with story while Oath is a lot less story-centric and thus more replayable.

Bosses are huge, with patterns right out of an old school arcade game.\n\nSharp controls and a driving electronic orchestra finishes off the package.

As much my thirteen year old self would hate to hear this, I'm not the gamer that I used to be. Fifteen years later, now an adult with a full time job, I don't have the devotion for gaming as much as I used to have. This game though allowed me to relive my experience of those days where I would stay up to the early hours of the morning, not at all concerned with sleep or the work that I had to be at in a few hours time.\n\nI had recently picked this up on a sale. As it looked intriguing and was 75% off, I figured that I would give it a go. Going from its Metacritic store, I figured that it would be a 'Meh' kind of game. How wrong was I. This was easily the most enjoyment I've gotten out of a game this year.\n\nEnough rambling, on with the review.\n\nThis is an action-RPG with a very satisfying combat system. Within minutes of starting, you're quickly thrown into it. Although the game has a story, a fairly good one at that, you won't be clicking through endless amounts of dull dialogue before you get to the action.\n\nIt's great fun as you run from screen to screen cutting down the monsters that face you. Although there is no way to heal on demand, when I first started playing, I didn't find this to be very challenging even on the normal difficulty, but it was still very satisfying.\n\nWhen I reached the game's first boss, I got my arse handed to me, several times over. Here I initially thought that the game wasn't balanced properly. After a character level and learning the boss's patterns, I was finally able to get pass it, barely.\n\nThis is where that game's core challenge comes from; boss battles. Difficult but I wouldn't call them unfair. Once you're able to defeat them, you're bound to be able to repeat it. The game doesn't factor in luck much. It's a very rewarding experience to get through them.\n\nIn terms of playtime, it took me a little under 14.5 hours. I'm a gamer who tries to I try to find everything I can so it could probably be finished a lot quicker. In fact, there's an achievement to finish it in five hours or less. Could be completed over a weekend, or two in my case. To me, the length was just right, not too long nor too short.\n\nOnce completed, a boss battle mode is unlocked, and the game has five difficulty levels so it has some replayability. There's a number of side quests as well, some of which I somehow had missed so I'll be replaying it.\n\nThe game has a great soundtrack. Normally I'm not one to even notice this unless it's really good which I'm pleased to state is the case here.\n\nI found the story to be better then the average JRPG. This is helped greatly with the range of characters, none of which are nameless or a palette swap of another, which are great contrasts to each other. The weakest would be protagonist who doesn't utter a word, with only a narrator describing his actions.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that for those who buy this, take a look at the forums as someone was able to extract the voices, which are only found in the PSP version of the game, working on this version which greatly adds to the game's atmosphere. It would be good if they're included by default though. Hopefully they'll be patched in in future.\n\nWith all the praise, it's not without its flaws though. This may not apply to the easy difficulty levels but I did spend a bit of time grinding. While cutting down monsters is fun, much more then a turn based RPG, when your EXP bar is rising very slowly, it can become repetitive.\n\nYou're bound to die a number of times on bosses. Mostly while trying to figure out their patterns and then some more after that. At times, I needed to take a break from this as it was becoming frustrating. On the other hand though, once you do get through them, it's very gratifying.\n\nIt's flaws are minor compared to the overall enjoyment I got from it though.

I picked it up on a whim when it was on sale two weeks ago.  At first I thought it would get boring fast with routine hack and slash mechanics.  But lo and behold, you gain skills very quickly that constantly changes the way you engage with enemies.  Tons of fun.  \n\nAnd then you find a save point outside of a big door.  You've been cruising through the game, destroying little baddies and leveling up.  Boss fight, no big deal right? WRONG.  I played through on normal, and every boss took me about 20-30 minutes to master and defeat (on NORMAL).  I realized this cartoony JRPG is just as hard as Demon/Dark Souls when it comes to boss fights.

Though the remake is very much a better game, even at the start and even though is a bit dated, the art style is beautiful and it does have great enhancements compared to the original.\n\nThe story is pretty basic but it was entertaining. It had a pretty good story to it and the characters were interesting. The main antagonist was pretty interesting in his own right even if he wasn't the final boss he still was a good adversary and he was obviously strong through the entire story and had his own motives. The story by todays standards might seem like nothing special but it does tell an old game plot pretty well with enough spice to make it interesting. There are many interesting characters in the narrative and the ending was probably one of the better endings in recent memory. It left an impression.\n\nThe music is fantastic. Everything is wonderful in the soundtrack and the sound effects are really good. Nothing to complain about here.\n\nThe gameplay is awesome. It's very fast paced with enough depth to keep someone interested. Though I do love Action RPGs but this game is pretty challenging on Normal. Probably one the hardest Action RPG's with the exception of DarK Souls. It's not as insane as Dark Souls but it does have quite a bit of frustrating moments. At moments it does require the player to grind to get through the tough boss battles. The boss battles are intense but do give a sense of reward after they are defeated. The good thing about the gameplay is that if you die at a boss battle you don't have to go to your last check point but at the boss fight itself. Once you nab the pattern down for the bosses they are much easier but they do require a bit of skill and luck to defeat, including the final boss which when I saw it fall gave a huge sense of satisfaction.\n\nIf you're not really good at these kinds of games, I would reccomend playing on Easy instead of Normal. I did complete the game on Normal but the challenge was almost to the point where it started to interfiere with how fun the game was. Though it does give a great sense of satisfaction, so if you like challening Action RPG's, this one should fit the bill. Even if Normal is too easy for you there are other difficulities which I will personally never try but they're there for those who are into that.\n\nThe game doesn't have much replayability but I think that I'll defintly play it again down the road.

I haven't played Ys origin yet or any of the PSP ones but this one is the best combat of the Ys games IMO. While my knowledge is only from ys 1 and 2, I think oath in felghana has a better combat system due to the fact it has an actual combat system.\n\nWhile it centers around one area only they're still things to do even after you complete a certain dungeon. The main reason for return to each area as you progress through the game is the metroidvania like system that's implemented. As you gain new powers new areas that may have been inaccessible open up (Like a higher platform) and most of them have really cool treasure locked away.\n\nMain story features Adol the Red and Doji returning to Doji's homeland and things soon get out of hand for the Duo (Like usual). Adol is seemingly stripped of everything at the start yet again, but from a gameplay perspective I understand why. I would have liked if they featured his last games armor and weapons as the basic starter items though.\n\nThe combat system is miles ahead of what ys 1 and 2 had with a combo system, magic built in, multiple magic moves that have charging attacks as well, can jump in the air and do air combos and downward slamming attacks.\n\nA lot of the enemies in the game have some strong defenses in one category but may be extremely weak to another category (Strong vs attacks, weak vs magic). Once you figure out each enemies weakness they become slighty easier to kill off.\n\nBosses are really awesome in this game and most of them feel bullet-hellish (To a minor degree, nothing insane) and require you to learn the bosses patterns to beat them effectively. Some bosses do become pushovers if you overlevel an area via grinding.\n\nMusic is badass like usual with electric guitar and electronica sounds mixed into the game for a bunch of memorable tunes. Also another nice feature is no more grinding an enemy over and over again for its bestiary (Only have to beat it once for it information).\n\nPositive:\n\nGreat combat system\nInteresting combos both in the air and ground\nMultiple magic charging attacks\nReally interesting boss mechanics\nNegative:\n\nStripped of everything at the start\nNo voice over", "timestamp_created": 1399602535, "timestamp_updated": 1399602535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10022121": {"recommendationid": "10022121", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970731100", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 2264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421378472}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my personal favorite game in the Ys series.

And the music, while mostly being decent, never really does anything spectacular, and can, though rarely, be grating.\n\nAll in all, for the first game in a long running series to try something new, it really comes together as more than the sum of it's parts, and what it lacks in polish, it makes up for in charm.", "timestamp_created": 1397005914, "timestamp_updated": 1397005914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.448700", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9619780": {"recommendationid": "9619780", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973663176", "num_games_owned": 578, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393705892}, "language": "english", "review": "fucking awesome game, buy it", "timestamp_created": 1395679202, "timestamp_updated": 1395679202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9375835": {"recommendationid": "9375835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026317882", "num_games_owned": 438, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 2484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1396039413}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is absolutely phenomenal !\n\nNot because of a story, which is barebone and extremely cliche, but for the action and gameplay. Ys is of course from a long line of older ARPG, but if you would like to compare it to a modern game, that would be Super Meat Boy or Dark Souls. All 3 of theses games share the same philosophy. They are tough as nails, but they are fair.\n\nYs is all about skill. You discover new enemies, new bosses, and at the beginning it seems completely impossible, all the odds are stacked against you. Then you start noticing the attack patterns of the enemies. Then you start countering them and damaging them. Then you start feeling in control. But suddenly, with the boss at mid health, it is now using new patterns, and killing you fast ! But then you start noticing patterns again...and the circle can continue again...\n\nYou will die in Ys. You will die a lot in Ys. You will despair, you will rage against the game. But in your heart, you know the game is fair, it is just asking you to hone your skills to prove worthy of victory. And when finally, after countless retries you will manage to defeat that boss you've been stuck on forver, all your previous despair will turn into pure joy, and a feeling of true accomplishment.\n\nAll of that will also be amplified by the beauty of this game. Even though it's obviously dated, the rich environements and superb boss attacks will make you wonder how modern games can look so boring. There are some attack patterns and bosses that just look fantastic, original, and never before seen.

It's a hack and slash rpg where you slay monsters and kill tough bosses to progress through the entire game. I liked Oath in Felghana because after playing Ys Chronicles, the game remains true to the series even if you can't bump into enemies anymore. So what did I think about it? Lets see...\n\nGraphics: This game is a port from the PSP version that was released a few years ago. I liked how Oath of Felghana now has 3d backgrounds or monsters but still maintains a 2d layout. The sprites look nice if you set your graphics to the highest, but I personally think they are simple. I still find the game to great, even with it's cutscenes which look decent but could be better.\n\nSound: I really thought the sound department went forth and had fun making the music. There are good songs, but I just don't find myself to play over and over again. Sound effects are pretty basic, but I don't think that matters. There was never a moment where I just wanted to put my own music to the game which is a plus in my own opinion.\n\nGameplay: If you played Ys Chronicles, you realize that you can't bump into enemies like you used to for exp. There's now an attack button which can be used to string combos to gain exp. What I find the most rewarding is the three magics you obtain in the game. My favorite is probably the wind power since you use it to get to treasures and to another section of the level. If there is one thing I really enjoyed the most are the bosses. Playing on past normal is a challenge as it requires you to be quick about your actions and for you to time your attacks. The game is hard if you're not leveled correctly but it doesn't take you long to be strong enough to take on a boss. \n\nOverall: I consider Ys: The Oath in Felghana a great purchase if you enjoy J-rpgs that aren't complex, yet easy to play but difficult to master. I think falcom did great with this remake because it adds a new chapter in the Ys storyline for American audiences and it is faithful to the first two Ys games in the series.", "timestamp_created": 1392682394, "timestamp_updated": 1392682394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578934", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9095204": {"recommendationid": "9095204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062232960", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448001833}, "language": "english", "review": "Another story where Adol get shipREKTed\n\n6/10 Graphic\n7/10 Gameplay\n5/10 StoreyLane\n11/10 Falcom JDK Sound Team\n\nReplay value : 0", "timestamp_created": 1392345019, "timestamp_updated": 1404949627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9078783": {"recommendationid": "9078783", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984071091", "num_games_owned": 412, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1391928001}, "language": "english", "review": "FIRE BALLS,LASERS,AND SWORDS  JUST SOME OF THE MANY THINGS THAT WILL KILL YOU IN THIS GAME", "timestamp_created": 1392281136, "timestamp_updated": 1392281206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456771", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8827975": {"recommendationid": "8827975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021309089", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2425, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430110409}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, it's an action/adventure-RPG.

But if so, this game should be avoided at all costs), and features a cozy, classic jRPG art style of 3D backgrounds with pre-rendered actors.  The battle system is also quick and enjoyable, if  a bit simple. \n\nThat said, there are some things not that great concerning this game. First of all, it\u2019s not particularly long for a role-play. Beating the game should take no more than 15 hours (and it is entirely possible to complete the storyline in about 5) which is not all that impressive concerning the fact that some other jRPGs have mini-games that are more time consuming.\n\n After completing the campaign, you can try the time attack or replay the story on another difficulty setting. There is no incentive to do so, since perhaps the Oath\u2019s weakest point is its plot. The story told is extremely generic and predictable. Furthermore, the 30-some cast of characters is largely uninteresting. Finally, the extremely pompous  dialogue (and I do say that as a fan of jRPG narration) lines do not help at all.\n\n There aren\u2019t  that many items to be collected either \u2013  6 sets of equipment (sword, shield and armor each \u2013 all with 3 levels of upgrades ), 3 (also upgradeable 3 times )spells,  24 other items (usable, plot tokens or granting a particular ability). And , which is quite surprising in this genre \u2013 no party can be formed at any point of the game \u2013 the protagonist is forever alone (in battle) .        \n\nWhat saves the day and, in the end, redeems this otherwise average game, are some of the most brilliant boss- battles I have ever seen in a jRPG game: quick, demanding and almost perfectly balanced to avoid the excessive grind (at least on the medium difficulty setting). \n\nConcluding, this is not a greatly memorable title and in the end I feel that it abused my longing for a classic jRPG experience, which  kept me in front of the computer until the end. 6 out of 10, and I recommend it solely due to the awesomeness of  boss battles.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1388356117, "timestamp_updated": 1388356117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559194", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8385873": {"recommendationid": "8385873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044116325", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452306260}, "language": "english", "review": "Just beat this game and thought id write this review since it was a very well done game.

That's a tenth or more of your health gone.\n\nThere's also a bit of level scaling to the table. Say a boss is level 15, and you're level 12. You are going to get mopped on the floor. It's possible but it's really hard. Climb up to level 15 and you should be okay. Level up to 16. It's almost a joke!

Before I broke down and bought it I stared at its gameplay video in steam. I stalked the title for months on end. I was delighted to see a JRPG on Steam. Would my delight be broken, or would I take the oath and never look back?\n\nFirst off I must say I played this game to completion with a gamepad. I never even once tested out the keyboard ad mouse controls. This type of game just screamed use a controller to me haha. The game controls perfectly with a gamepad. Every little command I used worked, and never were the controls broken. A++ on that.\n\nSound design in Ys is all about the music. The sound effects are very basic and serve the game well, but do not stand out at all. The musical score on the other hand does stand out. Each piece was moving, and the guitar driven battle themes fit perfectly. Never once did I feel like I wanted to put on my own soundtrack while playing the game. If it's any testament to the games music, I would even go into the options menu just to play the games soundtrack a few occasions.\n\nThe story of the game is its weakest area. The game uses nearly every JRPG trope. I knew of every upcoming plot twist and action. This made me really sad as someone who enjoys a good narrative. I must admit though that not once did the narrative become convoluted. It served its purpous rather well, and that was to transition from dungeon to dungeon and the awesomely addicting gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay of Ys is where it's at. A simple mixture of semi strategic hack n slash with a dabble of platforming and RPG light elements. Combat is fast, fluid and when you get hit it's ultimately you're fault. The game doesn't offer that much in terms of different combos. You can perform only basic ground and air combos. You can't knock an enemy into the air and combo them further. What you can do is cancel combos to get in more hits. There are 3 magic in the game, but playing on normal I didn't find much use for them. The most useful if magics is the earth dash as it nullifies enemy attacks. Once you get this magic it'll be you're go to magic. This is because the game doesn't feature a shield or dodge roll which some may find annoying, but I understood it as part of the game.\n\nLevel design is simplistic and yet very well done. That being said, there are a few areas where you can enter a new screen keep holding the same direction, and move yourself back into the previous area. It's a personal annoyance to me. These areas are few and far between so it's not that big of a deal. The platforming segents mainly located towards the end of the game are well thought out. I initially believed I was going to have trouble with them until I realised your character shadow does appear on the ground. This way you could at least tell where you might land. For people who fear platforming there is a mode in options to make it even easier, and even at that there no fall related deaths in the game.\n\nThe bosses are where the game really shines. Each boss fight presents a new challenge and build upon eachother as the game progresses. You're first time playing the game the bosses will kick your ass, unless you're an uber-gamer, don't get discouraged. Their attacks hit hard, and require precise timing to dodge. There is also limited time to hit the bosses. That window becomes less and less as the game goes on forcing you to get better with your attack dodging. This type of progression is saught after by me, because no matter how much someone could power level, you still need the skill to back it up.

You play as Adol Crispin, a badass red-haired silent hero, visiting a new land called Felghana with your friend Dogi. The story is rather simplistic, so don't expect much from it, but it is serviciable. The meat and bone of this game are, as expected, the combat and its multiple bosses. There are multiple standard moves, and as the game progresses, you will gain newer skills to help you out, all those skills will remain useful for all the game.\n\nThe game's Normal is quite hard for a first timer, but it is actually recommended to start there. This is challenging game, so don't cripple yourself too much, or the game, by playing on Easy mode.\n\nThis game also includes a Boss Rush mode available after the game, that can be played in many difficulities, some will make you pull your hair, but you will feel amazing while doing them.\n\nIf you want to get a valid gamer card, you don't play Dark Souls, you play Ys!", "timestamp_created": 1385419828, "timestamp_updated": 1385419828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7743821": {"recommendationid": "7743821", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963799189", "num_games_owned": 4746, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 1012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481988246}, "language": "english", "review": "Ys: The Oath in Felghana is a very easy game to jump into storywise, even if you have not played any of the previous games in the series. It has its own epic tale to tell, and knowledge of previous events is not required. A fair warning though: if you have never played a Ys game before, start on Easy or Very Easy. I'm not trying to scare you away, but Oath is without a doubt one of the most challenging games to hit the market in recent times. If you choose normal, prepare to die a LOT during the massive boss encounters. That is not to say that the game is cheap or unbalanced, as often tempering your equipment or simply gaining another level will even the playing field. The reward lies in the challenge, and you WILL feel a great sense of accomplishment each time you finally triumph over your foe.\n\nOne way to describe the gameplay in Oath would be to imagine an amped-up Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Add blazing speed and the ability to jump into the mix,  and toss with a heavy dash of well-executed platforming, and you have a hearty recipe for gaming success. Don't just go rushing in headfirst hacking away at your foes with reckless abandon however, the combat in Oath requires a fair bit of strategy. You will have at your disposal three elemental rings, and the powers they bestow upon you are necessary to dispatch your foes with efficiency. Always be on the lookout in hard to reach areas, as you can always find hidden chests containing upgrades and new equipment, as well as the Raval ore needed to temper your gear at the smithy in town.\n\nBack to the topic of combat. The boss encounters in Oath are epic in scale, and they take a fair bit of thinking to overcome. Simply flailing away with reckless abandon is sure to get you killed. Don't be afraid of failure however, if you die in a boss fight you will be given the option to retry as many times as you wish (though beware, dying 10 times to the same boss and the game will mock you with an \"achievement\"). The key to success is to study the bosses patterns, and use the proper attack for the job. If all else fails you can grind a level or two, or temper your gear as I pointed out before.\n\nIt truly is a grand day for the Steam Community and Ys fans alike now that one of the finest games in the series has hit the platform, and with promises of Ys: Origin on the horizon. Oath will definitely fulfill the wishes of anyone who desires a solid JRPG experience on their PC. With an epic storyline, badass bosses, masterful music, gorgeous graphics, and all around gratuitous gameplay, Ys: The Oath in Felghana does NOT disappoint. With unlockables such as higher difficulties, time attack, and boss rush modes, players will be entertained long after the main story has wrapped up. What are you waiting for?

(Or you could read a book.)\n\nHowever, if your cup of tea happens to be runney-jumpey-hackey-slashey-swing-your-swordey-things-get-deadey gameplay where you mow down swarms of monsters, all building up to fights against gargantuan, screen-filling bosses with heavy rock music playing in the background, then you should totally give the Ys series a try.

I & II are fun, but very much showing their age; Seven is a good one also (and was actually my first Ys game), but it's only for PSP. I would actually argue that Origin is better than The Oath in Felghana, but being a prequel, it does have some spoilers for Ys I, and it doesn't have everyone's favorite mute redheaded berserker.\n\nEvery Ys game also comes with multiple difficulty settings, so if you want to let off steam by making everything that looks at you the wrong way your bitch, there's Easy and Very Easy. If you like a really good challenge, there's Nightmare and Inferno. And yes, holding down your jump button (at least I think it's the jump button, off the top of my head) speeds up the text scrolling in the cutscenes.\n\nSpeaking of buttons, if you have a USB controller, you're definitely going to want to dust it off; in my opinion, Ys games weren't meant to be played with a keyboard.", "timestamp_created": 1370048655, "timestamp_updated": 1370048655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578064", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "107094": {"recommendationid": "107094", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962001532", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1072, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1371152199}, "language": "english", "review": "The ground is too soft.", "timestamp_created": 1369448534, "timestamp_updated": 1369448534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "5276063": {"recommendationid": "5276063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047292749", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1369520540}, "language": "english", "review": "This excellent game has a 3/4th isometric view that reminds me of an older platform game called  Landstalker, but with the leveling aspects typical of action oriented role-playing games.

You don't really think about how bullshitty games were back then when you were a kid, you just thought that taping the attack button down in the first dungeon and coming back later when you're at max level is just a thing you do. Most of the Ys games don't hold up really well, and that's why I'm glad Falcom has continually revisited the series while progressing it over the years.\n\nThis remake of Wanderers from Ys is completely top shelf. Sure, the story's still about as dry as it ever was, but the game is just a damn joy to play. Fast-paced, breakneck combat cut with (almost always) just the right amount of punishing difficulty and the spectacularly responsive controls make it a joy to play for those of us that like a good bit of twitch reflexes and pattern memorization. There's rarely ever any need to grind like in the original either, given that each dungeon is set to level you up appropriately before each boss encounter.\n\nMy only real issue is that the game's balance can be a bit wonky and a few boss encounters border on unfair and completely luck based. It's just really weird how a few times simply gaining one level or piece of gear will suddenly cut enemy damage down by 50-75%, and a few bosses can get really cheap in their patterns by either canceling their vulnerable states with attacks you simply can't dodge or unleashing a combination of attacks that trap you in a way that's really unfair. \n\nEven with its slight flaws, Oath in Felghana was a treat to roll through and I felt satisfied with my victory in the end in a way modern games don't really strive for anymore.", "timestamp_created": 1359471390, "timestamp_updated": 1385409394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "1694303": {"recommendationid": "1694303", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996575664", "num_games_owned": 406, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 945, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1359446400}, "language": "english", "review": "While enjoyable, this game is brutal on anything higher than normal.

This Ys game has more - and better - metal music than Origin does, but Origin really nailed the violin sound, much better than this game. Besides that, this game isn't quite as linear as Origin, but then Origin makes up for it by telling a better story and multiple characters with multiple stories.\n\nThis game's graphics can be slightly bland with the odd shading style, but in a way it's quite a work of art. The level designs are actually well done. The controls are responsive besides my nit pick with upward slashing. Bosses are EPIC, especially as you progress. The game is literally worth $5 JUST for the boss fights. It's a fun game that will probably take you about 10-15 hours to beat once, but if you want to get all the items and sidequests (there aren't a lot of items, as it's a fairly short game compared to most RPGs), you'll probably spend more than 15 hours.

You start with a simple sword combo and jump, but subsequently aquire other abilities, like dash and double jump, as well as elemental spells, that not only do damage, but change the way you move and behave in battle. Wind spell lets you glide in air, useful for making long jumps and avoiding some boss attacks; Earth spell can break some walls to reveal hidden paths and provides you with invincibility frames; Fire spell... just shoots fireballs, that's all.\n\nMain gameplay basically consists of two sections.\nFirst, you have to traverse the level and reach the next boss. Enemies in level may start as challenging and drive you back to town to heal and upgrade your equipment, but little by little you will be pushing forward, gaining levels and eventually will overcome any obstacle. Exploring levels rewards you with some very useful items as well.\nThen, when you get to the boss, real fun starts. Game rewards you with an achievement for dying ten times in a single boss fight and I almost got it with the very first boss encountered - reached 9/10. Needless to say, I \"succeeded\" unlocking this achievment with the second boss. Boss attack patterns are varied and tend to change mid-fight, when you think you're adapted to it. The last boss in particular will mercilessly test everything you learned in the game - you have to have lightning reflexes and full control over your character movements to beat it, but when you'll do it you will feel like total badass.\n\nFinal word about music. It's often praised in reviewes, but I was afraid that it will not fit the fantasy setting.

Ys III was the sequel to the classic Ancient Ys Vanished duology, and followed the autobiographical story of the world's most famous adventurer, Adol \"The Red\" Christin, albeit in a new setting with a plot mostly unrelated to the previous games.  The Oath in Felghana follows the same overall story as the original, but with many additions.  However, the story is not even remotely the focus of the game and while the characters are charming and the plot is by no means awful or unbearable, it's also very barebones, like its predecessors.  The series is well-known for its fantastic music, and The Oath in Felghana is no exception to this.  It has one of the finest soundtracks in the industry, with calm, soothing melodies, fast-paced frenetic orchestral music, and powerful rock themes for the more intense fights.\nYs III's main departure was in the gameplay department, where the top-down \"bumper car\" combat of the previous games was replaced by a side-scrolling platformer.  This new style was poorly received by series fans for being too clunky and slow in comparison to the older combat style.  The Oath in Felghana completely overhauls the combat and gameplay, to the point where the only real similarity to the original are some side-scrolling-styled segments.  \nThe combat in The Oath in Felghana is a drastically improved version of Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim's style.  It's a fully 3D action-based combat system that is extremely fast paced and rewards patience, quick reflexes, timing, and the utmost precision over memorization, button mashing, \"cheesing,\" or trial-and-error.  Unlike Ys VI, there are no consumable healing items in The Oath in Felghana.  The only way to restore your health is by touching a save point, using one-time powerups occasionally dropped by enemies, or by leveling up.  You can also restore health while outside dungeons by standing still for an extended period, but it's usually faster to simply run to a save point.  In addition, enemies will sometimes drop powerups that boost your stats temporarily, and keeping on the offensive keeps your combo counter high, giving you bonus experience.  This combination rewards players for keeping a fast tempo through a dungeon, as staying on the offensive levels you more quickly and nets you more stat and health bonuses.  However, during a boss fight, there are NO powerups available, so you can only defeat the boss with pure skill.  With the exception of a single boss on a specific difficulty setting, every attack that each boss uses can be completely avoided with the right timing and technique, and thus you must be entirely reliant on your skills and reflexes to win.  This doesn't mean that the bosses are easy, however, as some bosses will fill their arena with projectiles and particle effects that can be extremely difficult to avoid effectively while also damaging the boss.  Each boss is also entirely unique, except two recurring boss fights (which are significantly more powerful and more difficult on their second round) and no bosses that might as well just be a really powerful regular enemy.\n While each level is memorable and each combat skill you obtain is used to traverse dungeons and avoid traps, regular enemies can sometimes be very simple to defeat on lower difficulties, which can lure some players into a false sense of security, leading them into believing they're ready to fight a boss when they may not be.  One thing that is very important to remember in The Oath in Felghana is to ALWAYS ensure that you've explored every level thoroughly and obtained each treasure, and to upgrade your equipment regularly.  If you don't, the game will punish you HARD.  This can be a tempting challenge to skilled veterans, but to players not used to RPG-styled exploration, it can be a very rude awakening.  In addition, the game is very difficult.  The lower difficulties are definitely managable for most players, but they also dull the experience somewhat.  Normal will provide a good challenge to those who don't often play action games.  Hard and Nightmare difficulties will provide a significant challenge even for the most skilled and experienced players and can be extremely frustrating for people unused to the genre.\nThe Oath in Felghana has a Time Attack mode that you can unlock upon completion of the game that allows you to re-fight any boss on any difficulty with pre-set equipment and stats, and while this can provide dozens of hours of entertainment to those looking to challenge themselves at speedrunnin or people who just want to re-visit their favorite boss fights on various difficulties (as well as an opportunity to unlock a secret boss), the game offers little else in terms of replay value other than playing the game again on a higher difficulty (which improves boss' AI and makes many of their attacks more complex and harder to avoid).  However, for $15, The Oath in Felghana is worth the price of entry even if you only complete the game once (which should take between 10 and 20 hours) and then never touch the game again.

I love a good challenge as well as fast paced games that require quick reflexes. Games like the Megaman X Series, Hyperlight Drifter, ICEY, etc. are some of my personal favorites.\n\nThis is my first Ys game, btw. Going into this I initially was in love with the extremely quick and responsive, and extremely satisfying combat system. Exploring dungeons and cutting through droves of monsters like butter was fantastic. All was going well up until those damn boss battles started rolling around. \"Difficult\" isn't even the appropriate word to describe these battles. \"Stupid\" seems more appropriate. There is no real skill involved in defeating these bosses, contrary to what other users may be saying. \n\nThe idea is to go into a boss battle and bash your head against the boss wall until you've memorized every phase of the boss. It is literally impossible to defeat a boss on your first attempt. You spend your first 5 or so attempts memorizing their first phase until you can predict it fairly easily. Again, no real skill involved, just wrote memorization. Once memorized that phase becomes trivial, yet you're still forced to play through it (often takes a while) until you get to the next phase of the boss, at which point mechanics alter. Boss fights take forever simply due to this seemingly cheap tactic of drawing out the game - you spend most of your time replaying phases you've already memorizing, only for the opportunity to face and perhaps memorize the next phase. A ludicious design to say the least.\n\nA point that begs mention is that while you cut through droves of monsters with relative ease, all boss battles smack you down in a few blows. The discprenacy in difficulty between dungeon exploring and actual boss battles is staggering. \nFurthermore, most boss battles are simply insulting. For example, in one particular fight you, a veteran swordsman, goes up against someone who's apparently a newly appointed knight. Your blows do 3-5 damage, (unless of course you try your ranged ability which does 1), while he does between 20-38 damage per blow. Your hp? About 120. His? 700. Combine this with the general mechanics of learning and overcoming boss battles and you'll start to understand how miserable and unsatisfying of an experience boss battles are.\n\nThe whole point is to have fun while gaming, isn't it? I still believe that, though I may be in the minority. Thus I cannot reccomend this game in good concience. Unless of course you're the kind of person that enjoys childbirth and icepick lobotomies, then step right up!", "timestamp_created": 1520347898, "timestamp_updated": 1520347898, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40601267": {"recommendationid": "40601267", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973095348", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 10134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520318106}, "language": "english", "review": "Introduction:\nThis is definitely my favourite of the Ys series.  The story, characters, and music all tie together well, and when paired with interesting and well-balanced gameplay, it makes for an awesome experience.  \n\nNote for all Ys Games:\nI recommend playing them in the order that they were created rather than in the order of the Ys timeline as everything will flow better and no plot twists will be spoiled.  If you're just in it for the story, no need to ramp up the difficulty, but if you're in it for the true Ys experience and all the achievements, start on the hardest difficulty... only if you're ready for a challenge (this game is extremely difficult and when you finally take down those bosses, you really feel a sense of achievement).  Onto the review.\n\nGameplay Mechanics:\nCombat:\nUnlike Ys 1 and 2, you have a variety of attacks and movement available to you.  You have various physical attacks/combos, 3 types of magic all with normal and charged activation, a boost state (rage, special, etc.), and the most amazing ability of all... Adol can now push his feet into the ground with sufficient force resulting in him launching off of said ground.\n\nParty:\nUntil you get to Ys 7, you go solo (no party).\n\nEquipment/Inventory:\nNo crafting in this game but you can upgrade your gear. You buy/find all of your items and gear and monsters give you gold, exp, and raval (used to upgrade your equips).  Just like Ys 1 and 2, Adol is not a thief... breaking into peoples' houses and rummaging through their drawers will not result in you acquiring pantsu (I tried).\n\nQuests:\nWhile there is no quest log, certain NPCs will have things for you to do at varying times throughout the storyline.\n\nAchievements:\nOne issue for me is that some of the achievements need to be done on every difficulty level.  This means you need to beat the game (at least up to that point) 6 times, and one of those achievements \"That's the Last Time, Kid\", can be missed (if you're after all achievements, keep track of this one).  This makes the whole process pretty time consuming.\n\nStory:\nLike all the classics, you are the hero. Go save that princess. Slay the boss man. Ride/sail off into the sunset. While there are no daring writing choices, there are no issues or breaks in the immersion which is just as important if not more important. Like my initial note, if you play this on a difficulty that is not challenging to you, you don't get the right experience.  If you start on a high difficulty, make it to the first boss, and experience difficulty, don't give up right away.  Watch a video of the fight and keep trying.  Only if you're certain that you can't beat it should you dial back the difficulty (it was hard with plenty of rage, but if I played on a lower difficulty, it would not have felt like I earned those victories).\n\nFinal Score:\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1520318095, "timestamp_updated": 1520318095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40543470": {"recommendationid": "40543470", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999282226", "num_games_owned": 657, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520068638}, "language": "english", "review": "Ys: Oath in Felghana is a remake of the originsl Ys III: Wanderers of Ys, and takes place chronologically after Ys Origins, and Ys 1 an 2, and before Ark of Napishtim and later games. It has none of the features of the PSP re-release, unfortunately, but is perfectly fine, running smoothly at 60 FPs with no drops whatosever.\n\nAll of the Ys games pride themselves on being very fast paced action RPG affairs, and OiF is no exception. It builds on the Napishtim engine games, and is the second of the series, the first being Ark of Napishtim itself, and Ys Origins being the final culmination of the games. Oath is difficult, even on Normal, and even for fans and devotees of the Ys series, and this speaks nothing of playing the game on Nightmare and Inferno if you're interested in achivement hunting all of the content. (which will require beating the game no less than 6 times, and time attack completely 3 times, as well as post rush boss content) Oath builds on the base of Napishtim and perfects it, removing buying healing items completely and forcing the player to rely entirely on drops and skill.\n\nYs: Oath in Felghana again tracks the adventures of Adol and Dogi after Ys 1 and 2, and returns them to Dogi's homeland of Felghana, and the town of Redmont. Soon enough, you come across Dogi's old friend Elana, and hear about her missing brother Chester, and the monsters that have been plaguing the land, and Adol and Dogi suddenly find themselves off on another monster crushing adventure, with a few hints and tidbits about previous games sprinkled throughout, linking the series through these quiet connections.\n\nThe gameplay is like the other Napishtim games, relying on combos, Focus (a shorrt lived but powerful boost to attacks and defense and combo ability), and spammable magic spells (a ranged fireball, an aoe tornado, and an invincible rock-dash) to let Adol cleave through enemies at blinding speed and rack up XP multipliers and temporary stat buffs. Platforming is frequent and sharp, with Adol being incredibly responsive to movements at all times, even when dashing at full speeds. Bosses often represent steep difficulty spikes compared to normal enemies, but this is standard for Ys games. Bossfights have a lot going on, but almost always feel fair in how they work (save for one lava boss), attacks are essentially always telegraphed, even if it's a quick tell, and so you can dodge and position properly. I didn't need to grind much at all, except for one specific instance  in the aforementioned lava land. As long as you fight every enemy you see, you'll have enough XP and GP for everything you need, plus a little extra if you want to buy a couple extra HP elixers (I ended up having the spare money for 3 by the end of the game)\n\nThe music is up to Ys standard, the classic mix of power rock and orchetral environment music, so if you're used to the series, you're going to get much more of that, and if for some reason Oath is your intro to the series, 1: Good luck, this isd a rough starter entry to the series, and 2: The music is fantastic, so enjoy.\n\nOath is a shorter Ys game and has an achievement for beating it in under 5 hours, but I'm confident it could be much much faster. Much like Origins, I think most players will play on one of 3 difficulties: Very Easy just to play the story and see the game, Normal for the usual challenge, and Nightmare into Inferno for the true Ys dedicated people (or people who hate their lives and want to grind out a boss forever because of 1 mistake - not for me). The boss rush extra content is optional, and unlike Origins, you only unlock a single extra bossfight and no other content besides achievements.\n\nOverall, Oath is probably my second favorite of the Ys games I've played (Origins is my favorite but by a very narrow margin), and I've yet to play Napishtim, or Ys Seven. Oath has some of the best bosses in the series though, both in how you have to react and fight, and in the satisfaction you get when you finally best them. Strong recommendation - but also recommended you play Ys 1 and 2 first, at the very least, to be grounded in the series and have an understanding of how \"the game works\" even though the combat systems differ between the games.  Going from Origins to Felghana isn't a big step down - the graphics are a bit less, and Origins has more caracters, but you'll already be right at home with how the combat system works, and what's expected during bossfights and normal combat.\n\nSail forth and defeat your enemies!", "timestamp_created": 1520105703, "timestamp_updated": 1520105703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40206010": {"recommendationid": "40206010", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078152869", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519161027}, "language": "french", "review": "Etant un grand adepte de la s\u00e9rie Ys je voulais essayer cet opus.

While Napishtim was objectively superior to Kefin in every possible way, it was still rough along the edges: effectively rebuilding a D minus/F-grade game's mechanics into something I'd place anywhere from a B minus to a solid C.\n\nMeanwhile, there's the third game in the series: Wanderers from Ys, released on far more platforms than I care to list. A significant departure for the series, Wanderers was a side-scrolling action game that relied on linear platforming more than the traditional top-down labyrinths seen in previous and future titles. It felt less like an Ys game and more like a successor to games like Castlevania and especially Zelda II, another contested sequel. Generally considered a black sheep of the franchise as a whole, Wanderers from Ys was also the first game in the franchise to receive a widespread release in the West, appearing on all three major 16-bit platforms -- while the original Ys was limited to Sega's Master System and a limited IBM PC release, and the second game was only released on the TurboGrafx-CD, via a compilation of the first two games.\n\nSo with remakes of the first two games, as well as a new sixth entry in the series, Falcom decided that rather that going straight into developing a seventh game -- more on that later -- they would remake the contested third game in the series, using the framework they developed for Napishtim as a base. This development culminated in what is generally considered among the best games in the entire series: The Oath in Felghana.\n\nWhile Wanderers from Ys was more or less a standalone game, Felghana reimagines many of the story's elements to afford a greater sense of continuity with future games in the series. That being said, the basic outline of the game is kept the same and Falcom focuses more on expanding existing characters than outright adding brand-new ones (though there are a few of those as well). This leads to a storyline that manages to stay true to the source material, while feeling more complete at the same time. The story begins with Adol and his travelling companion Dogi returning to Dogi's home village of Redmont after a fortune teller warns of disaster in the area. Upon arrival, the two adventurers find Felghana infested with monsters, a new figurehead installed by the Romn Empire (a recurring foe of Adol's) and worst of all, Chester Stoddard in league with him, causing even more problems for the ailing villagers.\n\nNapishtim was a good start for a more modernized take on the Ys games, but Felghana smoothes out its predecessor's various issues, leading to a much more streamlined and responsive game. It also retains a similar graphical style, focusing on aesthetics over graphical fidelity. Wanderers from Ys' soundtrack was the only element of the game that fans generally liked -- with the TurboGrafx-CD/Perfect Collection, arranged by Ryo Yoneimitsu being considered the best iteration of the classic soundtrack -- but Yukihiro Jindo's soundtracks, consisting entirely of new arrangements of every song from previous versions of the game managed to deliver what many fans consider to be the definitive way to experience the game's soundtrack.\n\nXSEED released this game well after they released it on the PSP. It was their first PC release -- and it shows. None of the extra features associated with the PSP version are present in this release, including the art gallery and the voice acting. Of course, that means that the rebalancing that made the game easier and more tedious in many respects are also not present, which I think is a fair trade. XSEED did manage to optimize the game for more modern PC platforms, even implementing support for higher resolutions and widescreen, so at the very least, XSEED's release is the ideal way to play the game on PC.\n\nMany people will recommend going for Felghana first if you're just getting into the series. Admittedly, that's not the way I handled it, but if you want to get a feel for the series before diving into the rest of the games, Felghana may very well be the best place to start. While most Ys games have episodic storylines in general, Felghana's story relies the least on earlier games in the series, the gameplay from Napishtim has been refined into something that is both easy to learn and a joy to master and both the aesthetics and sound design are top-notch. It's generally available on sale for a hefty discount, but personally, I'd say that it's well worth the full $15.", "timestamp_created": 1517704192, "timestamp_updated": 1517704192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39823435": {"recommendationid": "39823435", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026637457", "num_games_owned": 1021, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517683425}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the main characters name is Dogi.", "timestamp_created": 1517684712, "timestamp_updated": 1517684712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39727649": {"recommendationid": "39727649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198746302688", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518105040}, "language": "schinese", "review": "  \u5973\u4e3b\u5f88\u575a\u5f3a\uff0c\u5973\u4e3b\u54e5\u54e5\u4e5f\u5f88\u5e05\u6c14\uff01\n  \u597d\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u5565\u65f6\u6c49\u5316\uff1f\n  \u9f0e\u529b\u652f\u6301\u6cd5\u8001\u63a7\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff01\n  \u5e0c\u671b\u96f6\u8f68\u78a7\u8f68\u4e5f\u80fd\u4e0a\u67b6\uff0c\u82e5\u80fd\u6c49\u5316\u4fbf\u66f4\u597d\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1517322507, "timestamp_updated": 1517322507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39684840": {"recommendationid": "39684840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043630976", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517302508}, "language": "english", "review": "The best Ys.", "timestamp_created": 1517152972, "timestamp_updated": 1517152972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39670388": {"recommendationid": "39670388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022259298", "num_games_owned": 887, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517103268}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a bold statement to say this is the best action jRPG of all time.

Most interactions are connected to a thought of \"Oh, I wonder what I will get in return\" which usually ends with material rewards or favors that remain 'useful' for further objectives in the game. In point n click adventure games there is also a recurring sadistic (and slightly dehumanizing) type of interaction with characters that provide an obstacle for the player character. Guybrush incarcerates a salesman in a coffin (Monkey Island 2), Drew rigs a gymnast's equipment (Toonstruck) and Rufus tranquilizes his ex-girlfriend (Deponia). \n\nDropsy is different in that it respects the shared humanity between its protagonist and surrounding characters, aswell as turning the player character's relationships from instruments to reach an objective to the central objective of the game.\nDropsy, as a character, might at first glance seem very naive and maybe even stupid (Who hugs trees, right?), but what turns out to be their central quality is being empathetic in a world that seems to be void of it. At the start of the game most characters seem disconnected from each other, absorbed in their own problems. It is Dropsy - an empathic individual, first regarded with rejection, condemnation and fear - that helps them overcome or cope with their problems to start connecting the world again. The Clown's objective is as much a task of finding acceptance and friendship, as a genuine interest in bringing happiness to the saddened lives of others. It is the latter that made this game so refreshing and wholesome to me.\n\nNow, there are other elements to it. There's intriguing mystery, a striking soundtrack and certainly also a few narrative flaws---but what I would say makes this game so special is how it values its relationships. It creates this really wholesome game experience that I would like to see games to explore further and more often.", "timestamp_created": 1516201854, "timestamp_updated": 1516202051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39385911": {"recommendationid": "39385911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003940908", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "last_played": 1516095944}, "language": "english", "review": "A very well  made simple clicking adventure game.\nExcellent calming music, characters show clear emotions and it has it's own art style.\nFollow the story of a disliked clown as soon you get sucked into the game.", "timestamp_created": 1516096095, "timestamp_updated": 1516096095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39357380": {"recommendationid": "39357380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273192820", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 294, "last_played": 1515910736}, "language": "english", "review": "Dropsy is such a nice and fun game for those who like point and click!

(Though there is some Sim-ish looking words in the game you can translate if you want to.) While Dropsy himself is pretty scary looking, he's actually nice. That's actually the crux of the game. Dropsy goes around town solving people's problems, hugging them once he's done. As you're doing this, you slowly uncover his backstory and the true villian of the game.\n\nThe game itself is pretty straight forward with it's puzzle. A few gripes though. \n\nThere is a day and night cycle where time passes a bit each time you enter a new screen. Some characters are only available at certain times of day, etc. While a nice idea, in reality it just seemed to eat up time needlessly and didn't add much to the game. You can sleep to advance time, but it requires finding a bed. This wasn't a huge problem though. Most characters are always available. \n\nThat brings me to the next problem though. There is a lot of walking back and forth. You do get a fast travel option, but I got it so late in the game it didn't seem to make much difference.\n\nAll in all, Dropsy is pretty damn good.

This has to be one of the most uplifting games I've played in recent memory. The puzzles are challenging but doable, and the world is just large enough for you to lose yourself in it without it being overwhelming.  At the start you can roam a good chunk of the island straight away, with additional areas unlocking as you progress. You gradually gather 3 furry friends which allow you access to places the main character can't go. There is no dialogue, everyone communicates with emotes, which by and large are clear and easy to understand. The art is very cartoony with a surrealist undercurrent, but is all very well done. The soundtrack is fantastic too. As you progress you solve problems for people which makes them happy, enabling you to hug them, making Dropsy one of the most heartstring-tugging games around.

But now years later after that horrible night, the people still mistrust and fear him. \n\nEven thinking he caused the fire, but that won\u2019t stop him as Dropsy goes on a journey of self-discovery with love and unmerited kindness with him. Can he make the people see he is more then what they think of me? Who knows but Dropsy is going to try.\n\nNow for what I liked, first off I liked the story and how it could go from heartwarming and sweet to vary creepy and disturbing to a hollowing sadness sometimes.\n\nLiked the fact that this is a complete Text Free Experience, it\u2019s very hard to do but these guys did it, with the characters through an innovative use of visual icons rather than traditional text-based dialog trees. And even without the dialog trees the characters say enough without saying anything.\n\nThe music was very good too, from the gentle electric piano and saxophone melodies, to the space echo drenched dub regga.\n\nThe pixel graphics/art style really good, and like I have said before games like this prove you don\u2019t need super realistic graphics to make a great game.\n\nI all so liked how could hug all most anything it sounds super creepy but this pulls it with warmth a heart and little bit of funny too.\n\nNow for what I did not like, really there is nothing but well some of the Achievements can be a bit of a pain like the What Does It Say About His Clown Level!? Achievement, but that\u2019s really all that\u2019s bad about this game.\n\nSo all in all Dropsy is one of games that is going to be a classic and I so recommend this game.

The artwork style is terrific to look at.\n\nThis title includes a VERY impressive soundtrack, I recommend buying the additional content to have it for later.\n\nIt employs an interesting and engaging mechanic of splitting up tasks and obstacles across different playable characters (think of Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick's work in Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle and (published after this title) Thimbleweed Park). In addition, the characters become available as a result of plot advancement, nice.\n\nLong-range navigation was also handled smoothly and logically by integrating the ability to travel long distances quickly into the plot. Again, reminscent of other master game developers like Gilbert/Winnick.\n\nAll communication with characters and objects/documents is by pictogram. Part of the fun of the game is figuring out what a character is trying to say from the glyphs. This is unique in my experience and adds to the quirky charm.\n\nI would rate this game highly amongst master works of interactive fiction. An absolute joy, buy it!\n", "timestamp_created": 1511565256, "timestamp_updated": 1511565256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37396654": {"recommendationid": "37396654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095727810", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511549592}, "language": "english", "review": "Very funny game and weird \n", "timestamp_created": 1511549776, "timestamp_updated": 1511549776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37369859": {"recommendationid": "37369859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119850496", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481646802}, "language": "english", "review": "Find out about the sinister truth of clown smiles and wet hugs.", "timestamp_created": 1511541105, "timestamp_updated": 1511541105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37360951": {"recommendationid": "37360951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052536783", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511535383}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a feelgood game.

Nele voc\u00ea joga com um palha\u00e7o, que, adivinha?, se chama Dropsy. Eu morro de medo de palha\u00e7os, desde que era pequena, mas ao jogar Dropsy e me ocupar com os quebra cabe\u00e7as, ouvindo uma am\u00e1vel trilha sonora de fundo, eu cheguei a me esquecer disso. Amo esse jogo e aos seus personagens, que mesmo sendo simples t\u00eam objetivos, desejos, e personalidades (n\u00e3o s\u00e3o profundas, eu sei, mas torna cada um memor\u00e1vel). A l\u00edngua que encontramos aqui \u00e9 muito engra\u00e7ada, assim como os efeitos sonoros, e contribui para construir os ambientes da cidade que vamos explorando durante a campanha. O jogo trabalha com um sistema em que o tempo vai passando conforme voc\u00ea avan\u00e7a, indo de manh\u00e3zinha at\u00e9 o anoitecer, no come\u00e7o eu me preocupei achando que teria um limite de dias, mas n\u00e3o xD ainda assim, \u00e9 muito importante as horas passarem; tem lugares que s\u00f3 funcionam em determinado hor\u00e1rio, e intera\u00e7\u00f5es que dependem desse elemento. Eu meio que senti como se n\u00e3o estivesse avan\u00e7ando no calend\u00e1rio, e sim presa num mesmo dia, que se repete infinitamente; porque n\u00e3o h\u00e1 \"tarde demais\", ou coisas que voc\u00ea perde por n\u00e3o ter feito a tempo. Ent\u00e3o eu tomei meu tempo pra jogar, e pra aproveitar bem Dropsy.\n\nAl\u00e9m do Dropsy, voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m conta com outros tr\u00eas companheiros para te ajudar com os puzzles: o cachorro dele, um ratinho, e um p\u00e1ssaro. Voc\u00ea vai trocando e jogando um pouquinho com cada um dos tr\u00eas, j\u00e1 que eles t\u00eam suas pr\u00f3prias habilidades e jeitos diferentes de interagir com os objetos. Quando Dropsy lan\u00e7ou, dois anos atr\u00e1s, eu assisti uma gameplay do come\u00e7o e fiquei com tanta vontade de jogar que parei e decidi que n\u00e3o procuraria nada do jogo at\u00e9 poder experiment\u00e1-lo eu mesma. E agora, em 2017, eu finalmente pude jogar. No come\u00e7o eu achava que era s\u00f3 um joguinho bonitinho, em que voc\u00ea tinha que abra\u00e7ar todo mundo, mas acabou que era muito mais. Dropsy tem um leve toque de terror, e situa\u00e7\u00f5es que te fazem parar pra pensar na vida. Afinal, o que ser inocente num mundo como o nosso te traz?\n\nN\u00e3o posso deixar de dizer isso aqui, mas talvez seja um spoiler, ent\u00e3o esteja avisado: [spoiler] esse final foi MUITO parecido com o do Labirinto do Fauno [/spoiler]\n\nE \u00e9 por isso que eu indiquei Dropsy para a categoria \"O Mundo Est\u00e1 Indo de Mal a Pior, Podemos ser Todos Amigos?\" da segunda edi\u00e7\u00e3o dos Pr\u00eamios Steam.

Cada uno de ellos podr\u00e1 hacer una cosa distinta (Colarse en sitios, alcanzar objetos que est\u00e9n fuera de nuestra distancia etc...)\n-El juego cuenta con ciclo de dia y noche. Dependiendo de esto habr\u00e1 o no algunos personajes \n-El juego no tiene ni una sola linea de dialogo, ni en el men\u00fa, todo se explica mediante bocadillos con dibujos e imagenes.\n-Tienes que abrazar a gente XD\n\nLo que me ha gustado:\n\n-El arte, muy chulo\n-La historia se pone interesante hasta cierto punto\n-Dropsy, con todo lo feo y repulsivo que es, es buena gente\n-Me parece un juego original\n\nLo que no me ha gustado:\n\n-El hecho de que ni en el men\u00fa tenga letras se hace, al menos al princpio, un poco lioso. No me esperaba para nada que el juego no tuviese ni una sola letra (original pero algo lioso para mi)\n-El final de la historia, pienso que est\u00e1 desaprovechada y el final es muy muy muy abrupto, como si decidieran cortarlo del tir\u00f3n. Es una l\u00e1stima porque cuando mas interesante se ponia se termina. \n-Misiones secundarias en una aventura gr\u00e1fica: Tengo el siguiente problema con esto, el juego sigue una historia principal pero luego hay un mont\u00f3n de gente a la que ayudar. Algunos son indispensables para avanzar en la historia y otros no. A mi me hubiese gustado ayudarlos a todos pero no sabia cuales necesitan de objetos de la historia principal y cuales no. Llegados a cierto punto del juego no puedes ya hacer nada y te causa cierta impotencia. \n\n\nConclusi\u00f3n\n\nMe ha dejado cierto sabor agridulce por el final de la historia, cuando mas interesante se ponia se termina de una manera muy abrupta.

Could be disputed, negative reviews may actually be informative if you're into the art style, let's say, but later become frustrated due to simplicity in design (point & click). The game's design mirrors older PC adventure point & clicks, yet manages to innovate in spots. I don't have much time in the game, but many of the puzzles were satisfying in ways difficult to articulate, probably having to do with nostalgic appreciation from days and nights of yore spent with the Quest for Glory series, Day of the Tentacle, Zak McKracken, et al. \n\nDropsy's opaque logic meshed with its heartfelt, satirical, innocent, menacing narrative and graphical presentation in ways I found extremely unique and masterful. I'm only giving you my impression really, I understand that may not be particularly informative, but if you can catch it on sale, I'd say go for it - Always the option to refund below 2 hours accumulated. There can be points where the game's internal logic becomes a bit nonsensical, or narrative elements come off as unlikeable for whatever reason. I won't stear around valid criticisms other people have brought up, regardless of giving a positive review. \n\nWill have to finish Dropsy, then add/subtract to the review, provide some final impressions and whatnot.

The game is most certainly different, it goes against the mechanical and formulaic staples that most games go for now and days.The creators weren\u2019t afraid to go against the grain or to make something unique. They did what they felt like doing and I must say it turned out wonderful. \n\nIn the game you play as a peculiar looking clown named Dropsy, he is always happy no matter what, walking around with his huge carefree grin. You also can control several companions you will find along his adventure that serve not only as friends but tools in solving puzzles or to retrieve certain items from locations which are impossible for Dropsy to reach himself.\n\nDropsy the game conveys it story without using dialogue of any kind, rather it utilize an imagery system over every character\u2019s speech bubble. By doing this you can immerse yourself into the game no matter what language you speak. It sounds strange but trust me once you get into the game it will feel natural. The world seems to not be Earth or at least set in an alternate universe seeing how the natives use an unknown alphabet.   \n\nThe goal in Dropsy is to save your ill father, while on the journey you spread joy and happiness to everyone you meet with many sidequest you come across. There is even a mechanic of hugging people which actually feels satisfying. It put a smile on my face every time I used it. There are some parts of the game that nearly made me tear up. Who knew a game without words would do that to a person, well Dropsy sure did. Several heart tugging scenes throughout. On the other hand, there are some parts of the game that can turn a bit dark and nightmarish, keep in mind before picking it up for young ones.\n\nGameplay is in the style of a point and click adventure game, you click the location to where you want to walk and then interact with the world around you. Was pretty nostalgic for me. You will also collect many items throughout. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[h1] Pros [/h1]\n- Great Story\n- Unique Gameplay \n- Dropsy Himself\n- Art Style/Visuals\n- No Language Required\n\n[h1] Cons [/h1]\n- Bit of a plot dump near end\n- Point of no return for collecting certain items so be sure to create a new save slot before the third act\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nIt\u2019s a fun game if you\u2019d like to play something different than what everyone else is playing, kick your shoes off and dip your feet into the world of Dropsy.", "timestamp_created": 1507481067, "timestamp_updated": 1507519150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594575", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35541577": {"recommendationid": "35541577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083871085", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496336198}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc8fc\uc778\uacf5 \uc6c0\uc9c1\uc77c\ub54c \ub098\ub294 \uc18c\ub9ac \uc88b\uc74c\n\uac15\uc544\uc9c0,\uc950,\uc0c8 \uadc0\uc5ec\uc6c0\n\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac \ub530\ub73b\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud6c4\ubc18\uc740 \uc0ac\uc7a5 \uac1cxx\n\ub3c8 \uc544\uae5d\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c", "timestamp_created": 1507375511, "timestamp_updated": 1507375511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35528837": {"recommendationid": "35528837", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106862013", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507320783}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Envolvente Point-and-click cuja hist\u00f3ria se desenrola n\u00e3o-verbalmente.

I wanted to go back and find what i missed unfortunately i did not have a game save before then and the game is very tedious if you already know what is going to happen. big let down :\\ I would say the game was enjoyable before that but the enjoyment i got out of the game was the build up in events and the feeling that i was about to discover something huge but I didn't and it left a sour taste in my mouth", "timestamp_created": 1506712663, "timestamp_updated": 1506712663, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501505", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35280762": {"recommendationid": "35280762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076579033", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495313637}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Pedazo de historia \n10/10 Muy buen jogo", "timestamp_created": 1506654928, "timestamp_updated": 1506654928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35203108": {"recommendationid": "35203108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044132036", "num_games_owned": 368, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452058637}, "language": "english", "review": "Warm, comforting, and a little moist. \n\nYou might expect, just like I did, from looking at this game, with its strange-looking clown protagonist and psychedelic atmosphere, to contain some subversive narrative, or that it's secretly a horror game. I thought there at least might be some predictable twist that Dropsy is a serial murderer, or a monster, or god knows what else. But it defied my expectations. While there are many dark themes running throughout this game, and a number of twists, Dropsy himself is pure-hearted.\n\nIt'd also be easy to pass this game off as just being too simple, sappy and over-sentimental, teaching you the same old things you learned in Sunday school; Don't judge a book by its cover, be nice to others, and so on. The game is about those things, yes, but it does it in a way that, at least to me, felt genuine.\n\nDropsy does a lot of things that fans of point and click adventures should enjoy. While there is a plotline to follow, the main thrust of the game is wandering around the world, meeting its inhabitants, and getting them to let you hug them. However, almost everyone you meet has some kind of problem, and one way or another are in a non-hugging mood. You solve their problem, then get to huggin'. All the dialogue they give you is done by representative pictures and symbols, which both help demonstrate Dropsy's loose grasp on language, and also make the thankfully simple puzzles a little more challenging, since you might not fully understand them at first. Many of these puzzles can only be solved once you have an item or a companion from doing the main story, but the rest you can solve at your own pace, and aren't required to finish the game. It's rare to see a game, especially a point and click adventure one, where you genuinely just help people out. It's a nice feeling, wandering back over familiar areas, and seeing a character you helped earlier in better spirits. Hell, you can even hug them again if you'd like.\n\nWhat mainly will determine if you'll enjoy Dropsy is its presentation. Personally I found the artstyle quite charming, and each character is animated quite well. The soundtrack also really appeals to me, having a good variety between upbeat, bouncy tunes and softer, more atmospheric melodies. In The Court of the Junkyard King is a particular favorite of mine. The soundtrack is what seals the deal on this game for me, so keep in mind it's also available separately if you're interested.\n\nOverall, it's a simple, charming experience with a unique personality and style.

I strongly recommend not looking up anything about the game and diving right in. Just know that the story is rich, characters diverse, yet the gameplay is simple with puzzles sprinkled throughout. Difficulty is not too high while not being easy. Granted, there are many straightforward aspects, while some tasks will leave you scratching your head and grumbling. \n\n\tAs you progress, the ability to solve problems and finish missions is increased as Dropsy becomes more efficient. I won\u2019t explain exactly how that happens, but with any natural game progression, that tends to be the case.\n\n\tThe soundtrack is soothing yet unsettling at times. I found myself looking up various songs to listen to after finishing the game because they\u2019re just so great.\n\n\tWait for a sale. And if you desire a relaxing point and click that will make you smile, laugh, and raise your brow, Dropsy is for you! Oh! And you get to hug people and it makes them happy and Dropsy even happier! However, some people do not like being hugged, and they will let you know.

I really do.  There are a lot of things I like about it.  The character is interesting and lovable despite the fact that he is an ugly potato that can come off rather creepy.  The humor is great and the art style is even greater (especially if you like pixel graphics).  The story is interesting and blends horror and comedy just right.  The map is rather big as well which is annoying for travel but great for exploration.  \n\nDespite all these pros and more, I just...I got bored.  I got bored fairly fast and I wish I didn't.  Not enough was happening fast enough.  The goal of the game is to make friends with the inhabitants of this world (because they all hate you) and to give them hugs.  I love that goal, it's adorable, but not enough mystery was unfolding early enough in the game for me and the goal was too simple.  I don't know how the rest of the game pans out - perhaps it gets better and more exciting.  But for as far as I've played the story is slow, the quests are slow, the goal is too simplistic, and the result is boredom.  I reccomend trying this game but I cannot promise satisfaction.\n\nEven so, I commend the creators for a well-made artistical and unique experience.  This is not a poor game it just...lost it's luster too fast for me.", "timestamp_created": 1498278596, "timestamp_updated": 1498278596, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540990", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32709412": {"recommendationid": "32709412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088774880", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498495409}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Simplesmente espetacular!

But lucky for both of us a kind sir or madam wrote up a great guide here on Steam, I had to peek a couple times but it was mostly very intuitive.\n\nI'd hug the SHIT out of Dropsy if I ever met him...\n\n10 out of 5 would play again", "timestamp_created": 1496893397, "timestamp_updated": 1496893397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530612", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32242766": {"recommendationid": "32242766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048336909", "num_games_owned": 474, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496942997}, "language": "english", "review": "Dropsy is a clown that folks around town are wrong about! \nWhen I first saw this game I wasn't quite sure how to feel about it.

I don't mean to be rude by saying that but that's how I see him. The game is a really different from most games. There's no text anywhere in the game at all witch is really cool and playing and your trying to earn the trust back of all the towns people and hug them and all is right in the world!

When you're a large jiggling monster with noodles for arms, no one seems to respect you. But that's fine. Dropsy won't let that get him down. He's equipped with his ultimate weapon of friendship: a hug.\n\nBut be careful, Dropsy. It isn't as simple as just giving someone a hug. Ok, sometimes it is, but sometimes there are more complex problems going on. The vortex of misery spares no one in this faux reality of letters swapped out for Russian moon runes; where the days are short, and everyone is addicted to the hard stuff, like ice cream and cigarettes.\n\nDropsy is more expressive in one hour of gameplay than the vast majority of other video games' entire run time. The first thing that struck me while playing was the music. And whoda thunk it, real instruments can have a big impact on the tone of a video game if they're used right. Sort of like panting with as many colors as possible vs choosing to paint in black and white shades of generic slav discotec beats and royalty free xylophone music. The difference is night and day, and goodness is Dropsy good at utilizing its strengths. Personally, I was on the verge of tears for just how melancholy the first couple hours of this game turns out to be. It's telling how one of the first areas you go to is a graveyard.\n\nThe thing is: Dropsy doesn't ever ask you to be sad. Sure, there are some serious themes at play here, provided you know what you're looking for. But the fact that everything is presented in such a vibrant, easygoing way; sort of fills the void of misery the game is trying to paint. None of these characters want to be here. None of these characters are happy. They're all feeling terrible, and they all have problems of their own on top of problems where they live. Most everything in Dropsy is in a state of disrepair. Roads are broken up. Fences are tattered. Stores are decayed and depressing. The game itself does a very good job at inspiring you to bring some light back to these people. The way I see it is, Dropsy is Dark Souls: Prepare to Hug Edition.\n\nThe mechanics of the game itself are interesting. Aside from the standard point and click theology of take everything that isn't nailed down; understanding the day and night cycle and what it means for these characters is required for game completion. Certain people show up at different places at different times. This means that puzzles are only solvable at certain times. Other times, game progression is tied to showing the right thing to the right person to get a clue what's going on. Everyone speaks in pictures in this game, so sometimes it can be challenging to interpret what anyone means; probably intentional on the game designer's part.\n\nThis is a game that's a little on the shorter side. But I'd consider it particularly fruitful considering how much work was put into the atmosphere of this game. Being everyone's friend is tough work, but its certainly not impossible in Dropsy. The game moves along steadily as long as you think like Dropsy. It's a very fun, colorful experience that doesn't shy away from being interesting and poignant. As long as you're capable of feeling, this game will show you a great time.\n", "timestamp_created": 1496714023, "timestamp_updated": 1496714023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525577", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32211684": {"recommendationid": "32211684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149689209", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496509458}, "language": "english", "review": "So much better than I anticipated.

That's... basically the lot of it, there are some deeper plotlines that are hanging around in the background, but the gist of your motivation is \"make people happy so you can hug them,\" but it executes the concept so well that it just works, the phrase \"elegance in simplicity\" comes to mind.\nIt's all the good things of a point and click distilled into their purest form, it is a lean, satisfying short experience devoid of unnecessary filler. There aren't even any legible words in the game, everything is told with pictures and illustrations (I believe the implication is that Dropsy has the mind/worldview of a child and can't read), but it's usually fairly clear what you're supposed to do, and it's thankfully free of the \"adventure game logic\" that plauges many games of this genera, the puzzles are all logical and with one or two exceptions I'd say you could absolutely 100% this game with no hints. The art style and tone is bright and colourful, but simultaniously creepy and macabre (this game goes some pretty dark places, especially towards the end), and I adore the aesthetic, I'm a fan of pixel art done well, and this is some good stuff.\nAlso, I've gotta comment on the sountrack, I love it, it's consistantly upbeat and relaxing (most of the tracks wouldn't feel out of place in a Kirby game), it fits the tone of the game perfectly.\n\nThe best way to sum this this game up is that it's a childrens game for adults, and I mean that in the best possible way.\nThere is legitimately almost nothing I disliked about this game, I liked it so much that I burned through almost all of it one sitting, and if that ain't a reccomendation I don't know what is.\nI give it two malformed nub things up!", "timestamp_created": 1496697438, "timestamp_updated": 1496697438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657543", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32148063": {"recommendationid": "32148063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198391365050", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496282581}, "language": "english", "review": "I watched a YT LP months ago and couldn't stop thinking about how much fun the game seemed to be, with its funky graphics and its heartwarming story.

I plan on writing a far more detailed review once I'm finished[/spoiler]\n\"So far I have neither had to consult a walkthrough nor found the obstacles too easy to overcome. And based on my experience so far I'd rate the experience as at least equal, perhaps even greater than the first time I played Monkey Island 2. It's that good.\"\n\n\"Although it does use the slightly awkward adventure game mechanic where there is no actual dialogue, so the comparison to Monkey Island is purely qualitative.\"\n\nI was initially a little disgruntled when I realised that this was an adventure with no actual dialogue. But I found I quickly picked up the logic in the pictographic style of communication this game uses. And I have heard said many times that a reasonable percentage of face to face communication is non-verbal, and I the pictographs often express various emotions.\n\nAnd the protagonist does appear to be an itinerant circus performer, so I guess there's the possibility that he does not speak the language. And speaking of language, this also means that they don't have to make different versions for different countries and that can only be a good thing in my opinion even though I am lucky enough to speak English natively.\n\nI was also mildly annoyed that I could not jump to locations on the, addmittedly quite useful and easy to navigate, map. That is until I unlocked the car, which wasn't very far into the game really, and I felt a little ashamed that I had judjed this game so harshly, as this is perhaps one of the most flowing, engaging, funny, melodramatic, and well, just about any other word you could think of to describe desired qualities in an adventure games plot's games I've ever played.\n\nMaybe hardened adventurers might find it a little easy, I find it mildly challenging myself. But then as I've mentioned, I'm the kind of adventurer who usually needs to consult some kind of walkthrough at least once or twice. But even then it's still an attractive and engaging story so even if you do find it a pushover it would still be reasonably entertaining.\n\nYou seem to score points by giving people hugs, and when you're controlling your faithful pet dog, urinating on fire hydrants. I found this mildly amusing, and gives a nice diversion to the main plot. And speaking of plots, there also seem to be numerous sub plots which parhaps aren't necessary, but unlock places to sleep. Which come in handy as this game features time passing from day to night, which is a mild inconvinience at times, but didn't bother me really. And also I don't think I've found any obstacles that are time sensitive, everybody's pretty much wherever they were at the same time yesterday.\n\nThis game is definitely worthy of at least 9.1, but maybe by the time I've finished I ight even go as high as 9.3 out of 10", "timestamp_created": 1488263392, "timestamp_updated": 1488263863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513627", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30210453": {"recommendationid": "30210453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287225798", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488056260}, "language": "english", "review": "Dropsy is a fun game.

I had no expectations about this game except that I wasn't sure if I wanted to play it or if this was gonna be something I would enjoy. So with that in mind took it a while for me before I decided to give it a shot and see what it was. But what I didn't know was that those thoughts belongs nowhere near Dropsy the clown. This is one of those games that you are gonna question a lot of the choices you make as well as why you are making them. Why am I, a creepy clown guy going around and hugging people for no particular reason. I\u2019m just strolling around town hugging everything in a miles radius and most likely scaring people or making them uncomfortable so why am I doing this. The answer is very simple because that is not what's happening. Happiness has many ways of being created and shown and I personally believe and absolutely love the power of hugging and think it's one the best things to life. So seeing a game with a happy guy going around and making other people happy, funny enough made me happy :D and made me smile.\n\nThe story is truly unique especially since I haven't heard a lot of clown stories in my lifetime. And this shows that a great story can come from everywhere, any environment, any man or woman and any kind of hearth. This weird clown shows how something as simple as a hug can make someone happy and that life is easier with a smile. \nOther than the deeper meaning of life are there the great artstyle and animations of this game. It has a great sense of humor and since the game is without any actual dialog are they able to create great visual telling and giving a clear picture of what's going on and how the people around you feel. They also use some very fitting and very descent music to make the experience more engaging and captivating and sculpt the story so they create a perfect harmonization to the environment. \n\nThis game is nothing short of a great experience and I really enjoyed my time playing this game. It really showed me something great and told a beautiful story and a really well-crafted one of its kind.

nominee for \"Villian most in need of a hug\" award 2016.\n\nUm, what can I say.  This is a fantastic indy adventure game.  The storytelling manages to capture emotion and make you empathize with a protagonist and characters in a way I haven't seen too often.  I also have to say, I haven't met a protagonist as admirably selfless as Dropsy in a long, long time.  If you enjoy adventure games or want to find good and imaginative storytelling experiences, this is a game that belongs in your library.\n\nThe game follows the story of Dropsy, an overweight, horrifying looking clown who is so mentally disabled he can't speak except to laugh or mumble, writing looks like unintelligable squiggles to him, and he can't understand a single thing other people say.  The story begins on the anniversary of a tragic accident he caused which resulted in the death of his mother and affected everyone in the city around him.\n\nThere are only a few ways you interact with the world around you.  The most useless, is speaking since you can only understand generally what they are saying and everything comes out as unintelligible.  The second, is by using the assortment of items you find.  Third, is by having several animal friends you make interact with them.  Finally, and most usefully is hugging - you should hug everything.\n\nThe puzzles for the main story are not too complicated and you should have no problems figuring out where to go and what to do.  The real meat and most enjoyable part of the game are the interactions you have with NPC's on the side and solving their problems, the game does quite a bit to push you to these people.  Dropsy has this interesting gift to see how depressed people are around him and the game nudges you to do something about it - since Dropsy wants to do nothing more than make the world a better place.  The result is almost always heartwarming and satisfying to watch.  Finishing these side missions and finding out how connected all the people in the world are to each other and how they connect back to you is more rewarding than the story itself and makes the story that much more enjoyable.\n\nThe game isn't without its problems, the pointing and clicking can sometimes be a little off and the soundtrack can sometimes be a little...grating.

That's certainly the case with Dropsy, an otherwise creepy clown chock full of child-like wonder. His circus may have burned down but he soldiers on with his clown dad and clown puppy as best he can, dispensing hugs to anyone who'll have them. Starting with humble tasks he soon finds himself embroiled in the machinations of some powerful people in his surreal world. Navigating your way through all this madness takes a lot of item hunting, a lot of experimenting, and a lot of hugs.\n\nThe first thing you need to know about Dropsy is that it's an adventure game with no text. Dropsy himself can't speak or read, but he can get the general gist from people. This means there's no dialogue in the game, just lots of illustrated bubbles showing items or emotions. Similarly the notes and signs throughout the world appear to be garbled nonsense, but are actually written in a substitution language you can decipher with enough effort. These elements give the game a more alien feel, appropriate when playing as an unfortunate and misunderstood clown.\n\nMore than that, though, the world of Dropsy is one of the more bizarre ones to be found among adventure games. From the familiar forest you start in, you'll travel to a desert junk fort, a biomedical megacorp, a viking enclave, and stranger places still. The people who inhabit these places are just as weird and colorful but tend to have familiar needs, like money or flowers or just a lumpy shoulder to cry on. Dropsy can also communicate with animals and gathers a small menagerie to help him, each with their own puzzle-solving specialty like the doggie's helpful digging. It's a surreal game that only gets moreso as you progress, and part of the challenge is figuring out how everything relates.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the alien feel makes this a more confusing adventure than most. The pictorial language makes the items or actions you need quite clear, but finding those items or performing those actions in a world that doesn't always make sense can be a challenge. As clear as the wordless dialogue is, it makes it harder to remember what you're supposed to be doing. For me at least, text and words stick in my mind a lot longer than icons. Dropsy's world is also wide open from the start, giving you dozens of scenes to wander around when you only need to be focusing on a handful. It reminds me a lot of older LucasArts adventures, which for all of their humor and freedom could make it quite hard to know what you're supposed to do.\n\nOn the bright side, toddling around the countryside will reveal plenty of interesting places and things to do. The main plotline in Dropsy is tight and direct but there's a boatload of sidequests to take on if you like. Dropsy has a dedicated hug command and can use it on just about everything remotely sentient, but most require some kind of item or assistance before they'll allow a damp embrace. Your pup has things to pee on, and there are cassettes and other collectibles to find. You can spend a lot of time in Dropsy's world exploring and solving, and it's bound to be charming enough to keep you going.\n\nThe graphics are plenty familiar pixel art but taken to adorable new heights with vibrant colors and creative designs. Scenes are a joy to look at and every character has their unique flair. Dropsy himself is such a pleasure to watch in action, bouncing around town, waving his noodley arms, and spasming with joy at the simplest triumphs. The soundtrack is solid as well, featuring some very fitting, atmospheric tracks. It's really a solid adventure game from top to bottom, just one that'll take a little more effort than what you might be accustomed to. But as charming and touching as it can be, I guarantee it's worth the effort.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

coulrophobia this game might change that.\nDropsy is a wonderful graphic-adventure with an equally heartwarming message about preconceptions and the power of kindness.\nThe lovable protagonist, Dropsy, is a disturbingly ugly yet innocent and caring clown who, despite the townies' general dislikeness of him because of a tragic accident, does his best to help them all. Thus, by mere acts of altruism, Dropsy is capable of gradually changing the hostility of his surrounding world into a friendly environment and switch the folks' negative opinions by showing them his warm and gentle personality.\nDropsy has moved me deeply, and coming from me and my generally cynical way of thinking, that is really saying something. The game is not sentimental in any way (\"sentimental\" as in \"excessively cheesy\"), it doesn't tell you how you should feel about something or force you into a certain \"moral\" path. You can help people feel better or you can go straight to the main story (although the former is the whole point of the game) So, if like me, you are allergic to melodrama, worry not.

Instead, speech is conveyed through small pictographs such as a thumbs-up for approval or a pair of legs for \u201cgo\u201d.

It\u2019s very important to check out all of the game\u2019s areas in both night and day so you don\u2019t miss anything, as there are puzzles that can only be solved at certain times of day. Eventually you will gain a troupe of animal allies that can help you to solve puzzles and retrieve items, each with their own advantages.\n\nThe visuals and music in this game are both bizarre and surprisingly well executed for a retro-themed title and the amount of soul they add to the overall experience is reminiscent of older LucasArts point and click games where you would feel like something changed inside of you after finishing them. This is amazing when you consider the fact that the game has no real dialogue but still manages to entertain and challenge the player.\n\nI don\u2019t have any bad things to say about Dropsy.

A few years earlier Dropsy was blamed for an uncontrollable circus fire that claimed many lives, including his mothers. This influenced a negative opinion of Dropsy within the community. He now lives with his father in what remains of the circus. His father's heath is failing and works for a greedy junk yard owner. Day in and day out, his father fails to satisfy his boss until one day Dropsy's father falls extremely ill and cannot continue working. With no money for medication, things are looking dark for Dropsy and company. \n\nAt least that's how I believe the game begins. There's no dialogue or legible text in the game, so you're kinda on your own to connect what happens. During gameplay, instead of talking, speech bubbles appear above a character's head displaying their mood, opinion of Dropsy and what they desire. I found this style of communication to work really well, making you feel like more of an outsider. It makes it difficult to connect with the world and alienates you as a player. The story is simultaneously cute and dark; funny, yet tragic. There are many hidden objects and pictures to find that bring more emotional depth and weight to the overall story. And it's pretty good. You'll find more if you take the time to help out other individuals that aren't required to finish the game. Admittedly, I was moved several times.  \n\nIt's also fun to play no doubt. If you liked those Lucas Arts adventure games, specifically Sam and Max Hit the Road, you'll probably enjoy this. The gameplay is all about looking at stuff, collecting items and figuring out who to give it to or what's the best time to use it. The logic of the puzzles sometimes hinges on cartoonish, and that may put some players off. Dropsy plays off of old mechanics of point and click adventures, but also brings many new ideas to the genera. I would recommend this game to people who actively enjoy playing point and click adventures. I'll also say this is a good one to try out if you've been looking to dip into the genera.

The second trailer makes the came a little more twisted/creepy than it is.\n2.--Characters: Not a single spoken word or a line of immediately legible text is needed to feel for almost each and every character in this game. Honestly, this game is a great example of such.\n3.--Hugs? The first game where hugging is your 'most powerful weapon.' Dropsy is full of legit love right there. Pure of heart and all that without being nauseating-ly sappy or saccharine. \n4.--Difficulty: Overall? Just right. Easy for minimal effort, slightly harder to 100%. I got delayed on about two puzzles, but nothing that ruined the pacing of the game.\n5.--The ride: After the opening, it's a little slow to start. After that, it's colorful, full of feels, moments of raised eyebrows and creepy things. The only time it got dull was when you couldn't warp to other places, but then they give you an option to do that too and it goes right back to being awesome. The ending is incredibly satisfying.

It has little features that don\u2019t seem like much but I actually quite enjoyed.\n\nFor example, this is a classic point and click game with various puzzles involving the towns people. As per usual in a point and click if you want something from someone you\u2019re going to have to do them a favour first. That\u2019s pretty standard, but this game throws in the extra level of thinking by adding in a day to night cycle. Some people are in different places depending on what time of day it is and others may not even be around at all until a certain time. \nIt\u2019s an interesting way to add to the puzzle of the game.\n\nSomething else that I thought added to the game was the communication between you and the characters. I have to admit that as much as I adore point and click adventure games, sometimes the long blocks of dialogue can get on my nerves. \nThis game lets you understand characters, their needs and their emotions just from little pictures and signs. In terms of story, you find things and figure things out for yourself more so then the characters waffling on at you. If they want something, If something is wrong, if they feel a particular way, you\u2019ll know by the signs they use. Someone wants you to go somewhere and talk to someone? They\u2019ll use a picture of legs in motion, a picture of a place, a picture of someone speaking and a picture of who to talk to. It\u2019s simple, but effective and somehow enjoyable. \n\nThe graphics in this game definitely brings balance in my opinion. You can tell that this game has a slightly sinister and peculiar quality to it. The bright, upbeat, minimalistic pixel graphics give it a bit more of a light hearted feel despite the story being about an extremely creepy (yet loveable) and maybe a little deranged clown whose mother died in a circus tent fire. The almost cartoon-like animation on Dropsy being a perfect example of that.\n\nWhen you start this game, everyone and everything seems to hate you. Part of this games charm is that you can choose to help and win over everyone in the game by solving their problems and doing them favours. I liked this feature of the game as it extends our creepy little clowns personality a little. He may look horrifying but really he\u2019s a sweet and helpful little chubby monkey. \n\nIn terms of achievements this game wasn\u2019t too bad. In the 9 hours that I played I played through the game once with great detail on the characters and once kind of half way through to sweep up left over achievements. \n\nAll in all really I adored this game. It was very fun and I\u2019d definitely give anything else this developer came out with a go. If you are a fan of the genre definitely try this one. \n\n\nTL;DR : Unique with some interesting features such as a day to night cycle and communication through pictures. Great graphics, a loveable character, not too bad to 100% and generally a decent play for those who enjoy the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1473542545, "timestamp_updated": 1473542545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598041", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25450010": {"recommendationid": "25450010", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988141888", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473039475}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is wonderful in every way!\nIt's very well designed, it has a strong, lovable personality and a supricingly compelling story.\nIt might even be the best point and click game ive ever played!", "timestamp_created": 1473538988, "timestamp_updated": 1473538988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25414667": {"recommendationid": "25414667", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008377145", "num_games_owned": 788, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473359882}, "language": "english", "review": "sad, sweet, and beautiful.

Gameplay usually isn't too challenging and has a lot of variety. The art is fantastic and colorful, despite the ugly or creepy subjects it sometimes depicts. The strange, depressing but heartwarming atmosphere is truly unique, and the music is wonderful. There were some slightly bothersome elements, like the difficult-to-keep-track-of day/night cycle, and the often lengthy treks around the large map(this is partly alleviated later in the story, when *fast travel* is unlocked). The completely pictoral dialogue, clues, and even the menus were sometimes tough to decipher as well. I found all this to be pretty overlookable, though.\n\nI enjoyed the game thoroughly until the final act, when I was hit with a really, REALLY weird twist that came out of absolutely nowhere. It left me with a really bad taste in my mouth.

Tomas el rol de Dropsy, un payaso particular que empieza una extra\u00f1a aventura despu\u00e9s de un accidente en el circo donde trabajaba. Despu\u00e9s del incidente, todo el mundo odia a Dropsy, pero esto no detendra a Dropsy de hacer lo que m\u00e1s le gusta... dar abrazos y hacer que la gente se sienta feliz. \n\nComo todo point-and-click, el objetivo es resolver distintos puzzles a trav\u00e9s de items e interactuando con los elementos del entorno. El juego maneja diversas m\u00e9canicas que dependen del personaje que uses (si, Dropsy tiene diferentes acompa\u00f1antes con distintas habilidades) o de la hora del d\u00eda (d\u00eda o noche). Algo interesante del juego, es que transmite muy bien las ideas de los personajes mediante dibujos, nada de texto, por lo que el idioma no debe ser un problema para jugar el t\u00edtulo.\n\nNo soy fan\u00e1tico de este genero, de hecho, es uno de los generos que menos me gusta, pero la historia que ofrece el t\u00edtulo me motivo para terminarlo a pesar de haber necesitado una gu\u00eda, ya que a pesar de que el juego maneja una l\u00f3gica algo sencilla, la baja resoluci\u00f2n del t\u00edtulo hace d\u00edficil saber con que puedes interactuar y que es o no es realmente algo del background. A parte de que maneja una resoluci\u00f3n gr\u00e1fica bastante baja, me ha gustado el pixel art del t\u00edtulo, y el apartado sonoro esta aceptable para la t\u00e9matica del t\u00ectulo.\n\nEl juego no es muy largo, y me alegro que sea asi, me tomo alrrededor de 4 horas acabarlo. Pienso que podr\u00eda haberle sacado una o dos horas m\u00e1s si me pusiera a hacer felices a todos los sujetos de este mundo, pero como mencione, la dificultad para diferenciar los elementos interactuables no me motiva a hacerlo. Me hubiera gustado que el final del juego hubiera sido m\u00e1s complejo, pero bueno, es un bonito plot twist.\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, dado que el t\u00edtulo tiene un precio bajo, es MUY recomendado para los amantes del genero. Para los que son como yo, que no les mata mucho el genero pero gustan de historias bizarras, es recomendado para conseguir con descuento y tener una gu\u00eda a la mano en los momentos de que se sientan perdidos.

Most of the solutions make sense but its a matter of paying attention and having a good memory.\n\nalso movement speed is slow and it makes going from location to location kind of a pain early game. you do eventually get fast travel by going thru the main plot until a certain point. i recommend focusing on that before exploring outside town more than you have to, because boy does fast travel help things along, and any side thing can wait till then.\n\nobtuseness and slow moments were the roots of the main reservations i had going into dropsy, and point n clicks in general, but im glad i saw it through to the end. jay tholen put his heart into this and you ought to buy it to see it for yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1470201629, "timestamp_updated": 1471362207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498008", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24678998": {"recommendationid": "24678998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083209603", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473441872}, "language": "polish", "review": "Nie boi si\u0119 klaun\u00f3w:Lumberjack\n\nKlauny nie raz przerarzaja w tym wypadku jest odwrotnie.\n\nDropsy to gra point-and-clickowa w kt\u00f3rej chodzimy klaunem kt\u00f3ry ma spodnie na szelkach.Klaun zwie si\u0119 Dropsy i pragnie on okazywa\u0107 mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107 wszystkim w oko\u0142o.\nNa swojej drodze spotyka wiernych przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 psa,mysz,piskle.

Dropsy really pulled me in with its atmosphere that was both foreboding and light-hearted at the same time. The nightmarish beginning draws the player right into the world of Dropsy and keeps them guessing whether the plot will develop into a horror story with you being the monster or maybe something else entirely.\n\nThe game pulls something off brilliantly that few games dare today, and that is to tell a story without words. Dialog is presented in pictograms only and they are so well-designed that it is a lot of fun guessing what the characters are saying. I played the whole thing through in one sitting and was motivated enough to try and solve the puzzles myself, even when I was stuck. This was largely due to the fact that there are a lot of optional tasks you can do when stuck and some of them may lead you to places that get you back on track for the main story.\n\nThese days it's been getting more and more difficult to find an indie game that actually bothers setting the mood, creating a dense atmosphere and bringing something new to the table. Dropsy was a nice surprise in that regard and has been one of the best story-based games I've played this year.\n\nThere may be some quirks in the game mechanics that may put sensitive players off, but if you are used to old school adventure games and enjoyed some of the newer indie adventure games then you should be pretty much used to the other imperfection. And really, overall the game was super stable for me, so I didn't get the feeling I was stuck due to a bug.\n\nMy only gripe is that I bought it cheaply off a sale, because Dropsy is worth every penny.\nI really feel like buying it again and gifting it to someone who can appreciate it.", "timestamp_created": 1468629811, "timestamp_updated": 1468629811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24337550": {"recommendationid": "24337550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085578350", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468602128}, "language": "polish", "review": "Dropsy to wybitna gra przygodowa point and click.

Dropsy, in its own way, feels insanely more human than any of us, which we are already lost in hate and overall discomfort of society.\n\nOn the negative side, I feel a bit disappointed with the gameplay itself: I thought Dropsy was going to experiment with some kind of new modes on how to develop the story, but the branching is quite linear and standard. Yet, Dropsy innovates with its surrealistic storytelling and non-verbal communication (though already done by Botanicula and probably others before).\n\nAnd I [i]have[/i] to mention the superb OST made by Chris Schlarb.

To give you an idea of how bad the ending is without spoiling anything; the main antagonist is only revealed within the last 5 minutes of gameplay.

It is not a perfect game, but the love that was put into this game is so charming and beautiful that I am more than willing to overlook its flaws. Dropsy is a 2D point and click adventure game very reminiscent in style to the old Lucasarts games like Day of the Tentacle and the Curse of Monkey Island. The story is about a circus clown who's mother died during a fire which burned down the tent where they performed. You befriend a cast of animal companions who go around town trying to help people in return for hugs.  There is distinct feeling of tension in the game as to the nature of Dropsy. Dropsy is visually scary, but he seems to just want to give hugs to everything (and anything) he meets. This is further obfuscated by the use of pictograms in lieu of text dialog to convery the speech in this game. I found the use of pictograms to be an interesting choice that for the most part worked, allowing the player to fill in the narrative themselves, but at some times confused me as to what they meant. The main innovations are what they call an open world where you can essentially travel to any location in the world at any time and the addition of a day/night cycle which changes in real-time. I found these design choices to be interesting but tended to make the game more difficult towards the mid to late game where some critical person may only be available at a certain location at a certain time of day. The game difficulty starts out fairly simple, yet enjoyable and then quickly ramps up towards the end where a lot of logical jumps a-la-LucasArts games are required.

O objetivo de Dropsy passa a voltar(ou come\u00e7ar) a ser amado por todos, enquanto ele questiona seu pr\u00f3prio lado sombrio.\n\n+ Tem\u00e1tica bem executada.\n+ Personagens bizarros e cativantes.\n+ Hist\u00f3ria se desenrola bem.\n\nO jogo tem uma trilha sonora leve, personagens bem estilizados e muita cor. As situa\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o c\u00f4micas/ador\u00e1veis at\u00e9 o momento em que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o, e esse \u00e9 o seu ponto mais forte. Por se achar culpado na trag\u00e9dia, por vezes Dropsy pode se enxergar em outras dimens\u00f5es, transformando o simp\u00e1tico palhacinho num Primo N\u00e3o Muito Distante do Pennywise (De It). Esses momentos s\u00e3o breves, mas impactantes.\n\nDe resto, o jogo \u00e9 igual a qualquer outro adventure point-n-click. Pegue um item e d\u00ea pra tal pessoa que voc\u00ea vai ter a rea\u00e7\u00e3o necess\u00e1ria para avan\u00e7ar por ali e pegar o item que \u00e9 pra ser dado pra tal pessoa e por a\u00ed vai.

It starts off with you making your way out a burning tent only to later awaken in a bed realizing it was a dream. Even so you will quickly notice that the actual world is just as weird as your dreams and everyone in it is depressed. It is up to you to bring joy back into their lives, shockingly enough for such an evil locking clown. Your only real means of interaction is opening up your inventory and mashing an item into an object or person in hopes of some kind of result. Dropsy has very little in the way of hand-holding and no tutorial so it is up to you to explore this pretty large open world in search of random objects that may lead to opening up a new area or just making someone happy. \n\nSounds simple enough but there is not a single word when talking to characters instead they talk in a made up language and express themselves via speech bubbles containing a vague few pictures in them. It is up to you to decipher what is ailing them and finding some way to put a smile on their face which can range from giving them a simple hug to finding their father. It is easier said than done as you will gather up quite a bit of items in your inventory in no time and the solution is very rarely near the target. There is no way to lose, get hurt or die in this game so it is all a matter of patience and brain power. Fast traveling is unlocked near the end of the game and only then for a brief time meaning you will spend a lot of your time walking around to your destination. It is both a blessing and a curse as you will often times find something you missed your first time going through yet it does get slightly irradiating as Dropsy is move fast and the world is pretty large. \n\nAccompanying since the beginning will be your loyal puppy that is equally as creepy as Dropsy. He will follow you wherever you go and can dig up items as well as sniff out important objects. Two more pets will join you as the game progresses. A mouse to fit into tiny areas and a baby bird to reach objects that are out of reach. You can control any of them at any time so if you are stuck it is likely you are not examining the area closely enough for things seemingly insignificant things like a crack in the wall or a vent. These extra skill sets available to you make the game feel far more involving as you are not just looking for an item but how to best utilize your characters in the environment you are in. The world itself is quite odd featuring downed planes, vampire hunters and aliens. Though this is a game about playing as a 500 pound demonic looking clown out to hug everything from trees to said aliens so I guess it's to be expected. \n\nHugging people and making them happy rarely have any benefits for you other than the occasional achievement or important item. At the start everyone hates you but as you make them happy the only thing that really changes is them having a smiley face speech bubble when you pass by. Dropsy features a day and night cycle that has time advancing as you switch between areas. Different events occur during the night so it's not just a meaningless feature and can be the clue to solving a problem if you are stuck. There are a few beds scattered around the world that allow you to pick what time of day you want to skip to but they are far between and a simple wait for X amount of time option would have been preferable. Speaking of options the menus also follow that no text rule meaning it is just a weird mess of symbols annoyingly enough. You can save the game using the floppy disc with red arrow symbol which is useful to know if you don't want to rely on the autosave feature or want multiple saves.\n\nMusic ranges from jazz to other solemn melodies that makes the grim world of Dropsy feel even more strange and  depressing. I'm sure there is a story that surely puts meaning to this madness but it completely flew over my head and I left probably even more confused than when I started. Puzzles are simple enough though often times obscure in what needs to be done. The real challenge comes from finding exactly what you need to complete the job at hand which does at times lead to a wild goose chase across the map. There is no puzzles that require timing or can be messed up so with enough patience any obstacle can be overcome even for people terrible at this genre such as I. When all is said and done Dropsy doesn't have anything terribly unique on the gameplay front but it's weird and stylish presentation certainly draws it out from the crowd. So if you ever wanted to play as a clown straight out of a horror movie going around hugging children, animals and an angry man in a chicken costume, I can think of no better game.", "timestamp_created": 1461348164, "timestamp_updated": 1461348164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510585", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22563602": {"recommendationid": "22563602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098353911", "num_games_owned": 3145, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461310296}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u5c5e\u4e8e\u9f20\u6807\u70b9\u51fb\u5192\u9669\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u5168\u7a0b\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u5b57\u5e55\uff0c\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5c31\u662f\u4e92\u52a8\u4e4b\u95f4\u5404\u79cd\u52a8\u753b\u6307\u793a\u3002\u89e3\u5bc6\u867d\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u601d\uff0c\u5168\u6210\u5c31\u7684\u8bdd\u4e5f\u4e0d\u96be\uff0c\u6700\u5f00\u59cb\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5c31\u628a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u91cc\u9762\u7684\u5c0f\u4e11\u978b\u5b50\u70b9\u4e0a\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6210\u5c31\u4f1a\u8f7b\u677e\u4e9b\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1461313790, "timestamp_updated": 1461313790, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607143", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22557627": {"recommendationid": "22557627", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965771164", "num_games_owned": 406, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461210934}, "language": "english", "review": "The often strange tale of a horribly misshapen clown, a friend of animals, who loves everyone, yet is hated by the world in which he lives.

The story follows Dropsy, obese depressed clown who is hated by all people around. He can rely only on his irksome father, and his dog, that is his partner from the beginning.\n\nThe game plays on an island that might feel huge for most players - you might have got used to splitting adventure games into acts that plays on different locations, but Dropsy does it differently. From the beginning of the game, whole island (many scenes!) is available to you to wander through. \n\nThis fact also comes with obvious consequence - the difficulty gets a bit higher in comparison to other current adventure games. There'll be parts where you get stuck but it's up to you then if you'll try to solve everything with peace in mind, or check a walkthrough - there's a great Steam walkthrough made by Morrinn. \n\nLet's make a small rollercoaster of impressions, there's actually one thing that makes the game easier from the others - you can't combine items in your inventory! But on the other hand, you won't be controlling only Dropsy the clown. You will be switching between Dropsy, his dog and later also between his new friends - [spoiler]mouse and a bird[/spoiler].\n\nWhole presentation of the game shows big emphasis of adventure gamers' nostalgia. It's not just about pixelart graphics (which are awesome) but also about the small details like the slow animation for checking the inventory. It's annoying, especially when you're stuck and trying to find out what to do, but nostalgic.\n\nThe game plays a lot on your emotions, as you'll have to feel a lot of hatred from all people around, which you can fix by hugging everybody... or not. They might reject you, which makes you feel even worse. A big mention also deserves the soundtrack of the game, because it's brilliant. There are many great sad and happy tones that you'll love.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nEven though Dropsy is shorter than average point and click adventure game (~3 hours to finish the game, though if you'll be getting stuck, expect more), it's a great adventure experience that's worth recommending, for its speechless story (all dialogues are driven by pictures) and for the atmosphere that brings great impression.", "timestamp_created": 1455106812, "timestamp_updated": 1466837570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685042", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21067012": {"recommendationid": "21067012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042722153", "num_games_owned": 333, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454985880}, "language": "english", "review": "If I had to sum up Dropsy, I'd say this: bizarrely charming.

In a run down town that saw it\u2019s prime a long time ago you will sleep with the homeless in p*ss stinking back alleys and let yourself be exploited by big pharma to get to your hugs. And on the way you will meet characters with a humanity not often seen in gaming.\n\nFrom the priest trading sandwiches for lectures on religious dogma and the lonely unemployed stoner to the megalomaniac junkyard owner and the dropout recluse - they all want something in their lives that they can\u2019t seem to find on their own. \nThat\u2019s where the titular Dropsy comes in, like a child unable to grasp the terrors around him he just want everyone to be happy, and in helping him the player gets to experience these little diamonds of everyday happiness in return. \n\nIn the end it\u2019s a tale of finding beauty and friendship in a hopelessly dark world, and that is what makes Dropsy such a great experience.\n\nHighly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1454964591, "timestamp_updated": 1454974817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21053521": {"recommendationid": "21053521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007401607", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454935764}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful charming point and click adventure game in which you have to figure out what the plot is.", "timestamp_created": 1454944138, "timestamp_updated": 1454944138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21046624": {"recommendationid": "21046624", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003970062", "num_games_owned": 1154, "num_reviews": 212, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454917291}, "language": "english", "review": "An hour into this game, I'm left wondering: why does this game have a metacritic score of 80?\n\nI spent an hour wandering around and solved a few puzzles, but frankly, there has been absolutely nothing whatsoever to love about this game.

Many popular titles in the genre have super obscure solutions to vague/difficult puzzles where you may be forced to consult a guide.

Seriously, I can't remember the last one I played where I didn't hurt in some way at the very least one (usually innocent) NPC. Over time being mean to other characters has become a staple of the genere. Even if this is rather usual in other kind of games, it feels very different when done in point and clikc adventures. More concious, more meditated, with a far clearer mischievous intent. And I love it :-P\n\nDropsy isn't really different to similiar games in that sens, though it definitely does feel different. The main character has an aura of innocence about him. All his actions are clearly aimed to ultimatley helping his neighbors, even though they openly despise him. It is very unsual to find games where the main objective is making everyone happy. And I truly appericate this.\n\nDropsy the clown isn't alone in his adventures. As his jorney progresses, a trio of additional playable characters joins his party: a dog, a mouse and a bird. Each of these are different sizes and have different movement possibilities. These differences are cleverly exploited to block acces to specific areas or objects until the needed friend has joined the party. It may be not immediately obvious how these additional characters are supposed to be used. They lack inventory and all their puzzles are very physical, usually consisting in finding the path to a specific position.\n\nI find laudable the effort that was put into telling the whole story without resorting to text or voices. Unfortunatley the meaning of some of the icons used during dialogs is not always clear. Speaking of which, keep in mind there is text in the game though it just contains additional details which aren't really important to understand the story. These texts are in english but written in a custom alphabet instead of the latin one, so they must be deciphered by the player.\n\nThese game is rather non-linear. In fact, many of it's quests are optional. This is great, though sometimes it may be a bit disorienting. It's not always obvious whether helping one of the neightbours leads to a dead end or has further reaching consequences.\n\nArtistically the game is great. Backgrounds and characters and detailed and full of personality. The animations are also great, very lively and charming. The music is excelent too and very varied. It's also integrated into the gameplay since there are a handful of additional pieces that can be optinally collected through your journey. The SFX are fine, though not very impresive.\n\nAll in all, and although I felt disapointed by the ending, I enjoyed playing Dropsy.

The game\u2019s puzzles and game world environment are all extremely interesting to explore and solve. Following the trend of classic point and clicks, some of the puzzles make no sense what so ever and you will be resorting to the help of forums and wiki posts to progress without wanting to spoil too much of the surprise. Dropsy the clown only wants to help people, as you wander around the modern day world solving small puzzles for anyone you come across, all you want in return is a simple hug. It has a very creepy vibe throughout the whole game that is portrayed excellently through the main character, Dropsy.  Very early on in the game you assemble a party of three other characters, these are a dog, a bird and a mouse. These other party members can be used to complete puzzles, find more items and explore parts of the environment that Dropsy would not otherwise be able to do himself. \n\nThe art style in Dropsy is gorgeous. The pixel art style that takes you back to yesteryear showing off exactly how you pull of the pixel graphics to a very high standard. The game\u2019s animation of all the character is splendid too, with not one wrong move being seen throughout. You will also be very creeped out by a lot of the art in the game too; some of it is very trippy, a lot of it has a really dark feel to it whilst being in a very colourful scheme, but this fits very well with the main character being a Clown though. The art is definitely my favourite aspect of this game. \n\nEven though the game does not have any spoken English dialogue, you are still able to get a grasp of the game\u2019s plot. It has some very sad and tragic undertones, whilst also being bright and cheerful at points too. Most of the game\u2019s story is portrayed with the use of thought bubbles above character\u2019s head. I thought this was a very interesting way of getting the plot across to the player as it leaves a lot of it up to the player\u2019s imagination as well. \n\nDropsy was a very difficult game to complete; I think if I didn\u2019t have the aid of a walkthrough at times I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to complete it. Some of the puzzles and solutions are just fundamentally whacky and I really don\u2019t see how anyone could solve them without some sort of prior knowledge of the game. Throughout the game, you will also have the opportunity to collect lots of collectable items as well, this adds to the game\u2019s longevity and offers a little diversion from the main plot when you need a bit of a break. \n\nI finished Dropsy in just under six hours; this was with completing the majority of the side puzzles for the citizens of the town on top of collecting the other items as well. The game is split into 5 chapters as sort, the first four chapters take about an hour each to complete, whereas the last chapter is more or less just one long cut scene with very little interaction being needed at all. There isn\u2019t any real replay ability in the title as the ending will be the same whatever, but there has been points which you can change the reaction of some of the characters in the latter stage of the game, depending on how you treated them on your play through \u2013 whilst this may not be a massive change on the game, it may add a little replay ability for fans of the point and click genre. \n\nI didn\u2019t have any technical problems during my play through, there isn\u2019t a tutorial in the game, but if you have some knowledge of point and click games, you will be able to work it out very quickly as the inventory and controls are all the same. \n\nDropsy is one of the better point and click games I have played in recent memory, with a very exciting but sad story on top of some beautiful graphics and art style. The game\u2019s low price of \u00a36, 99 should be considered a bargain given the production values on show here. I cannot recommend this top notch indie title enough. \n\n[b][u] Tom's Score Card[/u][/b]\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n[b][u]5) Highly recommended[/u][/b]\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

One thing that differentiates this game from most other point & click games is the icon based dialogues. However, that means that dialogues become just a few icons, such that I could not sympathize with the main character at all. There are a lot of optional quests that grant no other benefit than a hug. The day/night mechanics make it easier to accidentally avoid some important bit, and harder for you for almost no reason. One example would be the costume shop clerk that visits the cemetary at night. There is no obvious hint that would happen, and this example can really block the main story.\nGraphics are OK for most part, but the inventory is awful. With no text to help identify objects, you are left with your imagination. One clear example of this difficult to identify items is a necklace that looks like some sort of hammer from a distance.\nMusic sounds good - although a lot sounds like elevator music to me. However, use of music might be inappropiate at times. It clearly does not react to whatever is happening on screen. The music is varied, maybe too varied.\nAs far as the story goes, it is not really coherent to me. Main character is acting in good faith most of the time, except for when it needs something from S-Corp. You know how most of the time, Point & Click games show that the main character is a cleptomaniac, taking everything that is not bolted down. However, Dropsy usually acts in goodwill, except for a break into S-Corp in order to steal secret thing guarded by two killer robots.\nFor the reasons cited earlier, I cannot recommend the game to anybody else I know.

It's an odd mix of sometimes conflicting themes with a very real world for the player to connect with. \n\nIt has done something to me that a game hasn't done in a long time: I actually CARE about the troubles of an NPC. I can't remember a game where an NPC wasn't just a store, or a worshiper, or a quest giver, or someone that just spouts flavour text. Dropsy present these pixelated characters as 'sad', 'troubled', 'jaded', 'angry', and so on. Due to a combination of minimalistic sound design with excellent pixel art and animation, these feelings are presented as very real. Combine that with the main character, a bundle of misunderstood sweetness, and you have the recipie for a beautiful \"feels\" fest.\n\nAs a game though, it's not what I would call 'fun'. Due to the scope of the world, it was difficult for me to figure out how to solve certain puzzles because some items were faaaaaar away from the NPC that needed it. Simply because there are so many NPCs with a vauge idea how to progress (especially when starting out), this can be a bit frustrating at times. If the game was restricted in certain areas with new locations opening up as the player progressed, solving NPC problems would have felt a lot more managable.\n\nAs an experience, it's incredible. The story is presented to you with pictures, symbols, sound effects and music. That's it. Everything you experience is based on how you perceive these elements. If adventure games aren't your thing, I'd recommend looking up a guide just to complete the game.

The handling of those serious topics is also rather serious.\n\n- Will the setting is novel and fun, the gameplay is absolutely boring - this is a point and click adventures and those can be tremendous fun! (Like deponia or monkey island!) - but where Deponia and Monkey island embed their riddles in their storyline so that figuring out one riddle after another feels like progress and fun, Dropsy takes another approach. You have to convince every npc that you are good and collect hugs after they're convinced. That's the whole story. In a sense, this gameplay feels like a typical questgrinder from an MMORPG - you run around to find the items that match what the npc needs, give it to them and move on to the next search-quest. Gameplaywise, figuring out these \"Riddles\" feels tedious because you know after you have done one, the story won't really progress - all that waits for you are 20 other search quests.\n\n- Characters don't develop any depth. The developers tried their best to develop characters without the use of language (there is no text-speech or voice-speech, people speak with pictures in their speech bubbles) and while the concept is interesting, it ultimately falls short on developing a rich story or characters. Characters you meet feel completely exchangeable (in comparison,  think of monkey island where characters like the pirate captains, captain le Chuck, the three headed monkey, Elaine, your own pirate men etc. brought so much fun to the experience) - in Dropsy, none of the characters (except for your dog companion) is memorable or interesting or entertaining at all.\n\n- The story is poor. There is not much of progression, but you basically need to do 50 fetch/search quests and that's it.\n\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone unless it's on sale for under 2.00$. It's a bit of a disappointment really. the dropsy trailer was great and I hoped I could support a point and click indie developer but there are far better point and click games out there.

And yet, when one tragedy occurs, it's this innocent, lovable creature that takes all the blame. You'll spend the game helping citizens to reclaim your good name. But the overarching plot gets crazier than that. Just play it and find out.\n\nMechanics include an inventory system (with pictograms instead of text, puzzle-solving becomes less obtuse), three helper-critters to get to hard-to-reach places Dropsy could never get to, a world map with ease-of-access quick travel (after playing to about the 1 hour mark), and lots and lots of hugging.\n\nMusic by Chris Schlarb, he of \"Psychic Temple\" fame.

The story may not seem like much at first, but you're definitely in for a ride as you discover the secrets of this town. Graphics and colours are pleasing to the eye and the game runs smoothly. Overall I recommend this game for adventure game fans, and even people that don't play this genre a lot will enjoy it!\n\n[h1]Brief overview, story-wise:[/h1]\nDropsy the clown lives with his father in a small town. He's a caring and loving clown, but a tragedy happened in the past that led to the townspeople shunning him. Dropsy starts off helping some wildlife and inhabitants of the town, but he has to get them to trust him again first! This is the basis of the \"quests\", you help people in need, after you convince them to let you help! I really enjoyed this type of quest because it felt meaningful and at the end you get hugs! The graphics and sounds for the hugs and other actions are really nice too in this game.\n\nAs for a deeper overarching story - I promise you there is one, and not just the hug/ helping quests. However from my experience the best way is to just play it without knowing anything, and I can't really cover it without giving anything away. \n\n[h1]Thoughts, game play wise:[/h1]\nDropsy plays as a standard adventure game, however there are some differences from a typical game of this sort. Firstly there isn't a large inventory, and the interface is relatively simple. Secondly there's no reading - everything's done through visual and audio cues, which I really enjoyed, it allowed me to interpret things my own while being fully immersed in the experience. Also, there's minimal \"pixel hunting\" which is sometimes a problem in other similar games. During my play through, I didn't run into crashes or bad bugs at all and the game's performance is very smooth.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nI'm happy to say that Dropsy exceeded my expectations - I was expecting a really simple story and typical game play.

Whether you will like it or not depends heavily on your tolerance for weirdness.  The videos and screenshots give you a good idea what you're in for.\n\n\nThe Good:\n\nIt's unique.  There is minimal violence, and almost all of it is directed toward the player character.  It is very psychedelic, and disturbing in places despite the relative lack of violence.\n\nDespite how bizarre the setting is, the solutions to the puzzles all made sense, and seemed fair.\n\nWhile mute player characters are a common defect in game design, it is intentional here.  Dropsy also cannot read well.  Coping with this is part of the puzzle solving.  I haven't seen that done before.\n\nEven though Dropsy can't read most of it, all text in the game [i]is[/i] meaningful, and you can find translations online.  You may get more out of the plot by reading the translations after completing the game.\n\nThe ending is satisfying.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThere are no volume controls.  It really needs them since it is pretty loud by default.\n\nThe music won't appeal to everyone.  It's not all like the videos.  I'm not sure what the genres are, but some of it is very distorted and noisy.\n\nIt's easy to get \u2018stuck\u2019.  I can't fault the game for this, but it is a problem nonetheless.

As a metaphor of the climate of hate and incomprehension in a post-9/11 world. Serving as an acid critic to the globalization and the current U.S. policies. But also as a love letter to two of the greatest American cultural contributions in the form of classical Hollywood cinema and Jazz music[/h1]\n\nThe world completely changed after the terrorist attacks occurred on 11 September 2001 in New York. Leading us to an increased militarization in the western countries, now obsessed with the idea of security. So consequently, the artistic and cultural manifestations also changed, including videogames. A generation which grew up with cute videogame mascots was followed by a new generation of children playing realistic war simulators. While they saw tragic news on television, talking about the devastating consequences of the Irak War. It\u2019s not a coincidence that in a country like the United States, where so many young lives were lost in the Irak War, [i]Call of Duty[/i] became the best-selling franchise. In the New World Order raised from the ashes of the 9/11, the war was seen as an everyday routine.\n\nI also think that it\u2019s not a coincidence that a game like [i]Dropsy[/i] was launched in the same weekend of September 11. Given that it\u2019s a work surrounded with a pacifist message, talking about the act of giving our unselfish love to others as the only  possible means to make the world a better place, mitigating the intolerance by trying to not prejudge other people. It\u2019s easy to see in the cheerful and lovable clown Dropsy a mirror of all the Muslim people resident in western countries that were judged as potential terrorists in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11.\n\nWith a lot of its contemporary games relying in the idea of violence as the only possible means to defend our countries and using an ever increasing level of realism, in [i]Dropsy[/i] we have our hugs as the main tool for interacting with other characters, trying to bring happiness to other people\u2019s lives. And it departs from realism, sculpting an intentionally surreal world with some dreamy landscapes reflecting Dropsy\u2019s traumas that seem taken from a Dali\u2019s painting mixed with LSD.\n\n[i]Dropsy[/i] is clearly inspired by Yoshirou Kimura\u2019s [i]Chulip[/i], one of the all-time best adventure games. Prior to the creation of [i]Chulip[/i], Yoshirou Kimura was one of the co-founders of Love-de-Lic, a Japanese studio that was responsible for some of the most creative games in videogame history. With [i]Chulip[/i] being the consummation of Yoshirou Kimura\u2019s principles regarding art creation.\n\n[i]Chulip[/i], like [i]Dropsy[/i], was a game based in the idea of help other people with the final objective of give a kiss to every single character. So like in [i]Dropsy[/i], all of its puzzles were centered in how to win the confidence of the city inhabitants until we may be able to kiss them.\n\nThe subtle difference between [i]Dropsy[/i] and [i]Chulip[/i] comes in the form of its ambience and artistic and intellectual references. [i]Chulip[/i] was envolved with a tinge of sadness and melancholy, highlighted by a palette with a tendency to ocre and brown tonalities. Its universe was so quirk as the showed in Dropsy, but another type of quirkiness. With cute characters more close to the perverted habitants that you could find in Austin Jorgensen\u2019s [i]Lisa[/i]. An the use of narrative in [i]Chulip[/i] evokes the cruel society found in Charles Dickens\u2019 novels, with a component of social criticism resembling Akira Kurosawa\u2019s films such as [i]Dodes\u2019ka-den[/i] or [i]The Lower Depths[/i].\n\n[i]Dropsy[/i] is more like the luminous and warm opposite to [i]Chulip[/i]. Its colorful palette takes its inspiration from Tim Schafer\u2019s classic adventures in the vein of [i]Day of the Tentacle[/i], suggesting 60\u2019s cartoons. At a first glance, some of its characters may seem a little disturbing. But all of them hide in his interior a kindness and friendly part waiting to be discovered. [i]Dropsy[/i], like [i]Undertale[/i], is a perfect antidote against all the skepticism surrounding the 21st century. A warm damp hug given to neutralize the nihilism.\n\nIf in [i]Chulip[/i] the Akira Kurosawa\u2019s social films were an obvious inspiration, [i]Dropsy[/i] looks directly to Charles Chaplin\u2019s first silent movies. Showing the same wise combination between tenderness and dramatic elements. Like Charles Chaplin or Takeshi Kitano in some of his first movies, [i]Dropsy[/i]\u2019s creator Jay Tholen has the magical ability of generating vivid emotions in the player, making you pass from crying to laughing. But most importantly, Jay Tholen shows the same talent as Charles Chaplin in the creation of a mise-en-sc\u00e8ne. By disposing visual elements with a narrative focus in every shot. By evoking a lively environment through the interaction of these visual elements. And by providing accented expressions to his characters. With a narrative constructed only through the use of images, [i]Dropsy[/i] becomes a love letter to classic silent movies. Resulting in a touching experience that it will be able to draw an immense smile on your face.\n\n[i]Dropsy[/i] also serves as an acid social critic to the globalization. And like Charles Chaplin\u2019s films, it introduces subliminal messages for the construction of a more equitable world, eradicating any type of intolerance. In one of its more emotive fragments, we can see a woman in a church predicating against minority groups. Outside of the church, in an adjacent street, we can see an elderly woman begging for food. When Dropsy gives a sandwich to her and after and emotive hug, she will retire to an isolated corner with a crucifix to praise the Lord. Showing the true meaning of christianity as a religion about giving our love to others, trying to not discriminate those people with personal beliefs that are different from ours.\n\nLike [i]Hylics[/i], another videogame masterpiece created by Mason Lindroth and also a sole-man effort, [i]Dropsy[/i] shows an extreme level of detail in its animations and backgrounds, with thousands of small and subtle details. An ambition emphasized by its open world structure, with a cycle of day and night altering the interactions with other characters. In both creations, [i]Dropsy[/i] and [i]Hylics[/i], is easy to perceive the seminal influence of Bill Plympton, one of the greatest American independent animators.\n\nAnd its soundtrack composed by Chris Schlarb envelops its world with a groovy Jazz feeling, that serves to sculpt an idealized postcard of the American culture.\n\n[i]Dropsy[/i] is one of the best indie adventure games ever created. And an emotive art piece that equals other instant classics such as [i]Kentucky Route Zero[/i], [i]Why Am I Dead at Sea[/i], [i]Botanicula[/i], [i]Gemini Rue[/i] or [i]The Last Door[/i].\n\n\n[i]( The writer of this review is not an English native.

Well, such a creature does exist. His name is Dropsy.\n\nDropsy is the story of a simple clown, living a simple life, with his beloved parents in a simple circus. But that all changes when one night, a fire breaks out, taking the circus and Dropsy's beloved mom with it. For whatever reason, Dropsy is blamed for starting the fire; soon after, his beloved father suddenly falls ill.\n\nAlso, the poor guy is bald, overweight, illiterate, and gap-toothed to boot.\n\nBy all accounts, Dropsy looks like he should be a deranged lunatic. But the thing is...he's not. Even after suffering all this trauma, all the poor guy wants to do is make friends, help people, and give hugs. Dropsy's a grown man with the innocence of a child, but it somehow doesn't come across as creepy. He's just a good-natured clown who loves other people and animals (like his puppy, mouse, and bird friends), and he just wants to help.\n\nVisually, this game looks a lot like those old point-and-click games, such as \"Monkey Island\" or \"Sam & Max Hit the Road.\" There is one major difference though: this game has no dialogue. At all. The entire story is told through word balloons and pictures; some people might need time to get used to this, but it's not that hard to follow. The soundtrack is pretty good, too; there are a lot of different songs, and they stick with you.\n\nYeah, the story's not a very deep one, and there are plenty of other stories with the \"beauty is only skin-deep\" moral. But at the same time, \"Dropsy\" makes it work.

After all this game embraces \u201cshow, don't tell\u201d by having absolutely zero dialogue or exposition. But as an advocate for the power and utility of words, I should probably give it a shot.\n\nBeing nice is hard. For Dropsy though\u2014the eponymous moist demonic-faced clown\u2014it is simply second nature. He's the last innocent in a jaded world. By some sinister stroke of misfortune however, Dropsy's circus tent has burned down and the blame is pinned on him. Townspeople are quick to turn against him. It's up to Dropsy to prove their reactions wrong by performing good deeds\u2014doing so only because that is simply Dropsy's way.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of Dropsy's gamplay is its nonlinearity. An open world point-and-click adventure? Outrageous!\n\nBy nonlinear I mean that almost the entire map is available to explore from the get-go. This is a questionable tactic for an adventure game, as it is overwhelming for the player to have so much immediately available. There's a reason after all why most adventure games are step-by-step structured\u2014it is easier and more fluid for the player to process the information that way. Overlapping sidequests and mainquests mean a lot of inventory-collecting and information-gathering without a clear idea of how either is to be implemented. The result makes Dropsy suffer from a general lack of direction, the player not receiving much feedback from their actions nor gaining a definite sense of progress. Open world also means traversing the same maps over and over again, which can be repetitive. A day and night cycle makes the exploration even more daunting.\n\nYet the charm and liveliness of the world is undeniable. An eclectic, catchy soundtrack complements the bright, vibrant visuals. The music ranges from hardcore punk to poppy little diddies, the musicians here composing fantastically low-fi representations of popular genres. Meanwhile the pixel art is beautiful, with a variety of unique settings and smooth animations.\n\nThe characters are diverse and endearing. Three little critter buddies accompany you\u2014a bird, a mouse and a dog (whose mission is ostensibly to pee on as many things as he can). Along the way, Dropsy also runs into an angry all-women punk band, a preacher who believes that rock music is the devil, a vampire-fearing cult and the corrupt CEO of a pharmaceutical pastry corporation. To name just a few.\n\nDialogue is shown through visual symbols. For instance, a character complains about work. Instead of simply saying \u201cI hate work,\u201d the character's speech bubble has a little person with a shovel followed by a red circle with a cross through it.\n\nNonverbal communication in an adventure is a phenomenal idea, performed well in the past by Machinarium. The difference here is that Machinarium had a very simple plot. Dropsy meanwhile is ceaselessly complicated. This demands a lot of attention on the part of the player. On its own this isn't asking too much\u2014it only gets increasingly convoluted as we delver further into a plot involving aliens, conspiracy and evil corporations. Things get a little lost in translation.\n\nDropsy also at times refuses to keep the player in the loop of its game world logic. Take, for example, when the player might want to enter the nightclub in town. As an adventure game, would we not want to explore every single possible location? Yet whenever the player tries to make Dropsy enter the club, he simply walks in front of it then shrugs. No clear indication of why he cannot enter is given. Other similar information is often failed to be communicated to the player\u2014instead of explanations, we are often just met with a shrug.\n\nDespite problems with a sense of plot progression and generally just getting lost in the game world, there is an undeniable satisfaction to going around doing nice things for people and getting hugs. It is one of the purest examples of positive feedback in gaming\u2014do good things and people will like you more, will want to support and assist you. Dropsy's rather horrifying appearance is ignored in lieu of his benevolent actions. It is heartwarming to see, both funny and touching.\n\nWhile Dropsy isn't quite as fun as it could have been, it does have its moments. Some puzzles, such as a sequence in which you must break into a building as a mouse, are quite challenging and clever. The world it builds is inimitable. It just doesn't flow as smoothly as it might\u2014the player finds the narrative moving in jumps and starts, progressing almost accidentally as they stumble upon new information, collect a new item or else discover a new location. This can be frustrating to experience, make the game more tedious than need be.\n\nAs a whole, though, there is nothing else like Dropsy out there. It has its shortcomings, but it is a one-of-a-kind, lovable, huggable experience. For that alone it is worth playing.\n\nA copy of the game was provided by the developer for review on PC.", "timestamp_created": 1445696879, "timestamp_updated": 1445696879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18650772": {"recommendationid": "18650772", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963519093", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448149691}, "language": "english", "review": "unique and beautiful", "timestamp_created": 1445659378, "timestamp_updated": 1445659378, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458477", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18634459": {"recommendationid": "18634459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026312785", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445574716}, "language": "english", "review": "What a great experience, I love P&C games and this is a great one!\nPlayed it at a friends house and bought it as soon as I was home.\nRelaxing atmosphere, interesting plot and storytelling that stands on it's own without the use of textheavy dialogue (just small pictures to guide you through the story), very colorful artwork and the puzzles are just challenging enough to not be frustrating.\nThe games plot fascinated me enough to play it several times (even though I pretty much found everything on my first run) and even decrypted it's own alphabet by myself, just to get some more little titbits out of it (I'm almost able to read it without my notes on my ongoing third playthrough).\n\nI definitely recommend it for a chill evening. \nI would say it will take somewhere between 2-5 hours depending on your experience with P&Cs (or if you are like me: 1-2 extra hours of decrypting the simlish they used for text and trying to put some of the more abstract clues together).\n", "timestamp_created": 1445576358, "timestamp_updated": 1445576358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18633964": {"recommendationid": "18633964", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995600718", "num_games_owned": 932, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448829246}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved this game.

It's not a strict \"I need to complete these 3 objectives to get in there\" kind of adventure. If you are the kind of person who likes to explore and \"live in\" an odd and original world, you will find lots to love in Dropsy.\n\nBonus: the art and music are fantastic. And while the \"no text\" setup seems annoying at first, deciphering the pictogram nature of the dialog balloons becomes half the fun. It lets you peer into the way Dropsy sees the things around him.", "timestamp_created": 1444777717, "timestamp_updated": 1444777717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18457606": {"recommendationid": "18457606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150243196", "num_games_owned": 381, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444673993}, "language": "english", "review": "Disclaimer: Review key provided by developer.\n\nFull review available at [url=http://wordsaboutgames.net/2015/10/13/dropsy-review/]Words About Games[/url]\n\n[h1][u]TL;DR[/u][/h1]\nDropsy is an open world, point-and-click \u201chugventure\u201d game in which you play as the eponymous Dropsy \u2013 a bulbous, grotesque clown who just wants to make the world a better place. Suspected as the cause of a circus fire some five years previous which claimed the life of Dropsy\u2019s mother, your goal is to turn the hatred the town feel towards you into love. By hugging them. And animals. And trees. And inanimate objects. Your inventory is in the crotch region of your bouncy clown pants.\n\nOverall, I found Dropsy to be a great experience. Although the difficulty is at times rage-quittingly tremendous, this is counteracted by the wonderful and vibrant world you\u2019re introduced to. Thankfully, none of the frustration is technical \u2013 the game runs like clockwork. The characters all feel human in their desires and flaws, and I cannot express just how effective this game is graphically. The story elicits so much bewildering, tragic joy for a game featuring no words. I\u2019d recommend it to any point and click aficionado, although \u2013 and I mean this in the best possible way \u2013 it is definitely not one for the casual gamer.\n", "timestamp_created":

I would highly recommend this colorful hugventure to anyone who is a fan of the genre.\n\nAt a frist glance this game may look quite strange with an even stranger protagonist, but over time Dropsy the clown will grow on you, and you'll find that despite his looks he's just a lovable person that wants nothing more but to help. The more I played, the more I found a place in my heart for the misunderstood clown. It's the kind of game that really teaches that looks can be deceiving, and really follows an overall theme of acceptence of others no matter what walk of life they come from, as Dropsy wanders about trying to hug as many people as possible.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes I found the puzzles to be challenging, but not so much that I couldn't figure out what I was doing after wandering around for a little while. I got stuck a few times, but I still managed to figure things out myself with out having to refer to a guide. Other puzzles can be fairly straight forward, and a good amount are side quests that end with a hug. Even though the side quests aren't nessicary I still felt compelled to hug as many people as I possibly could. There's something so warm and fuzzy about it that I just adore!\n\nThe graphics are wonderful to look at, pixilated, bright, and colorful. I really dig the art style, and although it can be very cherry, it can also be just as creepy and brooding when it needs to be. There is some creepy/disturbing imagery in this game so if you're a fan of spooky scary things you'll love this, and if you're not don't worry the game mainly focuses on the bright and cheery as opposed to the morbid. I for one adore it, but I do love me some horror.\n\nI don't want to talk to much about the story, but the basic premise is that a during a circus preformence a fire was started burning the big top down and claiming a few lives. The media suspects Dropsy might have been the cause and most of the town hates him as a result. You do what you can to help others, while unveiling mysteries along the way. From happy, to tragic. There's also no text for this game, all of the dialog is done through symbols and pictures that appear in word bubbles. I was able to easily understand all of it, and only had a few that made me scratch my head. It's conveyed very nicely. Anyway that's all I want to say on that I don't want to spoil a lot, you really should experience it for yourself.\n\nLast and certainly not least, in my opinion, the music of this game is supurb! I'm literally about to buy the soundtrack right now as soon as I'm finished writing this review. It adds to the overall atmosphere to the game, and I found myself getting lost in it while playing. It can be calm and relaxing, unnerving and uncomfortable, uplifting and at the same time meloncholy. I'm not music expert so take this with a grain of salt, but I believe the genre is sort of Jazzy? There's also piano, guiter, and forms of electronic music. I suggest playing with headphones.\n\nThat's about all I have to say. I'll just continue to hammer it in, if you're a fan of point and click adventures, seriously, PICK THIS UP! You won't regret it. If you haven't played point and click adventure games in the past, and you're looking to try something new, I would still reccommend this game.

Es un claro ejemplo de transmitir emociones y sentimientos sin necesidad de palabras.\n\nEl entorno que nos rodea es sencillamente bello. Como algunos juegos en los que ha podido distribuir Devolver Digital, a esta aventura la envuelve un toque retro, protagonizado por pixel graphics, algo muy de moda \u00faltimamente en los juegos de desarrolladoras indie.

Your main activity will be helping - and hugging - all the people around you, gaining their trust and love while making the world a better place. It is by exploration that both story and the pretty big game world unfolds, giving you that great sense of wonder with each new screen you walk into. The surroundings feel fresh and slightly weird, comparable to those of Sam and Max (albeit a bit less over the top I guess.. maybe).\n\nThere are some minor sidequests to be done besides following the main story line. That gives the game some longevity besides the four hours give or take that it would take to complete otherwise, but also I do believe that you'll get different endings according to how much you have done. I only finished it once so far though so I'll have to figure that out myself as well. Steam achievements are not yet working at the time of this writing, but that's about to be fixed very soon so that will be an extra incense to explore thoroughly. \n\nSo yes, give this game a hug and buy it, the fart button alone is totally worth it! 3<", "timestamp_created": 1442784993, "timestamp_updated": 1442786521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502982", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18124154": {"recommendationid": "18124154", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995506775", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442610178}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044b...\u043d\u043e \u0441 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0437\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0447\u0443\u0434\u043e, \u044f \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0443\u044e \u0432\u044f\u0437\u043a\u0443\u044e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0443 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043a \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0443.\n\n\u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438:\n\n-\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434, \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0435 (\u0441\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e, \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u044b \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0438, \u0438 \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0432 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044e!);\n-\u041e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0440 (\u0447\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u043c \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435);\n-\u0421\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u0443\u0442\u043e\u043a: \u0443\u0442\u0440\u043e,\u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c,\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440,\u043d\u043e\u0447\u044c (\u0442\u0430 \u0436\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f);\n-\u041c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043d\u044b (\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e 4 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439);\n-\u0412 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0432, \u0432\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e \u0438 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0443\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e.\n", "timestamp_created": 1442784107, "timestamp_updated": 1442784107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18123950": {"recommendationid": "18123950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081610272", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448559728}, "language": "brazilian", "review": " It was worth every penny, the story is so beautiful and different... ;-;\n I don't like clowns, but this one is absolutely lovely.

Whereas other publishers would see a point and click adventure game about a functionally illiterate clown man who only wants to be loved and run the fuck in the other direction, Devolver Digital charges headfirst towards it, eager and willing to be the recipient of terrifying damp clown hugs. Even if, so far, the reaction to Dropsy has been a little less than lukewarm.\n\nDropsy is one of the weirdest goddamn games I've ever played. It plays a lot like an old school SCUMM-VM title with all the modern user interface conveniences thrown in, and that's a big fucking plus - you can look the part with the beautiful '90s era pixel-art scenery, but you don't have to go all in and start forcing players to play with a verb bar that takes up 35% of the screen. A lot of the fat has been cut out and it allowed me to focus on what mattered - figuring out what the fuck to do with half of my inventory to EARN THOSE WARM DAMP HUGS.\n\nEarning those damp hugs, though, is not entirely easy, and it's partially due to the fact that the game is centered around a character who is functionally illiterate. And that's a big plus - in order to figure out what I had to do next, I had to disabuse myself of my inclination to focus on the language and pick up on the details surrounding the game. It alienated and made me feel like a tourist! But even then, a lot of the time I was wandering around, trying to figure out what to do next while feeling really stupid, like I did with classic point-and-click adventures. Some of it was due to my own incompetence, but I feel I can pin some blame on the game's idiosyncracies. The daytime/nighttime system feels like an inconvenience and I felt it could have been left out without sacrificing too much of the dynamic feel of the world.

(Oddly enough, one of the interaction icons is a hand.) So Dropsy must travel through the town and countryside, restoring his good name as he gives hugs to any and all, resolving their many issues along the way. But Dropsy is not alone, travelling with his (dog with a snout? pig?) who pees where he goes, gaining the same rewards as Dropsy's hugs.\n\nThe player can control either Dropsy or his pet at any moment. There is little prelim info offered, but additional options are hugs (people, squirrels, trees rocks, you name it), inventory (as he reaches down into his pants) and settings/saves. There are two others I have yet to obtain. This is a land of mostly unhappy people, with sadness of their own. The sad people have no time or use for Dropsy, so Dropsy must solve their problems as best he can, in order to give them his trademark hugs.\n\nThe problem is that there are no words or speech in this land; all is told in pictures. Even sentences (of a sort) are related in little pictures, so the intent is usually vague. But mistrust of Dropsy is never vague, and his feeling are crushed often. Yet he never quits, working day and night in an interesting system that tells you where you currently are in a 24-hour clock. Some tasks can only happen during one or the other, and Dropsy must sometimes sleep, even though the result may be horrifying dreams about blood, or his deceased parents.\n\nI'm enjoying Dropsy enough so far as to justify its price. The OST seemed a bit steep at $10US, so I passed. Actually, the music included is more than serviceable, and I'm enjoying it very much.

The graphics style and animation are awesome, and the soundtrack is really good.\n\nHowever a very bad decisions regarding the storytelling and whole gameplay design were made. First of all there are no dialogues, or any other text in the game (the only existing text pieces are written in cypher), so basically you have to figure out the personal stories of each character (and the main story of the game) by interacting with them and solving their quests. In the beginning it seems like an innovative idea, but very quickly you discover that it just making the game story empty, and some quests absolutely pointless. \nFor example there's this costume guy in a wagon - he has this display case with some rings that some alien dropped some time ago, but the rings are decayed already. So you go find that alien, get new rings from him, and bring the new rings to the costume guy again. End of story/quest. Why this guy sits in a wagon all day and shows everyone his rings? What was the point of all this quest? I have no idea, probably a hefty amount of very creative imagination needed from the player to actually enjoy this kind of stuff.\nMore than half of the game is basically pointless quests without a proper writing like that, you find some character - you see what they need in an image box - you bring it to them - you hug each other - end of quest. The fish in the pond, the aircraft crash site guard, the music dude who wants an album, etc, etc...\nAnd then you get to the finale - a rushed, weird, out-of-context, and again without any proper writing, that probably supposed to be left to the player's imagination - but if you won't find through the game an extremely difficult hidden secrets, you won't understand anything (and even with all the secrets it's still hard to figure out what's going on), and the game will leave you with a very bad taste.\n\nStill I have to say that even with all these bad design ideas. I enjoyed the game while I played it, and can't say that I disappointed too much, so in the bottom line I'll recomend it, and hope that the author will make another point-n-click adventure, but this time with a better storytelling.", "timestamp_created": 1442077588, "timestamp_updated": 1442077588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493458", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18000905": {"recommendationid": "18000905", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962377896", "num_games_owned": 756, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465122224}, "language": "german", "review": "kurz gesagt: einfach sch\u00f6n !", "timestamp_created": 1442073443, "timestamp_updated": 1442073443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18000357": {"recommendationid": "18000357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002719790", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442008109}, "language": "english", "review": "If this game was released 10 years ago it would be a work of art.\n\nAnd it still is.", "timestamp_created": 1442071374, "timestamp_updated": 1442071374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17999913": {"recommendationid": "17999913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036197758", "num_games_owned": 2169, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442054917}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh man!\n\nThis game is so awesome that you won't believe your own eyes (and ears - soundtrack is fabulous).\nDon't want to spoil anything so I'll just say - buy this, you won't regret it!\nAnd there is some extra content (additional area) coming in few weeks.\n\nThose two weeks of September have been like Christmas for point and click adventure fans - Stasis and Dropsy have been released.

He's a little scary. I certainly wouldn't want to hug him if he was walking down the street.

The four playable characters (dropsy, his dog, the bird, and the mouse), are all really cool, and interesting companions, each with their own character specific abilities.\n\nSo many of the gameplay mechanics are unique, and surprisingly enough they're implemented in a way that close to perfect. Some specific examples of said mechanics are the interesting non verbal clues the characters give you, as well as the different character, and team specific puzzles available.\n\nThere also is the larger puzzle of decoding the in game letters of the game, Fez did something similar, however unlike Fez figuring out what these specific characters mean is a significanlty easier task. Being able to read the in game languge will help shed light on the in game lore. Which is a fun bonus, and a nice touch.\n\nI like that you can complete so many different side objectives, and that the game allows you to keep track of what you've done via some pictures on the wall of the main characters home, as well as a small map in the dogs room.\n\nNeat little touches like that really show how much thought went into the game, not only from an asthetic standpoint, but also from a design standpoint as well.\n\nThere are some things I wish were handled differently, some items seem to stick around even after you've used them, some items don't get collected properly either. None of these are game breaking issues, and hopefully will get patched.\n\nSome of the puzzles were too easy, and at times literally were repeated (like the bird stealing two wheels). I also feel a newgame plus would have made this game more enjoyable, I doubt everyone is going to beat all the side quests the first time around, and it's kind of arduous needing to get everything all over again.\n\nThe game is also a little short, it would have been nicer to have been able to explore a bit more. On the other hand the artwork and animation are top notch, so it's understandable for a project this detailed to needs to limit itself, otherwise it would still be in development, and people need to eat.  \n\nLastly I like that despite the dark aspects of the game, the underlying themes of teamwork, friendship, and  understanding are all present. It's so rare to have a main character these days who's completely magnanimous, there is something really positive about this game that just makes it a fun, and enjoyable experience.\n\n4/5 I would recommend.\n\nThanks,\n- Celx Requin \nwww.twitter.com/cancercinema\nwww.cancer-cinema.com/badtaste", "timestamp_created": 1442009385, "timestamp_updated": 1442009385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17989076": {"recommendationid": "17989076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035689895", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442206800}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is weird and adorable.  It follows a cartoon clown who has a tragic back story and a love of hugs.  It follows the general adventure game formula of encountering people with problems then helping them fix them.  However, it has some distinctive qualities in gameplay.  First, there is a day night cycle.  Sometime problems can only be solved at certain times of the day, othertimes you will encounter someone in a different situation that might give you a hint about what they want.  Second, the game has no dialogue.  Unlike most adventure games where the protaganist and characters chatter, this game uses only pictograms.  It ends up being very effective and still communicates distinct charatcer traits with just a few images.  Thirdly, the game features animal companions who have access to areas that dropsy doesn't and can help you solve puzzles and complete side quests.  All in all, the puzzles were at worst competent and at best surprising.  It avoids the pitfalls of impossible or incoherent puzzles, but still manages to be challenging enough to satisfy.\n\nThe art and animation are quite brilliant.  Dropsy has no right to be as cute as he is in this game.  It's like the developer challenged himself to make a horror clown cute and succeeeded.  The way he hugs things is adorable and the compasion and diginity the game gives this outcast clown are really special.  It's a pretty memorable art style that mixes psyachdelic art with classical cartooing.\n\nAs a last note, the game may be worth playing for the music alone.  Many game soundtracks seem like workmen efforts.  They effectively hit a tone you need for a point in the game, but don't stand out.  In Dropsy, the music stack in my head.  I found myself listening to casettes (a collectable item with music on it) for no reason other than to hear the music.  I didn't buy the special edition with the soundtrack, but maybe I should have.\n\nThe one drawback I had was that the game hit a bug (after the scene in the shed).  I restarted the game and it worked, but it was a tad bit annyoing.  I noticed a few minor moments that might have benefited from some polishing, but overall the quality of the game as pretty high.\n\nIn the end, I gladly recommend this.

But it feels like Dropsy's actual goal is to make everyone happy and so it is the thing you will do most of the time.\n\nWith that in mind, the whole character of Dropsy is wonderful and I always just wanted to hug everyone. Especially that lil dog that follows you the whole time (One of the cutest game characters I know). The soundtrack is fitting perfectly into it. While it can be very creepy, or sometimes different, it always fits to the cuteness or creepiness of the game. Followed by the wonderful art, that can only be described as the very best pixel art since the old Lucas Arts adventures, this game should be considered not just a game, but pure art.\n\nI will definitely play this again and can already say, that this is one of the best games of the year.

I had fairly high expectations, and they were totally blown away by this game.\n\nI'm not usually a fan of adventure games. Even the easier ones have me lost and confused most of the time, desperately searching for the one small nook or cranny I missed to find the critical item to advance. I won't lie, I had a period of that in Dropsy for a little while, but otherwise this was a very smooth ride compared to my experiences with the rest of the genre.\n\nBut wow, this game. The way it manages to balance out the absolutely grim themes with gushing optimism was more than enough to play my heart strings like a fiddle. It's a very offbeat adventure game where you play as a scary-looking clown named Dropsy who, even in the darkest moments of the story, strives to bring happiness to everyone he meets.\n\nDropsy can hug virtually anyone (and anything, including inanimate objects) in the town, though some cynical citizens are either too miserable to accept it or flat-out don't like Dropsy much. In these cases, you can go through these optional \"hug quests\" to do light adventure game puzzles, in the end bringing joy to the townsfolk and earning a hug in the process. Along the way you also get animal friends who can help with a variety of puzzles.\n\nAnother truly unique aspect of it is that, aside from the title screen, there isn't a single bit of text in the game (at least that's in any human language, all hieroglyphics). All characters talk in sort of picture-book pantomimes, creating this visual language which adds both challenge to the puzzles and a bit of nuance to the storytelling. There are a couple instances where this system can be unfortunately vague, leading to the occasions where I got lost, but outside of that it's a brilliant way to do narrative.\n\nThe only critiques I could really come up with is that the wonderfully mellow soundtrack is desperately crying out for better transitions between screens, and that the ending is a huge trip which might be divisive for some.

Dropsy the Misinterpreted clown is on a point and click adventure with his dog to find happiness and answers, with beautiful art (thanks to the use of psychedelic drugs I'd pressume) and the funkiest of soundtracks I've heard in a long time this game was fun around every corner, To the whacked out dreams and bangin' cassette beats. Being unable to hug anyone around you to start with is beyond upsetting (being able to take a poop in multiple areas of the game eased that upset feeling) I gotta say, but you soon befriend a squirrel and get your first hug of many.\n\nAfter fixing problems for people around the town, like giving a chicken some twinkies, to helping a little girl by planting a rose for her (while she's sleeping) in place of her dead rose, all the way over to a homeless homieless granny getting a sandwich after it was rescued from the local church with heavy metal, the town soon comes to like you and give you the hugs wherever you go.\n\nDue to this games point and click nature you'd assume there's not all that much to do, but for every new place you come across you have 5-10 new options of learning and seeing new and cool things. The added feature of a day and night cycle will have you going back to previous areas to re-explore. Dropsy is so great you can even hug a government operations agent all you like which felt pretty nice, Dropsy was super happy and that made me super happy.\n\nDropsy is beyond misinterpreted and I believe you all need to have a purchase, and a play of this wonderful game. If you would like a further look at the game I've created a short video that shows a large expanse of the Dropsy universe, to the fun and happy, to the sad and miserable, come one come all and join dropsy and I in an adventure: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsZZXDAGldI&feature=youtu.be", "timestamp_created": 1441925560, "timestamp_updated": 1441925560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532534", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17975479": {"recommendationid": "17975479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034154659", "num_games_owned": 1731, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504116174}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Are you feeling Blue today?

Really a lot.\nIn fact it might even require a Therapist but oh well.\nWhile it does take a darker route here and there this is truly a lovely game. All about hugging and making people feel good.\n\nOh and on another note: There\u2019s no text. Nothing. Nada. So in case you\u2019re afraid of reading, since this is what you usually do in a classic point and click adventure (and of course pointing and clicking \u2026 Duh), fear not!\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nFrom the looks of it (since there\u2019s no text remember?), [i]Dropsy[/i], the ugly but loveably Clown, becomes an Outcast after a fire burns down his Family\u2019s Circus and he\u2019s now on his Quest, with his trusty Sidekick [i]Dog[/i], to uncover the truth in order to clear his name.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nYou point. Then you click.\nMoving on!\nJust kidding. Well alright yes you do point and click in order to move or interact with objects, animals or people but that\u2019s not only it. First and foremost. No one likes you. Let that sink in for a second. That\u2019s a terrible feeling isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s exactly why you have to make everyone like you again so you can hug them and become friends. Might as well tell you folks that you can literally hug everything. You can even hug a tree and become a tree hugger! How cool is that!?\nThere are also a bunch of puzzles you have to do in order to do so. But not only that. The game features actual [i]Time[/i]. By that I mean there\u2019s some stuff only happening at Night, be it specific People showing up or else and some only show up when the sun\u2019s shining bright.\nRemember the part about this game not having any text? Yup you have only images that give you some clues.\nSo that might be confusing and even a bit frustrating at first but you\u2019ll get the hang of it pretty quick.\nI guarantee it.\nOh and it\u2019s an open world game. Sorta. Well you can decide for yourself on how you want to tackle this game and what you do want to do without anyone holding your hand or following a linear story.\n\n[h1]Visual[/h1]\nIf you\u2019ve read any of my other Reviews before then you might know that I absolutely love Pixel games. I just adore the art style. There\u2019s just so much detail in this game it\u2019s unbelievable. Not only that but also the amount of color that has been used \u2026 Just gorgeous.\nIt really looks like it\u2019s alive and breathing.\nAbsolutely stunning. Every character looks unique and was created with so much love and details it\u2019s really fantastic.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe Music is stunning. Brilliant. And so, oh so fitting! It\u2019s creepy where it has to be creepy, uplifting where it has to be uplifting and overall just perfect. I mean remember \u2026 no text. So the music in this game is key for atmosphere and just the general gameplay.\nI have to give a shout out to the Artist right here.\nThe game features over 50 minutes of live music composed and performed by [url=http://schlarb.bandcamp.com/]Chris Schlarb[/url].\nI\u2019ve stumbled upon him some time ago, actually ages and just enjoy listening to his music every now and then.\n\n[h1]What else can I say?[/h1]\nNot much. Or maybe too much.\nIt\u2019s a game for everyone. I really mean it despite it being creepy here and there but you can let your Kid play this game or just enjoy it yourself.\nI stumbled upon this game by chance and after watching the trailer [i]and[/i] seeing it\u2019s been published by [i]Devolver[/i] \u2026 well I was sold and I don\u2019t regret my decision to buy this game at all.\nIt\u2019s truly something else especially in the point and click genre.\nYou could throw certain words at this game like crazy, unique or psychedelic and you would be right.\nSo what are you waiting for?\nGo on forth you Clown and hug everything!", "timestamp_created": 1441924188, "timestamp_updated": 1451656160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698005", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17974937": {"recommendationid": "17974937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002925508", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442207480}, "language": "english", "review": "The music alone is worth the cost of this game.

I loved everything about it. It has an original character in Dropsy the clown, who just want to help and befriend people, to make them happy.

You'll have to make sense of pictograms, which is presumably how Dropsy perceives and/or senses people's (but not only people's) feelings/ needs/ mood. There are some other clever mechanics at work here, since you can use your companions to assist Dropsy in his quests and additionally Dropsy can hug almost everyone and everything!\n\nThe game for the most part had quite a feel-good vibe going for it. The story will take some darker paths, eventually but there is always something positive or upbeat and it tries to never leave you in absolute depressive or bad mood. \n\nThe puzzles are logic and most of them are of easy difficulty. The game's world and many characters are quite weird (in a way that reminded me of the classic LucasArt's Sam 'n Max). The story is interesting and it will leave quite an impression on you.

I played the side game that put out for a game jam (Dropsy and the Black Lodge) and that just cemented this character for me.\n\nHe's an innocent. Probably one of the only pure innocents I've ever run into in gaming.\n\nI don't do a lot of standard reviews of games (and this is my first on Steam), but I love this game enough to write this.\n\nI honestly am not sure what to say that doesn't just sound like me gushing about Dropsy. So... I'm going to gush.\n\nThe audio is fantastic. The soundtrack helps set the mood (and the Dream-world tracks... some of my favorite).\n\nThe hand-drawn animation just fits. The first time you see Dropsy get excited because someone likes him, when you go to hug someone and they accept the hug... I'm actually getting a little emotional just thinking about it.\n\nJay does a fantastic job of including humor in the game. The emotional scenes hit you right in the feels. The laughter is contagious. And even the frightening gives me goose-bumps.\n\nControls are fairly standard Point-n-Click.\n\nThere is nothing written in the game. The visual method that characters use to communicate can take a little getting used to, but it's laid out simply enough that even a child can understand it.\n\nIt's not often that a game comes along that can literally be appealing to kids and adults, but my nine year old son is just as excited to play with Dropsy as I am.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?

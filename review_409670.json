Techniquement, ils se terminent chacun en 10 ou 15 minutes, sauf qu'apr\u00e8s les avoir termin\u00e9 une premi\u00e8re fois on d\u00e9bloque (dans chaque jeu) un mode \"hard\". Les niveaux sont globalement semblables mais bien plus acc\u00e8s sur les phases de plate-forme, c'est effectivement bien plus dur que le mode normal mais on se rend compte assez vite qu'on apprend \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser un peu mieux les niveaux \u00e0 chaque mort et c'est un plaisir de voir comme on finit par virevolter dans les premiers tableaux d'un niveau une fois qu'on a appris \u00e0 les maitriser.\n\nEt tout \u00e7a m'a donn\u00e9 envie de relancer [b]Kero Blaster[/b] en mode \"Zangyou\" (hard) aussi, juste pour voir. Et bien \u00e7a y est, je l'ai termin\u00e9 ! J'en ai profit\u00e9 pour lancer un New Game + qui se torche tr\u00e8s rapidement une fois qu'on connait bien le jeu (d'autant plus qu'on est sur\u00e9quip\u00e9 pendant une bonne partie du jeu) ; New Game + qui m'a permis au passage de me remettre les niveaux normaux en m\u00e9moire. Parce que oui, le NG+ c'est seulement pour le mode normal. \n\nEt donc : les niveaux en hard n'ont rien \u00e0 voir avec les niveaux normaux. Si le mode de base du jeu est un genre de [i]run'n gun[/i], les niveaux du mode Zangyou sont beaucoup plus acc\u00e8s plate-forme (et beaucoup plus punitifs). Les boss sont relativement semblables dans l'ensemble (on note tout de m\u00eame quelques diff\u00e9rences) mais on a droit a un tout nouveau boss final, vraiment pas facile facile ! La difficult\u00e9 principale des phases de plate-forme vient du fait que notre personnage a tr\u00e8s peu d'air-control (et le double-saut, qu'on finit par d\u00e9bloquer, a tendance a compliquer encore plus tout \u00e7a), c'est parfois frustrant parce que c'est quelque chose d'assez inhabituel, mais on finit par ma\u00eetriser (relativement) la chose est c'est tr\u00e8s satisfaisant de se rendre compte de nos progr\u00e8s au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu'on encha\u00eene les niveaux.\nCette progression est d'ailleurs tr\u00e8s importante puisqu'on meurt souvent et que toutes les trois vies perdues, c'est le game over qui nous renvoie au d\u00e9but du niveau. Mais c'est bien comme \u00e7a qu'on se rend compte que tel passage difficile, qu'on avait enfin r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 passer apr\u00e8s 10 minutes d'essais improductifs, et bien maintenant on le passe les yeux ferm\u00e9s, et que du fait que l'on ma\u00eetrise ces difficult\u00e9s, on peut maintenant traverser le niveau [U]beaucoup[/U] plus rapidement que les premi\u00e8res fois pour arriver au nouveau pi\u00e8ge qui nous pose probl\u00e8me, et ainsi de suite.\n\u00c9videmment, l'ambiance et les musiques sont au rendez-vous ! Je me suis surpris \u00e0 m'arr\u00eater dans certains niveaux, juste pour \u00e9couter la musique !\n\nEn bref, j'avais vraiment appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 le jeu la premi\u00e8re fois que je l'ai termin\u00e9, mais il me semblait un peu trop \"simpliste\", un peu court, et dans l'ensemble assez loin d'\u00e9galer le souvenir que j'avais gard\u00e9 de Cave Story (pour le comparer \u00e0 un jeu du m\u00eame d\u00e9v'). Refaire Kero Blaster (et ses deux \"d\u00e9mos\", Pink Hour et Pink Heaven que je recommande vraiment, encore une fois) en mode hard m'a permis de l'appr\u00e9cier autrement et je trouve finalement que c'est un tr\u00e8s bon jeu qui transpire l'amour du d\u00e9tail et du level design bien pens\u00e9 !

another game which i admittedly have not played\nbut do not bother downloading this game, it is garbage, why did people spend time making this\nit's almost cool, which is the really infuriating thing about it\nbut the game design of this tiny little piece of video game is fucking atrocious\nwhy would you make the default controls the god damn arrow keys, are you an elementary school student in 1999\nand why would you make a game that is not a platformer have jumps that you can miss by just failing to hold down the jump button, there's no skill reward there, just punishment for not paying too much attention to your stupid control scheme\ni love difficult games, and this is not one, but it has a few game design pitfalls which create an illusion of difficulty which is in no way rewarding, which is one of the worst possible things i could say about a game\nit's like all the shitty frustrating aspects of mario and megaman, without any of the fun interesting parts of either one\nto elaborate, the fun part of mario was the skill based platforming, the elegant movement scheme that allowed you to just fly through the game if you were a true master at it's simple yet deep movement\nand the fun part of megaman was the skill based combat, with just enough platforming to make the movement important, but mostly you wanted to get to the boss fights, which functioned as a perfect climax to the interest curve of a well designed level\nin this game, the platforming is fucking stupid, and you can literally just skip the boss fight by jumping over him\nnot beat the boss but jumping over him like in mario, but skip it, with none of the satisfaction of beating it, with one incredibly easy jump\ni don't write many reviews, but this was pathetic and stupid enough that i felt compelled to kick it, partially because most of the other reviews are positive, so i can at least be a minority dissenting voice\nand the pathetic attempt to directly promote kero blaster at the very end was frankly repulsive\n\nfor the record, kero blaster might be awesome, i have no idea, but i will never try it because this game sucked that bad", "timestamp_created": 1498197527,

It only provides a single stage (plus a modified version for Hard Mode, which is unlocked after completing the normal mode), but it's worth checking out nevertheless. \n\nThe platforming is nice and tight, and the movement/firing mechanics are very cool. If you're on the fence about Kero Blaster, this should give you a good idea of if you'll like it.\n\nWhat I found cool about Pink Hour is that you can complete the game, both in Normal and Hard Mode, without firing your projectile at enemies. You can actually complete it without damaging any enemies at all, including the boss.

And toned down, it's a cute, serviceable little preview romp for Kero Blaster. I'd recommend it, sure.\n\nThe problem is that the formerly mandated Hard Mode (which you can still unlock by beating this on easy) is absolute screaming horseshit on toast. It's an agonizingly precision-based platformer over a series of instant death pits with Ninja Gaiden style bats flying in your face, and a player character that controls with ten times more inertia than is appropriate for this setup. I cannot make it past the first screen. This having been my first impression when it came out, it absolutely DESTROYED any and all interest I had in trying Kero Blaster, which I was previously reasonably hyped for. The lives system only makes it even worse.\n\nSo, go ahead and try it I guess, but don't expect anything good to come of Hard Mode.", "timestamp_created": 1450606082, "timestamp_updated": 1450606082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.400526", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19797124": {"recommendationid": "19797124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138065122", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450589703}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00c9 demais!

Studio Pixel crafted a wonderful little game worth playing over and over again, and it's a gaming classic to me. \n\nBut this is a review for Pink Hour, not Cave Story. That game will get its turn eventually, but let me start of by saying Daisuke Amaya (otherwise known as Pixel) hasn't lost his touch for game design. Similar graphics, similar musical style, similar gameplay...This feels like a tech demo for another big project of Pixel's (and from what I hear, it is). But for someone who hasn't played any of Pixel's games, is it worth checking out?\n\nWell, I feel this kind of game best fits the kind of crowd who likes run-and-gun platforming, and doesn't mind the old-school aesthetic. The game is fair enough to make it through in one shot, unless you're completely inept at platforming/dodging obstacles. If there's one complaint I can make, it's that you can't change the direction of your projectiles while holding the fire button. Cave Story didn't have this problem, so it took me a while to get used to this change.\n\nIn short, I'd say this is worth playing at least once. If you're looking for something meatier (and have some extra cash to blow off), I'd say play Cave Story afterwards.

I give this game 8/10.\n\nThe 1st ending is the same as for normal and hard mode if you lose the missing document after getting it, when Pink-Clad reach back to her office, she began to worry, on how to explain to her boss that she lost the missing document, so she went in, and explain herself, but her boss didn't get mad at her, because somehow her boss already has the missing document, and Pink-Clad became confuse when it got rip to shreds in front of her; Pink-Clad went back to her desk, later on her boss came out and drop a very large stack of work on Pink-Clad desk, and told her she has to finish all that by the end of the day, so Pink-Clad sign, started to work on the large stack of work that pile on her desk.

Later on after Pink-Clad was leaving from work, she went to a video game store, to see if she can get a copy of Kero Blaster, the store clerk ask Pink-Clad \"I didn't know you were into games.\" Pink-Clad reply \"Oh no it's for my brother.\" so the store cleark asked what she was looking for, but when Pink-Clad ask for Kero Blaster he wasn't sure if he had a copy, so he show Pink-Clad few games if they were the game she speaks of, but Pink-Clad gave up, decided to check else where, but before Pink-Clad was about to leave the store clerk said \"Wait, is this it?\" Pink-Clad reply \"YES! that the one\" so the store clerk gave her Kero Blaster, and Pink-Clad went home.

It's a typical 2D platformer. You can shoot and move and dodge obstacles and all that. The story is pretty silly, but cute. You play as Pink, an office worker, who must obtain a document for her boss in one piece. It's located underground, for some reason, and she can blast enemies, somehow. You gotta roll with it.\n\nThe difficulty is pretty simple, so it's not a particularly stressful endeavor, and a fair amount of people are going to beat this on their first go. The graphics are simple and pixelated, and not particularly bad, though not the neatest looking either. There's only one boss fight, but funnily enough, you can skip it if you jump far enough and at the right time to go over its head. There's two different endings you can get here; one for bringing the document back, and one for beating the game without it (if you get damaged, for example). The ending for beating it with the document gives you a short cutscene, leading to the store page for Kero Blaster, which is a nice way to promote your game (since this is an advertisement for the game, after all).\n\nThere's a hard mode you can unlock if you beat the game, which extends its replayability just a little bit. Because I'm not the best at video games, this took me a lot longer than it probably should have, but it's still pretty beatable in under an hour. What makes the mode so hard is that Pink (the character you control) tends to float when she jumps, which can make it easy to over or underaim when you jump. This isn't bad in the regular mode, but in hard mode, some platforms are only barely big enough to where you have to jump perfectly. I'm not particularly a fan of the \"perfect jump\" difficulty in games, so a good portion of the hard mode wasn't too fun, and the second-to-last screen right after the boss fight took up maybe the most time on my hard mode attempts. However, once you figure it out, you'll be able to get the rhythm down and blow through it pretty fast. There's an ending to unlock here if you beat it with the document, leading into either Kero Blaster or Pink Heaven.\n\nThe game is fun for the short amount of time it offers, and while I'm not a fan of the jumping, the game isn't punishing and doesn't want to be arbitrarily hard. It's a nice relaxing time overall. Also, it's free, so there's no stress over cost per playtime. The one downside for some people may be that there are no achievements or trading cards, but this isn't a loss in my book, considering how straightforward the game is.

I recommend getting it if/when it goes on sale.\n\nNeeds a lot of polish; controls are sometimes awkward and UI needs polish, for example when you bring up your mission list, there's a \"show me where\" button, but this only highlights the system that the destination is in. You need to then click on that system to zoom into it, so that you can then click on your destination to set it as a waypoint. They really could have had a \"add destination as waypoint\" button straight from the mission screen. Autopilot also seems to be buggy. You're supposed to be able to press Z to turn on autopilot, but if the autopilot drives near a star, the autopilot \"disengages\" and there does not seem to be a way to re-engage the autopilot except to quit the game and relaunch it.\n\nThe main mission narrative is enjoyable, but there's way too much filler content. The game would have been better if shorter and more focused. Mining is not particularly fun, shooting garbage is not particularly fun, salvaging derelict ships is not particularly fun, taxying and acting as a courier is not particularly fun. Took me about 10 hours to beat the main game, and then another 5 hours to \"shoot 1000 garbage\", \"completel 50 taxi missions\", and all the other filler achievements. NPCs also felt shallow. You can do \"random chat\" with them, or read their biographies, but there's no incentive to care about any of this. Feels like there was a missed opportunity to have them deliver side quests to you.\n\nThere's basically 3 classes of ships in this game: traders, fighters, and all-arounders. When you get to the last boss, you can't switch your ship, so I got kind of screwed there because I had to do a massive boss fight in my trader ship. Took several tries and reloads but I eventually got it. Would have been nice if I could have just switched to a fighter ship for that boss fight though -- everywhere else in the game except for the introductory tutorial, you can switch your ships at will as long as you have the money.\n\nThe music was both a pro and a con for this game. There's some really nice track that give it that great 80s vibe. The thing is that they chose songs with lyrics, which means the music is very salient to the player, instead of being a background element. This is not necessarily bad, but because there's not that many different tracks in the game, it becomes very obvious very quickly when they start repeating the same tracks over and over. I think if you're going to use tracks with lyrics, you need to \"use them once\" for a set-piece moment. Take a look at how Saints Row uses the \"I Need a Hero\" or \"Power\" songs, for example.", "timestamp_created": 1513568601, "timestamp_updated": 1513568601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593243", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38384463": {"recommendationid": "38384463", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969377624", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513528899}, "language": "english", "review": "Very enjoyable so far.", "timestamp_created": 1513538931, "timestamp_updated": 1513538931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38383638": {"recommendationid": "38383638", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979370112", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 133, "last_played": 1514398899}, "language": "english", "review": "Just fantastic.\nIt knows what it is, and it does it well.\nThe creators clearly love this game, and games in general.

Like a green onion and cheddar omelet made by a world renown chef while the chef is hungover from a night of binge drinking, yet could still make this dish in their sleep. So lets get down to the gritty details.\n\nPros:  The soundtrack (while slightly fluffy and vapid at times) is quite catchy and will have you bobbing your head as long as nobody is around to see you and question your masculinity. The songs do borrow heavily from many highly recognizable songs from popular charts which will remain unnamed, but they do a good enough job of establishing themselves to be forgivable.\n\nTons of nostalgia and references to produce chuckles under your breath and make you feel special for knowing the thing that the game is talking about or depicting. You snowflake you! :p\n\nEasy to grasp fun mechanics and controls.\n\nSufficient career options and upgrades to explore making the experience feel all that more expansive and inclusive.\n\nDecently entertaining story which does a good job of immersing you in it.\n\n\nCons: Quests can seem repetitive and boring after grinding for a bit. \n\nSome elements aren\u2019t very intuitive and feel buggy and/or frustrating at times such as bounty hunting or some elements of travel.\n\n\n\tAll in all, this game is a lot of fun and shouldn\u2019t disappoint anybody interested in the science fiction genre.", "timestamp_created": 1509575197, "timestamp_updated": 1509580414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537538", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36069664": {"recommendationid": "36069664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076834193", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509177604}, "language": "english", "review": "After seeing so many positive reviews, I was impressed and decided to buy since I love just about anything Sci-Fi and leveling up weapons and spacecraft. About two hours in, I realized it was going to be pretty monotonous - the game, in essence, is travelling from one mini game to another which can be tedious and annoying. I find I end up spending a significant amount of game time on my facebook waiting for my ship again and again to cross the map to get to the next story point inevitably with some variation of the same mini game involved. The mini games include exploring extremely simple, and significantly uninteresting derelict ships, hauling junk from one part of the map to another for money, providing taxi services for money, and taking pictures of random people who don't have any story impact also for money (like you're helping people stalk others for money). I wasn't able to get a refund since I played it just over two hours before trying to return it, so as cheap as I am, I decided I'm just going to finish out the story, not do another unnecessary odd job/mini game within the game, and upgrade the ship and probably won't ever visit this title again. \n\nThe dogfights are probably the most interesting thing about the game, but that's not saying much. With enough patience, and even with your first ship, you could literally take down any enemy ship simply by strafing around the enemy and shooting. They'll never be able to hit you with their shots and their missles you can blow up by pressing shift when the missle is in range to be self destructed. And that summarizes every dogfight, even if you have 5-10 ships shooting at you - Just strafe, blow up missles, shoot and you win. Simple.\n\nAlso, the dialogue is terrible, unwitty, and cliche. Even when the game tries to make fun of itself, it does so in a way that generally isn't humorous for anyone over the age of 10. It makes fun of itself so frequently, I begin to wonder if the developers intentionally put absurd things in the game just to create a dialogue that makes fun of it. Because they use vulgar language, they can't market the game towards what I think would be a more appropriate audience: children 10 and younger. \n\nOverall, the game is boring, uninteresting, monotonous, and simply, just not a very creative game. If you're still considering getting the game, definitely wait for a discount, or try it and be sure to return it within two hours which is all it takes really to experience just about everything the game has to offer without completing the story.", "timestamp_created": 1509179387, "timestamp_updated": 1509179387, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529134", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36015513": {"recommendationid": "36015513", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971456433", "num_games_owned": 574, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467442980}, "language": "italian", "review": "Eccezionale", "timestamp_created": 1509030322, "timestamp_updated": 1509030322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35993154": {"recommendationid": "35993154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002240893", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511296719}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy it.

Why not sorted by type first?\n- Option to turn off theese forced dialogues while mining\n- Derelicts feel so cool but have not dangers... Hacking the desks? R.I.P.? The squids...? Radiation?\n- More mission types and story arcs.\n- modding/workshop support\n\n- gfx are a bit dated but add to the charm of the game - don't change/modernize/upgrade it to a \"full hd version\"!\n\nI would love to get another enhanced version of the game!", "timestamp_created": 1508695170, "timestamp_updated": 1508695170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547708", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35916478": {"recommendationid": "35916478", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971303952", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508812543}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game that I wish there was more of!

Tampoco faltan piratas, naves desconocidas y \"criaturas\" a los que dar caza si nos decantamos por el combate.\n\nPara los que decidan dedicarse al comercio hay gran cantidad de recursos englobados en una economia din\u00e1mica con los que conseguir beneficios (t\u00edpico sistema de \"en el sector A el titanio se vende muy barato y en el sistema B se compra muy caro), un buen n\u00famero de naves (desde peque\u00f1as y r\u00e1pidas naves para el combate, a grandes y lentas naves de transporte, pasando por naves militares) con sus correspondintes mejoras y actualizaciones. Naturalmente tampoco faltaran los t\u00edpicos trabajos de chico de los paquetes, taxi, etc, con los que hacer dinero r\u00e1pido.\n\nEn definitiva, un gran juego lleno de detalles, humor y muchas horas de juego si te gusta el g\u00e9nero... y no esperas gr\u00e1ficos ultraHD 8k, claro.\n\n\n\nUn saludo.", "timestamp_created": 1505931451, "timestamp_updated": 1505931451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35078902": {"recommendationid": "35078902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035654256", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506800897}, "language": "english", "review": "I sat down once playing this game...

You need to save your game, unlike most console titles now, but I've found 3030 is fairly forgiving of missteps, I'd have killed me for running out of fuel.  Strongly recommended for sandbox gamers and folks with limited game time.\n\nPretty good soundtrack, but it begins to get repetitive after ten hours.\n\nA fair number of ship models to choose from but I would have liked more.

Without the constraints of being too \"realistic\" or \"edgy\" or \"simulator\" oriented, the devs are able to tell a story free from the shackles of having to EXPLAIN the science of it all, while at the same time, reference countless sci fi genre tropes with blatantly in your face easter eggs. \n\nFor anyone who has played and loved Games like Star Control or especially Space Quest, you will instantly appreciate this. \n\nI have only had a short time with the game, and I can already see myself enjoying the open world space exploration and combat, and the humorous story and dialogue are right up my alley keeping it fresh and fun. \n\nIt doesn't hold your hand too much, you have to figure a few things out as you go, but it does a fair job of guiding you to learning the ropes as you play.  Gently suggesting at the next reasonable course of action to get yourself back on track ASAP. \n\nIt's not a perfect game by any means, and if you aren't into the brand of humor and gameplay it uses to tell it's a story you might not care for it at all.

However, had this come out in the 80s or 90s, it would have been a classic that would have shaped a generation of gamers perception of how to do a space sci fi game for the next decade.  \n\nIf you still have a soft spot for the old classics like the ones I mentioned at the start, you need grab this game and make a nice hot Tea and sit down on a rainy day and give this a whirl.

Due to some crazy prophecy dealing with bird names and a ship loaded to the ceiling with gold, all scavengers get a bullseye on their heads. This is where our story begins and things get even more crazy, with interesting characters, factions, and of course space travel.\n\n3030 Death War Redux is an open space simulator, now the \"Redux\" part means that this is a revitalization. It's important to note because I didn't play the game back in its original heyday. I have only played this new version of the game. So keep in mind this won't be a comparison of the two but more of analyzation of what is in the game now. From what I understand, the graphics, story, side quests, balancing and a whole plethora of things are getting the overhaul from the previous iteration.\n\nUsually, when I play these types of games, I find them to be almost exactly like space itself, a dark vacuum of nothing and where everything takes forever to do. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of content and missions but more importantly, the universe felt alive.  Boarding any station, greeted me every time with a slew of strange aliens, alien interiors, and quirky conversations. It was like the Star Wars cantina scene and I honestly couldn't get enough. This is one of the areas the game absolutely shines as you go about from station to station, collecting missions, making contacts, and trying to stay alive. Even arriving at a station was a dazzling display of holographic ad ships, and other kinds of ships buzzing in and out.\n\nOver all, the mechanics are very reminiscent of the genre. You start with nothing and build yourself up. You can trade, escort, pick up cargo, bounty hunt, and perform many other tasks to build up your cash and eventually get a bigger, badder ship. One thing that I found unique to 3030 was the ability to scavenge derelict space ships for supplies, cargo, etc. The few times I did manage to find a destroyed vessel, my pulse would begin to race, wondering what I might find. You can't see very far and only have a small scanning droid to assist you locate items of importance. This is one area I definitely would love for them to expand on. Turn up the horror aspect and add some procedural design and scavenging can be practically its own game, if done right.\n\nAnother area that absolutely blew my mind was the games soundtrack. I don't say this very often but 3030 has one of the best and most well integrated soundtracks. The music has this awesome techno synth thing going that seems shot out of the 80's. You might think that doesn't work with this type of game but it really, really does. There are also some other instrumental pieces and alternative choices as some of the songs are licensed, and may cause an issue for streamers/youtubers.\n\nKeep in mind that 3030 is in Early Access, so there is still things that need polish and attention. The game crashed a few times on me randomly. Also the UI isn't the most user friendly, I seriously wish there was a way to zoom in. If you play the game you will feel as if you are unnaturally far away from the action. I don't know if this is intended or something that is going to be addressed. The graphics/art style themselves are rather appealing to the eye. Consoles are rusted or dirty, other parts of the station show inhabitants going about their daily lives. Screens flicker with news and bartenders stroll back and forth. The galaxy itself looks great, with nebulas, stars, and everything in between. I just wish I could see it a bit better.\n\nOne of the biggest gripes I came away with was the combat in 3030. Combat is a bit of a mess and I still didn't quite understand the finer points after about six hours of playing. You have missiles and lasers and more or less just ending up shooting each other in the face and hope you have more hit-points. This is going back to the camera just being placed so far away that pin pointing shots is downright exasperating at times. Taking on more then one enemy is a logistical nightmare and sadly, enemies tend to attack in large groups. I tried using the different movement modes and found the same results. While I am not sure how to fix the combat, I can tell you it wasn't my favorite aspect for sure.\n\nThankfully combat isn't the most important aspect to the game, but it is obviously vital. I personally would recommend avoiding combat like the plague, but your mileage may vary. Plus there are more than enough other activities that can earn you tons of cash.\n\nWhen you look at space simulators, they are a very ambitious type of game. You have almost as much work as someone would do for an MMORPG but for a single player game. Not only do you have to fine tune your basic mechanics of combat, but you have to micro manage dozens of systems such as factions, economy, and any story you may want to have. It's no small task and not an easy one, so obviously I will reserve judgement for final release. That being said the most important part for me, in these types of games, is an aspect that 3030 Deathwar Redux already has in oodles. It has personality, charm, and the universe feels alive.\n\nPlus any game that throws in Crow T. Robot as a bartender has got my vote.

You can take on jobs to earn money, fly around space and explore freely or try to find out why your ship was impounded. This version of the game adds a ton more stuff like more story, more characters, balance tweaks and much much more.\n\nThe graphics are in a retro 8-bit pixel style and i think they are well done although they might take some getting used to at first.\n\nThe first part of the game gives you a little run down on how to operate your space suit and has you track down salvage for a bit and after a cutscene or two has you fly your ship to the nearest space station. Both the space suit and space ship parts were really well done in my oppinion and i found it neat that you aren't confined to your space ship.\n\nThe music also really stood out in this game and really tied the whole game together.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nif your looking for a space adventure with a lot of freedom, good music and a solid story then i'd say give this one a go !", "timestamp_created": 1475786425, "timestamp_updated": 1475786425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25594923": {"recommendationid": "25594923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010606664", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488500700}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely fantastic so far!

However, this does not affect my views and opinions of the game.\n\n3030 Deathwar Redux is a 2D open-world space adventure, though there are elements of many other genres within the game. Most of the time you spend the game flying your ship from place to place completing tasks, and when you're doing so, the game plays like the old-school game; \"Asteroids\" or other spaceship shooters. The rest of the time, your character is either on space stations picking up new jobs, trading, and talking to people OR at derelicts salvaging materials and other items. There is a variety of things to do within the game, and there is SOME element of choice making as well. The game may remind some people of \"Space Pirates and Zombies\", though I feel like this title offers a very unique experience on it's own.\n\n--------\n\n[b] Graphics: 8 / 10 [/b]\n\nArt-style is subjective, and at first I didn't really enjoy the pixel design of the game (and usually I do). After playing the game for awhile, the style of the game really grew on me. The graphics of the game are really well done. The style is unique, and it gives the game a lot of charm. There's an abundance of characters and races, each with their own unique and interesting design. Most of the space-stations and derelicts you enter look kinda the same internally (with the exception of small details), though the exterior appearance of these places are really different and neat. Of course, this game's motif is space, so there is a ton of space themed objects, designs and graphics, though the game puts them together quite nicely. While traveling in space, there's usually a lot happening on screen. There's cargo ships, police and other vessels just roaming around (which you can interact with). When you're not around a station however, just traveling to another place, there isn't a whole lot happening aside from you passing by planets, asteroids, and derelicts IF you see them. The game is not too demanding, it should run fine on a low - mid-tier graphics card and CPU. \n\n--------\n\n[b] Sound: 8 / 10 [/b]\n\nThe sound assets are just fine. All the gun sounds, ambient space sounds, and general space themed noises are great and fit right in with theme of the game. The main reason this game ranks so well in it's sound category is because of the amazing soundtrack/background music that plays throughout the game. There are quite a bit of beautiful vocal tracks within the game as well as some instrumentals. The only complaint I'd have about this is that; tracks don't loop or switch to another track after finishing. Though this is a minor personal gripe as you're usually not in space long enough for the track to finish (though sometimes you are). This also might annoy or bother some players because they might deem it as \"repetitive\" sounds. All in all, the soundtrack is amazing and I really hope they release an OST. \n\n--------\n\n[b] Mechanics: 8 / 10 [/b] \n\nThe mechanics are really well-done. There's so much to do in the game, though that being said, it is possible that the game might feel repetitive after \"grinding\" out side-jobs for cash. The good news is that there's a lot of different things you can do for cash. Some of these things depend on the kind of ship you own, and what kind of upgrades you have, but these things are not that difficult to obtain. The most basic thing you can do is dock at various space-stations and use the job console to find jobs; these kind of jobs include taxi services, package deliveries, trash clean-up, photo-taking, towing services and a few more that you can unlock through playing the game. Some of these jobs have time limits, and having a faster ship may be helpful. Some of these jobs also require you to have a certain amount of cabins or cargo space on your ship.   \n \nThere are also bounties you can take from the job console which help you hunt down space pirates for more cash, as well as loot their ships. Completing/not completing these jobs can impact your reputation which can have effects on various things or conversations. You can also find space pirates in each space system without having to take a \"mission\" for it. Sometimes civilians on space stations will also have jobs for you when you talk to them. You can also harvest asteroid fields for minerals and ore which you can sell at trade consoles. Trade consoles are also at space stations. Each station sells and buys goods at different prices, so trading is another way cash can be made. \n\nAnother way to make cash within the game is to become a pirate yourself. You can ram into cargo ships, destroy civilian ships and work at pirate outposts. Though usually this gets you in trouble with the law, as well as places a bounty on your head. There may be other ways to make cash later on in the game. There are also a few random events that happen every now and then that may grant the player rewards.\n\nThe flying and combat in the game is simple. You use the arrow keys to move around and hit the space and enter keys to fire off your weapons. The movement style is sort of like those other float-y movement space-shooters. You can buy different weapons and missiles to fit to your ship, as well as other ship upgrades. Not all ships can be fitted with the same equipment, so knowing which ships are good for battle and which are good for other missions is important. Although this might not affect everyone; the controls of the game take a while to get used to as they don't feel right or comfortable when first played (for both flying in space and walking around). \n\n-------- \n\n[b] Final Personal Remarks: [/b]\n\nThe first time I played the game I wasn't too keen on the graphic style, like I said earlier, it really grew on me. There are some aspects of the game I don't partake in (such as derelicts) because I still haven't completely gotten used to the design. That being said, I still think the game looks great. The story seems really interesting, and it looks like you unlock and discover new things as you go through it. The game's tone is a little humorous and actually does have neat references. The dialogue in the game is great, and is actually worth reading in my opinion. The devs spent a lot of time with the dialogue, as there's so much of it from almost every NPC you meet. The game has a real charm and I really enjoy games like this where you have to try and make money somehow, but also gives you so many ways to do so. The music is lovely and I wish there was an OST or something somewhere. The game is currently in early access but has lots to offer. Even though more and more features are being added to the game, I believe it's already really good as it is.\n\nThanks to \"[url=https://pcgamesnnews.wordpress.com/]PC Games n News[/url]\" for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.", "timestamp_created": 1472514497, "timestamp_updated": 1473739085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.678335", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25045811": {"recommendationid": "25045811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048729780", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1514078517}, "language": "english", "review": "My favorite top down space combat/trading game.

Confusing I know but it's to the game's benefit.\n\nThis is an open-galaxy space adventure with a mid-90s DOS aesthetic. There's a story which you can follow or not as you choose and there's also a variety of activities to undertake, including trading, one-off missions, piracy and scavenging derelicts for resources which can be used to upgrade your ship and its capabilities. The core concept are very much reminiscent of older games in the genre like Privateer, Freelancer or even Elite to a certain degree. The story seems kind of generic and goofy but in a Firefly sort of way that doesn't take itself at all seriously which I can appreciate.\n\nPeople are either going to find the retro graphics endearing or eye burning. I'm very much in the former camp, as someone who grew up in that era of gaming. It also has the advantage of making the game's requirements very low, so you can easily play it on lower power laptops when on the go. It contols entirely with the keyboard as well. The soundtrack is incredibly varied and diverse and while a lot of the songs seem contextually out of place, it's still great to see so many different tracks available in some many genres. You'll spend a lot of time travelling out in space so having good stuff to listen to is always a bonus.\n\nMy complaints with it at this stage of development are the mission variety and that scavenging hulks is painfully samey. The missions are the usual crop of delivery, bounty hunting or transport missions but that's kind of it. Some more mixing up of that would be nice. In addition, scavenging a derelict literally just involves flying up to it, watching an animation, moving down a tiny hallway that never has anything in it but the loot, picking up the loot and watching another animation. The developers have said they plan to flesh this out more and I hope they do.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a game that pays homage to the old school \"space trucking\" genre and has every intention to.

I love the atmosphere and I love how the world progresses and feels like it evolves throughout, with headlines and news articles going on as things unfold around you, when in stations the seperate semi-visible other portions of the stations with vehicles and whatnot, and the intercom calling out new intakes of Stock and depertures etc. You can totally imagine this being a viable and real world and it's amazing. \n\nStory so far is pretty great, can't really say anything without spoilers but it's pretty interesting but sometimes it may be confusing as it ends up progressing whilst you're not doing \"story missions\" where sometimes it just does stuff as time goes on.\n\nSettings and whatnot are very good, for youtubers / streamers you can avoid the ballache of editing and copyright strikes from a basement dweller thanks to the devs including the option to disable copywrited tracks in the settings. And my personal favourite, you can check to turn of vocal music and only have instrumental, which I absolutely love and it makes the experience much better. Graphics options are plentiful for allsorts of various options and crap if your system has trouble processing some stuff.\n\nOnly negatives I can think of are the map is a little strange and doesn't auto-update nebula spots, you can't really set a course to an undiscovered star system, and also the scavenging mini-part is very short and I feel it would be really exciting to expand upon. Honestly haven't looked much/at all into the development so far so take this with a mound of salt, but the salvaging / inside of ship stuff would be super cool to have more details and exploration towards.\n\nCombat is very fun and basic, maybe be somewhat hard to figure out at first, and honestly battles seem to lean in favour of whoever can turn the hardest because if they can auto-manuever you you're pretty fucked, even in a pretty heavy ship, unless you got missiles or something. I stick with tiny ships haven't gone into heavy stuff much tbh.\n\nAside from that, a very fun game to hop into and play for a good few hours. I'd say honestly 7.5/10 But definately leaning towards more an 8-9/10 and especially when this becomes more improved in the future, I seriously can't wait it's been very fun so far, just feel the 'little things' are missing here and there.

It has all the top-down real-time space stuff you could ask for in a large open-roam universe, trading, quests, combat and even some adventure. The trading is simple but well implemented, stuff is worth more in different systems and you can play the market to your benefit while steadily upgrading to bigger and bigger ships. The quests are also well-done with the usual variation, combat, delivey, discovery, salvage, mining, bounty-hunting, etc. The combat is like a souped-up version of Asteriod, control your momentum, dodge the enemy's bullets and missle while firing your own.\n\nThe games main strengths lie in its writing and its music. While every station is much the same format of bar, hanger, trade and job areas, each character you encounter (and there are so many) has a little dialogue tree and intresting things to say. In fact, the adventuring and dialogue trees are great in that they call back to old choose-your-own-adventure and point'n'click adventure games while meshing into the actual space-flying-around-part. Also the music is great, up-beat and catchy pop for flying around and suitable instrumental stuff for the adventure parts.\n\nThe main weaknesses of the game came from it's Early Access nature. There aren't as many resolutions as you'd hope, there's no option to change the controls from flying with the arrows to flying with WASD (a personal bugbear of mine) and some the story quests aren't as flexible as they should be. For example, in an early story quest somebody was gunning for me and, being out-gunned, I ran away to another system. I was then treated to a little pixel cutscene implying I killed the guy I ran away from.\n\nAll-in-all though, a solid, quirky game they may actually end up sucking away hours upon hours of your time.", "timestamp_created": 1461927434, "timestamp_updated": 1461927434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463746", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22701801": {"recommendationid": "22701801", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991996247", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1513689309}, "language": "english", "review": "Played the old free version, it is much better game now .", "timestamp_created": 1461923340, "timestamp_updated": 1461923486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459220", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22701141": {"recommendationid": "22701141", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978498743", "num_games_owned": 1087, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480387852}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow only 5 reviews so far?

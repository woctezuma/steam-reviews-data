The main objective is to coordinate your airstrip and land planes, but there so many other little elements in this game that stand out.

It can get stressful, but it's really a blast and has been a hit at parties.\n\nThere's a good depth to this game with many different elements and mechanics, so it has good replayability.

I write a lengthy review in the hopes that it will reach the development team if they ever update the game. \n\nIt was super fun at first. Metro Airport is by far the most compelling level, and the flawless challenge was addicting as hell, trying to manage 3 runways and running unnecessarily aggressive squeeze plays with airliners is so fun. The amount of close calls when I land on 2L and launch on 11 causes serious and hilarious tension. You have to learn to keep track of who you clear and where, because if you forget one, people die. In the time I played, I definitely felt myself get more and more competent managing traffic, spacing adequately and limiting the number of collisions and making it farther and farther each time. Big airports were what this game was designed for, and I was disappointed to see there was only one. It was a lot of fun for the first two hours.\n\nAs I got better and better, I noticed things that were clearly rushed in development, as if \u201csmall\u201d issues were deferred to meet deadlines and push the game out. Understandable, but I was operating under the impression that I had little value as a controller in this world, that the game didn\u2019t have any respect for the magnitude of responsibility of safely controlling airplanes. \n\nMy first and biggest issue was with the ground vehicles. They don\u2019t stop for airplanes, they will randomly drive onto and stop on active runways, and sometimes at the north terminal the catering truck will crash into the airplane that\u2019s safely parked at the northeast-most gate. The catering truck will sometimes just spawn up north right next to an airplane I have holding short of 11 and ram into it. Once, just off 2L, I had to stop taxiing an airliner because the catering truck was approaching. The catering truck stopped directly in front of the airplane for about five seconds, giving the ambulance ample time to approach from the north and ram full-speed into the side of the airplane, forcing me to start over. Instead of being cautious and meticulous, the ground vehicles are random and reckless. It seems like they are actively trying to run into the airplanes. I understand the need for an additional micromanagement challenge, but I feel this is more a \u201crandom death chance\u201d mechanic that was just poorly executed. It\u2019s immensely demoralizing to be on a roll sequencing and spacing just to have a round cut short by a rogue ground vehicle. \n\nNext, sometimes the auto-pathing of uncontrolled aircraft will cause them to randomly have a mid-air collision. Focused on sequencing and boom, a random midair on the other side of the map and the round is over. \n\nLastly, the UI just seems unimpressive. It\u2019s not necessarily bad, just unwieldy, as if they designed it on day 1 and never improved it. \n\nThis game was way fun at first and I\u2019d recommend the initial experience as money well-spent on a VR game.

The core of the game is built around air traffic control and guiding planes through landing and take off while keeping them from crashing into each other.  Sounds kind of \"plane\" but its actually a lot more fun than it sounds.  \n\nThe gameplay is quite original.  You use your hand to touch planes and draw a line in the air to give them a flight path.  Better keep the lines smooth and the turns gradual or they might crash.  A small plane might be able to make a tight turn but a jumbo jet can't.  There are also lots of mini games you have to keep on top of to keep things running like loading bags into the right carts, shooing birds off the runway and putting out the occasional engine fire.  On the Navy fleet level you can defend the fleet with some anti-aircraft guns.\n\nThere are quite a few locations and levels.  From the lonely island airport to the international airport, to the big city, to the navy fleet.  The first levels are easy and laid back but as you progress youve got to handle things quickly.  There are always multiple things going on at once at the international airport.  Once youve mastered the missions the challenge levels will definitely keep you busy.  They take a lot of effort to perfect.\n\nThe visuals are as good as the video and screenshots indicate.  Even though it is cartoony looking it is still highly detailed.  You'll find yourself kneeling down to the floor occasionally to look at all the tiny buildings and structures.\n\nOverall this game is a great value for it's current price of $15.

Essentially, you have toy-sized planes flying into your room and you have to give them a flight path to the airstrip while avoiding crashing into other planes (if you've ever played the mobile game Flight Control, it's a very similar idea).\n\nThis is of itself really entertaining and can get pretty frantic. What really brings in the 'holy crap' experience is the ground tasks. Occasionally, you'll have to help out on the airfield (e.g. helping douse the flames on a burning plane that's made an emergency landing or clearing birds off the airfield). Suddenly the little 'toys' you've been playing with, the miniature airfield playset, are writ large. A hundred metres off, you can see the jumbo airliner you just guided down to the airstrip, the thumb-sized bus you had to steer one of the little gliders around is now passing by you, and it's the size of a bus! Something about seeing the whole scene you've been standing over suddenly and dramatically in life size reinforces the god-like role of the player. It's a unique and almost humbling experience. \n\nThen you realise you've been staring too long and two new planes that appeared while you were chasing birds crash into each other miles above.

Then you tap on planes waiting to take off, then they take off.\n\nThat's the first level.\n\nThe second is an international airport where you land jumbo jets, draw lines to move them to get to terminals, repair planes, and airlift generators onto roofs and switch them on.\n\nAll in all it's just a whole lot of... not much. The ideas in the game feel VERY disjointed. It seems like the developers sat there and asked themselves \"What can we do to make this more difficult? - Right! We can make cars drive around an international airport and crash into your planes unless you stop them!\" For someone playing with air control, the game doesn't seem to respect the fact that the player is put into a position of care and basically just tries to fuck up your efforts 'to make it harder.'\n\nIt's a mish mash of elements that artifically bulk up what is effectively a very easy 'draw a line and land some planes' game. People say it's one of the more beautiful games but I'd disagree. The UI feels asthetically disjointed, the controller models are disjointed, the scale feels very wrong and the level design doesn't feel credible in the slightest.\n\nIf you enjoy multitasking little mini games for long periods of time, then this game is for you.

A good value because as of this time (7/15/16) if you buy it, you get the seated Final Approach pilot edition as well, which while similar puts a whole new twist of allowing you to actually pilot the planes. I look at it as a whole package let\u2019s call it Final Approach :Definitive Edition.   \n\nI still like the room scale version better though, it\u2019s such a kick to go stomping around the airports like some kind of giant, plucking planes and helos out of the sky to do your bidding.  \n\nThe game itself is an Air Traffic control sim, but takes a more arcade approach to it, you aren't just staring at a screen spitting out call signs and tail numbers. You are right in the midst of the action, creating flight paths, rescuing planes that need an emergency landing. You will also tackle a variety of other aviation related tasks, from being zoomed down to ground view to put out fires, or scare away birds on the run way with an air horn, and later there\u2019s even more stuff to do, taxing airliners to their terminals, sending others of to get repaired, picking up cargo with a helicopter, ferrying around works to work sites to improve the terminal.  There's even more but I haven\u2019t got to it yet. \n\nAll in all I'd say 8.5 out of 10\nDuring a time when it seems like most of what you find are overblown tech demos, or repetition of decent idea (Do we really need another Zombie wave fighter?)  Final Approach manages to stand out as full bodied product and even if you don't have a special interest in aviation this game is well worth checking out.\n", "timestamp_created": 1468567224, "timestamp_updated": 1468567224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502982", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24305200": {"recommendationid": "24305200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001948826", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468995692}, "language": "english", "review": "My only issue with this game is i spent a lot of time bent over and it hurts my back after a while.

When it's bad, you might break something in frustration.\n\nFirst, I'll forewarn by saying... I only wrote this when I ran into something I could complain about.\n\nIn the beginning, this is a casual puzzler with a lot of mini-game objectives. It's downright pleasant to sweep along and draw lines to the different runways. In fact, it feels a lot like playing with an active airplane miniature set. Fantastic! Putting out planes on fire. (Which should be alarming how often that happens.) To clearing birds off the runway. To even guiding planes to embark and disembark. Although, I could deal without baggage handling... I ran into a spat of bad luck and the randomization ran me 20 bags without the one I needed and there were only three colors to choose from.\n\nSuddenly, they make you shoot things... a lot. With just that have poor AI guidance, to boot. When I target an \"objective\" and it doesn't shoot on it's own when I use another plane to target another \"objective\"? Or, the turrets you put in place for one mission don't shoot all the time... and your poor little F16 who can barely turn in the airspace with six hovering opponents?\n\nRocket lock on. C'mon! Picking up bad guys off the ground with a helicopter that doesn't \"pivot\" it swings wide like someone who doesn't know how to park a truck. Pop! Another helicopter down. And when my jet decides to run off and die without my guidance? And I still get docked for bad AI? Grrr... This becomes a lesson in gameplay testing. Srsly.\n\nThen... knocking missiles out of the sky? You ram them with another plane. Easy peasy. There's no other way to take them out because they have hella armor, apparently. So, sacrifice is key. (Take one for the team, pilot!)\n\nWhat I'm trying to say... difficulty doesn't \"scale\" it spikes like a angry jock... and you'll find yourself sweating over some damn fires on a rooftop while \"bad guys\" are shooting up your world. After the 15 mission, I felt like someone got lazy in the story mode. There really is barely any difference from three star ratings to failing the mission.\n\nStill, the good is very good in this game.

It makes me feel like a kid again, playing with some sort of magical airplane playset from the future!\n\nThe controls are intuitive, and the gameplay has more depth to it than it might seem at first. It's one of the few current VR titles that I'm enjoying for the gameplay, as well as the novelty factor. \n\nThere's a really nice feature to scale the play-area independently of the SteamVR room settings, which is a GREAT touch. This means that you can shrink the world to make it easier to move around & lift or drop the floor height so you can play comfortably.\n\nThere are a couple of minor grumbles: the voice-overs get annoyingly repetitive very quickly, as do the break-out interactions like putting out fires & scaring away birds. \n\nOtherwise, it's a fantastic game into which the developers have clearly put a lot of love & attention.

Perhaps a warning (at the very least, in the tutorial) displaying when you draw a path too sharp would help people get an idea of what kind of turning angles they can pull off.\n[*]Free Mode stages don't unlock until you play in each environment for the first time, but challenge levels are all unlocked after playing the tutorial only. Not sure if this was intended or not.\n[*]Scaring off gulls becomes too easy, as they always appear in the same exact locations. It only takes a few times until you know exactly where you need to aim your air horn, making the task take easily under 2 seconds. This kind of makes it not much of a task at all, certainly no challenge. Perhaps make the seagulls spawn in random locations, or maybe in different group sizes. (Small group of 3 birds fly away quickly, large groups of 7-10 gulls take some more noise to scare off.)", "timestamp_created": 1465471108, "timestamp_updated": 1465471211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497506", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23451775": {"recommendationid": "23451775", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977892146", "num_games_owned": 1199, "num_reviews": 117, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465344845}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is quite fun, but you have to spend a while adjusting the Vive's headset to be able to reliably look down.

It is like being in a toddler's dream. You draw flight paths for planes, send them to their hangars, rescue car crash victims with helicopters, and even shrink down to normal size to put out fires, scare away birds, and do some electric maintanence. \n\nIt really is magical to see tiny little planes flying around your head and bend down to look at people on the runway.

You're always leaning over and after a while, your back isn't exactly enjoying itself.\n\nA possible fix to that would be to have the airport raised like on a table. If you've tried Valves Bow and Arrow demo and the Castle miniature you get a good understanding of what i mean. For example a living room with a big table and on that table sits the \"playset\" (would fit in with the feeling of \"playing with Micro Machines\")\nThat way, your back won't hurt after a while and you enjoy the game more. If the Devs would include that as an option I'd be very thankfull.\n\nGripe #2:\nThe frequency of \"sh*t goes wrong\" - now I get you want the game to be a challenge but I just felt like I'm doing nothing BUT shooing away seagulls and extinguising fires. That may be down to the fact that i'm not a great player at this or something but I would appreciated a more \"relaxed\" mode. In my opinion it was just \"too much\" and I ended up not enjoying the game anymore and just exiting - which is a shame because, as I said, I really enjoy the Idea behind the game.\n\nSo if those two gripes were to be adressed in later patches, I'd definitely change my recommendation for that game.\n\nAs it stands, the way it is now and from my point of view I would not recommend it, although your view may differ and perhaps you don't mind the two gripes I've mentioned.\n\n-Gextroll signing off. o7", "timestamp_created": 1462875506, "timestamp_updated": 1467628699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1463065793, "developer_response": "Thanks for playing and leaving your feedback.

We can definitely see how this could get repetitive for some players, especially in early levels. This is something we want to balance in future updates by adding variety to these tasks and optimizing the frequency of these tasks occurring. \n\n\nWe hope to add more of what you're looking for in regards to #2 in upcoming updates, so please look out for those!

You're doing far more than simply landing planes, you also need to take them off too, which requires you to pay attention and make sure there's a clear run. Different planes also have different requirements, passenger planes need to be taken to the terminal before they can take off again and military planes need to go to the military hanger before take-off. There's also things like emergencies that require you to personally extinguish a burning plane or simply help out with luggage sorting. \n\nIn later stages, you do more than just land planes.

This game is so much better than what I was expecting. The detail, my gosh, the detail. I was blown away by the opening screen, even. The menus are gorgeous and perfect for VR, the planes look amazing, and there is a surprising amount of variety in the gameplay. \n\nThis game is SO MUCH MORE than simply drawing flight routes for planes to land (a-la Air Control for mobile platform). That's what I was expecting, and it's there, but oh my, it's only a tiny part. This is a perfect example of a game that doesn't convey it's beauty from demo vids or pictures. Maybe consider releasing a short demo of the first mission? I bought this because it looked interesting, the dev seemed really nice from interviews before Vive release, and I really appreciated their communication about the initial sticker shock and subsequent price drop. \n\nHad I known the game was this polished, with so much variety, I would not have cared about the aforementioned reasons for the purchase. This game is a blast, plain and simple. Can't wait to get out of work so I can get back to it! \n\nLove planes? You'll probably really enjoy Final Approach.

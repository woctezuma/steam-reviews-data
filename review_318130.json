One of the only ones that caught my interest was Doom and Destiny which I got for free. During my playthrough I found it also was on Steam. My response: SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!\n\nStory:\nFour guys just arrived to their friends house to play some D&D when a kingdom summons  them to defeat a dark evil before some plans he may or may not be plotting. Now they go on an adventure to find a way home  in a world filled with jokes, cameos, references and killer chickens.\nWhile the characters aren't anything special, I found the story and world very interesting. Like Undertale, it embraces all the cliches and tropes of RPG's with jokes from various sources like Final Fantasy and Legend of Zelda. It's also pretty funny with a few jokes that made me laugh out loud and while I didn't get every reference, I still enjoy  comedy and viewing this game's story as a comedy is the best way to enjoy it.\n\nGameplay:\nThe battle system is simple but hard and fair where you control a mage, a knight, a ninja and a pirate with healing powers. It's turn based and depending on your moves will determine who'll go next and the timeline can help you decide on you're next target or what to use on them to slow them down. As for abilities, first you need to buy them and then use PP to equip them, which you get by filling out your attributes as you gain levels. Nothing to hard but the enemies, even early on, can do some decent damage. \nThis game also encourages you to grind and look for secrets because you'll need the money to buy weapons and powers and you can do sidequests by killing enemies to get some good gear or items. This leads to biggest praise is how big this world is. Sure, you can head straight to the dungeon where you have to go while buying some gear, OR you could buy a candle and go to the church, go to the towns  to decide what to buy, go to the mines, grind some enemies or look for the secrets in the starting town, all within the first few hours of the game. And after the final boss, is the game over? Nope. In fact the game has only opened up even more once you buy some transportation so you can upgrade your powers, get the best gear and fight the superbosses, which I beat except for the super secret one. My opinion, the three dragons in the dragon nest were the hardest for me.\n\nPresentation:\nFrom what I found out about this game and the fact this is RPG Maker, most of the graphics(except for the main party and a few portraits) are from the maker itself and from I read, the music is also not original. Those it make it bad. Oh god no. The assets were put to good use, giving nice details to every location and the music fits the areas your in. And I like how in battle, the sprites are basically the overworld sprites. So much detail.\n\nVerdict:\nIf you want a good game for your phone, this would be a fun RPG to play on the go.

K\u00e4mpfe werden durch Randomencounter ausgel\u00f6st \n(Gegner sind auf der Karte unsichtbar, man wird beim Herumlaufen in K\u00e4mpfe verwickelt)\nund laufen Rundenweise ab. Oben rechts im Kampfbildschirm wird die Zugreihenfolge angezeigt, die sich duch unterschiedliche Aktionen wie das Verwenden von Techniken, benutzen von items und normalen Angriffen beeinflussen l\u00e4sst. Erw\u00e4hnenswert ist hier, dass einige Techniken den Gegner in der Zugreihenfolge nach hinten verdr\u00e4ngen k\u00f6nnen und wieder andere den Anwender sp\u00e4ter erneut zum Zug kommen lassen. Ebenfalls integriert ist ein \"Aggrosystem\", das Gegner den Helden angreifen l\u00e4sst, de rbesonders viel Schaden verursacht oder Heilung spendet. Eben so gibt es Angriffe, die mehr Aggro aufbauen und wieder welche, die keine aufbauen.\n\nBei einem Level-Up erh\u00e4lt ein Charakter 3 Statuspunkte, die er frei auf die vier Grundfertigkeiten verteilen kann, welche jede f\u00fcr sich zwei Statuswerte beinflussen. Wenn man genug in eine Grundfertigkeit investiert hat, bekommt der Charakter einen Skillpunkt, der Platz f\u00fcr anlegbare Fertigkeiten liefert. Charaktere lernen diese nicht wie \u00fcblich beim Aufleveln, sondern sie m\u00fcssen bei Ausbildern gekauft werden und nehmen je nach St\u00e4rke einen oder zwei Skillpunkte in Beschlag. Fertikgeiten k\u00f6nnen nach Erwerb beliebig an und abgelegt werden.\n\n[h1]Humor[/h1]\nDer Humor zielt darauf ab, RPG Klischees auf die Schippe zu nehmen. Einige Filme und bekannte Spieleklassiker wie Super Mario und Zelda bekommen auch ihr Fett weg.

It's really great on any field: nothing is left to chance, everything is studied and has its own right place in the game's own world.\nIt's something that has been worked on for much time, and it's so

Su Android ci ho giocato e rigiocato per circa un centinaio di ore, e comprando questo titolo in saldo sono sinceramente gasato. Davvero divertente per quanto riguarda l'humor e la costruzione dei personaggi, e fresco e rilassante per quanto riguarda il GamePlay. Uniche piccole pecche, a mio parere, son la mancanza di un sistema per giocare in coop con gli amici (sia online che in locale) che lo distinguerebbe NETTAMENTE dagli altri GDR del genere; ed infine bisognerebbe poter velocizzare poco poco di piu' ogni dialogo (per chi lo vuole rigiocare senza fargli subire tutti i dialoghi).\nComunque il gioco \u00e8 senz'altro sopra la media, anzi merita moltissimo.

Gr\u00e1ficos simples mas bem feitos. \n\n2) Boa trilha sonora. \n\n3) Conversa\u00e7\u00e3o bem c\u00f4mica e divertida. \n\n4) Bom sistema de lutas.  \n\n5) Boa cole\u00e7\u00e3o de  equipamentos, itens e magias. \n\n6) Bons cen\u00e1rios de mundo aberto.\n\n\n\nContras:\n\n1) A hist\u00f3ria por enquanto n\u00e3o impressiona, mas s\u00f3 joguei 3 horas de jogo, ainda tem muita coisa pela frente. \n\n2) O problema \u00e9 que o personagem n\u00e3o anda na diagonal (s\u00f3 anda para frente ou para tr\u00e1s), e isso \u00e9 bem irritante, mas todos os jogos de RPG em 2D t\u00eam essa caracter\u00edstica. \n\n3) Paguei R$ 10 por ele na promo\u00e7\u00e3o, achei um pouco caro pela simplicidade do jogo e pelo fato dele ser gratuito no celular, mas ainda assim acho que vale a pena o pre\u00e7o. \n\n\nNota 8/10.\n\n\nComprei principalmente por causa dos reviews positivos do jogo, \u00e9 raro um jogo conseguir 96% de aprova\u00e7\u00e3o, ainda mais um jogo estilo retro como esse.",

(But at least they are clearly marked with heart symbols.)\n- \"Rations\" system that automatically restores HP & MP after combat is nice.\n- Fast combat option is nice, (speeds things up slightly), but speeding up the animations as well would have been even better.\n- Too many NPC's for my taste, but this is a matter of personal preference I'm sure.", "timestamp_created": 1483922884, "timestamp_updated": 1483922884, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491241", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29126703": {"recommendationid": "29126703", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974414108", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483916500}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun jrpg.

I was a bit put off by the developer constantly adding \"please review this game\" NPCs in EVERY SINGLE TOWN. It's like I'll review it when I damn well feel like it. You really don't need to badger the player to review your game while playing your game, especially if you actually paid for the game. It really left a bad taste in my mouth and its wholly unnecessary.\n\nGetting past that this game is fun. The developer definitely made use of all the RPG Maker sprites and the writing was decent. I like it when a gmae doesn't take itself too seriously. I also enjoyed a few of those \"did you know?\" random facts littered around the first town. Characters are pretty shallow and honestly I just remember them as red, blue, green and yellow. It was chock full of crass humor, game and anime references.\n\nSurprisingly the story was good. Even with the all the different little quests along the way it never deviated from the focus of the group finding their missing friend and returning home. I was actually surprised about all the references made from a Mario-esque inspired landscape to a quest straight out of Dragonball Z. It\u2019s quite a creative and fun use of RPG Maker that I haven\u2019t seen in any of the multitude of games. \n\nFinishing the main story isn\u2019t too difficult on normal setting. There are quite a lot of adventures to be had after completing the game. That\u2019s when the difficulty ramps up and the game becomes a challenge. I\u2019m still trying to complete the last couple of quests and there\u2019s many places you don\u2019t get to explore until after you finish the main story.

Allerdings ist ihr Gamemaster nirgendwo aufzufinden und so machen sie sich auf den Weg ihn zu suchen. Aus heiterem Himmel finden sie sich in einer Fantasy Welt wieder, die von Imperator Destiny regiert wird und von einem dunklen Schatten bedroht wird.\nWie k\u00f6nnte es anders sein ist die \"heilige Mission\" nun das K\u00f6nigreich zu retten und \"wahre Helden\" zu werden, damit unsere Nerds endlich nach Hause k\u00f6nnen.\n\nDas Gameplay:\nIm Grunde ist es relativ einfach. Man steuert einen der Protagonisten, und die anderen drei folgen ihm im G\u00e4nsemarsch ;)\nMan spricht random Leute an, kann bei Lehrmeistern neue Skillz f\u00fcr Golz freischalten und neue Ausr\u00fcstung in Shops zu kaufen. Dabei bewegt man sich zwischen den einzelnen D\u00f6rfern und St\u00e4dten \u00fcber die riesige Weltkarte, \u00e4hnlich wie bei vielen anderen RPGs aus der Vogelperspektive. Zwischendrin begegnet man, je nach Gegend zuf\u00e4lligen Gegnergruppen und \"klatscht\" den ein oder anderen Boss um. Mit jedem Level kann man Punkte verteilen und so die Eigenschaften der Nerds erh\u00f6hen und weitere SPs f\u00fcr F\u00e4higkeiten freischalten.\n\nDas Beste!:\n\u00dcberall und an jeder Ecke wimmelt es vor Andeutungen und Parodien auf die Welt aus Film, Spiel und Manga/Anime.\nZum Beispiel gibt es einen Kapitelabschnitt der an Final Fantasy erinnert, ein anderer bedient sich Elementen von Dragon Ball und Pokemon. Dies sei genug um den potentiellen K\u00e4ufern den Spa\u00df nicht zu verderben ;) ...\n\nDas Schlechte:\nNichts desto trotz rate ich Spielern mit niedriger Frust rate und wenig Geduld vom Kauf ab. Es ist zwar wirklich cool, aber man \"muss\" hin und wieder mit simplen Grinden und trainieren verbringen bzw. die ein oder andere Niederlage z\u00e4hneknirschend akzeptieren und es noch einmal versuchen.\n\nDas Fazit:\nUnd dennoch empfehle ich jedem hei\u00dfbl\u00fctigen Fan von JRPGs und anderen Rollenspielen sich Doom & Destiny zu geben. Es lohnt sich wirklich ;) ... und auch der Preis von 10 M\u00fccken bzw. 4 oder 5 mit Reduzierung ist es alle mal Wert ;)", "timestamp_created": 1451343910, "timestamp_updated": 1451343910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20031892": {"recommendationid": "20031892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053175166", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451458405}, "language": "english", "review": "not bad. olds chool parody. not, like, the best thing ever but if you wanna play an old school FF agme without actually replaying an old school FF game, its a pretty good choice.", "timestamp_created": 1451306640, "timestamp_updated": 1451306640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20029306": {"recommendationid": "20029306", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127836730", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489834527}, "language": "italian", "review": "Fanastico", "timestamp_created": 1451300319, "timestamp_updated": 1451300319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20017582": {"recommendationid": "20017582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188489397", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481938598}, "language": "english", "review": "this game kinda funny", "timestamp_created": 1451266546, "timestamp_updated": 1451266546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469613", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20014303": {"recommendationid": "20014303", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970570841", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476551451}, "language": "english", "review": "nice old school action RPG", "timestamp_created": 1451258369, "timestamp_updated": 1451258369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19980818": {"recommendationid": "19980818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032347130", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452327388}, "language": "english", "review": "Nostalgic fun and funny!", "timestamp_created": 1451179037, "timestamp_updated": 1451179037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19973084": {"recommendationid": "19973084", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973888181", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451687471}, "language": "english", "review": "GG", "timestamp_created": 1451162320, "timestamp_updated": 1451162320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19918926": {"recommendationid": "19918926", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969583104", "num_games_owned": 409, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452126188}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game!

Vale molto di pi\u00f9 di quanto costa, senza contare che gli sviluppatori sono italiani e sono riusciti a realizzare quello che \u00e8 uno dei miei sogni di sempre: pubblicare un BEL gioco fatto con rpg maker!\n\nL'ho finito su Windows Phone la prima volta (il miglior gioco del windows store, anzi, direi l'unico che vale la pena giocare) e l'ho finito altre 2 volte su Steam, dopo averlo comprato una terza volta anche sullo store di Windows 8.

The green ring upgrade course was something I hadn't seen done before.\n-The party leader system and its stat changes were novel and a nice addition.\n-The power/spell/ability system restricted what tools you could use and added an interesting layer of complexity.\n-The creativity of some of the secret areas was enjoyable. The landscape textures being a subtle arrow pointing at a hidden door sticks in the mind.\n-Status effects work on bosses and MP damage can solve a fight or two. Both are refreshing changes from the norm.\n\nA negative\n-Some parts can be frustrating to figure out. I had 3, 2 of which I resorted to the net to navigate through but 1 of those was me being forgetful.\n\n\nQuestionable\n\n-The plot itself is enjoyable but a number of twists can be easily seen coming. So easliy in fact and due to the nature of the game's writing I can't decide if they were actually meant to be running jokes and not twists.\n\n-There are characters scattered about (and marked) that ask you to post reviews on steam and comments of somesort on facebook. I don't know if you're rewarded for doing so as I had no intention of writing a review until I had actually beaten the game. This made these NPCs slightly annoying whenever they popped up but since they were marked out it wasn't terrible. Their addition probably encouraged me to write a review after I was done with it but their 3 options of \"Link to Steam Review\", \"Link to Facebook\", and \"I am a stupid meanie head\" was not endearing. A simple request/reminder without the aggression in the dialogue to end the conversation would have been enough.\n\n\nIt should be mentioned what when the game says \"Alt + Enter for full screen\" it's refering to left Alt. Similar to the encouter autofight button which is left Ctrl. I mention this incase you want to build a script to help you farm pirate keys late game.

Combat variety is also very scarce.

But here we go.\n\nDoom & Destiny is a turn based RPG that basically jokes about/steriotypes Tabletop RPGs as well as the \"nerdy/geeky\" lifestyle in a sense. It is very humorous, almost everything about this game will make you laugh if you understand it.\nSo here is a short list of pros and cons to this game.\n\nPros-\n\nGraphics, this is a \"if you like these kind of graphics\" thing. Personally, the graphics are nice, bringing back memories of some of the classic pixelly RPGs of old.\n\nAudio/Music, the music and audio are nice. Not really sure how else I should explain this... So there you go :-)\n\nCombat, the combat is turn based, which I definitely like. Skills/Powers and there uses actually matter, the proper timing of a skill could really determine whether you end the battle in victory or in defeat. Strategy actually matters!\n\nSkills/Powers, there are a lot of them! Plus, you get to choose basically any of them you want! In the game, you basically purchase your skills and give them to the characters, each character being able to equip a certain number of skills.\n\nCharacter Development, you are basically able to shape the characters however you want. Although the characters have a class that they are given initially, the terms of what these will become is vary vague, and up to your personal interpretation. Want a Ranger? Make one. Want a Paladin? Make one. Want Kirito from SAO? Make him!\n\nAlright, that is enough pros I think except from some more minor things, so lets continue with the cons.\n\nCons-\n\nIf you don't like \"RPG Maker Games\" or their like, then you probably won't like this one either. But let me just say, this is not your \"cheap made RPG maker game\", this is a milestone for games like this and it should not even be remotely compared to some of the other RPG maker titles currently on Steam.\n\nCombat, but didn't I have combat in pros? Well, I like the combat, but it seems like others do not like it so much. Like some turn based games, the combat may feel slow at points or feel repetative. This leads to the next point...\n\nGrinding, expect to grind some if you want to level your characters. Although for the most part you can just do quests and keep the action moving, you will need to do some actual leveling in order to proceed. Personally I have nothing wrong with experience hunting, but I understand that others do not like this so much usually, so I thought I would point this out.\n\nConclusion-\n\nDoom & Destiny is definitely a game that is worth the money, if not for the gameplay (which itself is amazing), then for the comical aspect of it. It is definitely a unique game like nothing else I have seen previous. You should definitely get this if you want to play a fun, casual game with lots of humor.\n\nMay your adventures be many and always end in reward!\n-Donoknight, Founder of the Tabletop RPG Gamers League", "timestamp_created": 1437517372, "timestamp_updated": 1437517756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17139798": {"recommendationid": "17139798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010278393", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437466791}, "language": "english", "review": "\"first afro-american mage\" .... let the hillarity begin!!!", "timestamp_created": 1437396699, "timestamp_updated": 1437396699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17136487": {"recommendationid": "17136487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080878825", "num_games_owned": 1079, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439658145}, "language": "english", "review": "Entertaining game.", "timestamp_created": 1437376697, "timestamp_updated": 1437376697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17120135": {"recommendationid": "17120135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038552111", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 2177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435248245}, "language": "english", "review": "Love those type of games, hope part 2 will be translated into german.", "timestamp_created": 1437291565, "timestamp_updated": 1437291565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502475", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17111367": {"recommendationid": "17111367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000831809", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437529580}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is suprisingly fun.", "timestamp_created": 1437243046, "timestamp_updated": 1437243046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17076228": {"recommendationid": "17076228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040647186", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1070, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448878233}, "language": "english", "review": "VERY ENJOYABLE", "timestamp_created": 1437055237, "timestamp_updated": 1437055237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17070626": {"recommendationid": "17070626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008108803", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487736740}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely one of the best games i've played in a very long time it keeps you amused and keeps you wanting to play more, Flying spaghetti monster.....?

I didnt and pushed all  of my characters strength stats at the expense of others. Thats my prefered style ,I dont like relying on magic as your supply of it can exhaust somewhere deep in-field leaving your party screwed. Good armor and weapons and lots of strength to back them up is more reliable imo.\n However my opinion is in error as far as this game goes. My crew was pushing level 20 and was heavy with health restoring items when I was pushed into a fight where I was heavily out numbered and largely outclassed. If I had just invested in developing some attack magic with area effects as well as some support magic I would have come out on top .As it is its a permanent stalemate. My last save point was in the Elf village that was under attack so I cant sneak back into the world to spend a few more hours prepping my crew for the Mario World. Im stuck and can never advance the plot with my current game. If only this game would have included hard point save areas that a player could fall back.\nOh well , Ill try again some day.\n This IS a fun old school rpg with some profanity and pretty funny dialouge but one thing:I cant tell if the dialouge grammer is intentionally bad or if its deliberately designed to spoof the translation foibles that are inherent in Japanese-to-English translations.\n The music and sound fx are not really to my liking but thats okay as the option screen lets me turn them off outright.\nI like this game and am glad I bought it", "timestamp_created": 1429808927, "timestamp_updated": 1429808927, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15495017": {"recommendationid": "15495017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198174317233", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1732, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498940421}, "language": "italian", "review": "Pls", "timestamp_created": 1429731782, "timestamp_updated": 1429731782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15488019": {"recommendationid": "15488019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075252489", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430839182}, "language": "english", "review": "One word.

From the moment the game starts it delves into the meta and lampooning everything you loved about RPGs. Now you can expect the standard helping of RPGMaker Pixel graphics, turn based combat, hundreds of items/spells and huge overworld to explore. What makes Doom & Destiny rise above the rest, is its dialogue and characters. Why are they on this crazy adventure? Who cares. Just have fun is the mentality, and It shows.

Dragon Quest series recently. I tried a few JRPG's on Steam that just weren't doing it for me and came across Doom & Destiny while browsing the RPG section and decided to buy it on a whim. It was one of my best impulse buys in a while. \n\nD&D was exactly what I was looking for in an old-school exploration/grinding RPG and on top of giving me the experience I wanted, it also made me laugh along the way. Now, the humor relies heavily on the assumption that the player has a lot of experience with the RPG genre, but I assume if you're interested in this type of game, then chances are you are quite familiar with the games that it lampoons. \n\nAside from being funny, the gameplay is pretty solid. There's a certain amount of customization that goes into leveling your characters and deciding which powers you want them to equip.

You're walking along a passageway, and all of a sudden your down arrow is scrolling at breakneck speed down the combat menu. There's no animation, no alert for \"hey, you're gonna fight some enemies now\", just a nasty surprise when you just wanted to take four steps without having to jolt yourself out of the moment of fun you might have been having to hold the Left Ctrl key and power blast through the combat without making a single tactical decision.\n\nOverall, poorly written, poorly designed, and above all, just not enjoyable to play.", "timestamp_created": 1427167978, "timestamp_updated": 1427167978, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.362007", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15026966": {"recommendationid": "15026966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058086367", "num_games_owned": 616, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427285290}, "language": "italian", "review": "Il miglior Indie GDR mai creato. finito su Windows Phone, rigiocato su pc con versione fisica comprata al Lucca comics e ora di nuovo rigiocato qui su steam, epico e intramontabile", "timestamp_created": 1427153085, "timestamp_updated": 1427153085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525120", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15025394": {"recommendationid": "15025394", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000123266", "num_games_owned": 565, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 994, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427236974}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good for an rpgmaker game.

time.\n\nThe game plays like a traditional RPG with some smart twists, and the main selling point is the story, compelling and full of good humor and countless jokes on pop culture tropes. Maybe, just maybe it gets a litte worse in the very last part, but as a whole it is great. \n\nThe characters are all funny and interesting, except Nigel: everybody hates Nigel. \n\nAs a quick note on Gameplay: I usually don't like JRPG \" \u00e0 la\" Final Fantasy. I hate mindless turn combat and really, really  hate random encounters and grinding, but this game was a nice change of pace: the initiative management and the aggro system make everything more interesting, and the \"speed-up\" button is a blessing to quickly resolve easy random encounter when you backtrack to older part of the map.\n\nRecommended!", "timestamp_created": 1426697940, "timestamp_updated": 1426697940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665645", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14948601": {"recommendationid": "14948601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041753179", "num_games_owned": 516, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481896019}, "language": "english", "review": "ENGLISH REVIEW: \n\nDnd is a game about four friends mistakenly summoned in a world of magic and believed\nto be heroes. In reality they're a bunch of nerds trying to return to their homes while they\nenjoy a wonderful adventure in a fantasy land filled with treasures, castles, dragons, orcs,\nelves and... Santa Claus.\n\nThe first thing I thought about Doom and Destiny was \"here's another rpg maker game that\nis trying to be a parody of other famous rpgs like final fantasy\"... And I was right, the\ngame is just this, but done well... very well. \n\nThe humor is very captivating and the jokes will make you laugh in more than one occasion. And don't think the story doesn't take itself seriously at all, because it does, delivering a fascinating story without \"plot holes\" even though it's a parody.\n\nI dare to say Doom and Destiny is a perfect blend of storytelling and great humor, with a gameplay on par with titles from the final fantasy series and the possibility of exploring the world, which is something that similar games don't do anymore. And secrets, lots of secrets scattered through the map and in the numerous locations of the game.\n\nAlso the game has 3 difficulty settings so it can be played by everyone.\n\nBoth the music and the graphics are licensed contents, they weren't made by the developers but bought from third parties and put into the game. I don't consider this a real flaw, but I know some people stay away from games with rpg maker graphics because they think they're not worth it... Well, if you can get over the fact that the graphics is standard rpg maker, I assure you'll find a real gem.\n\nIf you played \"the Bridge\", a very good puzzle game here on Steam, you'll notice that the game opening music is the same of Doom and Destiny, but does this make The Bridge a bad game only because they share the same opening song? no, so don't be discouraged by these things someone could call \"flaws\" and give this game a chance. You'll not regret it.\n\n\nRECENSIONE ITA:\n\nDnd \u00e8 un gioco che racconta di quattro amici evocati per sbaglio in una terra magica e scambiati per eroi. In realt\u00e0 sono quattro nerdacci della peggior specie che cercano un modo per tornare a casa, ma non prima di essersi gustati una fantastica avventura in un mondo pieno di tesori, castelli, draghi, orchi, elfi e... Babbo Natale.\n\nLa prima cosa che ho pensato di Dnd \u00e8 stata \"ecco un altro gioco fatto con Rpg Maker che cerca di fare la parodia di altri famosi rpg come Final Fantasy\"... e avevo ragione, il gioco \u00e8 essenzialmente questo, ma fatto bene... davvero bene.\n\nL'humor \u00e8 accattivante e le battute ti faranno ridere in pi\u00f9 di un'occasione. E non pensiate che la storia non si prende sul serio nemmeno un po', perch\u00e9 lo fa, regalando una trama affascinante senza \"plot holes\", e questo \u00e8 gi\u00e0 tanto essendo una parodia.\n\nMi permetto di affermare che Dnd \u00e8 una perfetta miscela di storia e umorismo, con un gameplay al pari di titoli della serie Final Fantasy e la possibilit\u00e0 di esplorare il mondo di gioco, qualcosa che non si vede pi\u00f9 tanto spesso in questo tipo di giochi... e segreti, tantissimi segreti sparsi per la mappa e nelle numerose aree del gioco. Inoltre il gioco ha 3 livelli di difficolt\u00e0, cos\u00ec da poter essere giocato da tutti.\n\nSia la musica che la grafica sono contenuti acquistati da terze parti e concesse dietro licenza. Personalmente non considero questo un vero difetto, ma so che molta gente si tiene alla larga dai giochi con grafica Rpg maker perch\u00e8 pensa manchino di originalit\u00e0... ebbene, se riuscirete a guardare oltre le grafiche di rpg maker vi assicuro che vi ritroverete di fronte ad una vera perla del genere ricolmo di originalit\u00e0 ed estro creativo.\n\nSe avete giocato \"The Bridge\", un buon puzzle game qui su Steam, noterete che la musica di apertura \u00e8 la stessa di Dnd, perch\u00e9 acquistata dallo stesso musicista; ma questo rende forse \"The Bridge\" un brutto gioco? non credo, quindi non fatevi scoraggiare da queste limitazioni del titolo e date una chance ad un grande gioco; non ve ne pentirete.\n", "timestamp_created": 1426697353, "timestamp_updated": 1426697353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 88, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750959", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14948521": {"recommendationid": "14948521", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998499511", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476361235}, "language": "italian", "review": "This game simply changed my life.\n\n10/10 would play it again until being fired from work by my boss.", "timestamp_created": 1426696944, "timestamp_updated": 1426719288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547459", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39330857": {"recommendationid": "39330857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198394215176", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 82, "last_played": 1515913801}, "language": "schinese", "review": "hao wan", "timestamp_created": 1515913456, "timestamp_updated": 1515913456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39319125": {"recommendationid": "39319125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000326278", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 11522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5325, "last_played": 1515852990}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't expect great graphics.\nDon't expect fancy animation.\nDon't expect a serious game.\n\nDo expect an RPG listed as one of the best in Steam.\nDo expect some lighthearted humor.\nDo expect unexpected jokes and references.\n\nThere's a reason so many found it worth paying for - specially on sale.\nGreat game!\nPraise the flying spaghetti monster!\n\nP.S.: you may need to grind a little if you play on hardcore", "timestamp_created": 1515874383, "timestamp_updated": 1515874383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39290870": {"recommendationid": "39290870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255962725", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1557, "last_played": 1516193229}, "language": "italian", "review": "Adoro questo gioco.

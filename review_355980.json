It has some neat extras, such as unlockable traps, and a trap levelling progression. Beat previous levels with added difficulty and gain more experience, which makes future levels easier. All that said, this is truly a TOWER DEFENSE GAME with all the feel of placing towers and zapping the horde of marching toward the door. Don't expect the game play to go much farther than the original gameplay. In fact, it feels like less than the original, because most of the equipment is unlocked through grinding levels. Many hours are spent with the same scant few towers being used over and over, while you try to beat more advanced levels for typical equipment. Yet, for the low cost, there is plenty to like here, and I have spent many hours working out better strategies for the levels, but I also wish it was delivering more of the later game play a bit sooner.\n\nI have always had a mischevious spot for dungeon traps, and I had this crazy book in my RPG days filled with all sorts of clever traps for killing characters. This game scratches that itch to a degree, but I kind of wish it hit the mark with a bit more oomph. I think the designers should have realized that there was a lot more fun pushing a mob down a bottomless pit than shooting it a million times with an arrow trap.

You can always go back later and replay any level with more upgrades/ unlocks.\n\nSome design choices that make me appreciate this game more than most.\n+Calling waves early gives 50 gold bonus regardless of time so doesn't push you hit next wave as soon as it appears every time for maximum bonus.\n+There is no mechanic that leads you to hoard gold. You get it you spend it.\n+The upgrade system doesn't tie you down into using specific towers. It's more tied to progression and XP where you can change around your tower upgrades every map.\n\n---There are flying enemies in the game.\n-8 difficulty modifiers is a decent selection but more would certianly be nice.\n-The way endless mode is set up many of the towers become entirely useless to have in your loadout.\n-Some of the towers quickly feel inferior to towers you get later in the game, especially on later levels.

Somehow that physics engine makes those dungeon feel more alive, when it get's very crowded and massive amounts of enemies are pushed over the edge, it's awesome.\n\nWhile it's very fun, it also feels well balanced and upgrades are well done. Using various \"mutators\" to reply the levels with added difficulties opens whole new field to replying old levels (for example, you can add one that gives you just one health instead of 20, or adds health/regeneration to enemies, etc - those will give you experience multipliers, so adding more can make it crazy hard but also give insane exp). So you can develope interesting combinations/strategies for earning extra experience needed to boost your defenses even more. \n\nAlso, various consumables (traps you put on certain spots \"on the fly\", and wait for the timer to reset so you can place some more) make it more dynamic, and adds yet another layer to possible strategies, as you can choose only one type of consumable for a given battle.\n\nBut honestly, just see this game on youtube if you are not sold already.

If you \"beat\" the game most likely you'll be able to obtain most of the achievements without having to spend too much time doing so. \nMajority of my play time was just playing the game, I think I spend an additional 2 hours trying to obtain some of the achievements I didn't obtain before \"beating/finishing\" the last level or \"hidden level\".

Instead of towers you have traps, a lot of traps, actually. The rules are simple, enemies are approaching, place traps to destroy them. Get gold by killing them and place new traps. Repeat until a level is finished. When you get lvl up and upgrade your traps or get new ones. When new level starts. As i said, it's classic.\n\nThere were the things I really liked. For example, its really pleasant to see how enemies die :D\nNice visual and sound effects. Also, there are a lot of enemies comes, they gather in group and then a group dies... its awesome feeling. \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1166526091\n\nThere is a lot of everything. There are ground traps, wall traps, hook trap, demon portal which summons units on the path, push trap and etc... so you have unlimited choice of ways to pass every level. You received the experience by passing levels and then you get gems which can be spent on upgrades of towers. It's sad, but they gives small bonuses like -1% cooldown time, but there are a lot of them. I know, some people like systems like this. Also, these upgrades unlocks new upgrade for traps. For example, if you will make 15 upgrade for Spike Trap, it will get 3 upgrades +1 damage /+1 damage and 2 upgrades fro choose, add burning effect on attack twice per activation.\n\nThere is interesting mechanic for setting difficulty. There are 12 tunes in the game, each rune add an feature to the game (enemies get extra health or you have got only 1 live and etc.). If you take rune to the battle, the game becomes harder, but you will receive increased reward, up to 7 times of basic. So, you can change the difficulty of the game whatever you want with such interesting mechanic.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1166764502\n\nThere are also things which I could describe as boring. First of all, the bestiary of enemies is small. I have passed about 15 levels and have met only 7-8 different enemies. There comes an another flow, the design of waves of levels. They are... the same... A bunch of peasants with nobles comes at the first waves. Fast moving thieves com at the 2 or second wave. Then knights with moderate HP and armor appear. At the last wave a lot of Crusaders com, they have large amount of health and heavy armor. So, I after I realized it after ~12 mission, the game become pretty boring for me. Yeah, new traps, units, runes appear... I am an old TD fan, but it wasn't enough for me. \n\nAlso, this game lacks of strategy. There is no special strategy for different enemies. All traps are good against all enemies. So it's possible to pass the mission without any thinking. I don't think it's a good feature for a strategy game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1166526149\n\n[h1]Resume[/h1]\nThis game will be interesting for TD fans. People who like sandboxes and games with not strict goals and ways of their achievement will find this game satisfying. But this freedom brings a lack of diversity between missions. Anyway, the game is worth for a try.

The 2D pixel graphics are serviceable enough as to be able to see what you need to see but very basic, imo. They're not horrible either... Music is fine but there's like 1 or 2 BGM tracks total, which is a shame, because the whole thing has an obvious OMD flair, which, on one hand is quite cheeky, but on the other hand: hey, it works =P\n\nFor the price, this one is very much recommended, specially if you're a fan of TD games. This should prove to be enough of a challenge for TD afficionados, plus due to the aforementioned difficulty system, you'll probably get your money's worth and more in terms of content.\n\nGood job, and very much looking forward to the sequel... hopefully they'll improve as much as possible of the graphics and music front =)", "timestamp_created": 1506805761, "timestamp_updated": 1506805796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534806", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35316083": {"recommendationid": "35316083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300224325", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512033329}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u600e\u4e48\u8bf4\u5462\uff0c\u8fd8\u6bd4\u8f83\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5fd8\u8bb0\u4ece\u90a3\u4e00\u5929\u8d77\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f20\u5730\u56fe\u4e86\uff0c\u5f88\u662f\u5751\u4eba\uff0c\u5076\u5c14\u6302\u8d77\u6765\u73a9\u770b\u89c6\u9891lpl\uff0c\u6253\u6cd5\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u77e5\u4e0d\u89c980\u5c0f\u65f6\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1506728373, "timestamp_updated": 1506728373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35284875": {"recommendationid": "35284875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056174274", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507242369}, "language": "english", "review": "Shut up and surrender your money\n", "timestamp_created": 1506668606, "timestamp_updated": 1506668606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35282330": {"recommendationid": "35282330", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124275446", "num_games_owned": 1310, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 2484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506658358}, "language": "english", "review": "Dungeon Warfare is a fantastic tower defense game that offers uniqueness in the genre and plenty of replay value. As of writing the review, I have unlocked all levels and have beaten the game. It took me approximately forty hours to do so. The value here is immense; going by the $1.00 per hour of gameplay rule, you can expect to get four times or more of your money's worth, considering you buy it for full price.\n\nThis game is somewhat reminiscent of Dungeon Keeper. Your goal is to prevent the good guys from reaching your dungeon portal, and you must use various traps at your disposal (along with rechargeable spells, of which there are many that you may unlock over the course of the game). Keeping true to the genre, strategy is key, for particular traps are more useful in some areas than others. Unlike many tower defense games, many traps are able to be placed on the ground rather than on \"towers\" or walls, such as spikes/slime/grinders, which varies things up quite a bit. Throughout the game, winning one level will unlock up to three more, and each level shows you its layout and what it unlocks upon completion before you even play it. There are over forty levels in the main game, some of which are required to progress, and some of which are optional and grant you gems (required to level up everything; they upgrade your traps, spells, and even how much gold/lives you start out with). Beating a level also unlocks the ability to replay it with runes, reminiscent of the Gemcraft series. Each rune offers a different challenge, such as additional enemy health/speed, and enabling a rune on a level and subsequently beating it offers you an XP multiplier, which helps you level up. Thus, if you ever get stuck on a level, there are multiple options at your disposal to allow you to earn XP to level with and try again.\n\nI am past level 70, and there is no end in sight. Do not expect reachable level caps here. Even once all trap upgrade tiers are unlocked (they can upgrade to level four, granting additional benefits and abilities during the level) you can continue to upgrade them to cost less, trigger more often, etc. You could, technically, play this game forever, and keep upgrading your already powerful traps to become ridiculous.\n\nLevels are varied and interesting, and even the environments change (from excavation/mining areas to tombs to ice levels). There is a level editor to create even more levels, as if the abundance here isn't already more of an offering than most games in the genre. The graphics are endearing and colorful, and the game does not shy away from pixelated gore, a DOS-era voice chiming in after a killstreak to comment, \"Juicy!\" The music here is fantastic. There is an Easter egg of sorts to be found by those of us who are fans of the tower defense genre in later levels, and there is a secret level to be found within the game. I encourage you to find it yourself; if you beat the game without finding it, the ending credits will tell you which level to go back to in order to search for it.\n\nI haven't had this much fun with a tower defense game since Kingdom Rush Frontiers. I spent 40 hours in this game over the course of a week, and I didn't get bored. This will be a game I will revisit in the future, and I highly recommend it to tower defense and strategy fans. Upon beating it I immediately searched for more Valsar games to support, and was disappointed to find none. If the developer releases more games in the future, I will be supporting them for sure.", "timestamp_created": 1506659846, "timestamp_updated": 1506659846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573610", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35253923": {"recommendationid": "35253923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283693524", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509889372}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u6ef4\u4e56\u4e56 \u4e5f\u592a\u597d\u73a9\u4e86\u5427", "timestamp_created": 1506569545, "timestamp_updated": 1506569545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35244460": {"recommendationid": "35244460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326917416", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507286335}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u73a9\u7740\u73a9\u7740\u5c31\u4e0a\u763e\u4e86//\u3002//\u8fd8\u662f\u6709\u70b9\u559c\u6b22\u5854\u9632\u7c7b\u6e38\u620f\uff1a\uff09\n\n\u6211TM\u5c04\u7206//\u6211TM\u7535\u7206//\u3002//\n\n\u753b\u9762\u7c97\u72b7\u50cf\u7d20\u98ce\u683c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\n\n\u628a\u4e00\u7fa4\u5c0f\u602a\u5f39\u4e0b\u53bb\u771f\u597d\u73a9//\u3002//\n\n\u4f11\u95f2\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\u8fd8\u4e0d\u9519ww", "timestamp_created": 1506528201, "timestamp_updated": 1506528201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35219069": {"recommendationid": "35219069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357613630", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507199507}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u95ee\u9898\u5427\uff0c\u5728\u4e8c\u500d\u901f\u4e0b\uff0c\u602a\u7269\u7684\u51b2\u51fb\u529b\u597d\u50cf\u4e5f\u7ffb\u500d\u4e86\uff0c\u5728\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7a81\u56f4\u6709\u98de\u884c\u5668\u90a3\u4e00\u5173\u6700\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u7528\u65e0\u9650\u51b0\u51bb\u6d41\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u6ce2\u7528\u9a91\u58eb\u5835\u4e0a\u8def\u53e3\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u4e4b\u540e\u4e0b\u4e00\u6ce2\u7684\u5c0f\u5077\u5728\u4e00\u500d\u901f\u4e0b\u8fc7\u4e0d\u6765\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u4e8c\u500d\u901f\u4e0b\u5f88\u8f7b\u677e\u5c31\u80fd\u8fc7\u6765\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5728\u6709\u51e0\u5173\u73a9\u65e0\u9650\u51b0\u8fd8\u662f\u6709\u70b9\u8010\u5fc3\u5427\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1506420587, "timestamp_updated": 1506420587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35218643": {"recommendationid": "35218643", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979014076", "num_games_owned": 603, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 3032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512056828}, "language": "english", "review": "This is imho 20 Tower defense i played sorted by interest :\n\n0- (warcraft 3's TD \\o/)\n1- GemCraft - Chasing Shadows\n2- Creeper World 3: Arc Eternal\n3- Defender's Quest : Valley of the Forgotten\n4- Dungeon Warfare\n5- PixelJunk\u2122 Monsters Ultimate\n6- Kingdom Rush\n7- Super Sanctum TD\n8- Defense Grid: The Awakening\n9- Space Run\n10- Terrorhedron\n11- Evil Defenders\n12- Revenge of the Titans\n13- Bloons TD\n14- Garden Rescue Christmas edition\n15- Garden Rescue\n16- Defend Your Life\n17- Tower Wars\n18- OTTTD\n19- Particula\n20- Bloons TD Battle\n\n\nTower defense assimilated games that we cannot forget :)\n\n1- Dungeon of the endless\n2- Orcs must die (1-2)\n3- Sanctum (1-2)\n4- Plants vs Zombies\n", "timestamp_created": 1506418338, "timestamp_updated": 1506418338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630188", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35214013": {"recommendationid": "35214013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010942070", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507046624}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you like Orcs Must Die?

As far as Tower Defense games go I feel it has a reasonable level of difficulty, though some levels \u2013 such as Shallow Grave or The Mountain \u2013 can be pretty brutal if you're unprepared.\n\nEvery trap can serve you well in defending your dungeons, even the humble Dart Trap and Spike Trap you start the game with. By leveling up and using the gems obtained to upgrade your traps, you increase their efficiency \u2013 more damage, faster cooldowns, or lower cost. Mixing and matching your loadouts and set up was half of the fun for me in Dungeon Warfare. The other half admittedly came from playing with physics traps like the Push Trap and Spring Trap, knocking hapless heroes into the abyss or pools of liquid and hearing them shout in dismay before disappearing.\n\nThe game gives you plenty of flexibility in how you approach a level. There'll be pits you can try tossing enemies into, or using Spring/Push traps to launch enemies into spiked walls for an instant kill, and with the varied traps all being fairly balanced and useful, the combinations of traps and upgrades brings quite a bit of variety into how you play. Sometimes replaying the same map under a different loadout can be quite fun.\n\nAfter you've cleared enough levels, you can start using Runes to increase the difficulty, as well as increasing your rewards. This can be a good method of leveling up to be better prepared for later maps like The Mountain.  \n\nEventually you'll want to take a look at the included Map Editor. It's fairly straightforward and easy to grasp, and making your own maps or downloading those made by others further adds to what you can do during your time playing. Making maps of my own and trying to beat them has been a lot of fun as well.\n\nThe music is also fairly nice, especially the opening theme that also sometimes plays during your time defending your dungeons.\n\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed Dungeon Warfare, and its sequel that's on the horizon is looking like it'll be quite amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1502428106, "timestamp_updated": 1502428389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34143034": {"recommendationid": "34143034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198238457432", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512129271}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun game and a bit hard sometimes, worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1502359148, "timestamp_updated": 1511433739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517252", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34129293": {"recommendationid": "34129293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335192823", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501165488}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u63a8\u4eba\u5165\u5751\uff0c\u5176\u4e50\u65e0\u7a77", "timestamp_created": 1502299266, "timestamp_updated": 1502299266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34127294": {"recommendationid": "34127294", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971583799", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505240404}, "language": "german", "review": "Awesome Game!

The game also has consumables, which are essentially spells which do different things.  Place an egg on the ground, that when cracked spawns a minion to attack creeps, or use the midas consumable to turn enemies into gold, stunning them and making them give more gold on death.\n\n\nThe games upgrades are also interesting.  Consumables can be upgraded to gain new effects on use, towers gain cooldown reduction, damage, or many other things.  The final tier of each trap offers a completely unique upgrade to each trap, and that fully upgraded trap can only be used once on the level.  The final level of the slow trap makes the slow trap deal 1 damage per second, which can be used in a chokepoint to conquer levels with ease.  These unique consumables, upgrades and large amount of various traps allow you to play however you essentially want.  \n\nThe game features workshop support (not many levels are actually on the workshop, sadly), runes for each level (make levels harder and get more exp), and a survival gamemode which works on any level.  Last for as long as you can with increasing difficulty, but your limit on max level traps is increased, so more strategies are opened.  \n\n\n\n\nBuy Dungeon Warfare if you are a veteran of tower defenses, or a newcomer to the genre and looking to find a fantastic game.", "timestamp_created": 1501791172, "timestamp_updated": 1501791726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33950101": {"recommendationid": "33950101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198338682760", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506077380}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u6bd4\u770b\u7740\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u60e8\u53eb\u7740\u6389\u4e0b\u6df1\u6e0a\u66f4\u723d\u7684\uff1f\n\u2014\u2014\u770b\u7740\u4e00\u7fa4\u4eba\u60e8\u53eb\u7740\u6389\u4e0b\u6df1\u6e0a\u3002\n\u90a3\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u6bd4\u770b\u7740\u4e00\u7fa4\u4eba\u6389\u4e0b\u6df1\u6e0a\u66f4\u723d\u7684\u5462\uff1f\n\u2014\u2014\u770b\u7740\u4e00\u7fa4\u4eba\u60e8\u53eb\u7740\u88ab\u540c\u4f19\u6324\u4e0b\u6df1\u6e0a\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1501597507, "timestamp_updated": 1501597507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33929845": {"recommendationid": "33929845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015250063", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 814, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500888906}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u723d\u5feb\u7684\u5854\u9632...\u5404\u79cd\u8650\u82f1\u96c4...", "timestamp_created": 1501515451, "timestamp_updated": 1501515451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33880871": {"recommendationid": "33880871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348543439", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 677, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508595055}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f Tower Defense.\n\n\u041f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0438\u043a\u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u044b \u043b\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0448\u0435\u043a, \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438, \u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0443\u044e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0443.\u0411\u0435\u0437\u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0442\u043e\u043f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\n\n10/10 \u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0432 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0432", "timestamp_created": 1501335140, "timestamp_updated": 1501335140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33825426": {"recommendationid": "33825426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128955780", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501298931}, "language": "english", "review": "I've never enjoyed a tower defense game as much as I have enjoyed this one.

These runes also give xp bonuses when you have them equipped, rewarding you for playing a harder mode. The endless mode is enough to keep any one occupied for hours on a single map. The game is also constantly updated, and the developers interact with the community, so yoru voice is always heard.

This is the best Tower Defense game I have ever played! I put off buying it because of the old school chunky graphics ...but let me tell you they work really well for the game and frankly are a lot more fun than super detailed models. There's something extra horrible and hilarious about watching little pixel people being ground into a mulch of red dots by machines. \n\nGameplay is as solid as it gets and it is more addictive than anything else I have ever played.  The music may be repetitive but I really dig and I have been playing for hours straight and I still like it. It really suits the mood and the style. \n\nThis game was an amazing surprise for me.

I think the worst \"bug\" I found was a misspelling. \n\nSteam achievements are reasonable - no ridiculous grindy achieves, and only one is truly very difficult IMO (6 rune \"The Mountain\" eesh).\n\nIt starts out easy but quickly ramps up to varying levels of challenge. Lots of maps, with some being easy with obvious win-strats, but also some very good challenges and not-so-obvious strats. It's clear that most maps have multiple ways to complete them - this is a huge plus IMO. Nonetheless you quickly find that your go-to strat on the last couple maps no longer works on the next map - I had to adapt constantly.\n\nCan't say enough good stuff about this game, definitely a 9 or 9.5 out of 10. Only complaints would be that some of the traps seemed underpowered (and even here, I probably just didn't figure out the best way to leverage them), and one trap was given too late.

Way more towers than most games, lots of levels, good difficulty level, great game. \n\nI think this might be the best Tower Defense game I've played. I played a lot starting with Warcraft 3 mods, and then Desktop Tower Defense the flash game. Since then I've played dozens of TD games, on iPhone, Android, and PC. They all have pros and cons, PVZ is unique and fun but not all that interesting or deep, Gemcraft is the same and also grindy, Defence Grid is great and has really nice graphics but the game maybe lacks a little of something, Bloonz is great but a bit repetitive, Creeper World is smart yet shallow and quite sedate, etc..etc.. I could easily list 20 more.\n\nBut there is something about this game that just ticks all the right boxes. It is challenging without being a pain in the ass, you sometimes have to do a level a few times until you can finally nail it, but it is always doable without relying on luck or something. Also some games don't let you shape your path which annoys me, this game has plenty of path shaping so you get to pick different routes through the map. There are actually at least several ways to win each map, not just with the paths you make the creeps take, but with tower selection too. There are a LOT of towers in this game, unlike the lame TD games that only give you several, this one has something like 20 ish towers, each one with a unique effect, and each one upgradeable which sometimes gives an extra effect too. The maps are also made so that you use the environment a lot, there are bottomless pits, pools of lava, spikes on the wall, etc. You can sometimes ignore all of that and just win using towers, but sometimes you really need to use traps that fling enemies off the ledge into a pit or slam them into the spikes. There are also railroads running through many of the maps and you can again ignore these if you want, but it is a lot more efficient to make the creeps run along the path of the railway and get injured or killed by the mine carts that race along them. \n\nThe graphics are retro pixelly style but they look nice enough to be able to make out what everything is clearly, and everything has its own style and feel, each creep type works in a unique way and looks unique, the towers are easy to spot by looking at them etc. The game is also very satisfying when killing stuff. Creeps don't just die like some TD games, in this game they die violently based on what killed them, so if you throw them into a pit they shout AAAAAAAAAAHH!! If you smack them into spikes they will splat with a cloud of blood. If you electrocute them they ZAP! with a satisfying sizzle. In a game that is all about carnage, I think this is important, and the devs did a good job of it.\n\nAlso there is some longevity with the gameplay as well, each map has modifiers so you can play in normal mode which is fine for below average players. They might have to replay some missions while they are figuring the game out, but mostly I think they will win each map first time. But if you click the Blood modifier for example, it means you have only 1 life. I can win each map with that enabled and it gives more XP for each map. And there are many more that increase that further but make it much harder. And there are even ones that lower the health of the creeps to make it easier. So you can easily tweak the game to be a bit easier or harder depending on how good you are at the game. Overall I think this only changes the amount of grind in the game. If you are good and can win each map with the 1 life modifier like I do, it means there is no grind at all in the game. You don't need to re-play any levels, you can just keep going on to the next new map and you will already have enough gear to beat that. If you struggle with maps and are maybe getting less XP from not using any modifiers, and therefore getting fewer upgrades, you might need to re-play a few maps to level up. But in terms of grind this is nothing like some games. Overall this game just seems to be about giving you a fun time. \n\nThere are a decent number of levels, good for the price, and there are many more you can download on Steam Workshop.  Most TD games I just play to completion and then don't go back, there are only a few that I have completed multiple times, and this one of those games.\n\np.s.

Leveling towers, upgrade trees, gradual unlocking, ye olde basic dart tower that gets left on the side of the road as better towers are unlocked. Those of you familiar with Gemcraft will find a friendly skeuomorph in the wave bar. Difficulty is controled with a set of runes which will be familiar to those who've played Bastion. There's a novelty here though, as one of the runes makes the round easier in trade for lower XP gain. A brilliant use of the system.\n\nWarfare stands out though by being significantly puzzle baised without being an actual puzzle (generally). Maps tease multiple optimal solutions with only a handful turning out be legitimate.

Watching a harpoon trap drag heavy units into magma rarely gets old. While a delight the physics traps are no panacea, levels sometimes lack waste disposal chutes necessitating direct damage. The little blood explosions and pixel gibs help elevate the established spike and dart traps above their peers.\n\n\nEthos:\nThe lightning trap is crap, the slot machine is fun but when one of the result is self-destruct it's limited, the lich crypt while in theory fun takes up one of the 9 slots that could be better spent, calling a new wave always gives the same reward regardless of time left to it, lv4 lightning trap hits air lv3 does not what does and does not hit air is not delineated, dart towers have no utility or reason to use them later on, the lock on how far you can zoom out makes it hurt to look at for long periods on large screens.", "timestamp_created": 1483306682, "timestamp_updated": 1483306682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28894957": {"recommendationid": "28894957", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993240363", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488784608}, "language": "english", "review": "Best tower defence game I played in years.

It's diverse, complex, balanced, deep, and puzzling - everything you want in a strategy game. It has charming visuals (I'm not usually one for pixel-y nostalgia graphics but it works well here) and the sound design is spot-on. I will buy anything else this publisher produces and will buy any DLC. Quality is on par with FTL.\n\nEDIT: Two weeks later and I'm on the final level.

exactly like Orcs Must Die!, except it's not 3D and it's slightly lower quality graphics, and there's no hero running around.  But otherwise... same game pretty much: kill the adventurers (not orcs) that are running through the dungeon.\n\nCustom user-generated maps are in the workshop.  This is really great, and the community seems pretty active.\n\nThere are runes that act as handicaps and provide an XP multiplier (or divider, in case you want the game to be easy).  And the runes are introduced over several levels, which adds a little.  I appreciate the thought that went into the design.\n\nThe UI and voice acting, even in the UI, are pretty good and funny with everything detuned down about 3 octaves.  If you enjoy hearing splat and screaming sounds of adventurers falling to their deaths, this game is probably for you.\n\nSome of the levels are insanely difficult.

into a frantic test of wits and resource management. As the levels get progressively more open and the enemies faster and stronger, you're challenged to find the most efficient way of dispatching the advancing horde. Steam says I've got 20 hours in as of writing this review and there are still towers and enemies I've yet to encounter. Admittedly, I'm crap at the game, but having a ball just the same. If you're a wizard at such games, you also have the option of handicapping yourself with any number of debuffs through the rune system. I have a couple minor gripes. The art style is nice, but the soundtrack is limited - one song during battle, one for the map/leveling screen. These become quite repetitive. Futher, I'd like to be able to pull the camera out futher to be able to see the entire map, though that may be part of the management aspect. I just find it annoying as valuable time is wasted scrolling around. The variety of enemies is vast, and their unique characteristics require a mix of traps as you advance. Further, traps become progressively more expensive, so spamming (for example filling the room with floor spikes) will quickly drain your resources and leave you exposed. The numerous maps coupled with the replay options added through the rune system make it well worth the asking price for anyone who enjoys tower defense style games.", "timestamp_created": 1479880354,

I got really tired of not having all the tools I wanted for any given map.\n\nAlso there's a lot of random chance involved in trap behavior and enemy movement.  Maybe your pusher trap will catch a whole lot of enemies, or maybe it will only push one!  Even if you set things up to clump up enemies the pusher will sometimes just fail to work properly or miss some of the clump.  There's serious reliability issues, which makes the fast-moving enemies that ignore demons (one of the best ways to control enemy movement) MAJOR problems, even if you plan for them.  You basically just have to hope that the setup you have is enough for whatever the level throws at you.\n\nI don't like having to HOPE.  I want to be able to PLAN.\n\nEdit: okay, now you can see what all the units in each wave are by scrolling the waves.  Yet that doesn't solve some of the most irritating problems with this game: MASS UNITS.  The game loves to throw like 50 of one type at you, and if your setup isn't specifically made to deal with that and actually WORKS to deal with that, you're screwed.

Dungeon Warfare allows for path building, changing of weapons arsenal, upgrades, & funny physics when the lil' dudes bite the dust.  Pushing them off the side or springboarding them away is especially enjoyable.  There are a lot of new ideas here, plus old ones done well.  I'm not sure why more people don't own this one.  For me it's up there with Bloons or Gemcraft.  Dungeon Warfare deserves a wider audience.  I am 8 hours in and only 30% through the map or so, and still the game is trhowing different challenges at me.  Some are action based, but nothing insane thus far.  The formulae is core tower defence with tons of creative destruction...  Lots of blood & gibs as well.  STill, the retro style makes it appropriate for a coffee break cool-down with comic violence akin to 16-bit games.  It makes me laugh sometimes at the sheer number of lemming-like soldier marching to their doom in the 100s and 1000s.  <Insert evil boss laugh here>  The antihero element is perhaps too entertaining.  There is far more than $10 worth of fun here.  And I'm not nearly finished yet!  Dungeon Warfare is an overlooked deamon -I mean diamond!- in the rough.

But it has its problems.\n\nThe graphics and music are well done in the 8-bit era style, nothing to complain here.\n\nThe gameplay reminded me of Orcs Must Die (or Dungeon Keeper even). You place traps that finish your enemies in various, graphical and delicious ways. In addition to the traps, the levels can have boulders and pits which you can use to your advantage.\n\nHowever, due to the nature of traps, the game lacks some depth. Why? Well, it all boils down to fact that traps have very limited range of operation AND the path is one-way (i.e enemies just run from start to end). Some traps operate on larger area, but the trigger area is usually quite small, like one tile. This means that the path can actually be considered a single line on which you place the traps, and each trap can only affect one short part of the path. And because different traps benefit from proximity, the most efficient solution is usually a small \"death alley\" where you grind everything to pulp (or toss/drag the in the pits). \n\nIn many TD games you can use the tower range to your benefit by placing towers in such places that they cover as large area as possible, and areas as early AND as late as possible (to make use of giving your tower more time to work on the enemies). In Dungeon Warfare there is simply no such thing. (Well, there is, but it's more like a special case).\n\nOnce you realize this, it eats a bit of the experience. Even the most fancy and complex levels can be solved with concentrating on a small space, effectively ignoring much the level. \n\nThe game does get a bit more complex in the end. And for the record, I haven't completed the game yet, I think I'm at 70% or so.\n\nSome random issues:\n* Start of the game was quite heavily tutorialized, but nothing annoying\n* Trap tiers and upgrading traps was NOT tutorialized, didn't learn this until later on when wondering what the \"tier\" means\n* Going back to old levels to finish the optional gem levels is a bit stupid as all your upgrades make the game super easy (why not limit traps and/or slots per level?)\n* Music is slightly repetitive... I cannot understand why many indie games have such a short soundtrack. Easy way to add value, folks!\n\nDespite all this I'm still enjoying the game quite a bit, and wholeheartedly recommend it. It's just that with some design changes the game could be even better. Maybe for DW2? :)\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1467754664, "timestamp_updated": 1467754664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24090392": {"recommendationid": "24090392", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996623543", "num_games_owned": 766, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470331641}, "language": "english", "review": "Pushing, pulling and throwing heroes into pits only to hear their fading screams will not get old fast.", "timestamp_created": 1467660311, "timestamp_updated": 1467660311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24021005": {"recommendationid": "24021005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032768860", "num_games_owned": 549, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480246855}, "language": "english", "review": "A great tower defense game with a huge variety of towers, enemies and possible strategies.\n\nThis is a hidden gem of a very good tower defense game, comparable with Defender's Quest and Gemcraft, but ten times less known. What can you expect from the game?\n\n- A huge variety of upgradable towers, unlocked gradually so you can learn about each one\n- Respeccable skill points that you can (and must) distribute according to the map you're going to play\n- Challenge modes that make the maps more difficult in exchange for better rewards\n- An endless mode with ever harder waves \n- User-created maps and a map editor\n\nMost of the fun comes from the well designed towers and traps. In their most basic form, TD games have usually three types of towers - the reliable peashooter, the slow firing group damager and a slowing tower. In Dungeon Warfare you can of course use these basic towers and combine them with traps such as:\n- Spikes shooting from the ground\n- A harpoon pulling an enemy towards the abyss\n- A push trap that pushes whole groups in the direction you wish\n- A blackhole that sucks nearby enemies onto a single tile, making them a better target for the following AoE attacks\n- A lich that turns any enemy it kills into a zombie fighting on your side\n- A rotating spintrap rising from the ground and hacking everyone who comes near into minced meat\n- A hex trap that turns an enemy into a frog\n\nThere are many effective combinations you can find and there is no set way of finishing a level. For example so far my go-to killzone consists of a chessboard of spintraps and spikes with a blackhole at the beginning and a spring trap at the end. The spintraps and spikes deal most of the damage to groups, blackhole pulls enemies periodically back so they have to travel through the kill zone again and the spring trap throws any straggler back into the fray. Sprinkle with a few liches to further slow down enemies and a gold enhancer and put a grinder at the end for any heavy units that make it through.\n\nAnother favourite strategy that some maps support is a using lot of push plates and harpoons combined with a slow trap, disposing of enemies by pushing/pulling them into the abyss. This is especially useful for large groups of slow, heavy enemies. It doesn't however work on thieves and horsemen who are too fast for the push plates and run through. Those must be disposed with a spintrap/flamethrower or spikes. The abyss also doesn't pose danger to flying enemies, those are better killed with a lightning trap and bolts.\n\nAll enemies have their weight and pushing/pulling traps have their force, so light enemies will get pushed further/faster than heavy ones, something you have to take into account. You can upgrade your push traps to have more force, but if there is a walkway behind the abyss, light enemies might get pushed too far and land safely on the other side, while if the trap is too weak, heavy knights and golems don't even move. Of course this can also be used to your advantage, as you can create endless cycles forcing groups of light enemies to go through your killzone multiple times...\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nGraphically the game looks very simple, but unfortunately the screenshots don't make the game any favor as they look very chaotic. When in motion the game is quite clear and you know what is happening.\n\nDon't let the screenshots dissuade you.\n\nAll in all Dungeon Warfare is a very good entry in the TD genre, well worth playing.", "timestamp_created": 1467477215, "timestamp_updated": 1467495663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606050", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23965354": {"recommendationid": "23965354", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969327904", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461661403}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a nice TD that has nice traps and enemies.

But I also think it's fair to claim this will not be everyones cup of tea. It is cruel! The 10 or 20 first hours or so was a pure drudgery (for me anyway). I think the progression feels slow before you get adjusted to it. You can adapt the difficult settings for more points, so you are never completely blocked but it's way too easy to bite off more then you can chew, you get stomped and in turn this makes many levels feel very intimidating. Unlocking new levels felt like a punishment Instead of a reward. \n\nBut it grew on me, and especially after unlocking all towers and getting to run the whole thing over again to beat every map with 6 runes (the last achievment) it all turned out to be very satisfying. And I truly believe this is one of the better tower defense games out there. \n\nLengthy, challenging, and with a plethora of strategies to try out. \n\n\nSome of the bad stuff (that I think should be fixed):\n* Leaving a map and trying to find the same map in the \"mystery meat\" navigation of 40+ levels is retarded to say the least. Maybe highlight last played map?\n* Or better yet: fix the real problem, allow respeccing your skill points when in a map, so you don't have to leave it to change a tower or skill point.\n* I find the \"tower styles\" that indicate with how many runes you have completed a map is ambiguous at best.

Generally towers work well when used in combination with others, e.g. a choke point with a spike trap and demons to prevent enemy movement.\n+ Simple physics system with numerous towers that take advantage of it, e.g. harpoon trap pulls enemies towards it and potentially into a pit, spring traps can launch enemies to another part of the maze, etc.\n- The retro graphics style, while not bad, does make it unclear at times what's happening. It's at times impossible to mouse-over a specific entity for more info.\n- No zoom function. Not a massive problem, but it would have been a nice addition.\n- All units seemingly share the same soundset - golems that fall to their deaths will use the same scream as a peasant.\n- Consumable trap feature (basically the \"spell\" slot) - while it's not a bad thing, I would have liked to see this as an optional feature. The way I like to play TDs is to do all the planning (building of towers) and then just watch the carnage without having to micro-manage the battle using spells.

And although I haven't found the game where you are constantly upgrading your dungeon and expanding it. This game is one of the best I've played honestly. It's easily up with Bloons TD5 as one of my favorite Tower defense games. All the traps are fun and unique, all the reusable powers are better for each level. Lots of replayability with Endless mode on every map. I don't think there were too many actual flaws with this game at all, I did have a couple of glitches on the final boss. But the battle was so fun I didn't mind playing it 3 times. And... was that a Hearthstone refrence I caught at the end of it?! I was a bit in disbelief. This game is easily worth the full price. And if a sequel comes out I will most certainly be getting it the day of.

Um belo dia entrei na steam e filtrei por \"Tower Defense\" para achar algum jogo interessante deste g\u00eanero que me agrada mas que muitos dos t\u00edtulos ou s\u00e3o completamente baseados em grind ou port de mobile que muitas vezes vem com aquele sistema que apesar de n\u00e3o ser Pay to Win \u00e9 baseado em grind a todo instante, foi ai que achei Dungeon Warfare e meus amigos, que grata surpresa!\n\nDungeon Warfare funciona da seguinte maneira: Voc\u00ea apenas coloca armadilhas dos mais variados tipos para impedir que os inimigos cheguem ao n\u00facleo do jogo (sua base) e destrua ela por completo. Simples n\u00e3o \u00e9 verdade? \n\nNo jogo o jogador vai ter v\u00e1rias op\u00e7\u00f5es de armadilhas, v\u00e1rias miss\u00f5es e o melhor: A possibilidade de aumentar a dificuldade ou diminuir a dificuldade atraves de Runas, ou seja. Quer aumentar a dificuldade da partida? coloque runas que v\u00e3o aumentar o poder dos inimigos ou at\u00e9 mesmo tirar algumas vantagens do seu jogo. Ou melhor, quer facilitar o jogo por que est\u00e1 achando demasiado complicado? tamb\u00e9m tem runas para isso. \u00c9 s\u00f3 usar da maneira que quiser e ser feliz.\n\nIsso funciona de maneira espetacular j\u00e1 que por este motivo o jogo n\u00e3o se torna um exerc\u00edcio de GRIND como diversos jogos do g\u00eanero aqui da Steam, ele funciona perfeitamente para jogadores casuais e hardcores, sem grind e sem frustra\u00e7\u00f5es.\n\nLembrando que colocando mais runas e deixando o jogo mais complicado, voc\u00ea ganha mais XP e consequentemente evolui mais r\u00e1pido, assim ganhando pontos e aumentando os poderes de suas armadilhas e outras coisas.\n\nDungeon Warfare possui o gr\u00e1fico estilo pixelado que pode afastar alguns jogadores que n\u00e3o gostam deste estilo gr\u00e1fico. Da minha parte n\u00e3o \u00e9 um ponto negativo j\u00e1 que eu amo jogos com este estilo gr\u00e1fico, al\u00e9m de que o jogo fica super leve e podendo rodar em qualquer computador. Sem contar que as miss\u00f5es s\u00e3o todas bem feitas e bonitas, nada a reclamar.\n\nA trilha sonora combina perfeitamente com a tem\u00e1tica do jogo, nada a destacar mas tamb\u00e9m nada a reclamar sobre a mesma.\n\nA dura\u00e7\u00e3o do jogo deve ser por volta de 15 - 20 horas pelo que eu vi em algumas an\u00e1lises aqui na Steam, mas voltarei futuramente para comentar sobre a dura\u00e7\u00e3o do jogo. \n\nO game ainda possui conquistas + cartas e \u00e9 praticamente livre de bugs.\n\nDungeon Warfare \u00e9 o t\u00edpico jogo Tower Defense que se destaca por n\u00e3o apelar para grind ou ser um port tosco de plataforma mobile. Ele \u00e9 diferente, seus gr\u00e1ficos s\u00e3o bonitos e estilizados, a trilha sonora combina perfeitamente com o tema do jogo e oferece uma dificuldade male\u00e1vel para todo e qualquer tipo de jogador.\n\n\u00c9 um \"Must Buy\" para qualquer f\u00e3 de Tower Defense, que ainda procura uma tem\u00e1tica mais voltada para o RPG.\n\nRecomendo!\n\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only

more well known titles, and the developers are actively supporting it right from the start.\n\nI'm a huge tower defense fan, and I took a chance randomly buying this on an impulse that it might be something special. Indeed, within 10 hours of gameplay it entered my top 3 all time favourites of the genre. It's basically Dungeon Keeper (you are the evil dungeon master and you slay waves of \"good\" adventurers) mixed with Orcs Must Die (the violence and the general tower defense ideas) but without any hero micromanagement. Of course this is all presented with bland retro-style pixel graphics but who cares? Functional visuals in a great game is fine with me.\n\nAll in all I approve of this formula. I love Orcs Must Die (and Dungeon Keeper for that matter) but the action/hero aspect of Orcs Must Die was always my least favourite part of the game. I prefer more strategy and less action. Maximum violence certainly, but strategic violence, and this game delivers strategic violence by the bucketload.

By beating levels you will earn diamonds that can be used to upgrade weapons and traps. Upgrades can be changed for different levels or different play styles. Twelve runes can be individually activated or deactivated for each level to make the game harder and earn more diamonds.\n\nThe game also comes with a simple to use level editor and a Steam workshop that offers levels from other players.

watch youtube videos to discover new strategies, even for levels you already completed, because you can play levels a lot of different ways.\n\nThe game looks to be between 20 and 30 hours long, and

A lot of TD games are either too easy or too hard but this game just gets it right: \n\nMost of the levels are easily winnable on the first try, which is a good thing because of the \"rune\" mechanic. Runes allow you to customize the difficulty in a really big way, making even the easiest levels challenging if you include all 10 of the difficulty-increasing ones. There is, however also one that allows you to play \"endless\" mode and another one that significantly decreases the difficulty at the cost of the experience you gain from it, which I find really helpful for players that get frustrated when playing the same level over and over without success. This makes for a perfect difficulty progression.\n\nAnother important aspect that really sets this apart from most other TD games is that the variety of towers - or rather:  traps - is remarkable as there are traps that push enemies, traps that pull enemies, traps that spawn minions to stall enemies, AOE traps, traps that counter fast enemies and so on.... This makes for very strategic gameplay because you need to have a good trap composition to counter every type of enemy that comes within a certain level.\n\nAs if it didn't have enough replayability already, this game has a built-in easy-to-use level editor and there are already a lot of user-created maps on the workshop. This is pretty cool but I haven't used it a lot as of the time I write this review (7-8 hours in).\n\nMy only real complaint previously was the lack of key rebinding options but that was fixed soon after I posted this review initially.", "timestamp_created": 1447507162, "timestamp_updated": 1447944952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19040778": {"recommendationid": "19040778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005153811", "num_games_owned": 1043, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456699363}, "language": "english", "review": "Tower defense veteran here. Dungeon Warfare plays out similarly to a 2d version of Orcs Must Die, without a controllable hero. The scoring is also calculated in the same manner - Enemies have a score value and that value is multiplied by the # of different traps involved in their demise. You earn bonus points and gold for killstreaks.\n\nThere is a rune system (similar to the trait system used in GemCraft games) for added challenge that adds a multiplier to your level score. If you beat a stage, the resulting score is given to you in EXP, which allows you to level up, which gives you increased skill points, starting gold, and trap slots (up to 9). You cannot repeatedly farm a stage for EXP, as only increases in your highest score will net more EXP. Every level also has an endless mode, which is unlocked if you  complete the stage with 4 or more runes. Endless mode is a great way to earn extra EXP, as your score for it is separate from your normal high score. There is also an individually selectable rune to make the game easier, for those who want to progress without as much challenge, but you will earn less points.\n\nDifficulty is fairly well balanced. Most of the early stages are a breeze, but later ones will keep even good players up to devise better strategies. There are also interesting achievements to seek out if you are inclined.\n\nGraphics are gritty, fitting the theme. The game has a dark, medieval steampunk look. Nothing looks impressive or detailed.\n\nThe music is redundant. I found it to also fit the theme, but there weren't many tracks. Sounds are limited, but great - especially when units fall into pits.\n\nEnemy variety is important for TD games and there is plenty in this one. There are some that will annoy you, like the horse or dwarf. It's good for a tower defense game to have threatening enemies. Trap (tower) variety is great. There are plenty of interactive cooldown traps to keep you busy.\n\nThere is also a map maker included.

Pesky heroes are assailing your various lairs en masse and it's down to you to devise elaborate combinations of booby traps and minions to keep them at bay.  Unlike most tower defense games where you're given a bevy of said towers to line some paths and periodically make some mazes, Dungeon Warfare's arsenal plays much more heavily into utilizing the surroundings and managing the different sorts of heroic intruders battering at your dungeon doors.\n\nOne of the most ready examples of this are the pits and chasms that you'll find in many of the locales; there are a number of physics and movement related traps that can push, catapult or pull intruders off ledges and send them tumbling into the abyss (the harpoon trap being particularly brutal and fun--firing a big tethered javelin into enemies and 'reeling them in'.)  \n\nDifferent enemies have different properties, so a heavily armored knight is a bit harder to push around than their lighter fare.  Horsemen try to rush through your arsenal to batter down doors and bee-line for your inner sanctum, dwarves seek out your barricades to sap and destroy, adventurers try to duke it out with your minions and are generally nimble, etc.  Similarly, stages can include tracks with mine carts circulating them to plow enemies around in dangerous intersections, spiked walls ready for you to shove lines of troops against them, etc.  You'll also find giant boulders you can set tumbling to crush everyone in its path.\n\nThere are quite a few different traps and setups available at your disposal which can compliment one another fairly well.  I'm pretty fond of a lair that brings about a little necromancer who will go about raising slain enemies as a tiny army of skeletons.  Many of the traps bring Orcs Must Die to mind--but they're solid to take inspiration from (such as the springboards that launch enemies into pits, for instance.)  \n\nAccompanying the traps are a bevy of cooldown-based powers you can utilize ranging from giant bear traps to bombs to eggs which hatch minions when enemies draw near or power-ups for your traps.  There is also an excellent 'trap mastery' system wherein you can invest gems to unlocking upgrades for your traps, reducing cooldowns / costs, making them do more damage, etc. (gems being earned by completing stages well and leveling up.)  You can also put gems into basic upgrades such as being able to sustain more enemies in your sanctum before losing, or starting the stages with more gold to work with--and leveling up also gives you more gold to start with as well.\n\nAdditionally, there are 'runes' which can be activated for stages to make them more challenging (faster enemies, fewer resources, limited load-out of traps, etc.) in exchange for more experience bonuses.  Completing a stage with four runes active unlocks the ability to play that stage in 'endless mode' for additional challenge.  Between the runes, large variety of traps and tools, I feel like there's plenty of mileage to be had--and that's before taking into consideration that the game includes a pretty easy to use map editor and Steam Workshop support.  Cool!\n\nIt's hard to fully do the full aesthetic experience of Dungeon Warfare justice in text and I feel like the screenshots don't necessarily do the game justice--but when you've got an elaborate gauntlet of death traps going full-force and a hoard of invaders trying to barge their way through it, it really gets quite rad.  It may seem a bit low-fi at first glance, but when grinders and darts and spring-loaded spikes are firing away while lightning arcs are chaining between knights and necromancers and demons are keeping footmen mired in boiling oil, it's all to fun effect.\n\nIf you're the sort that typically gives tower defense style games a pass, I'd urge a bit of a longer look at this one--I was very surprised by how deep it got its hooks in me; it is definitely the sort of game that if it clicks with you, you'll want to keep pushing on for 'just one more stage.'\n\nEdit: Since release, Dungeon Warfare continues to receive excellent developer support by way of additional polish, making it all the more an excellent little game to revisit in your library!", "timestamp_created": 1447084503, "timestamp_updated": 1479925133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684503", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18971885": {"recommendationid": "18971885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115563050", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 575, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493916227}, "language": "english", "review": "Standard td with a slight twist.

Being able to view all the wave lists before you start rather than just see the first six would be a good change.\n\nA lot of the levels are clearly designed for you to use barricades to create a long and winding path of death to make the enemy march through. Or they have mine cart tracks to direct them onto. However due to the dwarves blowing up barricades it's often better just not to bother even trying to direct them. On endless mode it quickly becomes pointless having more than one or two barricades meaning that a lot of space on the level is unused. A lot of time is just spent with the repair tool hovering over what few barricades you do have and that gets a little tedious too.\n\nI kind of think that the fully upgraded turret wielding version should be indestructible as it would give you a lot more options and makes levels more fun. Also it is kind of odd that you can build floor traps on top of this barricade which do nothing, except the lightning turret with AOE. It would be good if it could also use the AOE affects from some of the other traps, like poison, fire or bleed.\n\nOnce I had worked that much out and defeated the suicide bombers I got up past a million points on endless on one level only for my portal to be swamped by riderless horses that just charged through everything with dead riders but without a scratch on them. The giant stone golems and the heavily armoured knights fell before they'd even reached my main line of defence but the horses? Despite repeatedly running into walls and bouncing around all over the place whilst on fire and frozen with three harpoons in their backs and non stop lightning bolts frying them they still made it through. So yeah I think they might be a little bit over the top in their current state. Their speed and fact that they don't stop to fight liches or demons makes them powerful enough without also have more health than Jesus... and like Jesus you have to kill them twice.\n\nAlso when you do reach that stage in the game where the entire screen is filled with enemies you can't really see to build or upgrade anything. A build mode toggle option to hide all enemies whilst you place a turret would be nice.

I have yet to play through everything or even get the chance to use every tower. If my views change as I play more, I'll update this review.\n\n[b]In Brief[/b]\n\nIf you like Tower Defense games, you will like this one. It doesn't do anything to revolutionize the genre, but throws in some cool towers/traps that add a nice twist, such as being able to push and pull mobs into pits. The pixel style is simple but both looks good and has good animations. The style most likely contributes to the games excellent performance, even when there are a lot of moving and effects on screen. The addition of a map editor is excellent, as most of my time so far has actually been making and playing my own levels. You can also share these levels to the Workshop as well as download and play the creations of other people, giving the game great replayability.\n\n[b]Technical Stuff[/b]\n\nLike I said, the game performs great. I had no issues with anything slowing down, glitching graphically, etc. I was also pleased to see the game ran perfectly despite my two monitor set up. It naturally assumed a Borderless Window sort of mode at 1920x1080 without any adjustments necessary. It's easy to click out to other windows if need be (which with games like this, I'm usually multitasking) and there were no issues using ALT+TAB to get in/out of the game.\n\n[b]Minor Complaints[/b]\n\nI think it would be nice to be able to zoom out a bit more than you are, but I don't know if that's technically possible with how the game is made. You do get some fairly large levels to play sometimes, and scrolling around and keeping track of things sort of artificially (perhaps intentionally?) makes the game harder.\n\nUpgrading traps sometimes has the button appear underneath something else, such as a little dropdown at the top of the screen that shows you stats/info about the turret itself. You can still click the button easily enough, but it's just a nuisance that you can't really see what you're doing.", "timestamp_created": 1446868212, "timestamp_updated": 1446868212, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517986", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18921162": {"recommendationid": "18921162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086953670", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 4883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458011595}, "language": "english", "review": "Tower defense?

Man ist der Besitzer einen Dungeons und Horden von Helden wollen einem das Herz des Dungeons zerst\u00f6ren.\nUm die Helden daran zu hindern, kann man seinen Dungeon mit Fallen spicken.\n\nDort aufsteigenden Schwierigkeitsgrad und freischaltbaren neuen Fallen, hat man von Anfang an eine Lernkurve und f\u00fchlt sich eigentlich nie \u00fcberfordert. Mit ein wenig Planung, schafft man die ersten Level recht leicht, ohne auch nur einen einzigen Gegner bis zu seinem Herz vordringen zu lassen.\n\nZus\u00e4tzlich bietet das Spiel noch einen Leveleditor, welcher leider noch ein paar Bugs beinhaltet (Vertikale T\u00fcren verschwinden einfach beim Laden des Levels). Die Level lassen sich dann per Mausklick \u00fcber den Workshop mit anderen Spielern teilen.\n\nDas Spiel kommt mir pers\u00f6nlich nie langweilig vor und genie\u00dfe aktuell noch jede Minute, die ich mit der Fallenplanung verbringe.\n\nUm aus dem TD Einerlei herauszustechen, w\u00fcrde ich mir allerdings noch \"Monster\" w\u00fcnschen, welche man ebenfalls in den Dungeon einb\u00fcrgern kann.

Whether the devs re-balanced the traps in later updates I wouldn't know).

And you liked \"Orcs must die!\"? Then you'll love \"Dungeon Warfare\".\nIt's basically OMD without Orcs but with the usual fantasy-dudes.\n\nSometimes very challenging at first, at least if you want to \"3-Star\" every map from the start, which\ngets slightly easier the more traps you unlock and the more gems you've earned. Sometimes\nyou'll just lack the more fitting trap for some maps. \n\nAnd even if you've 8-runed (each rune adds another difficulty like faster/harder/tougher mobs etc) all maps with 3 stars, you're not done. There's a very nice and\neasy editor to make your own maps. In not 1 hour i've put together a very nice map with lots\nof rounds that was actually fun to play. You can also publish your map right from the game.\n\nBut...early access?\nThis is by far the most complete, balanced and bugfree Alpha i've played in a while. I have\nnot much doubt the dev will deliver a fully polished product.\nBut even if he'd stop right now, i would not feel scammed, as it was a lot of fun for not much bucks :-)\n\n[u]The good:[/u]\n[list]\n[*] Free placement of traps, no stupid fixed points (which are usually favoured by the lazy devs because it's easier to balance)\n[*] Thanks to barricades: Mazing!\n[*] Nice soundtrack (so far) and fitting SFX. Kicking mobs into a pit is very satisfying, even after 100 of them :-)\n[*] Many more or less different enemies, each with its own strength and weakness\n[*] All the usual OMD-traps and some more, all upgradeable\n[*] ONE godly power you'll choose before a map. Like traps, spawns or a general recharge-reduction...\n[*] Zoom-out-function for the quick overview\n[*] You'll earn gems for which you can make traps better/cheaper/faster. Like the skulls in OMD\n[*] You're leveling. Each levelup yields some gems and more importantly it raises starting gold for each map!\n[*] Good balancing, considering it's still alpha, has leveling and upgradeable traps! No easy job to balance this. You'll need an asian for that ,-)\n[*] A nice, friendly and dedicated dev who even publicly posts his email.\n[*] A \"re-setup\" button after the first retry of a map. Never setup your traps manually all over again just because you've failed :)\n[*] Even though it's 2D you'll never loose the overview. Even when it gets hectic. \n[*] 3-Star-System (none reached portal etc.) and on top of that: 8 runes you can activate that makes maps harder. Restrict traps, make mobs tougher/faster/more aggressive, increases cooldown etc.\n[*] Easy to use editor included. Make your own maps!\n[/list]\n\n[u]The bad:[/u]\n[*] The sounds can become a bit annoying after some hundred dead troops :-)\n[*] AI seems even dumber than the orcs. If, e.g., mobs have the choice of 3 roads to take, they always choose the shortest way. Which means they choose the heavily trapped way instead of those free roads.\n[*] Totally no story at all (yet). I personally don't care, but some may very well care.\n[/list]\n\n[u]The ugly:[/u]\n[*] Nothing!\n[/list]\n\nRecommended? YES!

unlock more and more traps the already plentifull options to approach a level become even more, because different traps offer a whole new strategy.\n\nThe game is updated regularly and the Devs listen closely to the suggestions of the community, making it an overall enjoyable early access game.\n\nThe runes enable you to replay older levels time and time again to try and beat them with a higher and higher challenge and Exp reward, motivating you even way after you finished every level (so far).\n\nOne thing to keep in mind before making your purchase is that this game is NOT EASY!\nIf you are new to this genre you might be better of playing another TD :)\n\nAfter all this game is my early hit of the year both in terms of playstyle and Dev responses.\n5/5 :)", "timestamp_created":

This type of game is probably my favourite genre bar RPG. The game does a very good job of introducing different traps each level, allowing you to get to grips with each of them so you know how best to use them. \n\nThe art style is pleasant, I have no issues with a tower defence type game being in the pixel graphics. One of the cool features in Dungeon Warfare is before each level, you are able to select a rune (more than one if you want), each run has a specific debuf which affects you the whole level, but you'll also gain extra experience, there is also one rune which debuffs the enemy and buffs you, but you do get less experience, which is to be expected. \n\nI liked how you could spend gems which you gain for completing a level and going up a level on upgrading your traps. Personally I found the dart gun to be the most effective throughout the whole game.

Starting off with a couple of basic traps, you soon unlock more and more deadly ones, such as huge rolling boulders or portals to summon your own troops.  You also gain XP which can be used to purchase permanent upgrades for each trap, reducing cooldowns and increasing damage.\n\nIt\u2019s a fun game, and the difficulty level soon ramps up to offer a tough challenge that will have you fine tuning your dungeon layouts to get them just right \u2013 nobody steals your gold and gets away with it!", "timestamp_created": 1428548861, "timestamp_updated": 1428548861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591176", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15244566": {"recommendationid": "15244566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014383949", "num_games_owned": 2896, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 1154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484468071}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic little tower defense game, one of the best among the top-down point-and-click ones. I'd rate it right after Defense Grid. It's the traps that fling enemies around and the environmental hazards that make it special, they are very fun to put into place and the effects can be downright hilarious. Orcs Must Die had those first, but if you want the same kind of action without the running around (which for me detracts from the strategy, rather than adds to it), this is the game for you.\n\nThe progression system is pleasant and very flexible: new traps are unlocked by completing specific levels, and all levels you finish give you upgrade points to improve turrets. The twist is that those are not just passive upgrades: you unlock lvl 2 of your pusher traps, but you still have to upgrade them in the course of a level using gold from killing invaders. You can redistribute your upgrade points between levels to specialize differently. You can also increase the difficulty of a level by choosing challenges that grant you more XP if you win.\n\nLevel design is good with a lot of variety; some involve a little bit of mazing using barricades. Traps can mostly be placed in pre-existing walls \u2014 a few can be placed on the floor \u2014 so you don't get the type of freeform design present in Defense Grid where you can build elaborate mazes and your turret themselves act as walls. Perhaps some levels could allow you to place walls, or even some track sections! (Yes there are deadly minecarts running around.) \n\nOverall the gameplay is solid and interesting, so much so that while playing it I find myself wishing to see it used as the base of a larger game of dungeon management.

I love, love, LOVE Dungeon Warfare. As a Tower Defense game, it does everything right: It's easy to learn and challenging to beat. It features new variations on a classic theme.  It offers on-rails or creative placement, whichever you prefer. Most important: It's just plain fun.\n\nThere are nice touches here that weren't in the Greenlight version. First, there is a feature between levels that allows you to actually increase the difficulty of your game in up to 8 different ways (for example, by reducing your lives to only one, reducing the number of traps you can use, or increasing enemies' strength, speed, or health). Why would you want to do this? Because each additional, potentially crippling selection will increase your xp multiplier! In short, as long as you have the cajones, you can gain some serious xp and, thus, level in fairly short order.  Conversely, you can also make things a bit easier for yourself, at the cost of 40% off any experience you might earn for that board.\n\nThat said, the game still offers balance, and I've never felt overpowered, even as a level seven player on board three. Each level up grants you an ever-increasing number of gems that can be spent to power-up your traps. As new areas are conquered, branching paths open up, offering more variety. Beating each area offers its own rewards, ranging from gems to opening up new trap slots.\n\nSpeaking of variety, there are a number of interesting traps on offer, from push walls to floor spikes; from barricades to melee fighting, demon-spawning portals; from darts to spin blades. The fun comes in trying different combinations, along with using the environment. Watching a well-placed push wall shove an enemy into a bottomless pit, for example, is quite satisfying (and the humorous sound effects really make the moment).\n\nThere are a couple of things that could be improved upon (navigation of the playfield could be better implemented), but the simple truth is this: As I write this, Dungeon Warfare is only on its ninth alpha release, and it's [i]already[/i] in better shape than most full releases.

I have spoken with Groquest, one of the game's developers, for over a month about the game. Thanks to him, I was able to make videos on Youtube (linked at the bottom) about the game, and they show just how far Dungeon Warfare has come. Initially the game was pretty bare bones, but it was still immensly fun.\n\nThere are many different traps in the game that are unlocked by completing levels. The traps range from dart traps that shoot adventurers, to sticky traps that slow them down, to harpoon traps that fire into adventurers and pulls them into pits. There's something extremely satisfying about hearing an adventurer fall into an endless pit after being harpooned in the chest.\n\nI highly suggest this game to anyone looking for a strategy game, or a tower defense game. I have always been a huge fan of TD's, including Bloons, Orcs must Die, GemCraft, and many more. I often find myself playing a level or two every night just before bed. I definitely recommend this game.

And also, it\u2019s really difficult to design vary maps.\nUsually in this case, the differences between maps are only types of enemy or types of tower that you can build.\nThis limit is also connected to the difficulty of the leveling itself.\n\nActually, I prefer the Maze type TD, but it\u2019s really hard to find in the market recently. Because of the limit that I\u2019ve mentioned above, it\u2019s almost not proper as the product to sell. \n\nBecause its natural defect on the volume of the game.\n\n If you want to sell a TD to the gamer, you have to put \u201creasonable number of maps\u201d in the game. But not like one way TD, maze TD\u2019s maps can be really similar each other in the different meaning. Because for one way TD, developer can set only one path in one stage, but in the Maze TD there are so many possible ways to play in one stage. So to say numbers of map set itself, one way TD has really big advantage.\n\n\nSorry for so long prologue, but I just like to explain why I like this Dungeon Warfare this much.\n\n\nThis TD is ultimate-proper hybrid which is mix of those two types,\n\n\nDW, it\u2019s not fully maze type, but it is providing maximum level of the freedom for the player with the aspect below.\n\n1.\tThere is no tower type limit for stages, except very beginning of the game.\n\n2.\tAlways there are bypass to make a way.\n There are many kinds of obstacles in the map tile set that player can use. it can help player to make a maze or can be irritating.\n\n3.\tBut as a design of map, each map has its own character because of fascinating unique features that you would never find in another TD.\n(You never miss the mine cart)\n\nNot only the map design, but also there are many attractive in many aspects.\n\n\n1.\tYou can set the difficulty very specifically. Normally TD has very simple difficulty level, but in DW, you can set many kind of abilities of enemy.\nEspecially what I love is the \u201cweight of enemy\u201d. This thing can affect hugely to the game.\nThis is a really good example that simple physics how could help make game fun. Bigger unit is slower, heavier ,and harder to throw into the air.\nIt\u2019s really natural, but I couldn\u2019t stop laughing when I saw this.\n\n2.\tThere are many kinds of towers that you can get.\nI played only 14 hours, and I\u2019m really bad at gaming unfortunately, even I love so much.\nSo I couldn\u2019t go that far. But already I have 9 types of towers, and each of them are very fresh. Especially Harpoon, Push, and the spring.\nI will not mention the specific function of those here. Because if you see the towers in the game that I\u2019ve mentioned, you would know what I mean \u201cfresh\u201d.\n\n3.\tUser-friendly UI.\nExcept mini-map, which I want to complain about, There is all the needed user interface. Very comfortable to play, and very noticing.\n\n4.\tVolume of game.\n I wonder why this game has the early-access tag. This game seems already finished to build, well defined, and has enough volume to play not like other early-access.\nI heard there are 30 maps, and with the difficulty set up that I\u2019ve mentioned, I think it can guarantee more than 30 hours of playing time.\n\n\nBut also there are a few things must be improved further.\n\n\n1.\tMusic\nI know this is indie game, and there are no many developers to serve on this minor issue, but still it will be really nice if this game has more music.\nAlthough the main-theme is well made for an old gamer, but only one theme for almost 30 stages is still not satisfying.\n       I\u2019m playing with my own music, so actually this is not a big issue, but.. \n\n2.\tMINI MAP!!!!!\nPlease put a mini-map in the UI. It\u2019s really hard to notice if only one enemy sneak out from my maze in the big map. This defect can be more noticeable when you play multi-entry stages.\nEspecially when you play one-life mode, this can be really critical. \n\n\nSo I reviewed this game with my humble word, but I\u2019m pretty sure that I couldn\u2019t express enough the wonderfulness of this game.\n\nGo and get it, and it will give you the maximum fun for 10 bucks.", "timestamp_created": 1427071996, "timestamp_updated": 1427153683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.821337", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "14961125": {"recommendationid": "14961125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018139721", "num_games_owned": 518, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476934137}, "language": "english", "review": "Dungeon Warfare is the game where you kill or you die.\n\nTo more accurately describe the game, Dungeon Warfare is a tower-defense game focusing on installing traps in pre-defined dungeons in order to kill waves of enemies. The game starts you out with access to only two basic traps: The floor-mounted spike trap, which periodically juts up deadly spikes to damage the enemies above it, and the the wall-mounted dart trap, a device that continuously fires darts at whatever direction it is pointed at. As you progress through more of the levels, more traps types become available. Want to push enemies into a bottomless abyss? The pusher trap's got you covered. Want to burn them? The flamer will take care of that. Want to summon demons to fight for you? You can do that too. Each trap type is unique and varied, with over 13 different types as of this writing and more on the way. The fact that you can only take a limited number of trap types with you into a level means that you will need to plan out your defenses ahead of time. Often I've found myself having to decide just how I was going to deal with that massive wave of peasants in wave 5, for example.\n\nSpeaking of enemies, the enemies that you are fighting are more \"good\" than most things usually found in dungeons. In Dungeon Warfare YOU are the big bad evil guy, defending your portal from the legions of good. From the humble peasant, slow and weak but deadly in large numbers; the rough and tough warriors, able to take a beating; the theives, quick enough to bypass most of your traps; the mighty knights, that push your damage skills to the test; to the haughty nobles, that have more gold than they know what to do with; with over 12 different enemy types, every enemy in Dungeon Warfare is unique and presents a different challenge to the player.\n\nThe game deals with progression well, allowing the player to learn how to deal with each new enemy type over the course of levels. The game utilizes an experience system to reward the player with bonus starting gold for all levels, as well as \"gems\". In this game, gems are the currency used to upgrade the trap mastery of each trap, with increasing cost per level. For example, raising your spike trap mastery to level 5 takes 10 gems, as 1 (Level 2) + 2 (Level 3) + 3 (Level 4) + 4 (Level 5). The effects of trap mastery are twofold. Immediately, each increase in level affects the stats of a particular aspect of each trap type: For spike traps, it is a percentage increase in damage, for dart traps, the cooldown time between shots is decreased by a percentage, etc. There is no need it be worried about spending your gems on the wrong upgrades; at any time between levels the player can reset their gems at no cost, allowing them to mix up their play style for the next level. The second effect is that for every 5 levels in a trap mastery the player gains, the player unlocks a new tier of upgrades for that trap. These are straight upgrades that the player can spend gold on during a level to upgrade a single trap, and the upgrades often cost less than it does to place a new trap, although sometimes more can be better; again, depends on the playing field of the level.\n\nOn the topic of levels, for that matter, the game boasts a count of 29 unique maps as of this writing, with more levels being added each week. Also, while not currently implemented, the game will include a level editor that will allow the player to make their own custom levels and share them through steam workshop. Level layout will determine your strategy, forcing you to adapt. Some levels have natural defenses in them, such as bottomless abysses, thin corridors, and minecarts running through the map; figuring out how to best use what you're given is up to you.\n\nIn Dungeon Warfare, your experience total is the sum of all of your best scores across all levels, meaning that it pays to go back and revisit a level to boost your score. What seperates this from most games is the Modifier system that the game uses. In each level, you can choose from nine different modifiers that make the game more (or less!) challenging. Each modifier changes different aspects of the game: The \"Nil\" modifier decreases the bounty you get from killing enemies by 10%, forcing you to be frugal; the \"Anchor\" modifier increases enemy health by 5%, and enemy weight by 100%, making shoving them into the abyss much harder; the \"Breeze\" modifier is for those that are having difficulty, increasing the spawn times between waves, lowering enemy speed and health, but also cutting your score by 40%. All the modifiers affect your final score with multipliers, and up to 8 modifiers can be stacked (with the exception of the breeze modifier) to provide a massive challenge that, should you emerge victorious, gives you a outrageous multipler of x5.23 for your final score for the level. Be warned, this challenge is not for the weak; you will need all the skills you can muster for this monster difficulty.\n\nAll in all, Dungeon Warfare is a promising Early Access game. With more content being continuously added, massive replayability value, and a creator that is vocal and very visible to the public, this is one game you don't want to miss.

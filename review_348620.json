Sch\u00f6n im Piano stil gehalten was zu solchen Spielen \nrecht gut passt und sehr emotional wirkt.\n-Die Effekte waren jetzt nicht die besten oder die krassesten aber dennoch gut gelungen und beeinflussen das Spiel erlebnis sehr.\n-Die Hauptprotagonisten sind echt gut gemacht.\n-Die Story wurde insgesamt einfach, aber echt gut gehalten.\n-Man versp\u00fcrt nie Langeweile bei dem Spiel und ist immer gespannt was als n\u00e4chstes Passiert.\n-Das Spiel ist gerade einmal 30MB(download) gro\u00df!\n-Die Charaktere sehen generell gut aus.\n-Der Humor ist teilweise echt geil xD (sehe z.B. einer meiner Screenshots zum Spiel)\n-Man hat gut Entscheidungsm\u00f6glichkeiten auch wenn es meistens nur Muscheln betrifft ist es trotzdem witzig was passiert wenn man was anderes ausw\u00e4hlt :D\n\n[h1]FAZIT:[/h1]\nIch pers\u00f6nlich fand das Spiel echt gut. W\u00e4re das ganze nur nochmal \u00dcberarbeitet (z.B. wegen dem oben genannten Bug oder der Grafik) w\u00e4re das Spiel ne gute Ecke besser.

It takes about an hour to read through including the additional content from paid \"plus\" version. It's not amazing or especially surprising with its writing, but works well as a short story to cheer you up a bit on a boring afternoon.\n\nThe paid variant of the game unlocks voice acting and two small side stories (one of them purely humorous), but is not necessary to enjoy the story. I paid for it mostly to support the authors, but felt satisfied with what I got for my 5 dollars anyways - VA is pretty solid and the bonus stuff was all nice addition to the core content. It might be a bit too pricy for some, considering how short the whole game is, although if it ever goes on sale I can recommend it without any question.\n\n[b]In summary, while this VN is very simple, there's simply nothing to hate about it. It serves its purpose well both as a free product and in a feature-complete version. It's up to you whether you find the price/value ratio of the latter acceptable, but I think it's worth trying out either way.

I first encountered their art through a gift as a wee child (10-14yrs). At some point I found their website and immediately fell in love with all their art and their games. Skip ahead to a year ago and I found their booth at Ohayocon, where more of their lovely art was being sold by one of them (I never found out which ^-^;). So now I have at least 10 different prints from them.\n\n[u]Tidbit 0.25:[/u] If you like their art as much as I do, they've had a booth at Ohayocon for the past two years I've gone. They sell prints that aren't on their website so it's just better. Support indie creators! (\u00b4\u3078\u03c9\u3078`*)\n\n[b]Story:[/b]\nCantus is a boy that prefers to watch the waves on the beach than hang around others. One day, he meets Maris, the girl that changes his world in just seven days. The story could be seen as a slice-of-life, mystery, I see it as a coming of age story [spoiler](as Cantus comes to realize that he has many things to appreciate in his life that he takes for granted).[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Music and Visuals:[/b]\nI can\u2019t say much for the music. The music fit each scene well and was nice to listen to.\nThe opening movie isn't heavily animated, relying on stills with moving backgrounds to drawn you into the whimsy of what is unfolding. The opening gives the game a professional feel to this short and sweet game.\nCantus' perception of the world is characterized by contrasting visuals of the two parts of his life; the vibrantly colored beach, and the rest of his world a blank television-like screen. The contrast serves to show that the good parts of his life centers around the beach.\nThe art is clean and generally uses softer colors to give the game a lighter tone. \n\n[u]Tidbit 0.5:[/u] A nice feature is that the backgrounds are partially animated. It's a nice touch that I approve of.\nThe character design for Maris is simple and very moe. Her color palette draws you into her eyes, bringing attention to the bright emotions expressed.\nCantus has less of a monochromatic palette, but is still an original character design that's easy on the eyes. [spoiler](It's interesting that the things that he wears aren't to what he likes; rather, he wears the headphones and the shirt for an easier life.)[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nAs per most visual novels, there's reading...then clicking...then more reading...and so on. My problem with this VN is that almost every sentence needed another click. I'm a lazy person who prefers to absorb information asap. This is a downside to me.\nThe controls are easy to use and very accessible. The game allows for either mouse only or use of the keyboard to move through the dialogue.\nGenerally the game is pretty straight forward. As of playing this through once, there doesn't seem to be a deviating plot which one could take. \n\n[u]Tidbit 1:[/u] The game took my around an hour to play through, however, I do believe there's potential for multiple playthroughs, even with the free version. \n[u]Tidbit 2:[/u] The weather reports showed Cantus\u2019 emotions in a way that was  both comical and informative.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\nToo much clicky clicky tap tappy\nThe ending felt a bit unoriginal, however, that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. Well I guess it does when I put it under cons...\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\nArt is on point\nMusic is nice to listen to\nAnimated backgrounds!\nFree version is a good version to play (But money to the company is always nice too \u1555( \u141b )\u1557\n\n\n[b]Price:[/b]\nI got this free, but I definitely would pay for the Plus version (I have no money though ;-;)\n\n[b]Summary:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Art is high quality stuff (\u261e\uff9f\u2200\uff9f)\u261e\n[*]Story\u2019s cute but nothing new\n[*]Too much clicky clicky\n[*]Buy their art (*\uff9f\u2200\uff9f)\u3064\uff1dl\u30cb\u30cb\u30d5\n[*]Potatoes good cause it\u2019s a flash game\n[/list]\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]Get to know my potato:[/th]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Potato name: Kotetsu (age: approx. 6 yrs old)\n\n[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Computer: HP ProBook 4540s[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Processor: Intel i7-3612QM CPU with 2.10GHz\n\n[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]RAM: 8GB[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Graphics: Radeon HD 7650M[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\nThanks for reading my review!

novel is really generic, most are, but what lacks of storytelling it gains in art, characters and meaning.\n\nThe main characters, Maris and Cantus, are both teenagers (Or around teenagers) and they met by the beachside. After Maris meets Cantus, she realizes hes unhappy and tries to get him to smile. She makes a timeline of 7 days to make him happy. As the story goes on, Cantus starts to question more and more about the girl he met by the beach. (Like \"Why is she always at the beach?\", \"Is she real?\", etc.) but ignores it and always come back to the beach, his favorite place, with his only friend.\n\nSpoiler here:\n\n\nThe ending is the most inpactful. At the end, you (and Cantus) realize that, this girl, is a special vision that Cantus was having to understand more about his family (Mainly, his mother) and how much he realizes they matter to him. Maris, by making Cantus laugh/smile, he realizes how much his mother has helped him through his hard life of a anti-social teen.\n\nAs much as I was confused, I was heartwarmed. Showing how much family matters in a game about a depressed, lonely teen going through his \"edgy\" stage, is all that I wanted in a visual novel.\n\nThe game can be finished in under an hour (or over, depends on your reading speed) but the story stayes with you. I would, and will, recomended this to all my friends.\n", "timestamp_created": 1497050737, "timestamp_updated": 1497050737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32156908": {"recommendationid": "32156908", "author": {"steamid": "76561198337342512", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491941147}, "language": "english", "review": "i enjoy play this game is so much fun and thanks let me play this game is amazing X3", "timestamp_created": 1496509011, "timestamp_updated": 1496509011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32123986": {"recommendationid": "32123986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262852905", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496389078}, "language": "schinese", "review": "emmm\u600e\u4e48\u8bb2\n\u633a\u6cbb\u6108\u7684\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u505a\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u73a9\u73a9\u3002\n\u4e70\u4e86dlc\u624d\u6709cv\u548c\u9690\u85cf\u6545\u4e8b\n\u542c\u7740Cantus\u548cMaris\u7684\u8bed\u8c03\u548c\u8bed\u6c14\uff0c\u60f3\u8d77\u6765\u9ad8\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u8ffd\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5973\u5b69\u5b50\u3002\u5979\u50cfCantus\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u96be\u76f8\u5904\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u559c\u6b22\u548c\u4eba\u4ea4\u5f80\uff0c\u559c\u9759\uff0c\u5bf9\u5979\u5988\u5988\u4e5f\u662fCantus\u4e00\u6837\u8d85\u7ea7\u4e0d\u8010\u70e6\u7684\u8bed\u6c14\u3002\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5c31\u662f\u559c\u6b22\uff0c\u50cfMaris\u4e00\u6837\u5929\u5929\u5f88\u6709\u5143\u6c14\u5730\u53bb\u64a9\u5979\u3002\u4ee5\u540e\u662f\u518d\u4e5f\u89c1\u4e0d\u5230\u4e86\uff0c\u603b\u6709\u79cd\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u662f\u6000\u5ff5\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u3002\n\u770b\u6b63\u7247\u5230Day7\uff0c\u603b\u611f\u89c9\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4f1a\u662f\u611f\u6069\u6559\u80b2\u7247\u5427\uff1f\u770b\u4e86Side Story 1\u624d\u77e5\u9053\u662f[spoiler]\u6bcd\u4eb2\u7684\u8bf7\u6c42[/spoiler]\n\u5173\u4e8eMaris\n[spoiler]\u6b63\u7247\u6700\u540e\u4e5f\u6ca1\u8bf4\u5979\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u3002SIDE STORY 1 \u91ccMaris\u548cCano(Cantus\u5988\u5988)\u8bf4\uff0c\u201c\u4f60\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6240\u6709\u4e8b\u7269\u90fd\u6709\u751f\u547d\u5417\u201d\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u4e86\u5927\u6d77\uff0c\u6211\u662f\u89c9\u5f97Maris\u5176\u5b9e\u662f\u5927\u6d77\u5566w[/spoiler]\nanyway\uff0c10/10\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u5f88\u8d5e\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1496390797, "timestamp_updated": 1496390797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504902", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32072029": {"recommendationid": "32072029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150867458", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496179486}, "language": "english", "review": "(2017 Review :O) This was an amazing, short and sweet, game.

Second, what I was thinking very long about it: Why for such a very long time after Maris met Catus' mother, she goes back again and meets Catus, and why she only said:\"Give me 7 days, I'll make you smile\". Is that limited time for her to make Catus happy, or just like what she has done to his mother. Well, I dont know that, and another thing. Why the author give us 2 choices for every route (also 1 is not positive because it will move to the other options) and the choice: Go find some seashell have 3 seashells, does it mean every seashell is an another route that we can discover. Hmm, having thought about this situation a lot but I can't help anything. Maybe I should start anothers New Game to discover it.\nAnyway.

As such there are a few oddities with it as I am pretty sure it wasn't made with the renpy engine. The controls are a little weird the save load and such are bound to some weird keys, that said you don't have to use them everything is laid out on the screen and I only found myself using the up/down keys for advance and previous.\n\nThe story is nothing special, that being said it's written very well and it's a very sweet story. It is slightly formulaic and predictable but fun none the less. It's free and can be completed in an hour or less so no real risk here. Definitely give it a shot.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1489710206, "timestamp_updated": 1489710206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30479746": {"recommendationid": "30479746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081862874", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 169, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489353127}, "language": "english", "review": "Voices from the Sea Review - Raymond KT\n\n\"The Soundtrack Alone, should make you want to play this game. You won't be dissapointed!\"\n\nSummary: Follow the story of a young boy, Cantus as he meets Maris, the mysterious girl by the sea - an experience that will change his life forever. Collect seashells, unlock hidden Wallpapers, Theaters, and Side Stories as you sit back and enjoy this cute relaxing story. The Free Version was funded by Kickstarter.\n\nVoices from the Sea is a slice-of-life, supernatural visual novel. The game is available in Free and Plus version.\nWhile the game is so short it is easy to see how much the characters grow after each meeting, while the focus is primarily on Cantus and his progress it is still obvious by the end of the game that Maris grows a little too. The game also leaves you guessing about who or what Maris really is, so much mystery surrounds her leaving many aspects of the character's lifestyle to the player's imagination. While Maris leaves people questioning who she is the game still manages to keep much of the focus on Cantus and his daily life. Through much of the beginning it shows static on the screen to give a better idea of how he feels about other people as they talk to him, but when he is around Maris the static is gone and things in his life slowly become clearer as each day with her passes. Another import object in the game that points to how Cantus feels towards other people is the headphones he always has on to keep people from talking to him but there are times throughout the game where he takes them off his ears when he is around Maris. As disappointing as it may be to some players there is absolutely no romance in this game, the game is focused on a friendship between two young 13-year-old teens that results in character growth and this aspect keeps the story more innocent and heartwarming.\nVoices from the Sea is a visual novel that is beautiful in every way from the soundtrack to the characters and turns away from the unsavory and pointless style which is seen in many other titles recently released within the same category, this game is perfect for those who enjoy more heartwarming and beautiful visual novels such as those from developers like Key or stage-nana. Even for anyone that is unsure if they will like the game it is worth a try since it is one of the rare few good visual novels which are offered for free on Steam thanks to the generosity of its developer. The only bad points are that it is short and leaves you wanting more and it is far more linear than many other visual novels, but for those that enjoyed the visual novel Narcissu it may not be a bad thing after all. But you can\u2019t go wrong with a game that has great art, a great story and a beautiful soundtrack that adds atmosphere and deep emotion.\n", "timestamp_created": 1489353204, "timestamp_updated": 1489353204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30463226": {"recommendationid": "30463226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198325899376", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488689871}, "language": "english", "review": "move this game", "timestamp_created": 1489297342, "timestamp_updated": 1489297940, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492346", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30422809": {"recommendationid": "30422809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254251818", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489137323}, "language": "english", "review": "I, really like this game looking forward for your next visual novel bros, :D\n", "timestamp_created": 1489137324, "timestamp_updated": 1489137324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30354031": {"recommendationid": "30354031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042509103", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489142715}, "language": "french", "review": "Cute little game :) (although a bit naive and predictable) Very nice graphics and music as well.\nI'd definitely recommend this game :)", "timestamp_created": 1488798800, "timestamp_updated": 1488798800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461310", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30332446": {"recommendationid": "30332446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135080887", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488704837}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u0430\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430?\n\n- \u0414\u0430!\n\n- \u041f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0430\u043a\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438.", "timestamp_created": 1488703118, "timestamp_updated": 1488703118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506855", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30327341": {"recommendationid": "30327341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104760539", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 82, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488678166}, "language": "english", "review": "Short, but really nice VN.

I am simply reviewing each individual aspect based on my opinion. This allows for my reviews to be spoiler-free. You may find I rate by different categories in each of my reviews. This is because every type of game is different, and will not have the same content. I think it is pointless to leave a category blank or write 'unrelated', or something similar.)\n\n[h1] Game Content: [/h1]\n[b] Type of Game: [/b] Visual novel, anime style, supernatural\n[b] Graphics and Art Style: [/b] **** - Anime style drawings of the characters and beautiful pictures of the sea.\n[b] Music: [/b] **** - The music is lighthearted and really sets the mood of the game. When Cantus is feeling down, the music has a twinge of sadness. When Cantus and Maris are playing around, the music is upbeat. At the end, the music also has a special feeling to it. \n[b] Addictiveness: [/b] (Number of stars is irrelevant) Due to how short the game is, you can complete it in one sitting, but for that short time you are playing, you don\u2019t want to turn away. \n[b] Storyline: [/b] ***** - The storyline is steadily progressive and dynamic, and speaks of the past with resentment, the present with a grudge and the future with a hopeful eye. The story develops as Cantus and Maris\u2019 friendship builds and Cantus lets out more about himself. I won\u2019t spoil it, but the ending is emotional and left me satisfied with a sense of longing for more. This is a visual novel you do not want to miss. \n[b] Character Development: [/b] ***** - You can clearly see the development of the two main characters (Cantus and Maris) as Maris tries again and again each day to help Cantus achieve his happiness, which she eventually succeeds in at the end. You will grow attached to the duo and long for the day they meet again. \n[b] Replay Value: [/b] ** - Not much replayability. It\u2019s a one-time sweet satisfaction, but if you begin to miss Cantus and Maris, you can enjoy their experience once again.\n[b] Collectables: [/b] **** - As I said in a discussion for this game: \u2018Play the whole game, then over again a couple of times to collect all of the seashells. You can hold the down arrow to skip the text and press enter to skip the introduction, and just choose the seashells each time you get the option to. Then, read all of the extra scenes and such, and you will have all of the wallpapers and everything else!\u2019 You collect seashells, and when you have all of them and have completed the game at least once, you unlock extra scenes and gallery pictures. \n[b] Extra Content: [/b] *** - The extra content is short, but very cute. \n\n[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]\n[b] Marks Overall (judged by the mode of the numbers): [/b] ****/***** 9/10\n[b] Who Should Play This Game?: [/b] It\u2019s a relaxing experience good for anybody in my opinion. If you hate sap or emotional games, steer clear of this one. People who enjoy visual novels will love it.\n\n[u] Thank you for reading!

During one of these times, he encounters a mysterious girl about his age, named Maris, that realizes that Cantus has been a little down in the dumps lately. She tasks herself with trying to cheer him up.\n\nThis game is a visual novel, a type of video game entirely story-driven. The main purpose is to tell the story through text and it is more reading than anything else. Despite the visual novel format, the choices in the game do not really matter, other than to see a bit of a different piece of dialogue. Ultimately, the game is rather linear and all choices lead to the same ending. This is definitely on the shorter side by visual novel standards and it should not take an average player much more than forty minutes to complete a play-through.\n\nTo start off with the positive, the art style is rather good with bright colors and attractive scenery, at least for the small amount present in this game. The music, while a little repetitive, was well used.\n\nHowever, nice art and music alone do not make a good visual novel. The meat of any visual novel is the characters and writing neither of which worked well in [i]Voices from the Sea[/i]. To start off with, the two main characters come off as terribly clich\u00e9d. Cantus feels like some angsty teenage stereotype who conflicts with his mother for no justifiable reason and hates school (gasp!). For the short length of this game, he becomes impossible to sympathize with as whatever \"problems\" he seems to have seem petty at best. Maris, on the other hand, plays the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope to a T. Instead of any real character development, her purpose is just to exist for Cantus's sake. Overall, hardly anything happens in the story and the characters are immediately forgettable.\n\nIn conclusion, [i]Voices from the Sea[/i] has some nice art, but the characters and story come off as boring and forgettable.", "timestamp_created": 1484162895, "timestamp_updated": 1486756105, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538007", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29185839": {"recommendationid": "29185839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141668836", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483221384}, "language": "english", "review": "It's free and decently well done", "timestamp_created": 1484151655, "timestamp_updated": 1484151655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29176737": {"recommendationid": "29176737", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092497219", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484111206}, "language": "english", "review": "How lovely..", "timestamp_created": 1484111285, "timestamp_updated": 1484111285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29041683": {"recommendationid": "29041683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198300431783", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483642001}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a pretty short casual visual novel, which took me around 70 mins to finish (probably could've been 30).

I knew just by looking at it that I would be mildly bored by it for it's 40 short minutes of play time, and you know what?\n\nI was right in dreading it.\n\nVoices from the Sea is another interactive Japanese-culture-inspired interactive novel. It follows an angsty boy named... Cantus, who lives on an island and is plagued by all the \"noise\" in his world, like his mom telling him to make more friends, or a kid named Garrio poking fun of him. Honestly, Cantus comes across as a bit of a pr*** in the scenes away from the ocean. Like a moody teenager pouting about how life sucks and no one understands him.\n\nBut, unbeknownst to our unlikeable protagonist, he meets a mysterious girl from the ocean named Maris, who is... just strange. Not really charming or enlightening. Just strange. She tries desperately to make him smile in the 7 days they talk, but all of their scenes are as awkwardly-written as everything else in the game. There are SOME points where they start talking like real people (about, you know, real feelings and relationships instead of angsty bullsh**), but they're soon cut off by the pretentious narration. And the blackout with a sentence-ending to close each day is the icing on the pretentious cake.\n\nThe game does have a little quality put into the backgrounds, but the actual animation and music are just... bland and cheap-looking. Sure, Everlasting Summer is one of my favorite interactive novels and it looks very similar to Voices from the Sea, but it's the story that made Everlasting Summer such an engrossing game. And Voices from the Sea just doesn't have it. A kid is depressed about vague stuff in life, a girl talks to him in some cringey and awkward scenes, and he realizes he loves his mom out of nowhere at the end... even with how sh**ty he's been treating her up to that point. It just doesn't add up. \n\nBut, wait! Voices from the Sea does involve interactivity! REAL interactivity! As in, you can make decisions in this game! Guess what you can choose?\n\nWhat f***ing seashell looks best.\n\nAre you f***ing kidding me? What is this bullsh**? It's not implemented into the story, save for the end, and it's just a mindless bit where you stare at the same blank screen (Even though you might be moving right or left, according to the game) and you just pick a seashell for the day. It has no impact on the plot. It's just there.\n\nVoices from the Sea is as pretentious as it is artless. As I expected, I was mildly bored while playing, but all those little irritating things culminated into an overall unpleasant 40 minutes that I feel were honestly wasted on this bland interactive novel. It might be free, but I heavily recommend you spend your time on an actually well-written interactive novel, like Everlasting Summer. As for Voices from the Sea, I'm giving it a 3/10. There's a little quality here, but it's so bogged down by the rest of the bullsh** in this game, that I cannot see myself playing it again ever.", "timestamp_created": 1476836647, "timestamp_updated": 1476836647, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.399358", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26034964": {"recommendationid": "26034964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197352866", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 74, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455165800}, "language": "spanish", "review": "GENIAL\nBuena trama, musica simple pero perfecta, entretenida, personajes algo interesantes y muy bien artisticamente.\nCorta historia pero muy bien llevada", "timestamp_created": 1476474175, "timestamp_updated": 1476474175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25997426": {"recommendationid": "25997426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312717203", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466563484}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Tra\u00e7o lindo, com uma historia curta mas que realmente te faz refletir e simpatizar com as personagens <3", "timestamp_created": 1476279086, "timestamp_updated": 1476279086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25947239": {"recommendationid": "25947239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105680429", "num_games_owned": 4515, "num_reviews": 514, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476018509}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5c0f\u6e05\u65b0\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u5267\u60c5\u8fd8\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6b64\u6e38\u620f\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u6c49\u5316\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u82f1\u8bed\u4e0d\u597d\u7684\u8bdd\u73a9\u8d77\u6765\u6709\u70b9\u5403\u529b\u4e86\uff0c\u65e0\u804a\u73a9\u73a9\u8fd8\u662f\u86ee\u4e0d\u9519\u7684~", "timestamp_created": 1476018999, "timestamp_updated": 1476018999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563781", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25934768": {"recommendationid": "25934768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150510276", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475963539}, "language": "english", "review": "The art is great and the story is...actually not that bad, even pretty funny at some parts.

She introduces herself as Maris, they continue to talk. Cantus doesn\u0092t understand why this girl is talking to him but he allows her intrusion into his closed world, by the end of this meeting Maris makes Cantus a promise, that she will make Cantus smile.\n\nAs far as the story is concerned Voices from the Sea is a Slice of Life / Drama Visual Novel with a somewhat mysterious tone to it, having bought the game instead of just getting the free version I received the experience the creator had originally envisioned.\n\nAnd wow it is something, this story was so interesting to me that I reread the whole VN several times when I first got it, Im not sure if this will be the same for everyone but it really made me think.\n\nSound wise the music is outstanding the use of music is great and complements both the story and the overall feel of the VN. The only grievance is ultimately the voice acting, and this is understandable and easily forgiven as your drawn into the lives of the characters. \n\nThe Art I find to be very well done and not just the characters, the backgrounds too are visually appealing, the style of the VN is typical anime art, but that is usually what you can expect with a Visual Novel, however somehow and I cant really put it into words, Voices from the Seaeven though yes it uses the same style as many other VN's it defines itself and stands out from the crowd.\n\nVoices from the Sea is a very character-focused VN, length wise it is not the longest I have come across, but it doesn't need to be; it tells its story well in the period of time needed, any longer and the feel would be completely off, as if to make it worse by drawing it out so though some will be disappointed at its short length it is for the best. \n\nOverall Voices from the Sea is beautifully written piece of work; It is visually appealing, the characters are interesting, Cantus's journey is worth investing in, as is finding out more about the mysterious girl Maris.\n\nI'll leave you with this, Voices from the Sea  is a great read and will no doubt keep you interested throughout its duration, and its absolutely free if that's not a good reason to check it out I don't know what is....so Why not give it a try and if you enjoy it I would highly recommend getting Voices from the Sea Plus.\n\n(Like all my reviews I do not put a score as it is my belief that games like all forms of art are subjective and therefore it is impossible to afix a number to them)", "timestamp_created": 1460529021, "timestamp_updated": 1460849161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596978", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22378839": {"recommendationid": "22378839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017167948", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460479322}, "language": "koreana", "review": "better than fallout 4\n\n\n12/10\n\n\n-ign-", "timestamp_created": 1460479453, "timestamp_updated": 1460479453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22370365": {"recommendationid": "22370365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120108631", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460442497}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 -

Cantus meets Maris, the blue haired, mysterious girl. Cantus is a moody introvert, he enjoys being alone, and dislikes human interaction. But that all changes when he meets Maris, the cheerful, always happy, and playful girl by the sea.\n\nCantus regularly visits the beach alone, until he finds Maris, who seems to appear out of nowhere. Maris sparks Cantus' feelings and breaks him out of his emotional shell, his sea shell. :3\n\nThis is a quite shorter visual novel than most, but it has an excellent story, and I found it very appealing. The art of the game is truly stunning in comparison to most 'free-to-play' novels, which really makes this game for me. Each piece of the soundtrack is excellent, and they all fit into their corresponding scene. There are only very few characters, which leaves lots of time to connect with each and everyone, may it be; Cantus, Maris or Cantus' Mother.\n\nThis story should never be spoilt, as the ending will truly break your heart. I was definitely touched, and just had to play through again.

The main player character was in a state of depression, but no real reason was given as to why. Not even a passing comment. The other characters weren't as good either (though the other main character was okay). I saw the ending coming from a mile away. By the in-game Day 2, the game pretty much confirmed the ending I had predicted ever since the first textbox.\nThe choices available in-game were rather limited and didn't impact much on the overall outcome. You only have the option of \"positive\" and \"negative\" and neither of those really changed anything aside from what is said in dialogue. The shell-collecting minigame is also rather lacking and shares the same issues raised above.\nI suppose I can't really complain much since I have a real lack of VN know-how and hey, y'know, it's free (with the exception of the DLC which just adds some stuff onto it).

Free to play, quick download, and a quick \u201cgame\u201d to work through, arguably one of the best \u201cgames\u201d I\u2019ve picked up in the last few weeks. Highly recommend you give this game a go, a truly enthralling tale 8.5/10\n\n[IN-DEPTH REVIEW]\nSo, you are one of those people that is just not sold by my summary? Alright, here is a nice in-depth evaluation.\n\nOddly enough, I found myself searching through the free to play list on Steam, and sorted by popularity. I found this \u201cgame\u201d surprising low, despite how truly amazing it is, for a game of this genre, it is truly great at what it aims to achieve. All that being said let\u2019s get onto actually talking about the game, shall we?\n\nFirst on my checklist is the storyline. The \u201cgame\u201d being a visual novel means that it has to excel in that format, otherwise it is counter-intuitive, and that would be by no means good, would it now? The storyline itself is interesting, and I, for one, can relate. Not to having voices of the sea, but the idea of trying to trap everyone and everything out. The storyline follows a boy by the name of Cantus, not a name I can personally relate to but, is a bit out there, and is part of the reason why I remember it, it isn\u2019t your average Bob, Phil or Vladimir, and by definition makes us as the audience be interested towards the story, maybe in hope to find out the reason of this name. This boy, is distant from society, from people to the objects around him, however, his ears are open the moment he is by the beach, and has a weird thing about liking beaches. He says a little about how he loves the sounds of the waves and how the seashells let him bring the sea home. He then meets someone on the beach, Maris, a girl, who is \u201cslightly\u201d older and she aims to make him smile. The game happens over 7 days, and the prologue, and if you want to know more, you are going to have to play it yourself, I personally will not be the one spoiling it for you.\n\nPlayability, as you may have noticed this \u201cgame\u201d is not really played, it is more of a \u201cgame\u201d where you oversee someone. Because of this factor, the \u201cgame\u201d is being viewed, but you do have to do somethings, but fear not, this is a pick-up and play, you don\u2019t need the controls to know what to do, the visual novel is meant to be watched rather than flat out played, and plays out somewhat in the way similar to Sakura Beach (minus those \u201cnaughty\u201d scenes) and those games, but the net end of the storyline is always there, as far as I know there are no other endings, but as a non-owner of the DLC I can\u2019t vouch for that. But, like I said playability, it\u2019s easy and not really a game you play.\n\nIn terms of re-playability, since it is a visual novel, it is the standard gap in between, you may watch/play it every now and again, due to the memorable parts of the story and/or general love for the game/novel. An unfortunate problem is that, since there is no other endings, as far as my knowledge extends, there are no new experiences to gather, this loses some of the re-playability in my opinion.\n\nThat leads me to my next point, my sole complaint, is that there are no other endings, it really dampened the experience for me visual novels need to have some kind of variation of some kind, otherwise it just gets dull, and the potential fun that lies in replaying a game/novel is lost, because there is nothing else to really experiment with. That being said, the endings isn\u2019t bad, and in fact is quite a nice ending, and day 7 wraps everything up with a nice little bow, and works well for the storyline, but at the end of the day, there just isn\u2019t a new experience to garner from this game, besides getting the DLC (I don\u2019t know about you, but I can\u2019t spend that much) the game kind of gets a slight staleness from playing it again, and could turn you to hate it.\n\nBugs? There are none, not that I can say, good work there Zeiva Inc.\n\nArguably my favourite part of this novel is the graphics. The graphics, are too good to be true for this novel. The amount of time that went into them is so noticeable, the game is so flowing the graphic just go well with the storyline, if I was told to conjure up what the characters looked like from personality alone, they would look something like that (a bit more rough around the edges, I'm no Picasso), due to this I want to give a congratulations to the team for some really good graphics. They fit the tag of Anime very nicely, and I can say with confidence, that this novel is an anime. The silhouettes are also very nicely made, and add up to the feel of the game and just help massively in encasing ourselves into the world of Cantus and Maris. The graphics are so nice, I still remember them at this very moment, and they are so picturesque that it is quite astonishing, they are truly impressive, and immersive, and I love it. Also, it is run using Adobe Flash Player? Why can\u2019t all other flash games/novel look this nice, it just really goes to show just how impressive this game really is.\n\nThe grand finale, music, sound, that lovely bundle of fun, happiness and enjoyment. The music, is just heaven, no joke. It astounds me how great it is, and how it feels part of the storyline, and is not just thrown in just so the design team can say they did something. My word, the music just goes well with the game/novel, it plays a similar role to that of the graphics which lead to the immersion, which I discussed earlier, and is part of the reason why I just keep playing on, and then put the tab open while writing this, because it\u2019s just so peaceful, laid-back and relaxing, and like I already stated the immersion is just there for me, and even you Luke (rumour has it a Star Wars film is coming out, got to appeal to those kind of people)!\n\nJust before I give my closing statement, I want to give a hearty congratulations to the developer on a great visual novel, and that I loved every single minute of my 60 minutes (could change) that I spend playing/watching this game/novel unfold, good work there Zeiva Inc.\n\nSo, to conclude, a heartfelt game full of passion, joy immersion and some great graphics and some catchy tunes alongside it. A truly great game, quite unique and a beautiful tale. If you are still not willing to give this game a go, then maybe you just don\u2019t dig this kind of thing, maybe you are reading this on your phone, maybe you\u2019re on holiday or maybe enjoying the end of school (well, for me) or getting in the Christmas spirit (it\u2019s next week at this point in time), or perhaps you are off to Kazakhstan because, Kazakhstan is cool, no?\n\nSo, in a nutshell, good game, well played. Sorry for any mistakes, I\u2019m not fluent English, if you have any questions, or want me to review a game, add me or drop a comment on this, or my profile. And on that bombshell\u2026\nGoodnight! (maybe it\u2019s morning or afternoon, I don\u2019t use clocks, way too fancy).\n", "timestamp_created": 1450455826, "timestamp_updated": 1450455826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1,

This game. Gods... I have so much to say about it. And it's all good things as well. So here goes nothing.\n\nAlrighty so first off, the art was amazing. From the characters, to the backgrounds, it all looked so nicely done. And I won't lie, I found it pretty cool how at first almost everyone was just a shadowy figure when it was before Cantus went down to the beach to relax. It was a nice detail. The cute little snowmen guys were also a lovely touch. They made me smile a lot and say stuff like \"Aww look at how cute they are\"\n\nNext up is the music, and boy did I love it. I found it very relaxing and it was honestly enjoyable to listen to. And most music in any visual novels don't catch my interest unlike in this game. Usually I just have my iTunes in the background. But when I heard the opening for this game, I honestly felt very relaxed and so I gave it a try, and I really liked it.\n\nNow the story. Oh Odin the story. It was so good! I loved how the characters interacted with each other. I found Maris' efforts to make Cantus happy the cutest thing ever. And the way Cantus reacted to Maris' attempts was also very cute. I also was not expecting the ending. Way too many feels. But... I liked it, they were the good kind of feels. Anyways, on a personal note, and like others have already said, I could connect to this on a personal level as well. Due to being bullied up until this year when I moved to Florida and stuff, it's just really understandable since Cantus wasn't liked by the students either. It also told me that by the end, you just have to grow up, move and, and remember that family will always be there for you until the end. My only complaint though is that I wished the main story was a little longer.\n\nSo yeah.

Seems nice. \nI have no regrets. \n\nIn reality, this is a very short but lovely visual novel that can be completed in about an hour and a half, but my God you'll have so many feels for it, you'll wish it was longer (Mind you the extra unlockable content can add about another 30 minutes or so, but it's still very short nonetheless). \n\nThis is a very short and simple story of this kid named Cantus, and he's a bit of a black sheep because he likes to hang out by the ocean all the time and doesn't want to go off and play video games like any other 13-year-old. He's not exactly the fun-loving type or the talkative type either so he's not apart of a clique of friends to say the least. At first, I thought I'd hate him because he kinda seemed like a bratty loner trying to be emo. But then he slowly changes because he meets a girl named Maris. And Maris is very strange in comparison to Cantus because she is very chipper, cheerful, friendly, easy to get along with, you have no idea where she came from or why she's talking to Cantus, etc. As Cantus hangs out more with Maris, he begins to slowly be more friendly and opens up more. The two have the cutest moments and conversations due to their different personalities, which makes both characters lovable and fascinating to watch and listen to. \n\nOne thing I want to mention as well is the music. I think the whole reason why I put so much time into this visual novel is because of the music. It's so relaxing and soothing, and the tracks, while there isn't a lot of them, it's still a very good soundtrack and they all set the tone for every moment very well. The only gripe about it I can think of is that there's no transition to the music tracks, like no fade in or fade out when the tracks have to change. But that's just nit picking. \n\nThe next thing is the voice acting (Only available in the DLC). While not professional by any means, it's pretty decent. It's nothing groundbreaking but it won't urge you to stab your eardrums. One thing I will say about the voice acting is that when the characters have to be loud, the voice actors don't really shout or raise the volume that much. I understand if the visual novel is meant to be a bit quiet or subdued but there is a certain part of the game when Cantus gets very upset/fed up. When it comes time for a him to express this, he's not very loud about it. I'm not saying you need to be loud in order to vent frustration, but it would make more sense if this was the case since, given you've seen the story up to said point because it's very relatable. \nI also love how every time you get a new sea shell Maris and Cantus always have something different to say about the shell you pick which then branches off into a full conversation, and it all sounds and feels so natural. Except how Maris refers to herself in the third person. I thought I would hate that she did this, but I oddly didn't mind. I mean, Maris was already kinda strange so it makes sense that she would talk weird, but she's also really cute so it didn't really matter in the end. You kinda just accept it as a normal thing.\n\nNow I also want to say things about the art style. It's super cute and even very beautiful. I love the way these characters are drawn, and I also love how blue the sky and water always is. I especially like the last part of the game art-wise because of how the scenery changes. \n\nAlso included in the DLC is a gallery where you can unlock wallpapers to change the image of the title screen. There's also character images and small profiles, a music gallery to the soundtrack, a theatre which unlocks a 3 part little story, and 2 side stories that are both very nice to watch through. Both side stories are only about 10-20 minutes long. \n\nThis visual novel is adorable. \n\nOther than that, Voices from the Sea is an adorable visual novel. The writing is simple and lovely, and if someone can take a simple story and take you on emotional roller coaster in 2 hours, then you're a genius. Granted there's no serious decisions nor multiple endings, but it's still a nice experience. \nIt's just a short and sweet little story to watch if you want to take a break from any serious games or you don't want to do a whole lot of strategy or anything. If you're looking for a story to experience or if you can relate to family issues or school issues without anything heavy, then give it a try.

Unfortunately, however, it fails to capitalize on its almost surreal setting, as its other departments are painfully inadequate. It might be that the game has a very low development budget, and free VNs tend to not be as well-written as the ones you have to pay for, but even then, there are much better examples free VNs for PC out there, like the Narcissu series [Stage-nana 2005], or True Remembrance [Shiba Satomi 2006]. The characterizations, motivations and themes here are much too shallow and generic to be memorable, and there is almost no story or scenario to speak of, whereas in the other examples, while they may not necessarily be the pinnacle of writing, they are unique in their own way.\n\nIf we don't consider only free titles then you get phenomenal works like Ever17 [Kid 2002], Little Busters!

It's funny and also a little sad at some points. \nThe characters are also nicely done with the girl being quite random and Cantus being quite silent/serious.\n\nThe graphics/art style are nicely done, though don't change much, as there is only 1 setting and a few characters.\nStill, they are drawn really nicely and the backgrounds are nicely animated as well.\n\nThe music has the same problem as the graphics. They are wonderful to listen to and really set the mood of the story and characters but there are around 3 songs in total.\n\nVerdict: If you want to read a visual novel with a good story, fun characters in a nicely drawn fashion, this is really for you.

Really, there isn't... I think. Here we go: [b]Snoozefest from the Sea[/b]\n\nMeet Cantus, a reclusive thirteen year old chap. For him, he perceives the motion of life as nothing but a drag, and everything that doesn't constitute remote significance to him is dismissed as \"noise\", and his only passion resides within the virtues of seashells. He refrains from having any unwarranted interactions with other people, even with his own Mom. Overall he views his life devoid of any happiness. What an ass, because you know, God forbid the MC of a visual novel isn't a pretentious snob, right? To be frank, he is by far the most insufferable brat I have witnessed being shown in a game for a while. Though Cantus' views are relatable to [i]some[/i] degree, players like me will not be able fathom how his character got past the scripting stage of development, as I sporadically pulled my hairs in frustration of his unimaginative demeanor in-game. During one decisive day in one of the beaches of our aquatic/tropical setting, he encounters the main plot device of this narrative, Maris. Over the course of a week, she tries to make Cantus' smile at least once with promises that she will do so, and maybe pry open the door of opportunity for him to be a more sociable person. One can consider Maris to be the polar opposite of Cantus, as her exuberant, loquacious nature proves so, and with that said the contrast between these two characters is perhaps the only redeemable aspect about this game other than the art, but practically anyone can construct and recognize contrast between two different entities, so this isn't all that special.\n\nThis narrative in general follows a very linear template. There are 7 days in this game, and for a good 5 or so the player/reader will find themselves following the format of having a momentary mischief with Maris, picking up one of the three seashells, sitting through MC's reminiscence of his early days, rinse and repeat. Perhaps the creators made this monotonous pattern with some sort of intention, but as a result of me being so dense as to not figure out why that is I will propose a certain notion: THERE WAS A BETTER WAY TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS. It must take the most absurd   reasoning to so much as presume that your audience [i]won't[/i] find this redundant. To cap things off, during Cantus' little reflection, the last few words of the day usually appear after the screen's fade to black. For that [spoiler]impact[/spoiler]. It's as if the writers really wanted to impart some sort of idea to me by the end of each of these days, and I have no inhibitions to claim that these guys... [b]tried way too hard[/b].\n\nThis one isn't too much of an issue, but the choice-making features this game brings was also a let-down. There is no bad ending for making the wrong choice, but rather that [i]other[/i] choice can only be made once, to add some extra dialogue, and should the player make that same choice again instead of commencing the daily search of seashells, the MC blatantly denies, DENIES your choice, holding you at an inextricable bind until you make the correct choice that proceeds the plot. It's silly, but at least the choices were there to be made, and honestly the game has the prospect of being worse if there were more than one route.\n\nIn the nitty-gritty of things, it is imperative that a story well expresses it's themes if it wants to have any creditable substance in any form. This is my biggest gripe with this game, as it fails to preserve it's themes of social isolation for the entire game. I wish not to adorn my review with long spoiler bars, so I'll keep it simple. What it does wrong it that it manages to ignore the entire emotional (I use this term lightly) drive of the game, and turns the entire quintessence of the plot on it's side by the end of the reading. This was something I witnessed in a more famous novel, Tomoyo After, and it nettles me to no end. To my interpretation, the entire main idea of the game was turned into a more concrete one just for the sake of players not screaming at their screens saying \"WTF WAS THAT EDGY TRASH?\". I can't stress how disappointed I am by this, just like everything about this game.\n\nIt's free and all, but I implore you, no.

W.O.W!!\nOK, My ADHD has been kicking in something ugly for weeks, and have not been able to realy sit down and get into a game, a few days before this, I was mindlessly running through my \"que\". In two days I racked up over 900+ views! Yup that distracted. \n\nAmong the que was this game. I was thinking about getting into a vidual novel, but did not know what one, so I followed most of them. VOICES FROM THE SEA came up free, so I downloaded it and started it. For a moment, I thought my ADHD was going to steal my time away again, but something made me keep \"clicking\" and reading. Maybe it was because I could related to the boy in the story. Or maybe when I was his age, I wished something like this would have happened. Regardless of the reason, I blocked out the world, and kept reading. \n\nAfter a couple hours, I finished it. The last few minutes had me running for the tissue - as it was one of those rare(for me) moving stories - the emotional climax will hit you fast - the timing was perfect.  You didnt realize it was going to happen until it did. And even though, you might have suspected the ending, it was OK. It was just the way it was supposed to be.\n\nI was so glad this one was free, as it will definately make me take a look at some other visual novels. But I think I might savor the memory of this one for a bit, before I mash it with another story.\n\nWhile the gfx are colorful and \"cute\", the storyline, is very mature (in a matter of speaking), and not the typical visual novel - this one would be good for your children - to make them realize just what they REALLY have in life that is important.\n\nRead it today -\n\nps:\n bring a kleenex box too. :-) \n(-macho guys will need paper towels LOL)\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1428867673, "timestamp_updated": 1428867673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532086", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15326116": {"recommendationid": "15326116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083494358", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 40, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428813334}, "language": "english", "review": "The feels.

I mean here you have this game that is comepletely free and has very positive reviews. On one hand you have a very cute story with very nice art and music, on the other hand though it's very short and it's story doesn't really make that much of an impact compared to other game stories I have came across.\n\nI will admit though that when I saw that this game was funded by Kickstarter I was very wierded out by this. For one thing people actually paid for this to be made? I mentioned that the art was good.... but all you have is small portraits of characters, backgrounds, and a bit of art. I don't think all that is worth 1, 2, $4,509! Now if this all went towards the DLC maybe that would make sense but I have not downloaded the DLC and I don't really plan on it either. What's worse is that if these guys would have waited they probably would have been able to make it easily with the Visual Novel Maker that just recently came out. They possibly could have made this game for about $15 (Or at least the free version, again no exposure to the DLC).\n\nBut I will admit that the game is in fact cute. I liked the story even though it was short and simple. I like the characters and the design they gave them, give me anything thaqt looks like an anime or looks cute and I'll be hooked on it, add free and you got me. The development of Cantis (The main character), while quick, was really good. The interaction between these two characters are really nice as well, Maris and Cantis really make a nice duo. If anything I would like to think of it as a nice slice of life 3 minute anime, like \"I Can't Understand What My Husband is Saying\"..... OK bad example but it's the only one I could think of at the moment to compare it with.\n\nOverall nice game, but I don't think it deserves these 10/10 ratings, I'm thinking more of 7.8/10, maybe an 8/10.

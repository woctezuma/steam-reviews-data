It takes place in a cutesy inoffensive world and the plot is very childlike and easy to understand. What is different about it compared to other Humongous games is you now have the ability to select alternate dialogue options from floating dialogue balloons. This doesn't impact much however but it does make the game feel more like a Saturday morning cartoon show as a result. \n\nIt also has random elements like Freddi Fish and Pajama Sam. Only in Spy Fox it's slightly more involved in that the story branches off a little, and how the story progresses varies from playthrough to playthrough. It's still fairly short and really easy for a point and click adventure game but it does deliver a slight amount of replayability as a result.\n\nIt's a nice game and nice series but it appeals to children best.

Much like Pajama Sam, I had to take off my rose-tinted nostalgia glasses to really look at this game and...\n\n...Yeah, I don't like it as much as I used to.\n\nJust because I have a thumbs down on your favorite childhood game doesn't mean you should instantly dislike my review. I'm going to go into detailed reasons why I don't like Spy Fox as much now. I'm not saying I hate this game, I just don't see it as this incredibly entertaining game anymore, since I'm- you know- an adult.\n\nSpy Fox follows the James Bond parody of... Spy Fox, as he investigates a mysterious Greek island to uncover a secret villain's plot involving stealing... all the milk... then flooding the earth... so the cows get blamed... and then they'll get arrested, which means no more cow milk... then he'll get rich selling goat milk.\n\nWhat the hell?\n\nI understand most people will say, \"It's made for kids!\" to which I reply, \"Why are you making excuses for bad story-telling?\". I like a good deal of movies and video games out there, and  I enjoy just as many products made for children. I like Avatar: The Last Airbender, Spirited Away, and Pajama Sam #1 because they were made for kids, but also had adults in mind while they were making their stories. I never expect the most perfect story ever, but at least some sense of logic would be appreciated.\n\nOn top of that, Spy Fox's voice was very... annoying to me. It didn't bother me as much when I was seven, but now, every time he breaks the game by saying a really dumb pun just immediately makes me sigh and roll my eyes. He's supposed to be charming and witty, but he comes across as the nerd in school who thinks its funny to have your jokes revolve around the same topic or remain the same type of joke.\n\nThe actual gameplay is pretty meh. It's a Humongous game, so you know what's in store. Lots of clicking. But the story remains the same, with only two distinct variations between achieving your final goal, and three random keys to the M.W.D. (Milky Weapon of Destruction) that you'll have to solve one per game.\n\nThat, and there's oftentimes some annoying backtracking. Especially if you want to defeat the Kawk-a-Doodle Foo guy, you have to go ALL the way back to the cafe (Yes, I mispelled C-O-C-K-a-Doodle Foo on purpose. I hate being forcibly censored). If you forget one spy gadget, you have to return to the MobCo base, and grab that gadget in order to advance.\n\nTo me this game, seems significantly less developed than Pajama Sam. I mean, Pajama Sam wasn't perfect, but there was a sense of exploring an entirely new world. It was beautiful to look at and to discover the three missing items in it. In Spy Fox, the island is colored with different greys, tans, and puke greens. It's just not very appealing to look at. And you stay in the city/ocean/secret base almost the whole game. The only time you get to see more of the island is when you're driving, and even then it's not much.\n\nPajama Sam also had structure to it, but it was flexible enough for there to be nine different variations of games. Spy Fox has about six. Again, not a big deal, but it feels severely more limited when the only difference between playthroughs is whether you go out to sea or drive, and which key you'll be grabbing this time. It doesn't feel like I'm a spy. It feels like I'm going through the motions. And that might be because I've beaten this game a ton as a kid.\n\nBesides that, there are plenty of good things in this game. There's tons of little references to James Bond and even a ton of things that have nothing to do with spies. Fox says, \"Penny, I've got your number!\" at one point, which I thought was cute. The actual animals living in this world stick out a lot and are both very well-drawn and colored. You can tell that two different people worked on the backgrounds and characters- or perhaps it was the same guy with two different ideas in mind.\n\nThat, and I like the gadget and question system. Being able to hold onto 4 gadget at a time for whatever might pop up is really practical, as is gathering questions about characters and asking people about them.\n\nPlus, the game does a good job at making you feel like a spy. From playing \"Go Fish!\", to arming a missile system to blow up a door, to laser-cutting through a door- the game makes sure you feel like a secret agent on a mission.\n\nBut, you know, for kids. Whatever.\n\nWhile its charm has worn on me, it certainly hasn't for the rabid Humongous fans out there. I still enjoyed playing through it, but I just feel like it's not as good as how I remember it. I do remember having much fonder memories of Spy Fox 3, and we'll see if that still carries. But my final score for Spy Fox in Dry Cereal is a 5/10.

A great sense of nostalgia and a whole lot of fun.\n\nPros:\n1.Puzzles were always interesting. Whether you were knockin aligators unconcious with the power of food or solving lazer-mirror puzzles they were always fun. As a teen now with a little bit of rememberance puzzles were easier but still fun.\n2.Interesting gameplay mechanics. One aspect of the game was interrogating characters about other characters for information. Timed minigames were also thrown in causing some trouble to even the older of players. Gadgets are interesting and fun.\n3.There are 2 endings. I've only completed one as of now. So I'll be back after completing the rest of the series again.\n4.Humor. There are lots of puns, jokes, and James Bond references of which I was quite fond of. Also WANNA SEE MY TATTOO\n\nCons:\n1: Go Fish. Really the only con. Go Fish was one of the minigames. Basically I bought a Jar of Trinkets and used them to gamble with this fat pig. We had to play Go Fish. I swear that pig had a dwarf hiding in the one sided mirror disco ball feeding him info on my card stack with a earpiece. Either that or he was psychic. Too many frustrating tries came out of this. Also guess what your reward is. Nothing. You get jack shit! It was supposed to be a fun minigame but it was not fun. So if you play this game. Stay away from the fucking pig. There's no point to deal with annoyance. Edit: Nevermind what I said. You have to beat him in one of the paths. \n\nStory:\nThis time Spy Fox is up against William The Kid. He's a goat who wants to steal all the cow milk right from their udders. \nHow does he plan to carry this heinous deed out?\nWell first he kidnaps Mr. Udderly, a cow that milks cows for milk... What the fuck mate. That's like me farming woman's tits for milk so I can sell it to lil kids. Oh shit I think that is a real thing.\nAnyway he then plans to flood the world with all the milk so that he can send out tsunamis of the milk onto the world to kill everyone.\nThen he'll point his finger at the cows blaming them for it so they end up in jail. These cows will have to deal with Prison Rape for the rest of their lives. Taking it in the backside in Alcatraz for an eternity.\nThen he'll make everyone drink goat's milk. Which honestly the last part doesn't sound half bad. I quite like Goat Cheese. \nAnyway like usual you and your fursona: Spy Fox have to stop him.\nTo do so we must turn of his Milky Weapon Of Destruction (Sounds like a killer name for a dick. Kappa.), free the cows, and throw this goat bitch into Alcatraz!\nIt's fun. \nPlay it especially if you played it as a child and are looking for a nostalgasm.

With an arsenal of gadgets and a band of allies, Fox is likely to prevail in his mission. Spoofing on spy thrillers have been done countless times for games, shows, and movies. However this game is really enjoyable with the humor and each character having a unique personality prevents this game from being dull. If you love the Pajama Sam games, this one is a must have.

With games like 'Spy Fox in 'Dry Cereal'' it's not too hard to see why.  I confess this game sure rocked my childhood too, something about it was just perfect for my prepubescent mind.  Recently I was gifted this game and I had the opportunity to play it again, a bit out of the target demographic, but oh well, who really pays much attention to that anyway.  I thought maybe it might've become dated and dull as the decades passed by, but wow was I mistaken.  The game holds up really well today, surprisingly well, even.  It is dripping with it's own unique, unmistakable style (Humongous Entertainment seems to be good at that).  And well, in short, it is just a really entertaining game, I think modern game makers seem to forget that with the push for realistic graphics.  \n\nStory wise, Spy Fox is silly and simple, but all the basic elements are there and it never falters in its zany pace.  You can tell from the title alone that it is probably a spoof of Bond-like espionage films/games, and that's exactly what it is!  You play as Spy Fox, who probably could have been renammed sly fox because of his sheer, suave cunning, he has a bit of an ego, but it all just adds to the charm.  He works at a spy agency with Monkeypenny (a monkey) and Professor Quack (no prises for guessing what species he is).  The plot is kickstarted when, on a food tray, a tv screen tells how all the cows are being captured thus meaing no milk thus meaning everyone is left with 'dry cereal'.  In this crazy, anthropomorhic world, that's really all you need.  \n\nGameplay-wise, the point-and-click appraoch works smoothly, and it's always fun to see just how strange and bizarre the results could be for clicking in random areas.  One neat thing about this series (and the other series in HG's lineup) is the element of replayablilty, when you finish the game through one lot of paths you play again to go through an entirely different set, different puzzles to muck about with, different areas, and even the endings confronting antagonist William the Kid are different too, so you do feel these changes are having some sort of impact.  Nothing is too difficult and there is always advice from either Spy's watch or spy himself if you do ever happen to get stuck.  The only annoying puzzle I came across was the 'go-fish' game with the pig, hated his smug look so much when he was winning and it was so satisfying to wipe that smugness right of his face when you do get to beat him.  There's a little time-waster mini-game on Spy's watch too, which was okay, didn't really play around with it too much.  \n\nMusic was all decent too, did it's job in the game, but I wouldn't really listen to it outside of that.\n\nDesign and setting are where this game shines.  I really love the sharp style of the world which is all consistant.  It might not be perfect graphics-wise, but I'd still say it's pleasing to look at.  Almost like a saturday-morning cartoon in game form.  \n\nIn all I'd probably give this an 8/10, I had way too much fun out of this to dare give it anything lower, and a 10/10 for would definately give it to my kids to play someday.", "timestamp_created": 1436023460, "timestamp_updated": 1436023460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501247", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16628756": {"recommendationid": "16628756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037690813", "num_games_owned": 386, "num_reviews": 240, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435001328}, "language": "german", "review": "Mein wohl Alltime Favourite Advanture Game!\n\nSoviel Nostalgie, soviel positive Energie, die getriggert wird, wenn ich dieses Spiele spiele.", "timestamp_created": 1435001319, "timestamp_updated": 1435001319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16552182": {"recommendationid": "16552182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114592069", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434974032}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't even played this game yet and I know its the best game ever. 9001/12 on ign.

Brecher hat einen diabolischen Plan. Als Oberhaupt der Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Ziegenmilch hat er alle Milchk\u00fche der Welt gefangengenommen um das Milchmonopol zu erhalten. Au\u00dferdem plant er mit einer rie\u00dfigen Sauermilchbombe aus Kuhmilch die Hauptstadt zu \u00fcberschwemmen und diese Tat dann den armen K\u00fchen in die Schuhe zu schieben. Doch er hat die Rechnung ohne Agent Fuchs gemacht, der sich sofort auf den Weg macht um diese Katastrophe zu stoppen.\nEine d\u00fcmmere Geschichte h\u00e4tte man sich wohl nicht ausdenken k\u00f6nnen, aber gerade das macht Spy Fox in Dry Cereal gerade so sympathisch. Das sch\u00f6ne daran ist, dass die Story nach dem Anfang 3 verschiedene Richtungen nehmen kann, die zwar alle zu dem selben Ende f\u00fchren, aber durchaus etwas Abwechslung in die Sache bringen. So gilt es zum Entsch\u00e4rfen der Bombe entweder einen Schl\u00fcssel, eine Lochkarte oder ein Batteriedinges zu finden, welche jeweils an anderen Orten versteckt sind. Kleiner \"Spoiler\": Um das \"richtige\" Ende zu bekommen muss man gegen Ende nochmal flink sein und aufpassen.\n\nGameplay:\nEin Point and Click Adventure wie es im Buche steht, denn mehr als eine Maus braucht man nicht. Man klickt Personen an um mit ihnen zu reden, benutzt Pfeile am Bildschirmrand um sich zu bewegen und h\u00e4mmert wie wahnsinnig auf Objekten herum, um sich \u00fcber f\u00fcr Kinder durchaus unterhlatsame Spa\u00dfanimationen lustig zu machen. Das ganze l\u00e4uft fl\u00fcssig, ist zwar ein alter Hut, funktioniert aber gut.\nDie R\u00e4tsel die es zu l\u00f6sen gilt kann man kaum als solche bezeichnen, da die meisten ohne den richtigen Hinweis nicht und mit dem \"Hinweis\" zu 100% zu l\u00f6sen sind. Allerdings gibt es ein paar Klickpasagen, in denen es auf das richtige Timing ankommt.\n\nPr\u00e4sentation:\nDas ganze Spiel ist herrlich bunt und wird an verschiedenen Locations mit unterschiedlichen Musikst\u00fccken in Endloschleife untermalt. Die Characktere stammen alle aus dem Tierreich und besitzen jeweils eine eigene (auch deutsche ) Synchronstimme, die zwar nicht das beste ist, was man je geh\u00f6rt hat, aber trotzdem passend ist. \nZudem besitzt das Spiel einen kindgerechten aber recht flachen Humor, der teilweise mit so schlechten Wortspielen um sich wirft, dass es schon wieder lustig ist.\n\nFazit:\nWenn man bedenkt, dass dieses Spiel eigentlich f\u00fcr Kinder gemacht wurde, darf man als nun Erwachsener wohl nicht allzuviel erwarten, doch hat es Spy Fox geschafft sich so sehr in mein Ged\u00e4chtnis zu brennen, dass ich es mir nun auf Steam gekauft habe. Der Nostalgiefaktor war bei mir enorm gro\u00df und deshalb kann ich es mit gutem Gewissen all denen empfehlen, die damals dieses Spiel ( oder andere wie Pyjama Sam oder Putt Putt ) geliebt haben.\nAllerdings sollten erwachsene Spieler wohl einen Sale abwarten, da sie f\u00fcr den vollen Preis ein etwas zu einfaches Point & Click Adventure bekommen w\u00fcrden, das allerdings sogar 2 Minispiele beinhaltet, die doch recht unterhaltsam sind.\nVon welchem anderen Spiel kann man denn sonst behaupten, man habe mit einem Schwein namens Speckschwart in einem Jazzclub eine Partie Quartett um ein St\u00fcck Krimskrams gespielt?\n\nNominiert von mir f\u00fcr einen Steamaward ~", "timestamp_created": 1418505711, "timestamp_updated": 1480038327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.658075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13350267": {"recommendationid": "13350267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067543654", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418498473}, "language": "english", "review": "If you have never heard of this, then you had a terrible childhood.

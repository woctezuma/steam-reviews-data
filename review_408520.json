Purchased it when it was on sale, but even at full price the game is worth it.\n\nIf you like puzzles and enjoyed \u2018The Room\u2019 series you should enjoy this game.\n", "timestamp_created": 1504190924, "timestamp_updated": 1504190924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34620014": {"recommendationid": "34620014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012842435", "num_games_owned": 869, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511217156}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow!

Yes, this is a short game. A very short game in fact. Maybe an hour playthough if you take your time. But... it was an amazing hour! It feels like you have entered an alien mothership, and you're attempting to communicate with its primary entity through logic puzzles and sound. A test of human understanding. Absolutely wonderful.\n\nPROS -\n- The sound design in this game is phenomenal! So many VR games lack quality sound design, but not this one. This one sounds like you are standing in a futuristic cavern. Every completion is met with a satisfying BWAH! \n- Graphics are top quality. The design asthetic is meant to be futuristic, and I agree with all the choices made in terms of style and look.\n- You can tell that the development team put love into this title, This game is POLISHED.\n- Gameplay is surprisingly intuitive, and not glitchy at all. I experienced no dropped frames, no jutter, nothing. Despite the awesomeness of what was happening around me, it still ran wonderfully. And I'm only rocking an AMD Fx8350 and a GTX 1070.\n- Have your family try it to add replay value. I can't imagine anyone over the age of fourty not being completely blown away.\n\nCONS -\n- Duration. However, I would rather enjoy a rock solid hour of awesome, instead of sit through six hours of crap.\n- Price. Although I do think the price is justified due to the amount of time the developers have obviously put into their product, I think full price would have been a little too much (I got it on sale). Still worth it though. \n- The puzzle were pretty easy. Yes, I figured out all the puzzles in an hour, but the way the puzzles work and fit together is fantastic. It all feels interconnected.\n\nI would certainly recommend this game if you want a smooth, beautiful, sci-fi experience.

This is a beautiful game, with amazing sound design. I was really caught off guard and wasn't expecting something as polished as this is. Right from the beginning, I knew the developers were not hacks. I was a little confused as to what was going on and what I was supposed to do, but once I got through the intro bit, it's clear as day. Everything before me was a puzzle, and they are unique. A lot of puzzle games have one mechanic that just becomes more complicated as time progresses. This is not the case wih FORM. I will say that the puzzles aren't that hard, but being completely stumped for an hour on one puzzle in VR is not an ideal experience, so I was happy to progress without pulling all of my hair out.\n\nI completed the game in about an hour, and I am sure lots of people will complain that it is too short for the purchase price. Everyone has their own threshold for what they can pay, but in my eyes, the $15 was well worth it.

Such a beautiful puzzle game that nails roomscale VR. You operate massive hyper-detailed machinery that transforms right in front of you. The puzzles are somewhat abstract, but do a great job teaching you wordlessly as they react. For example if there's an object that needs to go in a socket, the socket will be reaching out to the object as you move it closers. The audio is also excellent, with each tiny detail scrubbing through satisfying clicks and clacks as you twist things in to place.\n\nThere's a tiny story that holds it together. It's well voice and has a nice mix of humor and drama, but it's sets the stage for all the abstract stuff at least existing relative to Earth. Mostly it's like Out of this World or Contact or The Room where you're the scientist transported to another dimension.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that some areas of the game frequently drop frames.

Puzzles felt mysteriously intuitive, despite having to do some really weird stuff to solve some of them.  There was only really one puzzle that I didn't care for, but it wasn't awful or anything, just not as outlandish and creative as the others.\n\nSound design and score is powerful, chilling stuff, really selling the whole sacred alien revelation thing.  It really felt like the trippiest moments of Contact or Close Encounters.\n\nLastly, great use of VR!  Lots of intuitive grabbing, pullling, switching, aiming, peeking... none of this would have worked in a traditional game.  It avoids locomotion problems by having puzzles evolve around you, keeping everything in roomscale reach.  Some scripted teleportation occurs, but it all makes sense within the narrative.\n\nI think this might be my favourite VR title so far this year.

In terms of presentation it's easily top tier out of all the VR experiences I've tried.\n\nOn the other hand it's 50 minutes long and none of the puzzles are challenging in the least. There's no replayability either, since it's a completely linear experience. As such I definatly do not think it's worth \u00a310.99. I know distilling a recommendation down to a gameplay/cash ratio isn't usually a good idea, but 50 minutes for 10.99 just doesn't stack up well against other VR things I've tried. \n\nThat being said I'm going to thumb it up anyway.

W\u00e4hrend der Untersuchung werden wir in den Obelisken gesogen und befinden uns in einer Art Traumwelt. Dieser gilt es nun zu entkommen, indem wir verschiedene R\u00e4tsel l\u00f6sen.\nUnd das ist wirklich toll umgesetzt. \nDie R\u00e4tsel selbst sind relativ einfach, aber das macht auch nicht den Reiz des Spieles aus. Es ist die Welt um uns herum, die so faszinierend und einfach nur optisch gut umgesetzt ist. \nDas Bedienen der verschiedenen Elemente des Spiels l\u00e4uft sehr gut, Fortbewegung ist nicht vorgesehen.\nUm einen entfernteren Gegenstand zu bekommen, benutzen wir telekinetische F\u00e4higkeiten, mit denen wir die Objekte zu uns ziehen. Hebel und andere Ger\u00e4tschaften bedienen wir mit der Hand.\nDas Spiel ist komplett in englischer Sprache, aber zum L\u00f6sen der R\u00e4tsel ist das kein gr\u00f6\u00dferes Problem. Lediglich die Story verpasst man so, ist aber zu vernachl\u00e4ssigen.\nIch selbst habe das Spiel in einem Rutsch durchgespielt, und war von der Welt von Form begeistert. Leider ist das Spiel mit ca 80 Minuten nicht sonderlich lang, ich h\u00e4tte auch ohne Probleme weitere Stunden dort verbringen k\u00f6nnen.\nEinen gro\u00dfen Wiederspielwert sehe ich nicht. Es gibt zwar noch einen \"Bonusraum\" in dem wir Musizieren k\u00f6nnen, aber das war es dann auch.\nTrotzdem gebe ich eine Kaufempfehlung ab, weil das Spiel einfach unglaublich gut aussieht und intuitiv zu Handhaben ist. \nMir hat es sehr viel Spa\u00df gemacht, die Effekte waren toll und die R\u00e4tsel, wenn auch nicht schwer, sehr interessant.\n\nGru\u00df Ziffi\nZiffi\u00b4s Spieletipps als Kurator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/5837414/", "timestamp_created": 1519324868, "timestamp_updated": 1519375020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40266263": {"recommendationid": "40266263", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985546977", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519179781}, "language": "english", "review": "This was one of my most favorite vr experiences ever.

However, it does not only have one of the best game designs I have ever seen, but also it showcases awesome puzzles that will make your mind blow in many ways.\n\nFirst of all, FORM is an art masterpiece. Everything you see once you finish the starting zone is astonishingly beautiful. I love abstract concepts, from Quantum Mechanics to impossible shapes, and this game made me speechless with its sheer design and beautifulness. Everything is represented by geometrical constructs that will bend in front of you in ways you had never imagined, breaking your classical concept of reality.\n\nSound is also pretty amazing. I found myself having eargasms in many moments of this game (especially on the chord tuning puzzle, completing each iteration gave me pure goosebumps in a positive way). Also, this game SHOULD be played with earphones/Deluxe Audio Strap to maximize its immersion factor. The atmosphere and the sound effects will transport you inside this abstract reality like no other game.\n\nGameplay wise, and as I said before, it is one of the best VR puzzle games out there. Its puzzles reminded me of those found on FRACT OSC: Very abstract components that will not make much sense by themselves, but combined with other ones their purpose gets revealed. Their apparent simplicity will fade out as you unfold polygons and rearrange complex metal structures in order to solve small riddles that will sum parts of a much bigger puzzle. This, combined with a simple yet deep argument makes FORM one of those VR experiences that should be played.\n\nFORM left me wanting more. I really hope Charm Games create a bigger, more advanced version of this surreal, yet beautiful and challenging universe. I totally recommend this game! However, it might be expensive for its current amount of content (15\u20ac for a 1h experience is a bit overpricey, even it being as awesome as FORM is), so I also recommend getting it on a sale!", "timestamp_created": 1517873865, "timestamp_updated": 1517878290, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39875683": {"recommendationid": "39875683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021612639", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517866017}, "language": "german", "review": "Gut gemacht, aber f\u00fcr das Geld zu kurz.", "timestamp_created": 1517868656, "timestamp_updated": 1517868656, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39869483": {"recommendationid": "39869483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006294938", "num_games_owned": 1023, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517743051}, "language": "english", "review": "Le f. is this? \nThis is an abstract puzzler of sorts. Supposed to represent a contact with an alien artifact, and a journey of mind, I suppose. \n\nWell, does it? \nIt tries, but it does a very crappy job of it. \n\nWhy? \nThe puzzles are only engaging because they're very easy and you literally can't get stuck at them. The writing is too cliched and isn't fun or interesting at all. Also, I believe, the story doesn't arrive to any kind of resolution whatsoever. \n[spoiler]At the end of my game a humanoid figure appeared and said that I, the smart scientist, can't really comprehend the mystery of the mysterious alien obelisk, despite me sucessfully solving those primary school puzzles for an hour. Then the end credits rolled. Yay for the triumph of scientific method over mysteries of life, huh.[/spoiler]\n\nIs it all bad? \nWelp, pretty much. Everybody praises the visuals, but they didn't impress me at all. The locations weren't interesting, the mechanism design was too eagerly trying to seem alien instead of genuinely feeling like something alien, and it didn't use VR's immersion to achieve anything interesting whatsoever. I wouldn't say it's BAD bad, though, but it's really, really bland and boring. \n\nGimme an example!\nOk. Throughout the game you can pick up globes with letters that are supposed to visualize your, a genious scientist's, thoughts. They're not much more scientific than 'Where am I? What is this?'.\n\nHow about you shut up and stop this blasphemy?\nOk. Bottom line - go play I Expect You to Die for cool easy VR puzzles. Go play The Room for cute easy non-VR puzzles.

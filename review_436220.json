Probably more than any other VR game I've played. Something about the survival mode kept me coming back. It might have been that the top score on the global leaderboard seemed within reach but I actually think it has more to do with one element this shooter doesn't have that many similar Vive titles do: it doesn't tangle your cable up. There are so many great room-scale shooters out there but after playing them for a while the damn Vive cable gets tangled into knots. With this game the action mostly happens in front of you so you're not constantly turning to hit things coming from behind. This might seem like a negative, as it makes the game less intense, but it makes definite sense in the real world. Also its simplicity actually works in its favour as it a nice first step into VR shooters and a good game for friends to experience if it is their first time in VR.\n\nThe game is a steal at its full price and I've had as much fun playing this as any other wave shooter VR game. I'm not going to argue and say it's the best of its kind, but when you take into consideration the price and the fun factor its well worth a purchase. I've left my original review below in case you are interested in what I thought of the game after the first half an hour.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\n\nOnly had a couple of goes on this game and I've had my money's worth already. At \u00a33.99 I think this game is great value. The sense of immersion is wonderful and I really felt like I was standing on that platform blasting all those ships and orbs whizzing past. The only negative was that the guns weren't quite as accurate as I would have liked but I read, after quiting the game, that the gun angle can be adjusted, so I'll make sure to do that next time I load up the game.\n\nMy thanks go out to Futuretown for making one of my first experiences in VR so enjoyable.

Actually, there's way more game modes so I guess there's more potential here.  It could use some more polish for sure. \n\nBasically, you're put on a floating platform in a \"space\" kind of environment surrounded by a series of blue portals (not like the ones from the Game portal though).  Each of these portals can spawn enemies and also provide a way for enemies to exit the area.  Once again you've got two guns with different firing modes, but no shield this time. \n\nEach gun has only two modes... a precision laser and a plasma firing pistol.  The gun sights are big and thus easier to see to aim as well. The difference here between this game and SPT is that you have a finite amount of ammo and you have to aim downward to reload (like the old arcade light gun games).   SPT handled this by giving your weapons a \"battery\" that slowly recharged as you stopped firing so you never had to stop and reload.  Reloading takes the focus off the action, though to be fair, waiting for a slow recharge is worse (when your weapon is down to zero charge).\n\nAnyway, it's still fun, but it feels more like target practice than defending a point.\n\nThings I liked about this game: \n[list]\n [*] It's like the light gun games of the late 80's and 90's.\n [*] The gun sights are actually worth using in this game (I guess they're bigger and that helps)\n [*] There's powerups that do stuff like add bonus points and slows time down\n [*] Game modes include Survival mode, Time Attack, Practice and Attack mode (where they actually shoot back)\n[/list]\n\nThings I didn't really like:\n[list]\n [*] Music wasn't memorable\n [*] I'm not a fan of having to reload, especially when one gun only gets 10 shots and the other gets 30.  \n [*] this game has more going on behind you than SPT did, so you may find yourself twisted up in the cable as you turn around and around.\n [*] For the most part, the action was a lot slower in this game so it took a lot longer to build up to excitement.\n[/list]\n\nIt's still a fun game, but if you had to pick between this game and Space Pirate Trainer, I'd say get Space Pirate Trainer.", "timestamp_created": 1467434475, "timestamp_updated": 1467434517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669361", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23977722": {"recommendationid": "23977722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055185268", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467312122}, "language": "english", "review": "For the price this is an absolute no brainer.

Grabbed it in Steam summer sale and compared to other VR games the game is very low priced for what you get. \n\nI own Space Pirates as well and I like the graphics in A-10VR even more. However, when it comes to gameplay, still Space Pirates is more fun for me. The reason is simple: A-10 VR gets too fast too difficult! Enemies come from all sides and are very fast, which is ok with only a few of them at the same time, but after 2 - 3 minutes playtime, it is getting very chaotic and confusing. I feel it is not even possible to kill all the drones on screen, as the weapons have not enough ammo and the (cool) reload function takes a second or so, as you have to lower the gun and then aim back. Drones are popping up way quicker than I can kill them.\n\nI would recommend different difficulty settings with either less drones simultaneously or simply a reduced game speed on \"Easy mode\". In addition it would be better if not so many enemies pop up as the level continues, but the enemies get harder, so one can play a bit more strategic.\n\nHowever, still the positive points are much more than the negative ones, so i do not regret the purchase at all and hope the developers will tune the gameplay a bit and offer some kind of optional casual difficulty level. Currently it is tending to get frustrating when after every 3 minutes a game over pops up. I play shooters since many years and I am not bad playing most of them in hard difficulty, but it is simply much quicker to aim with a mouse than with the whole body & arm. \n", "timestamp_created": 1466862007, "timestamp_updated": 1466862007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500050", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23779177": {"recommendationid": "23779177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308481584", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468132837}, "language": "english", "review": "Well worth the money.

When things get out of hand (and they do, oh boy they do) spray and pray with the plasma gun.\n\nIts a simple game with no story and very little depth, but for the same price as a pint this is amazing value for money. Well done dev for putting a realistic price on your title. And well done for making something that is polished and perfectly playable.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1460488000, "timestamp_updated": 1460488000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629821", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22281200": {"recommendationid": "22281200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020700277", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458332180}, "language": "english", "review": "An extremely underrated gem. For all of the love arcade style games like Xortex and Space Pirate Trainer have gotten, I cannot believe that A-10 isn't more popular. A-10 is a great shooter that isn't quite like any of the other VRcade games I've played thus far, yet still very intuitive and comfortable. Given the super low price point for a very replayable game, I would say everyone should pick it up, play it with their friends, and start battling for the highest score.", "timestamp_created": 1460015299, "timestamp_updated": 1460015299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661640", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 132, "total_negative": 7, "total_reviews": 139}}

Whether that\u2019s praise for the game or a burn for VR, it doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that it\u2019s great even without it.  However, it\u2019s probably fair to say that the newly crafted Unreal-Engine-based portion (Area X) that was added in this release is the thing I\u2019d most want to experience with that fully 3D perspective.  While both the original game and Area X are great, the original game and its extra modes make up the bulk of what is generally fairly limited overall gameplay.\n\n[h1]The \u2018Original\u2019 Spectacle of Visuals and Music[/h1]\n\nOk, so maybe Rez wasn\u2019t the first game to embrace the idea of gameplay that combined visuals and music, but it certainly did it in unique way that even today has few comparative titles.  At its core it\u2019s a simple rail shooter that has you moving a cursor around the screen to lock on to enemies and their weak points (up to eight at a time) and firing off projectiles to take them out.  The thing that set it apart from similarly designed arcade rail shooters was a powerful onslaught of colors and designs in a sort of graffiti style as you flew by.  This combined with the seemingly magical way that your shots would synchronize with the game\u2019s purpose-made soundtrack to make an experience that was completely unlike anything out there at the time on the Dreamcast or Playstation 2.\n\nAfter the initial re-release of the game in HD on the Xbox 360, it finally came to PC with the addition of the aforementioned \u201cArea X\u201d added.  This version has all of the original gameplay with higher resolutions and 3D audio.  Area X uses the some of the same mechanics from the original game such as locking on to enemies with a cursor to fire off shots, but differs by removing the rails and allowing the player to move forward and backward at will while steering and aiming the character.  This presents a very distinct feel in the gameplay (that is hampered by the odd default controls) which gives a clear impression that you are playing something new, but still feels well within the Rez universe.  On top of that, the massive leap in visuals and the addition of heavily layered backing songs made for some downright jaw dropping moments of visual and auditory grandeur. \n\n[h1]Short, but Sweet[/h1]\n\nSince the core game of Rez has only five main levels, it\u2019s possible, if not probable, that you will finish the main part of the game in under a couple of hours.  In addition, much of the game was very easy, especially when using the mouse as your controls as I don\u2019t believe it was designed for such dexterity.  It can feel particularly disappointing given the $25 base price tag.  However, Rez does have a number of challenge-based unlocks and some additional items that you can do after beating the game.  It even has high score options for each level that you can compare with other players and your friends on the scoreboard.   The difficulty does also ramp up toward the end (perhaps to its detriment) as the last level is much longer when including the final boss fight with its many stages.  I\u2019ve read that this may be a result of the game\u2019s hidden dynamic difficulty system, but since it\u2019s hidden I can\u2019t really say if anything was actually different.\n\n [h1]An Experience Worthy of Experiencing[/h1]\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to describe Rez Infinite as anything more or less than just a raw \u201cexperience.\u201d  For all that I got out of it playing on my regular ol\u2019 2D monitor, I believe I\u2019d get ten times more trying it out in VR.  Just sitting a few feet from my screen with my headphones on, I was still completely engrossed in the visuals and the musical interaction \u2013 even without a (probably awkward) secondary controller to make use of the game\u2019s \u201cTrance Vibrator\u201d functionality that is supposed to vibrate with the beat of the music.  I can only imagine how intense the full experience would be in VR.  Yet, without even seeing it in VR, I have to recommend this based solely on what I *could* do, and to me it seemed well worth it from start to finish.  But without a doubt if you have the VR equipment available, this is a must-buy to make use of that investment.  I will say that the price does seem a bit high for the amount of content even including the extra stuff and replayability though, so I also suggest getting Rez Infinite on sale since it\u2019s already coming down in price fairly regularly.  \n\nIf you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28346672-Endyo-Gaming/\n", "timestamp_created": 1515538580, "timestamp_updated": 1515538580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39185064": {"recommendationid": "39185064", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979752834", "num_games_owned": 713, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 90, "last_played": 1515856888}, "language": "english", "review": "A transcendent experience, especially when played in VR", "timestamp_created": 1515427766, "timestamp_updated": 1515427766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39097616": {"recommendationid": "39097616", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995467193", "num_games_owned": 584, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515188030}, "language": "english", "review": "I like it.", "timestamp_created": 1515188101, "timestamp_updated": 1515188101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39096634": {"recommendationid": "39096634", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987500240", "num_games_owned": 649, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 112, "last_played": 1515970314}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't say enough good things about Rez. \n\nI've played every iteration of this game and still enjoy coming back to see how much better it's gotten, as well as any tweaks that've changed over time. \n\nRez is a great rail shooter, the music is diverse and awesome electronica, and the unlocks you achieve for your efforts are interesting additions. \n\nI don't have a VR setup at the time of writing this but I can imagine you'd be able to swim in the sensations of the music and gameplay.

In fact, i had never even heard of it until the PS VR announcement, which got so many people excited. I decided to check it out because of the crazy neon graphics and the fact that I hadn't played what i thought would be a fun simple shooter in a long time. \nRez Infinite in VR amazed me. It's honestly probably the most psychedellic sober experience you could ever have. The controls are amazing, the music is great, the level design, artwork and story (as intentionally light and vague as it is) are all great and the way they work together (the music with the gameplay+ The atmosphere the graphics and music create together) are great. \nThis game legitimately made me sit down and contemplate the origin of existence while also making me want to continue to shoot cool virus robots until i couldn't see. I had fun, and it made me think. That might not sound like a lot, but it's rare for a game this obscure and cheap to actually affect me in this way.\nFor the  main game, i'd say 9 or 10 out of 10. Definitely buy and play in VR.\n\noutside of the main story, there's also a new \"area x\" developed by the porters of the reboot, and its...different. But pretty good. I didn't think the music was as fitting in area x as the rest of the main game, and the transition from On Rails Shooting in the original game to free user controlled flight in this one was dissorienting at first, but pretty fine and fun by the end. It just didn't really feel like Rez. It was definitely a seperate experience on its own, but pretty good.

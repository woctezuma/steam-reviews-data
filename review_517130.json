Very little boxing involved in the routines I tried out. More like stick you hand in front of the queue of dots that come too fast to actually box to.

Certainly got sore arms after a few challenges but not in what I would consider a good way, as I was just holding my arms up in awkward positions for much of the time, so more like a dance/postional game than boxing IMO (which is not what the name implies).

You can either create the notes yourself, or play a song where other people had already created the notes. This means that some song that you like you may not be able to play it or it simply sucks because the person who created it doesn't know how to properly create it.\nThat being said, some of the popular songs are really fun to play, cheers for whoever created them.\n\nOverall/TLDR:\nAudioshield is still a superior product compare to this due to the fact that you can simply play any song you like from YouTube.

Even if you already own Audioshield, I think it's still well worth to get this one as well (and vice versa).", "timestamp_created": 1511219448, "timestamp_updated": 1511219448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36617109": {"recommendationid": "36617109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203203624", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 515, "last_played": 1516110806}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6bcf\u5929\u7528\u6765\u5065\u8eab\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u5df1\u7f16\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u6b4c\u66f2\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002\n\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0fbug\uff0c\u7c98\u8d34\u4e2d\u6587\u6216\u65e5\u6587\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4f1a\u663e\u793a\u4e71\u7801\u3002\n\nThere is a little bug : \nwhen paste Chinese or Japanese characters , mostly messy codes.", "timestamp_created": 1511079254, "timestamp_updated": 1511079254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36581396": {"recommendationid": "36581396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182902058", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 66, "last_played": 1516065828}, "language": "english", "review": "Soundboxing combines many things I personally enjoy in VR and in rl in a pretty simple seamless system.This game's fun factor is is throttled to the max. It rewards you for your performance with a nice leaderboard system that keeps you wanting to come back. Their integrated website which you can access outside vr is a nice touch to help you keep track of your progress - It lets you know when someone has surpassed your position on the leaderboards or when someone tries your challenges, you could even watch replays. Merging youtube with the game gives you unlimited potential for challenges and content. \n\nMy one gripe is that the challenge search system is not very concise. The filters such as \"Popular\" \"Top\" \"New\" aren't very useful. I would like to be able to find the most played challenges or favorited challenges in descending order within a genre and there is no way to do that currently. This could be intentional to encourage us to explore different songs and not keep the content bottlenecked to the popular songs.\n\nAnother suggestion would be to expand a bit on the leaderboard system to go beyond just individual songs/challenges  - A more in-depth stat tracking system would also add more replayability. \n\nOverall I highly recommend this game to anybody with a vr headset you will have fun and get a good little workout to boot. Just don't get discouraged if you aren't very good at first. It may take some time to get the fundamentals down like identifying the color with the respective right/left hand. Once you get that down you can flow perfectly through complex challenges with ease.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1510954994, "timestamp_updated": 1512281957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36335718": {"recommendationid": "36335718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007041483", "num_games_owned": 322, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513137019}, "language": "english", "review": "Custom mapped challenges make this the best VR rhythm game I've tried.", "timestamp_created": 1510029175, "timestamp_updated": 1510029175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36266011": {"recommendationid": "36266011", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971857001", "num_games_owned": 1547, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509792181}, "language": "english", "review": "A very enjoyable excerising/rhythm boxing game similar to Audioshield.

The songs are streamable from youtube, but they have a surprising amount of notecharts to playthrough that are manually made by the community that 8 out of 10 times are very accurate and very, very fun to play. The UI is very crisp, with support for playlists players have made or just sorting through a player's profile of tracks they created so that if you find a song you loved playing with a track that suits your musical tastes, all you have to do is look to the left and go through the simfile creator's profile to see everything else they've created and you'll often have a plethora of cool stuff to play that's likely right up your alley. It reminds me of youtube before they deleted the all activity tab, it's like a self branching economy of content relevant to your interests and I love it. \n\nThe only thing outright clunky about the UI is the scrolling which only shows 3 tracks at a time per row, everything else is top tier.\n\nI also think it's freaking adorable some of the poses people record at the end of their song charts since the dancing robots are what I assume to be recordings of players dancing. I've seen everything from players doing goofy poses to cheering to dabbing. It gets a chuckle out of me often.\n\nI was able to find charts for everything from mainstream trash to video game OSTs to obscure vocaloid songs (While it doesn't have EVERYTHING, there is a SURPRISING amount of tracks that are made), all with entertaining charts that make you actually pull off real dance moves without thinking about it most of the time. If there is one thing this game is, it's a WORKOUT. After 3 tracks I have to take a break because my arms feel like jello, but I have so much fun playing that when my arms work again I just feel like playing more songs. This is as entertaining to me as any arcade rhythm game with official grade simcharts and I'm happy I got it.\n\nOn a side note, the fact that there are two pinned threads containing \"Harder difficulty maps\" and even a \"Workout chart suggestion\" containing a lot of DDR stuff and etc. shows me that whoever made this game actually knows why people love playing rhythm games.", "timestamp_created": 1509203463, "timestamp_updated": 1509204368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599012", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35978541": {"recommendationid": "35978541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122295589", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508897221}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the best beatmap VR game by far.", "timestamp_created": 1508895088, "timestamp_updated": 1508895088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35843573": {"recommendationid": "35843573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014894364", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508443724}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Pros:[/b]\nSuper fun gameplay\nYouTube integration\nHighscores\nCustom user made beatmaps\nCustom website with history\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\nSometimes highscores don't save [b]<--[/b] [i]See below[/i]\nNo osu! integration\n\n[b]Overall:[/b]\nI'll just start off with saying I [i][b]adore[/b][/i] Soundboxing. Jumping right into it the game is insane levels of fun! Whenever I want to wind down from work or maybe get a workout at home, I load up this game. Soundboxing is simple enough for new players to VR (I showcased it at a party!), but challenging enough for even experienced players. [i][b]I'm not going to go over actual gameplay here, because that'd be really hard to describe a VR game like this and do it justice. Check out the trailer if you want to see the action.[/b][/i]\n\nSoundboxing has YouTube integration, which means there's pros and cons to that aswell. Soundboxing has thousands and thousands of music videos to choose from on YouTube to 'dance' to while they play in the background of the screen. Whenever you want to search for a song all you have to do is be on the search screen and preface your search request by saying \"Search.\" For example: \"Search The Power of Love.\" It searches YouTube and pulls up anything that matches your request, just like on the normal website. The downside to this is that sometimes the song that you want to play doesn't have a beatmap... and that brings me to another point: User made beatmaps.\n\nIn Soundboxing there are NO auto-generated beatmaps; they are all user made! This is good and bad at the same time. The good is that a lot of the time when you play a song, it feels like the beatmap goes PERFECTLY to it. The community works hard to create beatmaps that are fun and challenging while also still matching the beat and lyrics perfectly. This means that a more chill song might have a slower beatmap and be easier, but a fast paced or energetic song might kick your butt. Now here's the bad: Every beatmap is user made. While there's tons of songs with good beatmaps, there's plenty that have terrible beatmaps. Some songs don't even have beatmaps at all! This is where the rest of the community comes in. It's up to the community as a whole to make GOOD beatmaps. If you don't think someone did justice on a song, you can create your own! Some songs have multiple beatmaps and each one is made by a different player!\n\nThe highscore system in Soundboxing is amazingly simple and addictive. When you finish a song, you are ranked on a highscore list for that beatmap based on how many consecutive balls you hit and how many points you scored. Some players can get a full 100% on the song and still be drastically different scores. The harder you punch, the higher your score! Now, one problem I've run into as of the last patch is that sometimes the highscore doesn't save. That's frustrating. Like, really frustrating. Recently I did a very hard beatmap, 100%, on my first try. I was WORN OUT! after that song, because I put my all into it. My reward was an ERROR, score did not save! It's not even on their website, either. Very, very disappointing to say the least. Apparently the developer knows about this and hopefully the issue will be fixed soon.\n\nAnd speaking of highscores, that brings me to their website: [URL=https://www.soundboxing.co/]www.Soundboxing.co[/url]. This is such a clever idea and I am flabbergasted at why I don't see more devs do this! All of your song history and scores are saved on the site, so you can easily view them out of VR. Your friends' history aswell as global highscores are shown here, too!\n\nOverall, I believe Soundboxing has a few more challenges to overcome, but I will 100% without a doubt recommend this game.

Thousands of challenges to play, and new ones popping up every day! YOU can make your own, challenge your friends! It's a great strenght to have, infinite content.\n\nIt is also, I feel, the greatest weakness of Soundboxing.\n\nAllow me to present you with a cautionary tale: I made a playlist. Almost an hours worth of tracks, all of which I really liked, and replayed 2-4 times a week. I had great fun!\n\nThen, one day, I came back to my list and noticed that some tracks had gone missing.

If you launch it from steam, it works fine, and adds the shortcut to home. But, that shortcut will never work, it will always open the steamvr version and not the oculus sdk version, which means your stuck on a \"waiting for steam\" screen forever. (Even if steam is open in the background). So unable to launch from home, which sucks because all other steamvr games work.\n\n-The search seems kind of broken to me. It doesn't really hear what I say, it just randomly looks for things that sound kind of like it. A lot of words, or singers names, are absolutely impossible to look up.\nAlso, there's only searching in English. So want to dance to that fun Spanish song that's on the radio all the time? Forget it. Also there's no on screen keyboard (which would fix most of these problems).\n\n-Before starting any song, hitting the grip buttons changes the way you hold the boxing gloves. Which is good, you can set your grip. But, the grip button is super easy to hit on accident (on Oculus) so you are constantly starting songs with messed up grips because you accidentally changed them, and you cannot set it in one way permanently (why not?)\n\n-A lot of videos have on screen ads, really this shouldn't be there, is that even legal (showing someone els-es ads) And you cannot click on anything on the video, so you can't close the ads either.\n\n-You can see YouTube's related videos after every video, which sometimes have superb videos in other languages. You can't click them, oh, and you can't search for them either. They're just there, starting at you, showing you what you CANNOT play.\n\nAll these small annoyances make me not want to play. So I would not recommend this game, if you have an Oculus.

More importantly, it's fun.\n\nIt's such a shame that the rest of the experience feels like it should be early access. The UI is difficult to navigate at times, search is fairly useless, and the game has a tendency to lock up. I can forgive these things because of the low price point, but the real unforgivable sin is the real lack of dev communication and community curation. Games like this live or die on it's community and Soundboxing seems to be on the verge of dying. The challenge creation tools are extremely limited and difficult to make. Challenges with videos that have been pulled down are still up. What challenges are new are never pushed to the featured section as that section is never updated. \n\nConsidering a lack of updates (last update was in June 2017 as of writing), it seems progress will be slow.

My question is always, does the game improve my appreciation of music? The answer here is hell freaking yeah. \n\nI love the YouTube integration (buttery smooth, with voice search working just fine) and how there's lots of popular songs that players have made a \"beatmap\" to. Even better, if there isn't a beatmap to your song request then you can easily make one yourself. Sure this means that not all beatmaps are made equal. I suggest only liking beatmaps that are good to lead the commmunity in the right direction or making your own (more on that later).\n\nHowever, it almost doesn't matter because it's usually just fun to box while listening to your favorite jam. Basically as long as the beatmap is not awful, you won't really notice because you've having too much fun. The VR environments are also nice and the leaderboards are quite challenging to get to the top spot. I played a whole hour and the only reason I stopped was because I was covered in sweat. \n\n[b]The one thing that differentiates Soundboxing from all the other VR rhythm games is how easy it is to make your own beatmap to any song you find on YouTube.  I have spent most of the 10 hours in this game creating beatmaps to my favorite songs.  It's just fun to create and then publish them and then get notifications of people doing your challenge.  Also, if there's a beatmap from someone else you didn't like, then you can step up to the ring and punch out a better one.

It can be incredibly confusing at times, leaving you to bumble about, trying to figure out what's going on. I don't even know what my score is at the end of a round without fishing around the high score list. (It may eventually be 'obvious', but I was literally looking all over the place trying to find it, a couple times.) As a new player, this should be natural -- not a learning curve.\n\n- The ability to scale the playing field is a welcome feature, as a short guy, but having to manually set it for EVERY song is tedious. A toggle to allow making it's adjustment part of the player work flow would be nice. New song? Automatically enter the scale setting. Or at least set a default scaling. SOMETHING.\n\n- I literally had beats that made me cross my hands in an unnatural way. And this was out of nowhere. That's not fun. Felt like I was part spaghetti.

The gameplay was not in sync with the music as the algorithm does not do that well. Every game with predefined beatmaps is far superior. You Tube integration does not help. Gameplay feels often chaotic and shallow.\n\nSoundboxing: Gameplay felt more serious as in Audioshield. It has user made beatmaps and a youtube integration. You can easily create beatmaps to your own favorite songs and share them.  It has 12 different show-stages. -- Can not be recommanded atm as uploading beatmaps does not work and the virtual keyboard does not work for Oculus users --\n\nBeats Fever: Good looking environments, 40 songs with predefined beatmaps. Songs are a bit generic, gameplay is okay but does not feel that organic. A bit chaotic at times. \n\nHolodance: with Osu! integration, great looking, fun gameplay, definitely one of the best. Through Osu integration nearby infinite gameplay.\n\nAirtone: Best rhythm game out there, if you can life with Japanese pop. It has the best rhythm gameplay of all of them: you have to punch/slap the notes, just holding the stick in the direction is not enough; your punches/slaps make a sound when you hit so you hear the rhythm you are beating (not just a short vibration), the presentation is very beautiful, every song has three difficult levels, all in all very fun and addictive. 25 Tracks included.", "timestamp_created": 1499179606, "timestamp_updated": 1499339050, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560163", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33199795": {"recommendationid": "33199795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016440082", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509567939}, "language": "english", "review": "I tried Soundboxing, Audioshield and Holodance, so I can make some comparisons. I like Soundboxing for sure, much more than Holodance, although Holodance is more varied. What killed Holodance for me was the Osu integration - I had to mess about with external installations which I didn't think were very intuitive so I wound up giving up.\n\nWith Soundboxing all the beatmaps are created by the users. This is both a good and a bad thing, as the beatmaps are as good as the users make them, however if you are really dissatisfied you can make your own. I like the light social aspect of it - you have your profile with your songs and you can see who played them and whether people liked them. However bear in mind that if you want people to play your beatmaps you are more likely to get them played if you create them on more known songs. If you are like me though, that is irrelevant, since I like to play my beatmaps because I just like the songs!\n\nDue to the fact that the beatmaps are completely custom made, you can't really tailor the difficulty. I found some beatmaps were outright ridiculous, others were challenging but they made sense (no sudden spasm of your hands :p )\n\nI found a few frustrations with the beatmap editor, where some of the beats aren't quite in sync because you have to hit a \"wall\" at the right time. However it is easy to miss the wall, which is almost invisible, which means you miss some beats. I found that I tried to overcompensate by standing closer to the wall, which in turn meant that then my hands were hitting it slightly too early. I guess it takes some getting used to. Correcting mistakes is a bit difficult: you can rewind but some of the beats you created will still remain after a couple of seconds from the rewind point, so you have to guess where they stop, and then resume accordingly. It is not that straight forward since you are trying to follow a beat.\n\nMovement wise Sounboxing is the most repetitive of the 3 games I tried. There is extra emphasis on how strongly you hit a beat though. You can't \"hold\" a note, they are all hits, and there are only so many combinations you can do. It is still quite a lot of fun and I recommend it. You certainly work up a sweat and it is a great way to excercise.", "timestamp_created": 1499112069, "timestamp_updated": 1499112069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

So while you can just put your hands in the way of the orb you actually get more points for punching. And that is what I like. Infact my favorite songs aren't the super fast ones with a million orbs, it's the mid speed songs that are a challenge, but actually give you a chance to do full punches and box. It's a lot of fun.

The game crashes quite a bit though, which ruins the experience. Also, if you accidentally click the pause button (which will likely happen given your grip) you lose your note streak when you resume.

I believe I'm on patch 1.13, which came right after a major optimization pass by the developer.  I have an i7 6700k and a 1080 founders with I think the local cable company's fastest \"consumer\" internet ($70 range /month?) for what that's worth. \n\n\nWorth every cent.  In fact, worth 3 times what I paid for it.  I'm already at 30 hours actively played, which means it's already outlasted most of my VR games.  The last non-vr game I played for a long time is Total Warhammer (Warhammer, Total War) and I'm at 151 hours and $100 spent on that game), \n\nI'm a little nervous about copyright shutting the game down, I admit.  I just want to go on the record as saying that even if I had to watch youtube adds to play the game (just like when watching music videos on youtube) I would still think this game is worth it.   Although that little Geico Gekko would drive me nuts (Geico has the long not-skippable ads).  I might boycott Geico out of spite after watching 2 hours of gekko commercials.  The point being that if Youtube needs to monitize this, there's room in my wallet and my patience for compromises that gives youtube its due.  Although I have picked up 3 mp3s already after playing this, so at least the music company I have been angry at for years is getting its due (why are soundtracks with music made for the movie more expensive than the movie!?).  \n\n\nI have not tried audio shield or the beetle game.  Getting more points for moving faster is a huge draw of Soundboxing for me, as was the need to really MOVE.  Plus I feel soundboxing requires a lot more variety in how you move -- basically if your two hands can move in any combination of ways - Soundboxing supports it as a dance/boxing move series.  \n\n The user generated content is, of course, hit or miss, but I've found plenty that are really good.  Plus, after getting a sense for what kind of things I find to be really fun/not-fun (there are almost infinite variations possible) I look forward to making my own.  The best ones really give you a sense of over-the-top dancing (if I tried this in real life, people would get hurt).  You can also probably actually box through most of it, but I doubt boxing teaches throwing a right cross down to your left knee . . . just remember it can't measure power, only speed, and there's no bag, so don't hurt your joints by overextending and be aware it will probably give you bad habits by emphasizing speed and ignoring power and follow through).  The haptic feedback is just right to give you a sense of \"popping\" bubbles and allowing me to pull my punch before I would risk overextension based injuries.  \n\nMy only complaint is that I wish the height could be adjusted in game.  [EDIT: As of a new update, it can!] I play with a sloped roof that makes high&wide notes *thunk* and at 5'7'' there are some really high notes I can just barely clip.  (I have short arms).  I've tried telling steam that the floor is 8 inches below where it really is, but that only helps a little, if at all.  I'm not clear on what determines how tall I am relative to the robots. Fortunately, as an oculus user, a new set of controllers is only $99 and HUGE benefit: the ring REALLY protects your hand.)  Also the fireworks are GREAT fun.  \n\nI should probably throw in that I was a giant fan of rockband (2?) and guitar hero (3?).  So I'm obviously into this type of game.  (oddly, rockband vr doesn't really grab me, I think because I'm not big on improv and the \"feeling\" of playing in front of an audience is not of even slight interest to me, and I like a technical challenge with exact yes/no key presses (even though I am bad at it), so it looks kind of mushy to me.  And it's going to let me go off script, I'd rather something that lets me plug an electric guitar into my computer and actually learn to play. Plus of course the need to order a guitar online is a big meh).    \n\nAlso: I recommend a cover for your VR headset that is better at handling sweat.  I wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes after using it, but I'm sure that's going to destroy the foam and isn't perfect on a porous surface.  My heartrate did hit 114 after one set (my resting is in the 50s), so it's pretty active. Far more so than robo recall at it's most active.  I can definitely see how that guy lost 50 lbs. \n\nAs for my VR interest, so far only a few games have made it to the 30 hour mark: Elite Dangerous (sooooo close to what I want but I got sick and tired of the police killing me for stupid reasons when I was trying to be super law abiding and helpful, plus travel time needs more automation), Subnautica (I have an innate fear of dark water--being on the shore at night creeps me out, so sometimes the thought of playing causes me stress, but still great as exploration/horror/crafting, but look-to-point is bad), robo recall (although getting old) and minecraft (Minecraft got somewhat old by 30 hours, but I bought minecraft in the beta a decade ago, so it was only the content that got old, I love the freedom of left stick movement with snap turning.  While it was the only game to ever make me feel uncomfortable, switching in and out of flat screen and closing my eyes meant that after an hour or two of practice I could run backwards at an angle while jumping of cliffs without the slightest twinge.  The toggle-flatscreen mode was GENIUS).", "timestamp_created": 1491878683, "timestamp_updated": 1492128825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31068064": {"recommendationid": "31068064", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995558515", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 2434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512863494}, "language": "english", "review": "Soundboxing is in the same vein as Audioshield, but it's more about punching than deflecting.

This creative layer to the game sets it apart from Audioshield or most other VR games for that matter. Audioshield is predictable, but Soundboxing is playing someone's personal choreography. Note that if the song you want isn't already set up as a challenge, you have to create it to play it. That's really not so bad though.\n\nIs one better than the other?

Soundboxing is the ultimate pick-me-up. It's much more energetic and feels like you're moshing to the music on some songs, on others it feels like you're doing the finger snaps (this is definitely true on the excellent \"Happy\" remix). I was sore this morning from the hour I played when I first got it, and so I said I would only play one song and take it easy. Less than a minute in, that had gone out the window because I was having too much fun. \n\nThis game would easily be worth $20, but it doesn't look as cool in the screenshots/videos as Audioshield so it would be a tough sell without word of mouth. You can turn the robots off if you want. Don't. I thought I would hate them but I think they're actually recorded by the beat creator and so they're excellent. \n\nBuy it. It's cheap.

VR, youtube vids, go nuts. This one allows you a lot more freedom off the bat however, creating custom tracks as opposed to using some formulator to work one it. This has it's pros...And one rather arm aching con.\n\nSoundboxing takes it's main game play philosphy in a different sway to shield. It's on the offensive. Rather than just Audio Shield's 'just getting the orb gets you all you need', there's a multiplier tied in to how much welly you put into a hit. Five minutes later and I was a sweaty mess after going all out on a track. Definitely great potential for an exercise game here. \n\nFew problems however - If people have suggestions to resolve these feel free to leave a comment and I'll get around to correcting this.\n\n- No way to change the youtube stream quality. It streams on a pretty big screen with what I think is 480p. I don't have the greatest internet, so waiting for this to load is a time sink i'd rather not have. Let me crank it down (or up for those with better net) so I can just get to the music and the punching.\n- This is pretty strenuous in comparison to the aformentioned Audioshield - Make sure to have them wrist-straps on, have a nice big open area to punch towards - It likes to go for low and wide stretches sometimes. And don't bother giving this game a shot unless you have some foam replacements/sweat proof foam guards. This game is a sweat machine.\n- It's not as pretty as it's rival.

Soundboxing is by far my favorite.\nThe gameplay is intuitive and encourages high energy motions creating an exhilarating experience that's sure to leave you drenched in sweat.\nThe user generated content can be hit or miss, but if you can't find any premade tracks you enjoy, you can always make your own.\nHowever, making your own tracks (good ones at least) can be far more challenging than just playing.\nYou can't edit individual notes, so you really have to nail it all in one go and you'll likely be playing the same song 5 times or more to create a track you like without any mistakes.\n\nAs fun as I think this game is, I get more excited thinking about what it could be with a few additions.\n[list]\n[*] [b]Workshop Support[/b]\nThe ability to customize the notes/background/avatar is a staple feature for most rhythm games and letting the community take the reigns would add a lot of value to the game.\n\n[*] [b]Transparency Slider for the \"force field\" during track creation[/b]\nThis isn't 100% necessary, and I know the small lines extending from the fists also tell you where the edge of the strike zone is, but it can be difficult to keep track of it while doing elaborate motions.\nI think having the option to set it as translucent or even opaque would aid in reducing errors during creation.\n\n[*] [b]Options to reposition or duplicate the \"force field\"[/b]\nDuring regular play notes can be struck (within the timed window) in seemingly any direction, but during creation you can only generate notes with a forward motion towards the field.\nIf you could move the field within the parameters or place multiple fields (covering left, right, and vertical motions) it would open the door to much more creative and uncompromised track

Trawling the video site to find things to play can be a chore and the huge 360p screen they play on in front of you is a bit distracting. If we were able to use sound files on our own disk drive to play, SoundBoxing would handily beat any other game in this genre. Right now there's also the risk of things like video takedowns or other issues with YouTube itself which might end up removing challenges from the game that relied on them.  \n\nThere are some nice touches though, like the little robo buddies that bop in time to the beat. They seem to play back the moves of whoever created the course, giving you essentially the ideal actions to perform and a window into how exhausted some players were at the end of a track. Creating your own beatmaps involves watching a video and hitting against the forcefield in front of you, fairly easy to do, though it can take a while to find your rhythm.\n\nAll in all, this is a great little game that I think I'll be coming back to a lot and hope continues to grow wth time.", "timestamp_created": 1488320062, "timestamp_updated": 1488320128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30237760": {"recommendationid": "30237760", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970506333", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "last_played": 1516462463}, "language": "english", "review": "I\u00b4m playing Soundboxing on the Oculus Rift and it works absolutely flawless.

ago, which carried over to the full release]\n\nI'm not the best at rhythm games, but I consider myself good enough that I'll get completely thrown off by beats that aren't on time with the music. That was my biggest problem with Audioshield, whose beatmaps were all generated by the game itself and lacked the precision, consistency, and variety needed to make a beatmap fun and replayable.\n\nSoundboxing addresses this need for accurate beatmaps, and executes it very well. This comes with a drawback, however, as beatmaps must be made by users. Soundboxing hasn't been out for a relatively long time compared to other rhythm games that were released on or close to the release of the Vive itself, so the number of songs that will have a beatmap for them is smaller than say, Holodance, which has Osu! support which supports hundreds of thousands of Osu! beatmaps and songs.\n\nThankfully, making beatmaps for songs that don't have them is just as much fun as playing them. It's simple, you just load up the song and start punching away to the beat, and when the song ends you get to share your beatmap instantly. It's seamless, fun, and easy.\n\nThe beatmaps made by the community are voted on and the most popular ones show up in your queue along with the songs your friends make and/or have played and recommended, which means you'll almost always find a song that, even if it's not in your preferred genre, will still be fun to play.\n\nAll in all, I'm very happy with Soundboxing. It's everything I wanted Audioshield to be, and more. The dev is also active in the community, listens to feedback, and pushes out occasional updates, which helps to continually improve the game.\n\nIf you were disappointed with Audioshield like I was, and also don't mind making beatmaps, then give Soundboxing a chance.

Maps created by tall players are completely unplayable to players with low ceilings or short players. This is on the dev's feature wishlist, so it may be tackled soon.\n[*]You type with the SteamVR keyboard, not with a game keyboard. The major issue with this is SteamVR designates the wrong hand to type with a majority of the time, but this is also in issue in many other games. (Audioshield's search, for example)\n[*]In relation to the first issue, there is nothing preventing you from walking all over your playspace to make your beatmap. Except, Standing Mode players have no playspace, so they can't do that. Not much of an issue because 95% of the beatmaps created have the player standing in one spot, anyway.\n[*]You can't log into YouTube from inside SoundStage and pick a video from your viewing history or from your channel.\n[*]You can't hide the freaking announcements button that tells you everyone else is better then you :(\n[/list]\n\nHowever, there are also some must-haves that improve the feel of SoundStage for me:\n[list]\n[*] You see the dancing robots in the trailer? If they annoy you, you can disable them. They still show up when watching high score replays.\n[*] You can alter the beat speed, to see more or less of the playfield and have more or less wanring of impending hits.\n[*] You can link to specific beatmaps online, and they can be previewed using HTML5 magic, so you can check if a course looks too intense for you before actually playing.\n[*] SoundStage can detect if you're making wrong-color hits due to tricky color placements instead of just missing or intentionally using the wrong hand, and will keep your combo going as long as you recognize the issue quickly.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1481788715, "timestamp_updated": 1481788908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28365452": {"recommendationid": "28365452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055408971", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "last_played": 1516292384}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my go-to game when I want to get rid of some energy or exercise for fitness (who knew anyone would ever say that about a video game).

This game has quickly become a favorite and I feel it is a great value price wise especially compared to other song based games! Player created beats, a wide variety of songs, and the ability to create your own beatmaps means you will be entertained as long as you can stand and punch the music! We have tried other song based games and this one is our favorite. This game will make you sweat and you will feel it the next day! I found you sweat harder when you create your own beatmap because of the way you have to punch in order to get the beat bubble to show up....i.e. no cheating or your beatmap will look lazy and boring! So if you are looking for a full body sweat, make your own beatmaps! \n\nA couple of suggestions:\n\n - the first time you use the search feature it works great, every time after that, the box is hidden behind the songs so you can't see what you are typing\n- if there could be a tutorial on how to create a beatmap, I think that would be very helpful. When I did my first one, at the end I didn't have a single beat bubble. Because it was my first one and the robots were mimicking my punch, I didn't realize anything was wrong...it took me a few tries to figure out that I had to punch through the red and yellow lines at the end of the gloves and to make sure I didn't step out of the circle or even close to the edge it seems. I have also noticed that you really have to recoil and extend your arm fully for the best chance of the \"beat bubble\" showing up. I found I sometimes have a tendency to do more of a wrist flicking motion and none of those ever count.  \n\nOverall a great game that leaves you feeling like you danced for hours at a club that plays only your favorite music!", "timestamp_created": 1478142483, "timestamp_updated": 1478142571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26277363": {"recommendationid": "26277363", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960302356", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511149727}, "language": "english", "review": "As of the performance patch for this game, which landed about a week ago, this game went from being 'ehhh' to being 'woot!'

Anyone who has played VR will instantly start having fun the moment they try the game without a tutorial.\n [*]Songs are all player created, which results in notes being synced up with the rhythm much better than Audioshield. \n[*]Creating songs is easy and requires no outside editor. Simply playing a song freeform will result in the songs notes being created from your punches.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Very low skill ceiling, if you have ANY experience with rhythm games you will have no trouble acing even the hardest songs with only a tiny bit of practice.\n[*]User created songs can be dull or outright bad if the author of the song doesn\u2019t have rhythm or try to improvise dance moves.\n[*]Reliance on YouTube for songs makes it difficult-impossible for those in countries that block YouTube videos (Germany) or people without consistent internet to play. \n[/list]\n\n[h1]SUMMARY:[/h1]\n\tSoundboxing, in essence, is a hybrid of precision rhythm games like DDR, and dancing rhythm games like Dance Central. While you are still hitting a sequence of notes, you also feel like you are naturally dancing to the beat; more so than any other rhythm game I\u2019ve played. Anyone can easily jump in and have a good time because at its base the game is insanely fun. That being said the game does lack a skill ceiling as even the hardest songs in the game are easily playable to anyone with any skill in rhythm games.

Most ideas sound good on paper but end up not working in practice. This is the opposite; it sounds kind of pointless on paper but holy crap it is fun. I picked it up because it had really good reviews and I'm just pretty much sweeping up every VR title at this point. I didn't really expect it to be very fun, but I figured I'd give it a go and return it if I didn't like it.\n\nI started the game thinking I'd do a song or two to try and see if I wanted to keep it or return it. I ended up playing for an hour straight and I only quit because my body totally forced me to. I was having such a blast! The targets move around in the zone so you end up basically having to dance/punch to the music. It feels great, and it was a great workout too. I'm trying to get into shape but I hate exercise like everyone else, so games like this are a really cool way to get some cardio in.\n\nYou can also just search youtube for a song and make your own challenge for other people to do. So if there's a song that you want to do that isn't there, just go make it! I'm leaving this review because I want other people to buy it so that there will be even more songs out there. This is fun, runs super smooth, and is a great workout. I see myself putting a bunch of hours into this, which at the price it's at already makes it one of the best VR value purchases on Steam.

Some games will painstakingly create beat maps for each song, but then you're limited to the songs they've done.  This one fixes both by giving the beat map creation to the players of the game. \n\nOne song can have multiple beat maps, so you're able to see various \"interpretations\" of a song, and in some cases, a variety of difficulties. \n\nThis game is still a bit rough in some places though.  Right now it's plagued by occasional slowdowns while playing and creating song beat maps. \n\nSome things I liked:\n[list]\n  [*] Each song \"challenge\" is tied to a particular video, so you can't have someone play the 12 minute extended disco version while someone else plays the 3 minute radio edit and put them both on the same scoreboard.\n  [*] If you see a video challenge that looks interesting but then comes up disappointing for some reason, make your own!\n  [*] In VR, it records all the movements you make even if you don't punch so you can feel free to be expressive with your \"dance\"\n[/list]\n\nThings I didn't care for very much:\n[list]\n  [*] At this time, you can't see your friend's activity without directly putting their name on the website.\n  [*] The game is plagued by slowdowns while creating beat maps. It may or may not still happen during normal play (not sure yet).\n  [*] If your song choice isn't on youtube, you're out of luck (I guess you can try to make an account and upload it yourself?)\n  [*] the \"boxing gloves\" are set at an awkward angle so you have to hold the controllers differently from other games to line it up properly\n[/list]\n\nOverall, this is a great game, and I expect to see much improvement as the developer is still working on it.

You could also see the timer went slower, so.. memory leak perhaps? Other videos worked great.\n\n[b]Audioshield vs Soundboxing:[/b]\nIf you like Audioshield, you will enjoy this game as well. In the latest update, Audioshield discontinued Soundcloud support and implemented Youtube instead. Audioshield also has an automatic beat detection feature for unplayed songs, where Soundboxing is manual. The good thing about Soundboxing, is that you can create a completely new \"beat map\" if you don't like the existing one.\n\n\n[b]Intensity intensifies:[/b]\nAudioshield has a nice feature where you can choose difficulty, and you can also find mods online to replace the existing difficulty settings.\nIn Soundboxing you need to kind of figure out the difficulty level yourself. If you see a song that is 3:20 minutes, but it has 600+ beats / punches, then you know it will be intense. So that gives you an idea of how difficult the song is. If no one has played that song before, then (some will say unfortunately) you need to make your own beat map. You need to stand and punch at the beats however you see fit.\n\n[b]Missing[/b]\nIn the future, I would like to see the following:\n[list]\n[*] Favorites\n[*] Genre selection\n[*] Region based high scores\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1475177187, "timestamp_updated": 1475177187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714930", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25770112": {"recommendationid": "25770112", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988658050", "num_games_owned": 428, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499975140}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes, yes, YES, YEEEEEEEEEEEASSSSH!", "timestamp_created": 1475175308, "timestamp_updated": 1475175308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.385471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39499812": {"recommendationid": "39499812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104388683", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 92, "last_played": 1516163843}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is super addicting.

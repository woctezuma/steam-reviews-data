Definitely a high for some.

From the vector graphic-designed enemies that look like they could have been in HS, to the animation playing faintly behind all of the action, it screams HS in look and presentation. However, the similarities end there for the most part. This is basically a twin-stick shooter, as you control the gun with the right stick, and movement with the left. But rather than just move around freely over the entire play area ala Smash TV or Robotron 2084, you're main area is along the bottom of the screen not unlike Space Invaders or Galaga.  From there, you'll go after the red and green enemies for score and bonuses while avoiding their bullets by either moving/jumping out of the way, or bouncing off of blue objects to make yourself invincible.\n\nYes, you heard right, you'll be jumping and bouncing in this game. By jumping onto a low-moving blue object (or using a wall jump like in NES' Ninja Gaiden to reach a higher blue object), you become invincible to bullets and enemies. Not only that, the destroyed blue objects leave gems behind for you to collect either by hitting the floor and catching as many as you can as they fall, or by hitting the ceiling and getting them all. Another perk of the blue enemies is that bouncing off of them allows you to absorb bullets to fill up a Hyper meter that can be used to unleash a large blast that destroys most enemies (or get a big bonus... if you know how). As a bonus, if you can destroy groups of green ships, you gain a star. And if you collect five stars, you get taken to a bonus level at the end of the current stage to fight in what is clearly an homage to Centipede.\n\nThe action starts slow, but gradually builds into a frenzied skirmish of shooting, avoiding and collecting. The bosses in the game are the same way; starting off simple, but getting more demanding with each new one in terms of how you damage it and its bullet patterns. Thankfully, the controls are responsive and the hit detection seems to be on point as well. And as you frantically do all of this, you'll have some enjoyable music to listen to thanks to the OST that features catchy, synthy beats.\n\nSounds good, right? And for the most part, it is. But there are some issues with the game. First and foremost, are the unkillable enemies. This is a personal taste thing, but I HATE enemies you can't kill, especially when there are a lot of them. I've always felt they were a somewhat cheap way to add difficulty to a stage or section (I'm all for making a given enemy-type tough, but not indestructible). And sadly, this game features these undying things in the form of laser cannons that fire when you touch the ground, laser cannons that fire at timed intervals, and buzzsaws that go around the edges of the entire play area. All you can do is avoid them, which gets tedious after awhile and frustrating toward the end of the game... especially when they cause an unfair death.\n\nYes, this game has them too. There have been times where I beat the level, but triggered the floor laser cannons just as the level was ending. The result was the cannon's firing while the rest of the stage was blowing up. More than once, I found myself unavoidably falling into the laser blast and losing a life as the stage ended. I also encountered similarly unfair deaths after dropping from the ceiling. See, when you touch the ceiling and get all of the gems on-screen, you drop to the floor again. The problem is, you can't land on any blue objects as you fall. You just pass through them due to the invincibility you're given at that moment. When you hit the floor again, you become vulnerable again right away and that's where I got killed by bullet groups that I couldn't avoid thanks to how hectic things start getting around the mid-way point of the game.\n\nA final pair of complaints come from the way powerups are handed out and how long it takes to fill the Hyper meter. It seems as if the powerups drop rather infrequently, and I've yet to figure out if it's because I'm not doing something right/often enough to trigger them, or if the game's just stingy with them. Either way, you really start feeling under-powered when you play through 15 stages and only get one powerup (if you're lucky). Lastly, the Hyper meter always seems to take forever to fill. And as if that weren't enough, I've watched it get emptied out without using it or dying. I'm still trying to figure out if that last part's intentional, or a bug in the game.\n\nSo in the end, what can be said about Hyper Bounce Blast? It's a fun little game and at 30 somewhat short levels, it can be a one-sitting type of game as well. The visuals, the music, the gameplay, several modes to choose from... it all works together pretty well to make for an entertaining game that keeps you on your toes. But issues like questionable deaths, unkillable enemies and some potentially iffy powerup frequency choices put a few blemishes on this game's vector graphics-inspired visage. So while it is a game I recommend, it's one that could have used a few tweaks in my opinion.\n\nScore- 7.5 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1474964203, "timestamp_updated": 1474965103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25683506": {"recommendationid": "25683506", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007513026", "num_games_owned": 535, "num_reviews": 211, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474773555}, "language": "english", "review": "Worst platformer/shooter I've played in ages.\n\nThis game gets it all wrong.

It manages to blend to types of classic games into one and they did an amazing job with it.  Not only is it a fixed shooter but it is also a platformer.  That is just awesome!  Imagine Mario and Space Invaders had a baby.  That baby is this game.\n\nThere are times when you will have hordes of enemies decending upon you firing massive amounts of slow moving projectiles and the only way to survive is to start platforming on other enemies so that you have a shield that can absorb the bullets in mid air.  Those are the times when \"the floor is lava\" is a good concept to have because as soon as you touch the bottom of the level again you loose your bullet absorbing shield.  That tends to end badly.\n\nIf you ever play any classic style games then you need to put this at the top of the list.  One of my favorite things about this game is ths difficulty scaling.  Some classic style games are so hard that after a short period of time you rage quit, maybe eve break a controller if you are using one (been there done that).  This game doesn't cause that.  It does present some challenge but it isn't so hard that you immediately give up.\n\nDon't forget the price of this game.  It's only 5 bucks!  These guys are practically giving this game away.  What can you buy for $5 that will be this much fun?  I'll tell you what, nothing.  Well, nothing that's legal, lol.  \n\nSo in conclusion, this game is definitely worth buying.  It perfectly blends two of the best classic styles of gaming.  The fun factor is cranked up to 11!  Plus, it is only $5.  You can't even buy a meal at McDonalds for $5.  Screw McDonalds.  Keep you money and buy this game.

By combining it with elements of platform games and puzzle games, Hyper Bounce Blast is a unique, if unimpressive shooter.\n\nThe idea is to shoot the red enemies, and jump on the blue enemies while collecting fragments that the red ships leave behind. Once you've gained a plethora of these fragments, the aim is to \"bank\" the points by jumping to the top of the screen before the wave ends.\n\nThe vector styled graphics suit the game well, and controller support is tight and responsive. It also makes you brain think asymmetrically as you have to figure out which enemies to shoot and when to shoot them, as shooting a blue enemy renders it unable to be jumped on, and jumping on enemies is the only way to make your ship impervious to enemy fire. \n\nWhile the ideas around the game are great, keyboard and mouse movement lacks finesse, and it's very easy to lose track of your subtly coloured aiming reticle. The bosses and bullet patterns are also unfortunately very generic, seemingly ripped directly from Cave Shmups.\n\nThat being said, the game has a definitely high difficulty curve, and the price is right, so if you fancy a challenge, it's worth taking a look at. It's a good game, but not a great one.\n\nMy rating: 6 out of 10.\n\nVideo review here:\n[url]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sjQ7Y09hsg[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1469400266, "timestamp_updated": 1469400316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500901", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24282773": {"recommendationid": "24282773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030789129", "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466959302}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]Hyper Bounce Blast[/i] is the latest game from Flump Studios, which you may have heard of from their successful titles, such as Horizon Shift.\n\nAlways faithful to the genre, [i]Hyper Bounce Blast[/i] is a sweet and delicious homage to the 80-90's Shm'up wave, and it succeeds wonderfully in offering unique gameplay mechanics.\n\nYou're controlling a bouncing ship with the ability to wall jump and bounce on the ennemies. \nAs long as you're in the air, you're entirely invincible from every form of threat.

Note that my ability to enjoy a game is not influenced by how I recieved it.[/i][/quote]\n\n[h1]Hyper Bounce Blast[/h1] is a hectic arcade shoot 'em up, with a bit of platforming blended in to add an extra bit of flavour. \n\nGameplay-wise, you take on the role of an energetic shooting machine and plough your way through chaotic waves with the ability to not only blast an infinite amount of bullets in your enemies' path, but to bounce your way whilst doing so. But does this platforming mechanic affect the gameplay enough for it to be an effective use of innovation, [i]and warrant a whole word in the title[/i]? Definitely. You'll see why as I go on to explain. Throughout [i]Hyper Bounce Blast[/i] you'll be constantly trying to stay off the floor. Why? Whenever you are touching this floor, you are vulnerable to bullets. However, when you bounce your way through the level (via jumping on to anything that's blue) you are not only invulnerable to these bullets, but also absorbing them, turning your [i]bullet hell[/i] into a [i]bullet heaven[/i]. There are also other features of the bounciness, such as multipliers and the screen-clearing [i]hyper[/i] that annihilates everything with some serious visual displays.\n\nYou have a couple of gamemodes to choose from which sounds like it would be a huge portion of the replayability, but unfortunately each mode doesn't seem [i]that[/i] worthy of its own mode and rather changes some minor settings such as number of lives, etc. Then there's the [i][b]Tournament Mode[/b][/i]. The speed of the game is changed to an incredibly fast pace (this can be done yourself in the settings for the all gamemodes, so I don't see why it has been granted its own mode) which ultimately conflicts with your platforming abilities. There is no skillful way to speedily bounce through a level, you will almost always fail or be granted success by pure chance. This being said, the gameplay as a whole is [i]very[/i] entertaining and will provide both an enjoyable and satisfying experience through both classic shoot 'em up action and innovation.\n\nOn an aesthetic side of things, Hyper Bounce Blast does provide a vibrant experience, but one that is merely passable. There is nothing special about these graphics and whilst having and overwhelming amount of colourful visuals, they unfortunately show to be slightly underwhelming. This being said, they are by no means 'bad'.\n\n[i]Hyper Bounce Blast[/i] is filled with electronic tunes from the musical mastermind, [i]Quantum Firefly[/i]. I will say that whilst not being outstandingly complex they will soothe a simple mind, thus I enjoyed them. \n\nUSD $5 is a fair enough asking price. Not the cheapest, but I assume on sale it will be very much worth it.\n\nWant to know if you can configure and rebind everything to your hipster needs? Sure. There is an extensive list of settings that you can knock yourself out with.\n\n\n[h1][b]Summary:[/b][/h1]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n\u2714 Enjoyable, innovative gameplay\n\u2714 Combination of genres works\n\u2714 Slick electronic tunes\n\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n\u2718 Gamemodes aren't that great, especially the [i][b]Tournament Mode[/b][/i]\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\n[b]Hyper Bounce Blast[/b] is something new to a seemingly crowded genre of shoot 'em up games. It will provide an enjoyable and unique experience, one that's not to be missed by people wanting something refreshing.\n\n[b]Rating:[/b] \n7.3/10 - \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\n[code]Did you enjoy that review?

[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]\nIf you're looking for the same old same old from the SHMUP experience, you can look away from Hyper Bounce Blast. Just like Horizon Shift, it makes a small twist in the genre by adding a platforming mechanic, and that mechanic is well implemented in terms of gameplay. There's something satisfying to bouncing from enemy to enemy while shooting everything in site. And this core gameplay feels fresh in the genre, even if it may not have a lot of staying power over the long haul. Look, this is a 5 dollar game, and there are things that could have raised the game to the next level in terms of replayability, such as some random enemy formats or different options. But the core experience keeps thing simple and yet fun, allowing you to focus on small simple bite-sized elements in the game that combine to a good couple hour experience. It's a developer that doesn't want to make the same old game: he's experimental: and not in the \u201cartsy\u201d type of way. It's the gameplay mechanics he plays with: and I will openly admit, I'm always fascinated by those who try something different in a genre that usually keeps things safe. And good on Flump studios for producing games that change things up: and deliver an enjoyable experience.\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUGUbQabLmI\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]  The addition of the platforming mechanic adds to the chaos, and it does work. Gives good incentive to use with not only the point multiplier, but the ability to absorb bullets. Complements gameplay, without being distracting.\n[*] Boss battles do a good job of testing skill, without being overly complicated. Introduces small new mechanics that don't go too far off what has been played up to that point.\n[*] Simple aesthetic compliments the gameplay here. Simple to see action, and even through the chaos, I felt like I could easily see everything at all times.\n[*] Bank system is cool. Gives good incentive while not being forced to use it. A good point chasing mechanic.\n[*] Color mechanic. Every enemy is easily identifiable in terms of weaknesses because of this color system. Good information that's easily processed by the player.\n[*] Controls works for the game on both the controller and keyboard/mouse (I prefer the controller here). \n[*] Music selection once again complements the action here (yes, I have used the word complement a lot in this review, but when a word works, it works.)\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Some modes don't work, like the Tournament mode. The new platforming mechanic + the speed element makes movement too fast, not letting you capitalize on the gameplay in question. \n[*] A mode that had some randomization of enemy placement would have really taken the replayability of the game to the next level. \n[*] A lot of my complaints really comes down to mechanics regarding the length/variety of the game over time.

You're gonna need those extra threads to handle all the bizarre, out of context, new and fresh tasks they relentlessly pummel you with.\n\nHyper Bounce Blast is guilty of all of the above -- and it's freakin RAD. My favorite thing about this developer is his ability to subvert the shooter genre. Sure, this is kind of a 'vertical shooter'... but it's also a twin stick shooter, a platformer (with walljumping... WALLJUMPING) and a puzzler.\n\nThrow all of that in a blender with a super slick presentation and an awesome soundtrack, and you wind up with this... infuriatingly gorgeous video game that has (probably) \"for adrenaline junkies only\" plastered all over it.\n\nI salute Flump Studios for bringing me one step closer to a straight jacket being mandatory and therefore eliminating wardrobe decisions...

It is described as a Shoot Em' Up combined with the classic platformer style which is kind of unique for this style of gameplay. It also seems to be a sort of bullet hell game but without the free flying and sort of wall jumping along.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThis game seems to be a rather different kind of Shoot Em' Up/Bullet hell game with some platforming elements combined into the game, which make it much harder than your average Bullet Hell / Shoot Em' Up. The main mechanic is being able to wall jump from the left and right wall, which means there is also gravity involved in the game. This really separates it from other similar games of this genre, and makes a different sort of gameplay style from other games like this. I rather liked the platforming elements that are implemented into the game, it gives it that more difficult sort of feel when you are trying to avoid the bullets but are trapped in the corner.\n\nAlthough it seems to be that bit more different from the other sort of games of this genre, it does have a big flaw that I personally don't like. Some of the bosses in the game have a rapid amount of bullets that are being shot at you, and compared to the size of your character makes it so difficult to avoid the bullets. Especially if you wall jump and try to swerve your way through the bullets you are almost certain to get hit. I really don't like this, even though this game is really fun, but just a bit too difficult that takes some of that fun out of the game.\n\nWith the game being practically the same over and over again, you would expect there to be several different types of game modes. Some of which are locked and can be unlocked by progressing far enough into other game modes. You have the Arcade Classic, start with 2 lives and try to fight through all the waves, you get a checkpoint before and after each boss battle. Arcade Arrange is the same as Arcade Classic except you have no extra lives but you get a checkpoint after each level. Time rush, see how far you can get with in a fully powered up ship when the game speeds up each wave. Lastly there is Tournament Mode, see how far you can get in a fully powered up ship with each wave increased speed.\n\nThere is a nice range of different game modes to keep you entertained for longer than you normally would. There are also 2 locked gamemodes which I don't know what they are as I haven't progressed enough to unlock them. I for one don't personally like the locked gamemodes for the game, forces you to get far into the game to unlock other modes which you may or may not like. There is online leaderboards, if you are the more competitive sort of players and want to try to beat other people at their score, I for one am not very competitive so it doesn't compel me to play more and try to beat other peoples score.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+ Has some platforming elements, makes it unique from other games of the similar genre\n+ Lots of Game Modes\n+ Online Leaderboards\n+ Full Controller Support\n+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Lots of bullet, makes the game too hard and takes some fun from the game\n- 2 Locked gamemodes, unsure why they are locked\n\n[h1]Result / Final Thoughts[/h1]\nHyper Bounce Blast is a unique Shoot Em' Up / Bullet Hell game that has some platforming elements to it, the game itself is fairly difficult a bit too difficult that it takes the fun out of it at times. There is plenty of game modes to play through, although two of them are locked. There is a competitive leaderboard, full controller support, steam trading cards and Achievements.

To go into more detail the game has unique concepts that blend well when you are playing the game. The platforming feels great, satisfyang, and responsive, which leads to some satisfyiong jump combos. The shooting also does it's job just fine. I use mouse and keyboard instead of controller, but I can only imagine that controllers are better than the M+K setup. The game is in all honesty just pure fun, I genuinely can't think of any cons at the moment; not to say that there aren't any cons, but none of any significance.\n\nI'm glad to say that the soundtrack is just as awesome as the game itself. The soundtrack not only sounds great, but also matches the game through the type of rythm's. During the waves of enemies the soundtrack is energetic, but before a boss it switches to give you a sense of approaching danger, then it goes to a new song that is different then the ones played during the waves. \n\nAll in all I couldn't recommend this game enough, espescially since the asking price is only 5$.

Gameplay is simple and easy to start, but difficult to master with so much going on! I was immediately reminded of Geometry Wars not only by the visual style but also by the mess of things happening all at once. Fortunately, in this game you are completely invulnerable to enemy attacks as long as you stay airborne by bouncing off the blue enemies. As an added bonus, when bouncing, you actually absorb enemy fire to power up your screen-obliterating special attack! Despite the invulnerability, it can still be quite challenging as blue enemies aren't always spaced out evenly. If you aren't keeping the reds and their projectiles thinned out, hitting the ground can spell the instant loss of a life. Boss battles limit your bouncing and provide a bit more of a bullet hell experience, but are not too challenging and very fair once you learn their patterns.\n\nAll in all, Hyper Bounce Blast is a lot of fun and can be very addicting.

Now Horizon Shift was a cool game however I felt confused by it's mechanics at times (probably my own fault because i'm not that used to crazy mechanics) however this game is a completely different story.\n\nHBB's main mechanic is as expected, bouncing! You bounce off blue platforms and enemies and while you are in the air bouncing, you cannot be killed and the higher you bounce, the more points you will get when shooting enemies. \n\nSo it becomes an interesting game of multitasking because you have to maintain your bouncing while also dealing with enemies and obstacles that appear in later waves and frankly? It never gets TOO HARD, it's always fair, so when I mess up it is my fault because I wasn't paying attention because everything in this game is telegraphed very well in advance.\n\nAlso the bosses definitely not dissapoint and make full use of the mechanics, so expect hectic platforming shooting action on those!\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game for everyone, even those who do not play these games.

That's not a bad thing, that's just the role it has for me and it serves it extremely well. It's a 2D side scrolling puzzle platformer. There's no direct combat (though you can be killed), the game is more about block puzzles, figuring out what you need to move, where and the correct timing. It's pretty simple at first but after a few sets of levels, things get a little more challening with puzzles really requiring players to know the ins and outs of mechanics, sometimes forcing the player to learn new things as they come up with a solution.\n\nEach puzzle is satisfying and so far, not frustrating in the slightest. The visuals are really charming and the music is just nice and relaxing, it doesn't make you feel at all rushed.\n\nI think my favourite thing about it is the game just doesn't get boring for me and it fits into my life perfectly, being there for whenever I need it without feeling like I'm forgetting anything. If I'm stuck for something to play or just not having a great week, I can put this on and even though it doesn't solve those problems, it's a nice way to spend some time.\n\nI highly recommend picking this game up.

Escape Goat 2 takes you to think about every move he makes to solve levels. A platform / puzzle game with an unusual and mysterious theme: you play with a goat that must escape a tower full of traps and save some sheep on the way. I'm still pondering what really this story. Inquisition? Witchcraft? I don\u2019t know.\n\nThe art of the game changed a bit from the first game. Honestly it bothered me at first (I really like retro pixel art!) But with five minutes I was adapted to the new design. The light effects have greatly improved and overall design was cleaner. Even the goat is what else has changed but still charismatic and interesting. A purple goat, see! The animation has also become more varied. When it is stopped or near an edge or near traps: there is a corresponding animation every situation, a great work.\n\nThe sound of the game is a separate chapter. The songs are well composed and combine well with this climate of stained glass, castles, traps and mystery. There are still some known and reused sounds that make us seem that this game is familiar.\n\nThe gameplay is the same as the first game. But if you had no opportunity to play the previous, I am sorry for you and explain to you: there are tasks that require you to jump, push buttons, break boxes, give dashes, setting the time and pace of enemies and moving walkways, the speed with the fire consumes the wood from a box ... This requires you several attempts and perseverance. The difficulty is gradual. The hard levels are displayed later and needs of a certain amount of crystals to unlock them. Many levels will need of hours of meditation, others several attempts until you reach the perfect technique.\n\n Anyway, Escape Goat 2 is a continuation of a great game way more than competent. Some levels require you intelligence, some skill or both together. It is very fun game in the same way the previous one but with a more beautiful appearance. Fun note 10! We hope the sequel!\n\nArt: 8/10                  Sound: 8/10                         Gameplay: 10/10                     Fun: 10/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1473046970, "timestamp_updated": 1473046970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501320", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25287253": {"recommendationid": "25287253", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973389214", "num_games_owned": 816, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480006667}, "language": "english", "review": "Puzzle-platformers are a dime-a-dozen. *Great* puzzle platformers are rare.

It doesn't resort to the same hackneyed puzzles that you've solved a hundred times before.

Without the help of the friendly mouse who has the ability to get through small holes and teleport, the game itself would be really hard to beat. The goat itself has the ability to sprint, smash through boxes, and double jump. The game involves some challenging physics based puzzles and a little error requires you to restart the level. Graphics and artwork are great with a smooth character movement and switch mechanism. If you like puzzles and a little bit of challenge, I think this game is perfect for you.\n\nOverall I would give this game a 8/10.\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

It's very clever in it's puzzle and platforming. Having enjoyed Escape Goat 1 i was really looking forward to this game and it delivered. It's very much improved from the first title. There's plenty of content in the game and added stuff such as mutators will keep you coming back for more. I have really enjoyed this game. During this review i'll compare this to the first Escape goat and give my opinion on if it has improved or worsened.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThey've totally changed the art-style of the game, from the pixel art style to much sharper clean looking art-style. In my opinion it looks gorgeous and runs buttery smooth. The FPS are locked to 60 FPS, i even turned off V-Sync but still locked to 60 FPS which isn't bad at all. All in all the game runs and looks very good. The first Escape goat also had a pretty good art-style but i think this one looks much better.\n\nSound: \n\nIf you have played the first game you would expect nice music from this game. The music indeed is very nice. The music still gives that same creepy vibe which the first game gave. Each level has it's own soundtrack and all of the ones i listened to were very good.\n\nGameplay: \n\nGameplay of this game is very similar to the first one, they've added some nice new abilities to your rat friend. The puzzles are very clever but not hard. It took me 3 hours and 55 minutes to beat the story missions. There is still some stuff to do so this game is easily a 6 hours game, add on top the mutators mode and you can have even more game time. The story is similar to the first one. You go in the castle and save your sheep friends. Still got that creepy satanic vibe from the castle. In addition the the sheep you get these ghosts from corpses of dead animals which give you some story information from time to time.\n\n\nNew abilities were added to the rat like a mini hammer power-up which turns your rat into a block, duplicate rats ability which lets you have 4 rats instead of 1. New abilities really give the game new life and makes things interesting and fresh. The game is not entirely puzzles as it involves platforming as well, you need to time jumps/drops, move with an object at the same time to avoid being electrocuted, etc. in order to complete some levels. The goat still has that same double jump and dash abilities. \n\nConclusion:\n\nThis game is very good, if you liked Escape goat 1, you would love Escape goat 2. If you have not played the first one and you like puzzle games, you will love this game. There's plenty to do in the game. It\u2019s addicting too as once you start you keep playing. I beat it in one sitting.

There's a lot of retreading old ground here, needless to say.\n\nThere's a lot higher focus on execution over puzzle solving, which I'm honestly against. This is way more of a platformer than a puzzle game, at this point. Especially true in the secret areas, which are basically just lost levels from the For All Intensive Purposes level set in the original game, that I intentionally did not play because this game's engine is not very good platforming-wise, but it kind of knew that in the original game and kept the focus on puzzles.\n\nThere's also just a fair number of puzzles that are downright stupid or broken. Enjoy your mouse randomly falling off walls using the cape, enjoy having reapers walk onto spaces you don't want them to be when going up or down platforms, There's one puzzle in the second half of the library in particular that's just... really stupid and kind of luck-based. There's also a ton of \"gotcha\" moments, some easy to see in advance, others not so much, A lot of switches, you don't know what they're going to do until you press them, and sometimes they'll trap you and you'll just have to deal with it.\n\nGraphically, it \"looks\" better I guess but the game feels like it has less personality. The music's still great though.

It\u2019s taken me time to truly appreciate these games for the great works of art and entertainment that they are. A few too many rage quits at the hands of Super Meat Boy had me cursing this genre. I never wanted to play any of them again. I\u2019d rather cry in the corner and pray that my mother was still alive so that she could give me a cuddle as I wrap my arms around her legs and she\u2019d tell me that everything would be alright. Well no, god damn, it wouldn\u2019t be. The genre kicked my ass. I was supposed to own it.\n\nOr was I? Are the games in this genre intended to kick your ass? Is that what makes them so memorable when you either have had enough to the point where you delete a game from your hard drive never to be played again \u2013 or certainly until the next time you feel as though you must punishing yourself. We live in a sadistic world when one gains pleasure from torturing ones self but that\u2019s exactly what these types of games do. Then you have your self-obsessed freakazoids, otherwise known as gaming masters, who are able to complete games such as Escape Goat 2 within the allocated 30 minutes to achieve that mighty achievement. I shake my head at their mastery. I am certain that it can be achieved \u2013 I\u2019ve seen it with my own eyes \u2013 but not by a mere mortal.\n\nIt makes me think back to when I was a younger gamer. I used to be that good. The jokes about being like The Wizard and the deep family discussions \u2013 especially with extended family \u2013 that there wasn\u2019t any money to be made in just being a gamer and you needed to do something more real with your life. That I needed to get an education. I did great throughout elementary and dropped off during high school. It wasn\u2019t that the work was too hard. I\u2019d get B\u2019s when instead I should have been getting A\u2019s.  I had a real lazy bone and if I was sent home with homework I simply wouldn\u2019t do it. Home time was all about spending time outdoors with friends playing sport and if nobody was around to play sport I\u2019d be honing my hand eye coordination playing whatever was the latest and greatest on PC, SEGA or PlayStation. It didn\u2019t help that I was a little bit spoilt as an only child and didn\u2019t have a sibling that I had to outwork or outdo.\n\nBut back to Escape Goat. Great game. When I put my mind to it I found myself finishing the levels relatively quickly. Thankfully it\u2019s not as excruciatingly tough as Meat Boy but it\u2019s challenging enough because all of the features of the game are immaculately executed \u2013 it\u2019s supposed to be a challenge. It probably didn\u2019t do as well critically as what it probably should have but the market is constantly flooded with games within the genre that try and do different things \u2013 most of them failing \u2013 so other games tend to suffer as a result of the whole rather than taking a deeper look at what the individual title is trying to achieve and how well they\u2019ve done it. Although the concept and the gameplay isn\u2019t unique this one does it about as polished a job as a small indie company could make. It\u2019s graphics are exactly what I would hope for from the title and everything works in the fashion that it should. Oh and special mention to the glorious stained glass window on the level select screen \u2013 a touch of imagination and pure brilliance.\n\nIf you\u2019re wanting a smart and intellectual challenge in the form of a puzzle platformer and you have yet to play this great franchise then I\u2019d recommend that you start with the original and build your way up to it. However, that\u2019s more personal preference \u2013 I like to start with the beginning game \u2013 and yet the developers at MagicalTimeBean have done such a marvelous job that you really don\u2019t need to do that. You\u2019re not going to get into \u201cOMG this is insanely difficult for the start of a new game\u201d if you don\u2019t. It teaches you the core mechanics extremely well. The puzzles gradually climb once the developers have expected that you should have gotten the core gameplay components down. It\u2019s well balanced in that regard \u2013 again much better than many of its peers.\n\nFor a game that began its life as a pun it sure as hell plays like a champ.\n\nFor our epic giveaways and similar reviews head to [url=http://www.steamified.com/]Steamified.com[/url]\n\nTo join in our fantastic community join our [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified]Steam group[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1459006777, "timestamp_updated": 1459006777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510405", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21934100": {"recommendationid": "21934100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054465150", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456921057}, "language": "english", "review": "It's amazing, great puzzle platformer.

The jump arc feels great, the movement is smooth and the mapping is really well done. The game recommends using a controller which shouldn't be an issue for anyone in this day and age and it makes good use of each button.\n\nI am definitely going to finish this when I get a chance, it's been a very unexpectedly pleasant experience.

Out of 70+ levels, only the very last 2 made me open Youtube for a helping hand. You can also choose to tackle the extra levels before finishing the story.\n\nIt takes a little while to get used to the goat's floatier controls, and the duo has some new tricks up their sleeve (aside from the returning Magic Hat, there are two new power-ups): but other than that, the game is pretty much more of the same, with very improved graphics and a more vibrant soundtrack. It's also a bit longer than the original's story mode, although the relatively low difficulty means it shouldn't take more than 2 hours to get through the story, and perhaps 5 hours including the harder levels.\n\nOverall, a great way to spend some time during a weekend.

It's a puzzle platformer type where you have to figure out ways to get to the end of the level as you climb a tower and save some sheep. The unique mechanics involving your friend the rat are pretty interesting and there were a few head scratchers. One thing I don't like about it, though, is that you don't really know what's going to happen, so with some puzzles you might expect being able to do X but you can't because the trigger does something unexpected, so you're obligated to restart the map. That's okay, though, because most of the puzzles seemed to be able to be done pretty quickly. I guess they're excusing their poor conveyance by not being just disgusting with timings, so that's cool. I got through all of the first act before I shelved this game, though.

The first half of the game is in many ways just as fun as its ever been, reintroducing many of the same mechanics as the original and reminding me why I loved that game so much. It's at this point that I was firmly in love with the game, for as familiar as it was I had been wishing for more Escape Goat and developer Magical Time Bean was here to satisfy.\n\nUnfortunately it may have been better if I had decided to quit after seeing the credits roll the first time, as upon returning to the castle to visit the other half of optional puzzles I'd unlocked the cracks in Escape Goat 2's foundation started turning into holes.\n\nWhat the first game did so well and seemingly effortlessly was introduce new mechanics non-verbally, teaching you through gameplay instead of a traditional tutorial as it switched up the puzzle hook every new world. 2 does this too, but it often operates under a presumption that you're already familiar with the systems it introduces, and freely uses them without giving you time to learn in a game that's already a far steeper challenge than the original. Where the first game was always careful to be completely clear when showing you how its world worked, Escape Goat 2 is muddy and hard to parse.\n\nThe only way for me to get around this was through trial and error and occasionally leaning on a guide for support, neither of which I'd previously felt necessary as I always had everything I needed right in front of me and had been taught how to make use of them. There were numerous recurring moments where I was completely unsure how a puzzle was even suppose to work, and the game was giving me no hints to ease me in. It's not that the puzzles are more difficult but that they feel cheap and intentionally difficult to understand, often including red herring items just to clutter the screen and usually relying on switches which you typically have no idea what will trigger until you already have.\n\nThe significantly increased reliance on timing and twitch platforming expose a lot of the otherwise serviceable control issues, most frustrating being the odd weighting which makes precision movement agonizingly inconsistent. Many puzzles begin already in motion, leaving me no time to even look over what I'm jumping into before I have to start making decisions that usually caused me to have to restart because I missed a jump or didn't hit a button at exactly the right moment. It's things that feel out of place and work poorly within Escape Goat 2's framework, like puzzles that were originally scrapped but brought back in just to pad out a game thinks it needs to be larger for the sake of being a sequel.\n\nI think it's worth mentioning again that Escape Goat 2 isn't awful, and I don't regret the time I spent with it. It's simply that coming from such near perfection to comparative mediocrity is rather more shocking than it might have otherwise been if this had been the first game. Escape Goat 2 fails largely because of the weight of its predecessor, which in its attempts to best end up being its downfall. If all you ever wanted was more Escape Goat, that's definitely here, but when I finally exited the last room I had begun to considerably question if I really did want that as much as I had thought I did.\n\n[b]Full disclosure: Escape Goat 2 was reviewed using a copy provided by the developer.

The main puzzles for completing the game to a bare-bones ending are not bash-your-head-against-a-wall difficult, while still maintaining a good level of both creative thinking, platforming, and satisfaction for solving.  The music is stellar, the art is gorgeous, and the \"story\" is sparse. \nSome minor issues: the controls feel a tad too floaty, hit-boxes are a bit too broad, and it took me over half an hour of avoiding any contact with Toragos before realizing that you can touch (ride) him without taking damage if you avoid the head.  That last part could have been better demonstrated, because a gamer's instinct in a game like this is to not touch any part of the enemy, lest they perish.\n\nI, for one, will not be 100%ing this game because it would take me WAY too long to find all the invisible keys, and that's not as fun as solving puzzles I can actually see.

Je veux dire, Goat Simulator c'est bien, mais d'une \u00e7a n'a rien \u00e0 voir, de deux ce n'est m\u00eame pas un jeu.\n\nAh. Oui. Je vais peut-\u00eatre devoir m'expliquer. \u00c7a fait une paie maintenant que je sors les crocs face aux pseudo-journos vid\u00e9oludiques. Leur incomp\u00e9tence, leur mauvaise foi et leur manque d'\u00e9thique m'exasp\u00e8rent. Les seuls que je peux encore encadrer c'est RPS et Sterling (et encore, le second, parfois, ne r\u00e9fl\u00e9chit pas plus loin que le bout de son nez, mais soit, du moins am\u00e8ne-t-il quelque chose au paysage).\n\nAlors quand les branleurs sus-cit\u00e9s viennent m\u00ealer Escape Goat 2 et Goat Simulator, je l'ai mauvaise. Quand en prime l'auteur du torchon est infoutu de comprendre que NON, Goat Escape \u00e7a n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mieux comme titre puisque SCAPEGOAT PUTAIN DE BRANLEUR LINGUISTIQUE RETOURNE EN MATERNELLES. ET JOUE AU PREMIER TU COMPRENDRAS PEUT-\u00caTRE M\u00caME POURQUOI CONNARD, je commence \u00e0 gueuler.\n\nQuand le m\u00eame trou du cul se m\u00eale de donner des notes \u00e0 ses jeux pseudo-test\u00e9s et carre un 7/10 \u00e0 Escape Goat 2, j'ai des envies de meurtres. 7/10 c'est \"bien\". Le jeu est au-dessus de \u00e7a.\n\nQuand il ose pr\u00e9tendre que les contr\u00f4les sont merdiques... Il ne devrait pas tarder \u00e0 recevoir sa petite enveloppe remplie de poudre blanche. TIENS, \u00c7A TE DONNERA PEUT-\u00caTRE DES COURS DE BASE SUR LE HEAVY METAL.\n\nAhem.\n\nPlus s\u00e9rieusement, donc, la chose d\u00e9montre une nouvelle fois l'incomp\u00e9tence totale du plus gros de la \"presse\" vid\u00e9oludique. J'en avais d\u00e9j\u00e0 parl\u00e9 avec Thief, o\u00f9 les imb\u00e9ciles ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'ils \u00e9taient autant des joueurs que je suis le dernier antipape puisqu'AUCUN d'entre eux n'a test\u00e9 le jeu au-dessus de Normal. Et que PERSONNE de normalement constitu\u00e9 ne joue \u00e0 Thief en Normal. Depuis la nuit des temps.\n\nIci c'est pareil. Il a d'ailleurs directement re\u00e7u une dose tout \u00e0 fait correcte de flak pour ses conneries sur les contr\u00f4les (qui, tout comme pour son pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur, sont au-dessus de TOUT reproche, M\u00caME au clavier). \n\nQu'y a-t-il \u00e0 dire sur Escape Goat 2 ? Que c'est Escape Goat en plus.\nPlus beau.\nPlus chaud.\nPlus ardu.\nPlus long.\nPlus mieux.\n\nUn coup d'\u0153il au trailer, aux screenshots, suffit \u00e0 constater le premier point.\n\nPlus chaud, parce que mine de rien, ce changement apporte \u00e9norm\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'ambiance, et donne r\u00e9ellement aux tableaux, en particulier les zones les plus color\u00e9es, une impression de chaleur. On est bien chez soi, quand m\u00eame.\n\nPlus ardu... Oui oui. Pas que le squelette soit plus ignoble, non. \u00c7a reste Escape Goat, avec des ajouts et des nouvelles m\u00e9caniques tout \u00e0 fait standards, et la courbe d'apprentissage est toujours l\u00e9ch\u00e9e comme les bottes d'un sup\u00e9rieur hi\u00e9rarchique. Non, ce qui le rend plus ardu, c'est le reste. Une fois termin\u00e9 le jeu (je sch\u00e9matise, vous pouvez commencer plus t\u00f4t, mais soit), chaque zone vous offrira une seconde partie plus difficile que celle que vous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 travers\u00e9e, et mettra \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve ce que vous savez des rouages du jeu. C'est un plaisir qui n'\u00e9tait pas aussi fort dans Escape Goat, o\u00f9 la difficult\u00e9 faisait un bond qui pouvait en rebuter certains. Ici, vous pouvez tout \u00e0 fait sauter d'une zone \u00e0 l'autre pour vous essayer \u00e0 un autre puzzle si vous bloquez, et il faut bien avouer que \u00e7a fait du bien.\nEt puis, il y a les pi\u00e8ces secr\u00e8tes. M\u00eame si vous terminez toutes ces secondes parties de zones, vous constaterez que vous en \u00eates \u00e0 moins de 90% du jeu. Ces pi\u00e8ces secr\u00e8tes sont les niveaux les plus difficiles du jeu et vous demanderont une ma\u00eetrise compl\u00e8te de la b\u00eate, tant dans le gameplay que dans les rouages. Fort heureusement, il n'y en a pas des centaines. C'est l\u00e0 qu'Escape Goat 2 pourrait vous faire ragequitter. Bref, c'est du tout bon, d'autant que RIEN ne vous oblige \u00e0 passer par tout \u00e7a.\n\nPlus long, justement \u00e0 cause de toutes ces pi\u00e8ces optionnelles. Entendons-nous bien : si vous ne faites m\u00eame pas les secondes parties de zones, le jeu est plus COURT qu'Escape Goat ; vous pourriez m\u00eame regretter votre investissement. Mais honn\u00eatement, si telle est votre intention, pourquoi m\u00eame faire l'effort de lire une review ? Vous me direz, y'a les puzzles de la communaut\u00e9 aussi... Mais y'a l'air d'y avoir pas mal de gros acharn\u00e9s par ici. M\u00e9fiez-vous. \n\nPlus mieux, donc. Plus mieux \u00e0 tous les \u00e9tages, et m\u00eame plus mieux par sa longueur adaptable \u00e0 vos envies et besoins, et allongeable \u00e0 l'envi.\n\nPour le reste, vous pouvez tout \u00e0 fait vous r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 ma review d'Escape Goat, vous saurez de quoi il retourne (si vous n'y avez pas jou\u00e9, auquel cas QU'EST-CE QUE VOUS FOUTEZ ICI ?)\n\nEn conclusion : Escape Goat 2 maintient le titre et l'AOC du jeu. Plus qu'\u00e0 attendre le 3.\n\nPS - Dear Destructoid pseudo-reviewer, die in a fire, kthxbye. 11/10, would b(l)eat again.", "timestamp_created": 1402734068, "timestamp_updated": 1402735486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.638129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10455596": {"recommendationid": "10455596", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993105998", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427076349}, "language": "english", "review": "Jesus, this game.

First, at being a good challenge that causes you to think about your approach to dozens of levels instead of just roaming through and pressing buttons. Secondly, and here\u2019s the catch, also at being fun whilst doing so.\n\nWhenever you make a mistake in this game, you know it\u2019s usually your own fault and you mutter unmentionables under your breath before you willingly try again \u2013 because it\u2019s fun.\n\nThere are times when, in levels with multiple buttons all being required to be pressed in order to activate something, it\u2019s not very intuitive as to letting you know what it will accomplish and you\u2019ll need to find the solution behind pressing all the buttons before you\u2019re thrown into a second task in the same place. I think this was actually the idea behind the design, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m incredibly fond of it. Sometimes, things move simultaneously at multiple points on the map and it can be a bit much to take in. It feels like the workings of the level aren\u2019t entirely in your control, which is something the game is otherwise very good at not doing.\n\nThere are a few times here and there where you\u2019ve made the right decision and have been thrown off the trail by chance bad feedback, either through a Reaper facing the wrong way at the wrong time, or your button press being just a miniscule portion off where it should have been. As such it\u2019s a good idea to try an idea a couple of times before you give up on a notion.\n\nNot to throw you off though \u2013 these things only stand out as bad because they\u2019re the odd ones out in an otherwise great game. The puzzles never seemed completely beyond me, but never did it feel like it wasn\u2019t challenging. For the most part, the only stages that don\u2019t cause you to stop and think about your approach are the ones that are introducing new ideas, and you can be sure that that means more interesting challenges ahead. Occasionally, you can find yourself overthinking a puzzle because extra bits and pieces were placed for the sole purpose of throwing you off the scent. Toward the end of the game, there\u2019s a set of levels designed to make you react very quickly, and the true challenge is being able to work under pressure.  It\u2019s a refreshing switch-up.\n\nThe whole theme is friendly. You\u2019re a goat with your sidekick (occasionally magical) mouse, out rescuing sheep in a big castle with scary monsters. What on Earth isn\u2019t to like about that?\n\nOh, and allow me to just throw this out there. You will die in this game. A lot. This will bring you back to the beginning of a level (which are never incredibly long, but it can feel frustrating to have to redo that thing you finally did right after trying and failing at least ten times first). There\u2019s even a hotkey for making your Goat explode and die to restart the level quicker. You\u2019ll be using that button a lot. Several functions rely on your trial and error because they\u2019d be impossible to figure out the first time. Try not to let it get to you.\n\nThe music is fitting and blends into the background well. It keeps you from getting bored and doesn\u2019t feel incredibly tedious. Otherwise it\u2019s unremarkable.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that whoever is behind this game must have played Pok\u00e9mon Silver & Gold as a child, because I drew correlations between three particular puzzles in this game and puzzles from The Underground, Cianwood City Gym, and Ice Path. I thought that was interesting.\n\nI completed the game in 7h40m over the course of about a week (apparently mine was a slow playthrough), but like a frickin hour of that was on the last level. Just finished that one now. Sheesh. I died 625 times overall, which I believe averages a death every 44 seconds.\nThere are also apparently secret puzzles which I haven\u2019t discovered, so I look forward to trying them out and scraping up all the (majority of) achievements I didn\u2019t achieve through my playthrough.\n\nIf you like puzzle games, I have very little doubt that you will love this one to death whist you occasionally pull your hair out.

The sawblades and the reapers are back, and that's it - apart from the snake-boss (whose levels I didn't enjoy, because they were too fiddly).  How about some different classes of reapers, at the least?\n\n- some of the levels are way too tricky, while most are plain sailing (can be done within a couple of tries).  I wonder how many of those really tough levels were beta-tested?  Because the timing required on some of them is outrageous.  A couple involve your goat being stuck at the bottom of the screen on a platform which is decaying or otherwise moving out from under you.  If you jump too soon, you die; if you hesitate, you fall and die; and, if you jump incorrectly (by not hitting a high-enough jump or by brushing against a tiny pixel) you are blocked from completing the jump (and then you fall and die).  In desperation on those levels, I looked up how the YouTube experts did it, but replicating the same feat is another matter.  I always say it with puzzlers: if you can see how something is meant to be done yet can't replicate it within an hour of trying, the game has failed.  Or should be labelled: only for kids with catlike reflexes.  :(\n\nNiggles aside, I had a blast with the majority of the game, \"finishing\" it in around 7hrs (87% completion, it says, but more than enough to get to the outro).", "timestamp_created": 1396699519, "timestamp_updated": 1396699519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561730", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9719935": {"recommendationid": "9719935", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994121873", "num_games_owned": 578, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404433927}, "language": "english", "review": "Just like first game, Escape Goat 2 is a delightful game.

There's a strange diffculty curve in some levels where you might spend ten minutes on one level figuring out what to do, then the next might take you two minutes. Either way the puzzles are interesting enough that you might even take some of them on in different ways, rather than going through what the game intends you to. The graphics are way better than the first, moving from pixel graphics to fancy drawn graphics and neat little idle animations. Soundtrack is also really amazing.

It has been confirmed that the Level Editor is coming. So scratch that complaint. The game also (SPOILERS!!) do implement some new features, and is significantly larger than the first game. So i am changing this to a recommend. My stance on the graphic withstands none the less.\n\nStay clear!! If you own the original Escape Goat, don\u00b4t buy this. If you don\u00b4t own the original, buy that instead of this downgrade.\n\nBy all means an inferior game than the original Escape Goat, which i absolutely adored. From what i can concern, there is absolutely no new features what so ever. Calling it a sequel is actually misleading, since it\u00b4s the exact same game but with LESS content. You read that part correctly, Escape Goat 2 is LESS of a game than it\u00b4s predecessor. Why? Because the developer (s) removed the Level Editor! The original boasted an easy to use, yet extremely powerful level editor that allowed you to create anything the original campaign could offer. You could even create your own campaign by chaining the levels together. Escape Goat 2 have no level editor what so ever.\n\nThat\u00b4s right, they removed the ONE feature that allowed a wonderful community to grow up around this game. Maybe they realised that a level editor would make any DLC obsolete. Worse yet, well no not worse, the omission of the level editor is the main offender, but the new graphics aren\u00b4t really up to snuff.\n\nThe original had pixel perfect, atmospheric and gorgeous sprite art. The sequel is still made out of sprites, but it is all convoluted in an unnecessary comic look. The original had a sense of mystique, an omnious almost gothic vibe. This game looks like your random, kid friendly iOS game. To add insult to injury, the lightning effects obscures the playing field. It\u00b4s not always clear what is what, and while it certainly ain\u00b4t no big problem, the new graphics diminished the enjoyment of the game, at least in my case. It\u00b4s also unnecessary demanding! The first game i could run on my MacAir with perfect framerate and hardly any CPU usage. This game chugs even at the lowest graphics setting, and is setting my fan on fire.\n\nSo there you go. Take a game with a wonderful premise, because the basic gameplay behind Escape Goat is truly amazing, disguise it in less beautiful and more demanding graphics. Remove half of the content. (One could argue the level editor was more than half really), and up the price. And there you have it folks.

Escape Goat 2 is basically more of the same, which is not a bad thing. It offers a nice balance of platforming and solving intelligent puzzles. The controls and mechanics are just great. Really nothing to complain about here.\n\nThe difficulty is very low in the first few levels and always gets a little higher from level to level. Nobody should have any problems getting into the game. And yet it is quite challenging later on. Escape Goat 1 offered some high difficulty levels after beating the campaign. I expect the successor to offer the same (I didn't beat it yet, so I just can assume it will).\n\nThe main difference to the first part is the graphics style. Instead of the basic pixel art we got in Escape Goat 1, this game now uses a new high definition graphics style, which many people will like. I personally prefer the old art style, but I am fine with either of them. The most important thing for me is, that the controls didn't change at all. Despite the new graphics the game feels absolutely like the first part. Not all games manage to do that.\n\nI like it a lot. Both Escape Goat games are real indie gems.

Along the way you meet various friends like a mouse, who travels along with you and is a crucial part of gameplay, as well as sheep, who have gotten lost in the fortress and need to be rescued.\n\nQ2.5: What is the gameplay like?/Is it fun?\nThe gameplay of Escape Goat 2 is phenomenal, calling upon both your reflexes and problem solving skills. The controls are fairly simple: the goat can jump, double jump, and dash. Dashing is used to break boxes or push blocks, or simply as a quick traversal technique. But what really makes the gameplay shine is the mouse character. When you release the mouse, either by throwing it upward or in front of you, he sticks to the wall and climbs around the walls until you call him back. This is incredibly useful for hitting switches that are out of reach or for baiting enemies. The enemies also play a large part in the puzzle solving, the most common enemy type throwing fire at the goat or mouse when they see them, which can be either a hazard or a tool to open new pathways. But the main new gameplay feature of Escape Goat 2 in comparison to its predecessor is that you can obtain various powers for your mouse. I don\u2019t want to spoil all the powers, but the first one you\u2019ll encounter is the Magic Hat, which allows the goat and mouse to switch places. In addition to being able to access areas which are too small to enter as a goat or have been closed off by the fortress\u2019s mechanisms, you can also destroy enemies or boxes in a line between the goat and mouse as they swap places. And that\u2019s just the beginning of the puzzling possibilities. Escape Goat 2 is a game that encourages experimentation, giving only the bare minimum of tutorials; that is, at various points in the levels it suggests you press a button and then you just see what happens. Everything else is left up to your skill as a gamer. It\u2019s rare that there\u2019s only one way to solve any given puzzle, and that freedom is very refreshing, if sometimes a bit frustrating until you figure out what to do. But those are some of the best moments in gaming.\n\nQ3: What is the graphical style/presentation like?\nThe graphics of Escape Goat 2 are great. When compared to the original Escape Goat, they\u2019re on a whole new level, going from rough pixel art to hand-illustrated art. The graphics are fairly standard as far as modern 2D platformers go, but the characters are very smoothly animated and a lot of detail was put into the mechanisms and gears in the fortress. Each zone in the fortress has its own unique visual identity as well, from the Woods of Duplicity to the Halls of Gleaming Crystal. The entire game somehow manages to give off a \u201cmysterious\u201d vibe. The music in the game is also appropriately atmospheric for each zone, and it\u2019s pretty catchy too.\n\nQ4: What control methods does it allow?\nThe game can be controlled with either an Xbox 360 controller, which is the recommended control method, or with the keyboard. I didn\u2019t get the chance to try it with a controller, but the keyboard was definitely usable enough with the default settings, and the keys are fully remappable, so that\u2019s really all I can ask for.\n\nQ5: What kind of replayability does the game offer?\nI beat the main game, that is, escaped the fortress, in just over 2 hours. However, that was after only discovering 45.45% of the rooms, or so the results screen told me. Any level in the game can be replayed via the map system, and extensions to each zone are unlocked as you progress through the game. And boy, are these extra levels tough! I haven\u2019t been able to beat all of them yet, but I can already tell that all of you puzzle-platformer fanatics are in for a treat!\nIn addition, a level editor will be added post-launch, with which you can create and share your own levels, for potentially infinite replayability.\n\nQ6: Is the game worth a purchase?\nIf you\u2019re a fan of platforming and puzzles, and you\u2019re not afraid of a challenge, I highly recommend you pick up this game. It\u2019s available on Windows, Mac, and Linux on Steam, Good Old Games, and The Humble Store.", "timestamp_created": 1395680695, "timestamp_updated": 1395680695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.445369", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9619974": {"recommendationid": "9619974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023555368", "num_games_owned": 1621, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 1263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1396230192}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]This is the way sequels should be made.

The story is richer (especially for a puzzle game), the gameplay is a lot more varied, and the puzzles offer even more profound \"Ah ha!\" moments than the first game.\n\nThe system for moving between levels is much better this time around. If you get stuck you can easily pull up the new overworld map system and go back to any other puzzle--no more need to start rooms over at the first puzzle just to get to that fifth puzzle again.\n\nRegarding story, the original Escape Goat didn't have much--which was part of its appeal. You won't find anything too deep here but there is more this time around. If you talk to all of the animals you'll get quite a bit more backstory and world history. I found myself feeling excited to beat the next section of levels so that I could see what would happen next; the game did a good job at keeping me coming back for more.\n\nThe art is fantastic, I enjoy the attention to detail and the new lighting engine adds a lot of depth to the feeling of the game.

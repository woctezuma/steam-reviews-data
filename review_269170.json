Posh! A perfect simulation of an adult Chucky Cheese.[/u] For real, this is premium VR content. Prolly one of the best 20 VR titles atm. I just got out of this experience after hanging out for an hour! Watch my video; I did everything, and there was a few other players whose party I crashed. (Both he and the AI won the game of pool).\n\nFirst, I played the tutorial, which is like your own personal area with each game for you to practice on. Then you enter the main bar, which is much larger. It is quite expansive and has decent looking NPC/models, which I was a nice touch, and I think that gives just about any VR experience a greater sense of presence, even if they just stand around. There is a VIP room, and a nice unlock system. You play skeeball (and such) and reclaim the tickets for useless junk, just like in an actual arcade. [i]All of this, combined with multiplayer and the actual pool/billiards component (which is executed perfectly) gives it a strong replay value.[/i]\n\nThis game has been around for along time. It used to be called Pool Nation, did you know that? Now you do! I checked out back then and the main area looks familiar to what there is here, and it's still the same thing, but like double the content. I sheepishly waited for a sale (It's still 33% off), but you can buy it at full price without worry. This should compete with full on VR social platforms. For VR titles where only like 2-10 people on the entire planet will be playing at one time, they should put you in a multiplayer session by default, eh? Has anyone ever tried that?

TVs everywhere to watch your favourite sports and plenty of games to play.  You can\u2019t miss it! Put on your VR headset and it should be right in front of you! Come on in and let\u2019s have fun at SportsBar VR.\n\nSportsBar VR is a casual / sports simulation game where you immerse yourself in a virtual bar and play a variety games, the likes of which can be found in real bars and clubs. \n\nWhat a cool bar we have here \u2013 there\u2019s an old-style jukebox in the corner, several pool tables in from the bar. Oh, have a look at this! Let\u2019s play rampball, darts, air hockey . . . what\u2019s that? You want to play chess? Be my guest, here is a chess table and right beside it a checkers table, too. I\u2019m off play to something else for a while. \n\nThere are fun games in this venue and the most important point is that they are easy to play with the Vive controllers. I had a few turns at pool and air hockey against online opponents and I must admit it was fun. I really like the feel of pool cane - I was surprised how realistic it was; just brilliant!\n\nThe rampball was ok; you have nine balls and if you reckon you\u2019re a top baller, show us how to get nine hundred points with nine balls \u2013 I\u2019d love to see that!  The darts game was ok, too, but I personally did not like the feel when you throw the darts; you either throw them too softly or too hard, the motion is not quite there in my opinion. I was better at throwing darts at the balloons and seeing them fly into the air! As for the air hockey, that was good too, as I mentioned above, but it took me a while to get properly used to the mallet - it could be a little bit smoother. \n\nThere are also objects that you can pick up to throw at people, or even build a house of chairs, books, dominos or cans of beer. Yes, there are bottles of beer that you can smash against the wall, but I prefer to juggle with them!\nYou\u2019ll receive presents too; how nice is that? With these you came customize how people see you online. There is also the option to upload your own music.\n\nSportsBar is graphically polished.  The controls with the pool game are great but need to be better for the darts and the rampball in my opinion.  The atmosphere is spot on and now I can go to a bar without leaving home - safer and healthier. \n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tPolished Graphics\n-\tSeveral games to play\n-\tGreat atmosphere\n-\tAchievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tControls could be better in some games\n-\tNo trading cards\n\nThe bar atmosphere is well done. Are you ready for a game of pool, darts, chess and more? Take your pick, mate - we\u2019ll be waiting for you!\n\n6/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

The experience feels like you are walking into your own bar without smelling like a lot of cheap booze, the feeling of sticky floors, and coming out with clothes reaking of dirty smoke. \n\nThe pool, airhockey, and table shuffleboard games are very good as far as realism and physics, darts seemed ok, other games like skeeball are not very realistic at all.  Skeeball tables I found very disappointing.  They feel too high and don't feel like the floorbase ones you find in most arcade centers.   There was something about the ball movement that did not feel like it had the right roll as far as weight, gravity, and speed.  It also did not feel like it had the right pop you feel with a wooden ball when it goes into the air and then bounces around.\n\nI understand this simulator is best for its pool table simulation and not the other games that are included.  I refunded the game because I felt the game was too empty being a single player.  The game felt hard to come back to for replayability.  I didn't see many people online to play multiplayer and I felt very bored after awhile walking around an empty bar.   This will be a great simulation if more people can be found playing.  There is an area in the game where alot of AI are standing about but, I didn't find a way to play single player against AI, other than shooting pool by myself.  \n\nI recommend this game if you want to shoot pool with some friends and they are willing to join and play with you.  If you are single player and looking for others to play, you will get bored rather quickly.  The other games included (other than the pool) don't feel as refined to real world physics as the pool simulation does.   Hopefully they will improve the physics to make the other games included feel just as real.  I will definatley keep my eye out to play this game in the future as it improves.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1487731453, "timestamp_updated": 1487731453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30064884": {"recommendationid": "30064884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198258374", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501611896}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy bueno  super realista ,,aunque creo que deverian de pulir y centrarse mas en las mesas  ya que el juego es de billar,,y hay muchas cosas que sobran .por ej..ponen unos dardos que los tiras y ni se ven ..y algo muy fundamental es colocarle unaS MANOS AL JUGADOR ..ALGO OVIO", "timestamp_created": 1487620138, "timestamp_updated": 1487620138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30037680": {"recommendationid": "30037680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278904140", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512876045}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the ultimate man cave.

That decision cost me $20 because now that I've played it (and spent an hour trying), I wish like hell I could return it. I'm more than decent at billiards; bar table or 9ft, 8-ball or 9-ball, house cue or my own; I can run a table well enough and in this \"game\", I was lucky to sink a single shot. A large part of that is the fact that I'm hovering in space, not setting up a bridge on a real table so it's inherently unstable. The \"lock\" system would take care of that, except that there's not a stable way to get a shot setup and nothing to even assist in that such as a dampened movement system (something between the free and locked modes perhaps?). While walking around, the graphics are pretty, but that's about the only good thing I can say about this and I SO wanted to love it.\n\nMulti-player seems to be a bust too. I waited at least 30 minutes for a 9-ball game and never got an opponent.\n\nAll that might have even been tollerable if I didn't have those damn \"lock\" dialogs in my face the whole time. There was a settings option to turn off hints, but that didn't remove them and there wasn't much else to tweak. The same issue made darts impossible because the dialog was between my face and the dart board.\n\nDon't waste your money. RecRoom is free and though it doesn't have billiards, it's infinitely more entertaining and has a lively crowd (sometimes too lively).

The ball physics are good, and you can turn on cue ball spin. There's an AI player to play against, but even a low level 1 AI will sometimes run the whole table off the break and do trick shots. (I swear the AI is hustlin' me!)\nYou can also queue to find a random live human player, and this game really shines when playing with a real person with the voice-chat on. You really get the sense of presence that you're both together in a poolhall and not in your living room (or where ever your PC is) somewhere unknown.\nThere's an XP bar and levels for your account, leveling up unlocks cosmetics: hats, cue stick colors/types/art, and table felt art.\n\nTo move around you can walk around via your roomscale space, teleport (with a sticky option to get you at the edge of the table, very handy), and grip & push/pull the world around you which is nice to get right into position.\n\nDefinitely a must-have VR game for me.\nWorth $20, especially if you compare the

And that's enough to remind me of weekends hanging out at Rusty's Billiards. \n\nThe coolest thing is, you could play darts if you wanted to, you can change the music on the jukebox (though it seems like they only have a handful of songs), you can conjure yourself up a beer... bottle.  It's empty though, so no getting virtually drunk and starting a virtual bar fight.\n\nThere's also a multiplayer mode which I have yet to try but it looks great.  There's only one thing missing:  Something to lean on as you make your shots.  If I had a real world \"surrogate table\" to play against, this game would be so very awesome.   It's still great though, don't get me wrong.  It just kinda ruins the immersion when you have to hover your arms in the air while taking a shot.  \n\nThings I liked about this game: \n[list]\n [*] They really nailed the bar atmosphere.  The only thing that would make it more authentic would be to have it filled with smoke and have some arcade games off in the corner... Oh and maybe a selection of cue sticks to choose from and some chalk for the tip of your cue.\n [*] The tables are my favorite color for pool tables (though I could see some people wanting the traditional green felt)\n [*] Darts!  \n [*] They give you 8 ball and 9 ball at least. I would like more game options (rotation? Straight pool?) but 8 and 9 ball are a good start.\n [*] Makes good use of all the available room scale game space\n[/list]\n\nThings I didn't like: \n[list]\n [*] Aiming without something to lean on is really awkward and ruins the immersion (This is not really the game's fault though)\n [*] The people seem to be a BIT on the small side.  Like the height is ok, but their body size is super skinny...  it's a small complaint really because the main focus is the game, not the people standing around, but I feel like they could make the people a bit wider.  Imagine a 5'2\" girl stretched out to 5'6\" and that's how it seems  Squish her height back down to 5'2\" and she looks fine, but stretched out she seems unnaturally skinny...uncanny valley style.\n [*] Only two pool games (8 and 9 ball) and the dart game seems like there's not much to it yet other than throw the darts and look at the score on the wall.\n[/list]\n\nI really didn't have that many complaints with this game, except for the AI really is kinda lame at the easiest level, but it always is... I feel like the AI lets me win on the easiest level, and the level 3 AI is the closest to the real \"novice\" player. \n\nSo anyway, my recommendation is: find something like a barstool to lean on so you can take your shots more realistically.  Don't forget to pick it up and carry it with you (or else teleport everywhere) or you might be tempted to put your hand down on thin air and fall to the floor.\n\nThis game is definitely worth buying.", "timestamp_created": 1469252152, "timestamp_updated": 1469254372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550709", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24470228": {"recommendationid": "24470228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016763999", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 75, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504358492}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u65b9\u4fbf\u5feb\u6377\u7684\u8054\u673a\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u662f\u672c\u4f5c\u6700\u5927\u7684\u4eae\u70b9\u4e86\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u73a9\u7684\u4eba\u633a\u591a\u7684\uff0c\u8054\u901a\u7f51\u7edc\u51e0\u4e4e\u90fd\u662f\u79d2\u8fde\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u65f6\u7528VIVE\u81ea\u5e26MIC\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u548c\u5bf9\u65b9\u4ea4\u6d41\u5373\u53ef\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u65b9\u4fbf\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u8001\u5916\u591a\u56fd\u4eba\u5c11\uff0c\u671f\u5f85\u9047\u89c1\u56fd\u4eba\u5427\u3002\n\u8bbe\u7f6e\u83dc\u5355\u91cc\u53ef\u8c034\u6321\u753b\u8d28\uff1a\u4f4e\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u9ad8\u3001\u6781\u9ad8\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9009\u9879\u4e0b\u76f4\u63a5\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u5e27\u6570\uff0c\u6211\u7684GTX 1080\u7adf\u7136\u8dd1\u4e86\u4e0d\u6781\u9ad8\u753b\u8d28\uff0c\u6709\u70b9\u7eb3\u95f7\uff0c\u6781\u9ad8\u65f6\u5e27\u6570\u4e5f\u5c31\u572875-85\u5e27\u5de6\u53f3\u8df3\u52a8\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0cVR\u6e38\u620f\u5fc5\u987b\u6ee1\u8db3\u7a33\u5b9a90\u5e27\u624d\u4e0d\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u5361\u987f\u5bfc\u81f4\u5934\u6655\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u964d\u5230\u4e86\u9ad8\u753b\u8d28\u3002\n\n\u603b\u7ed3\uff1a\u6bcf\u5929\u548c\u5168\u7403\u5404\u5730\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u6765\u51e0\u5c40\u8fd8\u662f\u633a\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u6c1b\u56f4\u8f7b\u677e\u60ec\u610f\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1469235563, "timestamp_updated": 1469235563, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595376", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24455907": {"recommendationid": "24455907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312432276", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480168346}, "language": "schinese", "review": "Very realistic simulation of reality.

This is easily THE BEST BUY for Vive now bar none. The only way you could fail to get good value from this buy is if you hate billiards.

They recently added in air hockey, there's a set of large dominos you can setup and tip over, and a digital dart board (that said, throwing darts in VR is anything but easy. Well, throwing them is easy, throwing them accurately...not so much).\n\nThe physics on the ball are good, and supposedly if you turn off ghost ball and some other feature you unlock 'pro mode' where the ball physics are more or less perfect to real life (the only issues you'll have with ghost ball on will be trying to do backspin across half a table length or more; it won't curve durng the shot as it would IRL).\n\nEnglish (the ball physics property, not the language) is supported, so you can safely backspin a pocket shot to recall a ball across the table or avoid pocketing the cue ball. Jump shots also exist. Oh, and the AI has many small increments. You'll find an AI opponent that fits your skill level, I promise.

The update today hopefully addressed that issue. I have a GTX 970 video card so maybe that is the reason for not optimal visuals but VR devs need to support at least down to these cards since a lot of people have them I think. The physics in the game are pretty good also. You can do most of the tricks you do in real life in VR.\nAir Hockey is live now and it is fun but again there is a small learning curve since you can't actually hold the strikers. Also, today's update you should be able to use a real table (as a pool table) and set up the height so you can use it to play on when in game. I have a short video of the Air Hockey and already have a video up on Steam and YouTube of the pool play. Have fun in the bar.\nhttps://youtu.be/V9wlIbQfNtY\n\nUpdate to my review: I have a GTX 1070 and the graphics still look the same. I only get 45fps on high and ultra. When I look close at things they are very clear. Why can't they just make it so when you look from afar it is still clear? The whole bar has a blur to it. Other games can do clear so I don't understand their method of coding in this game. You may ask why I don't turn the settings to medium or low? Well because the game looks worse at those levels even though the FPS is higher.\n\nThe devs just added more graphical tweaking settings to the game. Finally.

A full physics engine lets you mess around with basically anything in the environment in some cool ways.  Menus are a breeze to navigate.

I don't know if these skills I'm gaining would transfer that well back to real life, but I have a feeling at least the knowledge I'm gaining would.  At the very least, I can already feel a real sense of progression in my ability after only playing a dozen or so games of this and that feels great. \n\nNow if the developers could just find a way to make self aware AI for the sole purpose of letting me make my opponents feel shame when I beat the AI.  I want that birthday hat wearing bastard to feel HUMILIATION when I take him down.\n\nPros:\n\n-Great looking game with a nice hazy hool hall atmosphere; amazing in VR\n-Great online multilplayer.  Finding random games or inviting friends to play is a breeze and very snappy.\n-Great unlock system with hats, new pool tables, cues, etc.\n-Great inuitive controls that feel very natural\n-Nice assists for new pool player such as the ghost ball telling you where your ball will hit before you shoot.\n\nCons:\n\n-Could use some sort of Single player ladder/tournament (right now just AI matches which are still a good deal more fun than you'd expect though)\n-Only two players per game/lobby.  It would be great to let more people hang out in a game/hall or have multiple games going on in the same space.\n-No Self Aware AI to make victory over robot overlords feel totally sweet. \n\nIf you have a Vive this game should probably be in your library.

What really makes this game shine is its one of a kind, holy-crap-this-is-the-future multiplayer. You and one other player can walk around the pool hall, play darts, throw bottles at each other, and of course... shoot some pool. What makes this experience unique is how immersive and how realistic the other player's movements translate into their avatar. I played against a total stranger.

Otherwise, get this right now.[/h1]\n\nIt's an amazing experience. I got so immersed in my game that I find myself leaning over the table, barely able to reach the cue ball, just to get a shot in. The table isn't there, of course, and I could just walk through the table to easily shoot. But because I felt like I was in a bar, and I felt like I was playing pool in real life, I found myself leaning. It's great.\n\nThe game is very nice, graphically. The sound is good, with the thuds and scratches of the pool balls sounding realistic. There are jukeboxes in the bar, but there isn't a whole lot of song selections. I didn't mess with it myself, so there may be more options available than I'm not aware of.\n\nAs far as the gameplay is concerned, it feels very fluid, and the controls are fairly simple to learn. Having to aim both the cue ball and where you're going to strike the cue ball itself is a little tricky, I've found, but that's more of a player being bad kind of thing and not the games fault. There's single player, with multiple levels of difficulty to choose from, and multiplayer. I've played a few games of multiplayer, and it was a great experience. There were no hitches, both of us moved fluidly, and the voice chat worked flawlessly.\n\nI did experience a few bugs, though, such as the game telling me I was supposed to hit the solid balls, but then calling a foul on me for hitting the wrong balls (I was actually stripes). A few times the game called a foul on me for scratching the cue ball (hitting it into the pocket) when I didn't. But these experiences only happened one time each, and I feel that they'll be fixed soon.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough. If you're not a fan of pool, then the novelty of being in a bar, throwing objects around and playing darts isn't going to last you long enough to justify buying the product. But if you are a fan, or even if you don't really like or dislike pool, you should get this.

If you have a small-ish VR space like I do, this game will definitely make you wish for larger space so you don't have to teleport for every shot.\n\nBut, its just pool. There's no crazy game modes or anything.  This isn't a complaint, but its important to know this game is faithful to real pool rules and  a high level of pool simulation.  Personally, I find it very relaxing, but I can see how others might find it boring after a while.  I have read the devs want to add more mini games. Currently you can play darts in the virtual pool hall. I guess we'll see when that stuff comes out and how it affects the game.  I would love a real human avatar, but asking for that kind of thing this early in VR might be too much. \n\nStill, highly recommended. \n\nOne caveat: Your mic is on by default in this game and it is not push to talk.

Im running on a 980ti with a 4790k and have to set the graphics to medium or high. Medium is fine, High stutters somewhat, Ultra isn't usable with about 40 frames per second. I would apprecciate if the developers could tweak the engine somewhat more, because it look awsome in ultra and the immersion it the best I've ever seen on my Vive (or even the Rift)\n\nThis game is a masterpiece for Roomscale VR, it's a must have. I won't say it's a system seller, as pool isn't for everyone, but it's very near that.\n\nI feel so much like in a bar playing pool billard, that I often tried to lean on the table, be carefull, you'll fall over onto your nose ;)\n\nSound is good, physics seem very realistic, though the AI is a little bit too good, even at lowest setting it's very hard to beat them.\n\nHaven't tried multiplayer yet, I'm satisfied with singleplayer until now.

I've had to settle for smoky bars with questionable bathrooms to get my 'shark fix. ... for the record, I'm terrible at pool, but I think it's great.\n\nIf you have any interest at all in pool or VR, this game is for you. In fact, when I heard about it, before I had even purchased the Vive, I was like \"That game ... now that is a good reason to have VR.\" And now it's out, and yes. It is.\n\nYeah, you won't be leaning on the side of the pool table to set up your shots. When my roommate and I first booted the game up, I actually got on my knees and yoga'd myself into a tabletop for him to set up his shot. We quickly stopped that though, and not only because it would have been super weird if anyone walked by and looked in the window*, but because the game's clever controls negate the need for you to set your wrist on anything.\n\nIn 'cue' mode, your two hands are placed naturally upon a pool cue, and squeezing the left hand trigger \"locks\" the angle and position of your stick. Then you can use your right hand to control the speed (and thus power) of your shot. It works wonderfully.\n\nYou can kneel down and get a line of sight with the cue ball. You can lean all around the table. Walk around it as far as your room-scale setup allows. The teleportation handily locks onto the edge of the table if you aim at it, and always orients you so you're facing a sensible direction. Pro-tip: You can also squeeze both grips to \"pull\" the scenery around you. (This is super weird at first, but actually SUPER useful and I wish more games had this feature.)\n\nYou're not limited to teleporting just around the table. No no. You have full freedom to roam the bar. The atmosphere really does capture the feeling of a poolshark-type joint, with a bunch of glowing TVs above the bar, a jukebox (which you can lift over your head like a beast, but not load your own music into, unfortunately), darts (and a dartboard to throw at), beer bottles to throw and break, and lots of other fun things to discover. The NPCs are dumb, and don't do anything at all, but entertaining to look at. Partly because they're the dumbest thing in the place.\n\nThe first night my roommate and I got this we only did the 'free play' mode. We basically just traded wearing the headset every time it was the other person's turn. This worked beautifully, and allowed for lots and lots of sipping a beverage of your choice between shots. (Dev request: please enable this to run in full-screen in mirrored mode! Window is too small!) In general this worked just great. It felt like we actually walked into a bar and just started playing around with a table; there were no rules imposed whatsoever. I DO wish that it showed you which balls were already sunk, or had a basic local scorekeeping mode, but frankly it worked so well that we played for basically five hours. This is by far the most seductive VR game right now; we've easily put more hours into this in a night than anything else yet.\n\nThat was yesterday. Today, then, this was the first game I booted up after work and I decided to try an online match. It was an absolute blast. I met a stranger who had played a couple more games online than me, but not many. It had this crazy effect that so far I've only experienced in BigScreen, where it really feels like the other person is there with you. I felt my body language shifting like we were both in the room. I found myself gesturing naturally and laughing a LOT. (It could have had something to do with playing with beer bottles in a vulgar way ... nah, it was just everything.)\n\nAs of this writing, the VR crowd is still so selective. The few people I met when i booted up BigScreen the other night were really cool. Lots of similar interests. I love the idea of the LAN party thing, but we ended up just chilling. Pool Nation VR is even better, because you're actually sharing an activity \u2014 a fantastic activity. I almost asked for a friend request from the person I played my first game with... it was just a very natural, very fun, fantastic time. \n\nOh yeah, and the multiplayer gameplay is great. It basically has the scoring system I wanted when I played free play for five hours. And of course you can explore the bar with your buddy and do whatever you want. You're not stuck to the table at all.\n\nAs far as performance goes, I put it on Low straight away. There's a nifty FPS meter that updates on the settings screen. I have a GTX 970 and an i2500-k, and this game usually hovers in the 80-90 range with my rig. Not a solid 90, unfortunately, but the developers seem to be focusing on performance issues, so I'm hopeful it will be ironed out soon enough. In any case, it's not a dealbreaker at all.\n\nThe person I was playing with had a 1080 card and he said that on the very highest settings the FPS were poor compared to most anything else he's tried, but again, the devs are looking into it.\n\nAnyway, get this game.\n\n* Yes, someone did see us playing Vive through the window the other night. They definitely wanted to come in and play. There was that look of longing. Aw, guy, come back.

You spawn into a bar with weird npcs silently dancing/shuffling in the corner, TVs showing ads for a pool game, a jukebox, dartboard, and of course the pool table. \nThe default quality setting of medium did not allow me to hit 90 fps so the reprojection was kicking in and fps was 45. Turning the quality to low, while sacrificing some visual fidelity, allowed my system to consistently hit 90 fps with a minor hit to graphics. \nThe main attraction for this game is the multiplayer. \nAfter starting a game and getting someone to join it becomes a very interesting social experiment. I have played with many people, the vast majority either have their mic muted or have not figured out how to setup the vive mic. Others speak languages that I have no clue what they are saying. A handful have actually spoken Enligsh (I am a stupid American and don't know many languages) and that is where the majority of the enjoyment from this title has come from for me. Playing with a random person, talking as if we were in the same room and playing pool. It is an incredible sense of presence for me and really makes me feel like this random person is in my room. \nThis is where some caveats come: this is the internet and people are not generally known for demonstrating common sense or respect for anonymous people who they will never see in real life. This can lead to people messing with you, some do it aggressively with spamming beer bottles, smashing lights, or the destruction that is the jukebox.\nThe majority of the people I have met have been cool dudes that are as impressed with the game as I am and just want to play a game of pool.\nI strongly encourage players of this game setting up a real life table to lean against and steady shots on. This helps IMMENSELY (use the arrow keys on the keyboard when you are in game to change the height of the table to match yours). \nIf you have a vive I recommend you give Pool Nation VR a shot. I am terrible at pool in real life (sort of) but with ghost balls (cheating, sue me) it makes the game a lot easier and it allows you to have fun with people a world away. \nLast note: The 'hulk mode' reorientation/locomotion was extremely disorienting and disconcerting for me when I began to play it, this has largely gone away and I have acquired stronger VR legs throughout the games.\nOh ya and HATS.

The more people in multiplayer, the better.\n\nI loaded up the game not expecting much. It's a billiards simulator, how great could it be? Luckily, it was not what I was expecting, as I was smiling pretty much the whole time. The billiards hall is pretty big and you can teleport almost everywhere. The hall itself has more activities than pool, such as darts, dominoes, and breaking bottles. You could also try flirting with some of the ai's, but I guess I wasn't their type, as they just ignored me.\n\nAfter messing around with the various activities scattered about the hall, I decided to dive into the meat of things, the billiards table. Due to haptic feedback, hitting the cue ball feels great and breaking is just as satisfying as in real life. Walking around the table felt so natural! You can teleport to any part of the tale by clicking the edge or, by using your side triggers, you can push and pull your play space. Luckily, my play space is 4mx3m, so once I had the table centered, I could walk all around it without having to worry about my chaperone bounds. This greatly added to my immersion. At one point I actually began to lean on the table while taking a break, but caught myself before I fell. This is the first game that's made me forget I was wearing a headset.\n\nOnce I got comfortable with the table controls, I decided to hop online. It was late here in California, so I wasn't sure if anyone else would be online. I joined an empty room and went back to messing around with bottles and chairs. After a few minutes I hear a noise behind me. \"Hey man, what's up?\" I turn around and there's a pair of floating controllers and a vive headset. I wave at him and he waves back at me. \"Here, have a drink!\" I reply, as I place one of the bottles I had spawned in front of him. We both laugh and start shooting some pool. I talk to him while we play and it turns out he's from New York and just like me, he's been staying up very late ever since getting his Vive. Halfway though the game we start messing around with putting bottles and chairs on the table. It doesn't affect the balls, but the balls will push the furniture around, so it's pretty entertaining to see. At some point I see my opponent wander over to one of the dart board. I follow him and we play a few round of darts, after which we go back to the table and finish our game. I won, we said good game, and with that, he waved and vanished.\n\nThis whole thing was such a great experience. It really feels like your playing with someone in the same room. I can't wait to play some more and get some unlockables. All in all, Pool Nations VR was such an awesome experience. It's definitely a game I'll be adding to my Vive demos when people are over.", "timestamp_created": 1464892579, "timestamp_updated": 1464892579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23348201": {"recommendationid": "23348201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091216137", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498916134}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e Pool Nation VR \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442, \u0441\u0430\u043c\u044b\u043c \u0420\u0415\u0410\u041b\u042c\u041d\u042b\u041c \u0441\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c\u044f\u0440\u0434\u0430, \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0448\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0432\u0438\u0440\u0442\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 HTC Vive!\n\u041f\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c\u044f\u0440\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043b\u0443\u0431\u0435, \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f \u0438\u0437 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430( \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0443 \u0441\u043a\u0435\u043f\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c \u0438 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043b\u044f\u043c, \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438).\n116 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0442\u0437\u044b\u0432\u043e\u0432, \u0438\u0437 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u0445 117. \u041a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c!\n\u0417.\u042b: \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0446\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440, \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043b \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0442, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c Pool Nation VR, \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0435. \u0413\u044b\u044b", "timestamp_created": 1464890373, "timestamp_updated": 1464890373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688011", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23347567": {"recommendationid": "23347567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052888510", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501788668}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome!

It was nice to sidle up to the bar and pretend to order a drink, and throw bottles around. The sound effects from the bar get repeitive, and the AI \"extras\" just repeat the same motions, but they're not meant to be the focus of the game.  I do like that you can wander around the bar and find a few quiet spots, but there's little else to explore.\nI'm 6'1\" tall, and all the AI extras seemed like they were 5'0\".  This, combined with how \"low\" the tables feel, it seems there may be a slight scaling issue.  It would be nice to adjust player height, or be able to adjust vertically with the grip movement.\n\nInterface: The controls were very good and responsive, and once you understand them they feel natural and intuitive.  I am especially a fan of using the grips to move the table around the user - this let me line up shots naturally as I normally would, as well as let me stand in the middle of the table so I didn't have to reach too far into cyberspace that I'd fall over IRL.  The grips felt like using \"wheelchair\" mode, and was by far the best-designed part of the game.\nI was a little disappointed with the \"fine tuning\" aiming helper - it definitely helps line up shots, but seems to have the same sensitivity as normal shots (only it locks one hand).  But this is a minor issue.\n\nGame/Physics:  This is the #1 most important issue for hardcore pool players when evaluating a pool game.  The physics are \"okay\" - it's no Virtual Pool 4.  Cue-english seems to work somewhat, though the table feels slippery, so english doesn't affect it as much as expected.  The pockets on the tables feel very sloppy, at times too tight, at times too wide.  Ball contact angles are pretty solid, so after some mental adjustment you get the feel of how the game wants to be played.\nFor other objects, physics seems janky - beer caps and dice barely bounce at all, while bar chairs will bounce all over the place.  I'm not a dart player, but I felt like I could get to learn the proper throws for darts.\n\nOverall:  If you're into billiards/pool, you'll have a good time.  There are only a few game modes, doesn't seem like you can choose different tables or environments, so it's a pretty limited experience yet.  I haven't had a chance to try MP, but unless networking code is wacked out it should feel similar to playing the AI.  If you're looking for deep career-mode style pool with ladders and locales, it's not here.  If you're not into pool much you may need to pass, because throwing things around a bar at short people who don't respond to you gets old pretty quick.\n\n7/10 - recommended for pool fans", "timestamp_created": 1464883314, "timestamp_updated": 1464883314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562334", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23346294": {"recommendationid": "23346294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105589895", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 1343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495278182}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u633a\u597d\u73a9\u7684\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u8054\u673a\u5bf9\u6253", "timestamp_created": 1464882967, "timestamp_updated": 1464882967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23345212": {"recommendationid": "23345212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013214284", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492178135}, "language": "english", "review": "I played for a short amount of time.

Pool physics are right on!  I do, however have a few suggestions that I think would make the game better:\n\nAbsolutely Needed:\n----------------------------\n1) Implement varying rulesets, or allow customization of the rules (ie: in US 8-ball, non-break fouls result in ball-in-hand only behind the head string, and the target must be on the opposite side of the head string)\n\n2) The \"locking\" system really needs to use both triggers.  The trigger on the bridge hand should lock in the contact point on the cue ball, but leave the grip hand free to adjust the shooting angle without losing your desired contact point on the cue ball.  The trigger on the grip hand should lock in the shooting angle.\n\n\"Nice To Have\"\n-----------------------------\n1) Make the \"dummies\" more reactive to what's going on around them.  Make them duck or yell \"ow\" or something if you throw objects at them.  \n\n2) I haven't checked to see if this exists, but the ability to import your own music or load an internet radio stream into the jukebox would be nice.\n\n3) Darts is kinda weird-feeling, not the fault of the developers, but rather the difference between how you hold a dart vs how you hold the Vive controllers.  Maybe add something else like Air Hockey or Foosball?\n\n4) Implement Cutthroat (a 3-player pool game)", "timestamp_created": 1464873564, "timestamp_updated": 1464873662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23343861": {"recommendationid": "23343861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287183150", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503217819}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u9019\u904a\u6232\u592a\u8b9a\u4e86\uff01\n\u53ef\u4ee5\u6253\u649e\u7403\u3001\u5c04\u98db\u93e2\u3001\u73a9domino, \u9084\u80fd\u7838\u9152\u74f6(?)\n\u63ee\u7aff\u4e5f\u883b\u6709\u611f\u89ba\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1464873183, "timestamp_updated": 1464873183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23343285": {"recommendationid": "23343285", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984108997", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482738835}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best experiences on the VIVE.

I wasn't sure about buying this new game at first, a lot of indie VR games cominng out are gimmicky and just plain crap. When I saw that you could pair up with others online and play I thought it would be fun, I wasn't dissapointed!\n\nThe graphics are really really good, it's not too blurry as a lot of VR games can be with the current generation of hardware. At times it can be difficult to tell if a ball is stripe or solid when it's far away, it's not a big deal to just move your head in a bit closer and have a look. The physics of the pool table are about as good as they can be!\n\nI usually complain about everything but I don't really have much to say here. All I can think of would be a couple of feature additions such as the ability to change the way you look in game, maybe the option to use your own music on the juke box, and maybe to join games as a spectator (just hang out off to the side of a game). It would also be nice if they made it so you couldn't actually move yoruself over the top of the pool table. I don't really see how they could do that so I guess that's why they didn't do it lol.\n\nThe only issue I seem to have found with this game is that the button to put the pool stick away doesn't always seem to work when I tap the button, it's not really a problem but it's something I noticed.

Awesome.\n\nFirstly, the pool game itself is very good. It\u2019s intuitive and slick, and the whole environment looks great. You can also play darts, but I found this to be fairly tricky. I\u2019m sure it could be mastered with a bit of practice though.\n\nBut that\u2019s not where the appeal of this game really lies. It\u2019s an insight into just how social strapping a brick to your head, in a dark room, on your own can actually be. Until now, fun as it may be, VR has been a pretty lonely experience in most games, but Pool Nation VR changes that.\n\nThe multiplayer mode is hilarious. Even though your opponent only appears as goggles and controllers-for-hands, their realistic movements really do give you the sense that you\u2019re actually in the room with someone. Once you have a buddy to share the space with, the pool almost becomes secondary because there are so many other amusing ways to entertain yourselves. Virtually everything in the room can be interacted with, and the physics are pretty spot on.\n\nBearing in mind that it\u2019s this much fun with total strangers, I can\u2019t wait until VR is more commonplace and my mates and I can have virtual get-togethers, presumably on a more regular basis than is feasible to arrange in real life. I\u2019m thinking poker games etc.\n\nIn the games I played against numerous opponents, neither of us spoke much. I put this down to the poor quality of the microphone in the Vive, and the fact that it was late at night and the rest of my family were fast asleep. Instead, all you can hear (aside from the background pub noise and the music) is the pair of you rapidly descending into uncontrollable fits of childish giggles. I could actually see them physically bent over double, as was I! Almost every time I played a shot, I\u2019d look up and see the other guy doing something comical, and vice-versa. I was crying with laughter for most of the time, more so than I\u2019ve done in ages. We tended to use gestures to show, for example, frustration at missing a shot or an outrageous fluke, rather than saying things out loud.\n\nIt was all the more entertaining because this was on the day of release, so you could see that everyone was still figuring it out and were awestruck by the novelty of it all.\n\nTechnically this game excels too. The textures look great, and it\u2019s the only game I\u2019ve seen that manages to make the resolution of the screens look several times greater than they actually are and as they appears in other titles.\n\nMy only complaints thus far are:\n\n\u2022\tI\u2019d like to be able to adjust the position of my grip hand on the butt of the cue. The reason being is because, by default, it\u2019s quite far forwards and I can see no way of changing it. This means you\u2019re hitting your body with the controller as you stroke the cue back and forth. In real life my hand would be further behind me.\n\u2022\tSidespin doesn\u2019t seem to take any affect when the ball bounces off a cushion, and I can\u2019t appear to get the ball to swerve. Maybe I just need more practice.\n-       The background sounds are on a loop of a few minutes, and every so often you hear some bloke banging on about 'Tuesday night, Tuesday night'. If it weren't for him you probably wouldn't notice it looping. It just breaks the immersion slightly.\n\nSome suggestions and wishes:\n\n\u2022\tMultiple players (as in more than two), and/or spectators. It would just add to the atmosphere and hilarity. You\u2019d probably need to be able to set up an exclusion zone around your table though to stop dickheads trying to ruin your games. Either that or a vote-to-kick or some sort of block system.\n\u2022\tAccess to your own music library. It would be cool if it could be displayed and selected using the jukebox in the room. I could create a playlist and then anyone could choose songs from it to queue up.\n\u2022\tI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a technical term for this, but it makes things so much more realistic when objects resist each other. E.g. at Present, I can grab a bottle and wave it through other objects. In Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades, for example, the physics are just a little better in this way.\n\u2022\tFollowing on from the point above, I shouldn\u2019t be able to play a shot where my cue is intersecting another object \u2013 a ball in front or the cushion of the table etc.\n\u2022\tWhen positioning your head within a solid object, such as a wall or the pool table, the sound and vision should go blurry, like in Call of the Starseed.\n\u2022\tBe able to write messages \u2013 maybe on a board so you can hold it up to the intended recipient (assuming more participants are allowed in later releases). Could either type text or scrawl it with chalk or the like. Maybe have a set of predefined sentences and/or be able to define your own (\u2018good shot\u2019, \u2018you fluky twat\u2019 etc.). This goes back to what I was saying earlier about not being able to talk if the rest of your household are asleep or whatever.\n\u2022\tBeer to flow from the bottles and bar taps.\n-       Mirrors on the wall so you can see yourself also.\n\u2022\tChange the TV channels, or even play music videos from your library.\n\u2022\tMore environments.\n\u2022\tBe able to create and share new environments, tables, people, cues etc.\n\u2022\tBe able to create, style and position bystander avatars.\n\u2022\tBe able to control lighting levels etc.\n\u2022\tBe able to control ambient noise and music levels.\n\u2022\tHave a full head visible instead of just the VR goggles and hats. Could even have facial expressions to select from. Could be amusing.\n\u2022\tHands visible in the game instead of controllers? You could then have hand gestures like in Hover Junkers.\n\u2022\tMiscues if you hit the ball at an acute angle and/or haven\u2019t chalked your cue (need to be able to chalk the cue!).\n\u2022\tMore game types/rules. English pub rules. Red and yellow. Two shots upon fouling etc. Display the rules somewhere.\n\u2022\tSnooker option.\n\u2022\tReplays. Slow-motion etc.\n\u2022\tPocket tightness adjustment.\n\u2022\tTable speed adjustment.\n\u2022\tThe potted balls to show up in the clear slot on the side of the table like in real life.\n\u2022\tRoom scale and height adjuster.\n\u2022\tAdjust the scale of the people in the room. Everyone seems a bit small, which is fine for the girls, but the guys look a tad out of proportion.\n\u2022\tThe bystanders to walk around instead of just dancing and chatting on the spot.\n\u2022\tBe able to punch the guys and undress the girls. There, I said it. Everyone was thinking it!\n\nTip: You can actually grab the three big lights above the pool table and take it with you to illuminate the sweet, peachy asses of the chicks around the room. You\u2019re welcome. Update: They just fixed that bug. It was fun while it lasted. Maybe they could put a torch in the room instead??\n\nUntil now, Audioshield was my favourite (followed by Project Cars), but Pool Nation VR now easily takes that crown by a loooong way.\n\nI already had high hopes/expectations for the future potential of VR hardware and apps, but this definitely raises the bar and whets the appetite further.

Graphics are great. Controls are great. Presence is great. There's a good teleportation system--I was able to play just fine with about 4 square meters of space.\n\nYou can move the whole room around to get a good angle, and it's not very nausea-inducing if you look at the table while doing it. There's a grid that appears around you while moving the room, which stays stationary and keeps you feeling anchored in space.\n\nIt's a bit weird to line up your shot when you can't rest your hand on the table, but you can lock it in place so you don\\'t have to worry about holding it still while you follow through.\n\nIt felt more natural than any computer pool game I've ever played. I even found it easier to line up my shots when the \"ghost ball\" aiming aid was turned off.\n\n[after 90 minutes]\nStill really impressed. The resolution of the Vive is a noticeable limitation on long shots. I ended up using the back of a recliner as stand-in for the table itself. With a steady bridge hand I started making shots much more often.\n\nThe atmosphere is tuned really well. There's movement and noise around you enough to make you feel like you're in a bar. I would say it's like a pool hall, but the only pool noises are the ones at your table. But the atmosphere is never so loud or animated that it distracts you.

I played throughout the Beta of this game and the devs made constant tweaks and updates during it\\'s development which is a really positive sign. \n\nIn the last update they enabled proper spin/english on the cue ball so it follows natural paths off cushions along with an easy to use height adjustment hotkey. This enables players to use a real life table to lean on when taking shots just like real pool, this increases emmersion and comfort during play. There is an option to use a ghost ball if you just want to play casually but I prefer the realistic feel of playing snooker/pool at home with the guides and aids turned off.\n\nThis game is multiplayer online and I would say this is probably one of the very best experiences currently available for virtual reality so far. I have made some videos on YouTube and recently included a brief review of this last update, just search Falandorn on YouTube and click my uploaded videos.\n\nWith all the current options it is just impossible not to love this game and they are looking to keep developing it in future too.

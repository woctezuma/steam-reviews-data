Besides the pun, it's an imaginative game that is designed for couch co-op with up to 4 players. It's got a loveably charming visual style, great music and mostly fun setpieces. But in my opinion, it is flawed. The first 2 worlds are fun, fast-paced and chaotic even with only 1 other player. The 3rd world starts to become slow, tedious and meandering. Lots of enemies you can't kill, or even can't hit unless you bring them close to a sun. \n\nThe 3rd world boss uses all these new, frustrating mechanics and throws them at you while you TRY to hit him within a very short timeframe while also trying to dodge a bunch of stuff. This is super frustrating when you only have 2 people and you want to be moving the ship to have a good angle to line up shots, you want to then shoot him in the short vulnerability frames, while also using the shield to deflect the 2 or 3 cardinal directions from which the sun, icicles, his legs and body are all coming at you from. With 4 people I could see this being a breeze because you can cover most ground while also taking advantage and doing the most amount of damage after making the boss vulnerable. With 2 people there's about 5 seconds for every minute where you get to do anything other than fly around and dodge. You're also waiting for him to throw out a sun this whole time because otherwise you literally can't do anything to him.\n\nAnyway, that's so far the worst part of the game and it's one that only seems relevant with 1 or 2 players. Everything before that ranges from enjoyable to amazing. If all you want to do is play a pleasant co-op experience with a friend or partner... I think there's better games out there. If you have 3 other people then you will probably love this wholeheartedly throughout Lovers runtime. Me? I liked it. It's good but imperfect.

Do you hate that Person?[/b]\n\nBut seriously, Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, aside from being a fun name to say, is an odd game. I would recommend it but with one or two caveats. The big one, like, really big, is that you should probably have some friends to play it with. There is single player, and it is pretty fun, but frankly I'm not sure the single player alone is worth $15. If you have friends you can play this with regularly (I must point out it's local only) it is a riot.

I recommend it for people who actually have irl friends. Seems to be a rare commodity these days. Have you guys ever wondered why that is? I have a theory that because we are always so connected (i.e. social media, text messaging and (((snapchat))) that there is not that 'oh how have you been' type of feeling.

I can assure you, you will not get bored with this game.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Ship upgrades: throughout the levels, you can find 3 different types of gems (power, laser, metal) which modify the behaviors of your ships modules. Letting you customize your ship to match your playstyle, or the level you're playing on.\n\n- Multiple Ships: once you get far enough more ships become available to you. some of them have a very different playstyle then the default ship.\n\n- Bonus Objectives: to complet a level, you only need to gather 5 of the 10 friends that are trapped on the map. You must take the decision to risk your ship and save all your friends or take the safer route and go to the exit right away.\n\n- Coop not optional: This game requires you to communicate and be on the same page as your teamates otherwise you won't get far.\n\nCONS:\n\n- No online Coop: A shame, but not that big of a con. Don't buy this game if you don't have any friends.\n\n- Swaping module upgrades can be tricky: Later in the game you have the ability to have 2 upgrade slots on your modules. It happened to us more then once during our session that we want to swap out an upgrade but instead it will replace the upgrade you don't want to replace. Be very carful of where you're standing when swapping out a Gem.\n\nWould You Recommend?\n\nYes, definitely buy this game if you have a couch and a couple friends to play with, It's tons of fun.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1504331859, "timestamp_updated": 1504331859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34617169": {"recommendationid": "34617169", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057481874", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510480258}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego para esas juntas de amigos donde lo unico que importa es divertirse.\nNo solo eso, puede llegar a ser realmente un reto si se quiere con la dificultad dificil, en caso de que tu y tus amigos quieran no solo divertirse y busquen algo mas como un desaf\u00edo.\nEl unico punto debil es que si estas jugando solo, de verdad se puede volver muy tedioso y aburrido pero eso no le quita su potencial como un gran juego", "timestamp_created": 1504123759, "timestamp_updated": 1504123759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34537179": {"recommendationid": "34537179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352974359", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514337751}, "language": "english", "review": "What a great couch game.

Divers\u00e3o, risadas e irrita\u00e7\u00e3o foi a trindade que se manifestou durante minha experi\u00eancia com esse jogo. Ainda na campanha da \"Ursa Maior\", minha dupla disse, sempre delicada: \"porque voc\u00ea n\u00e3o levanta sua bunda do controle do escudo e n\u00e3o atira na ala leste ent\u00e3o?\" Ah, o amor.\nNunca vi um jogo que merecesse tanto o termo de coop na minha biblioteca: se voc\u00ea e sua dupla n\u00e3o cooperarem, provavelmente v\u00e3o se divertir por muito pouco tempo. Esse bullet hell (com um jeitinho de arcade survival) precisa de movimentos coordenados e uma equipe extremamente engajada, porque qualquer movimento desengon\u00e7ado \u00e9 punido severamente pelo jogo. \n__\n\nO objetivo desse jogo \u00e9 manter sua nave operante enquanto busca um n\u00famero X de tripulantes-coelho que conseguem abrir o buraco de minhoca (ou um port\u00e3o-cora\u00e7\u00e3o gigante) para a outra fase. H\u00e1 sempre o dobro da tripula\u00e7\u00e3o necess\u00e1ria para abrir o buraco em cada fase, e capturar mais tripula\u00e7\u00f5es do que o necess\u00e1rio te bonifica com cristais que te ajudam a aprimorar a nave. O jogo tem uma progress\u00e3o bem planejada, e cabe a voc\u00eas dois utilizarem os cristais para aprimorar de forma eficiente sua nave. \u00c9 um jogo fren\u00e9tico, e voc\u00ea normalmente vai perder de vista seu personagem por estar vendo a movimenta\u00e7\u00f5es dos inimigos fora da sua nave. Bel\u00edssimo, roda a 60FPS tranquilamente (dependendo da m\u00e1quina que estiver usando), e o jogo n\u00e3o apresenta qualquer queda de FPS, mesmo com sua beleza c\u00f3smica estonteante e uma tela repleta de inimigos atirando em sua nave-chiclete. A trilha sonora vai de m\u00fasica lofi \u00e0 future house, todas muito bem escolhidas e que se encaixam muito bem no ambiente e no tempo do jogo. \nTudo envolto em uma palheta de cores que causaria epilepsia no Jap\u00e3o dos anos 2000.\n\nA proposta do jogo \u00e9 nos levar a um gameplay coop local, ent\u00e3o nada de suporte para o online (at\u00e9 agora, 10/07/17), mas a ultima atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o considerou aumentar o tamanho dos operantes, e agora o jogo tem suporte para at\u00e9 4 jogadores.\n\n\nDe longe, um coop fant\u00e1stico, recomendo fortemente a compra desse jogo caso tenha um companheiro de jogos.

Best with four people, though.\nThis game is wonderful. Simple, yet will keep you and a few local friends very entertained. \nPlaying this game by yourself is just not anywhere near as fun and is actually quite stressful. So try to only play when you have a few friends over and you have multiple controllers hooked up to your computer. If you meet those standards, prepare to have a great time. \nI can't say there is a lot of content in this game, but it's not expensive and when you can only play with friends, you probably won't beat this too fast. Also, by the time you beat the game, you will not be bored of it.

It almost ended our relationship but we are stronger now having destroyed hundreds of monsters together.\n\nIt gets much easier the more people you have playing as 2 players makes it quite hard to balance shooting, moving and shields but it is definitely doable. A lot of customization for weapons, engines and shields as you have several color gems to mix and match in these stations giving you a decent amount of combinations to work with. Some combos give you turbo boost for your engine where as other combos let you leave mines behind you as you move. Each story chapter has a different theme or challenege to overcome, preparing you for the end game where they throw everything at you.\n\nOverall this is a great couch shooter to play with the

I thought it'd be nice, and I always dreamed of having a gamer girlfriend. If she wasn't one, then I must simply convert her.\n\nIt was tough, and we've ran into many bad games trying to find our feet. Sure, you can google or youtube \"best co op games to play with your significant other\" but really, at the end of the day, it's trial and error. You just gotta buy, try, and see if it works. \n\nThis game is not like that. This game, I bet you my house, will steal your girl. If you're trying to convert your girlfriend to video games, trust me, start with this game.\n\nIt's hard, but not so hard it'll frustrate a newb. It has perfect balance between co op and skill. What this means is that, both of you to some extent need to know what you're doing, and contribute to the task at hand (running away from the monsters, shooting the baddies, etc) but the more experienced gamer can still carry the team without making the others look useless. It's so much fun. You can calculate EVERY MOVE, but once it gets hectic, it's utter chaos. Incredibly good fun. \n\n97.5/100\n\nPS follow \"Convert Your Significant Other!\" or CoYoSiOt, my Steam Curator page, if you're interested in finding good games with an emphasis on cooperative play and accessibility to convert your significant other! Does your loved one complain about your gaming habits? Says you spend too much time and money on steam? Worry not! Follow my page and I guarantee you'll both be spending twice as much time and money on gaming than ever before! Everybody wins!

Don't be fooled! This world of love is hard to beat, and you and you're friend are going to really need to strategize and coordinate to win.\n\nThe game feels a lot like a bullet hell where all your controls have been made more awesome (but more complicated) by attaching them all to parts of a spaceship. You can play single player and have an ai partner that you can give directions to, but the game is designed for two player local coop. One person can control the engine, the map, the shield, or one of the four guns and at any one moment you will probably want to be using at least 3 of these things at once. However only two players can play at a time so you end up with these situations of \"what can i stop using and still be alive\" which i found really fun to try and explain to my sister who i played with. On top of that, the upgrade system to your ship starts off simple, but it has a lot to explore once you start collecting bunnies. The levels are really big, almost too big in my opinion but luckily a good chunk of every level is optional and you're free to explore it however you like. Highly recommend this game for you space exploring needs.\n\nA technical note: full controller support is nice, but i found the keyboard default bindings to be really confusing and akward for two players. Luckily there are keybindings, but it feels weird that the game defaults to a state expecting a controller. Also slightly dissapointed we can't have a four man party but also i understand the limitations of this sort of game and appreciate it being as fun as it is.", "timestamp_created": 1493697990, "timestamp_updated": 1493697990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513955", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31499550": {"recommendationid": "31499550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059612408", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514000538}, "language": "english", "review": "Although I've had some controller issues with cheap SNES knock-offs, this game can only be described as RAD!

But first things first, quick buyers' guide. This game is intended for players with multiple controller and multiple gamer friend. To have the optimal experience you need 3 other player and a total of 4 game controller. Be warned, your frustration will increase the further you are from the ideal setup.\n\nBreakdown:\n\nGraphics: 2D doesn't mean it can't have any depth. I've seen 2D games like \"the way\" having beautifully drawn, detailed background that far surpass the graphics in this game. While the graphics in this game is acceptable, it only passes by the mediocre standard of the average fastfood industry mindset of our average consumer.\n\nsoundtrack: Again, just enough to fill the silence but probably not gonna put it in my playlist anytime soon. On the other hand, the taste in music quite often differs from person from person so I'll leave it at that.\n\ngame mechanics: Heres where I felt the game failed the most. First off, the game is intended to be played with a controller, which is not part of an average PC setup. On top of that, this game only have local multiplayer. To further add to the problem, on single player mode you start with only one AI partner, which does a mediocre job at assisting you. As a result, you constantly have to sprint from station to station (like between the ship control to gun control) and to put a cherry on the top enemy also spawn continuously. If this game gives you more AI partner, or allows you to move and fire at the same time in single player or spawn well less enemy or allows the player to scroll out to see a bigger area or do just about anything else. Then this game wouldn't be as bad as it is. But the sad reality is, this game is intended for console, this game is intended for multiplayer. And then the developers throw in a single player mode as an after thought. Which of course failed miserably.\n\nIn summary, based on the frustrating game mechanics and average graphics and soundtrack. I'm scoring this game 6/10. On the other hand, if you happend to have a lot of gamer friends handy then I'd highly recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1487732150, "timestamp_updated": 1487732150, "voted_up": false,

1495575703}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is one of the best hidden gems on steam. It's a game about flying a spaceship and rescuing space critters, with every player manning a different station. For example, someone might be stearing, while another is on shields, and another on a turret. It's such a cool concept, and it's executed phenomenally well. Switching between stations is fast and easy, and all of the controls are simple and intuitive.\n\n The three difficulties encompass pretty much every playstyle there is; with easy being almost impossible to die in, normal being challenging but fair, and hard/veteran being hard enough that you're almost guaranteed to die a few times. \n\nThe music in this game is incredible. This game would have been perfectly fine if there was some generic, relaxing \"space\" music in the background, but they decided to do more than that. Some of the tracks are reminiscent of Hotline Miami. Almost kind of odd considering how cutsy this game is, but it works and sounds great (look up \"ost Crystal C\"). And the boss themes are intense and get the heart pounding (my favourite is \"Orion\"). \n\nThe graphics are beautiful to look at and everything animates extremely smooth. It can be eye candy in some parts. I should also mention that while this game is meant to be played with a friend or significant other, it's still fun to play the game by yourself. If played solo, you get an npc that you can tell to man different stations. The AI is good enough that you never get frustrated with it; it's honestly better than most real people I've played this with. \n\nIn conclusion, this game is well worth the $15 asking price, and a steal when it goes on sale. So do yourself a favor and pick this up. You won't regret it!

I had a Couch Co-op session with a buddy yesterday and it was amazing, we failed a few times but it was hours of crazy fun. \n\nConsidering I only have about 4-5 hours in..\nThe Music is entertaining and varies on each level so far.\nThe Action is well paced and it's really fun to split up responsibilities thru team-work.\nI do think the game is better thru a Co-op experience, kinda sad there's no online experience but a mic would be essential at that point to be on par with local co-op, it does require coordination.\nThe Game offers a good replay value with the different upgrade combinations you can apply to your ship, different configs bring different play-styles and I love the originality of that mechanic.\n\nIt has a Millenium Falcon feel, a Chewy and Han Solo duo working together thru their adventure.\n\nIf you enjoy Couch Co-op games, like light techno music and the kind of art-style you see here.. this is a MUST for you !!

The controls are so simple that your one-joystick-at-a-time friends can play easily. The game plays exactly how it should. No weird bugs, glitches, or missing/improper gameplay mechanics to be found. This is especially true in terms of the upgrade system. Upgrading different parts of your ship is awesome! Every single time my friends and I installed a new upgrade or new upgrade combo and then tested it for the first time, all of our reactions were \"OOOOOHHHHH!!!!!\" in sync.

In a nutshell, Lovers is a space action game where 1-4 players share the task of running a small spaceship. Your tiny characters run and jump from room to room to man weapon turrets, direct shields, activate special weapons and pilot your space jalopy. If you've played FTL, that will give you a rough idea of how the ship is layed out. As you thrust around the 2D enviorments dodging space rocks and blasting a menagerie of baddies your main goal is to rescue imprisoned space bunnies who annoyingly scream when you get near them. Once you've located and freed enough of them the exit will open and you can blast your way to the next level. \n\nIt's a simple formula that stays fresh for a few reasons: Firstly, each module on your ship can be augmented with a gem that changes it's function. For instance a metal gem, turns your gun turret into a tethered spike ball that you launch at enemies and retract. A beam gem placed in your shield generator allows you to deflect enemy projectiles back at them, etc. With upgrades you can add 2 gems to each module for even more varied abilities. Secondly, the enviorments in each level provide just enough in new obstacles to keep from getting stale. A water level might have a rushing current that carries you around a level while sinister pods sticking to the walls will burst unleashing a group of small enemies upon you if you get to close. Lastly, the games core gameplay co-op spaceship action, is simple, fun, frantic and challenging enough that it will keep you and your friends engaged for a long time.\n\nOn the minus side, playing with 3-4 people is the ideal number and any less can become frustrating as you will constantly need to run all over your ship. With only 1 or 2 people this means one of your important ship systems will be unmanned, leaving you vulnerable in one way or another in dire situations. For instance, there are several cases where enemies will frantically swarm you and the best course of action is to jet away while your buddies shield to fend them off and blast a trail for you with a weapon turret. With out the manpower to cover all your systems it can be very difficult to survive in these situations. In single player you are given a competent AI partner and you have the option of lowering the difficulty, but the problem still persists. And to compound this problem is the glaring omission of online play. While playing Lovers with a room of friends is a great experience that we don't get enough of these days, the convenience of online play should not have been ignored and would still provide a great co-op experience.\n\nDespite these issues. Lovers manages to provide a unique, charming and visually striking space adventure like no other. As a single player experience it's still an enjoyable game.

You have a sphere spacehsip which has a number of different modules including turrets, shields, driving, and so fourth. You can only command 1 of these modules at a time, so you quickly have to move between each one in order to defend different sides of the ship.\n+ Visually the game looks great with bright neon colors and very clean yet detailed graphics. The particle effects, bullets, and so fourth also look fantastic.\n+ Cute lovable story about Love and Anti-Love with very cute animal characters and lots of hearts.\n+ Many weapon combinations created through \"gems\" which you can combine to create new and creative weapons.\n+ The boss fights are pretty epic in scale, are a load of fun, and can be quite challenging at times\n+ 1-4 Co-Op, if you have 4 players to play this game with you, you will have an absolute BLAST although the game is perfectly playable solo as you are given an AI companion.\n+ Amazing soundtrack\n\n- Your AI companion can be a little \"dumb\" at times.

It would be nice to play some local co-op games before I leave, and Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime had given us a enjoyable experience.\n\nThe first time we launched the game it was from my brother's Steam account, so we stopped halfway through the first cutscene to change to my account, which owns the game, just so I can get some trading cards and achievements.\n\nBoth times we watched to first cutscene, my bother would always tell me that I'm gay. Maybe because it's called \"Lovers\" in a Dangerous Spacetime, but I had figured it was fine to play with my brother. \n\nThe first boss we came across taught us that the game would be a ton more challenging that it seeemed. We had died an enless amount of times to that boss, because we lacked coordination. My brother, a true lover of the Souls franchise (I am one too), complained that the bosses were way too hard, and \"I'd rather finish our Kirito and Asuna builds in Dark Souls 2.\" But I convinced him to keep trying, well, more like I forced him to.\n\nBy the time we defeated the second boss, which was suprisingly easy, our coordination had improved signifigantly. We would man the turrents, the shields, and drive at the same time. Still, we often found ourselves rushing to the love portal at the end of the level with the tiniest skimp of health.\n\nIn summary, the game has you and your friends working together in different roles to defeat the antilove monsters, and though this shared experience will reinforce relationships as well as build new ones. Of course, it is frustratingly dificult, but that just means you and your friends will feel more acomplished when you win. Don't be fooled by the title of the game, play it with your guy friends or gal friends. Heck, why not all of your friends in 4-player co-op? (assuming you only have four friends, which I totally feel ya). Very fun and frustrating local co-op. 8.5/10\n\nOh, and by the way, we did play this on two player co-op normal mode.\n\n\"Just restart the level until we get the last metal gem we need to wreck the boss with our rocket launchers!

When I found out it's finally coming out I couldn't wait. I bought it on release without thinking.\nOh man, did this game DELIVER.\nI love coop games and this is pretty much the pinnacle of what I've seen. It is currently my No. 1 favourite coop game of all time. It dethroned Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light and that's quite an achivement in my book.\nMost games have tacked-on coop modes that many times just don't work. This a true coop experience and everything is built around it. You can play solo but it's rather boring since you'll be flying the ship 90% of the time while an AI partner will do most of the more interesting stuff (like shooting !). I also didn't play 3 or 4-player coop so I can't tell how good that is. The core 2 player experience is insane though.\nThe game is so action packed you'll forget you had real-life stuff to do. Every level is a constant scramble to man the necessary stations. It's almost like there's not enough people on your ship, but that's what makes it so fun to pull off. You need to fly the ship, angle the shields and shoot 4 guns all at the same time and enemies just keep on coming.\nThere's a surprising amount of variation on subsystem upgrades (guns, shields etc.) and you can tweak your ship to fit your playstyle.\nLevels are semi-randomized. You get the same opponents and similar obstacles but the layout changes. It's not the level of some other games but enough to keep the levels from becoming a chore to repeat if you fail.\nEach campaing has a different theme and ends in a pretty cool and challenging boss fight. Each level also has a different twist on the theme.\nThere's 3 different ships (2 unlock later) plus the one you start with gets a few upgrated versions later on. One of the other ships is kind of weird and not everybody will be able to play it though. I don't wanna spoil here but is a little mind bending. Makes some people dizzy. I'd kind of like some more ships but it's not that big of a deal.\n\nIt is local coop only and many people complain about it. It's understandable and a valid point but I would like to add that I feel like this game would not be that fun if you weren't sitting next to your partner. Online coop is great - but it's not the same.\nSo if you have somebody to play with I'd HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying this.

F\u00fcr Couch Party Fans ist es eines der wenigen Games auf Steam, die man kooperativ spielt und ein Muss! Doch worum geht's? Bis zu vier Spieler steuern kooperativ ein Raumschiff, dabei \u00fcbernimmt jeder ein Subsystem - z.B. Steuerung, Schilde oder eines der Waffensysteme. Habe es gestern auf der SteamMachine mit einem Freund gezockt, wo es problemlos unter SteamOS lief. Heute nochmal die erste Mission im Single Player gespielt unter Windows. Spielt man allein, bekommt man ein Pet, dass der Computer \u00fcbernimmt. Diesem kann man dann ein System zuweisen. Aber allein w\u00fcrde ich es nicht empfehlen - so richtig bocken tut es mit mehreren auf der Couch! Ohne zu wissen, wie umfangreich es wirklich ist, vermute ich langen Spielspa\u00df, denn man kann noch einige Raumschiffe freischalten und die Systeme derer auch noch upgraden.

So much, that the game is infinitely more rewarding with more friends to play. By that token, buys beware: it is highly recommended you bring additional passengers for this ride!\n\nGreat presentation and audio make this an endearing package, with gameplay that is simple to understand, but hard to master as the levels progress. It is evident that an enormous amount of effort was invested into LiaDS, a sediment which is echoed by excellent aethestics, difficulty progression, and engaging gameplay.\n\nA few gripes do not escape this game from a hearty recommendation. Gamers who are wishing for a forgiving game will be marginally dissapointed, as after a couple hours of gameplay, the level of challenge ramps up significantly. Game levels become long, and trecherous. A misfired cannon, or an unmanned engine can potentionally lead to demise; a loss of 20-30 minutes of gameplay to restart the level.\n\nBy inverse, the game is rewarding. If you can progress in the game with enough skill and determination, you are rewarded with more gadgets and enemys to test the might of your friends and yourself. \n\nIf you are interested in a well-constructed, engaging, and fun local multiplayer game, look no further.

Frankly, this hearkens back to those couch gaming days with games that test you and your partner through fun, though admittedly difficult at times, game play.  \nNow, for some reason Steam does not show how much time i have actually spent in this game, so do not let that be a bias.  That's a Steam problem, not the game's nor my own.\n\nGame play: Almost solely Co-op.  Requiring much focus, multitasking, and cooperation between players.  COOPERATION IS KEY!  I would not try to play this alone (unless you have multiple controllers and arms) because, while there is AI, it can at times seem overpowered or under-powered as any AI tends to be.  However, the AI companion is either a cat or dog, so there is a slight aesthetic advantage. That said, once you do get used to the game play, it becomes super fun.\n\nVisuals and sound: simply cute and epic, as you can plainly see from the game art.  Bright, colorful, and loud.  The game is stimulating, and just the style makes the game worth playing as it keeps you engrossed in a cute/simple yet somehow simultaneously epic and destructive environment.\n\nControls: So many would suggest purchasing and programming multiple game controllers/pads, it is personally up to preference.  I remember huddling around one keyboard with friends to play co-op games on PC long ago, and got personally attached to that \u2013 not necessarily couch gaming, as you/your friends huddle around a tiny space.  Keyboard gaming really made my friends and I close.  But again, personal preference: keyboard or controller(s).\n\nStory: You (and your buddy) are super cute heroes/creatures tasked with finding pieces of the Ardor Reactor \u2013 a machine that harnesses and spreads the power of love; broken by the \u201cAnti-Love\u201d.  Along the way, of course, you shoot  enemies, fly around, explore, save bunnies, and everything else you would expect from super cute space travel with love as its goal.\n\nLength: This game can be played for hours on end, but is more casual and in reality short.  \n\nFinal Thoughts: Think C's for this game.  This game is a cute and casual co-op, calling back to couch-gaming.  Controller(s) recommended but not necessary... Oh yeah, and...

Seriously this made my last day home for awhile a lot of fun. But anyway to my actual review score.\n\nI gotta give this game a 9/10. The only thing keeping it from 10/10 for me is lack of online multiplayer, and singleplayer just doesn't come close to how much fun this is with a friend.

I actually got to preview this at PAX Prime earlier this year and it was one of the most popular titles in the indie area and with good reason. Lovers is a cooperative space exploration game where two players must cooperate to man various stations on a spaceship to navigate through space and rescue little space critters. In order to complete a level, a certain number of little space critters has to be rescued for the exit to be unlocked but if you and your partner are feeling like completionists, you can collect all of the critters in each stage to get access to different model ships and unlock other powerups faster. The locations of the critters and the entire world as a whole are totally differently systematically generated on each run, giving every playthrough a fresh feel. Once you find a critter, usually some small challenge has to be completed before you can rescue them. For example, you may have to fight several waves of enemies, escape an explosion or fight a mini boss. \n\nThere are various stations to man on each ship including weapons, shields, engines and a powerful yamato cannon weapon. There are several campaigns that are made up of 4 levels and a final boss fight. Each level offers upgrade crystals that you can install in your systems that will persist throughout the campaign. Deciding which crystals to place in which systems is initially a fun experimental learning process, but I've found once you know what the crystal combinations do, you usually fall into a pattern of upgrading that results in a familiar ship layout each time. But there are also several ship layouts to unlock in the game, each with their own stats and quirky gameplay rules. For instance, there's one unlockable ship that constantly rotates around while you play, making locating and controlling your character within the ship quite a challenge, but as a tradeoff, the ship is also immune to terrain damage. I'm a sucker for these kinds of unlockable gameplay variations and this game reminded me a bit of my favorite FTL from the space exploration and battles right down to the unlockable ships. Obviously the gameplay is nowhere close to the same, but there are similarities to be drawn between the two roguelike space exploration games\n\nThere are only two crew members, making coordination and teamwork a key to success in this game. Communication with your partner is necessary and coming up with a good strategy is vital so that you and your teammate aren't running to the same stations to man the same systems. Once you get that strategy established and you and your partner know how to run the ship like seasoned space travelers, it's a really neat feeling. But it's also just as fun to yell and scream at your partner when things are going horribly wrong and your ship is about to explode\n\nLovers in a Dangerous Spacetime offers the best experiences for couch co-op play. It's conceptually simple to learn and easy to pick up and play. But there's still a decent amount of strategy, skill and depth to be found here as well, and applying these strategies skill and depth of understanding of the game is especially necessary in the later levels where the difficulty gets ratcheted up quite a bit. I really enjoyed this game; it's one of the best couch cooperative experiences I've had.

There's a tutorial level that is almost a little bit too long and slow, but effectively gives you the basics.  Once you're fully kitted out, the world is yours to explore, and the game doesn't explain anything to you any longer.  What's neat is that it *doesn't have to*.  The game mechanics are easily discoverable and are almost always a delightful surprise instead of an annoying interruption.\n\nThe graphics are bright and attractive.  The music is perfect.  The controls are the perfect mix of smooth and frustrating.  \nThe weapons are nicely balanced so that they never really feel overpowered, never get difficult to use, but still can reward players for their skill.\n\nNow the bad, because there IS bad, I'm afraid:  The game is probably easiest to play with gamepads.  However, in the version shipping when I wrote this, there's some terrible defaults configured, and dual gamepads won't work right.  Gamepad + Keyboard won't work right.  In general, nothing's going to work right with two players right out of the box.  But, if you know that, and are prepared to remap all the controls manually, your patience will be rewarded.\n\nOh, by the way: The game does have a single-player mode... but you shouldn't really bother with it.

Historias sencillas pero que llevan la pasi\u00f3n en cada l\u00ednea de c\u00f3digo. \u201cLovers in a Dangerous Spacetime\u201d es uno de esos juegos. El espacio es un lugar realmente peligroso, especialmente cuando el caos se desata ante la p\u00e9rdida de las cuatro piezas del Reactor de Ardor. \u00a1De Ardor amoroso!\n\nLo que hacemos por amor\u2026\nEsta terrible p\u00e9rdida ha tenido sus consecuencias, y es que hay muchos amiguitos entre constelaciones a rescatar. La fuerza del amor por rescatarles y la gratitud por tal haza\u00f1a te insuflan las fuerzas necesarias para avanzar.\n\n\u00a1Sois h\u00e9roes! La galaxia est\u00e1 en tus manos para salvarla. As\u00ed que mirad con confianza a vuestro compa\u00f1ero y subid a la nave Chicle. Y s\u00ed, es de color rosa chicle. No pasar\u00e1 desapercibida entre el escenario, pero es que los h\u00e9roes van pisando fuerte. Si decides jugar solo, el futuro te provee de dos criaturas, gato y perro a elegir, modificados gen\u00e9ticamente para que sean tus mejores aliados. Has de avanzar entre campa\u00f1as que son cuatro constelaciones en total, con cuatro niveles en cada una sumado al quinto que ser\u00e1 el jefe.\n\n\u00bfPreparados para embarcar?\nTienes a tu compa\u00f1ero que te dar\u00e1 fuerza en la aventura y una nave. Toca surcar el espacio en dos dimensiones en el que debemos tener una gran percepci\u00f3n del espacio, controlar el mapa, mantener la atenci\u00f3n, conocer tus armas y lo que no son armas, dominar el estr\u00e9s\u2026\n\nEs un juego realmente completo, muchas cosas que tener en cuenta. A medida que juegas compruebas que es un avance lento, de \u00e9xito incremental que resulta realmente satisfactorio, pero de ritmo fren\u00e9tico. No es posible aburrirse.\n\nEntre esos factores has de tener en cuenta: las posibles colisiones, las \u00f3rbitas de algunos cuerpos celestes pues cambiar\u00e1n tus movimientos, las conductas de los enemigos que has de aprender, c\u00f3mo el entorno es tu aliado en ocasiones, un amplio mapa a explorar, la salud de tu nave pues no has de malgastar los bonos de salud que encontrar\u00e1s la misma estructura de la nave que has de conocer a base de moverte.\n\nTambi\u00e9n encontrar\u00e1s varios puestos de control: cuatro ca\u00f1ones, un ca\u00f1\u00f3n especial, un visualizador del mapa en su plenitud y por supuesto, el tim\u00f3n. A medida que rescates a (cinco como m\u00ednimo) amiguitos a la deriva, criaturillas que cambian dependiendo de la campa\u00f1a que juegues, te abrir\u00e1n portales a las fases siguientes. Adem\u00e1s de escalar para subir tu rango y as\u00ed desbloquear ventajas para tu nave. \u00bfAlgunas de esas ventajas? Una curiosa nave adicional y muescas en las que puedes a\u00f1adir turbos para los diferentes puestos de control, \u00a1y fant\u00e1sticas combinaciones!\n\nEntrar en la aventura de Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime requiere concentraci\u00f3n, y sin duda la banda sonora favorece a ello. Especialmente \u00fatil a la hora de enfrentarse a los jefes, cuya estrategia vas asimilando a medida que avanzas en la campa\u00f1a.\n\nSi juegas solo, has de enfrentarte a un reto adicional. Aunque tengas a tu lado al mejor amigo del hombre, ya sea en forma gatuna o perruna, su inteligencia artificial es limitada. Obedece tus \u00f3rdenes y es pr\u00e1cticamente un maestro armero, \u00a1pero no se puede tener todo! Hay ventajas que sacar del escenario que has de descubrir con tu ingenio, adem\u00e1s de tu necesidad de estar pendiente de hacia d\u00f3nde se mueve tu compa\u00f1ero para ayudarte a sobrevivir.\n\n\n\u00bfAquello que realmente importa? El amor.\nEl amor para demostrar a tu compa\u00f1ero de aventuras que puedes comunicarte con \u00e9l y vencer juntos a los enemigos. El amor por rescatar a todas las criaturas perdidas (y con los beneficios que all\u00ed se obtienen). El amor cuando extra\u00f1as a tu compa\u00f1ero cuando juegas en solitario, pues jugar en pareja con quien prefieras es una experiencia genial que no deber\u00edamos perder. El amor por mapas que realmente fascinan. El amor por este tipo de juegos.\n\nLovers in Dangerous Spacetime es un t\u00edtulo divertido, cargado de un humor muy sano, con un ritmo fren\u00e9tico y una curva de aprendizaje alta, con mensajes entra\u00f1ables y una est\u00e9tica adorable. \u00bfEstresante?

The game was released on Steam and Xbox One in September 2015 by indie developer Asteroid Base.\n\nWhilst the game is focuses on the co-op element, the game can be played alone. You are in command of a space ship with a companion, in the single player this is a partly UI controlled pet, dog or cat, when playing co-op, the other player controls this character. The space ship has various seats that must be commanded in order for that part of the ship to be active, the seats consist of outer canons,  rotating gun, shields, maps and boosters; so that means only two parts of the ship can be active at one time. When playing single player, the UI controlled companion makes for a perfect rider of the ships weaponry as they can shoot targets even when you can't actually see them on the screen. I was quite happy to man the direction of the ship for the majority of the play through and just used the companion to switch between the more skill targeted seats. The actual aim in the game is to collect kidnapped space bunnies - these are spread out across the levels and some are not easy to find due to a fog of war feature also being included.  Whilst exploring and destroying other enemies, you will collect upgrades for your ships; these upgrades can be used on any of the ship's compartments, such as turning your canons into rail guns, or upgrading your ships boosters to go even faster.\n\nLovers in a Dangerous Spacetime has a really neat graphic style - the neon art really shines through and actually fits in well with the gameplay. The bosses in this game look awesome; they look like something a child would drawer but have a real mature look about them. There isn't any voice acting though which I thought is a real shame given that there is a fair amount of text to be read. The soundtrack is stellar, and all of the sound effects are nice too. \n\nThere are two levels of difficulties, easy and medium. I actually found the medium level to be really intensive, and actually had to drop the difficulty down on some of the levels - it's nice to see a game have challenging gameplay. This game takes a huge amount of skill to master it properly.  \n\nEvery level in Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is randomly generated; meaning no play through is ever the same. There are four chapters, and each chapter consists of four levels with a boss fight at the end. All of the regular levels have the same aim as noted above, collecting the space bunnies/frogs/ducks and foxes.\n\nI finished the game in just under four hours; so it is fairly short, but it has the added bonus of having the local multiplayer option which is absolutely huge - this ramps the replay ability up tenfold for me, given that all of the maps are randomly generated, you can play this game for hours on end with a buddy on the couch.  \n\nTechnically, this is a sound game; I was able to play on 4K resolutions, with in game options too.  A controller is recommended to play though; whilst keyboard and mouse is viable, you will definitely get more out of using a controller as the analogue stick makes a big difference when controlling the ship. The game does offer a fairly expansive tutorial too; and this gets you to grips with the controls very easily as it guides you through everything step by step. \n\nIn conclusion; Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is a top notch title; a really fantastic art style and with an innovative take on the co-op controls of a ship, this is special game. If you only plan on playing this game on your own, you may find the price tag of \u00a310,99 to be a little much, but if you are going to be playing it on co-op with friends, then you are going to get more than your money\u2019s worth out of this game. This is certainly a game to keep installed even after completing it!\n\n[b][u] Tom's Score Card[/u][/b]\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n[b][u]4) Recommended[/u][/b]\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The concept is simple: fly around the star system, save the inhabitants of that particular galaxy (so far, I've encountered bunnies, frogs, and foxes) collect the gears needed, and fight the boss, but with the brilliant way the co-op is implemented it becomes a very addictive and fun action game.\n\nDefinitely, definitely play with a friend for this one, as it's pretty much half the fun of this game when one of you is piloting the ship and trying to run around not punching each other off stations when the enemies are shooting at you.

You just make the ships a bit more intricate.\nI definitely recommend this game, but to the devs:\nLOCAL CO-OP ONLY IS A BAD IDEA.\nFix this, and I'll play the hell out of it with my friends.", "timestamp_created": 1444601664, "timestamp_updated": 1444601664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515264", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18425530": {"recommendationid": "18425530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078002628", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512224044}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uba40\ud2f0\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \ub85c\uceec\uba40\ud2f0\ub77c\ub294\uc810\ub9cc \ube7c\uba74 \ud6cc\ub96d\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1444558669, "timestamp_updated": 1444558669, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18406604": {"recommendationid": "18406604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107385672", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444440716}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game like on a sudden impulsion and well I find it very original and interesting gameplay.

Love is the flavour of everyday\u2026. Interplanetary peace and love, should we say! Unfortunately, an error in the matrix (in the Ardor Reactor) has damaged the reactor. An explosion occurred and as a result it split in four pieces. But this is the least of your predicaments; the fault allowed the dark forces of Anti-Love to breakout and spread through the galaxy. Your goal is to recover the four pieces of the reactor to save the galaxy.  \n\nLovers in Dangerous Spacetime is a local co-op game setup in a space environment.  You and your AI companion (or a friend in local co-op) will be in command of a circular spaceship prototype to save the galaxy. The vessel has eight stations, four guns (north, south, east and west), one shield, one scanner, one super weapon and one engine station. All can be upgraded by collecting gems and you could end up with an interesting combination of weapons, from lasers to missiles or even a giant flail - how cool is that? You will have several missions per sector and will have to save a minimum of five folks (bunnies or frogs) to unlock the escape portal to finish your assignment. You will face a good mixture of enemies (including bosses) in well-designed levels. Also, every time you start a new campaign, levels will randomly generate themselves which adds so much in terms of replay ability. \n\nI would strongly recommend using a gamepad for this game as the keyboard setup is actually not the way to go. The game runs brilliantly and the artwork is cute.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tGreat co-op game\n-\tChallenging\n-\tGood artwork\n-\tAchievements\n-\tTrading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tDoes not have online co-op\n\nAn incredible local co-op game!

When I first saw the demo at the EMP Museum, I was drawn to its bright, colorful graphics. Simple, cute, but not childish. I first thought that saving bunnies was a silly concept, but I soon realized that Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime took more strategy and skill than what first appears to the eye. \nNow that I've played through the first campaign on solo, and played a few levels of co-op I can definitely say that this game lived up to and exceeded all my expectations.\n\nWith just two nauts controlling the ship, gameplay can become quite hectic and challenging. But that's half the fun! In solo mode, you get a trusty AI dog/cat that you can command to man the different stations with you. They are quick to respond and generally shoot at what you want. (Sometimes they start shooting asteroids when there are enemies that need to be gunned down first!) \n\nGameplay is challenging, and rewards players for exploring the map. If you find a \"?\" box on the map, shoot it open and you might get a gem you can use to power up a station! (Different gems and gem combinations change how your station is upgraded.) If you take extra time to save all 10 bunnies on a map (minimum of 5 unlocks the portal to the next level), you gain rank faster and can unlock more ships and gems slots for your ship stations. Customize your ship stations for your gameplay style!\n\nLovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is advertised as a couch co-op game. I'm not sure why people are so angry that there isn't online co-op. The gameplay style of this game takes me back to the days of co-op arcade games, or cramming all my friends and family in front of one television as we all take turns trying to beat our own records on the old gaming consoles. Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime is one of those games that makes you want to invite friends over to beat together. I feel that the player experience would be different and not as special if this was not a local co-op game. But if there was an online co-op mode, you can bet this game would still be just as fun!\n\nTL;DR - This game is quickly becoming one of my favorite co-op games. Highly recommended!!

Unfortunately the game doesn't have an online mode at this time so you will need to play the game locally.\n\nWhat makes Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime such a great co-op game is that you need to work together in order to be successful. Your ship has many different stations and since you can only control one station at a time you need to work with your teammate in order to avoid destruction. The battles in particular can be really enjoyable as you are running all over your ship to get into a different station in order to destroy your enemies. \n\nThe game has a couple small issues mostly revolving around sometimes having to spend too much time exploring, but they don't really hurt the experience. \n\nIf you really like co-op games and the concept sounds at least somewhat interesting to you, I think you would really enjoy Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game.\n\n[url= http://www.geekyhobbies.com/lovers-in-a-dangerous-spacetime-indie-game-review/] Read My Full Review [/url]\n", "timestamp_created": 1442604507, "timestamp_updated": 1442604507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539823", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18086592": {"recommendationid": "18086592", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962336650", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483418067}, "language": "english", "review": "<3 Xido <3 XoXo", "timestamp_created": 1442596907, "timestamp_updated": 1442596907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18083655": {"recommendationid": "18083655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003048262", "num_games_owned": 819, "num_reviews": 150, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442500513}, "language": "german", "review": "Cuteness overload mit Koop-Modus sozusagen - das ist Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime.

In Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, your skill to work, and cooperate with somebody is exactly what will be put to the test in this addictive and fun action game. You can only man one post aboard a vast adorable spaceship, either man the guns or take the helm and maneuver through enemies. It's this dynamic gameplay that makes the game so simple but challenging at the same time. There are times where you both have to man turrets, abadon combat and just use shields and run for it. All this takes quite a bit of coordination. To help you are Space gems, wonderful little items that give the ship great customization as they change the way weapons, shields, and the helm work. Add on to that randomized maps, unlockable content, adorable bunnies, a great artstyle, and you've got an amazing title. Single players need not dismay, as Lovers does have the option to bring a trusty space cat or dog. Keep in mind though that for maximum enjoyment of this game, playing with a friend is optimal. Just remember that relationships/friendships can be hard, add on to that your life depending on somebody else and things get dicey!

The game is essentially the platforming version of the tabletop game Space Alert. Strategy and skill is required to reach various stations that operate your ship such as weapons and thrust. The style is adorable and highly amusing; it is saccharine but tongue-in-cheek. I highly recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1442267041, "timestamp_updated": 1442290763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18036212": {"recommendationid": "18036212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031705386", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451078648}, "language": "english", "review": "It's the best parts of my favourite games all in one.

Esse reator era protegido por uma organiza\u00e7\u00e3o chamada Lovers.\n\nAt\u00e9 que um erro na matriz explodiu o reator, fazendo com que for\u00e7a sombria do Anti-Amor se espalhasse pela gal\u00e1xia. O resultado disso: bichinhos fofinhos foram enjaulados!\n\nVoc\u00ea far\u00e1 parte do esquadr\u00e3o dos Lovers, e utilizar\u00e1 a \u00fanica nave sobrevivente do desastre para tentar recuperar os quatro peda\u00e7os do Reator do Ardor, para reconstru\u00ed-lo e salvar o universo.\n\nO jogo \u00e9 composto de 4 campanhas sequenciais, cada uma delas contendo 4 fases, e uma fase de chefe. As fases s\u00e3o procedurais, isto \u00e9, a cada visita, ter\u00e3o layout gerado aleatoriamente, aumentando bem a rejogabilidade.\n\nPossui uma gama de progress\u00f5es permanentes, e tamb\u00e9m algumas tempor\u00e1rias, v\u00e1lidas apenas durante cada campanha.\n\nO objetivo prim\u00e1rio para poder passar de uma fase \u00e9 resgatar bichinhos-espaciais c\u00f3smicos para poder progredir. Cada fase possui um total de 10 bichinhos enjaulados, variando os bichinhos entre coelhinhos, sapinhos, gatinhos ou passarinhos, com fome a campanha. N\u00e3o que isso fa\u00e7a diferen\u00e7a alguma.\n\nDesses 10, s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rios apenas 5 para poder passar de fase. Os outros 5, voc\u00ea at\u00e9 poderia deix\u00e1-los mofando e seguir sua aventura - ao pre\u00e7o apenas de prejudicar a progress\u00e3o de n\u00edvel.\n\nAo passar de n\u00edvel, voc\u00ea ter\u00e1 4 linhas de upgrades, e cada linha possui uma exig\u00eancia de n\u00edvel m\u00ednimo para ter seus upgrades acess\u00edveis, respectivamente n\u00edveis 2, 3, 5 e 8. Os upgrades englobam melhora nas esta\u00e7\u00f5es das naves, permitindo o uso de duas j\u00f3ias simultaneamente (que ser\u00e1 explicado mais adiante), e tamb\u00e9m desbloqueio de naves.\n\nAo iniciar uma partida, voc\u00ea come\u00e7ar\u00e1 escolhendo o seu personagem. Inicialmente, voc\u00ea ter\u00e1 apenas 3 personagens dispon\u00edveis, e poder\u00e1 liberar mais 5. A maioria dos personagens s\u00e3o liberados automaticamente ao concluir cada campanha.\n\nAo escolher uma campanha, voc\u00ea poder\u00e1 escolher sua nave. A nave inicial dispon\u00edvel \u00e9 a Chiclete Zero. As outras naves que liberar\u00e1 com n\u00edvel s\u00e3o a Banana Split e a Gelatina, cada uma com seu pr\u00f3prio layout e peculiaridades de funcionamento.\n\nJoias s\u00e3o a progress\u00e3o tempor\u00e1ria principal durante uma campanha. Voc\u00ea pegar\u00e1 j\u00f3ias ao abrir presentes nas fases, encontrados aleatoriamente espalhados pelo mapa.\n\nS\u00e3o tr\u00eas tipos de joia: de poder, de raio e de metal. Ao pegar uma das j\u00f3ias, voc\u00ea poder\u00e1 coloc\u00e1-la em qualquer uma das esta\u00e7\u00f5es da nave: escudo, motor, canh\u00e3o Yamato e cada uma das torres de armas. Fazendo isso, a joia ficar\u00e1 sobre a esta\u00e7\u00e3o, e imediatamente alterar\u00e1 o funcionamento daquela esta\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nAo passar de n\u00edvel e liberar os upgrades que permitem duas j\u00f3ias em cada esta\u00e7\u00e3o, cada par de j\u00f3ias resulta num outro efeito para a esta\u00e7\u00e3o: joia de poder com joia de metal, joia de poder com joia de raio, joia de raio com joia de metal, ou duas j\u00f3ias de um mesmo tipo. A ordem das j\u00f3ias n\u00e3o faz diferen\u00e7a.\n\nO jogo tem duas dificuldades: normal e casual. No modo casual, enfrentar\u00e1 menos inimigos, que ter\u00e3o menos vida, e voc\u00ea tem mais vida. Certamente \u00e9 um modo recomendado ao jogar com algu\u00e9m que n\u00e3o seja muito bom em jogos em geral. Isso porque a dificuldade normal j\u00e1 \u00e9 bem dif\u00edcil, exigindo muita coordena\u00e7\u00e3o para sobreviver, com muitos momentos de aperto.\n\nA jogabilidade do jogo \u00e9 muito \u00fanica: voc\u00ea ver\u00e1 sua nave como que em uma vis\u00e3o de raio X, e dever\u00e1 andar com seu personagem at\u00e9 umas de suas esta\u00e7\u00f5es. Ao adentrar numa esta\u00e7\u00e3o, voc\u00ea passa a control\u00e1-la.\n\nOu seja: a nave possui at\u00e9 8 esta\u00e7\u00f5es, e apenas duas delas estar\u00e3o ocupadas por vez. Resultado: as tarefas precisam ser divididas, e voc\u00ea por vezes ter\u00e1 que correr entre uma esta\u00e7\u00e3o e outra para reagir.\n\nAo jogar sozinho, voc\u00ea ter\u00e1 um fiel pet para te auxiliar a controlar as esta\u00e7\u00f5es da nave. Ele n\u00e3o possui autonomia: voc\u00ea dever\u00e1 segurar a tecla N, que far\u00e1 o jogo ficar em c\u00e2mera-lenta, e em seguida escolher quais das esta\u00e7\u00f5es ele deve ocupar. A \u00fanica esta\u00e7\u00e3o que ele n\u00e3o ocupa \u00e9 a do controle da nave.\n\nVoc\u00ea enfrentar\u00e1 uma s\u00e9rie de inimigos distintos, cada um com seus padr\u00f5es de movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e ataque. A maioria dos tiros deles podem ser destru\u00eddos ao tomarem um tiro seu.\n\nCaber\u00e1 a voc\u00ea dividir sua equipe entre as esta\u00e7\u00f5es: ocupar duas esta\u00e7\u00f5es de combate, para matar rapidamente os inimigos? Deixar um dos membros no escudo, para garantir a prote\u00e7\u00e3o da nave? Ou deixar um dos membros no motor, para ter mobilidade no combate?\n\nDurante a fase, voc\u00ea encontrar\u00e1 caixas voadoras, e atirando nelas, pegar\u00e1 seus conte\u00fados. Quando com o s\u00edmbolo de interroga\u00e7\u00e3o, os pickups podem conter j\u00f3ias variadas. H\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m pickups que d\u00e3o dados de localiza\u00e7\u00e3o de bichos enjaulados, facilitando assim que voc\u00ea os encontre. Voc\u00ea poder\u00e1 ainda encontrar cora\u00e7\u00f5es, que ir\u00e3o reparar sua nave.\n\nAs fases em geral s\u00e3o retangulares, e possuem um relevo diversificado, onde voc\u00ea precisar\u00e1 contornar muitos obst\u00e1culos. Para auxiliar na localiza\u00e7\u00e3o de objetos e amigos enjaulados, o primeiro recurso \u00e9 o mini-mapa, localizado no canto inferior esquerdo do mapa. Nele, voc\u00ea poder\u00e1 facilmente identificar inimigos, itens, amigos enjaulados e outras coisas mais, te dando uma vis\u00e3o maior do que a da tela.\n\nAl\u00e9m disso, voc\u00ea poder\u00e1 utilizar a esta\u00e7\u00e3o de mapa de sua nave para abrir o mapa, permitindo uma vis\u00e3o total de sua fase, de partes exploradas, n\u00e3o exploradas, e tamb\u00e9m de amiguinhos a serem resgatados, caso voc\u00ea tenha pego algum pickup.\n\nAo localizar um ou mais bichos numa jaula, em geral, basta quebrar a jaula com tiros, que os bichos vir\u00e3o at\u00e9 sua nave automaticamente. Por\u00e9m, fique atento: uma s\u00e9rie de eventos pode acontecer nesse processo.\n\nCada campanha costuma ter uma tem\u00e1tica, e dentro de casa fase delas, voc\u00ea poder\u00e1 encontrar diferentes objetos e varia\u00e7\u00f5es no ambiente.\n\nO jogo possui gr\u00e1ficos simples, por\u00e9m extremamente vivos, com cores fortes e muito contraste. O tra\u00e7ado dos personagens faz parecer que \u00e9 um desenho de Hanna-Barbera - especialmente alguns dos chefes.\n\nA m\u00fasica eletr\u00f4nica acaba por contribuir com o clima louco do jogo. Os sons s\u00e3o bem repetidos e desesperadores, sejam os alarmes, os tiros, ou mesmo os gritos dos bichos enjaulados. O resultado \u00e9 uma atmosfera bem alucinante, que mal d\u00e1 pra respirar e prestar aten\u00e7\u00e3o em cada um dos elementos.\n\nO jogo conta com cooperativo local para 2 jogadores, sem suporte a drop-in. Para jogar de dois, o segundo jogador dever\u00e1 entrar na tela de sele\u00e7\u00e3o de personagens, entrando no lugar do pet do jogador 1.\n\nComo o jogo possui poucos bot\u00f5es e n\u00e3o utiliza o mouse, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel inclusive que dois joguem no mesmo teclado: desde que n\u00e3o haja um limite baixo de teclas no dispositivo. Naturalmente, o ideal \u00e9 ter ao menos um joystick.\n\nSeja pra quem gosta de jogos de nave, seja pra quem gosta de coopera\u00e7\u00e3o com muita a\u00e7\u00e3o independente do g\u00eanero, Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime garante muita divers\u00e3o com um desafio consider\u00e1vel.\n\nAs campanhas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o muito extensas, levando a\u00ed cerca de 4 horas para finalizar as quatro, mas \u00e9 uma medida boa para um jogo local, especialmente considerando que a a\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o p\u00e1ra.\n\nComo as fases s\u00e3o procedurais, o jogo nunca fica enjoativo. Somando isso \u00e0s progress\u00f5es, voc\u00ea ter\u00e1 motivos de sobra para refazer as fases e campanhas - al\u00e9m de se divertir, \u00e9 claro.\n\nO modo casual tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 muito \u00fatil para poder dividir o jogo com pessoas que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o acostumadas com jogos, como namorada ou crian\u00e7as.\n\nAn\u00e1lise completa em http://www.poepra2.com.br/analise/lovers-in-a-dangerous-spacetime/", "timestamp_created": 1442247182, "timestamp_updated": 1442247182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.810127", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18029645": {"recommendationid": "18029645", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983878558", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442486354}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc544\ub984\ub2f5\uace0 \uacbd\ucf8c\ud55c \uc544\ucf00\uc774\ub4dc \uac8c\uc784.\n\uac8c\ub2e4\uac00 \ud55c\uae00\ud654\uae4c\uc9c0!", "timestamp_created": 1442234011, "timestamp_updated": 1442234011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18029239": {"recommendationid": "18029239", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971441472", "num_games_owned": 850, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455064622}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great couch co-op game.

Although, because you're only 2 crew members, it's much more intense.\n\nIn singleplayer, you can tell your AI pet what to take control of. It's very competent and so can use anything but piloting the ship. You need to do that, however you're also free to let go of the wheel and command your shields, or turrets. In co-op, anyone can take control of anything. It's in 2 player mode that the game shines, in my opinion.\n\nYour main objective is to free the set amount of bunnies in each level. Once you've done that, the level exit will open. If you choose to stay and uncover the entire map, look for all possible upgrades and free all bunnies, then each level can take you between 15-30 minutes. On top of that, each time you start a new campaign, levels will be randomly generated, adding infinite replay value.\n\nThe game becomes incredibly satisfying as you upgrade your ship. Different gems can be used to modify different parts of the ship. For example. putting a pink gem on you turret will make it a triple barreled machine gun. Putting a blue gem will turn it into a yo-yo like wrecking ball. Putting a pink gem on you shield will make it cover more of your ship. Putting a yellow gem will make it smaller, but deflect projectiles. You can even combine gems to create different powerups. As you rank up. you can also unlock different ships that have different attributes. It makes the game so much fun.\n\nThe art style is incredibly cute, and the music is cool.\n\nOverall, I think this game is awesome!

Just one look at the screen is all it takes to recognize ABI's articulate attention to detail. The heart melting & cutesy visual style of this game coupled with LiaDS's intense co-op experience keeps me coming back for more. At first glance this game may seem as though it could be short, however, the ever changing game dynamics you encounter within each solar system keeps the game fresh and challenging. Not only will the player encounter new obsticles and enemies, but the biomes in each universe provide new reasons to rethink your tacitcs, loadouts (power-ups), or even the ship you wish to spread the love with. Including the tutorial, there are 5 systems to venture through that each hold several levels, which once again may leave you with a feeling that there isn't enough. Though I'll challenge that notion by asserting that each level can take anywhere from 15 minutes to a half an hour or more. Having said that, the game also provides a challenging normal difficulty that leaves room for the players to improve upon their tactics and teamwork.

You are on a mission to restore love to the galaxy in your spaceship, with either one player and an AI helper, or local co-op. It has a pretty unique gimmick, in that you must move your characters from station to station in order to control parts of the ship you're flying. What this means in practice is that most of the time one person will be flying the ship, while the other moves between the guns and the shields defending you. In special circumstances both players will have to man the defenses while the ship idles.\n\nThe graphics are super cutesy, and they belie the absolutely punishing difficulty of this game. You'll need a competent second player to match the excellent performance of your AI pet, who zips between stations at your command and just kicks butt on the regular. But when things are in a groove and the chaos is all around you, the game is incredibly satisfying. And the good number of power-up combinations keeps things interesting. Just be prepared for the occasional frustration as the hordes of attackers wipe you out yet again.\n\nThe unique mechanic of only being able to control one station at a time makes this game feel like a mix between FTL: Faster Than Light and a shoot-em-up. It's honestly inspiring to see such an innovative gameplay concept these days, when it sometimes feels like all the genres possible have been conceived already. Which is to say, I can see this as the foundation of a new genre, much like Minecraft single-handedly brough the crafting genre into existence. It's that good. I found it intriguing enough that I bought it at only a small discount, which is incredibly rare for me.\n\nEDIT: Having played this game a few more hours, my estimation of it continues to increase.

Throughout the fight you're not feeling engaged in the combat, it's more about moving around so you don't get hit and let your pet do the shooting.

Water planets, ice planets, enemies that can only be defeated by ricochet-ing shots from a star etc. And also unique boss battles for each section.\n\nThere's a nice progression system of upgrades where by saving more bunnies (or frogs) you get more points towards upgrades that unlock stations that can fit more gems to modify your weapons and eventually unlock ships with different layouts. I feel bad for leaving any of the space bunnies behind so I'll definitely be trying to go back to save more of them in future playthroughs. \n\nUnique premise, lovely art style, and really kickass soundtrack.

It is not necessary to play the first game, but I highly recommend it.  After all, [i]Maple Creek[/i] was really a good game, and you'll understand the background and implications of events in this game much better if you play MC first.\n\nThere are three difficulty settings to choose from: Casual, Advanced, and Expert.  The differences are clearly explained.  For example in Expert mode, \"Text tips give less direct hints.\"   The tutorial is optional.\n\nThere are separate sliders for Music and Sound, and we can change the difficulty level at any time via our options menu (thanks devs!)  We can also turn off the voice over, custom cursor, and full screen.  Widescreen is automatically supported, and it looks great!\n\nWhilst playing the game, be on the lookout for \"Ethereal butterflies.\"  These have a bluish glow to them.  Also look for \"Illusive Objects,\" which are morphing items.  There are 30 of each to find, so plenty of fun for those of us who like hunting for these extra goodies.  \n\nThere are achievements, and you can see what you need to aim for by entering the Achievements area via your options menu.  There is also a Help button in the options menu, and this gives ten pages of illustrated, clear instructions for those not familiar with this kind of game, and/or with the evidence board element we have in the Enigmatis games.\n\nYou will see a cutscene as you load the game, and a second one when you start to play the actual game.  The loading-game video is gorgeous, but if you're scared of rats, you might want to skip this one... or close your eyes when you hear squeaking, and wait to open them until it stops. ;D  The initial video (while the game is loading) is not necessary to understand the story -- It just gives you some information about what happened a few minutes before you arrive on the scene.\n\nYour journal has three tabs:  Objectives, Notes, and Illusive Objects.  The first two tabs are pretty useless, at least for me.  There's no extra story in there, and the objectives are pretty clear. The illusive objects are pretty easy to find... for the most part! That's where the journal gets useful.  It tracks how many of the objects you've found, what they looked like, and the order in which they [i]should [/i]be found.  If you see a '?' with objects that you've found all around it, you know that you missed an object in that specific area.\n\nThat brings me to the map, which is next to your journal.  It IS a jump-to map, but you jump to an AREA, not specific locations.  The map will show you which areas are \"active\" (only in Casual and Advanced mode) but of course you don't know exactly which scene in that area needs to have an action taken.\n\nNever fear, though.  Your HINT button gives a directional arrow, should you need it.\n\nThe hidden object scenes vary.  We have highly interactive scenes that are more like puzzles, interactive fragmented object scenes, and the more traditional HO scenes with lists of items to find.  Most of the traditional HO's are lightly interactive, with items listed in purple needing an extra step or two.  On the list-type HOS, you can press the Notes button to play a matching game, instead of finding objects.  The matching game isn't your typical card game setup; it's literally written notes that are scattered about.  Matching requires finding a related picture, ie. a notepad would match with a pencil.\n\nThe devs did an exceptional job with story in this one, using multiple methods to progress the story.  First off we have the cutscenes, which are absolutely gorgeous.  I was VERY happy to see that I could go back and re-watch these scenes once I finished the game -- there were two in particular that were beautifully directed and \"filmed,\" and I really wanted to see them again.  Next we have story sequences that we gain as we find and place lock pieces on a particular door.  There are 12 of these story pieces, and all but the last can be rewatched at any time during the game (but not once the game is completed) by clicking on the piece(s) you've placed.  Lastly we have our Evidence Board.\n\nWhat Evidence Board, you ask? The Evidence Board is an inspired addition to gameplay which is only present in the Enigmatis games (as far as I know!)  As we play the game, we gather evidence.  That's nothing new, we do that in a lot of these games!  What's new is that we literally have a board where we can organize the evidence, and as we do, we come to conclusions that progress the story.\n\nThe whole game is voiced-over, and beautifully done.  Two voices in particular gave me chills:\n[spoiler]The ticket lady (after our first encounter with her), and of course the mysterious man behind the locked door.[/spoiler]\nThe story is engaging, and the whole game entirely immersive.  This is truly a creepy experience, and I have to say that it's one of the scariest storylines I've seen in a casual game.\n\nIt IS a scary game, but the devs injected some humor... Woohoo~!!  A Monty Python reference!  *[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL7n5mEmXJo]starts whistling the lumberjack song[/url]* :whistle: (added a link so no one would miss the joke!) hehehe\n\n[b]Collector's Edition[/b] extras:\n* Integrated Strategy Guide\n* Bonus Chapter\n* 35 Achievements\n* 10 Wallpapers in three different resolutions\n* 8 Concept Art\n* Downloadable soundtrack - six tracks\n* The ability to replay 7 hidden object puzzles\n* 15 replayable cutscenes \n* 10-page Redwood Encyclopedia (very cool!)\n\nTo play the [b]Bonus Chapter[/b], simply click on the Play button on the main menu -- you can now choose between replaying the main game, or playing the bonus chapter.  This chapter takes place approximately 30 years previously, and is played from the [spoiler]ticket lady's[/spoiler] point of view.  If you've played the main game, you know how that story is going to end, but it's nice to see how things came about.  On the plus side, we actually have a reusable pocket knife on us during the whole chapter! :snicker:\n\nThe devs did such a beautiful job with this game that I have only a single gripe, and it's really a pet peeve.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to put it in spoiler tags just in case y'all didn't notice.\n[spoiler]My gripe is this:  The artists chose to use the same color palette for Every. Single. Scene! Meh >_< It doesn't matter if we're inside, outside, underground, or decades in the past, every scene has the same purples and greens. *sigh*  Continuity is of course important, but you can have the same style without using all the same colors!![/spoiler]\n\nOverall, this is an exceptional game in every way, and I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish!", "timestamp_created": 1494470352, "timestamp_updated": 1494470352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.799900", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31669587": {"recommendationid": "31669587", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085689125", "num_games_owned": 815, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494428154}, "language": "english", "review": "Enigmatis 2: The Mists of Ravenwood takes several steps forward over the previous game.

I'm a skeptical son of a gun when it comes to hidden object games. My childhood is gone, and I'm done playing a detective or a journalist.  If I were a main character in real life I wouldn't even try to catch the nuthead killer, I'd just chicken out. How many times the main characters in HOGs find themselves in crucial (I'm talking life and death here) situations and they get out of there unharmed as if it were nothing at all? \nThis game is a sequel to The Ghosts of Maple Creek, which was alright, but lost to The Mists of Ravenwood. The whole idea of the Ravenwood Park is to lure passersby into some kind of utopia and then eat them and leave nothing but their skeletons. It's creepy enough to find all these crashed cars and all the lost items that belonged to the prey. Some of the actors were actually pretty good at voice acting, surprisingly. Great plot with an unusual gameplay (you find some realism here and there), brilliant locations full of mother nature. The hippies are in the game, too. The ending doesn't feel rushed for once. The detective has to do something important in the end, which doesn't take just one swing or whatsoever. For the first time, the main character has to try harder to get it over with, once and for all. This game is probably one of the best HOGs out there.

Dieser Publisher ist f\u00fcr seine hochwertigen Wimmelbildspiele bekannt und gewissermassen der Platzhirsch dieser Kategorie.\n\nDas Spiel schafft es spielend eine gruselige und mysteri\u00f6se Stimmung gleichermassen aufzubauen und eine spannende Geschichte zu erz\u00e4hlen, die mit einigen \u00dcberraschungen aufwartet. Auch hier wirken wie bei Enigmatis 1 Musik, Soundeffekte und Filmsequenzen mit und schaffen es problemlos den Spieler in die Welt von Enigmatis zu entf\u00fchren.\n\nAuch hier l\u00f6st man diverse Minir\u00e4tsel und Wimmelbilder. Diese lassen sich teils leicht, teils schwieriger l\u00f6sen und sind niemals unfair. \n\nFazit: Enigmatis 2 steht seinem Vorg\u00e4nger in nichts nach und zeigt wie Fortsetzungen sein m\u00fcssen.

Most every obstacle and minigame is related to your investigation, you actually have to put together evidence and talk to people, and there are even reasons why you lose your items - things happen to you instead of being static.\n\nThe heroine is driving around searching the killer Priest she dealt with in the last game. She narrowed down his location to \"The West Coast\", only to run into Ravenwood Park - just as the park mascot (giant creepy raven) is in the middle of abducting yet another innocent family. Oh, and the Priest from earlier just dropped by to do battle with the park owner for the right to resurrect a demon overlord. Oh, and the mysterious fellow who helped you out in the last game is also there, for no particular reason. Just having the heroes follow the Priest to the park was apparently too much of a stretch (as was giving them some kind of excuse for spending half the game collecting metal discs in order to free the Priest from his jail cell). \n\nStill though - the plot is head and shoulders above the quality of pretty much every HOG I've played thus far. First HOG to startle and / or scare me on a regular basis. The tree and the raven are genuinely creepy. \n \nThe voice-acting is acceptable, [s]Newt[/s] the moppet you have to rescue only occasionally transforms into a dead eyed doll, and some action scenes are pretty good, though [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrzztaTBHqA]quality is highly variable[/url] even within the same scenes. As long as we're getting sprites + narration, things work. When characters have to move [url=https://youtu.be/eT423uIvWpY?t=13m25s]on screen[/url] things fall apart quickly. (Watch at least the second link)\n\nEdit - the game does insist on you keeping up with the plot and backstory, by periodically returning to certain character who will blah blah at you.

In [i]Enigmatis 2: The Mists of Ravenwood[/i], the hidden objects puzzles are improved upon a bit because you don't just need to find items like you did in the first game, but you often need to click on a container to reveal a hidden object or you may need to click on an item to use it on another item in order to produce the hidden object you need. \n\nIf you don't like 'hidden objects' puzzles at all, there's an option to replace them with 'pair-matching' minigames. You know, the memory game that requires you to remember what picture is on the bottom side of some cards, in order to eventually click on two identical cards and remove these from the board. The goal is to remove all the cards from the board. This may sound like a nice addition, an alternative for those who want it, which is basically true but unfortunately, this is also where they messed things up in the Steam Achievements department - more on that below.\n\nThere are about an equal amount of other puzzles to be solved, and there's the classic exploration and collecting items to use on other items to further the story, like in other point & click adventure games.\n\nThe puzzles in [i]Enigmatis 2: The Mists of Ravenwood[/i] are clever, challenging and fun. Exploring the park is exciting because of the mysterious atmosphere and because advancing in the game (i.e. getting to parts of the park you couldn't go to before) feels satisfying, like you actually accomplished something through thinking and you feel rewarded for that.\n\n[h1]The story[/h1]\n\nThe story is a direct continuation of the story from the previous Enigmatis game, so I recommend you do... \n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/284750/\n\n...and play that one first. In part two, our detective is still chasing the mysterious preacher from the first game. She follows his trail to Ravenwood Park, where she'll discover more than she expected, and not just about the preacher.\n\n[h1]The difficulty and length of the game[/h1]\n\nThe way to advance in the game, be it through adventuring or through solving puzzles, is always logical so it's never frustratingly hard. Should you find yourself stumped, there's a hint button that you can press. It will point you to the next point where action is required, or allow you to skip a puzzle altogether.\n\nIt takes about 7 hours to complete the game. Almost twice that much if you want all the achievements. And a lot more hours if you make one single mistake on your second playthrough to get the remaining achievements. \n\n[h1]On Steam's extra features[/h1]\n\n[i]Enigmatis 2: The Mists of Ravenwood[/i] has 6 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game.\n\nThere are 36 Steam Achievements. That's quite a bit more than in the first game. There are more achievements given when you pass certain points in the story. There's also 2 types of 'collectibles' scattered throughout the scenes of the game, which each have 3 achievements tied to them. \n\nThey also added achievements for the pair-matching minigames. Since you can only play [b]either[/b] a hidden object puzzle [b]or[/b] a pair-matching minigame each time, this means that you will need to play through the game twice if you want all the achievements, including the meta-achievement 'collect all the other achievements'. This is a forced way to make it seem like the game has replayability, whereas games like this are completely linear and therefore have no replayability at all. And wait, it gets better! Two things:\n[list]\n[*] you can't start a new game unless you create a whole new 'profile' in the game\n[*] you need to get all the achievements on the same profile in order to trigger the meta-achievement\n[/list]\nThis means that if you forget to click the button to play a pair-matching game instead of a hidden objects puzzle even once, you won't be able to get the achievement for doing all the pair-matching games and therefore the meta-achievement, AND you'll need to play through the entire game anyway because you can't restart the game and you need to stick to the one profile in order to get the meta-achievement. Quite a few people complain about this oversight on the developer's part, and rightly so.\n\nAdd to this the fact that the hidden object puzzles have become somewhat more complex, as explained in the 'Gameplay' section above, but the achievement for speed is still 'finish a hidden object puzzle in less than one minute'. If you want this achievement, you'll stress out completely every time there is a hidden object puzzle, until you trigger this achievement and can start to play more casually, which is what games like this should allow you to do. Also, the first hidden object puzzle where you can actually trigger any of the achievements is quite far into the game so practising and restarting the game until you get it right is not as easy as in the previous Enigmatis game. And looking up a guide or a YouTube movie is only partially helpful because the list of items you need to find is randomized every time you start a hidden objects puzzle.\n\nAll in all, [i]Enigmatis 2: The Mists of Ravenwood[/i] is a great game in its genre and a more than worthy successor to the first game, but this is the first game I ever played where the Steam Achievements ruin part of the pleasantness of the experience instead of adding to the fun. If you don't care about achievements or you're not really a completionist, you're good. If you are a completionist, be warned that you'll need to be very attentive and careful what you do, or you'll need to go through the game three or more times just to get those last two achievements.", "timestamp_created": 1485355481, "timestamp_updated": 1488288901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.655490", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29455588": {"recommendationid": "29455588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282639296", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485271438}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u60ac\u7591\u6c14\u6c1b\u505a\u7684\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u914d\u97f3\u5f88\u5e26\u611f\u3002\n\u6709\u4e9b\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u8fbe\u6210\u6761\u4ef6\u5199\u7684\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u8df3\u8fc7\u3002\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1485235391, "timestamp_updated": 1485235391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29419762": {"recommendationid": "29419762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274101919", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483785533}, "language": "english", "review": "Arftifex Mundi nailed it again! :) \n\n- Beautiful graphics and sceneries\n- Good interesting story\n- Great voice acting\n- Various well constructed mini games and HO scenes \n- Collectables (Important requirement for my taste) \n- Achievements\n\nI DON'T like though that you must choose between HO-game OR Pair-Match game. \nYou can\u00b4t get all the achievements in one playthrough. \n\nI recommend it!", "timestamp_created": 1485085338, "timestamp_updated": 1485085338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29419438": {"recommendationid": "29419438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067855435", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485165127}, "language": "polish", "review": "Super gra!

The plot was interesting because I already knew some things from the previous game and the story continued. For a person who doesn't own the first part, the idea is probably going to be kind of old (save this person, stop the apocalypse and the like) but it'd be still keep you curious.\n\nThe graphics are quite nice to look at. It's definitely improvement to the first one. The colors are bright in some areas and dark in others, keeping everything somewhat realistic even with the supernatural elements in the game. People look also more real, not cartoon or manga like, and it truly fits. My only complaint is about the animation. While voice acting is quite good, the characters are quite expressionless in the cut scenes. Even if the character sounds pained, their expressions don't match up. But it's a very minor thing.\n\nA lot of new game elements came to this installment. While you still play as the detective and discover the clues yourself, there's tons of new achievements and morphing objects to find. And butterflies. So you need to be extra observant while playing. It's a nice add.\n\nI enjoyed playing this game. It wasn't frustrating and the visuals are pleasant to look at.

The whole \"mystical\"/\"paranormal\" element came out super heavily, last game it was relatively subtle (subtle enough to be the delusions of a concussed detective). Giant, giant evil flying thing. Weird creepy shifty stuff. It was still engaging enough. Also I swear this woman has a talent for getting potentially brain damaging injuries - which I might forgive her huge, massive lapse in judgement just for that.\n\nI will point out one thing: I wish the woman from the side story had been the MC for the whole series. Desperate and single-mindedly going after a goal. Much more interesting character. \n\nNeat Things:\n* Pair Matching! Suddely decided the hidden object puzzles are the worst thing in existence (even after buying this game and this series?), well give your eyes a break and match some cards. Honestly it gets old after a while, but it's nice to have the option to change the core puzzle type. Sometimes the hidden object puzzles are too much eye strain. \n* Modifiable objects (ish)! Some objects need other stuff to get it to work. Can't just set it down and put junk on top of it. Nah, don't need to drop it on a rock to replace the batteries. Makes things a little more interesting. \n* Fast Travel! Click on a place on the map and boom! There you are! After the tedium of the first game this was a blessing. \n* Random collectibles! Of two types! Tired of just searching for puzzles, then you can search for butterflies and creepy visions of when the world was beautiful and whole. I thought it was pretty neat. \n\nBad Things: \n* The dude. You know who I mean. Not even that concussion can save the detective from my intense scrutiny because c'mon! Major plot hole, in my opinion. Or this detective is really just that concussed. Honestly that trumps every other issue I had with this particular game because I just couldn't fathom how a DETECTIVE could be so dumb. \n* The detective is the herione and not the MC of the side story. I regret deeply. \n\nOverall, this game was a lot more fun than the first one. There were a bunch of improvements to gameplay to make it more exciting and keep the player engaged in the world outside of puzzles. Aside from the detective being concussed (again.

It's an engaging hidden object game which develops the story of the first game in the series into something much more gripping and interesting. I'm really looking forward to the next game.\n\nDrawbacks: As before the bonus adventure is very weak compared to the main game, with some terrible translation into English, and just in general a less gripping story. However, this has improved a lot since the first game. \n\nAlso, you will have to play the main game at least twice through to get all of the achievements, and the game and Steam differ to some degree on counting your achievements. (I believe the game requires you, for example, to find all Illusory Objects and Ethereal Butterflies on a given playthrough, whereas Steam gives you the same achievement even if you find some of them on one playthrough and some on the other. And there were a few achievements I got without being notified, such that I kept trying without realizing they were complete. The second playthrough unfortunately doesn't go *that* much faster than the first. \n\nI would say that total playtime is about four hours for the first playthrough, an hour for the bonus adventure, and three hours for a \"quick\" second playthrough to mop up achievements. This may not sound like a ton of game compared to other genres, but it's on par with most hidden object games and presents a reasonably good story.\n\nAll in all, if you like the genre or liked the

heroine on the hunt for the evil preacher she encountered before in Maple Creek. This game is a direct continuation of [i]Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek[/i] and I highly recommend you play it first before getting into this one. I played this game for the first time a year ago and am now replaying it as I did with the first in series to prepare for the release of the third title. This game expands upon the mythology of the [i]Enigmatis[/i] world, giving us backstory as well as setting the stage for a grand battle against demonic forces.\n\nYou play as the same detective from the first game who, while trying to find the evil preacher, happens upon an abandoned RV. She discovers a little girl named Becky whose parents have disappeared. After Becky herself is kidnapped by a shadowy raven, the detective heads to the nearest place to look for help, a park called Ravenwood. Things quickly get out of control when it is revealed that the park is just a cover for yet another evil servant of the devil who lures people in then kills them by stealing their life force.\n\nI enjoyed the story very much, though it doesn\u2019t have the same gritty feeling as the first game. I personally didn\u2019t like Becky as a character, nor her constant whining about her parents. I know she was scared and was there to heighten the sense of urgency in the game but I didn\u2019t feel attached to her at all and she usually got in the way. It was nice to see Hamilton again, who was helpful to the main character on her mission. Overall, the game seemed like an info dump, throwing out a lot of facts and details about why everything was happening. It both shed light on why the events took place in the first game while also explaining what was happening in this title and setting up things for the third game. \n\nThis game is a hidden object adventure game. It has point and clicks aspects to it as you travel through the park collecting clues and solve mysteries. There are good number of hidden object scenes, you\u2019re given a list of items to find in the scene and some are hidden under other items or require certain actions to find. They\u2019re much more straightforward and less cluttered than in the first game and thus easier to maneuver. Another difference is more puzzles have been added to the sequel, most aren\u2019t too difficult though some require extra though. The evidence board is also back again, letting you feel like a real detective as you go over information you find and piece together theories. The game has a useful map that lets you teleport making it easier to get around and complete tasks.\n\nThe graphics and audio are pretty spot-on in the game. The character models and animations are good and show improvement from the first game, namely Hamilton looks a lot better. He also sounds better as I believe his voice actor is different as well. The game has full voice acting and it\u2019s all well done. I personally found Becky annoying but she sounded like a whiny child so maybe I just don\u2019t like whiny children. This a game with a pretty good production value, time and care when into every background and every item in the hidden object scenes.\n\nPlay [i]Enigmatis 2 The Mists of Ravenwood[/i] is what this all sums up to, but play [i]Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek[/i] first. This series offers a great continuing story arc with engaging characters and interesting mythos. This game is a collector\u2019s edition and has a bonus chapter, though it mainly just explains more about the Ravenwood park. There are Steam trading cards and achievements but you\u2019ll have to play the game twice to get all of the achievements because three require you to play the option matching game instead of doing the hidden object scenes. For me personally, I do feel like the first game in the series is currently the best, however this is a great successor and a must play for lovers of the genre.\n\n\n[h1]Usagi\u2019s Rating[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*][b]Must buy.[/b]\n[*]A good game to buy.\n[*]Only buy if on sale.\n[*]Mediocre.\n[*]Avoid at all costs.\n[/list]\n\n[url=http://lunarproduction.com/]Lunar Productions[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1470801396, "timestamp_updated": 1470801396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710204", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24658592": {"recommendationid": "24658592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301291755", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509889422}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430-\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440! \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430 \u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0451 \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0435, \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u043c \u043d\u0430 \u0430\u0439\u043f\u0430\u0434 \u0438 \u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0443\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u0438\u0437 \u0421\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0430? \u041f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0438\u0442\u0435, \u043f\u043b\u0435\u0435\u0437", "timestamp_created": 1470083674, "timestamp_updated": 1470083674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24651204": {"recommendationid": "24651204", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993857397", "num_games_owned": 670, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489607067}, "language": "english", "review": "A very good HOG where the puzzles fit the story of the game.

The main game is a point & click adventure, but combined with 3 types of sub-games. First there are puzzles, which are usually not too difficult to solve. Second there are the hidden object games, where you need to find a list of objects in a single scene. And third, a simple pairing game if you don't like to find the hidden objects.\nThis is one of the best HOPA (hidden object puzzle adventure) out there on Steam! If you're new to this game genre, give this a try. I found the game addictive as you quickly pass puzzle by puzzle and the story line opens up. Not a must-play game, but quite entertaining.

And according to me Enigmatis is one of the best saga of Artifex Mundi. \n\nAs a female detective (FBI or something) you\u2019re on the track of the demonic preacher of Maple Creek who has gone missing since your last investigation. The trail end at the entrance of a very old  and abandoned park where a lot of people have gone missing. You\u2019ll soon discover that the Ravenwood park is not what it seems to be and that something evil lurks beyond. The bonus story let you play the origins of Ravenwood park, years before the detective arrival. \n\nAs every Artifex Mundi game you can move freely in different area (of Ravenwood park) and need to solve some puzzles and find all objects in hidden objects scenes. The game has (2 or more difficulties?) a guest feature: every one of the family can play an independent save and resume the game where they left it. When you first play the game you\u2019ll have a notebook where you have all your objectives as well as all your notes. Adding to that you\u2019ll have a hint button that will help you in many ways but be warned that you may not use it in any puzzle or hidden object scene (HOS)or investigation scene (IS). Hints can be used to know where you need to go, where is the next interaction or to show an object or clue in an HOS or IS or to skip a puzzle. To conclude this part, you\u2019ll also have an inventory to store useful items through your journey.\n\nAs some Artifex Mundi game, you\u2019ll have some collectibles to find hidden through the sceneries: some grey butterflies (30) as well as some elusive objects. (about 20 or more) Elusive objects are illusion objects: [spoiler]because Ravenwood in set in a very wide illusion[/spoiler] some objects tend to switch between the real and unreal world.\n\nOne of the very good thing of this game is that there are 2 unique features you won\u2019t find in any other Artifex Mundi game:\n\u2022\tYou\u2019ll have a separate inventory for your evidence. You then need to match evidence with the right deduction in order to go further in your investigation.\n\u2022\tYou\u2019ll be able to play a unique memory game whenever you want to skip an hidden objects scene.\n\nThe memory is a mix between the game of the same name and the mahjong. Every tiles are shown on their hidden sides and you can only turn 2 tiles at a time which are above the others. To finish the game you must match every joker tiles (with a star on it) in order to skip every object of the hidden object scene. To match tiles you need to have the right cause \u2013 consequence or container \u2013 content set: like you need to match a pan with a notepad or a bloody knife with a murder.\n\n (*) : \nIn addition to no skip or use any hint while playing every puzzles and Hidden objects scenes, there are more missable achievements. Three of them requires you to complete a puzzle and a hidden objects scene under one minute and the other a matching game within 3 minutes. And 2 others hidden objects achievements ask you to find 3 objects within 3 seconds or to finish a scene with less than 4 misclicks. \nThere are also 2 specific achievements: one requires you to watch every cut scene during the first hour of your playthrough and the other one to perform 3 evidence deductions without making a mistake.\n\nThe game requires you to find every butterfly and elusive object through the game, so I strongly suggest you to follow the steam guide in order to not miss any one.\nFinally if you missed anything while finishing your first playthrough, you\u2019ll need to play the game again with the same profile I guess. (achievements are linked to the profile: you may be able track your achievement in-game I believe) The good thing is you only need to succeed where you failed to get the achievements left.", "timestamp_created": 1468838522, "timestamp_updated": 1468847834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572453", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24377889": {"recommendationid": "24377889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063941743", "num_games_owned": 791, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468784316}, "language": "polish", "review": "Prezent od gazetki Pixel.

found yourself going to Ravenwood. However, a giant raven seems to be interested in you and in the little girl hidden in an trail involved in an accident. When you woke up, everything seems normal but after discovering a prisoner in Ravenwood, you're thrown back to a world of darkness...\n\nEnigmatis 2 is the follow-up of the events in Maple Creek, where you stopped a priest in his way to eternal life. However, Hamilton, the detective investigating his lover's disappearence since 30 years ago, disappeared with the dagger. Now, two years after, you're still searching for them, as you fear that the preacher will not stop and that Hamilton is still out for spilling his blood. However, here, you have to save a little girl and her parents from a terrible fate. A prisoner will help you in your deductions and tell you the story of these disappearances. The plot is well-written and because Ravenwood was released on Steam before Maple Creek, I hadn't any clue about the twists happening later because I didn't have these references. It means that Ravenwood works perfectly as a stand-alone and that you don't need the previous story to understand everything (in reality, in Ravenwood, you'll get the whole picture of the situation). Seeing how the plot ends, it's clear that it's missing a third chapter and I hope to see a sequel one day.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's the standard one: use items, find them, clear hidden objects scenes, solve puzzles. However, in addition of that traditionnal gameplay, you can find for hidden objects scenes two ways to play them: shapes and words. Also, the return of the investigation board is also a nice way to keep being focused on the case and to unlock new objectives. Generally, these deductions will grant you more questions to ask to the prisoner and he will give you also items needed to advance. Finally, Enigmatis 2 doesn't suffer of a problem of navigation, like I had in Maple Creek. You don't have to fear a misclick now.\n\nThe graphics are also quite good. I really liked the switch between an illusion world and the reality. Too bad it's only happening once. But you can find leftovers of it thanks to objects changing forms in the scenes. And given the fact that you need to find them for an achievement, it's quite amusing to hunt them down. Another good idea was to make some statues \"alive\" (eyes moving, head turning, etc...) to strenghten the feeling of being watched, so that you're not at ease at all in this desolation. However, contrary to Maple Creek, which was a town, here, you're in a national park, surrounded by nature and cabins.\n\nThe soundtrack is as usual good and the voice acting is perfect. I've nothing to say there.\n\nSo in other words, Enigmatis 2 is an excellent casual adventure game, delivered by Artifex Mundi themselves. The game is really worthy of a purchase at full price but Artifex's games are often discounted in the weekly sale or in bundles.

I could also lock the inventory. Naaah - changed from 7 to 8! :)\n\n[b]Story: 8 / 10[/b] - slighty less interesting than the Maple Creek story (begging was amazing, the mid game poor and  end game - very good)\n\n[b]Music: 10 / 10[/b] - this time it was pure perfection\n\n[b]HOG: 4 / 10[/b] - ... yea... One thing I could skip all HOGs and play some memory instead and the second - it was SUPER easy when I wanted to have a harder ones... This is a wrong direction :(\n\n[b]Puzzles: 3 / 10[/b] - I wish I could make it higher than before (4) because there were muuuuuchh more of them. Unfortunatelly - they were SUPER easy, instead of 2 maybe 3 of them which was average. Sum: +2 for amount, -3 for much easier tasks\n\n[b]Using items puzzles: 6 / 10[/b] - again! I wanted to give more because there was much the puzzles of that kind and I felt much more joyfull solving them... But unfortunatelly - there were TOO many situations, where I had few items for prize / prise (~?) something (crowbars, knifes, sticks, brenches, etc.) but NOPE - YOU MUST DO IT WITH ANOTHER ITEM :I\n\n[b]Locations: 5 / 10[/b] - It started really good, oh man! Really really good! But more and more time I played it, it wasn't interesting, shocking or atmospheric for me. And most of the times - I didn't need to go back... :/ It was just move forward and forward...\n\n[b]Ending: 10 / 10[/b] - Shhh... It's a secret :) I can only tell this is a GOOD direction! :))\n\n[b]Protagonist: 8 / 10[/b] - YES! I demanded and I got it! In Ravenwood there is so many of our hero, so we can finally get to know here a little bit more! We could be her!\n\n[b]Logic: 7 / 10[/b] - it was ten minus two, for YOU MUST PRISE IT WITH ANOTHER KIND OF CROWBAR! and minus one for few little amuzing situations\n\n[b]Duration: 8[/b]\n\n[b] DLC: 4 / 10 [/b] - boring, boring and again - boring. Again it was short and had many HOGs inside, but I finished it just for sake of 100% completion and for ending expansion.\n\n[b]Achievements: 5 [/b] - It was really hard to rate this detail. Collection illusions and butterflies was a challenging task.\nI don't know about butterflies, but illusions collection had at least one situation, where you could gather it only once per gameplay. Guess what - I missed one of them...\nThere were also a bad achievements.

The story is interesting, the voice acting is decent, and most importantly, the puzzles feel engaging and relevant to the story. The character animation is the standard \"possessed animatronic robot\" level, but you don't have to see too much of it. Secrets and collectible objects hidden here and there really motivate you to keep an eye open for the little details. I was pleasantly surprised by this game. I started playing it as a time killer, but found myself really drawn in to it in a way I hadn't with other games of this genre.\n\nMy one complaint is the final achievement which you win \"for getting all the other achievements\". What it doesn't say is that it isn't referring to Steam achievements, but in-game achievements (which are the same as the Steam achievements). Why does this matter? Because you have to get them all on a single profile. I finished the entire game a second time (on a second profile) and got all achievements only to find I still don't have 100% completion.

Believing the elusive Maple Creek Preacher is involved, she goes there.  While driving through a remote part of the redwood forest overlooking the coast she is nearly hit by a black cloudy flying \"thing\" before encountering what appears to be an accident scene involving a family camper.  No accident, as it turns out when the black cloudy raven with red glowing eyes attacks again to retrieve the girl child who escaped the first time.  Drawn both willingly and cautiously into the dark sinister world of Ravenwood Park, (most probably an unregistered and unheard of tourist stop about the past lumber industry), she once again encounters dark and evil forces at work as she thrives to rescue the captured family.  Old friends, new friends and a lethal enemy.  Be warned, friends are only enemies with mutual goals.\n\nGameplay: Hmmm....I must digress slightly here.  I will compare this to Enigmatis: Maple Creek first, since generally fans of a particular company will play the sequel (or more) even if they hated the previous game if they like the company that made it.  (Or there was spectacular advertising,)  \nFirst of all Enigmatis: Ravenwood plays so much easier then Maple Creek.  Artifex Mundi turned the volume down on the horror and suspense but upped the creepy and supernatural elements, yet left all the mystery, anxiety and urgency.  Like that or not, this game is PG, not PG17, and I for one thank Artifex Mundi for doing this.  Even the few jump scares (mostly at the beginning) were not that bad.  Though I must say there were some truly terrifying and horrifying scenes in this game.\nThe second thing Artifex Mundi did was stop being \"jerks\" in the hidden object scenes.  (\"Jerks\" by my definition make find clues in hidden object scenes so hard or so obscure the find clue is nearly impossible to locate.) Thank you for that too.  Ravenwood plays like a dream compared Maple Creek in that aspect.\nThird thing:  There is a no-penalty fast travel map.  Thank you so much.\n\nNow just about Ravenwood, well almost, since it retains the same investigation \"evidence board\" as the first game.  The \"evidence board\" is where our detective places all the clues she finds and groups them together in circles concerning a certain subject like identity, location, crime, suspects, etc.  This is a clever mechanism for storytelling and informing the player what has been and still needs to be accomplished, as well as subtly reminding the player this woman is a resourceful detective.  (In my opinion she is just as resourceful as Macgyver.)  If this series continues, I do hope they continue using this play strategy, it is very different from other games.   One even gets an achievement for finding all the evidence, and another for conditionally placing it correctly.  Now that is clever. \n\nThe Hidden Object scenes vary from straight find lists with the added extra twist of locating the object first such as in a drawer or pouring a glass of wine from a bottle, to what I call shape picture puzzles.  (Those are the puzzles that show a shape that must be found first then used, such as the shape of a key which once found opens something.)  Not so easy to be simple (They did not overcompensate from Maple Creek.) but not so hard the gamer rage-quits either.  Just good even average on the difficulty level. \n\nThe actual puzzles are easy to understand and relatively challenging.  I do believe I noticed that as the game progressed the puzzle challenges slowly increased in difficulty as did actually finding all the pieces of the puzzle.  By the end of the game as the game scope narrows the player frequently has an empty or near empty inventory.  For me it increased the \"felt\" urgency as if I could actually be late and \"not save day\".\n\nThis game (probably due to the age) introduces the alternate hidden object play I have come to think of as one of Artifex Mundi's signatures.   Instead of doing the hidden object scene, one can play a matching game instead.  (This is Mahjong in the Nightmares from Deep series).  Unfortunately this also requires a second playthrough if achievement hunting.  I really wish Artifex Mundi (or any game developer for that matter that forces a second playthrough) allowed the other set of achievements (play all hidden object games or play all alternate games) to be gotten by the playing all the hidden object scenes in the extras as one or the other.  \n\nThere are two sets of extra find objects.  One the \"Illusion\" objects that even though they fade in and out, do so rapidly and are quite large.  It is very hard to miss these.   The Illlusion changes from well maintained to decrepit abandonment, which is in keeping with the Ravenwood game theme.  These are kept track of in the notebook at the back, which is a very nice touch.  The second set are the \"Ethereal Butterflies\"  These are easier to miss 1) because they are smaller and 2) the gamer gets distracted.  Make sure to get them before moving on, there are one or two the gamer can not go back for.

el desarollo de los juegos de objetos ocultos. \n\nEn Enigmatis 2 todo es mejor, todo es mas bonito... y todo es mas satisfactorio. La trama sigue la historia que nos presentaba el primer juego y es realmente buena, con mucho potencial. Los puzzles, si bien siguen siendo faciles y asequibles, estan muy bien dise\u00f1ados e intentan plantear situaciones nuevas al jugador veterano de este tipo de juegos. \n\nLa jugabilidad es lo mejor de todo. El juego es divertido e intuitivo, todo encaja a la perfeccion y nos asegura un par de tardes muy entretenidas si nos gustan este tipo de juegos. \n\nY lo peor del juego es, a parte de ser muy facil, que al igual que nos paso con la primera entraga... el final de la segunda nos vuelve a dejar con la miel en los labios a la espera de la ultima entrega de la saga. \n\nRecomendado a todos los jugadores que disfrutan de las aventuras y los puzzles en general.\n\nImprescindible para los que frecuentan el subgenero de los objetos ocultos. \n\n\n8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1440322734, "timestamp_updated": 1440322938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596616", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17599180": {"recommendationid": "17599180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020706025", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476179644}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430, \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043c", "timestamp_created": 1439908947, "timestamp_updated": 1439908947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17572462": {"recommendationid": "17572462", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984793828", "num_games_owned": 1399, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466556312}, "language": "english", "review": "Done in a couple of hours, all done except for one shitfy object.

Desde el punto de vista t\u00e9cnico, las animaciones de los personajes est\u00e1n mucho mejor realizadas llegando a un gran nivel, sobre todo las animaciones de la ni\u00f1a peque\u00f1a que son fabulosas, para ser un HO, y bastante reales.\n\nEl argumento est\u00e1 mucho m\u00e1s elaborado, con giros argumentales bastante currados que hacen ver lo mucho que han trabajado a este respecto en este juego, y la ambientaci\u00f3n es simplemente fabulosa. Si en la primera parte nos encontr\u00e1bamos en un pueblo p\u00e9rdido de Norteam\u00e9rica, en esta ocasi\u00f3n viajaremos a un parque tem\u00e1tico p\u00e9rdido en medio del bosque. \n\nLos puzles a su vez, son mucho m\u00e1s originales que los de la primera parte, aunque su dificultad sigue siendo bastante asequible, y las partes de HO est\u00e1n mucho m\u00e1s elaboradas, teniendo que buscar determinados objetos para interactuar con otros de la pantalla de HO y de este modo poder encontrar realmente el objeto que necesitamos.\n\nA casi todos los niveles, Enigmatis 2: The Mists of Ravenwood es un juego realmente notable.\n\nEl \u00fanico \"pero\" que tiene el juego es su lamentable traducci\u00f3n al espa\u00f1ol. Traducciones realmente p\u00e9simas que no hacen sino confundir al jugador, e incluso algunas veces los di\u00e1logos dicen cosas que realmente no est\u00e1n diciendo.\n\nPor ejemplo, la detective necesita una llave para abrir algo, y en ingl\u00e9s dice \"Falta la llave para poder abrir esto\" mientras que la traducci\u00f3n dice \"No puedo perder la llave con esto\"; otro ejemplo se puede ver en los HO, traducir \"Coffee can\" (Lata de caf\u00e9) como \"Cafe puede\"; o que en los di\u00e1logos, los personajes se refieran a tu personaje en masculino, siendo como es una detective, o que ella le hable a los personajes refiri\u00e9ndose a ellos en femenino cuando son masculinos o a los femeninos en masculino. Es que no dan una. Un aut\u00e9ntico desprop\u00f3sito. Si fuera por la traducci\u00f3n, le pondr\u00eda al juego un cero directamente.\n\nSin embargo, no todo est\u00e1 tan p\u00e9simamente traducido, y se puede seguir la historia sin mayores problemas. Por lo cual, esto no ser\u00e1 un impedimento.\n\nEn resumen, Enigmatis 2: The Mists of Ravenwood es un producto muy notable.

Opet se jedna o solidni detektivni adventuru s minihrami, ktera ma proti predchudci klady i negativa, takze ve vysledku hodnotim stejne. Zaporem je pro me prilisne zenske ladeni interfacu. Zatimco prvni dil byl celkem neutralni, tady si muz-hrac hnedle vsimne casteho uzivani fialove/ruzove, vsak uz samotny kurzor takovy je. Taky trochu kycovita rodinka, kterou hrac zachranuje, v cele s malou holcickou tomuto pocitu jen pridava. \nVse ostatni je ale bezva a nemam moc co vytknout. Konecne je hra v nativnim 16:9, screeny jsou opet pekne prokreslene, a cele umisteni do sekvojoveho lesa je prijemnym napadem. Pribeh je logicky, umisteni i uzivani predmetu taky. Hadankove minihry (puzzly) jsou sice trochu primitivni (vetsinou se jen neco otaci nebo posunuje), ale aspon nebrzdi tempo. Krome klas. hidden object screenu (HOS) s text. popisem predmetu je tu i jakysi mix s minihrou, kdy maji predmety ikonky, podle kterych se hledaji, a nakonec se z nich slozi nejaky uzitecny item. Zakys jsem zadny nemel, coz me tesi. \nCelkove bych rekl, ze je \"Ravenwood\" o neco lehci nez jednicka. Opet se vam vse krasne zapisuje do deniku a interface je maximalne user-friendly (funguje presouvani pres mapu). Ale v cutscenach uz mi to trochu vadilo, protoze zbytecne dopodrobna vysvetluji casto ocividne veci. Prece jen tenhle typ her nehraje zadny idiot, takze spoustu veci hrac davno vi, nez mu to cutsceny vysvetli jako diteti. Vsak i \"tajemnou\" totoznost vezne, ktery vam pomaha s dedukcemi, hrac odhali velmi zahy, zvlast pokud hral prvni dil, coz je vpodstate nutnost. Ale tak budiz no, system hry je takto delany, ze po kazde dedukci a postupu v pribehu vam to hra \"zrekapituluje\". Atmosfere neni jinak co vytknout. Opet mi ale vadi otevreny konec :( Skoro je to u techto her pravidlem, ze se delaji jako trilogie (3. dil ale jeste neni bohuzel), takze zaver zase nic neresi (bonusova kapitola je opet prequelem). \nJeste bych si rypnul do achievementu. Pro 100% musite hru dohrat 2x (jednou s HOS, jednou s pexesy), coz je dost otrava, protoze adventury jsou pokazde stejne, maximalne se trochu zmeni predmety v HOS. Naopak treba neni zadny achiev za expertni obtiznost nebo dohrani bonusove kapitoly, coz je hloupe. Ale jsou to jen detaily na jinak zabavne hre. No a je to CE, takze dostanete napr. wallpapery a soundtrack. A pokud si ji stahnete z Alawaru, tak je i kompletne cesky.

Often enough the rest is fun too though. \n\nFirst (as I had to scroll through endless reviews to find that information): There's fast travel. Though a bit compressed, you get to jump to one place from where you can reach a few other locations. I prefer a spot on the map for every location.\n\nThe story here is interesting, though the twist is a bit obvious. I kept saying to the game, [spoiler]\"It's the Priest.\"[/spoiler] but would it listen? Also, the background rubbed me the wrong way. I don't mind obvious myths put into games, I do mind myths put into games that far too many people world-wide think are real. Makes it look like the game claims it's real.\n\nThe hidden object games are just right for my taste (medium difficulty), no endless searching for the last invisible object. I also like that you return to previous spots to find more objects from the same clutter. I think for once that part was the most fun (what with all the other things I complain about).\n\nThe puzzles are ok. Got a bit used to ever the same kind by now, though, the novelty has worn off a bit.\n\nThe pair matching as alternative to the hidden object games is a bit weird. Other alternatives I've seen were more fun. I hope they don't put this one into other games. (Playing through again for that was no fun, just a chore.)\n\nI don't like the achievements at all. Especially \"find n of whatever for an achievement\". That just distracts from the story and hampers immersion. At least in the second play through I only had to find the ones I missed the first time round. Trying to get all the butterflies in one play-through in-game, even with guide, still failed. Must have been distracted by the game at some point and missed one.\n\nAnd I'd much prefer the achievements for all hidden object/all alternate games could be done via the extras, not needing a 2nd play through (which, due to achievements, is still more concerned with them than the story and scenery, never mind that all the cut scenes just get skipped). \n\nI also don't really need cut scenes. I'd rather play than watch something doing its own thing. Plus, the butterfly on the teddybear goes missing within one scene early on. There in one position, gone in another.\n\nFor once I didn't turn the music off first thing, and apart from a few times where it became a bit repetitive, it didn't bother me.\n\nIt's a nice game, but would have been a lot more fun without those stupid achievements. I was hoping for something mystery when it turned up on sale on my wishlist. Starting it eagerly with enjoyment, that was quickly ruined by achievements. (I'm getting ever more annoyed with achievements across all sorts of games.  Recently added Terraria achievements interfered with what I actually wanted to do in the game. A while ago Hexcells achievements about perfection were just plain waste of time due to having to copy a state from screenshot after a misclick, every damn time... They just never add anything, only interfere with actually playing the game.)\n\nI guess there's no hope that Steam gives me a button to simply turn them all off.\n\nOn the bottom line, if they don't bug you, this game is recommendable.", "timestamp_created": 1438203029, "timestamp_updated": 1438203091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.390468",

However, what I can say is that it certainly expands greatly upon the story and background of the first game. Giving you insight in to what the purpose of the murders are. You start off two years after the first game, hunting down a lead for the culprit from the last case, only to find yourself attacked by a monstrous raven made of shadow and mist. \n\nThis time, unlike the last one where you had almost solved the mystery before you began, you start on square one in the thick of a supernatural mystery to be solved. With a mission to save the family of a little girl you witnessed being taken by the beast, you must use your wits, and your perception to find clues so as to find who's the culprit behind it all... And how to stop them before it's too late for the family. \n\nAnd, once again, like the last one, you get a bonus after you beat the first game, to get a glimpse in to the past of the life of a surviving victim of the tradgedy. I've yet to play this part myself, but if it's anything like the last game, it's definitely going to be a moving part of the story.\n\n[h1]=The User Interface: 4/5=[/h1] Now, when I played the first game, I was left very impressed with the user interface. But, that's not to say that there wasn't flaws with the interface. However, in the sequel, it seems that those flaws have been taken care of. Not only that, but with the inclusion of new goodies to play with. The map is now separate from the journal, meaning you don't have to go through the journal to reach your map anymore, which did get annoying in the original. \n\nNot only that, the investigations board has definitely been improved, as you now have a mysterious friend to bounce ideas off of, and to discuss conclusions and thoughts to. Which also allows you to reach your friend easier to turn in pieces of a much bigger puzzle, to learn even more about the story. \n\n[h1]=The Gameplay: 4/5=[/h1] The hidden object puzzles are a bit more interesting this time around, so to speak. With more involvement in putting things together to collect them, and putting things together to unlock other things you need. Which, it does give more gameplay for those who want more out of their HOG experience. Sadly, the hidden object scenes are a lot more scattered than the first. But there's a lot more puzzles and plot to make up for it.\n\nHowever, for those who are not exactly good at finding the objects, or get stuck, there's the option to play a pair-matching game instead to collect the items. Which does make things a bit easier if you have an item you just can't find, and you don't want to, or can't use a hint.\n\nThere are achievements for fully playing the game one way or the other, so if you're like me, and you like getting all the achievements in a game, you're gonna need to replay this one a couple times to get all the achievements, unlike in the first where I was able to get all the achievements in one solid run. Which, can be a good or bad thing, depending on your view. \n\nThe puzzles in this one are very nice, and there are maybe one or two that are sort of recycled from the first game, but it's done so in a way that makes sense for the game. The puzzles in here are pretty plentiful, and well done in my opinion. There are some that are definitely difficult as well, so be prepared to put your grey matter to use.\n\n[h1]=The Graphics: 4/5=[/h1] Keeping in with the last game, the items are properly fixed on to the scene, looking like they actually belong in the same setting as the background. But, this time around, the graphic quality of the characters and cutscenes have improved a lot since the first game. Characters don't look quite as awkward when they are speaking, and characters actually move their head when they talk. \n\nThere are a couple problems though. Rarely, the characters mouth tends to look weird, and drop in quality when they are speaking, not as much as the first game though. Also a bit of a problem regarding the little girl's expression not always matching the situation at hand: Looking neutral/happy when she sounds worried, or is scared, so on and so forth. It's not a major issue, but it is something that could use a little polishing. \n\n[h1]=The Music: 2/5=[/h1] Sadly, this is where I have to give a bad score. This is not because the music is bad, no. But because from what I can hear, most of it is recycled from the first game. There are some original scores in there, but the main themes are the recycled ones. But, it's not [i]overly[/i] bad of a offense, considering that the music score of the original did well on setting the ambience of the game. Still enough that I'm gonna have to give a 2 for instead of a 3.\n\n[h1]=The Atmosphere: 4/5=[/h1] The first one's atmosphere was amazing, and this one? It may not have the darker, doom and gloom look to start, but it definitely does a good job on making something feel 'wrong' with Ravenwood park. Don't take the first little segment of the park as the real deal, as things definitely get darker. Which matches the storyline pretty well in my opinion. Things do get quite a bit more creepy and gross in thisgame, and it has more jumpscares than the last, so it's definitely not for the ones who are for more lighthearted HOGs.\n\n[b][h1]=TL;DR/Pros & Cons=[/h1][/b]\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n- Richer plot than the sequel.\n- Improved mechanics from the sequel.\n- More puzzles!\n- A new way to deal with Hidden Object Scenes.\n- More achievements!\n- Better graphics and cutscenes.\n\n[b]Neutral[/b]\n- Achievements will require you to play at least twice through the whole game.\n- A different atmosphere that doesn't make it a 'cut and paste' of the sequel's style. Good or bad, depending on if you preferred the feel of the original.\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n- New pair matching minigame takes away from the HOG concept.\n- Reused music from the first game.\n- A few errors with how the mouth looks when characters are talking. \n- A bit of overuse with some of the jumpscares.\n\n[b][h1]=The Conclusion: 8.5/10=[/h1][/b] The game is a great installment for it's genre, and is a lot more story-driven than the first game. I definitely would suggest this series, and this developer for those who like games of this genre! And I eagerly await the sequel to this game to know what happens next.\n\nThank you for your time, and for reading my review.", "timestamp_created": 1435273962, "timestamp_updated": 1435280040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706034", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16636788": {"recommendationid": "16636788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125664030", "num_games_owned": 756, "num_reviews": 348, "playtime_forever": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434859088}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u901a\u5173\u6492\u82b1\uff0c\u5e7d\u7075\u4e4b\u8c1c2\uff1a\u9e26\u6797\u8ff7\u96fe\uff0c\u4e00\u6b3e\u70b9\u51fb\u7c7b\u89e3\u8c1c\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n\n\u6e38\u620f\u98ce\u683c\u9ed1\u6697\u8be1\u5f02\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u4e0d\u6050\u6016\uff0c\u4f46\u5374\u65f6\u523b\u8ba9\u4eba\u7d27\u7ef7\u7740\u795e\u7ecf\u3002\n\n\u5267\u60c5\u548c\u753b\u9762\u90fd\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u5b57\u5e55\uff0c\u5f88\u6709\u4ee3\u5165\u611f\u3002\n\n\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u79cd\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u662f\u4e2a\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1435027944, "timestamp_updated": 1455596511, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525321", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16587552": {"recommendationid": "16587552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162427383", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417918096}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo muito bom, viciante!!!!\nRecomendo.", "timestamp_created": 1434903726, "timestamp_updated": 1434903726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16561208": {"recommendationid": "16561208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004656732", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469753468}, "language": "english", "review": "For those who enjoy point and click and puzzle games this (and Enigmatis 1) is the best game to get by far! :D The animation, art and story are beautiful and exciting.

It also has all the usual negative:  no saves, and a forced second run to get all Achievements.

It's just pure awesome. LOVE the colorfull arts and everything about it. Can't think of anything wrong with it. The story is great. Really love the Artifex Mundi games (well the like bottom scrape of the gamebox is the \"Time Mysteries\" games (To me anyway, As you get lazy with the timemachine and skip/hint abilities). In this game, That won't happen. The puzzles are too much fun. Altho it would be a good idea to start with the 1st game of this series, So you get some backstory to this game for even more enjoyment. (It's not a waste, 1st game is really great aswell (Also the first Artifex Mundi game i played, and i was hookt instantly. Want them all :3.\nThey have all the good things you would want. Great storys, Fantastic arts, different difficulty settings, Hint buttons (that doesn't speak in riddles, And Skip buttons for the puzzles incase you are really stuck. It will solve the puzzle for you and you can continue, ofcourse). Even alternative minigames incase you don't like the \"hidden object messy screens with tons of items on them). Good voiceacting (and text ofcourse). \"All\" puzzles and such are made for anyone to enjoy (there MIGHT be some occasional exceptions that require to be able to see colors, But thats rare (and even if it is, You can still solve it with some extra effort). Nothings too cryptic nor too easy. The games are beatable by almost anyone.\n37 out of 5 stars.\n\nSO, If you are looking for a great time without headaches & frustration & are into puzzle/hidden object/story games, Artifex Mundi, Games are the right thing for you!, Get this/these game/s, It's worth the default price.

Eine weitere Perle unter den Wimmelbildspielen, die mit sehr viele Liebe zum Detail und einer interessanten und fesselnden Story ausgestattet wurde. Es wurden auch hier wieder toll gestaltete Szenen und Filmsequenzen verwendet, die das Feeling erst richtig aufkommen lassen. Hier hat man sich sogar noch mehr M\u00fche bei der Umsetzung gemacht, als schon beim ersten Teil :)\n\nMan ist wieder als Detective unterwegs und greift, wie auch schon im ersten Teil, auf das bereits gewohnte und vertraute Beweismittelverfahren zu. Somit muss man sich nicht umgew\u00f6hnen. Auf spannende Art wird die Geschichte um neue und altbekannte Protagonisten erz\u00e4hlt. Man erh\u00e4lt zwar schon zu Beginn eine Ahnung, wer wohl mit involviert ist, aber trotzdem bleibt die Geschichte bis zum Ende sehr spannend. \n\nUnd auch diesesmal wurde die Geschichte, die gesammelten Informationen, kleine Schreckmomente, die Infos zu den einzelnen Personen, sowie die R\u00e4tsel und Wimmelbilder sehr gut umgesetzt. Sogar optisch und mit all' den Szenen und Filmsequenzen noch besser als im Ersten Teil - wie ich finde. Wieder ist alles sehr stimmig und die Wimmelbilder bleiben wieder einmal - zu meiner Freude - relativ schwer, sodass man sich wieder ordentlich ins Zeug legen muss, um alle Gegenst\u00e4nde zu finden und ohne L\u00f6sungshilfe die Errungenschaft daf\u00fcr zu erhalten. Also nicht verzweifeln, es ist alles auffindbar, selbst wenn es etwas l\u00e4nger dauern kann ;) Wer also gerade solch eine Herausforderung sucht, dem sei es schon deshalb ans Herz gelegt :) \n\nDieser zweite Teil bietet erneut Spannung, eine sehr sch\u00f6ne Grafik, eine gute fortgef\u00fchrte Story, sowie anstrengende Wimmelbilder. Es ist wieder sehr stimmig und gibt am Ende den Gedankengang frei, ob es wohl noch einen dritten Teil geben wird. Denn obwohl auch hier die Geschichte um die Vermissten Personen - so wie auch im ersten Teil - wieder abgeschlossen wurde, k\u00f6nnte es noch einen 3. Teil geben. Also ich f\u00e4nde es gut und sehr spannend :)\n\nDas einzig \"negative\", wenn man es denn so nennen kann, war auch hier wieder, dass bei den Wimmelbildern manche Gegenst\u00e4nde nicht korrekt ins Deutsche \u00fcbersetzt wurden, was die Suche manchmal etwas erschweren kann. Es ist aber mit etwas gr\u00fcbeln, oder probieren, schaffbar ;)\n\nAls wichtige Anmerkung sei noch erw\u00e4hnt, dass man 4 Errungenschaften nur durch nochmaliges Spielen erreichen kann. Wenn man n\u00e4mlich wie ich, lieber die Wimmelbilder spielt, kann man die 3 Errungenschaften f\u00fcr \"Paare bilden\" nur durch nochmaliges Spielen erhalten - da man sie nur dann erh\u00e4lt, wenn man das gesamte Spiel lang statt der Wimmelbilder die \"Paare bilden\" Spiele spielt. Und erst wenn man auch diese 3 Errungenschaften beisammen hat, bekommt man die letzte m\u00f6gliche Errungenschaft. \n\nDas ist zwar ein wenig unfair, wie ich pers\u00f6nlich finde, aber wenn man es gerade einmal durchgespielt hat, kennt man das Ganze ja schon und sollte somit keine Probleme haben, das Spiel nochmal in locker der H\u00e4lfte der Zeit durchzuspielen. Man kann dabei sogar noch die eine oder andere fehlende Errungenschaft, die man ggf. im ersten Durchgang noch nicht erreicht hat, gleich nochmal mitmachen/nachholen, dann lohnt sich der zweite Durchlauf in doppelter Hinsicht ;)", "timestamp_created": 1422630310, "timestamp_updated": 1422630814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14211017": {"recommendationid": "14211017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020062054", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418545132}, "language": "english", "review": "5/10\n\nPros:\n- Real release.

I particularly liked the little girl in this game and the way that she tugged on my heartstrings and my passionate need to want to protect her and take her under my wing. I love the visuals and music in all AM games but this one really stood out for me and it's a game that I will want to play over and over. Do you like hidden object games? Do you like a good story with a compassionate feel to it? This is the game for you. I loved how all the hidden object scenes were clear and objects are genuinely difficult to find at times but I like a challenging game where I have to work at it. The puzzles are really good and they are quite challenging too. For me, it was a case of whether you are good at something or not. Some puzzles were easier than others but I didn't feel the need to tear my hair out. I also love that there is an option to either play hidden object or mahjong within the game. Everything about this game was exciting and I couldn't wait to finish it if I'm honest. The desire to find out what happens at the end was just too much and I needed to know! Lol. I feel like this with all AM games and it's not that I want to rush the game, I just want to see how it ends because that's how it keeps me gripped from start to finish. Everything about this game was clear, enjoyable and gripping and it's a definitely 10/10 for me. I love AM so much and they never fail to make me happy with their games. Every game is a new adventure. There are secrets, danger in some places, suspense and adventure and I promise you, you won't be disappointed.

Aber jetzt wo ich es durchgespielt habe muss ich sagen, dass es in letzter Zeit kaum ein Spiel gab, dass mich so gefesselt hat. Ich fing an und h\u00f6rte erst wieder auf als ich es komplett durchgespielt hatte. Dabei war ich so in das Spiel versunken, dass ich jegliche kurze Ablenkung durch Andere sogar als nervig empfand, weil ich unbedingt weiter kommen wollte. So etwas passiert mir nur \u00e4u\u00dferst selten und zeigt nur all zu gut wie sehr ich in dem Spiel gefesselt war.\n\nDie Grafik fand ich klasse und passte wunderbar zum Spiel und sorgte mit daf\u00fcr, dass ich in die Welt eintauchen konnte, auch wenn es heutzutage einige Spiele gibt die bessere Grafik haben. Aber ich muss echt zugeben, dass eine bessere Grafik die Stimmung des Spiels wahrscheinlich sogar nicht so gut r\u00fcber gebracht h\u00e4tte wie die verwendete Grafik.\n\nDie Schwierigkeit der R\u00e4tzel waren f\u00fcr mich genau richtig, anspruchsvoll aber doch noch absolut machbar. Dazu muss ich aber auch sagen, dass ich ein sehr logisch denkender Mensch bin und mir solche art von R\u00e4tzeln durchaus liegen. Falls man mal nicht auf die richtige L\u00f6sung kommt, hat man aber trotzdem noch keine Probleme weiter zu kommen, denn das Spiel bietet viele Hilfen.\n\nDie Geschichte fand ich richtig gut und sie hat mich f\u00f6rmlich in die Welt der Geheimnisse um Ravenwood gezogen. Leider musste ich w\u00e4hrend des Spiels feststellen, dass es sich bei diesem Spiel um den zweiten Teil einer Spielserie handelt, in der die Geschichte auf einander aufbaut. Aber ich muss auch sagen, dass ich dank R\u00fcckblenden vom ersten Teil im Spiel trotzdem gut zurecht kam und das ganze mir sogar so gut gefiehl, dass ich mir direkt den ersten Teil geholt habe. \n\nEin Nachteil hatte das Spiel f\u00fcr mich aber leider auch: \nEs mag auch daran liegen, dass ich das Spiel echt genossen habe und ich sa\u00df auch einige Stunden an dem Spiel dran, aber wenn man es durch hat und es einem so gut gefiel wie mir dann will man unbedingt weiter machen, aber man kann nicht. Es erneut zu spielen ist bei weitem nicht mehr so aufregend wie beim ersten mal. Deshalb finde ich die Storyl\u00e4nge zu kurz, denn wenn man es schon nur einmal richtig genie\u00dfen kann, dann sollte man es auch m\u00f6glichst lange genie\u00dfen k\u00f6nnen.", "timestamp_created": 1417995503, "timestamp_updated": 1417996252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13265565": {"recommendationid": "13265565", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049291468", "num_games_owned": 4172, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416432171}, "language": "french", "review": "Superbe ;)", "timestamp_created": 1417944961, "timestamp_updated": 1417944961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.415377", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13265066": {"recommendationid": "13265066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070643061", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418118384}, "language": "english", "review": "capitvating game, the Raven is creepy, puzzles are a little easy but fun none the less.", "timestamp_created": 1417941641, "timestamp_updated": 1417941641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13255184": {"recommendationid": "13255184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066920835", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417972082}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u89e3\u8ff7\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u597d\u50cf\u662f\u4e2a\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u5e26\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4f11\u95f2\uff0c\u91cc\u9762\u8fd8\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6574\u4f53\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5927\uff0c\u6709\u4e2a\u522b\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u4f1a\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ea0\u7ed3\uff0c\u5b9e\u5728\u8fc7\u4e0d\u53bb\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u4e70\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4e00\u5929\u5c31\u73a9\u5b8c\u4e86\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u6709\u70b9\u504f\u8d35\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1417885348, "timestamp_updated": 1417885348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13240263": {"recommendationid": "13240263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077078775", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418478772}, "language": "polish", "review": "Tak jak pierwsza cz\u0119\u015b\u0107, gra po prostu wci\u0105ga.\nDu\u017co nawi\u0105za\u0144 do pierwszej cz\u0119\u015bci gry - nie spoileruj\u0105c przy tym prawie wcale.\nPolecam, chocia\u017c dobrze zagra\u0107 najpierw w Enigmatis: Duchy Maple Creek.\n", "timestamp_created": 1417799277, "timestamp_updated": 1417799277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13218279": {"recommendationid": "13218279", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997172478", "num_games_owned": 2247, "num_reviews": 469, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417644636}, "language": "polish", "review": "[h1]Enigmatis: The Mists of Ravenwood to kontynuacja przygodowej gry detektywistycznej wydanej w 2011 roku.

Die meisten Punkte haben sich nicht ver\u00e4ndert.\n\nInsgesamt empfande ich das Spiel bisher als das Vielseitigste. Die Story hat nun guten Drive (hab den Vorg\u00e4nger leider nicht gespielt und auch nicht im Besitz), auch ohne Vorkenntnisse taucht man schnell ein. Die Landschaft ist besonders gut gelungen. Ein paar Infos \u00fcber B\u00e4ume und Naturparks im Extramen\u00fc nimmt man f\u00fcr das Allgemeinwissen gerne mit. Au\u00dferdem ist es das erste Mal, dass ich in einem AM-Spiel \"Illusionen\" und \"Schmetterlinge\" im Spiel finden musste. Nat\u00fcrlich hab ich beim 1. Mal jeweils einen verpasst (von ca. 30). Das ist jedenfalls ein sehr kuules Moment, kostet aber f\u00fcr Schnellspieler einige Extraminuten. Die WB-R\u00e4tsel sind recht schwer, alle machbar ohne Hilfe, aber den Erfolg mit \"1 Minute\" konnte ich erst in einem 2. Anlauf schaffen und das auch nicht auf Anhieb. Das Zusatzspiel ist dieses Mal weder Majongg noch Domino, sondern eine Art Memory. Ich muss sagen, ich empfand das als durchaus nervig, aber es geht. Bei den Erfolgen gilt hier wieder das alte Motto: 2x durchspielen mindestens. Die Spielzeit betrug beim 1. Mal wieder gute 5-6 Stunden, beim 2. Mal 2-3, also die H\u00e4lfte. Die R\u00e4tsel sind wie immer teils neu, teils recycelt. Am meisten hat mich gest\u00f6rt, dass ich einige Male nicht weitergekommen bin. Das Spiel hat durchaus seine Kniffe, der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist durchaus h\u00f6her als bei fr\u00fcheren Spielen, aber das System nervt mich etwas. Z.B. bei NftD kann man seine \"12 M\u00fcnzen\" bis zum Schluss behalten, die braucht man erstmal nicht. So bin ich auch diesmal rangegangen, aber man kommt nur weiter, wenn man regelm\u00e4\u00dfig seine \"M\u00fcnzen\" bzw. Schl\u00fcssel schon w\u00e4hrend des Spielens einl\u00f6st. Die Story, bei aller W\u00fcrze, ist auch reichlich vorhersehbar. Ich wusste nach dem Intro sofort, wer sich hinter dieser Gef\u00e4ngnist\u00fcr verbirgt. Und auch der \"T\u00e4ter\" wird schon nach den ersten Minuten \"entlarvt\". \n\nSehr positiv ist das wieder vorhandene Bonusabenteuer. Das hat mir diesmal besonders viel Spa\u00df gemacht. \n\nAllgemein: Gute, comichafte Graphik, schn\u00f6rkellose Steuerung, guter Sound, Vertonung ok, faire R\u00e4tselbasis, gutes P/L, sehr gute Story.", "timestamp_created": 1415287288, "timestamp_updated": 1415287288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12814055": {"recommendationid": "12814055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017110772", "num_games_owned": 602, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1415233661}, "language": "german", "review": "In den letzten Jahren ging das Genre der \"Wimmelbildspiele\" ziemlich gro\u00dfe Wandlungen durch. \nAnfangs bestanden sie komplett nur aus Wimmelbildszenen und sp\u00e4ter f\u00fcgte man das Adventure-Element ein, das mittlerweile in so ziemlich allen Spielen dieser Art vertreten ist.

It's great! I'm completely in love with it, though I must admit I'm a huge fan of Hidden Object Games and Point and Click adventures. Even so, this still is one of my favourites to date. \n\nThe game looks positively lovely, every new area entered is another masterpiece. I'm excited about things like birds flying away when hovering over them with the cursor and bushes moving in the background. The sounds (background and general gameplay noises) are amazing and the voice acting is pretty neat! \n\nThe horrorish atmosphere is perfect, be sure to put on a headset! It's a neat blend between horror and casual, especially for a scaredy cat like me. I love mysterious settings and creepy legends but am usually too scared to play them. Psychological Horror and jumpscares really are the end of me, so this is a nice way to get my creepy fix without it ending in being too scared to go to bed at night. \n\nThe puzzles aren\u2019t very difficult but left me pleased when solved nonetheless. The Hidden Object parts of the game aren\u2019t too messy or crowded with items, you can actually see what you\u2019re looking at. You can also switch it up for a Card Matching Memoryish thing, if you\u2019re more into that. At the beginning you can pick a difficulty, making the game harder if you\u2019d wish to do so. I played it on the easiest setting because I\u2019m a huge fan of plots and getting attached to the characters and wanted to focus on that for my first run. \n\nI'm on my second playthrough now, to get all achievements, and I'm still amazed by everything just as I was the first time half a year ago!

Pretty much all dialogue is spoken and even the child voice actress does a very good job.\n[*] Fast travel via map.\n[*] Interesting deduction system.\n[*] Besides the Hidden Objects games and minigame puzzles there are also 'assemble' games as well as Illusive Objects and Ethereal Butterflies to find.\n[*] Decent game length.\n[*] Experienced no game-breaking bugs.\n[*] No broken achievements. A second playthrough is required to get 100%. (Pair matching instead of Hidden Objects.)\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*] Key story elements and even characters are direct references to the previous game Ghosts of Maple Creek. The story may at times be hard to follow if you haven't played that one first. [b]Note:[/b] When I played this game the first Enigmatis was not available on Steam yet.\n[*] When playing for a long time scene transitions start to take longer instead of being instant.

Yes, it is technically a hidden object type game, but there's variety in the types of puzzles.  You can do hidden object minigames or mix it up with a type of two of a kind card matching game.  There are standard point and click adventure elements, very nice graphics, decent sound and voice acting, and a story that's not too shabby.  The story was decent enough that I was a little bit disappointed that the first one in this series wasn't available on steam.  There were numerous references to events that happened in Enigmatis 1, which is not available on Steam at the time of this review.\n\nThis version of Enigmatis, which is actually the Engimatis 2 collector's edition, contains both the main story (about 4 hours long) and a side story that's maybe 1 hour long.  The side story adds a bit of back story to the main, so don't play it until after completing the main game, as it will spoil the few twists in the tale.\n\nMy personal opinion on this game, as with all games, is that fair pricing depends on the value you feel it brings.  This game has very little replayability as it is story based with little variation in puzzles between playthroughs.  The story is relatively short, but it is a great example of a short, casual adventure game.

No longer am I just looking for miscellaneous objects, I am actively engaged with the characters, and cannot wait to find out how I will MacGyver them out of their difficulties!\n\nThe major let down of this title is that it is a sequel, and the first game is not available on Steam.  This is slightly frustrating.  I have not played the original, titles Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek, however, after playing this, I am pretty sure I know the ending of it, which is a shame.  That being said, you can follow the story, and there is definitely no need to have played the predecessor to enjoy The Mists of Ravenwood.\n\nThe only another negative aspect of this game, which is more of an annoyance, than a real criticism, is that the main protagonists voice acting is, at times, a little on the poor side.  However, the other characters are voiced to a much higher standard, and overshadow this minor flaw.  Besides, she actually does not speak enough for it to become annoying, except for in the case of the word \u201cSweetheart\u201d.\n\nThis game is a gem among hidden-object game.  Its quality is something I have come to expect from Artifex Mundi games, the developer seems focused on these types of hidden-object-puzzle-adventure games, and more often than not makes them well.  Excellent stories, backgrounds and characters are always included.\n\nWith three difficulties, (though I would advise avoiding the lowest setting, as those helper sparkles will jump out on you just for taking a sip of coffee), steam achievements, collectables to find and a bonus story to be unlocked there\u2019s a bit to do here, but nothing is overly frustrating.  All puzzles can be skipped, hidden-object areas can be replaced by a matching memory game, and there is the standard hint function to assist.\n\nOverall, if you love these types of games, you really really should play this game.

Some of the greatest I've played through are Zak Mc Kracken and both parts of Syberia. Enigmatis seems to be a great one of these genre. I've played only a hundred minutes but still am at the beginning of the game. The storyline seems to be consistent, the graphics are unique, held in a comic style, the music supports the great athmosphere. While audio is available in english only,  the subtitles are german (localised). \n\nActually I find the game to be a good chance to improve my english language skills while listening to the talk of the characters. \n\n\nThe puzzles - at least till now - are quite easy, if not to say obvious. The story might be scaring for a younger audience.\nSo far I am happy with this buy and I hope this game will be even more tricky in the future. \n\n\nWell it took me 6 hours to complete the game. I have to say the story was great also the athmosphere and cinematics. The music was good but a bit repetitive, although there are different tracks. I give this game a 8/10 rating. \n\n1 point less for the quite short story (I have not yet played the bonus level yet you unlock after the main story)\n1 point less for the quite simple quests compared to others like Syberia and other adventure I have played in the past.\n\nAfter all this game is still a great buy. I only paid 3.24 \u20ac because of a discount I unlocked from some steam collective cards.

On the way she finds a pretty bad damaged camper but it does not look like an accident. You watch for survivors and you find a little girl who is talking about a \u201emonster\u201c and that she misses her mom. Shortly after a big crow is attacking you and takes the girl with her. Shocked and confused you decided to save her and her parents and you start your journey through the mysterious Ravenwood Park next to the camper.\n\nLike a detective you have to find hints and to solve puzzles. You have to find your way through 55 beautiful and spooky locations. You can collect your hints on a blackboard (which is really well drawn with handwritten notes). Besides there are also other small objects you have to find for some achievements. Oh yeah there are 36 achievements and they are not that hard to get. So it\u2019s a good game for achievement hunters! :p If the puzzles are too easy for you, of course you can choose a higher level of difficulty.\n\nReally the story is so exciting that I found myself actually wanting to solve the mystery and I couldn\u2019t stop playing it!

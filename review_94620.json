Hector is a traditional point and click, and it's a fairly easy one - it has some point and click logic to it, especially given by it's twisted style, but it helps with lots of references ingame, and with an ingame full guide.\nThe game is quite mature in topics, but at the same time has crude, juvenile and absurd humour.

The main character is a sarcastic, crude, crass, slob of a detective but with plenty of masculine humour. He's essentially Gene Hunt from Life on Mars/Ashes to Ashes. The humour is quick witted and vulgar. The voice acting and timing of it all is perfect for the characters. The puzzles are logically of maybe a medium difficulty, which doesn't halt story progression. And story and interraction between the characters is key to the enjoyment you get from this game as with any great adventure.

A few environments were re-used in later episodes than EP1, but generally very tastefully so. Less of an issue if you bought all episodes at once so it feels more like one package than individual installments re-using areas.\n\nAll in all I can overwhelmingly recommend it whenever it is on sale.

I'm not entirely sure why it got made as 3 separate games instead of being packaged into one, so this review is for all 3 together. Total playtime ended up between 6-8 hours.\n\nThe art in this game is very comical and fits nicely with the sort of jokes in the game. It's high-quality with just a few spotty patches in the entire series. The voice acting in this is very good, with a wide range of 'british' accents, which help to add to the wide variety of amusing characters.\n\nThe humour, as mentioned, is very vulgar, so it won't be to everyones liking. It ranges from chav humour, to off-colour jokes about the local deadbeat population. Surprisingly, it manages to do so without resorting to a waterfall of swear words, with Hector showing off a wider vocabulary than you might initally expect, which really adds to the humour. There are also a few meta-jokes in there for good measure, which aren't too in-your-face.\n\nThe puzzles in this game are generally pretty good, with solutions that need you to think a bit, but aren't ridiculously complicated or out of the box. Its your standard p&c puzzles of helping out characters to get items to progress with others. There were one or two spots that left me stumped, but the in-game help is very good at giving both subtle and obvious hints at how to solve things. The way you can interact when you get to play as both lambert and hector at once is a nice way to spice things up.\n\nMy real complaint with this game is the interface. I never really got the hang of click once to view and click twice to interact, and often trying to double click just gets interpreted as a single click. Plus, on a 1080x1920 screen, the scenes sort of got squashed into a 1080x1400 letterboxed screen. A bit annoying. \n\nBut other than interface issues, this is a good p&c adventure game, and if you like a vulgar/british stereotype style of humour, then its definitely worth playing.", "timestamp_created": 1460836509, "timestamp_updated": 1460836509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21828861": {"recommendationid": "21828861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013735252", "num_games_owned": 620, "num_reviews": 180, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457929050}, "language": "english", "review": "Hector: Badge of Carnage is a hidden gem in the TellTale Adventure games.

The series tells a single story arching over the three episodes and therefore act as one in that sense as well.\n\nA terrorist is on loose at Clappers Wreake and it\u2019s your job as titular Hector to save the town. Very little is actually worth saving since the place is run down and infested with trash \u2013 both literal and as in its citizens. In your aid is an annoying and useless (the game\u2019s own words) sidekick called Lambert. Hector himself is no ordinary policeman and neither are his methods: There is not a single decent thing you do in this game! You have to insult people, drug people, cheat people. You\u2019ll participate in organ trading, church burning and evidence forging among other things. I especially liked the part where you beat up a dairy farmer.\n\nThis might seem as crude and you can be sure it is. It\u2019s all presented with loads of dark and tasteless humour that you either love or you hate. Every human orifice and fluids found within gets some time in the spotlight. I kind of liked the totally absurd conversation options and just listening to the madness. Puzzles are relatively easy and you can breeze through most of the game. There is a really generous hint system if you ever get stuck and even a full walkthough can be  found in the menus.\n\nGraphics have nothing to give praise for. Animation is there just to get the job done but it's not very polished. The game does support wide range of resolutions, at least up to 1920x1080, but the assets are not 16:9. Instead the game leaves black bars on both sides of the screen and it\u2019s really hard to tell any meaningful difference between the resolution settings. The graphical quality cannot be customised any other way. I didn\u2019t notice any crashing, bugs etc. during my playthrough, which took about 4 hours per episode.\n\nHector\u2019s voice acting really hits the spot and his delivery combined with the horrible things he\u2019s saying is what kept me motivated. Every character has a thick British accent with a lot of slang that is at times hard to understand. No matter, since every unfamiliar word is an insult anyway. Whatever other sounds or music there was didn't make any impact.\n\nI\u2019m a little bit ashamed to admit it but I laughed far more than anyone should at this game. I have given warnings about the content and if it still sounds like something you might enjoy, you\u2019ll get your moneys worth.

I made it maybe halfway through the first chapter/episode/adventure/whatever and just had no desire to suffer through the point and click gameplay to see the story pan out. I only briefly started the second iteration/sequel/whatever and it was just more of the same. The gameplay was by no means flawed and the art was actually rather marvelous, but Hector as a character just did not appeal to me.\n\n     Obviously I have no way to concisely convey all of my tastes in entertainment so I think my best advice would be to check out the trailers for the game, and maybe watch the first 10-15 minutes of gameplay on youtube. If you like the humor and the narrative then definitely pick up the trilogy when it goes on sale next. Otherwise, there are tons of other franchises out there to enjoy.

I was never disappointed with the responses I received from Hector when interacting with his environment and with others as the dialog is varied and entertaining.  I thought the puzzles were fairly easy, but Hector's partner, Lambert, was able to provide clues in a roundabout way had it been necessary.  There was even a hint option beyond that, unbelievably.\n\nHowever, the game isn't without it's flaws.  In fact, it suffers from a few glaring issues that make me just about want to not recommend this game and they both involve the voice dialog.\n\nFirstly, there only seems to be three or four voice actors for the entire game.  One voice sounds like an Asian making a pathetic attempt at a Brittish/Scottish accent and every time I heard this voice it grated on my nerves.  Secondly, some of the dialog has horrendous production value and sounds as if it were recorded with an extremely cheap desktop microphone with its gain set to max.  A third notable but much less irritating issue is that some of the text and voice didn't match and on a few occassions there was no voice at all.\n\nI would still recommend this game, but if I had to rate it I would probably give a 6/10.\n\nBTW, even though I chose to write a review for \"The Complete Series\", it's listed as a review of Episode 3 in my profile which lists as 4 hours played.

He's the right man for his place and time. Hector is a cop in the degenerate town of Clappers Wreake, a place which has so abandoned the notion of anything wholesome that the street out front of the police station itself features whores, drunks, and looting.\n\nAnd so the story is set in motion: a sniper appears in a window in town, gunning down police and boasting a roomful of hostages. Hector is called to the scene to deliver his unique brand of justice, only to be set on a series of errands for the mysterious gunman who claims only to have the betterment of Clappers Wreake at heart.\n\nHector is fat, blunt, rude, an alcoholic, and not a connoisseur of self-respect. He's every ounce as much of a degenerate as the rest of the population, but he's smarter than a good deal of them, and he's willing to do what it takes to save the day. For... well, some reason or other, anyways.\n\nHector: Badge of Carnage contains a lot of crude humor. The first screen of the first game involves fishing in a disgusting toilet with a used condom. But there's an interesting wit about it - particularly in Hector's observations on the situation. Yeah, this series is for the immature, through and through. But it's a sarcastic immaturity that's aware of its actions, and doesn't just settle for, \"Look, poop, ha ha!\" as an entire joke.\n\nThe voicework is not a highlight. The first game sounds as though it's voiced entirely by one guy speaking into his laptop's built-in microphone. The second game adds a genuine female voice to the cast, but that's still only two voices, seemingly digitally altered to sound more diverse. At the very least, the delivery's good, so it's nothing that'll ruin your experience.\n\nOn the whole, the puzzles are decent enough. The third game has a habit of making new elements appear in locations you've already visited, and then not alerting you to them, so that you have to stumble across them in a fit of random, confused wandering. But overall, I like Hector: Badge of Carnage.

I highly recommend playing this game if you love your point and click games, Its not long it should take about 3 - 4 hours tops (well for me) but was worth it.\nEnjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1353381101, "timestamp_updated": 1353381101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "3836690": {"recommendationid": "3836690", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027964687", "num_games_owned": 451, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1355040000}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Adventure divertido, no estilo cl\u00e1ssico, o humor bom, mas no geral, nada excepcional.", "timestamp_created": 1351910811, "timestamp_updated": 1351910811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "5613883": {"recommendationid": "5613883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052901030", "num_games_owned": 950, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Good guy Hector, solves mysteries and shit!", "timestamp_created": 1348853214, "timestamp_updated": 1348853214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "885107": {"recommendationid": "885107", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981027062", "num_games_owned": 9706, "num_reviews": 384, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\n\u3046\u30fc\u3093\u3001\u5fae\u5999\u306a\u30bb\u30f3\u30b9\n\u82f1\u8a9e\u308f\u304b\u3093\u306a\u3044\u3068\u304d\u3064\u3044\u3088\n\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u5185\u306b\u30d2\u30f3\u30c8\u3042\u308b\u304b\u3089\u653b\u7565\u306f\u7c21\u5358\n\u3042\u3068\u77ed\u3044\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1339145616, "timestamp_updated": 1385412550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460199", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "2550087": {"recommendationid": "2550087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009156904", "num_games_owned": 516, "num_reviews": 179, "playtime_forever": 148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1338706800}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, dirty and pretty good (althouh, IMO the dialogues aren't funny) and the game has unique settings (porn shop, strip bar and brothel in church, etc.).

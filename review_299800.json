You can get lost for hours playing the simple, yet still so complex and difficult, puzzle levels.  It uses a level hub that allows you to play and re-play levels in different orders so if you get stuck on one level you can always try another and come back later.  Each of these levels is a work of art in itself with the beautiful backdrops and the catchy background music.  However, the true glory of this game doesn't come from its pretty looks but rather its unique use of game Physics to enhance the puzzles.  The Land of Eyas uses a gravity-flipping center line to allow you to propel your character around the game board.  This allows levels with puzzles and solutions that your mind has never thought about before.  This creative concept gives a great feeling of satisfaction when you realize what you can jump off to slingshot yourself to the next goal.  The combination of the artwork, this cool gravity concept, and tight gameplay make this a must have game.  Not to mention the replayability that comes in because of the achievements and level times (Gotta get all perfect times!).

Your goal is to recover lost memories of a... boy in a cat suit. Yeah, you've read that right. Recover parts of your memory as you go through a bunch of mind-streching levels, where each of them have a twist - there are two gravities!

It's perfect to sit back with a controller in hands, hot coffe on a table and relax for a bit. Unless you're an overachiever in here, then have a great fun speedrunning all those levels and getting 100% of achievements, as The Land of Eyas is perfect for it. \n\nPersonal score\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th]\n9 / 10\n[/th]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[i]If you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow [b]Opium Pulses[/b] curator page right [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/OpiumPulsesNews#curation]here[/url] for more reviewed games![/i]", "timestamp_created": 1473952859, "timestamp_updated": 1476266491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575863", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25502382": {"recommendationid": "25502382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017381248", "num_games_owned": 1001, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473887674}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing Land of Eyas for a while, and have streamed it a buncha times in the past for good fun. Its a pretty solid patformer that uses the under-half of the game world as an inverse gravity field, which allows for puzzles that span large vertical spaces to make bigger and better puzzles. If you like the idea of ibb & obb but never have a second player, this game will do more than just scratch the gravity-inversion itch, but probably leave you wanting more!\n\nStorywise the game makes sense - a kid in giant onesie has to feed glaze-encrusted donuts to a very depressed talking tree. They both have trouble remembering stuff, and I kinda wonder if that inverse gravity layer isn't actually too healthy to be around. Then things start to get nasty when the mechanical gears come out too - there's a red room with a conveyor belt that forces players to use profanity to win. \n\nSeeing all the polish and quality build up and come to fruition has been quite satisfying, and I'm really glad to see the overall result come out so well.

But how do you know which way to go when you can\u2019t tell which is up and which is down?\n\nThat\u2019s the introduction to this game. The Land of Eyas is essentially a puzzle platform game. I\u2019ll be looking at it primarily from a casual gamer standpoint. Not that I\u2019m actually a casual gamer, but when it comes to platform games, I might as well be.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKvcpgNWV14\n\nLet\u2019s start first with the nitty-gritty. This is the stuff that any action game and any platform game has to get right or it\u2019s already a non-starter. \n\nHow\u2019s the response? I played with a keyboard. I think platformers are best done with a control pad, but if a game has good keyboard response, chances are it has got good response period. Eyas had good response. I\u2019m comparing this to the rather fussy issues I had when playing Rogue Legacy. I did find the jumping to be a bit \u201cfloaty\u201d feeling. As opposed to the \u201chard\u201d jump of the classic NES Super Mario Bros\u2014if anyone has even played that in the last decade. The sprinting and jumping had the typical response time challenges that I see common in many platformers though, regardless of who is playing them, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s as it\u2019s supposed to be. The type of platforming you\u2019ll do in this game necessitates the type of jump physics that are in the game. Prepare for multiple retries. Thankfully, longer levels have check points.\n\nHow\u2019s the performance? I had no frame rate drops on my mid-tier gaming PC. That said, I didn\u2019t get to test on any of the levels that had spinning saw blades, etc. But even so, I\u2019ve seen FPS drops in games on my PC that were less action oriented. So I call this a success as well.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9WjrKsTCZI\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got the non-starters cleared, how is the game itself? Well, you\u2019ll not find anything revolutionary here. It\u2019s an action puzzle platform game. That\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get. You\u2019re also going to get really beautiful artwork. And that\u2019s what drew me to this game. The boy in the cat suit (Eyas) is cleverly reminiscent of the boy in the white pajamas from Where the Wild Things Are. It\u2019s a savvy decision on the part of the art director. I instantly gravitate to it. The rest of the artwork is crisp, ornate, evocative, and disarming\u2014which is good when your game is a puzzle game and likely to provoke frustration (that\u2019s the nature of the beast). Anything to keep me wanting to look at the game is unequivocally good. I\u2019d almost like to say that artwork is the third rail of platform games these days. Without artwork, what is your platformer bringing to the table that the platformers before it have not already? That Land of Eyas is unapologetically beautiful.\n\nThis leads me to the next important aspect of the game: its gimmick. The gimmick is that the force of gravity reverses at the midline of each level. Later levels shake this up further, but this is the core conceit. It looks like a water line. You cross it. Suddenly you find yourself falling up instead of down. It\u2019s not bad as far as gimmicks go, but it\u2019s nothing we haven\u2019t seen before. Does it need to be? What is important is that it adds just enough flexibility to the game that it can present you with some unusual puzzles. So really, I shouldn\u2019t call it a gimmick. That implies that it brings nothing to the table. But it does. It makes you have to look carefully at what\u2019s on your screen to decipher the solution to each level. So really, it\u2019s a game mechanic and it works in favor of the game. Hopefully enough that you find the puzzles in this game to be ones you haven\u2019t seen before. For a casual gamer, I think it succeeds very well. \n\nThe story? Well, there\u2019s not a lot of story to interest me initially. You\u2019re a lost boy talking to a talking tree (yes, I meant to write it that way). You\u2019re looking for \u201cMother\u201d (Isaac anyone?). I won\u2019t say that I was drawn in instantly or anything. Perhaps as you progress you\u2019ll be more invested in the character(s). I wasn\u2019t. But frankly, I don\u2019t play games any more to read a story, certainly not platformers. Play this game for the puzzles. You won\u2019t be disappointed.\n\nAm I going to get 100\u2019s of hours out of this game? No. It\u2019s not a grand strategy game, is it? But what I will get is enjoyment for my time and a sense of accomplishment in nice bite-size brain packets. I need a nice low-stakes diversion from time to time and Eyas provides that. It even opens multiple levels to choose from so if you get stuck on one, you can solve another and give your brain a rest. This allows you to progress the game until you\u2019re ready for a fresh look at that one level you couldn\u2019t solve yesterday. Again, a very savvy development decision. It circumvents the banging-my-head-against-a-wall feeling many other linear platformers have.\n\nDo I have any criticisms of the game? Is there anything I did not like? Yes. I did get frustrated at times by the deadliness of spikes. Rubbing the side of a crystal doesn\u2019t strike me as an offense that should be punishable by death. I\u2019m not play 1001 Spikes, after all. Yes, that\u2019s a real game. The little \u201chop\u201d you make at the apex of a moving block was inconsistently implemented and therefore annoying. When you\u2019re riding the elevator block, you want to jump at its highest point. This is not possible though because you \u201chop\u201d when it gets to that highest point\u2026 except in cases when you don\u2019t. Which is it? I want consistency here (you can witness this in my gameplay videos if it isn\u2019t clear). The blocks that you can pick up and carry were a great introduction, but there was a 1 pixel exploit I found where a block was essentially hanging in the air. Not sure I want to complain about that one though considering how hard it was to get that block up there in the first place. None of these things stopped me from enjoying the game, though. I\u2019m a rather fickle gamer, also. So it\u2019s a solid testimony to the game\u2019s strengths that I didn\u2019t give up on its weaknesses.\n\nIn the end, I easily recommend this game to someone who wants something fun to do with their brain on a Sunday afternoon.", "timestamp_created": 1473623311, "timestamp_updated": 1473623311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.432025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25388549": {"recommendationid": "25388549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034700324", "num_games_owned": 1005, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477419971}, "language": "english", "review": "A great little puzzle platformer where you're a small child in a cat suit and a somewhat hidden story.

You play as a boy, Eyas, who wakes up in a cat suit in a strange world with no memory and a talking tree who may be able to help him. The game acts as a support group for people like me because I finally feel like someone understands me. Until this game, I thought I was the only person who constantly wakes up in a cat suit, talks to a tree, has difficulty telling which way is up and which way is down, and forgets about what happened the night before. But that all changed with The Land of Eyas. \n\nAs I briefly alluded to before, the unique game mechanic you'll see in The Land of Eyas is the two dimensions that exist in every level. There's this wavy horizontal line that represents the center of gravity, and your character is always pulled to it. So when you fall below it, it pulls you up, and when you're above it, it pulls you down. You'll have to find ways to use this mechanic to your advantage in every level if you hope to make progress in your adventure. This, alongside other game mechanics like building blocks, makes the game require you to take a moment and plot your way to the end of the level. It's not the kind of platformer where you simply make your way onwards - no. The Land of Eyas is a platformer where you'll have to think hard in order to complete the level as you would to solve a math problem. Just as soon as you think that you've mastered the use of the gravity horizon the game will throw more mechanics at you like saw blades and building blocks. You'll constantly have to adapt to these new mechanics in order to continue achieving success.\n\nAs if the game wasn't hard enough there are challenges you'll have to complete if you wish to experience everything the game has to offer. Remember that talking tree I mentioned earlier? Well, some levels have seer stones within them that you have to return to the tree in order for him to discover the truth behind his lost memories. These seer stones are often challenging to get and require you to really go out of your way and think even harder than you would to simply complete the level. The levels also display \"perfect\" times in the top right corner that you may attempt to match or beat, but I don't see any indication that the completion of these challenges in particular will unlock any kind of content.\n\nThe soundtrack and sounds in general are also very nice. The music is often fast paced, rushing you onwards and driving you to make mistakes, and sometimes it is mysterious, serving as a reminder of the strange world you've found yourself in. As for the sounds, there's something oddly satisfying about the \"thump\" you hear when your character lands. Similarly, there's something oddly disturbing about the sound you hear when your character perishes. The music and sounds within are fitting and add to the game wonderfully.\n\nThe art style is rather unique and it feels like there is more than one art style throughout the game. You can tell by looking through the screenshots on the Store Page that there are a plethora of different color palletes and environmental themes used throughout the game. There are bright levels, dark levels, cloudy levels, earthy levels, industrial levels...you get the point. Eyas's design is memorable yet it's also a direct copy and paste job of my cat suit. Shameful (/s).\n\nWeaknesses...I suppose it's a good thing that I have to think hard in order to come up with weaknesses. The story is [i]alright[/i] but ultimately I feel like it serves as a backdrop to the gameplay, rather than what urges you to push forward. I haven't completed the story, but at the same time I don't feel motivated whatsoever by it. I wish there were more NPCs to run into and speak with, but they are far and few between. I also wish the game could make me care more about the story in the first place. I really don't care how Eyas got to where he is to be honest, just as I don't really care how and why I wake up in a cat suit occasionally. The only thing motivating me is the challenge of completing all of the levels. I also think you should be able to zoom out whenever you'd like, instead of it doing it automatically at certain points within the level. Furthermore, I wish checkpoints were slightly more plentiful (or better positioned) in some levels, but that's probably just me.\n\nI'm very, very picky when it comes to platformers. I hate the ones that provide an artifical amount of difficulty. I hate the ones where you constantly die and get teleported back to the beginning. That shit gives me motion sickness. But I like The Land of Eyas - I really do. It has a charm and uniqueness about it that I'm drawn to. I like the music in it and I like the freshness each level presents. I never feel like it's getting repetitive as some platformers tend to. I haven't completed the game yet but I certainly plan to, just because I want to see what other game mechanics will be thrown at me. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys platformers. I see and appreciate the hard work that was put into this game and I wish the developer the best of luck.\n\n[u][b] TL;DR[/b][/u] The Land of Eyas is a charming, challenging game with a touch of mystery. It's unique gameplay and unique world come together to create a memorable experience. While the story falls short, you'll be encouraged to complete the game simply to overcome the challenges it presents. \n\n[u][b] MachoDan's Bottom Line:[/b][/u] The Land of Eyas gets a 75% or 'C' Rating\n\n(A+) Hot and bothered\n(A) Bother\n(B) Bother as soon as it\u2019s on sale \n[u][b] (C) Bother only if you like the genre\t[/b][/u]\n(D) Bother only if you really like the genre\n(E) Don\u2019t bother\n(F) Bother your state representatives with a letter complaining about the existence of this game \n\n--\nThanks for taking the time to read my review!

In fact, I'm particularly happy that RSG picked up this title - there are a lot of interesting titles in RSG's catalogue.\n\nPlatformers count amongst one of my most favourite game genres. I've absolutely adored games like [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/k3w3l/recommended/40800/][i]Super Meat Boy[/i][/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/k3w3l/recommended/238460/][i]BattleBlock Theater[/i][/url], and I definitely feel this game would fill a similar market to those looking for similar games.\n\nYou play as the titular character, Eyas, on a journey to find his home. Eyas is this incredibly cute boy in a cat suit, quite adorable. In fact, all of the art assets made here are impeccable - somewhat easy on the eyes, yet at the same time exuding a certain quality and charm to it. [strike]It's kind of a pity that this game does not have trading cards/backgrounds (yet?) as those could definitely be used to showcase some of the artist's more favourite works.[/strike] They've been recently added.\n\nThe soundtrack is orchestrated brilliantly as well. Good use of various instruments and song selection for each level stage, with particularly more difficult levels being accompanied by slightly more frantic, yet never overpowering, songs.\n\nAs for the levels - they form the bread and butter of the game, and the level design is superb. A good amount of precision platforming and lateral thinking is required to solve the brunt of the levels - some require measured movement while others require well-placed jumps from specific locations. The somewhat unique gravity flipping mechanic comes into play a lot as, for example, you have to ascertain which level you have to jump off from the top side, in order to be able to land at the correct platform after you flip gravity.\n\nI only really have one major gripe about this game, and it's somewhat personal, but - the platforming isn't precise enough for my liking. Unlike most platformers Eyas does not run at full speed whenever he moves, all the time - but instead he has to (somewhat more realistically, I'll admit at least) speed up from 0. I think others shouldn't have much of a problem with it though. It's just that I really demand a lot of precision when it comes to controls, and I often find it easy to move too much in one direction than I intended to.\n\nUltimately, I really like this platformer game and, again, feel that fans of the other two games I mentioned above would definitely take to this one as well.\n\n[h1]When to buy[/h1]\nIn all honesty, for the amount of levels present in the game, I thought it would have been priced at $15.

There was one map where you literally needed to slingshot your body across the entire [strike] fking\t[/strike] map, surprising satisfying(and frustrating, que: retries 10 times) once u get it. You play as a cute kid trying to get home and to do that, u got to find seer stones to feed it to the mask guy and go home (oversimplification). \n\nThe game is a combination of super meatball and floating point. First few levels teach you the basics of the game. The difficulty pushes it up a couple of notch after. First up kudos to the dev, the levels are well thought of and are [b][i]really intricate [/i]\t[/b]. One good tip from my experience is to [b]avoid[/b] using your up or down key. It\u2019s almost never needed and only serves to confuse you more. Controls are clutch however you do need to predict your character movements when facing obstacle (saws, blocks), you might want to press keys in taps instead of one continuous press, think less is more. Music is very subtle which is a huge plus because it does not annoy you when you die for the ten times. \n\nThe game is a very good production by Happy Square Production, however I might add that I feel there is a somewhat lack of story narrative in the game(could be because i havent gone far into the game yet). [b]  Overall this is a very good game. 9/10. \t[/b]\n\n[spoiler] Edit: I discovered that I\u2019m Buddha, because you need Buddha tier patience.

En revanche, apr\u00e8s quelques heures pass\u00e9es sur le jeu, on finit vite par se lasser de cette musique assez r\u00e9p\u00e9titive. Seule une variation de musique est disponible pour le menu principal et ne se d\u00e9bloque qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin (th\u00e9orique) du jeu.

The game manages to have this unique atmosphere that makes the matches that much more compelling.\n\nEven unlocking things in this game is a blast, with stuff getting unlocked just from playing multiplayer matches like in smash bros. That's not the reason why unlocking the stages is fun though - it's the unique animations that play. For example, a piece of the moon in the background of one stage falls off, which then crashes down to earth on the map screen and BECOMES another stage! A very hype moment indeed! After that, the piece of the moon will be missing in the background of the original stage. It's attention to detail like this that make TowerFall that little bit better than other indie local multiplayer games. All these little quirks, and yet the gameplay doesn't suffer at all. You can tell a lot of love went into this game.\n\nIf you like having friends round for a night of gaming on the couch, then buying this is a no-brainer.

You can beat the campaign, and the expansion's levels, but the campaign was never designed as the main attraction. Towerfall is meant to be played against your friends, side by side, on the couch. The campagn provides a challenge to complete with your friends, a sort of distraction from beating each other up, and a place to earn more stages and characters, but the real joy is  in the arena. \n\nThe awards at the end of each match are hilarious, and pages of gameplay modifiers add to the depth.

The outcome of  a match in a game with  a skill celing is no longer based on the player's skill but other lucky or unlucky elements.

And finding a marvel in the pile of shovelware is always nice, even though it's an extremely rare happening. As you might've guessed already, this one is one of the good ones.\n\nSo, basic gameplay is simple: you choose a hero, you enter a level, you shoot baddies with your bow. You have a lot to unlock, though -- new levels (each with new enemies), new difficulties, new challenges, new heroes even. Depth of the game is one it's main perks, honestly.\n\nAnother great side of Towerfall is the gameplay, of course -- fast paced action all around (speeding up even further on higher difficulties), it's as fun as it gets, especially if you're playing with a friend.\n\nAll in all, I would rate this game 8.5 out of 10 and would definitely recommend it to people who enjoys great pixel art, fast-paced platformers and casual archery.

It has been the most fun game I've played with friends out of the countless games we've tried. TowerFall kept us ingaged, entertained, and Challenged for over 4 hours. The only down side is that there isn't that many levels. We finished all the co-op levels in 4.3 hours on regular difficulty. With that there is multiple ways to make the levels more challenging including adding curses to your characters (de-buffs) and harder difficulties. The controls are very tight and confortable. The movement is very fluid and makes the gameplay that much more enjoyable. There is many unique systems in the game that add depth and take to master and perfect, Example: Dodging through projectiles or Holding Dodge to catch enemy projectiles to name a few. The games pixel art is good and even though the game plays in a square resolution no one seemed to mind or notice.  The Music isn't anything special in my opinion but it's good and does it's job. The Friendly Fire mechanic presents many memorable moments and funny conflicts between friends/team-mates. Finally the combat is exquisite. It's very fun to take down the many challenging enemies. You can try and pull off a shot or you can risk getting close and try the classic head smash. It's also very fun to go for unique shots or trick shots with different kinds of arrows (Bomb/Super Bomb, Drill, Reflecting, Etc.).

Its single player mode is tacked on and hollow (much like many modern games). I cannot recommend it if you're looking for a good single player experience. However, its incredible multiplayer more than justifies the game's reasonable asking price if you have a few controllers. While the Dark World expansion fleshes out the campaign, it is still best enjoyed when you have a few friends to share in the rage. One MAJOR caveat: the game has no online multiplayer. While the reasoning is understandable, (the game has mechanics timed down to individual frames and would be a subpar experience if there's any amount of latency involved) I believe having a poor online mode would still be superior to not having one at all.\n\nBarring those few criticisms, Towerfall Ascension is a gem of a local multiplayer brawler. You play as one of several archers (that vary only cosmetically) and have a limited number of arrows (3 by default). Once you shoot an arrow, it is left on the world and you must pick it up by walking over it. Your movement and aiming is combined into a single control, which takes some getting used to if you're new to the genre. You are only able to move and aim in 8 principle directions. The arrows you shoot home slightly if there's an enemy in range, and there are multiple arrow types that range from exploding to bouncing to piercing. Each attack is an instant kill, regardless of whether it was through shooting your opponent with an arrow, hitting them with an arrow's secondary effect, or stomping their heads in. There is also dodging, which is both your defense and mobility ability. And finally, there is screen wrap, where the top/bottom and left/right of the screen are connected.\n\nIt was designed from the ground up to be played locally, and accommodates both casual and competitive play. The default game mode on headhunter is perfect for people who have never played the game, with just enough rubber-banding to keep everyone in the game without being egregious (nothing like Mario Kart's first to worst from a single blue shell). Each round is paced well, and no one ever stays hopeless or dead for too long. You can go down the list of maps to gradually introduce your friends to new items, and never really overwhelm them (unless you want to).\n\nIf you're playing casually with experienced players, custom game modes vastly increase the replayability of an already replayable game. Small tweaks like spawning with special arrows or returning as ghosts result in significant changes in how you play. And finally, making an asymmetric custom mode (2v1/3v1 team death match) where one player gets huge bonuses (such as regenerating shields and arrows) while the opposing team gets an advantage in numbers is almost like playing an entirely new game. Even the more chaotic game modes (like infinite drill arrows or infinite laser arrows) are good for a round or two before you abandon them and pretend they never existed.\n\nAnd finally, the game is very well balanced competitively. Dodge cancelling and superjumping are difficult mechanics to master, and yield a surprisingly high skill ceiling. While there are a few oddities for a competitive game (bolt arrows finding your opponent's home from 3 zipcodes away, kicking their dog, then brutally murdering them right in the face comes to mind) it's nothing that custom rules can't fix. Because everyone has the same attacks and abilities, the only thing that sets players apart is their positioning, skill, and reflexes. \n\nTowerfall Ascension is an amazing game that I highly recommend if and only if you play local multiplayer games. Do not buy this game if you're looking for a single player game or a good story (mediocre and nonexistent respectively). However, Towerfall Ascension is one of the best local multiplayer games out there.

Os movimentos tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o simples, pulo, pulo na parede e desviar, e segredo \u00e9 saber quando us\u00e1-los, um pulo na hora errada pode te tornar um belo cad\u00e1ver, lembrando que se voc\u00ea usa o movimento de desviar, que basicamente \u00e9 um das para o lado que voc\u00ea estiver direcionando o personagem, e uma flecha te acerta durante o movimento voc\u00ea pega essa flecha para voc\u00ea. Basicamente esse \u00e9 um jogo de agilidade, habilidade, estrat\u00e9gia e muitas vezes de sorte, muita sorte.\n\nAs partidas s\u00e3o extremamente r\u00e1pidas e din\u00e2micas, em menos de cinco minutos geralmente se decide um mata-mata de 4 jogadores de 5 rounds, e \u00e9 nessa dinamicidade que o jogo se torna rapidamente um v\u00edcio, j\u00e1 que voc\u00ea sempre fica com aquele sentimento de \u201cS\u00f3 mais uma! Agora com certeza eu vou acertar!\u201d. O jogo tamb\u00e9m tem o modo co-op e na expans\u00e3o TowerFall Dark World s\u00e3o adicionados boss nas fases de co-op, basicamente esse jogo tem divers\u00e3o para todo tipo de pessoa. Eu recomendo extremamente que voc\u00ea corra atr\u00e1s e jogue!\n\nUma coisa que eu n\u00e3o podia deixar de falar \u00e9 a arte pixelada desse jogo! Mano, essa arte \u2665! O jogo tem esse estilo \u201clow pixel\u201d como se fosse um jogo bem antigo, mas a din\u00e2mica das anima\u00e7\u00f5es e os detalhes de ilumina\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o feitos de forma que contrastem com o estilo simplificado dos sprites fazendo uma composi\u00e7\u00e3o incr\u00edvel! Tem um detalhe em espec\u00edfico que eu vibro toda vez que eu vejo, que \u00e9 quando a flecha passa perto da cabe\u00e7a do personagem e o chap\u00e9u do seu personagem cai! Eu sei que \u00e9 um detalhe que n\u00e3o muda em nada o jogo, mas eu acho isso incr\u00edvel!\n\nResumindo, esse \u00e9 um jogo que eu recomendo para TODAS as pessoas, o \u00fanico ponto fraco do jogo \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m o ponto forte dele, j\u00e1 que n\u00e3o existe multiplayer online, apenas local.

I wish it did, but also respect the developer's opinion that the number of variables he can't control (lag, disconnects, etc) would harm the quality of an incredibly well-controlled twitch game.\n\nThe level of detail in the art, sound, and overall design is just astounding. The controls are surprisingly simple to pick up and play, we've had Towerfall as a regular party game for years now and have seen newbies and non-gamers (even ones usually shy about games) pick up the controller without hesitation and do impressively well. And yet this ease of entry doesn't detract one bit from the skill ceiling: if you're ready for the next level there are plenty of techniques to escalate to for high-level play including dodge cancels, frame-perfect grabs and of course HYPER JUMPS!\n\nIf you fancy yourself pretty good at the game the competitive scene is worth taking a look at.

Controls default are move, jump, shoot, and dodge.  Shoot your opponents or jump on their heads to kill them.  You can catch arrows by dodging at the right time.\n[*]Different weapons and powerups (Bomb arrows, bolt arrows, etc) make play very interesting.  There is abundance, and everything has a use.\n[*]The pac-man style looping of the levels is awesome.  Shoot through the left site to hit the right side, fall through the bottom to get to the top.\n[*]Good handicapping for the players in the lead/behind.  If you're in the lead you get less arrows at start.  If you're last you get a free shield.  This levels the field and makes games fun for both beginners and veterans.\n[*]Lots of options, virtually everything can be toggled.\n[*]Cheat codes exist to unlock everything, in case you don't ever want to play this single-player.\n[*]Your friends will rage at you when you catch all of the arrows then proceed to stomp on their heads instead of shooting them.\n[*]Arrows have a very slight tracking, if the initial shot is close enough.  This takes the thought out of whether or not you should shoot.\n[*]DLC has enough new stuff to justify the price, but is absolutely not required to have fun.\n[*]Game is damn fun.\n[*]There are hilarious awards given at the win screen based on how you and your opponents played.  I think I got a \"bomb squad\" award for catching bomb arrows, or \"super booper\" for jumping on a lot of heads.\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Negatives:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Single player campaign is overly hard.  Thankfully all levels/characters can be unlocked by a cheat code.  I have a feeling that if you can play through the single player most of your friends will not want to play with you because you'll become \"too good\".\n[*]Versus becomes better the more players you have.  2 player is meh, 3 player is above-average, 4 player is insane fun.\n[*]No internet multi-player.   This especially hurts if you have multiple friends that own this game and want to keep unlocks in sync without resorting to the cheat code.\n[*]Some of the stuff to do the level/character unlocks is insanely hard.\n[*]Playing without a controller is a bad idea.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1475224295, "timestamp_updated": 1475224295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25715371": {"recommendationid": "25715371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109873421", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 11282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520546995}, "language": "french", "review": "Je ne comprend pas pourquoi ce jeu n'est pas plus populaire, pour moi il est juste l\u00e9gendaire et totalement indispensable, de plus, il est le seul jeu qui m'ai fait acheter un DLC sans que je le regrette un minime instant, un exploit quand meme.

Its crazy how it got us all jumping and screaming for the entire time we were playing. I remember getting this in a indiebox and thinking \"meh what a crappy game for this month\". But being able to finally play it with a full group finally made it worthwhile. \n\nThe gameplay is fun and hectic. You get only a single life per round. Each round lasts anywhere from a handful of seconds to usually no longer then a minute. So players aren't left on the sidelines too long if they die in the very first second making a dumb move. Every arena is randomly generated and are usually very well balanced.  Every exit on the level links directly to the corrosponding opposite side. So that opens up a world of crazy encounters with groups that know how to use them creativly. The powerups add a whole level of craziness with the level moving vertically or horizontally. Which can disoritente some players and give others the chance to move in for a kill. Depending on who is winning and losing the game adds simple handicaps that gives others a chance to win even if they have lost a lot of rounds back to back. Some of the handicaps simply add a sheild allowing you to withstand a extra strike or helps bend your arrows to make it easier to strike a oppoent down. While leaders will have fewer arrows to start and most use pure skill to outwit their oppoents handicaps. It sounds like it make it unfair. But for me after all my years of multiplayer gaming.

It doesn't look like it's remotely worth it's price at first look, or even necessarily at the first bit of playing.  But the boss design is AMAZING, the music is tight, and in general it's a real fun game.  The hardest levels/bosses on the hardest modes are extremely challenging, but well designed.  It sits on the cusp of what feels like artificial difficulty at times (as if certain attacks/events cannot be avoided), but then with practice you learn that even the hardest attacks or enemies are avoidable with enough skill.  The difficulty curve is also well designed in my opinion.\n\nFunnily enough, I got almost nothing out of the versus multiplayer mode.  It's fine, I guess.

While colliding with the enemy causes you to die, booping on enemies (even players in a versus match) has been a method proven by magical plumbers everywhere as the best method of elimination.\n- Running out of arrows. Have I told you this game is all about arrows? Shooting arrows, picking up stray arrows from walls, dodging AND grabbing arrows out of the air (the mystical tower archery training paid off). You will always find amusement in arrows flying everywhere and people trying to aim at little pixelated sprites with only 8 possible directions and a brilliant projectile physics...until you get shot in the face, of course.\n\nHowever, glorious, hilarious deaths will certainly be caused by:\n- DIfferent arrows that comes in form of a powerup from a loot chest. Be it explosions, bounces of walls, floor hazard generation, there's arrows to suit every kind of your archery needs.\n- Flavourful enemies, some only spawn in certain levels. Be it the nearly-harmless slime, pestering ghosts, and dark hooded figures with pointy tools that can deflect your shots, it's better to end them before they end you.\n- Getting shot in the face by a wily foe on versus mode\n- Getting shot in the back by a sneaky foe on versus mode\n- Getting shot in the back by an ally on co-op mode\n- Shooting an arrow up, missing that goddamn bird and watch as the arrow plunge down right to your own character\n- Lava. I mean, if Matt Thorson made a platformer game without floor hazards, people would flip.\n- Getting shot in the face by your own bouncy arrow.\n- Getting shot in the face by someone else's bouncy arrow.\n- Trying to play single-string guitar with your bow...with Cursed Bow mod turned on.\n- Getting divebombed from above (read: booped), Super Mario style.\n- Failing dodge.\n- Succeeding dodge and still get shot.\n- Succeeding dodge, stole their bouncy arrow, tries to shoot them and ends up bouncing it at a wall and back to one's face.\n- And many more.\n\nIt has huge replayability value when you play at couch coop with your friends. Done co-op on normal mode? Go hardcore. Done versus on normal mode? Turn on random mods and have a good laugh (or ruin your friendship). I wish they would expand on the story by adding narration and further the coop campaign, but I think that's what the Dark World expansion is for (I haven't checked). I have played coop with my brother and it has been such a blast that I wish the players can immerse further by adding background stories or certain triggers.\n\nI highly recommend this for: \n- Fans of MattMakesGames' old platformer games like Runman, Jumper and Untitled Story (that one with the birdthing).\n- Those who are looking for a great couch coop game, playable sober or drunk.\n- Fans of mechanically-challenging games. The platformer, jumping of walls, all the while trying to aim an arrow will be a great experience for you.\n- Fans of great pixel arts and detailed, fleshed out game assets.", "timestamp_created": 1467683707, "timestamp_updated": 1467683707, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24092461": {"recommendationid": "24092461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130604623", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518922602}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "melhor jogo pra jogar com a galera no sof\u00e1... sem mais", "timestamp_created": 1467664972, "timestamp_updated": 1467664972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24077700": {"recommendationid": "24077700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038224768", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512840154}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Excelente jogo, principalmente para jogar em co-op", "timestamp_created": 1467631515, "timestamp_updated": 1467631515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24074125": {"recommendationid": "24074125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088375710", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465715530}, "language": "english", "review": "Great fun for living room local play!", "timestamp_created": 1467620936, "timestamp_updated": 1467620936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24065287": {"recommendationid": "24065287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027043815", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520315805}, "language": "english", "review": "Really really REALLY \n\n\ngood", "timestamp_created": 1467590559, "timestamp_updated": 1479924362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24011695": {"recommendationid": "24011695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086950186", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519986297}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing!", "timestamp_created": 1467455045, "timestamp_updated": 1467455045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24001474": {"recommendationid": "24001474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054591045", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447094916}, "language": "english", "review": "Controller required to unlock all content.", "timestamp_created": 1467420471, "timestamp_updated": 1467420471, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458601", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23914280": {"recommendationid": "23914280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129330741", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500049198}, "language": "english", "review": "friend 2-3 player with hard mode recommend\nThis game remind me old family console game.", "timestamp_created": 1467173645, "timestamp_updated": 1467173843, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23902627": {"recommendationid": "23902627", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999053231", "num_games_owned": 334, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498962650}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best couch multiplayer games I've ever played.

The graphics aren't too hot either, but given the recent 8-bit retro style trend in many indie games, I can more or less let that slide.  The sound track was okay.    \n\nIt's a multiplayer game which can *only* be played through local co-op/VS mode.  In theory, that shouldn't count negatively for it.  Realistically though, how often do you and your friends have time to get together and play a local co-op game?

Sure, different arrows and other powerups keep it fresh, but the core design is so strong - playing without any powerups in a simple map doesn't get boring after the 5000th round. Adding to the variety are the modifiers in Versus mode, which just adds to the number of hilarious deaths.\n\nBut make no mistake - multiplayer is very competitive with the *right* opponents (and this is one reason which may put off people - there is no online multiplayer). The game is a good example of easy to get into, hard to master. I'm fortunate enough to have friends who're also into this game, so I've had some pretty tough competition to level up.\n\nThe Quests are where Towerfall is at its weakest, but the weakest sections are still pretty strong. The game technically isn't long - if you're good at the game it'll barely take you 4 minutes per level to beat it in Normal without retries. The length, however, comes from the retries. But really, the feeling of beating Ascension in Hardcore mode after the 400th try is priceless.\n\nI'm a bit conflicted about the Dark World expansion though. It's definitely a good expansion, adding 4 new characters and (effectively) 4 single player quests with a restructuring of how quests are played (different arenas as opposed to different rounds in the same arena in the original) - but I'm not sure whether that justifies the price. Multiplayer is almost the same, just with more maps and characters (and since there are no character-specific abilities, that doesn't mean much).\n\nSo basically, main game - must buy. Expansion - should buy.", "timestamp_created": 1451537028, "timestamp_updated": 1479984405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20137984": {"recommendationid": "20137984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157429169", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451716508}, "language": "english", "review": "I ask the producers who understand it and there are people who simply do not have friends or friends '' who like video games '' I just I can not use the large coop mode. and apparently I will not play online too\n\n\nEu pe\u00e7o aos produtores que entendem que e existem pessoas que simplesmente n\u00e3o tem amigos ou amigos '' que gostem de video-game '' eu simplesmente n\u00e3o poderei usar o grande modo coop.   e pelo visto eu n\u00e3o vou jogar online tamb\u00e9m", "timestamp_created": 1451536235, "timestamp_updated": 1451540640, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20135378": {"recommendationid": "20135378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130992220", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497822601}, "language": "english", "review": "This is probably the best multiplayer game I've ever played in my life.

Well gather around and I shall tell you a story about Dungeons and Dragons... On second thought I will just tell you about Towerfall.\n\nStory: If you are looking for an enriching story, look somewhere else. You won't find it here. There is a story, but its all spoiled by the trailer on this page.\n\nGraphics: If you are looking for the next generation of graphics, you definitely won't find it here. But you probably already know that since you probably watched the trailer that spoiled the story. Good artstyle though. \n\nGameplay: If you like zipping through levels at high speed with no second thought whatsoever, then you will almost immediately die. This game requires a lot of thought and skill. Sometimes you will lose visibility of your character since there are going to be some split second decisions. LET ME STRESS THIS: YOU WILL DIE A LOT!\n\nBIG CRITICISM I HAVE (NOTICE THE CAPS): THIS GAME HAS NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER. TOWERFALL IS BASICALLY ASKING TO HAVE AN ONLINE COMPONENT TO IT. I FOUND MYSELF ON THE LAST LEVEL THINKING I NEED SOME HELP TO GET THROUGH THIS. BUT WILL I EVER FIND THE HELP THAT I NEED? NOPE! (I DON'T SEE MY FRIENDS TO OFTEN, SO I CAN'T EXACTLY PLAY LOCAL MULTIPLAYER.) VERSUS MODE NEEDS ONLINE MULTIPLAYER. BIG OPPORTUNITY MISSED.\nTHE TIME TRIAL MODE IS ANOTHER THING THAT I HAVE BEEF WITH. THE TIME TRIALS AREN'T REALLY FUN AT ALL. THERE IS NOTHING REDEEMING ABOUT THEM. ONCE YOU GET DONE WITH IT, YOU WILL PROBABLY NEVER GO BACK TO IT. THIS COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN FIXED WITH A online (lowercase for emphasis) LEADERBOARD. MAKING IT A COMPETITION TO GET ONE OF THE FASTEST TIMES WOULD HAVE MADE IT A TON BETTER AND WOULD HAVE CAUGHT MY EYE A LITTLE MORE.\nTHE CHARACTERS ARE THE SAME. THERE IS NO DIFFERING QUALITIES THAT MAKE THE CHARACTERS UNIQUE ASIDE FROM THEIR NAMES AND COSTUMES. THEY ALL PLAY THE SAME AND THEY ALL USE A BOW AND ARROW. I THINK THAT THIS GAME WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE INTERESTING IF THERE WERE DIFFERING WEAPONS AND PLAYSTYLES FOR EACH CHARACTER. IT WOULD HAVE EASILY BEEFED UP THE REPLAY VALUE IN THIS GAME. INSTEAD, I FOUND MYSELF USING WHICH EVER CHARACTER I LANDED ON AFTER I CLOSED MY EYES AND COUNTED TO 5 AS I SCROLLED THROUGH ALL THE CHARACTERS. THE GAMEPLAY IS SO REPETITIVE (but it is fun) THAT CHOOSING A DIFFERENT CHARACTER DOESN'T REALLY MATTER. I THINK THE ONLY REASON WHY THEY ADDED ALL THESE CHARACTERS IS BECAUSE OF THE VERSUS MODE. A MODE WHICH THEY FORGOT TO PUT online IN.\n\nFinal Verdict: If you like repetitive gameplay, no depth in story or characters, no online multiplayer, a game mode that doesn't have any redeeming qualities whatsoever, and a game that you will pay $15 for and will last you about 3 hours just to do the main campaign, then this is the perfect game for you.\nBut seriously this game is by no means bad. The gameplay is top notch and will last you a lot more than 3 hours. The replay value is definitely there, but it could have been a game I could have gotten extremely addicted to if it added all the things I said. THIS GAME COULD HAVE DEFINITELY BENEFITTED FROM HAVING online MULTIPLAYER. If you have friends and you see them a lot, then this game will most likely be perfect for you guys. \n\nAND IF THE DEVELOPERS EVER SEE THIS REVIEW, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY, ADD online!", "timestamp_created": 1449290435, "timestamp_updated": 1449376895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19490161": {"recommendationid": "19490161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198172749375", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480040543}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Fighter\\Areana game ever.

There is no online multiplayer whatsoever.[/b]\n\nSpectacular battle arena-type game focused on fast-paced bow and arrow oriented combat, with mechanics that are very approachable and, for the most part, easy to figure out on your own. The relative transparency of its mechanics does not, however, mean that it is an easy game to master, with its tight controls, twitch counterplay mechanics, and well-crafted, deceptive arenas. A notable feature is the added dimension of screen wrapping - players or objects that pass through the bottom of the screen will come out through the top, left side through the right, and vice versa. Should you decide to pick the game up, you will soon discover what a devilish thing this can be.\n\nThe game is split into three modes: Versus, Co-op, and Trials. The Versus mode pits 2-4 players against one another in one of three different sub-modes, all focused on killing the opposing players, with a large number of game modifiers available that change the games in a variety of ways. There are a large number of stages available, some of which have to be unlocked through various means. Co-op mode (perhaps more aptly called \"Quest mode\", as it can be played and enjoyed perfectly well as a solo experience) is a mode that pits you and a friend (up to three friends in the expansion's version of co-op) against waves of different enemies on each of the themed maps. There's not much more to it than that, but it is enjoyable and provides for some challenge if you're going for achievements. Lastly, Trials is a time trial mode that challenges you to destroy a number of dummies as quickly as possible with the tools available in each stage. It's somewhat maddening, but engrossing for the obsessive.\n\nOverall there is little about the game that I can fault. The most notable flaw is its lack of online multiplayer, the exclusion of which may well have been intentional, as the game appears to have been constructed to strongly encourage getting together and duking it out with a group of friends. Even so, I would recommend it as a singleplayer game due to its inherent charm and the challenges it provides in its Quest and Trial modes, although I imagine a lot of people would disagree with me on this point. I'm just a sucker for a good challenge wrapped into a neat little package.

The character designs are unique and likeable. Many clever unlockables such as characters and stages. The music is fantastic and memorable, I occasionally get the random songs stuck in my head.

This game was released in March 2014, after initially being released as an Ouya exclusive in 2013 (snarf). It is now on PC, PS4 and Mac/Linux.\n\nTowerFall's arena type gameplay focuses heavily on archery. The game has two modes; firstly the single player - the aim is to kill targets around each stage either by stomping on their heads, or by shooting them with your bow before a timer runs out; this leaves to plenty of replaying of levels in order to better your score and to beat your best time. \n\nWhere TowerFall really shines is in the multiplayer mode. Up to four players will fight in a battle royal environment. Your aim is simple, kill or be killed. Each player has a limited amount of arrows to do it in too, so you can't just spam fire and hope you get lucky. You are able to replenish your ammo by picking up rogue arrows shot by yourself and the others though, meaning things can get very frantic. Throughout the stage, there will also be various different power-ups spawn, such as special effects on your arrows or shields - these all add to the extremely fast paced gameplay. \n\nThe graphics and art style, yet again have the pixelated theme, but they are still all really well drawn out and it looks very pleasant. Each of the arenas that you are fighting in also look amazing too, some will be set in the jungle, others in a poorly lit cave, they all look gorgeous. \n\nSingle player in TowerFall Ascension is easy; you can easily clear the stages in less than an hour. Where the difficulty ramps up like most games is the multiplayer. It will only be as difficult as your opponents are, as they are they only thing that can kill you; you don't need to worry about the environment playing tricks against you.  It will take you a few hours to get to a point where you are competent in games; it can be very frustrating though. \n\nI have been playing TowerFall for almost eight hours now; I would say that this is a game to play in small chunks. Bring it out when you have friends over for an hour of almost archery style Super Smash Bro fun, but any more than that, and you may find yourself getting a little bored.  This is certainly a game to keep installed due to the replay-ability though. \n\nThe game supports resolutions up to 1080P, which I suppose is all you need for a pixel style game like this and it is highly recommended you play this game with a game pad; keyboard controls would be a nightmare. \n\nTo conclude, I am going to simply recommend TowerFall Ascension; its a game that not everyone will enjoy, and is almost certainly made with couch multiplayer in mind. If you don't have friends who also own this game, don't get it, the single player is not worth it. If you can find a group to play with, sure its worth the \u00a310,99 because of the fun fast paced gameplay you'll get out of it. \n\n\n[b][u] Tom's Score Card[/u][/b]\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n[b][u]3) Recommended[/u][/b]\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It's just good fun. The controls are tight and responsive, the mechanics are the perfect blend of \"easy to learn, hard to master.\" Multiplayer is the most fun you can have outside of Smash (and if you ask me it's just the most fun, period), though as part of the \"couch multiplayer\" revival it features no online mode, so bear that in mind. The art design is spectacular, and just goes to show that pixel art is not only alive and well but more vibrant and beautiful than ever. The score is a mix of crunchy, punchy chiptunes and eclectic orchestral/folk sounds, giving each stage a one-of-a-kind atmosphere. Between the timed Trials and 1-2 player Quest mode, several difficulty levels and insane challenges, crafty unlockable characters, and the aforementioned barrel of fun that is the multiplayer, there's plenty of content to keep you busy; and the latest Dark World expansion only multiplies the replay value.

My family is playing it constantly, every day. I also find it quite fun to play through co-op levels as a solo player.\n\nOne word of warning: the game is a bit pricey just by itself, but to really get the most out of it you'll very likely want the expansion. The expansion's features are fully integrated into the core game, but if  you try to use them it'll tell you you have to buy the DLC. :-p\n\nWithout the expansion, you can only play co-op with 2 players, each of whom has a fixed number of lives. The expansion adds co-op levels for up to 4 players, but there's no lives store - if a player dies, another player has to revive him, and if all players are dead the game's over (continuing is possible). These worlds can also be played solo mode with fixed lives, and unlike the core game worlds you can continue if you die on a particular level.\n\nThe versus mode is quite fun, and does a great job of balancing skill levels without dampening the fun (if you're winning, you get fewer arrows, and if you're way behind you start with a shield). The number of interesting outcomes for a battle seems quite high, and I find myself saving replay GIFs regularly. Neat little details abound, such as the way you can knock someone's hood or hat off if your arrow merely brushes through their hair instead of hitting them squarely.

I have seen veteran gamers and people who don't play games both get hooked on Towerfall after playing just a few rounds. It is that accessible and easy to get into. But that's not to say that it's easy - it'll take countless hours of gameplay to understand the subtle tactics which will allow you to compete at high levels of play.\n\nThe art style and presentation of the game is beautiful and nostalgic to anyone who grew up with games from the SNES era in the 1990's. There is no online multiplayer but the developer has explained why many times: the game is too fast to facilitate satisfying and fair online gameplay. With that said, you will want to be playing this with friends locally because that's the way that it's meant to be played.\n\nRecent updates to Towerfall have brought so much value to the game. I recommend getting the Dark World expansion pack, even more so now that it adds Steam Workshop support. Not only is there a whole new world of user-generated Towerfall content to enjoy, but the way that all of this new content is integrated into the game is brilliant.\n\nIf I could only have one local multiplayer game on Steam, I would probably choose Towerfall.

The first night I got it, I played with one friend. Then two. Then we get all four of us playing. By the end of the night we all needed a cup of tea because we'd been screaming at the screen and each other and having a great time. \n\nThe co-op is completely customizable. It's hilarious how much you can screw with the game by dictating starting gear or setting changes. My absolute favorite is to include ghosts so that when you die, you're a ghost trying to get out other players. Also? There's three different multiplayer modes--head hunter, last man standing, and team deathmatch. \n\nThe single player is why I avoided the game at first. I'd seen a review saying that the single player was terrible. And actually, it's not bad. It can be single, or you can have your friends help you through the campaign. I couldn't imagine beating it alone because it's hard with just me and a partner, but I'm sure it's doable. There isn't a *ton* of content, but it's enough to have a good time, for sure. We're almost done with normal mode all through the campaign (on the last level of the expansion) but then we'll have to go back through on hardcore. \nWhat really makes the levels interesting is the bosses. They're cleverly difficult and there's a different way to beat each one.\n\nFinally, the expansion is great. It unlocks some cute aesthetic changes and adds another five or so levels of gameplay to the campaign. So whether or not it's enough content to typically warrant a $10 purchase, we wanted it so bad we bought it anyway. \n\nAll in all, it's been a great investment!

It has beautiful, polished pixel art and a game mechanic that never gets old. The controls are very easy to get used to (assuming you are comfortable using a controller in the first place) and feel intuitive and responsive. However, the game is not even the best part. The best part is your friends. A lot of people have complained about the lack of Online multiplayer, but I completely support the developer and long for games that bring back the good old \"local multiplayer games\" days. AAA games are very sophisticated and everything, but no game (not even TF2!) can give you the fun that you get from having your friends right by your side; Trash talking, High five-ing, howling in frustration and what not. Even writing about this makes me want to play more Towerfall :D\nIt's so great that it has even displaced Fifa 15 as \"The game to play\" with my friends :D\nTrust me, it may look like I have only a few hours with this game, but I've played this game for nights on end with my friends (offline so it didn't really record it...) and I can assure you we're not going to put this down anytime soon. This definitely is among the greats, even better than the Worms series or anything else that comes to mind at the moment. It's a must buy whether you're just a school-going kid, a college student, or even a total grown up; Because all you need for this game is a bunch of controllers and your best friends! You don't have to put hours into the game because it's really easy to pick up and all the stages are unlockable just by playing versus mode too -- which is a very exciting thing when it happens -- and so you can even sneak in a few rounds during your break (something I do very often :D)\n[Ofcourse, it is best if you hook your laptop up to your TV so that you aren't all crowded around a tiny screen :) ]\nThe Darkfall DLC is also totally worth the price -- It adds a whole lot of powerups to the game and really changes the way you would play it. To end, I can't stress how amazing this game is and how me and my friends spend most of our time talking about Dodge cancelling, or some amazing kill that we had the night before.

There really aren't many alternatives when it comes to Steam party games. I suppose if you're someone with a Steambox who is just realizing Half Life 2 and Sakura Spirits do not make for very good party games, it may be worth the investment. Otherwise, just bust out the Gamecube.  Play some smash bros. \n\nI'm not saying the game isn't a unique experience. The archery is fun, but it has its problems.  In Co-Op/Singleplayer you can only shoot in 8 directions, and your arrows will curve slightly towards any enemy. On a couple occasions I was trying to shoot something directly above me. So I shot up, but the arrow curved  towards a closer enemy who was above and to the left. It missed him then tried to curve and hit my original target. Ended up missing both stationary enemies.\n\nPlaying alone is not very fun. Thats alright, most party games aren't meant to be played solo. A lack of Online really sucks. Some website named Polygon even wrote an article on why you don't want Online in this game. Which was all I saw when googling if there would ever be online. I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the dev told them to write that so Steam reviews would stop complaining about it. An easy fix would be to add a LAN mode.  Normal people are forced to play the way the dev intended it.  But those who live out in the middle of nowhere can still use Hamachi to play with a friend.\n\n[spoiler]There was also going to be a map editor but the $10 dlc was of greater priority.[/spoiler] Make your own conclusion on whether you want to support that or not.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1432145614, "timestamp_updated": 1432145614, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484817", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15917239": {"recommendationid": "15917239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075296453", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489433922}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u041e\u0413\u041e\u041d\u042c!!!\n10 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0437 10!", "timestamp_created": 1432144697, "timestamp_updated": 1432144697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15908748": {"recommendationid": "15908748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044122038", "num_games_owned": 425, "num_reviews": 157, "playtime_forever": 1206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515872648}, "language": "english", "review": "This game does not do online multiplayer, only local.

The controls are excellent.[/b] Only a few buttons, yet there is [i]sooo much difference[/i] between being skilled at it, which requires a fairly complete understanding of the system, and being \u2018meh\u2019. It seems simple at the start, where you are clunkily platforming around the levels (at the time you think its just fine), until you start learning how to 'dodge-cancel' and soon enough you will be flying around in a way you would have previously thought impossible.\n\n[b]2. All the action takes place on a single screen.[/b] This allows for purely awesome couch co-op or versus. [i]TowerFall[/i] revels in how simple it [i]feels[/i], but yet has many layers of complexity that it rolls back as you dig in.\n\n[b]3.

[i]I even had friends playing this that would never touch a platformer.[/i] I mean it was complex enough for a serious gamer, yet could draw in newbs. Tons of mode customization as well, and lots of cool trophy unlocks (tons actually) and statistics that keep me coming back for more.\n\n[b]Caveat:[/b] the only  deal-breaker for this game, is that you must have controllers, and you must have friends willing to come over and sit on the couch to play local. If you don\u2019t have this, go elsewhere. Single player is really fun since I look at it as training, but other than that, I would not recommend just for single player experience.\n\n[b]I could go on and on, but at the end of the day \u2013 I am hooked.[/b] I think my friends may be hooked as well.

I've cleared all stages on Legendary without continues. Going to try for no death runs next.\n\nI love everything about it. I've mostly only played solo but I'm glad there's 4 player co-op now. My only request would be that the two campains are merged allowing for 4 player in the Ascension Quest. The problem would be unifying the difficulty system and reseting everyones achievements so I can see why it wasn't done, I still think it would be a nice addition.\n\nI don't miss the scoring system. All the stages have an achievement for clearing the highest difficulty with no deaths, this being the highest achievement pretty much made the scoring superfluous. Additionally the game now tracks fastest times which I think is a much more easily understood and meaningful measure of skill. Speed runners rejoice! The Dark World campaign isn't overly long and be cleared on the easier difficulty in around an hour, but those who enjoyed playing for gold skulls in the Ascension Quest will get a lot out of playing for the harder achievements.\n\nPrism arrows I think are designed to affect high level competitive play, where no one misses a dodge catch, in which case it makes a significant change to the meta game. Trigger arrows are fun but damn is it easy to SD with. There is such a huge number of arrow varieties now that adding more might start to subtract from what makes each arrow interesting, as well as increasing the barrier of entry for newcomers. Haven't had a chance to play much versus yet but the Dark World content should make a great addition.\n\nAlso love the additional Trials stages. It's a part of the game I didn't expect myself to take so much pleasure in, but once you start aiming for the red pearl dev times the mode becomes a kind of rewarding puzzle game, though it does play havoc on my RSI and I fear my controller will crumble in my hands before I ever clear them all.\n\nAll in all I love every bit of TowerFall and can't wait to see what Matt works on next, TowerFall or otherwise.", "timestamp_created": 1431835699, "timestamp_updated": 1431835699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15864490": {"recommendationid": "15864490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060737517", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480110908}, "language": "english", "review": "Great and fun little game.

Overall, the game is extremely well polished. The graphics, sound effects, and game mechanics are outstanding. Multiplayer is really where this game shines. Up to four archers battling for chaotic supremacy. There's different \"variations\" of gameplay to choose from when playing multiplayer which really help mix it up when the stock gameplay becomes boring.\n\nThe somewhat crappy part about multiplayer though is that you have to unlock new stages and archers by playing the single player (or duo) \"quest\" mode. This is where things take a downward slope.\n\nThe difficulty is way over the top. Each mob has it's own unique abilities, which is great, but the AI is possibly the worst I've ever seen. Normally when people say \"the worst\" they mean dumb or too easy. TowerFall is the exact opposite. The AI doesn't really do anything 'on its own', it simply reacts to the user's input. Sure, there's some \"dumb\" enemies like goos or slugs that walk around the map and occasionally jump at the player but most of the mobs react as soon as the player it's the dodge, jump, or fire action. Like for example the second I press fire, the enemy archer dodges. Every-single-time. Like wise with certain flying mobs. The second I fire an arrow, they dodge. They will always dodge it. Likewise when they fire an arrow. If you dodge, they will fire a second arrow. If you jump, they will reaim and fire another arrow, hitting you everytime. The only way I've found to effectively kill an enemy archer is to unleash a barrage of at least 3 arrows. It's exceptionally stupid.\n\nThat being said, I think this is a really fun multiplayer game. While you have to unlock all the features through single player \"quest\" mode where you'll have to deal with the abysmal AI, the mutiplayer aspect is s great that I can ignore that.", "timestamp_created": 1412056376, "timestamp_updated": 1412133179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12292606": {"recommendationid": "12292606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033676254", "num_games_owned": 574, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492109021}, "language": "english", "review": "year of the bow", "timestamp_created": 1412018549, "timestamp_updated": 1412018549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12289962": {"recommendationid": "12289962", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970709250", "num_games_owned": 2817, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505030519}, "language": "english", "review": "An amazing fast paced brawler for up to four local players.

These will spawn at the beginning of each match. Some power ups give you special arrows (laser arrows or bomb arrows for example), others will have an environmental influence (slow motion or rising lava). These power-ups are always a great risk to get, because you have to engage, but the reward can be big of course. \n\nOn the other hand there's the tactic to avoid shooting. You start with three or two arrows and when your opponent shoot and miss, you can grab that arrow. But of course, once again, these missed arrows can also be used as a trick.

It's addictive, very quick and easy to pick up, and is fun to play alone or with up to three other people.\n\nThe initial design and look of the game is surprisingly intricate considering the 2D pixel graphics. The characters have absolutely no difference in combat style or stats, but you still find yourself drawn to them and interpretting personalities purely in the way the sprites move with certain commands. This most definitely also applies to later on when more characters are unlocked. The levels themselves - which randomise every time - also look gorgeous and I'll find myself playing the same couple over and over simply due to how visually interesting they are.\n\nThe combat style comes incredibly naturally. I've seen friends play for both days or only a couple of hours each and still have very good grips on the game, which is handy when it comes to playing versus mode. The stand and shoot style is simple enough and gets the job done, but even after you think you've discovered how to fight in every way possible, there'll be another trick or move you didn't realise existed and it'll add a whole new dimension to combat. It may look simple, but there are countless different strategies and styles of fighting, and that's before the countless types of arrows and pickups come into play - of which there is a strong and interesting variety.\n\nQuest mode, if you power through, can only take a day to complete. This is before completing all the challenges and more difficult settings, so if this is the only mode you're interested in or perhaps have no one to play versus with, it may not be worth the money. However, quest mode can still be done 3x each level if you're aiming for a higher reward each time, which gets many more hours out of the game. Time trials are also possible to explore and present a real challenge; I found them much more difficult than the other modes. But that may simply be because I'm not a fan of time-pressure modes and if you aren't either, this whole section may be pointless for you.\n\nVersus is a huge positive point for this game. It is fun with two people but is definitely more fun with 3-4. Even if you master quest mode, that's usually due to memorising the characteristics and attack patterns of the enemies; which isn't possible in versus. Considering it doesn't take long to get decent at the combat system, it's immediately a fun challenge and fights can go on for literally a couple of seconds or drag out until the time is over. Even though I've completed the game this is definitely a feature I will keep returning to play. This for the most part is what made the game worth my money. The only downside I will note is that it is only local multiplayer, whereas online isn't a feature. You'll have to physically endure your friend's company. Sucks, I know. Another good point to versus, however, is that it's the key to unlocking plenty of achievements both within the game and on Steam, so if you're a completionist you'll be spending plenty of time exploring this mode. There are also lots of variants you can toggle on and off (for example, coming back as ghosts to claim your revenge, which is a great one), which adds a new twist to gaming if you get bored of doing the same thing. This, along with different scoring settings, gives versus a huge variety of options and gameplay styles to experiment with.\n\nAll in all, I'd absolutely recommend this game. If you're more of a casual gamer and can't see yourself pumping that many hours into it, I'd say maybe wait for it to go on sale otherwise you may view it as a bit overpriced. Otherwise, the game has tons of choice and variety, lots of secrets to unlock, and makes you feel like you're an archery master in no time.

Developed primarily with local multiplayer in mind, it reminds me of playing Goldeneye for the N64 with friends when I was younger. Towerfall makes me wish local multiplayer wasn\u2019t something almost forgotten in today\u2019s industry. If you have the local player-base, the game combines a competitive atmosphere, zany gameplay, and retro graphics to create a great experience.\n\nThe aesthetics of Towerfall are very good. The graphics in the game are done in a modern pixel art style. The sound design applies simple sound effects and a solid soundtrack to ensure the game is appealing from an audio perspective. I think it is a good example of marrying sound, graphics, and style so the sum is greater than the whole. This unification gives Towerfall a unique personality.\n\nThis personality spills into the character and level design. The various archers feel different, despite having no actual gameplay difference or dialogue. I feel each character was given a persona purely by their title and appearance. The levels are well done and provide a good variety of environments. Each level has different layout and graphics. I felt most levels were thematically different and allowed for different strategies to be applied. Enemy design and aesthetics are also cohesive with each level. Some levels contain specific enemies that further drive the theme of each level. Many monsters have unique behavior and weaknesses, making them feel believable and different. There are some enemy re-skins and reuse, but overall the variety is enough.\n\nThere are 3 main modes in Towerfall: quest, multiplayer, and trials. Quest mode is a single player/co-op mode that I found myself primarily playing. In this mode, you go through the various levels of the game defeating waves of monsters. This mode is decent for learning the game and features a \u201chardcore\u201d difficulty, but I didn\u2019t feel the need to play through it again. Trials mode is similar to the target run in Super Smash Bros. This mode was fun to play through once but like the quest mode, I personally wouldn\u2019t go back. Overall I found the single player modes somewhat boring. I only really found myself playing through the levels to just see the new enemies and gather some unlockables.\n\nThe game is marketed at couch multiplayer and the arena is where the designer\u2019s dream is realized. It allows 2-4 people to test their skills and has a full array of options to modify the game such as changing win conditions, items available, and level variables. There is even a system to give losing or inexperienced players a handicap. The mode is well polished and is something I can see playing on game nights for a long time.\n\nThe actual gameplay is what makes Towerfall great. It is crisp and simple enough for anyone to learn. Characters can simply only shoot arrows, move, jump, and dash. Compounding upon these basic actions, the designer added more features to enhance gameplay. For example, the arrows have slight homing properties. This allows players to not have completely accurate aim(which can be hard with only 8 way aim) but still be competitive. There are also a lot of various power ups. Things like shields, bomb arrows, wings, and drill arrows all work to create dynamic scenarios and open up strategic options. I found myself starting to focus on one type of power up to fit my play style. This all comes together to give a strong sense of flow. I always felt like a badass, dodging two arrows, catching the third, and firing it midair for a kill. Win or lose the gameplay is fast, fun, and furious.\n\nMy praise for the game is overshadowed a bit by some things though. The controls and movement system take a bit of getting used too. I was pretty frustrated until I learned the nuances. As I said above, the single player content is somewhat boring. Maybe leaderboards or something could have helped. This game hinges on being able to play with friends, without others the experience is extremely short. This is a game I\u2019d highly recommend everyone to try out. I\u2019d only warrant a purchase if multiplayer sessions could be set up.\n\nPlay if you:\n    - Like games that are easy to learn but hard to master.\n    - Reminisce about local gameplay.\n    - Want to dive into a theme that is whimsical and fun.\n\nPass if you:\n    - Don\u2019t have friends to play the game with.\n    - Are tired of the pixel art look in indie games.\n    - Prefer games with a story or more developed single player mode.\n\nMy recommendation: Pass. The game is great, but I can\u2019t really recommend buying unless you have the friends to play with.\nScore: 7/10.\n\nFollow me: \n\nTwitter: twitter.com/Tyrrexx\n\nTumblr: tyrrexx.tumblr.com\n\nFollow the developer here: twitter.com/MattThorson", "timestamp_created": 1409503977, "timestamp_updated": 1409503977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11915539": {"recommendationid": "11915539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086952457", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 947, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474689681}, "language": "english", "review": "TowerFall Ascension is an absolutely brilliant game.

My friends and I have literally been brought to cacophony because our epic battle was like two fireflies dancing in the sky... firing arrows at each other.\n\nIf you have friends, controllers, and flinch when someone says \"that game's new?

Flederm\u00e4use, Skelette, Magier, und viele andere.\nDoch fast allen ist mit einem Pfeil oder einem Kopfsprung zu Leibe zu r\u00fccken.\nDabei stehen Anfangs vier Helden zur Auswahl. Weitere sind (teilweise sehr kompliziert) freischaltbar, zeigen aber leider keine k\u00e4mpferischen Unterschiede.\nDie Anschauliche Karte bietet insgesamt 14 Level mit je drei Schwierigkeitsgraden, wobei der dritte erst freigeschaltet werden muss. Gleiches gilt auch f\u00fcr einige Level.\nEine Handlung ist dabei nicht zu erkennen, dies st\u00f6rt aber keineswegs.\nSo k\u00e4mpft man sich mit einigen Leben durch bis zu zehn Gegnerwellen. Dabei ist jeder Treffer t\u00f6dlich. Ein Pfeil durchbohrt eine Fledermaus und trifft euren Komplizen? Hoppla!\nDoch im Tumult passieren noch allerlei andere witzige Missgeschicke.\n\nHat man genug vom Monster verkloppen, bietet der Versus Modus eine spa\u00dfige Alternative.\nSpa\u00dfig deshalb, weil sich hier erst das komplette Potential des Spiels zeigt. Neue Pfeilarten, verschiedene Regeln und viele weitere Dinge k\u00f6nnen selbst konfiguriert werden.\nAllerdings macht dieser Modus tats\u00e4chlich erst zu dritt oder viert wirklich Laune.\n\nF\u00fcr die Stunden Alleine gibt es noch einen weiteren Modus. Der Trials Modus.\nHier gilt es in diversen Leveln verschiedene Aufgaben zu erf\u00fcllen.\nInteressant ist das, da einige Level Geheimnisse in sich bergen. Doch ansonsten ist keine Langzeit-Motivation gegeben. Das Spiel lebt eben doch von seinen Multiplayermodi.\n\nTowerFall Ascension bietet einen hohen Schwierigkeitsgrad, verschenkt aber Potential durch fehlende Abwechslung im Questmodus. Eine neue Art Anzugreifen, mehr Flexibilit\u00e4t in den Modi (es gibt in jeden Level Gegnerwellen und nur ein Level, in dem Gegner durch einen Z\u00e4hler runter gez\u00e4hlt werden), verschiedene Bosse und noch mehr Pfeilarten h\u00e4tten hier sicher gut getan.\nZudem w\u00e4re es ohne L\u00f6sung extrem schwierig gewesen neue Charaktere und Level frei zu schalten. Einige Tipps oder Hinweise fehlen hier.\nAn der Grafik ist nichts aus zu setzen. Es ist eben ein auf alt getrimmtes, stimmiges 2D Spiel.\n\nDoch gerade zu zweit, zu dritt oder gar zu viert vergisst man diese Negativpunkte. \nDann erwartet euch ein schweres und spa\u00dfiges Spiel mit einem hohen Suchtfaktor. \u201eNoch ne Runde, los wir schaffen das!\u201c h\u00f6rt man immer wieder wenn es mal nicht klappt.\nAlso auf geht\u2019s ihr Bogensch\u00fctzen!!", "timestamp_created": 1406583351, "timestamp_updated": 1406583502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11448882": {"recommendationid": "11448882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003961295", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422060402}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a lot of charm in addition to the likelhiood of becoming quickly addictive.

Then I got 3 friends over and boy was I wrong!\n\nThe pace can be frantic and down right insane at times. Trying to take out one opponent when another is hot on your tail can make for some intense matches. Nothing can beat the yelling that goes on when one person misses with an arrow only to be taken out by the person they were attacking. Or watching a one-on-one match from the sidelines and shouting for who you want to win.\n\nThe variety in this game is truely astounding, and frankly, something I wasn't expecting. The variants you can add to the match (such as laser arrows that never go away until they hit a person or another arrow, or corpses that can explode on command) really add a layer of depth that a game like this benefits from. The fact that you can save up to three pre-set variation packs makes these options work extremely well. So you don't have to go into the variants menu every time and select each modifier one-by-one, you can just save your favorite to a pre-set and reload it whenever you want to use it. The group I play with use this every time we play and it is wonderful.\n\nThe single player (Quest Mode) starts off more slow-paced than its multiplayer conuterpart, but does not stay there for long. The boss fights (yes, there are boss fights) take on a whole new level of gameplay and test your skills learned thusfar. The ability to play the \"Quest Mode\" with a second player really helps on  the more difficult matches, and I was only able to defeat the last level with a friend helping me. It really is a value add for something that could have been a multiplayer only experience.\n\nThe trials were something I never really got into. I'm sure they are fine, but I'm not a big fan of trying to speedrun stuff like that so I can't speak much on it.\n\nLastly, the hidden unlockable characters add a nice incentive to try the other game modes. There are four characters and I believe the same number of levels that can be unlocked in various ways. Each character has their own unique look. I would highly suggest getting all of these, as they are not too difficult to find and unlock.\n\nAll in all, this game is insanely good.

(particularly Melee) and the 8-bit Kid Icarus as far as gameplay and singleplayer campaign goes. Each part is more noticable depending on whether you're playing multiplayer or campaign. And, let it be known, this was the game that, alongside Bombsquad, led me to purchasing an Ouya.\n\nIt's upgraded appearance on the PS4 and on Steam are very much welcomed by me, though I have some qualms for the Steam version.\n\nThe PC is, unless you hook it up to the TV, not built for local multiplayer couch parties in mind. Overall, the PC mainly focuses on online multiplayer with the likes of Quake, TF2, and League of Legends. Towerfall does not have online multiplayer, and though arguments have been made supporting its non-support (and I agree with most of them), you essentially have to get things hooked up and working properly to get a decent couch multiplayer experience with Towerfall. Best thing I will say is that the Singleplayer is a bit easier on the PC.\n\nBecause, in my opinion, playing Towerfall with friends on the couch is THE best way to play it, I vastly prefer the Ouya and PS4 versions to the PC version. And, aside from these minor qualms, I think that Towerfall is one of the better combat-platformer (combatformer?) games on the market, outside of Super Smash Bros. itself. If you do not have a PS4 and want to play your PS4 game with friends, Towerfall alone is a solid reason to buy one, though at this point it's somewhat difficult to truly recommend it (hard to say with all these games getting delayed), but if you don't have one and do not intend to buy PS4 or Ouya, get it on Steam. If you have an Ouya, you need Towerfall. If you have a PS4, I will instantly recommend Towerfall Ascension. It's that good of a combatformer game.\n\nPros: VERY Solid gameplay, neat character design (My favorite's the Thief), a unique concept that by all means may be a steep learning curve (1-hit KO on most attacks) but ends up being easy to pick up anyway. Great soundtrack, and interesting take on the pixel art aspect.\n\nCons: If you're not familiar with the game, you may get steamrolled by other experienced players. The music, while still great, can get repetitive in the campaign. PC version is, by design of PC, hard to get that multiplayer experience without online multiplayer built-in (which is why I recommend the PS4 and Ouya versions over the PC version, at least for now). Ouya version was what got me hooked on Towerfall, but last I checked did not get the Ascension version that PS4 and PC had.\n\nOverall: 9.5/10 for PC and Ouya, 10/10 for PS4.", "timestamp_created": 1405752570, "timestamp_updated": 1405752570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11294376": {"recommendationid": "11294376", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038567255", "num_games_owned": 384, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459387976}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my answer to a different flavor of Samurai Gunn.

A true pixel master slow-roasted these graphics to perfection and it shows in every frame.  Everything is so incredibly individual, it really makes this game stand out in a sea of sadly imagined \"pixel-art\".  Details like arrows catching fire and archers hats and cloaks being shot off to reveal their little faces can be so easily overlooked in the overall beauty of the environments and the chaos within them.\n\nThe sound is absolutely amazing. The soundtrack is so fitting and the sound effects are so thoughtful and beautifully mastered.  Just hearing the title music gives me goosebumps, and the sound effects are so amazingly original.  The sound really makes the game pop and it really showcases the individuality that this game posseses.  I cannot stress enough how it seems that audio has been put on the backburner in games for so long and almost lost as an art, yet Towerfall is spilling over with so many incredible tracks and sounds.  Not just sounds, but video game stuff.  Stuff that doesn't fit anywhere but on a screen in front of a controller, and it's heaven to my ears.\n\nBeyond just these athstetic properties, the game, although simple, is a masterpiece full of replayability.  As one of many (unlockables!) archers, you can battle against challenging evil NPC creatures alone or with a friend in Quest Mode, or cross arrows with up to 3 other human rivals in the furious Versus Mode.  There's also a Trials section where a single player can race the clock with skillful displays of archery.  As you would expect, the Versus mode is very customizeable, making for many many types of multiplayer battles.  There are currently 75 variants to tweak and the developer has been adding more since release.  And since the game isn't incredibly complex, there's not a lot of room for bugs or glitches to occur.  The game runs flawlessly 100% of the time and doesn't require a massive gaming rig.\n\nThere are some interesting ways that the game lets you unlock new areas and fighters.  Perhaps this one thing was the reason I felt so attached to this game.  Unlocking secrets can be so squeelingly exciteable that it makes this old gamer feel like a kid again.  In an age of DLC and dollar unlockables, this title still has the ability to make a digital unlock feel earned.  Without giving too much information away, one of the final(?) unlockable sequences requires a pretty immersive association with the game, which felt very clever and rewarding.\n\nAlthough, this game may not be for everyone.  The fast-paced mechanics and 'twitch' control style could potentially be a barrier for a lot of inexperienced gamers.  There's no online mode, so if you don't have a lot of couch buddies, the replayability level might not be as high.  The Trials section of the game does offer a heap of challenge though, so if you're only 1p you won't be left out cold.  The keyboard is just no way to play this game though, so you'll need at least one controller to really enjoy it, and if you don't have a set of controllers for a few other players, I'd immagine the fun would be dulled a bit.   That said, if you enjoy a challenge, or challenging your friends, this incredible title will have you and your buddies hooked.\n\nGFX: 10/10\nAUDIO: 10/10\nGAMEPLAY: 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1403306725, "timestamp_updated": 1403306725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530572", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10578821": {"recommendationid": "10578821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066156159", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416010631}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great local multiplayer experience.", "timestamp_created": 1403292338, "timestamp_updated": 1403292338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10568138": {"recommendationid": "10568138", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996834152", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519467327}, "language": "english", "review": "An incredible local multiplayer game!

With added Mac and Linux support (that I have not tested yet), its over the top awesome. I strongly recommend this to anyone interested.\n\nTwo important caveats. First, it is a versus game at its core and offline only. If you aren't ever going to be playing couch co-op with friend or at LAN parties, you lose a lot of the value. Even just one v one is super fun. You can keep it interesting for a long time with all the different varients. Second, controllers are basically necessary.

Towerfall: Ascension works equally well as a competetive experience and a casual party game--a feat not acheived since, arguably, Super Smash Bros. Melee.\n\nFor the uninitiated: Towerfall: Ascension is a two-dimensional, single-screen, local-only multplayer game in which two to four players attempt to be the last person standing by launching volleys of arrows and squishing heads like an Italian plumber on a small mushroom creature. The mechanics are simple--providing you controls for moving, shooting, jumping, and dodging alone--but offer a level of depth I have barely begun to penetrate.\n\nIf you want to really shake things up, though; Towerfall offers a crazy amount of variants, all of which can be combined in any configuration. Want infinite arrows? Got it. Exploding corpses? Got that, too. Exploding corpses that trigger on command of the deceased? Oh yeah, it's got that.\n\nTowerfall does offer single or multplayer Quest and Trials mode, which are very fun in their own right, and can be crazy addicting if you're looking to master the game, but the real meat and potatoes is in the competitive multplayer. So, if you don't have many friends to play with IRL, or enough controllers to acommodate them, give this one a pass, but if you want to relive the days of your childhood when you had your friends over to play Smash Bros., Goldeneye, MarioKart, et al, you cannot afford to miss this game.\n\nDo I recommend it?

And I don't think I've laughed and screamed at the TV with any game this much outside of Smash. Towerfall is a fast paced brawler/platformer/shooter game. It guess it kind of defies genre classification. I suppose you could file it under party game? It plays best multiplayer, that's for sure.\n\nTowerfall is kind of like Smash, except every hit is a one hit kill. And the levels wrap around Pac-Man style. And every player has projectiles. So I guess not really like Smash then, but it's similarly as fun. It's easy to pick up and play, the only buttons are jump, shoot and dodge. Moving your character around and learning the game is quick and easy, but like any good game, there's a deceptive amount of depth. You don't always want to shoot when your opponent is expecting you to because then he will dodge and catch your arrow. You also don't want to mindlessly fire away arrows at your opponent because ammo is limited and your opponent can pick up any stray arrows that miss and fall on the ground. You also have to be mindful of opponents that get up close to you as jumping on an enemy's head is also a one hit kill.  You also have to be aware of the edges of the screen and remember that the level wraps around. It's possible to get easy kills on unaware opponents by shooting back across the screen at an enemy on the other half of the level or jump down the bottom of the stage to head stomp somebody on top\n\nThere are also powerups that appear throughout the match that can give you arrows that explode on impact, bounce off walls or cut through the stage. Matches are quick, usually averaging about 30 seconds per round, so you'll want to race to pick up powerups as you see them. There are also powerups that can grant you invisibility, flight or trigger arena traps to try to kill your opponents. There's usually a lot happening on screen all at once and matches can get a little hectic, but I mean that in the best way possible. At the end of each round, there's an instant replay system that shows the final kill of the game. This is actually a pretty cool feature because things often happen so quickly that you'll miss how someone died. There's also a good variety of levels that have different powerups, different layouts and different terrain. You can also randomize the rules of Towerfall each round for maximum ridiculousness. One of my favorites was playing under a rule that doesn't show you how many arrows you have left combined with another rule that instantly kills you if you try to fire an arrow when you have no ammo left. The amount of customization and variety in Towerfall is a huge plus\n\nAs stated before, Towerfall definitely plays best with friends. The single player is alright for what it is I suppose, but if you're buying Towerfall, you're getting it to play with other people. Towerfall supports up to 4 simultaneous players and I found that 4 seemed to maximize the fun, hilarity and craziness of the games. Towerfall doesn't support online play of any kind which is really unfortunate because I think a game like this could really be fun online. At the same time though, this game is really fun to share with other people in the same room, yelling, laughing and screaming at the TV and at each other. I wouldn't be surprised to hear that this game eventually gets some sort of online support though, I would imagine that's going to be an often-requested feature. The only other thing that might be limiting this game is the hardware. This game plays best with 4 people. I happen to have 4 USB controllers for my PC, but I'm pretty sure I'm in the minority. And I don't think a whole lot of other people have 4 Ouya controllers or 4 PS4 controllers lying around either.\n\nBut if you've heard the positive buzz about this game, it's true. Believe the hype. This game is well designed, fun and fast paced. It's the early leading candidate for my 2014 game of the year. Yes, I know this technically came out last year on the Ouya. But now it's out on platforms that people actually widely own and use, so I hope this game gets lots of exposure in the near future. Check it out if you want a good, fun party game to share with friends\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/", "timestamp_created": 1396235311, "timestamp_updated": 1444574185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9680973": {"recommendationid": "9680973", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993326080", "num_games_owned": 1233, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1399609627}, "language": "english", "review": "In the same vein as Super Crate Box.

It needs to reward skill, but have an element of luck as well.  It has to allow for incredible comebacks and crushing losses.  TowerFall Ascension does all this and more.  It has quite a retro feel, set up for a 4:3 screen and with SNES-era graphics.  It also has a ton of customizable options, great level variety, a really nice replay set-up for final round kills, works great with Xbox 360 controllers... I could go on and on, but I won't.  \n\nThis game has that \"thing\" that makes you say \"one more round...\" about 30 times before you actually turn it off.\n\nThere are two drawbacks that came immediately to mind.\n\nOne, couch multiplayer only.  Not a problem if you have friends, controllers, and your PC is set up for gaming.  Not great if you typically play games at a desk on a monitor.  This isn't much of a single player game, so this is going to limit its audience, which is really unfortunate.\n\nTwo, per the store page, minimum specs for integrated GPU solutions call for Intel HD 4400, which I believe starts with 2013 Haswell chips.  I don't really get that at all.  Intel HD 4000 is able to run The Darkness II or Bulletstorm on medium settings at 720p at 30FPS.  How on earth this game would be so poorly optimized as to not run on that chipset is beyond me.  Note that in fairness, I haven't actually tried it yet, so who knows, it may run.  I just find it bizarre.  As a comparison, games in a somewhat similar space like Nidhogg and Samurai Gunn run flawlessly on an Intel HD 4000 chipset.\n\nEDIT:  Haven't tested multiplayer yet but the quest campaign mode ran flawlessly on my Surface Pro.  Inten HD 4000 probably runs this game fine.\n\nOutside of that, I'd give this game my strongest possible recommendation.

One of the main reasons I could not recommend this game at all on release was that, as far as I knew, it was not possible to unlock all single-player content without multiplayer modes (versus), which requires an extra controller.  As this is NOT the case, I can recommend this game if it is on sale (50% off or more, and it has been 75% off previously) and you look up the code.  If it matters, you will still need to fufill normal unlock conditions for achievements.\n\nThe game still sorely needs an online mode, has no AI for versus, and is not quite a pick-up and play title.  The two times I've returned to this game after a long absence, it has taken me a while to relearn the controls, an issue I don't frequently have with other games.  This may not be a problem if you play often enough, or with a controller.\n\nMy outdated review can be seen below\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you can gather 1 to 3 people for local multiplayer, then feel free to buy this game.\n\nHowever, if you plan to play this game by yourself, make sure you have a spare controller before purchasing this game.\n\nWhy?  Because even with a keyboard, a controller is required to play Versus mode, and certain content (at least 3 map sets and all 4 extra characters) can not be unlocked unless you can access Versus mode.\n\nIf you do not have a controller, you will not be able to unlock all single player content.\nIf you do not have a controller, you will not be able to unlock all the content in a game you paid for.\n\nI would change my stance on this game in the future if either:\n1)  The ability for a single player to fight against the AI in \"versus mode\"  is added\nor \n2) An online mulitplater mode is added  \nThe second option may be a little unreasonable, but the first isn't.\n\nEither of these would allow players to play versus mode without a controller, thus giving them the ability to unlock game content that is currently unaccessible with just a keyboard.", "timestamp_created": 1395467672, "timestamp_updated": 1488033221, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 400, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704623", "comment_count": "19", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9586541": {"recommendationid": "9586541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014848439", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1744, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514061098}, "language": "english", "review": "First, go out and get at least two controllers for you computer, and then buy this game.

For such a small game, it's hard to imagine the developers possibly finding any /more/ ways they could screw it up and render it unplayable.\n\nExpect ear-splittingly loud audio when you first start the game.  Setting volume at 1/10 makes it bearable, but expect a repeat performance every time you come back.  If you're unlucky like me, you won't even be able to play anyway, because the game speed is up by at least an order of magnitude - you won't even be able to navigate the menus.  If you get that fixed, still expect random timing glitches based on whether you have vsync on.\n\nBut those are all bugs, and one presumes that if the developers have any shred of decency or respect for their consumers, they'll at least fix those.  No the real deal-breaker is the controls.\n\nControl mappings are backwards (jump/confirm swapped with shoot/cancel) and can't even be customized.  Countless side-scrollers that have come before have trained us to expect a competent layout that puts your most spammed inputs (movement) closest to the base of the thumb, and conversely your limited use controls further away.  But no, Towerfall went way out of its way to make it as hard as possible not to hit the wrong button /constantly/.  This and this alone renders the game an unplayable exercise in frustration just with the inputs.  The actual gameplay doesn't even factor in.\n\nDon't expect to be able to pick up their slack either.  Mapping controller keys to other controller keys is pretty much impossible or just not worth the exhorbitant effort depending on what hardware you have, and just mapping to keyboard keys won't work either - the game will then read both.\n\nI feel like an incredible sucker for buying this game on two steam accounts before I actually tried it - never even considered it could be this messed up, not when the reviews are so positive and only focus on gameplay and the lack of online play.  This wouldn't pass muster for a PC game in the 90s and would make a sub-par free flash game today.\n\nWhen did developers lose all respect for their customers?  We're humans, not programmable money machines.  Software conforms to us, not the other way around.  To not even bother allowing any way to remap keys - even if the default mapping weren't retarded - is just a slap in the face.  I cannot imagine in what world falling short on even this baseline effort could possibly be considered acceptable and worthy of my money.

Towerfall provides endless entertainment in simple 30 second rounds, causing immediate satisfaction and chaos.\n\nHighly suggested purchase.", "timestamp_created": 1394598986, "timestamp_updated": 1394932468, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547595", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9435541": {"recommendationid": "9435541", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999604653", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449387160}, "language": "english", "review": "Simple controls that are easy to pick up, but a lot of depth and replayability.

It may appear very simple, but it can become extremely challenging very quickly. Here's a video giving you my thoughts on the single-player side of the game (for those of us who have a hard time getting friends over).\n\nhttp://youtu.be/K81IX5qE5JQ\n\nIn summary, here are the pros and cons of the game (some as ? because it varies on the person)\n\n+ Simple controls. It makes it easy for anyone to pick up and play.\n+ High skill ceiling. While moving, shooting, jumping, and dodging are the only controls, using them all in combination to navigate the diverse courses while shooting down foes is more than challenging to say the least.\n+ Fluid gameplay. Everything responds exactly how you expect it to and when you expect it to.\n+ Local Multiplayer is a blast. It's very competitive, and when you win, damn do you feel good.\n+ Highly satisfying when you perform well. It takes a lot of skill to do this, and when you do, you know it.\n+ A lot of enemy variety with different mechanics.\n\n? Extremely challenging. You can make it so difficult, that you will never beat a level unless you perform near perfection. The one-hit-kill system makes this so.\n? Even on normal, it doesn't hold your hand. You will die and fail multiple times before you learn the map's patterns and enemies so you can complete it. The time will differ greatly from person to person.\n? The single player is decent. It's nowhere near as fun as the multiplayer, but that's to be expected of most games.\n\n- No tutorial. The best I could find was something in the options menu that gives you hints, but you have to look for it. With something as difficult as this, anything that helps is greatly appreciated.\n- IMO, I wish they used better quality sprites like the ones they have when you select your character. Just a small ding for this, though. Graphics only matter to a certain extent.\n- This can be very frustrating in later levels. You just can't see everything that's coming at you, and when enemies fill the screen, it only makes it that much worse. Best thing to do is set it down and come back later, but that may be never depending on how bad it pissed you off.\n- It's local multiplayer only. It cuts off a really good part of the game for those people who can't get people over to play. And I can't help but feel this game would've really benifited from having online servers so you can play multiplayer anytime.\n\nIn conclusion, get it for the multiplayer. You're gonna have a blast with it. If you have time to kill and like a challenge, then consider getting it for the single player. It's not bad for the price.\n\n*Update*\n\nIf you guys wanna see what the Co-op Quest is like, here's another video highlighting the mayhem and hilarity that it brings. To be honest, I think it even makes this game more challenging than doing it alone.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/Pzcb2Lb2Jbw\n\n\n*Final Update*\n\nHere is some of the Versus mode.

TowerFall is that experience and more. Matches are fierce and exciting. They are the perfect length to allow players to rotate out without feeling too short. You\u2019ll be cheering and yelling alongside everyone else as you wait for your turn.\n\nTowerFall is a masterclass example of intentional game design. Nothing feels out of place or missing. The controls and pacing have been fine tuned to create the best possible experience.\n\nWhile multiplayer is the main focus, and is amazing, there is a substantial amount of single player content. I\u2019d like to focus on that in this review since everyone else is going to talk about multiplayer.\n\nIn quest mode you take on waves of enemies with a friend or by yourself. There\u2019s one level for every tower with normal and hardcore difficulties, which I would rename to hardcore and insane. Waves and enemy movement are not random, they have been carefully designed to provide a varied and challenging experience. Even the simplest of enemies can be a huge obstacle with so much going on at once. The boss fights are epic too.\n\nPerhaps the most challenging mode in TowerFall is trials mode. It\u2019s like break-the-targets in Smash Bros. but way more intense. Each trial is like a puzzle -- figure out the optimal way to beat it -- then figure out how to pull it off. Gold times are set so someone moderately good at the game might have a chance with practice. Diamond times are even harder with most set to under a few seconds. It feels very satisfying when you pull it off. Each trial feels unique and like the game is trying to teach you something.\n\nTowerFall is a beautiful game with an insane amount of visual polish. While its character and environment designs stand out, the details and animation are what puts it over the top. Everything from how the character moves to the environment details such as dripping water or crumbling skeletons.\n\nThis review is not complete without talking about the audio design. Each character has a unique set of sound effects. This not only gives them individual personalities but also lets you know what\u2019s happening elsewhere on the screen. The soundtrack is also worthy of much praise. Each tower has a unique track that matches the visuals perfectly. It echos the gameplay both in tempo and mood and tells a story at the same time.\n\nMultiplayer is what you buy the game for but single player is very good too.

I was first introduced to Falcom games through their incredible Legend of Heroes games and I have always been curious of the Ys franchise for the past couple of years. I figured it was time to stop pondering and take the plunge into Ys Seven, their first 3d Ys title.\n\nAll in all, this game screams Falcom storytelling and action, which is a fantastic thing to behold. It took some time to get used to how the game works since I have been so used to the turn based combat of the Trails series, but once I got the hang of it, it became really fun to play.\n\nPros:\n\nExcellent, fast paced combat.\nGood story that draws you in over time.\nFun characters with interesting and funny dialogue.\nPlenty of combat Skills that offer variaty of ways to fight.\nGood soundtrack, but not even close to the quality of the Kiseki series of soundtracks.\n\nCons:\n\nA lot of grinding to get everything.\nSome environments were annoying to traverse, until you get the item that stops the issue.\n\nIn general, this game does many things right and I am eagerly waiting for Ys 8: Lacrimosa of Dana to make its debut onto PC soon, despite XSEED Games not being the ones helming the game. After playing Ys 7, I may consider going back to play the past Ys titles. I definitely recommend Ys 7 to be experienced by those who are: fans of the Falcom games, enjoy fast paced combat, or enjoy a good story, despite the grinding that is most definitely going to occur from the start.\n\nHope you all enjoy this game as much as I have!", "timestamp_created": 1514573199, "timestamp_updated": 1514573199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38787320": {"recommendationid": "38787320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145527633", "num_games_owned": 796, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 3131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514286209}, "language": "english", "review": "Ys SEVEN, ys game with party system, Adol + 6 companion.\n\nA long game compared to other in series, so the story is more developed too ^^\nMusic is great as always ^^", "timestamp_created": 1514481150, "timestamp_updated": 1514481161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526357", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38722492": {"recommendationid": "38722492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315507036", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514345944}, "language": "english", "review": "Really fun game to binge play or to casually play here and there.

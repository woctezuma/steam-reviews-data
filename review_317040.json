Provided that you're fine with the graphics.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nGameplay is your standard Doom 1-style run-and-strafe-and-gun first-person shooter. But it also has some adventure elements, in that you can walk around towns, talk to people, and buy equipment.\n\nThe Veteran Version fixes a bug with one quest where, if you accept it & get the item, you're essentially locked out of ~1/3 of the game. I won't spoil what quest that is because of that, to leave it up to you to make your own mistakes.\n\nI haven't gotten far enough in the game to see if some of the robots still attack you regardless whether you've done anything wrong in their general vicinity or not, though.\n\nStill, do be careful not to fire a weapon in town, or else every guard will be after you. A lot of the enemies can and will hit you hard, even on lower difficulties, and your two main weapons (the Knife and Crossbow) are relatively weak.\n\nOne thing I found real annoying is that a lot of choices the game gives you are \"But thou must\" moments. Meaning you're not allowed to say no, unless you don't want to progress the story. At least the Veteran Version doesn't make all the guards aggro you when you say \"no,\" now. That, or they just outright removed the option to say \"no,\" like to the Resistance leader, for example.\n\nSome areas can be excessively maze-like; narrow and off-putting, like the requisite Sewers, but otherwise are open with lots of nooks and crannies to explore for ammo and equipment.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story is your typical dystopian future kind of setting; meteors, ruling class which hoards most of the world's remaining technology and uses it to enslave the rest of the people.\n\nThis version even includes the blurb about your character's role prior to starting the game that used to only be in the instruction manual! Nice touch, there.\n\nYou start out helping the resistance, but can switch to helping the Big Bads in charge later on, lending itself to an alternate ending.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe graphics are on par with the original Doom, with several options to make the edges look less jagged and add more detail to light sources and so on. The sky looks a lot better now compared to the original game.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nThe controls are your standard adjustable-mapping keyboard interface for FPSes, with the option to use your mouse to aim and shoot, or use a controller if you really want one.\n\nI found one thing you need to be careful about is using the Left Mouse Button as your Confirmation Button, as it's also your Attack Button. Almost stabbed the odd NPC or two with an accidental double click.\n\nIf you're using your mouse as to aim (which I don't know WHY you wouldn't), I recommend switching the Run key (default: right Shift) to another option. One more... easily reached by your left hand.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nThe music throughout the game is good. There's a handful of tracks that really stood out for me, but most just kind of blended into the scenery. Nothing stood out as being completely horrible, though.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nOverall, I say the game is worth the purchase. If you're not sure if the game's right for you, then do more research on your own. Look at more screenshots, maybe a video or two about it, or read some of the other reviews. Or don't.

They've stolen your children so they can be brainwashed into a dark cult.\n\nThese vile beings call themselves the Order.\n\nYou and your fellow man have been driven underground. But you're not going to go down without a fight. It doesn't matter how many minions they have. It's time for action. Weapons are being built. Soldiers are being trained. The revolutionary thought of Man has been reborn in spirit. It is time for action.\n\n\n\nIt's time for a rebellion.\nIt's time for a revolution.\nIt's time for [strike]fable[/strike] STRIFE!\n\n[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1]\n\nThink DOOM. Seriously, just think DOOM. The shooting mechanics are pretty similiar and solid, each weapon feels impactful and when you hit your enemy it has that same sort of feeling. The animations, sprites, it all comes together to have that idea of kicking alien mutated cultist ass and look good doing it.\n\nYour weapons range from a petty knife to a f u c k i n g god killer. In the beginning you start with a knife before meeting a contact. Then he gives you a crossbow with an electric twist ontop of the arrow itself. It's actually pretty cool and when firing it you kind get a feel for the game's \"Physics\". After that, you later make your way up to an Assault Rifle that feels pretty good to shoot. When firing it - it has this feeling of rippling through your enemy. Later, you can get a flamethrower and torpedo cannon to raise havoc.\n\nBut what the hell are you shooting? Good question. Like I said, they're essentially religious fanatics that have been augmented with cybernetics and mutated by a goddamn comet with a god complex. In other words..., they're the Inquisition.\n\nYou'll first notice your first line of enemies: \n\nThe Minions. They're the Order's Secret Police and are charged with maintaing the status quo. Usually, you'll see them guard the hubworld and work under political officials who are trying to make it in this oppressive society. They carry large shields that cover half of their bodies and fire assault rifles while firing. They're pretty intimidating and are generally the Order's Imperial Guard but badass. Personally, I find them to be pretty cool for an enemy and they don't really have faces since their helmets literally hide a pair of bright red eyes with demonic voices but... they do their best to kill you. You'll find more advanced versions of them but that's about it. \n\nThen you have your mechanic demi gods and destrucive androids with the only mission of: KILL! KILL! KILL! \nThey create a nice enemy to face and are very interesting - I kind of wish the world itself had a more fleshed out universe  with more of an explanation of the lore. It would have been interesting if this game had a sort of RPG element to it other than it's dialogue. Speaking of which, this game has dialogue. You'll be talking to characters but it's mostly filler and I believe there are branching endings later on which have different consequences to how you deal with shit.\n\nAnyways, onto...\n\n[h1] THE WORLD [/h1]\n\nNow, the world of Strife is pretty simple. It's a hubworld that unlocks over time and as you complete certain stages, you help the Front fight back against the Order. You'll find the Minions guarding certain areas and will attack you if you do some stupid shit like... I don't know... start kill people? Generally, the world seemed to be in a Medieval tech level before the [strike] fire nation attacked [/strike] comet struck the planet. Leaving the world sort of clashing with a cutting edge sci-fi culture. It's fairly interesting.\n\nSeeing a mesh of cybernetics and togas is pretty cool. Really, you kind of see the culture resembling like a strange assortment of that medieval culture but it's interesting to see how the people sort of adapted to their new way of life. It's clear that there is a newer generation of people that know only the Order and the older that knows what life was like before the comet. Sure, it's your cliche [b] \"aliens have attacked and life has changed\" [/b] story but I like this one.\n\nAnyways, that's the world in a nutshell.\n\n[h1] SUMMARY [/h1]\n\nEssentially, the version of DOOM where shit went to shit because a gigantic comet who wanted to enslave humanity played god instead of Satan himself coming from the bowels of hell to rape us. And instead of playing Doomguy - my fucking hero who owned the original space marine in space about to rape the alien overlords, we play... Mercenaryjoe. The only thing he has going for him, is that his enemies might underestimate him due to the fact that he looks like Anakin Skywalker but forget the whole Darth Vader shit.\n\nJokes aside. \nIt's a nice game.\n For a nice price.\n\n\n[b]Get it.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1506890692, "timestamp_updated": 1506890780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527538", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34894840": {"recommendationid": "34894840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012365834", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511828368}, "language": "english", "review": "Where the hecks do I go?", "timestamp_created": 1505190017, "timestamp_updated": 1505190017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.374138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34469559": {"recommendationid": "34469559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049390381", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509657178}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily my favourite retro game, and I say that knowing all the classics by ID, Apogee and 3DRealms through and through. It has everything it possibly could - enthralling setting (techno-fantasy postapocalypse with guns, castles and cyborg templars as your enemies - could it ever get more awesome?!) great story (there are some illusoric choices - that's bad, but forgiveable - and some that can block the way for you, which is actually brilliant. No modern game ever did that!), a wide array of cool guns to put your hands on, multiple endings... \n\nAnd a really, really sexy sidekick. Yeah, she's just a voice in your comm, but man, what a voice it is!\n\nWeapons you get seem gimmicky - among which there's an assault rifle that is a good all-rounder but rips through your ammo reserves like crazy, a plasma shotgun which is cool but even worse in this aspect, a grenade launcher that is really easy to blow yourself up with, a psionic relic that shoots thunder and lightning at the expense of your own health (and gets more and more powerful with each big bad you murder)... And a dagger that in your capable hands is able to turn enemies into red mist. All of these require careful inventory management and take some actual skill to aim and fire. \n\nManaging your health is even more important - you can buy more medical supplies for gold, but there's never enough of both. All in all, on higher difficulty levels Strife really offers a challenge.\n\nIt's a pseudo-open world - sort of, as locations are opened to you one by one as story progresses. You are able to revisit, and some of the levels are purely optional. By the end, the game does get a little crazy with numbers of enemies set against you which seems a bit tedious, but the story is about enough compelling to keep you moving forward.\n\nStrife was way ahead of its time, but went through in the shadow of other, louder titles, despite being so much better than most of them. It just isn't right to leave it here, forgotten, unknown. If you enjoy old school FPSes, you simply cannot pass on this one.

However, I found it shallow compared to the other games I played. The first third or fourth of the game was exciting, but the rest eventually got a bit repetitive.

Probably it didn't made much fuss because the year it was launched we got titles such as duke3d, c&c red alert, tomb raider, diablo, harvester, and so many great titles back in '96. I remember Strife being the first FPS with RPG elements such as improving your health, accuracy, talking to NPCs, a hub world, etc.\n\nThe story is nice, also was one of the other major differences from the other FPS. While most games had clich\u00e9 generic plots, this one had a bit more added into it. Also the dialogs with some cartoonish cutscenes that helped you grind through the plot. Another cool thing was the woman as your sidekick guiding you through the missions. Strife also had very cool graphics, a mix between medieval and modern styles which I loved. \n\nRegarding the AI, not much to say. The enemies didn't have anything notably aside from shooting you and chasing you if you do something stupid in town and sound the alarm. They didn't pack a lot of challenge, just keep shooting and dodging and you'll be fine. In hardest difficulties you just get more enemies and they did more damage to you. Your weapons are very nice, though they didn't give you anything notably new. You have your basic machine gun, RPG, flamethrower, grenade launcher and such. You can only have so much of your 'traditional' gun arsenal compared to other games.\n\nOverall it's a good addition to anyone who loved 90's shooters. It has some cool elements and features that were new back then and totally worth checking it.

However, those hardworking guys at Night Dive Studios managed to get ahold of the rights and, in 2014, released this remaster on Steam for all to play. I recently completed it, and I thought it was pretty good overall.\n\nThe presentation is great. There're some genuinely excellent cinematics, art, writing, and voice acting. The pixel art has a nice, clean, simple aesthetic that portrays personality as well as clearly communicating what things are and what they're doing. The story's pretty good, and it's helped a lot by voice-acted conversations with NPCs, complete with various dialogue options. This was also one of the last games to be released that uses the then-outdated idTech 1 engine, and a lot of stuff's been added to it, including full mouselook and perspective correction. The environments have a wonderful sense of place, seeming almost like locations where people would live and work. Overall, Strife is just great to look at and listen to.\n\nOn the gameplay side of things, Strife isn't quite as good but still does pretty well. The shooting is alright, with eight different weapons to choose from (some with different ammo types; actually, Strife might be the first FPS to have that). A lot of them have easily recognizable DOOM equivalents, but they're still fun to use and have a nice amount of variety. There's also an inventory, which integrates into the game well enough and is even nice enough to auto-use health items when you're about to die. The game is hub-based, but there're only like three hubs total (although it is nice that you can travel to any part of the game world at any time).\n\nStrife also experiments with different gameplay styles, which is certainly ahead of its time. There's a pretty basic upgrade system that consists of two linear upgrade paths to increase health and accuracy, and one weapon that gets more powerful as you progress. There's also an attempted stealth element, where in some areas enemies won't shoot you unless you shoot them or do something incriminating. It's not that well-implemented, though; for instance, some NPCs you can talk to in hostile areas don't have dialogue that reflects whether you're stealthing or not, so you can shoot three guards right in front of them and they'll still tell you not to blow your cover by doing anything suspicious. This doesn't impede the game too much, though, and it's fun regardless.\n\nAdditionally, at the beginning of the game areas are pretty simple and easy to navigate, and enemies and health/ammo are well-distributed. Near the end, however, this falls apart to some degree, with levels becoming ridiculous mazes and barely enough ammunition to get past the waves and waves of enemies. I never quite ran out entirely, but a lot of the time I was down to just my starting ranged weapon and my almost-useless-against-robot-enemies flamethrower.\n\nOverall, Strife is pretty good. It looks and sounds great, it plays well, and its flaws, while sometimes frustrating, don't ruin an otherwise great experience. I recommend it.\n\nP.S.

You do get options at certain points on where to take it, and this impacts your ending of which there are really 2, one is just special and will happen regardless( you\u2019ll understand when you play it)\n\n    [*]The stealth that the game says it has I never tried as it seemed I always set off alarms when going for the objective and secrets. \n\n    [*]The weapons are typical fps guns, but are still varied and all have specific roles to fill, there is a crossbow that has 2 ammo types, meant to be swapped whether human or robot. You get a grenade launcher that has HE or AOE burning(does more damage just takes longer). My personal favorite the flamethrower, and it\u2019s actually useful for once in a game\n\n    [*]The enemies are human knight dudes, metal spiders that crawl on the ceiling, they always surprised me it seems. You got a lot of robots, some with missiles, energy blasts, or machine fire, some fly, some are fast. There are behemoth robots that can one shot kill you with their grenades, it also has an insane health pool, requiring 50 rockets to kill each, and I did not like that.\n\n    [*]80% of all enemy fire is hitscan and with the quick reflexes of the AI, this can get you to lose a lot of hp quickly. So don\u2019 expect strafing to be a useful thing here. It\u2019s more pop out and shoot, that sounds like cover based shooters, your right.\n\n    [*]The BFG style gun here is called the sigil that gets stronger after every boss fight, totaling 5 parts. It sends out electricity that uses your health as ammo. This right here sounds like good balancing, but I\u2019ll explain why I don\u2019t like this\n\n    [*]My biggest complain of the game is both the boss fights and the sigil. You have to use the sigil to kill the bosses. This wasn\u2019t an issue for all but the final 2 bosses. I had enough money to buy health packs early in the game, paired with finding a lot of them in the levels.\n\n    [*]Your sigil when fighting the final boss takes 20 hp away, I had a max of 180. I went in with no health packs bought, found enough to heal up once. This made the final boss fight insane, as I had to land every single shot max damage (kinda hard), without getting hit (wasn\u2019t that hard) to win. I repeated that fight over 20 times. I think I\u2019m probably one of the only people to ever do this, and it was so tough, but I did it, so handicap FTW\n\n\n    [*]Overall the game offers a doom style game with a hub world, items to buy, a story with quests that is passable and a great soundtrack to kill things too. I did play on Veteran difficulty, damage did seem excessive from most enemies. I would recommend playing on normal.\n [/list]\n\n[h1]My Score: [/h1]\n[b]B[/b]\n\n[b]Paid: Included in $5 Bundle[/b]\n[b]Completed in: 9.5 hours[/b]\n\nGames similar I recommend: \n[list]\n    [*]Hexen\n    [*]Intrude\n    [*]Deus Ex\n    [*]STAR WAR Jedi Knight series\n    [*]BioShock\n [/list]", "timestamp_created": 1484685465, "timestamp_updated": 1484685502, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.681474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29240469": {"recommendationid": "29240469", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993982290", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454713335}, "language": "english", "review": "Likely my favorite game of all time (maybe a bit of nostalgia?).

The game was criticised for not having equivalent graphics to it's competitors, like Duke Nukem 3D, therefore seeming outdated, and never getting the chance it deserved, and ultimately being forgotten about.\n\nIn the current age of gaming, with games like Minecraft leading the way for a comeback to an almost lost era, with games using phrases like \"pixel graphics\" and \"retro\", to hook players in, Strife finally has the chance to be what it should have been in the first place.\n\nAn Instant Classic.\n\n\n\nSomewhere above this review should be a button that says \"add to cart\".\n\n[h1]Smash it.[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1479980880, "timestamp_updated": 1481716273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26961647": {"recommendationid": "26961647", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976138498", "num_games_owned": 911, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480664993}, "language": "english", "review": "it's still the best", "timestamp_created": 1479947450, "timestamp_updated": 1479947450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26945682": {"recommendationid": "26945682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025121822", "num_games_owned": 493, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499205564}, "language": "english", "review": "An underated FPS/RPG mix on the Doom.

When I stop talking to you, you leave.\"\n\nIn my honest opinion, Strife is one of the most underrated games back in mid-90s. Unlike other first person shooters of the same age, like Duke Nukem 3D and Quake, this one is an excellent combination of first person shooter and role playing game. Despite of its Doom engine, you have lots of NPCs to interact, to ally with in order to fight against the enemy, or even to trade with your gold for their merchandises. Every major dialogue with those characters is also come with voices, performed by earnest voice actors. This boosts the game experience with its story and progression in a really good way. Speaking of the story, it also has multiple endings, affected by the choice you make during the progression. Those elements are definitely something that you couldn't see from the first person shooters back in mid-90s, and they make this game really unique.\n\nAction is pretty much something that you might expect from the game with Doom engine. You also have inventory system from other FPS like Heretic and Hexen, so you can stock your powerups and use them whenever you really need. What makes this game more unique is the stealth system. Enemy soldiers in the same sector won't attack you until you do something suspicious. That being said, you can kill the enemy acolytes with your slient weapons, such as poison bolt, and you won't sound the alarm. Though some enemy mechanics don't give a $hi+ about the stealth system and attack you, which is a little bit annoying. But who cares, since it's more fun to mow down the enemies with your assault rifle. This game also has upgrade systems for your accuracy and health, just like a level system of other role-playing games.\n\nWhat makes this game even better is this HD remastering. Now you can enjoy this game with modern elements like proper mouse aiming, better lighting effects, and perfect compatibility for your modern gaming setting. It even has objective assistant on the automap to help you find the location of next objective, which is really useful to navigate those maze-like levels. Speaking of level design, this game uses hub system like Hexen, making various levels into one giant open world with lots of explorable areas.\n\nIn overall, this is a forgotten gem from 1996, a something that ahead of the time. It is not a perfect game, but it's definitely something different from other mediocre first person shooters. A solid 9/10 stuff for me.\n\n\"Fight for the front and freedom!

It pains me to write a negative review of a Night Dive title, because they usually do excellent work (I was amazed that their Turok remaster even runs fantastically under Wine -- I don't know if that's because of anything they did, but it was awesome).\n\nThe first thing I noticed is that the high-quality renderer \"smooths\" the sprites even if this setting is turned off. Coincidentally, I also encounter this bug in the Linux version of Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition. It's possibly an issue with OpenGL, but on my system, Shadow Warrior Redux correctly displays \"retro\" textures, so clearly a well-designed program will not succumb to this issue. I've installed several different distros on this machine (a laptop from System76) and they ALL have this rendering issue. Switching to the original renderer makes the sprites nice and chunky, at the expense of all the other pretty graphical enhancements being removed. This was good enough for me, however -- !\n\nIssue number two: Controller support is all fucked-up for me. I've tried hacking together several different approaches, and none of them cause the controller to behave normally in this game. Again, Shadow Warrior Redux (an excellent example of a great Linux version of a remastered retro game) works normally with a controller without any tweaks, so I can't help but feel that this is something the developers could fix.\n\nThis is not a well-designed Linux port in my eyes. It's great on Windows, however, and if that's your OS I heartily recommend grabbing this game.

Yet, the game most often remembered as \u201cthe first FPS/RPG\u201d is Strife.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason for that. Even the first minutes of Strife feel very different. You start the game, fight a couple of guards and then, instead of killing demons, you walk into a peaceful town, with various shops, a bar and some interactive NPCs throwing gossip. \n\nYou\u2019re then contacted via radio by \u201cBlackbird\u201d, who asks you to join The Front, an underground resistance against the evil theocracy of The Order. This isn\u2019t just some throwaway backstory \u2013 you\u2019ll actually go to the rebel\u2019s HQ and work with them.\n\nYour first objective is to take over The Order\u2019s base in town. For that you\u2019ll have to perform a few sabotage missions and trade favors with other NPCs \u2013 all of whom have charming voice acting and portraits. Once the base\u2019s defenses are down, you\u2019ll attack it alongside rebel troops, kill the enemy general and move your HQ there! It\u2019s a nice, satisfying pay-off.\n\nAfter that the town\u2019s gate opens and you\u2019re sent to another location, to further battle the forces of The Order. The world is hub-based, with the maps linking together to form an overworld of sorts you can freely explore, thought the main quest is mostly linear. \n\nSome of your missions can also involve stealth, meaning disguising yourself and only killing enemies with a poisoned crossbow. As your quest advances you\u2019ll uncover more about The Order, learn about the mythic Sigil and experience some great plot twists.\n\nYou\u2019ll also gain access to new weapons and upgrades, such as a grenade launcher or increased accuracy stat. Just be sure to carefully manage your money between health kits, armor and ammo.\n\nFinally, while most of the dialog options are illusionary, there\u2019s a choice about half the way into the game that forks the game into two different routes, each with different missions and endings.\n  \nStrife was the last game to use the Doom engine, which was already heavily dated.

With Heretic, they introduced an inventory system. In Hexen, they made hub worlds. And the Build engine is basically an upgraded DOOM engine with more possibilities for level design with layered floors, destructible scenery and explosions. So what can Strife add to shooters in 1996.\n\nStory:\nUnlike other shooter which just had a story to add context to what's going on, Strife has a story with characters and pacing. Not a great story but an enjoyable one. One day, a comet crashed into earth and a plague killed a good chuck of the population was wipe out. However, many survivors started to hear a voice and made a religous movement called the Order which enslaved humanity and kill the women and children. Now a rebel force call the Front to take down this evil force, once and for all.\n\nSo, yeah. Not special but it works and I even have a theory about one part of the story. One thing I do like is the choice you'll have to make which changes not so much the tone but the structure of the story. One path makes the game shorter by making it, just kill the bosses, the other lets you explore a whole other area.\nThere aren't that many major outside of Macil and the Oracle but most prominent is your radio partner, Blackbird, who mainly gives you commentary and what and who you should be looking for. I'm not the biggest fan of her but I do enjoy her dark sense of humour.\n\nGameplay:\nI want to talk about the weapons first, mainly because I think they're pretty mixed: The knife starts out weak but slowly becomes useful to take out guards later after some upgrades, the cross bow is weak unless you have poison arrows, the rifle is the all-purpose gun, I didn't get much use from the flame thrower, the mauler is a powerful shotgun, the grenade launcher is powerful but hard to aim and the rocket launcher, while a decent weapon, is one of the weakest rocket launchers I've ever used. Then there's the plot important Sigil: very powerful but I don't use that much before I got a new upgrade for it outside of boss fights, then again it uses your health to use and you'll need all the health you can get.\n \nLike Hexen, this game has a hub system where you can explore, and talk to people. That's right. Talk to people. normal people, shopkeepers and even enemy guards who aren't trying to kill you yet. Sure, not everyone has anything interesting to say but it's a nice feature considering the tech. Also you can buy health, ammo and armour at shop scattered around the world and in some area's you can upgrade your accuracy and stamina. Stamina increase your health and how strong your knife is and the accuracy...I don't know, maybe help with aiming, I didn't notice. \n\nPresentation:\nWhile each level does have a different look to it, the colour pallet might make some levels repetitive like the factory section or the fortress and the enemies design are pretty bland and the villagers are just the same guy with different shirts. I will admit I really love the way the whole world is layout. If you put all the maps together, you get an open world that explore but there's properly nothing in it. I still thinks it's cool.\n\nThe music is pretty enjoyable but like the music for the town or the power plant and the voice acting is fun in a hammy way. Also, the art for the cut-scenes and character portraits look good, if a bit cartoony but I'm okay with that. \n\nVerdict:\nThe last \"offical\" DOOM engine game I'm aware of and definetly worth it. Not my favorite shooter but a top ten contender.\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1469901639, "timestamp_updated": 1469901639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503601", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24607893": {"recommendationid": "24607893", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999363278", "num_games_owned": 1986, "num_reviews": 224, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435204608}, "language": "english", "review": "Ridiculously ambitious RPG made using the Doom Engine.\n\nIt has not aged  NEARLY as well as  Doom did, but it is extremely neat.\nI remember it being fondly remembered in home of the underdogs!", "timestamp_created": 1469851551, "timestamp_updated": 1469851551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551706", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24589700": {"recommendationid": "24589700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051799142", "num_games_owned": 427, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470728225}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "[h1]Strife \u00e9 um RPG que teve em base o Doom original, ou seja, possui a mesma engine grafica e o mesmo tipo de design.[/h1] \n\n[b] O que eu deveria saber antes de comprar?

How should you approach them? Should you review them based on how it stacks up against its contemporaries, or should you review it based on how it stacks up against modern titles? Reviewing games you played when you were younger is even harder, nostalgia can make even a kinda bad game seem good. I'm a firm believer in basing my reviews on how good the game is \"now\" rather than how good it used to be.\n\nStrife is a game I have no nostalgia towards, I had never played it until I got it on steam. It's not even a game I was aware of, apart from recognizing a few still images in the game from screenshots people have posted online in the past.\n\nStrife bills itself as the original FPS-RPG, but the RPG elements are very light. System Shock 1 is more of an RPG than this game, and I would not really call System Shock an RPG either. \n\n[b]Graphics & Sound[/b]\nStrife is a game from 1996, and from a purely technical standpoint, it does of course not hold up well if compared to any modern game. It uses a modified version of the DOOM engine, that has been upgraded further by fans, which gives it some nice lighting effects, higher resolutions and a few other tweaks, which makes it far better looking than it did at release, but it's still built on old technology.\n\nAll items, characters & enemies are 2D sprites. They're nice looking sprites, which makes good use of colours and shapes to give everything its own unique look, which clearly stands out against the background, but they're still just sprites. If you've played any other contemporary shooter, other than Quake, you'll know what to expect. The spritework is quite nice, and the game has a pleasing and consistent art style.\n\nThe music is relatively good, but I feel that the limitations of its era holds it back, as it sounds a bit artificial (and not in an intentional way). It's also a bit too noticeable at points, which is not great for background music. Still, I'm glad that it's there. The sound effects are better, and most of the weapons have beefy sound effects, that make them satisfying to use.\n\nThe voice acting, and there's a surprising amount of it, is all over the place. Sometimes the voice actors do a really good job, portraying their characters in a believable way, other times they really overact, and it enters parody territory. It does not hold a candle compared to today's big budget productions, many of which hire really good voice actors, but most of the important characters have appropriate voice actors.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nThe story is a strange mix of sci-fi and fantasy. if you've just looked at the still images that are shown during the game, you could easily mistake this for a generic fantasy CRPG.\nA comet struck your planet, and it released a virus that killed a large portion of the population. Many of those infected who did not die from the virus were mutated by it, and started hearing the words of an evil god in their heads. They formed \"The order\", a religious organization that through superior technology and fanaticism has forced the population into servitude.\n\nYou're a mercenary who find yourself at odds with the order. Right at the start of the game you get recruited into a resistance movement, who work to bring down The Order.\nFor a shooter, the story is surprisingly important in this game. The story is, for the most part, well told, even if it's not always well paced. This is hardly Oscar winning material, but it does a good job at immersing you in the world of Strife, and it remains interesting through the course of the game. \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nFor a game based on the DOOM-engine, strife is surprisingly open. The minute to minute gameplay works like in most other DOOM-engine games, which means that you need to use your high movement speed & ability to strafe in order to avoid damage, while shooting at enemies with a verity of weapons. Like other DOOM-engine games, the game does not expect you to have pixel-perfect precision, but instead  the game does most of the aiming for you. This is a bit at odds with the mouse look that they introduced in the Veteran Edition (this was not present in the original), and it can make some combat encounters too easy.\n\nMost levels in this game are at least a bit maze-like, and you need to run around, looking for keys and switches. The level design is good enough most of the time for it to be quite easy to figure out where to go next, but there are a few occasions where a combination of similar-looking textures and confusing level design gets in the way. The sewer section, which happens early in the game, is the worst offender, but there's one more level later on that's rather annoying.\n\nUnlike most DOOM-based games, this game allows for some stealth. There are times when you'll get enemy uniforms, and as long as you don't do anything obviously bad, like shooting a loud weapon or attack someone in front of a bunch of other people, living enemies will let you get by unmolested. You can even take down enemies with your knife or crossbow without raising an alarm. Robots will see right through your disguise though, but even if a robot is shooting at you, enemies around you won't react, it's not until you attack the robot that it will shoot back.\n\nAlso unlike most shooters, this game is a semi-open world game. New parts of the map will unlock as you progress through the story, and you can always go back to older ones, and are in fact expected to do so on several occasions. The world is not all that big, and your high movement speed makes this backtracking rather painless, and it does help the world feel more cohesive.\n\n[b]Final thoughts[/b]\nStrife must have been a really impressive game back when it was first released. These days it's not all that impressive, but it's still a really good game. The fast paced combat is fun and the story is surprisingly interesting through the entire game. It has a few flaws here and there, but nothing that seriously holds the game back, and despite its age, it's still a game worth playing, even for those with no nostalgia towards it.

You can also play the game as its original version (some 'vanilla' bugs are included) or the newer version that has some extras, with or without the newer graphics.\n\nThe story goes that after a meteor crashed on the planet and killed thousands, it spread a virus where the affected got mad by hearing a voice and called themselves 'the order'. Those who could not hear the voice where used as slaves or even guinea pigs, as a result a rebel movement is forged, 'the front', to fight the order. You are a mercenary that gets captured by the order and gets involved with the front. The world, while not extremely huge, may still surprise you given that there are a lot hidden items in seemingly empty areas or even hidden rooms, and a lot of different paths or backdoors in the various levels for you to explore! It also requires some thinking in addition of the mindless killing of baddies! For example: a friendly NPC tells me that in X room there are weapons, but the room is locked. The quest continues and after a while I meet an NPC that mentions that he had just finished stocking some weapons. So.... killing the NPC did gave me the key I needed!\n\nThe only negatives are, the aiming in regards to different levels (higher/lower) that can be clunky even with the games aim assist, few voice dialogues that do not have subtitle support but are quite easy to understand if you pay attention, and the graphics. Now I did not play this game for its graphics and frankly I like this retro-style a lot more than fully 3D games, but the issue is that on first sight the game is a brick of mud, that once you wash it, the gold sparkles! So sadly, it may not receive the attention it deserves.\n\nI usually don't rate games because I find it hard to evaluate stuff like graphics, however, given that graphics here are not in the question I give this jewel, a solid 10 out of 10 just because it managed to entertain me the entire time I was playing it!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThis game was given to me by the steamified group.\nFor similar reviews and great giveaways feel free to visit http://www.steamified.com", "timestamp_created": 1463373736, "timestamp_updated": 1463982199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508880", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22895151": {"recommendationid": "22895151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083595025", "num_games_owned": 2203, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462885541}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e DOOM \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0420\u041f\u0413. \u041d\u043e \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e.", "timestamp_created": 1462886380, "timestamp_updated": 1462886380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22656162": {"recommendationid": "22656162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044140048", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 121, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "last_played": 1515524599}, "language": "english", "review": "The original Strife is great but this Official re-release is just fantastic!!!

Why am I playing Strife in 2015?! Answer: because it is the best FPS game I've ever played, easily topping classics like Quake and Doom.\n\nAfter a comet struck the Earth, a virus spread and those infected not only presented horrible mutations, but also started hearing the voice of a malignant god in their head. They established \"The Order\" that took the power and oppressed and enslaved those which were not infected. Of course, that's where you come: you play as a newcomer member of The Resistance, seeking to overthrow the Order and its wickedness.\n\nThe game is your classic FPS with some basic RPG elements. You have a main city where you can peacefully shop for supplies, you have a bunch of quests and some decisions that will fork the final outcome of your efforts. MANY secret doors and stashes, hidden rooms and optional sections of maps that you'd explore just because. You lack of a character sheet, skills and the likes, but you will improve your Health and Accuracy along the game, that being the closest to \"level up system\" you'll find in there. Just like in FPS games, you have a great variety of weapons, but in Strife, THEY ARE DIFFERENT far beyond the \"damage\" factor, and you'll find yourself resorting to your first crossbow every now and then even at the end of the game.\n\nThe achievements are fun and natural, just encouraging the player to explore more the scenario and teasing with its highest difficulty: Bloodbath. You think you're good just until the enemies start respawning quicker than you can kill them. And THAT'S when you run out of ammo. \n\nLinux port is flawless (thanks for supporting the Penguin!)\n\nThe whole concept is so great and well executed, the voice acting is SO GOOD (gotta love Blackbird!

You can even set it to fm-midi mode so that it sounds like the old one did in DOS years ago.  Great game, using the old DooM engine (this possibly uses zdoom bases? - don't quote me on that).   Gives a little bit of character progression with increasing health and increasing ammo capacities and such.  New weapons now and then.  Nothing like today's games, but you can definitely tell this was a game changer, although a bit un-noticed by many - due to a lack of good marketing to really get the game out there.  Totally awesome, and in today's time you don't have to worry about deleting the voices.wad file to save 30mb (if you do, no one will ever speak to you again).

Strife is a game made on id Tech 1, but it does a lot of interesting things with it that you wouldn't expect to see from the same engine that powered Doom. Strife has more of an RPG atmosphere, and features a persistent semi-open world with stores to shop at, people to talk to, voice acted dialogue, and even a few side quests. There are slight stealth elements, and though it goes more by the old rules of \"it's still stealth as long as nobody's alive to sound the alarm\" than any particularly fleshed-out system, a few of the game's missions can be played pretty differently by utilizing it. It's not a particularly in-depth RPG, mind you - the only stats you have are health and accuracy, and both are only increased at set moments instead of having any sort of XP system, the world isn't particularly large, and the story is generally pretty linear, outside of 3 or 4 optional levels and side quests, and most of the actual mission levels play more like standard Doom than any sort of RPG, but it's still an interesting take on the Doom formula.\n\n This particular version includes a few new things that weren't in the original, like a set of talismans that can be found in secret areas and a full new side-level to fight through with a new side quest to go along with it. The veteran edition is generally pretty well-made, but I did have a lot of problems with the vertical auto-aim; with it on, certain weapons like the rocket launcher tend to have a lot of trouble hitting enemies placed higher than you, but with it off I found other weapons like the assault rifle having strange accuracy issues, forcing me to aim about an inch below enemies to actually hit them. Overall, Strife isn't necessarily an amazing game, and the level design can be a bit dull at times, but it's still a pretty fun overlooked game that's interesting to see at the very least, if only to see the unique things they managed to do with the RPG functions.", "timestamp_created": 1449558232, "timestamp_updated": 1449558232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512861", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19528608": {"recommendationid": "19528608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043782587", "num_games_owned": 1445, "num_reviews": 390, "playtime_forever": 815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488711214}, "language": "english", "review": "Strife: Quest for Sigil, aka Strife: Trust No One, aka The Original Strife, aka Strife Not MOBA, is a FPS that came out in 1996, developed by Rogue Software. It's known for still using Doom engine, albeit a modified one, and mixing a bit of RPG elements into it, like a next step from Hexen.\nIt was counted as abandonware as Rogue Software went bankcrut and source code was lost too for a long time. But Night Dive Studio, known for bringing games into legal digital age out of void of rights conspiracies, got contacted by developers and hired two Doom community members who were able to reverse-engineer the game, also basing their work from Chocolate Strife project, which allows you to run Strife without DOSBox or any fancyness. Plus artist. And so in 2014 we got Veteran Edition for Steam, which brings it to modern standarts, uses Steam features and got few more additions.\nThus I conclude my inglorious Wiki research.\n\nTechnical-wise, this game should work well, with widescreen-support and many other things. Though I heard some complaints that some fail to run this game. Strange.\n\nMultiplayer is said to be quite early and as you can guess there is not multiplayer community actively playing it. Like, gee, what did you expect, especially when there is Skulltag/Zandronum multiplayer source port for all Doom engine games.\n\n\nThe plot is quite simple in that you are mercenary who was taken for interrogation by the Order, religious dark monarchy which took over the land. And now you shall rebel and search for the Front, the resistance. And then weird stuff. With plotholes.\nSetting is awesome, being mix of tech and colorful medivel.\nAnd so you will talk with NPCs, with main ones being awesomely voiced, sometimes choosing an answer, but mostly moving along the linear path. Still fun.\n\nAs for the game itself, well, it's a Doom clone mostly. With a bit of RPG and very light weird stealth. Then again, \"Doom clone\" usually stands as \"good game\" in my book.\n\nAnd I have hard time writing anything interesting about action part of a game. It's fine. You got few weapons, inlcuding super-gimmick weapon that zaps your health. There are few types of enemies. You also got interesting weapons, inlcuding mini-bazooka, which isn't as strong as expected but at least it's more accurate than assault rifle in early game, or crossbow with electric bolts which is equal to pistol, or grenade launcher which is powerful as hell, but only if you master it enough not to have it bounce two offset grenades back at you.\n\nAnd it's mostly unrefined, you mostly will be attacked by hitscan or fast projectiles. So it's not awesome as in Id games, mostly on Build engine games level. At least I wasn't frustrasted here. Mostly because the game be default automatically uses two types of medkits from inventory when you are low on health, so the way it works you pretty much have extended lifebar. And healthkits are very common in this game.\n\nThen there is a bit of erm stealth, as some may note. There are two weapons in the game that will not alert the current sections. Dagger-punch and poison bolt. Punching people into face may take a while and enemies who see you will wake up. On other hand, poison bolt insta-kill organic things, but doesn't harm robots.\n\nAnd look, it's probably there just to have town sections working, where you aren't supposed to kill anybody. Yep, there is such section, with shopkeepers to buy ammo and health and items from. And so this stealth is weird. You can shoot poison bolt into face of acolyte in front of everybody and no one will care. And most robots will always chase to kill you even if you didn't activate the alarm, while everybody is totally cool with murder robots on the loose. If anything, it feels like you are a sly person who abuses his civilian rights in the world of robot laws. Which would make a pretty interesting game, hm.\nNo, no level can be stealthed. Only to some point to feel pro about knowing the map. Too many mandatory alarm-activated gates. So back to Doom clone gameplay.\n\nAnd it has light RPG elements. Mostly that you can talk with some NPCs and buy stuff. And travel to any level you already beat. And town. And you got two stats you can increase by completing missions, sorta: accuaricy and stamina. Accuaricy is about slowly turning your Assault Rifle from shotgun to all-range weapon that runs out of bullets fast. By the way, no, Targeter item doesn't increase it, it just points out how bad it is. Stamina increases your max health and strenght of a punch. So you could stealth those spiders better.\nAlso, almost no other interesting inventory item, aside from teleporter beacon which sends in weak ally rebels so you could horde bullets from them.\n\n\nNow, let's talk about excellent Veteran edition. It changed many things, however it has a lot of options you can tweak, to enable motion blur or to make it play and look close to original. It even keeps unaltered original wad files in the folder. It actually looks very good on default setting. Usually Doom engine games look very flat in OpenGL when compared to Software, which avoids flatness by employing fog-like light effect. But thanks to having lightmaps and making light sources to give off OpenGL light, it looks damn excellent.\nPlus mouse control.\n\nThey also went ahead and removed all the nasty dead ends. In original you could die by choosing dialog option which offends character enough to call infinite spawn of guards, for some reason. Chalice item also was a red herring, which makes it impossible to talk with important NPC who will try to kill you now, probably making your only save slot in original version useless. Dropping item didn't do anything, nope. Now most offending dialog were removed and Chalice just will punish you slightly, but not put you into dead end. I approve.\n\nDid I tell you that this version includes the demo campaign as well? Nope, chalise quest wasn't changed there as it's the only quest and you have to figure out what to do. It's fun and different from full version.\n\nThere is extra content too. You now have three medallions to collect in whole game which gives you the berserker powerup, insta-killing things with melee. It was a scrapped thing in original version that you could get by giving yourself through console, cheating. Related to this new quest line of sorts, there was a blue chalice hidden as well which will give you access to totally new secret level where red medallion is waiting for you!\n\nMultiplayer is also supported too. Well, original and Veteran both only have competetive multiplayer of deathmatch. Which probably isn't much good. Like when you try to turn single-player into DM. With levels. And weapon progression. And for some reason developers of Veteran edition decided to make three new levels that play like CTF when you run them. Capture The Chalice, actually. As if they seriously were thinking that more than two people will play this at the same time.\n\n\nAnd to be honest, even though I beat this game fully now, I still think of it as \"that obscurish Doom family game\". It was pretty nice during the first part of a game, when you do preparation to attack the nearby castle by doing quests in a town, with more or less nice level design, ending with a climax battle for a castle with stupid ally rebels.\nBut after that, it was more of meh experience, being less interesting. With level design of semi-realistical 90s shooters. When mazes don't have abstract flow of id games, just being mazey for sake of it. Like, sewers. Or catacombs. Or generic overcomplex-looking factories. Or my ever hated \"grand palaces that are symmetrical for both sides\".\n\nPretty fine 90s Doom clone.", "timestamp_created": 1449417461, "timestamp_updated": 1464102391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721661", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19405282": {"recommendationid": "19405282", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991181821", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498834990}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Strife es un excelente FPS de 1996, hecho con el motor de Doom, que deriva un poco del run n' gun linear de su predecesor, con niveles no lineales, como Hexen, dialogos, compra de objetos, objetivos, e incluso actuacion de voz, su historia atrapa y la forma en la que podes tomar un final distinto realmente me sorprendio para aquella epoca.\n\nVeteran Edition retiene lo clasico del Strife Original, (aunque sin algunas opciones de dialogo, en particular las del principio)\n\nImplementa (o mejor dicho reconstruye) el modo Capture the Chalice que iba a ser implementado en la release original de Strife, pero termino siendo dejado a un lado, el modo es basicamente capturar la bandera, y provee mapas correspondientes para el modo\n\nTambien incluye mejoras graficas, como el suavizado de texturas o el filtro bilinear (Y algunas un poco excesivas para un juego de la epoca, el motion blur en particular)\n\nAnte todo, una buena aventura para adentrarse, siendo un jugador nuevo, y un buen juego para tener de coleccion, para los que adoran los FPS de aquella epoca", "timestamp_created": 1448946483, "timestamp_updated": 1448946483, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19372095": {"recommendationid": "19372095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072123867", "num_games_owned": 563, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455237757}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego es demasiado bueno :DD lo recomiendo al 100%  y hasta tiene una traduccion (buscar en los fotos de steam)", "timestamp_created": 1448825199, "timestamp_updated": 1455086734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19315318": {"recommendationid": "19315318", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978878971", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456706000}, "language": "english", "review": "Very great Source port for our modern PC's, totally recommend this game who enjoy other 90's games like Duke nukem 3D, Blood and whatnot..

And, in my opinion, they pretty much succeeded. The sprites look nice and the art style overall is very likeable, the VAs are not half bad - and this is in age when good voice acting was the exception, rather than the rule (just remember Castlevania: Symphony of the Night with its overacting VAs who apparently recorded their lines in the bathroom or something) and the music in the game is also good. Of course, the game can at times be pretty confusing and you can spend ten or twenty or  thirty minutes looking for that one switch, but this is pretty common in games of that era.\nVeteran Edition is an excellent rerelease that supports widescreen, high resolutions, linear filtering for depixelizing, mouselook and also fixes bugs of the original game.

However, there was one particular game that always stuck with me: Strife. The last commercial release to use the Doom engine, Strife mystified me with gameplay elements I had personally never seen before. Before Strife, everything had been a boomfest: Kiloblaster. Death Rally. Realms of Chaos. Doom, Heretic, Quake. All action, no bullshit. Not that that was ever a bad thing. Where doom set a space marine against demon hordes and Quake against lovecraftian horrors, Strife took a different route, blending a medieval world of tunics, crossbows and stone castles with an invading dark future of computers, killer cyborgs and energy rifles. You are a mercenary, just arrived to the small town of Tarnhill, caught in a struggle for power between the oppressive, fanatical Order and the resistance fighters of the Front- a recipe for violence, and to be sure, Strife does not shirk on big, tough fights against multiple foes, with the fast player movement and diverse range of weapons you'd expect from a 90s FPS. But Strife also had something different from other id tech games: Dialogue. It had characters with full voice-acting, a story of betrayal and ancient conspiracy, a sultry-voiced lady with a radio guiding you on your way, a hub-level system that let you revisit previous areas (I didn't play Hexen until years after the fact), hand-drawn portraits and cutscenes, an inventory system a la Heretic, shops, two branching story routes and three endings, and even a rudimentary leveling system. I did not know it at the time, and even then, I had only played the demo, but Strife was the beginning of a lifelong love of the FPS/RPG hybrid. It may have been the first RPG I ever played period- or least the first one I enjoyed (I'm looking at you, Lands of Lore.) Sadly, the studio that created Strife  closed, the source code was lost, and game was entirely out of print for almost 20 years, an unjust fate for such a gem. However, late in 2014, this \"Veteran\" edition of the game was released, and at last I was given a chance to experience Strife as it had been intended, and with yet more to offer. I would call this version the definitive edition- not only is the original game restored in its entirety, but the demo version is included as a seperate episode (with deferring dialogue and character placement from the final version), the multiplayer mode cut from the original release has been included, and there is an entire extra secret level, designed by a guy who created one of the reverse-engineered source ports and was instrumental in the release of this version. Also present are three \"talisman\" items, cut from the original release, that if gathered grant the player beserker power comparable to the powerup in Doom, turning your feeble punch-dagger into a weapon capable of destroying Inquisitors, a rare, powerful enemy that serves as a miniboss, in one or two punches. Also mercifully included are objective indicators on your map, which will certainly be a mercy to any first-time Strife players, as some of the later areas of the game are as convuluted as any Doom level. If you ever thought Doom and its derivitves were lacking a certain something, that maybe you wanted a more cinematic exprience but with that same fast, frenetic combat, then Strife might be what you're looking for.

Strife is an odd hybrid type of game; it's a FPS running on the original DOOM engine, with RPG elements and an actual plot.

The maps feel like a mix between open, realistic architecture (e.g. the Castle, the Commons) and tight, gamey, areas that feel thrown together (e.g. all the hub areas). It has one sidequest that makes the game unwinnable if you complete, which is annoying (at least the sidequest is at the start of the game so you can restart once you realize your current save is broken). And the ending is just so... cringeworthy.\n\nOverall, the game is pretty mediocre, but still fun and I enjoyed it for what it is.

It uses a hub system and when you are in town you can't shoot your guns off or you are swarmed by guards. It can get a bit maze-y but shouldn't be too hard to find your way around. It also has a rpg-like upgrade system as well where you can periodically get rewards from the trainers at base command that increase your armor and health. It is a lot like a rpg because you go talk to guys and get missions so it might be the first ever fps action rpg. I never played this much back in the day because Doom, Duke 3D and Heretic were far superior but it is still a good game and this new version is made well. No glitches or crashes so far. Well other than weirdly it gave me some stutter-lag the second time I booted up the game although I had not changed any options.

I even had suspicions about what I was doing as I did it. I still did it. Reloaded and went a different route. Then I started wondering where the Doom was in this supposed Doom style game.\n\nThen I got to the first actual boss and it all came together. Its got the movement and shooting of doom, the hubworld of zelda games, the humor and style of comix zone.

You can experience it as it was released, or essentially emulated with modern filters for smoothing and design sensibilities, or any personal combo between the both.\n\nIn a day of making games fail proof to ensure no gamer gets left behind, this gamer was delighted to die in an endless wave of enemies because he listened to the first shlomo to give him a quest.", "timestamp_created": 1432487478, "timestamp_updated": 1432487478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551522", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15941083": {"recommendationid": "15941083", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993760296", "num_games_owned": 1891, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432294763}, "language": "english", "review": "98%\n\nI am the sort of person who becomes incredibly enamored with 90's FPSes. Seeing my favourite genre of immersive media in its period of infancy, where the developers were still learning what works and what doesn't... There is just something magical about it, like watching old black and white movies and insisting they're better in every way to the stuff released today.\n\nOf course they aren't. No movie buff is right when they say Kubrick's works outshine the oscarbait we get in our current decade, no photographer is right when they say pictures just look better taken with their analogue sh**boxes. We see the past with rose-tinted glasses because of many factors; nostalgia, passion, auteur admiration, but none of these make the works of the past outright better. I am saying this to quality my recommendation, because Strife was made in 1996; the games industry has had almost 20 years to innovate since this game was released, and as such, as good as the game is, is just can't outshine IPs such as half-life or the elder scrolls series.\n\nThat being said, I now feel comfortable telling you that this game is probably one of the best games I have ever played.\n\nStrife is made on a heavily modified DOOM engine, but it plays closer to 3Drealms' Duke 3D or Shadow Warrior; you can jump, run, fill your inventory with all manner of useful gadgets, and best of all, the game contains the first example of RPG elements in an FPS game; you level up doing sidequests, you can find gold in secret areas to buy additional health packs or ammo, and the game has multiple endings based on a couple of important choices you make as a player. This sort of innovation boggles my mind for 1996, and it's even stranger to me that I had not even heard of this game until a few weeks ago.\n\nThe levels are scattered with secrets, the crux of which being 3 hidden talismans that the game makes you work like a dog for... When you finally get all three, your reward is... Well, I wont spoil it, but it was the most immensely satisfying prize you can imagine without being something inherently game ending. Strife also Gives you the option to stealth through most levels, again, one of the first FPSes that let you do this. The stealth is a little bit confusing, and isn't explained well, but hey, back in those days games came with a manual. Basically, most new areas bad guys wont consider you a threat until you open fire on them. A reasonable reaction, in my opinion. You can stop the alarms going off by killing secluded enemies with silent weapons; daggers or poison darts so that the inevitable dog-pile of enemies becomes easier to manage when they catch you being a twat. You can also... you know... just complete your objective and leave without harming anyone; an option that I doubt many people took in 1996, but an option that is mandatory for the bloodbath difficulty which is as to NIGHTMARE mode what the Holocaust is to a teletubbies marathon. Bloodbath is horrendously difficult. I can finish any level of DOOM on nightmare mode but I cant get out of the first ROOM alive on bloodbath.\n\nThe protagonist has a hardcore sidekick named blackbird who, again, in a profound innovation is the first character I have ever heard say the F-word in a video game (chronologically, I mean), which endeared her to me immediately, her ultimate role is a shoehorned love interest but hey it's the nineties, too much innovation and they would have been burned at the steak. The protagonist himself is a relatively nameless, voiceless link character who travels through 20+ levels with a stunning variety of weapons from the humble bread and butter assault rifle to the double-barreled High-Explosive grenade launcher with optional white phosphorous rounds for when you're feeling frisky. Seriously the grenade launcher is in my top 3 weapons from all games, it is an immensely satisfying, unnecessarily powerful death machine.\n\nThe bosses are good, though the only two worth mentioning are the first boss and the last boss. The first boss is a hectic fast paced battle that I barely survived, the last battle was a wonderfully cinematic ultimatum. All the other bosses get one-shot by the stupid sigil weapon (think soul cube from doom 3). This is probably the only nit-pick I have with this game. The enemies are all astounding, peons, mechs and monsters are all well-rounded and have individual character Bosses, enemies and allies are all competently voice acted, my favourite being the snarky peon administrator who just takes one look at the amount of work you went through cheating yourself into the Order's main HQ, sighs, shrugs and waves you through.\n\nStrife is challenging, rewards exploration and proactive thinking, the levels are well designed, it has character, atmosphere, and a satisfying conclusion with loads of wonderful comic book cutscenes. From 1996, this game is exceptional, and if you adjust for inflation, it is phoenominal.

Placing you into a medieval dystopian setting, you are to use crossbows, missile launchers and machine guns to kill soldiers in metal armor. These medieval soldiers fire back at you with, get this, machine guns. You'll run across space blobs and robotic spiders, too. Head on down to \"Ye Ol' Weapons Shop\" to purchase crossbows and machine gun rounds, or try the armor store next door to buy metal armor so you too can make absolutely no sense, just like your enemies and surroundings.\n\nThis game isn't good by any rules today. I thought Wolfenstein was alright, and the old Duke Nukems were pretty good too. This game was just a failure in an attempt to put FPS into RPG elements. The RPG elements consist of randomly placed NPCs who give you incredibly vague (at least early on) quests. It's very easy to kill someone who could give you a huge quest if you don't talk to them first. On many characters, there are no graphics rendering them different than any other peasant, which means you will have to literally speak to every character on the map in order to find quests properly without a guide.\n\nWhen you speak to these people, a pretty nice cartoon visual of their face will pop up, and then you will hear the voice acting. Oh god, the voice acting made me want to continue playing this game with how laughable it was. You'll walk through medieval times wielding your machine gun, and come upon a peasant with a brooklyn accent who's telling you to get to work before the guards shoot ya.\n\nTL;DR - This game was revolutionary as the first FPS RPG, but revolutionary does not usually go hand-in-hand with good.  This game has poor quests, poor voice actors, and a clunky feel that makes it annoying.

Besides a few new maps, the Veteran Edition doesn't add a whole lot to what you get from the port in terms of gameplay.  It also throws in achievements, trading cards, and a couple of new in-game things (Blackbird chiding the player upon death or quiting; three collectible artifacts).  \n\nStrife is an old-school shooter; it's built on the Doom engine.  It's not a game that holds your hand, though it doesn't throw you out on the street, either.  Several levels are very maze-like and can give inexperienced players problems.  Also, it's not always clear whether it's a good idea to head to an optional area once it's available or progress in the main story first.  I haven't tested it, but it's possible to render the game unwinnable if certain missions are done in the wrong order (I do know that the Veteran Edition removes one specific way of making it unwinnable).  \n\nThe levels are interconnected; with very few exceptions, it's possible to revisit every place you've been whenever you want.  Teleporters make travel a bit easier.  \n\nThe weapons in the game have a nice variety, though the electric bolts are pretty much completely worthless.  It's also quite easy to play through the game and never pick up the Mauler.  In my three playthroughs, I only grabbed it once. It's available in two or three places.  \n\nThe story is strong, with maybe two-dozen voiced characters.  However, the pacing is a bit odd.  Without giving anything away, this game ends rather abruptly.  After accomplishing a key task, you stroll into a structure which you didn't know existed before, fight through a couple of rooms of enemies, confront the final boss, and that's it.  The time between the penultimate task and the boss is five to ten minutes.  \n\nIf playing on harder difficulties, this game can be unforgiving.  It's not that the enemies are mercilessly hard (they're tough, but with only a couple exceptions are not overpowered); rather, it's that the health and ammo which you depend upon are available inconsistently.  It's very easy to find yourself low on supplies and in a tough spot.  Sometimes they're scarce; sometimes there's more than you can carry, forcing you to leave them behind.  You could theoretically backtrack and pick them up again when you need them.  \n\nStrife is a rare example of an FPS/RPG hybrid.  The aforementioned voiced characters are a big part of it.  You can choose text responses in dialogue.  You don't make too many plot altering decisions, though several of them affect what order you perform your tasks.  It's also possible to miss large portions of the game, either through decisions or just not going to certain places.  \n\nOverall, Strife is a very good game.  It has challenge and charm.

It added story, stealth and RPG elements to a genre that, at the time, these elements were new to. \n\nThat said, after playing through it again, I realize that only the early parts of the game (set around the hub of a town occupied by the Order) really stuck in my memory all that clearly. There is a good reason for this: the further you get into the game, the less significant the elements I mentioned earlier which make the game unique really have any effect. By the end, it's just navigating maze-like levels looking for the right switch, mowing down masses of enemies that cross your path with your impressive aresenal of weapons. In other words, it gradually devolves into every other shooter of its time. \n\nAnother issue I have is just how little variety there is. All the enemies - save one type - are either acolytes or robots. Most of the settings are either medieval-style castles or technological settings that could have been pulled out of a contemporary Star Wars game. There's a bit where you first leave town and find yourself in the outskirts, where it looks like you'll get a new kind of outdoor setting. \n\nI still enjoyed playing this game, and played it all the way until the end. But honestly, if you aren't someone who played it back in the day and wants to rekindle memories or whatever, I don't really see the point in playing this.

It's a shame, because it's not only a very good game, it was downright revolutionary.\n\nIt was one of the first shooters to actually have an actual story in the game, instead of being just a mindless slaughterfest, before Half-Life made story in shooters normal. And Strife's plot is actually quite good, at least for its time. The story of the order and its underlying secrets is not really anything special, but it's interesting and, along with the gameplay, can keep you motivated for quite some time. It also uses a twist that would look rather bad or out-of-place in many other games, but works here very well and is foreshadowed enough. On the other hand, the plot can also get confusing and it's not always what exactly happened. It feels like the devs didn't think out the story quite as well, as they should have.\n\nThe characters are... serviceable. Non gets much screentime and development and they only exist to drive the plot forward. The most interesting one is your invisible companion Blackbird, who is quite chatty and lets out many entertaining comments, that sometimes skirt the fourth wall.\n\nAs with any old FPS, the gameplay is the most important part and even Strife is no exception. And as with any old FPS, it's no walk in the park. The enemies take away your health pretty quickly and if you have no healing items (or turned auto-heal off), you can find yourself dead very quickly. On the other hand, healing items are pretty plentiful, so the game isn't too harsh. At least on low-mid difficulties.\n\nThere are also light stealth elements, for which you have two \"silent\" weapons. Very light, though, since it's impossible to finish any area without combat (with on possible exception). For the most part, the purpose is solely to thin out the enemy ranks before the proper fight starts. Other enemies don't care if their companions die near them, expect when they are very close, so that works very well.\n\nAt first, it might look like the game is pretty free, not exactly open-world, but possibly non-linear. This is not the case, though. There is not much you can do aside from your current objectives and attempting to deviate from it can potentially make the game unwinnable (although the Veteran Edition makes it more fair in that regard). There is only one time where you can make a choice that affects the story, but even then there is clearly a \"good\" and a \"bad\" choice.\n\nThere are three endings. Two depend on the aforementioned choice, the last on whether you die in the final battle.\n\nThere are a good amount of weapons in the game and everyone is quite useful in their own right. Two weapons have alternative ammo and another one has an alternative fire mode, effectively increasing the amount of weapons. Also, one is modular and fires differently, depending on how many pieces you have. However, it also uses your health as ammo, so it's use is limited (mostly to enemies that can only be hurt by it).\n\nThe presentation is pretty much what one would expect from a 90's shooter in the Doom engine. It's 2.D, 3D but with 2D sprites for characters, items, decorations and pretty much everything that isn't the map itself and very pixelated. The music is MIDI only, which is a rather mixed thing. The songs itself are good, though. Important (and a few not so important) NPCs are presented with big portraits in a comic style, which are pretty well-done. They are also voiced, which is a mixed bag. Generally, the voice acting isn't very good, but the way it tends to be overdone and hammy is actually pretty entertaining. The best one is the aforementioned Blackbird, who has a pretty pleasing voice. Which is good, because you'll hear it the entire time.\n\nThe Veteran Edition improves the visuals with widescreen support and additional effects. Especially Bloom enhances the graphics a lot and makes it kinda hard to go back to \"vanilla\" Strife.\n\nI can recommend this game to everyone who likes first-person shooters, especially old ones.

They've smoothed out many  of the rough elements of the original Strife, added some useful/cool new features, and generally done a great job at making Strife look and play better without really touching the game itself.\n\nHere's a few of the improvements:\n\n[list]\n[*]High-resolution 3D-accelerated rendering engine with tweakable settings for pretty much everything. I think the bloom filter defaults are pretty good, but whatever your preference is, you can set it. You can even select the original software renderer if you want the old Doom engine look.\n[*]Important quest items are now highlighted with a flashing outline when enemies drop them.\n[*]Major mission objectives now have waypoints marked on the map screen.\n[*]I've only tested controller support with a wired Xbox 360 controller, but man does it work well.\n[*]An unused UI element for the secondary fire mode of the Mauler has been implemented. This makes the immediate distinction between fire modes a lot clearer.\n[*]The original soundtrack can be played back in either a tinny-but-classic FM-chip version, or a superior pre-recorded MIDI version using good instrument samples.\n[/list]\n\nAs for the game itself, Strife is a FPS/RPG hybrid with a heavy leaning towards the former. The FPS elements are interesting in that several of the weapons can hurt you if you're not careful - especially the grenade launcher and secondary fire mode of the Mauler. If you learn to use the weapons effectively, however, they can make you feel like a total badass. You cannot stealth through the whole game, but many areas allow you to get through with minimal killing if you'd like, and one achievement is based around doing this in a specific area.\n\nThe plot involves a couple of twists that you may or may not see coming. There's a couple of major areas that only open up if you take the path to the \"Good\" ending, and one or two that you can just simply miss by not exploring the levels enough.\n\nThe RPG elements of Strife involve branching NPC dialogue trees, (optional) upgrades to accuracy and health, and 3 different endings. This is nothing special today, but at the time, nobody had put all those features into a FPS, let alone a Doom engine game. The spoken dialogue is variable in quality - some characters are believable, others a little over-the-top. Thankfully, it's all way above the quality of many other old-school games.\n\nYou have essentially a running commentary from Blackbird (a female NPC who talks to you via your comm unit) throughout most of the game. It's a great idea that often helps to give the game some personality, as well as a reminder of where you need to go next.\n\nThen, there's the secrets. Holy heck are there a lot of secrets in this game. I discovered a few secret areas here and there in my original playthroughs, and was pretty satisfied with myself. When I went about trying to get the \"Completionist\" achievement in this version, I noticed that many of the secrets I knew didn't even count towards the total. I'm now pretty humbled. To be fair, some of the secrets are not at all obvious, and some basically require bumping into/trying to open every square inch of every level [(The transparent wall secrets are some of the worst offenders in this category)]. Also, Night Dive *added* some secrets to this version of Strife, most notably the Talismans (which are a seperate accheivement). I'm currently running through the game specifically trying to find every secret without consulting a walkthrough. It's not easy.\n\nOkay, so there's also some stuff that doesn't hold up so well:\n\nBlackbird often comments on NPC dialogue - but sometimes she doesn't start talking until at least a second after the NPC's line has finished. If you're used to rushing through dialogue trees, you might miss about half of her lines. I can't remember if this was in the original game or not, but in this version a line of text will show up in the saying \"Blackbird is listening\", which lets you know she's going to comment after the NPC finishes talking.\n\nThe graphics are kind of blocky. This version has done a nice job of subtly filtering textures once they get a certain distance from the player, but this is still a Doom engine game. Thankfully, the overall art design is colorful and far from the bland color schemes of more recent FPSs.\n\nThe music is variable in quality, with some tunes adding to the intensity of combat [spoiler] especially the castle assault[/spoiler], and some becoming incredible repetitive after a while; the music in the sewer levels is especially grating (pun not intended).\n\nWhile the lack of handholding in finding mission objectives is a nice change from modern games, there are some levels where it's very easy to get lost and not know what to do/where to go next. The objective waypoints on the map screen are a nice addition, but the markers are totally static and don't clear when individual objectives are achieved.\n\nThe multiplayer is limited to your Steam friends. This is great if you have several friends who like to play Strife, but it would be nice to have the option to play with strangers as well. Yes, I do also understand that dedicated servers are expensive to run.\n\nOverall, this is easily the best \"re-release with enhancements\" I've played, and really helps to show folks what a cool, underappreciated gem Strife was/is.", "timestamp_created": 1424118398, "timestamp_updated": 1465923588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.638766", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14413253": {"recommendationid": "14413253", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966476263", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509424618}, "language": "english", "review": "This game, much like doom, was a defining title for me in PC gaming.

The only thing missing is leveling, but money replaces experience ;)\n\nTHE GOOD (7):\n-Extremely tight controls! If you've played DOOM (which I'll reference a lot), you know how Strife plays exactly! This style of control doesn't exist for shooters anymore and it's too bad because the gameplay is quick and exciting. You'll never get frustrated at the controls :)\n-Great story production! Although I'm not very far in the game so I'm not sure about the overall plot, but the game has full voiceover work and even has some cutscenes presented as a stylish comic-book!\n-Multiple endings! I still haven't gotten a chance to beat it, but I read online that there's at least 3 different endings (probably more), and when is that ever a bad thing?\n-Cool Quests! The questing is never more than what it should be. \"Go to this area and turn this switch off\" or \"go kill this guy for some cash\". That's all I want and expect from this type of game and it gives incentive to explore some side maps :)\n-The main town! This might seem tiny, but I really like the town! Guards (which are enemies on any other map) won't shoot you, and so long as you don't start killing people at random, you can relax and shop at your leisure.\n-Shops provide ammunation and in some cases new weapons, so you'll be hard pressed to run through the game without ammo, but don't go shooting walls randomly ;)\n-Surprisingly long. I still haven't found time to beat it! After the first boss (which took me a very long time to get to), I thought it was the end of the game. Instead I was presented with a strange new weapon and told that \"there's 4 more pieces to that weapon\", so I guess there's 4 more bosses!\n\nTHE BAD (3):\n-The music is pretty lame and sometimes outright annoying. It had me laughing and I love how cheesey it is, but the music is bad XD\n-Keeping track of quests can be a bit tricky. This version of the game has added the ability to see quests on your map, this is great! But the icons pointing you where to go won't disappear once you've completed one part of the quest. It will point to the quest giver and the objective at all times, adding more icons for quests that require you to visit multiple locations. Often I found myself backtracking to an area marked on my map only to find I'd already finished that part.\n-Sewers. Once you get to this part, you'll know what I mean.\n\nIf you'd like to see the game in action, here's my First Look :)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY5R7HDmupk\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nWhat can I say? The Original Strife: Veteran Edition is a tight game that any DOOM fan will love! Most other reviews talk about how Strife was overlooked because at the time there were some huge game releases. \nI'm glad I was able to pick this one up :)\n\n-Thanks for taking the time to read this review!

Strife finally marks its comeback in a more modern and accessible package for both fans old and new.\n\nMost importantly, this is an incredibly solid port that is consistent with the quality you'd expect from Night Dive and then some. All modern resolutions are included here as well as graphical improvements in the form of dynamic lighting, bloom, and customizable motion blur. Controls have been tweaked to fit the playstyle of modern shooters, and objectives now glow with a circle on the minimap creating a much smoother and seamless quest hunt. Night Dive Studios has given Strife all of the needed customization to allow players of any background enjoy the game however they please, be it in its original intended form or with all the new bells and whistles.\n\nAn extraterrestrial meteorite strikes your planet, unleashing a mysterious virus ravaging the brains of those it infects. Society has been split into two, the infected who have become cruel and barbaric rulers over the uninfected and powerless civilians. You are one of the uninfected who have banded together to create their own rebel community and fight this infected authority that reigns over your lives known only as The Order.\n\nStrife features a large and detailed town hub unlike any FPS before it due to its population of many colorful, grizzled citizens and their connected questlines with fully voiced dialogue trees, the exploration within this community feeling fluid and engaging even after all these years. Here you've got all the staple establishments used throughout the RPG medium. The tavern provides you with side quests to perform for cash as well as tidbits of valuable info that comes at a price, the hospital sells valuable potions to heal during combat, and the weapon and armor shop sell the valuable equipment needed to advance through the harder levels found throughout the world.\n\nOnce you've met up with your underground resistance group of rebels the game opens up, as you take quests and carry out important mission from the various NPCs you'll find scattered around the sprawling town. Different strongholds and hidden corridors throughout the outskirts of the town play host to these missions following classic FPS action, and will reward you with scavenged loot and money in the form of quest rewards to purchase new equipment or much needed medical kits before delving into newer, harder territory.\n\nWhile it certainly isn't the first FPS/RPG hybrid to ever be created, I feel it was the best original attempt to really get it right with a user friendly combination of addictive RPG progression within a fast and furious world of Doom-like violence. Fans of the engine and of the era in general will be drawn to the reminiscent visuals and their application to a unique fantasy world, an extremely pleasant departure from the usual bleak and gray environments we're used to from shooters of that period. The nostalgic Roland powered music is especially delightful here, and takes an extremely adventurous turn in composition.\n\ntl;dr\nIf you've never played Strife there is no better time to discover and enjoy a legend, and if you're an old fan of Strife this is the perfect excuse to go back and experience it again in its most polished form to date.", "timestamp_created": 1421447698, "timestamp_updated": 1421448073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.744142", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13959782": {"recommendationid": "13959782", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998900677", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421085447}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, didn't played it when it originally came out in 1996.

I used to watch my brothers play these games as I was too young to play them myself. Of all these games Strife seemed most boreing of these all games for me back then, since it had so much RPG elements like talking to people etc., not non-stop action like Doom, Heretic and Hexen.\nIt was until many years later, I was much older when I started to appreciate this game and like it, as I started to play it myself and got more into RPG stuff in general too.

Though very difficult, if you like games such as System Shock 2 or Deus Ex, Strife is an excellent example of the genre fusion well before anything else was done. And it's worth picking up if you like retro shooters in general.[/h1]\n\nI love Strife. I love the engine, the overworld, the shooting, the secrets, everything. It's one of those games that just reeks of originality and ingenuity that it's hard to even come to grips with the fact that it disappeared off the face of the planet shortly after it was released. The Veteran Edition, led by Night Dive Studios, is not only a faithful port of the original game, but also offers a re-done version that fixes up a lot of bugs, adds an unfinished game mode to it, and makes the Doom engine look brand spanking new. And it's glorious.\n\nStrife came out in 1996, a month before Quake was released. Graphically, it definitely was overshadowed by Quake. The Doom engine could pull off some amazingly large locations and have tonnes of enemies on screen, but Quake was in full 3D, and it looked amazing (and also the level design was ridiculously good too). Strife faded into obscurity as Quake basically became the hall-mark for FPS standards.\n\nStrife is mostly a first-person shooter: you move around, shoot bad guys, and walk around a map completing objectives. It had an inventory system similar to Heretic or Hexen before it, where health packs and other gadgets could be used. It had a bunch of weapons that could be used, and, in the retro shooter fashion, were completely explosive and amazing. My favourite has to be the grenade launcher, which fires two giant bombs forward, which explode into a tower of fiery death. There's also a secondary ammo for that weapon which fires napalm, and man is it devastating.\n\nHowever, it also had a few RPG mechanics thrown in. Firstly, the entire game was a persistent overworld: you start in a main hub, and every level branches off from that, interacting with each other as the game goes on. Military bases become overrun, pathways open up between areas, and so on. You can also talk to almost every human character in the game. While a lot of them don't say anything useful, a few give some nice tips on fighting enemies or navigating the levels. Quite a number of NPCs are voice acted, and it definitely brings the game some life.\n\nOn top of that, levels have a lot of secrets involved with them. With the Veteran Edition, there are 16 that are marked and count towards an achievement (which honestly is not that many), but there are definitely a lot of other hidden away areas that include items, rewarding the player for keeping an eye out for inconsistencies in the level. One kind of secret actually increases your maximum health and makes your weapons more accurate, which is a nice way to reward the player rather than giving a bunch of ammo.\n\nThe story will leads you around a bunch of locations around the world. While it gives the illusion of an open-world game, it's really linear, as you're expected to clear off levels in a specific order. However, quite a few areas allow the player to approach it from different angles, similar to Deus Ex. For a lot of levels, stealth is an option. While the player, in a few areas, can walk around without guards attacking, robots will always hunt the player down, so stealth is more about avoiding enemies than trying to take out each of them one at a time. When stealth goes, the game doesn't make you feel like you've messed up, as your weapons are more than capable of taking down enemies (although on higher difficulties the number of enemies gets ridiculous). A few areas in the game do get quite ridiculous though in terms of irritating enemy placement or level design, but overall there's a lot of good stuff.\n\nA lot of the enemies attack with hitscan-like weapons (or projectiles that move very fast). This can get a bit annoying and can contribute to a lot of deaths in the game. Again, fortunately in the Veteran Edition, a little blip comes up on the screen indicating where you are getting hit from, which makes it easier to react to them. Because of these enemies, your playstyle will move towards a more cautionary stance rather than running in rooms guns blazing. It's an interesting change of pace, but it does get a bit annoying when you die very quickly. Fortunately, hitscanning enemies are also the weaker enemies in the grand scheme of things (akin to Doom), which makes it not as cheap as it could be.\n\nThe story has you up against a few bosses, each one harder than the last. They also require to be hit with the ultimate weapon of the game: the Sigil, which upgrades its damage output and attack style after each boss is defeated. The Sigil uses the player's health as ammo, and it provides an interesting dynamic for the fights: where survivability is more crucial than before.\n\nStrife also has a couple of different endings, and, fortunately, it isn't just a different button at the end of the final room of the game. The endings are determined in the last third of the game, and it changes the course of where you go and such. It's interesting to see a game from almost 20 years ago do this and many other elements so well compared to more modern games.\n\nThe Veteran Edition release not only fixes the original game's bugs, but it also offers the original game as a bonus which is nice. It also uses a fancy OpenGL version of the Chocolate Strife port, which offers bloom and dynamic lighting, but, again, there is an option to use the software renderer and make the game look as old as it originally did. Also the multiplayer is nice and chaotic as most retro shooters seemed to be. However, the player-base is not quite there yet, so it's hard to get into a match.\n\nHowever, of course, the game not only includes support for modding, but it's compatible with a bunch of mods that were made back in 1996. While not as extensive as some other games at the time, there's a lot of good stuff that came out of the modding community back then, which will definitely extend the game's life cycle.\n\nIf you play Strife, you have to remember that it came out in 1996: well before any other shooter RPG hybrid that was big and popular. And it's sad just how amazing this game was. The Veteran Edition release is very faithful in making the game run well on modern systems, as well as making it compatible with older content. The $10 price point is well worth the content. Strife is a magnificent game, and you'll definitely like it if you're into retro shooters or shooter-RPG hybrids in general, or if you just want to play a hard as nails old school game.\n\n[h1][b]RATING: 3 UP, 1 DOWN[/b][/h1]\n[i]My up/down rating system tries to differentiate between games that are mediocre (less ups and downs total), and games that are interesting but flawed (more ups and downs totals).

THERE IS A SPOILER PRESENT! You won't know if you have never played this game before and if that doesn't bother you, disregard but I have so it's obvious to me.)\n\nMany, many, many moons ago, I played a demo of an ad hoc Doom-meets-Zelda game on my cousin's PC. Many, many, moons after (early 2007), when I accrued the cash to buy my own PC and a month or two after that when our house got the Internet, I stumbled across a website named Abandonia which served as a threshold for some of the long forgotten classics of yesteryear, most of which were, as they are today, long out of print. Well, that unusual title happened to be amongst its collective and after a little while struggling to get my head around the Metroid Prime of the mid-90s, a lot of fun and a lot of happy hours were spent playing through it.\n\nOf course, the game in question is Strife and a few more moons later, I discover that a refurbished edition is on sale in the Steam store at a price which slots in at well under ten gold. Needless to say, the cash was parted as a great game is always worth its weight in gold (or something)! As has been said, it's a first-person shooter in the vein of Doom (particularly as it uses the Doom engine) but with a twist: instead of making cold meat pies out of everyone and everything, there are Zelda/Final Fantasy/Shadowrun-like elements of exploration, character interaction and even some (very loose) stealth elements. More on that in a tick.\n\nYou start off much as you do in Wolfenstein 3D, in a small room with just you and a guard (acolyte) albeit with no weapon other than a spike attached to your glove. He takes a few punches, but you'll do away with him easily enough. Immediately after exiting the room, and after executing another acolyte, you find yourself in a dystopic village, an unusual hybrid of medieval setting, not unlike Hyrule Castle in Ocarina Of Time, mixed with a futuristic sci-fi world. A small room on the left brings you to a well-spoken character named Rowan, who's vaguely aware of you and what's just happened, and reckons you're just what a friend of his named Macil, the leader of a resistance movement known as The Front (such imaginative names, guys!), needs for their force. After doing a quick chore to prove your allegiance, you're on your way. Sort of.\n\nYou start off by acquiring a 'companion', a voice from someone named Blackbird: a tough, headstrong lass who lets you know the score. But there's also a strand of charm to her and a sense of humour and you'll find that she's a very pleasant companion and keeps you interested. After a small bit of espionage, chatting to the barkeep and a couple of patrons at the pub (and another guy, more on that to follow) to get an idea of the place and what's going on, it's time to meet Macil and be sworn into the ranks of the front. There's an option to refuse, as there is when Rowan first asks you, but it's not an option that's conducive if you wish to live. He gives you your first lot of tasks, one of which involves dealing with the Sepp Blatter-like Govenor who's happy to turn a blind eye provided he gets paid. It's all going well..... for now.\n\nBut I digress. It all sounds very deep for a game of this ilk and you're right, because it is or at least is by 1996's standards. It's a shooter with a resonating storyline which twists and turns depending on the choices you make whilst playing it. You're out to get the bad guys but unlike its older, Mars-based cousin, you can't go out all guns blazing, you have to think and get a feel for your surroundings, decide what to do and how you do it. Hence the element of stealth, which though extremely inconsistent (as you'll later find out), has to be used and maintained especially in the village and Commons. The gameplay is vastly improved from the original title, which has a smoother framerate and superior resolution in addition to the standard WSAD/mouse control for FPS games as opposed to the fiddly keyboard controls of old (which never stopped me playing, mind). Movement is better, action is more fluid and for me, it takes the edge off of the difficulty a little bit - and this game is tough! Also, as has perhaps been insinuated, there are no levels as such - you go between the different areas of the game, which totals about a dozen with sub-areas to some, as and when you need to.\n\nThe paths you traipse and the ending you receive when you're done depend on your decision-making when interacting with specific characters, which usually involves taking their word for it 'cos as there's no real incling to what might happen before you go one way or the other, wisdom does not come quite as conducive. For instance, one of the first missions you receive is optional: a crooked Mafia-esque businessman named Harris who asks you to steal the chalice holed up in the Sanctuary in exchange for riches. Other than his voice actor's DeNiro-like tone which gives you the notion that he sounds dodgy, there's no real evidence he'll lead you to a trap which he does, and that sets the town's acolytes on top of you. Yes, that's a spoiler but trust me, it's one you'll want.\n\nOf course, no game is without its flaws and Strife is no exception, suffering the fate of many other titles of that era. There are a lot of graphically-inept maze-like passages from A to B to C to D with a lot of deja-vu moments (wittingly remarked upon by Blackbird on a few occasions) and even though this version highlights the points of interest on the map for you, it can be frustrating getting to them, sometimes even requiring to exit the area and find another entrance in another part of the game (as the areas are interconnected). The AI is very ropey, as it was in nearly all games up until about ten years ago, which would be fine in most other FPS games but not one where interacting with the enemy and often being forced to keep a low profile are required to progress. And when you do have to fight them - stuff like cyborgs, robot spheres, mechanical spiders and ED-209s - they are quite tough and they take a lot of hits, hitting hard themselves. Add to that they are profuse in numbers and ubiquitous in each area and though the game isn't too stingy on health and ammo refills, there are points where you'll find yourself stuck for one or the other and even both. I'd advise keeping two or three save files, particularly if you're playing on any difficulty past and inclusive of Veteran 'cos you might have to end up doing an entire segment again.\n\nAs with something that little bit different than expected, Strife is an unexpected pleasure. A blaster with a storyline, a world to explore and characters who speak is a very refreshing concept, even now almost 20 years after its release. It's not a game for everyone: if you like your shooters to be more about the killing, stick with Doom, Blood or Duke Nukem 3D. But if the likes of Goldeneye or Mass Effect (not great comparisons, I'll admit) whet your appetite and you can put up with the odd bit of RPG-style roadblocking, you'll find a kindred spirit with this underrated, overlooked and very original classic.

As a result, people pretty much forgot it existed. It's a remarkably ground-breaking non-linear FPSRPG that kind of shattered contemporary conventions, long before the days of Far Cry, Borderlands or Destiny (but following in the footsteps of 1993's Pathways into Darkness and 1994's System Shock).\n\nNotably, all copies of its source code were completely lost and so, modern versions of the game running on source ports rely on reverse-engineering. That's where the Veteran Edition comes in, and it's clear that a lot of care has gone into crafting it. Not only have you got modern OS support, customizable keybinds, along with bells and whistles like bloom, motion blur, high-res textures and so on, but you've also got the original version of the game for purists or curious folk and, on top of that, the reconstruction of unfinished features in the original game, which is pretty damn neat.\n\nThe game itself holds up remarkably well to this day. It's far from the highly immersive, airtight, diegetic experiences from nowadays, but exploring it and making gradual progress through the world feels incredibly rewarding. Gameplay is fun and challenging, and the world itself looks pretty good and most environments offer a good sense of realism and sense of purpose. \n\nIn a lot of ways, it feels like a lot more than just an underrated game from 1996; it's distinctly ahead of its time and so, playing it feels totally unlike a step backwards in any way.

I've had to re-acquaint myself with mid-'90s era FPS rules, though (I'll get to that in a bit).\n\nFirst off, the postitives, sans nostalgia:\n\n- Good quest system. You talk to people, join a faction, do the quests, get rewards. No EXP for increases in health or accuracy, those are some of the rewards. Simple.\n\n- The level design is great. There are multiple ways to approach a goal, and each will change how things play out (sneak in the back door and you don't have to fight off the entire city)\n\n- Your choices matter, and you can make a wrong choice. It always bothers me in a game where I supposedly have any choice possible that I can't kill the big baddie right in front of me, even if it breaks a quest.\n\n- Fantastic voice acting, for the most part. A couple minor voiced NPCs are a bit... odd. Not terrible, just a bit \"...interesting choice...\" \n\n- You can name your saves, and make multiple saves. Again, many modern games don't even let you manually save. I like to be able to know what I was doing in X save at Y time. I have a sheet of paper to keep track of my Skyrim characters -_-\n\nCons: \n\n-If I have my screen set to a resolution lower than the resolution set in the game, it doesn't start (Linux). I'll report this bug at some point. It's not a big deal. I just forgot to set it higher after playing something else once.\n\n- The movement is slippery and floaty. That's accurate to the time it was made, but after playing newer games for so long (though I did start on Wolfenstein 3D) it's a bit rough to go back to this. Not a huge deal, though.\n\n- No real cue as to whether guards are hostile before they start shooting.\n\n- Mouse settings are bizarre. If you turn off mouse acceleration, you lose all mouse movement. Had to balance 3 sliders in 2 menus until I got something useful.  EDIT: Hours after posting this review, the mouse issue was fixed. Very cool.\n\n- Nearly all the NPCs look the same. Can be confusing. Luckily we have the quest markers in this version.\n\nThese are NOT cons! Just things to remember when you start playing, as this game was made in 1995-96:\n\n- This game does _not_ auto-save. If you don't save, you will lose all progress. Happened to me a few times already with me facepalming at my stupidity. It just has so many concepts used in more modern games, I forget!\n\n- Looking up/down does NOT equal aiming up/down. It's convenient in that you can see what's shooting at you, but this is basically DooM, and looking up/down didn't exist back then. Perhaps turning off Classic Mode will change this, but I think I'll stick with this, personally. Really make that Accuracy stat mean something ;)\n\n- All in all, this game holds up pretty dang well. More playable than Daggerfall, I can say that much (and I think I've put a hundred hours or more into Daggerfall this past year. Just saying that this has aged far better. I think I'd say the same even if it were running in the original engine!).\n\nThe greater story depth makes me think it might have aged better than DooM itself!

Desarrollado por la extinta compa\u00f1\u00eda [i]Rogue Entertainment[/i], [b]Strife[/b] tuvo la mala fortuna de publicarse unas pocas semanas antes del lanzamiento de [b]Quake[/b], en Mayo de 1996. Trat\u00e1ndose de un juego que utilizaba la misma tecnolog\u00eda gr\u00e1fica de [b]DooM[/b], la potencia lograda por [i]id[/i] con el sucesor de su genial FPS provoc\u00f3 que [b]Strife[/b] luciera ya primitivo para entonces. Al final, [b]Quake[/b] acapar\u00f3 la atenci\u00f3n de los jugadores de la \u00e9poca, mientras que el trabajo de [i]Rogue[/i] pas\u00f3 injustamente desapercibido... \n\nEn cuanto a gameplay, [b]Strife[/b] sigue un esquema parecido al de [b]HeXeN[/b], pero un tanto m\u00e1s avanzado. El juego se desarrolla como una mezcla de FPS con algunos aspectos menores de RPG, implementando un sistema de experiencia (dividido en dos tipos: resistencia y exactitud para nuestras armas), inventario, la posibilidad de di\u00e1logos con los NPC (gran parte de ellos cuentan inclusive con voces, algo inusual en los juegos de Primera Persona de su tiempo) o diferentes estrategias para terminar cada misi\u00f3n. En dado momento, ser\u00e1 necesario llevar a cabo una elecci\u00f3n que acabar\u00e1 definiendo el resto del juego, misma que podr\u00e1 llevarnos a obtener uno de los tres finales disponibles (los cuales podemos clasificar como \u201cMalo\u201d, \u201cNeutral\u201d y \u201cBueno/Verdadero\u201d). \n\nComo en [b]HeXeN[/b], los mapas de [b]Strife[/b] se dividen en \u201chubs\u201d, unidos por un nivel central en el que, poco a poco, tendremos acceso a diferentes zonas, al igual que varias misiones optativas. Sobre las armas, \u00e9stas son las t\u00edpicas de un FPS (cuchillo, rifle de asalto, lanzagranadas, ballesta, etc...); algunas  tienen modo de fuego alterno, con una que otra sorpresa que prefiero no arruinarles.  Podr\u00e1 apreciarse que, aunque dista de llegar al nivel de complejidad que unos pocos a\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde ofrecer\u00edan [b]Deus Ex[/b] o [b]Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines[/b], la esencia del g\u00e9nero de FPS/RPG ya est\u00e1 presente en [b]Strife[/b].\n\nA pesar de ello, y tal como mencion\u00e9 en un principio, este gran juego termin\u00f3 casi ignorado tras su lanzamiento. El tiempo no cambi\u00f3 mucho el panorama: en comparaci\u00f3n de [b]Heretic[/b], [b]HeXeN[/b] o -por supuesto- [b]DooM[/b], fueron pocos los jugadores que tuvieron la suerte de conocer a [b]Strife[/b], y menos todav\u00eda los que llegaron a contar con una copia. Parte de la comunidad Doomera se dedic\u00f3 a preservar a su memoria, no obstante, con la publicaci\u00f3n de [i]Source Ports[/i] para ejecutarlo en equipos modernos (como [b]GZDooM[/b]), adem\u00e1s de algunos mapas realizados por fan\u00e1ticos. Dada la desaparici\u00f3n de [i]Rogue Entertainment[/i] en 2001 y la p\u00e9rdida del c\u00f3digo fuente del juego, [b]Strife[/b] parec\u00eda destinado a ser un t\u00edtulo \u201cmoderadamente\u201d recordado\u2026 pero su historia no iba a terminar as\u00ed como as\u00ed.\n\nCasi 20 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, la compa\u00f1\u00eda [i]Night Dive[/i] ha realizado lo que a muchos se nos antojaba casi imposible: recuperar los derechos de [b]Strife[/b] y publicar el juego de manera digital en [i]Steam[/i]. Sin embargo, no se han conformado con realizar un simple \u201cbundle\u201d del juego con una versi\u00f3n en [i]DosBox[/i] (como pas\u00f3 con el resto de los juegos del engine [b]DooM[/b]). Al igual que [i]Devolver Digital[/i] realiz\u00f3 con [b]Duke Nukem 3D[/b] y [b]Shadow Warrior[/b], la [b]Veteran Edition[/b] de [b]Strife[/b] es toda una actualizaci\u00f3n del t\u00edtulo original para los sistemas modernos: el juego cuenta ya con las principales caracter\u00edsticas que pueden ser encontradas en los FPS contempor\u00e1neos, comenzando -para mencionar algunas- por el soporte de mouse y gamepads, diferentes resoluciones, detalles gr\u00e1ficos como el uso de [i]motion blur[/i], [i]lightmaps[/i], luces din\u00e1micas y brillo, adem\u00e1s de otros aspectos menores que el jugador quisquilloso podr\u00e1 calificar de superfluos, pero que -honestamente- no pueden dejar de agradecerse (como la inclusi\u00f3n de Logros, cosa que alegrar\u00e1 a los entusiastas de completar los mismos al 100%). Aunque algunas de dichas caracter\u00edsticas ya pod\u00edan obtenerse con el uso de [i]Source Ports[/i], la [b]Veteran Edition[/b] de [b]Strife[/b] las incluye por defecto. No es necesario conseguir programas adicionales ni modificar los archivos del juego: todo est\u00e1 listo para que podamos ejecutarlo con la m\u00ednima configuraci\u00f3n de nuestra parte. \n\n[b]Veteran Edition[/b] incluye tambi\u00e9n cuatro nuevos niveles, junto con la demo original (gracias a la cual muchos conocimos el juego en su momento) de [b]Strife[/b]. Para el nost\u00e1lgico, est\u00e1 disponible el \u201cClassic Mode\u201d, mismo que promete la experiencia m\u00e1s cercana al [b]Strife[/b] de 1996, inclusive con los mismos bugs. Ah, \u00a1claro!: tambi\u00e9n se ha implementado ya el modo multijugador, con el cl\u00e1sico [i]Deathmatch[/i] y [i]Capture the Flag[/i]. En lo personal, me inclino m\u00e1s por los juegos en solitario, pero tengo la seguridad de que la inclusi\u00f3n de multiplayer ser\u00e1 una estupenda noticia para un gran n\u00famero de lectores. No todo es perfecci\u00f3n, por supuesto... Como \u00fanico detalle negativo, advierto que el juego cuenta con auto-aim, mismo que no puede ser desactivado (algo natural en los FPS de los 90, pero ya innecesario en la actualidad). Afortunadamente, un miembro del equipo de [i]Night Dive[/i] ha mencionado que se buscar\u00e1 la forma de dejar dicho aspecto a elecci\u00f3n del jugador, aplic\u00e1ndose (esperemos) en un futuro patch.\n\nCreo que no puedo decir mucho m\u00e1s; [b]Strife: Veteran Edition[/b] es, en definitiva, una verdadera carta de amor para los que disfrutamos de la obra maestra de [i]Rogue Entertainment[/i] en el pasado. Puedo recomendarlo para cualquier jugador que guste de los FPS o que tenga inter\u00e9s en descubrir a un cl\u00e1sico olvidado del g\u00e9nero. Si has jugado [b]Strife[/b] con anterioridad, el estupendo trabajo realizado por [i]Night Dive[/i] es la excusa perfecta para recorrerlo de nuevo. De otra forma, si nunca has tenido la oportunidad de disfrutar de este gran t\u00edtulo\u2026 pues aqu\u00ed la tienes. \n\n\u00bfVas a dejarla pasar?", "timestamp_created": 1419131621, "timestamp_updated": 1479924902, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.805911", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13466376": {"recommendationid": "13466376", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990484397", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419873977}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought it because I never finished the original.

Released in 1996, Strife pushed the limits by offering a FPS that didn't involve shooting everything sight. In fact, it was well possible to screw up your game having to start all over by doing something you weren't supposed to.\n\nThe Veteran Edition does its best to bring Strife into the 21st century, luckily. As revolutionary as the game was in 1996, it still had quite a few flaws including only having a single save game. In a game where it's possible to make a wrong move and only finding out half an hour later, this was painful so due to the Veteran Edition having several save games, it starts off by eliminating the biggest flaw of the original.\n\nAnother annoyance from the first game, was its vague mission parameters combined with maze-like locations (like the sewers). While you have a detailed map, you could still get lost for ages. The Veteran Edition helps you out by marking quest locations - another welcome improvement.\n\nBesides these gameplay tweaks, you have the standard graphic and control improvements including fluent mouse look, bloom, higher resolution graphics, proper shading, etc. \n\nWhile Strife won't blow your socks off if you compare it to modern games, it's still a rare gem.

How did games devolve from this into brown/gray, linear, cinematic slogfests that play themselves? \n\nStrife is an FPS-RPG hybrid which is said to be one of the original games of the like, set in a world ruled by a tyrannous cult known as The Order in which you play part of a rebellion which plots to overthrow them. The game itself plays like a mixture of DooM and Duke 3D with fast paced combat that relies heavily on maneuverability/skill and the missions in Strife are open ended which allow for a lot of freedom and exploration. \n\nThis has got to be one of the best looking games I've ever played to this day, it has tons of rich colours and the textures all fit perfectly with each other instead of the monotonous garbage that passes off for games these days that consist only of disgustingly bland mixtures of brown and gray. The sound is great, the weapons feel heavy and powerful and the game is complimented by what has to be one of the most badass soundtracks in gaming.\n\nStrife is definitely worth the 9.99 asking price (currently 7.49 on sale) given that it is a complete masterpiece in every regard.

Yes, it was overshadowed by other classics that year but this game has aged well and is even a little remastered. As of now, buy it.

This description still doesn't do the game full justice, but it's a good way to at least categorize it.\n\nI've re-played the original game during the Christmas holidays in 2010 and thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. The comic-style artwork and the voice acting really reminds me of the style of the classic adventure game \"Beneath a Steel Sky\", the faction of The Order feels like a high-tech version of the Hammers from the \"Thief\" trilogy (by the way: \"Thief 2014\" doesn't exist...) and the open world has a very unique feel to it. It offers a nice opportunity to experiment a bit with choices and outcomes. Getting your secret \"underground rebellion missions\" via in-ear radio feels really immersive, too!\n\nThankfully, this updated Veteran Edition doesn't change the original too much. Just a very comfortable new Full HD engine with complete mouse look, high quality textures, dynamic lighting and bloom and a rich variety of options to customize the game to your liking. Oh, and Steam achievements, too.\n\nThis was an instant buy \u2013 and I wholeheartedly recommend this game!\nGo buy it.

It's EASILY the best game released using Doom Engine. It feels almost like an earlier version of Deus Ex with its post apocalyptic cyberpunk inspired setting that has you running around a city hub taking & completeing jobs for various NPC in the game while finding, earning, & buying upgrades for your character & his arsenal. Its a damn shame it had to drop a month before the likes of Quake. Thanks to this almost no one has ever heard of it, and it was doomed (no pun intended) to launguish in relative obscurity never recieving the recognition it deserved. Believe it or not, this is the game that pioneered interactive AI allies & ingame storytelling in an FPS, things Half-Life was later was credited for.

The game is built more like an RPG with mission based objectives. You play as a wandering mercenary who joins the resistance toward a corrupt government of cyborgs known as The Order. All of the characters in the game are really memorable and really well voice acted. It also features multiple endings, and overall the story is really engaging. Especially for a game released in 1996 with comic book cutscenes.\n\nStrife also features hub levels like Hexen, where you revisit a central town location regularly to purchase ammunition and health items prior to a mission. The game also takes place in an interconnected world similar to Metroid. Where you can backtrack to prior mission areas if you so desire to uncover secrets you might have missed. Later on in the game the levels get much more sprawling and the level design in general gets more unique.\n\nStrife is one of my favorite fps/rpg games. While it wasn't the first one to try the concept, it was probably the first one to do it really well. It's a very enjoyable and simple game to play and if you're a fan of games like Deus Ex and System Shock I guarantee you'll like it.\n\nThis re-release also includes the original WAD files that Strife shipped with back in 1996. So if you're not a fan of this particular port of the game, you can copy those into your favorite Doom source port like gzDoom or Skulltag. Happy hunting.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=355314412", "timestamp_created": 1418458799, "timestamp_updated": 1435245355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.749344", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13340373": {"recommendationid": "13340373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000992256", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454079606}, "language": "russian", "review": "IMO, \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0420\u041f\u0413/\u0424\u041f\u0421 \u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440. \u041d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446-\u0442\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442. \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0430 \u0441 \u0431\u0443\u0431\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0432\u044b\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e - \u0438\u0437 \u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e-\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b. \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \"\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\" \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0432 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0432 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435 \u043f\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043a \u0432 \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e, \u0442\u0435, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430, \u0441\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0432\u0440\u044f\u0434 \u043b\u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0442 \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c)", "timestamp_created": 1418456258, "timestamp_updated": 1418456406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.727997", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13339265": {"recommendationid": "13339265", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995327888", "num_games_owned": 437, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420856633}, "language": "english", "review": "I tried exiting the game and it insulted me. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1418447696, "timestamp_updated": 1418447696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13338945": {"recommendationid": "13338945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043733007", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418788675}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good game.

Back in 1996, Rogue Entertainment made it's debut with the most ambitious use of the Doom engine yet. Strife hit the scene as the first true story-driven FPS/RPG hybrid. Using a hub system quite similar to Hexen, Strife also added in NPCs, voiced dialog, and actual conversation choices that affect the outcome of the game. Compared to the mindless run and gun action of previous Doom-based games, this was quite a refreshing change. And now 18 years later Night Dive Studios has taken this amazing classic, and given it the kind of re-release that quite frankly I wish could be done for every Doom-engine game!\n\nRight off the bat when you start up Strife: Veteran Edition you're greeted with a plethora of options, ranging from enhanced music to widescreen views, FOV, bloom, and all the other trimmings. You want delicious crunchy pixels? You got it! Smoothed filtering your kinda thing? It's there too! Night Dive Studios has replaced the \"vanilla\" doom engine with a massively reworked version of the hit source port Chocolate Doom. Despite the source code for Strife being lost to the ages, they have managed to completely reverse-engineer the game, and bring it perfectly into the modern age.\n\nEverything that made Strife what it is is completely intact here, and it all holds up very well considering the game's age. From the games stealth elements to its vicious deathmatch mode, this package is just dripping with juicy goodness. The original manual, town map, and field guide are all included as .pdf files, and the Roland SC-55 soundtrack is present as ogg files. Speaking of music, if you want to experience the oldschool synthesizer charms of retro Adlib sound, you can turn on OPL3 music in the sound settings.\n\nAs if all of the above wasn't good enough, Night Dive has also augmented Strife: Veteran Edition with a set of trading cards, badges and achievements. They are also planning further additions such as a \"capture the Chalice\" multiplayer mode, and better automapping. If only id Software would hire Night Dive to give Doom, Heretic and Hexen this kind of epic overhaul. Those games sorely need it as the janky Dosbox setup they have on Steam is just not pretty. Strife: Veteran edition is a shining example of what happens with a game company is passionate about both the game at hand, and giving their customers the best experience possible.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1418412022, "timestamp_updated": 1418412022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 191, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.862907", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39611561": {"recommendationid": "39611561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093363183", "num_games_owned": 459, "num_reviews": 195, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 59, "last_played": 1516903839}, "language": "english", "review": "I never played Strife back in the day so this is my first time.

Careful, you can set yourself ablaze! The story ain't gonna sell any novels any time soon but it steers the game well and all the important dialogue is voiced well.. The music can be quite atmospheric and occassionally catchy.

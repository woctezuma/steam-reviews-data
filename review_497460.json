Es ist wieder so ein Titel wo ich gerne ein \"vielleicht\" als Empfehlung aussprechen w\u00fcrde.\n\nMervils macht insgesamt eigentlich alles richtig. Es bietet eine ganz gute Grafik, viele liebevolle Details, gro\u00dfe Levels, so dass man 6 Stunden besch\u00e4ftigt ist, bis man das Spiel bis zum Ende gespielt hat. Es ist definitiv eines der hochwertigsten Indie Spiele auf dem Markt.\nWer Mario S\u00fcchtig ist und die 3D Versionen bspw. auf dem Game Qube entsprechend gerne gespielt hat, der sollte einen Blick auf Mervils werfen.\n\nF\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich ist das allerdings nichts. Ich brauche ehrlich gesagt keine echte 3D Erfahrung bei einem solchen Spiel, aber gut, dar\u00fcber lie\u00dfe sich sicherlich streiten, doch vor allem komme ich mit der Steuerung nicht so gut klar. Einerseits die Touch Controller, bei denen ich etwas Probleme habe, die Richtung wirklich pr\u00e4zise anzugeben, so dass ich immer wieder an Objekten vorbei springe. Vor allem aber auch die Kamera. Da man nicht festgeklebt hinter der Figur her l\u00e4uft (Motion Sickness ist da durchaus ein Faktor) springt man mit der Kamera per Teleport hinterher. Das ganze h\u00e4lt mich dann aber irgendwie auf. Ich ertappe mich dabei dass ich st\u00e4ndig denke, dass ich bereits viel weiter w\u00e4re, wenn ich nicht 3 mal an dem verdammten Goldst\u00fcck vorbei gesprungen w\u00e4re und mich nach dem Teleport schneller und besser orientieren k\u00f6nnte.\nIch gebe aber absolut zu, dass dies eine rein subjektive Erfahrung ist. Mit etwas \u00dcbung bekommt man diese Dinge sicherlich in den Griff und kann Mervils in VR \u00e4hnlich schnell und sicher spielen, wie ein \"normales\" Jump'n Run. Es ist aber f\u00fcr mich einfach kein Titel, bei dem ich pers\u00f6nlich einen Mehrwert in VR sehe und eine VR Erfahrung brauche. Ich habe nach kurzer Zeit bereits gedacht, ich w\u00fcrde es lieber vor einem Monitor mit Pad in der Hand spielen.\n\nEmpfehle ich dieses Spiel? Schwierige Entscheidung.

It fascinated me like no Vive game yet and I played a considerable amount of them. First of all the game's content adds up to roughly 7 hours of gameplay, which is, how you surely know, top notch in today's VR gaming. Given that you can spend a lot of cash on very short VR experiences, the 20 bucks for this one feel like a free giveaway. \n\nYou play the game in 3rd Person perspective, meaning you stand in the level, controlling and following around your character. Your character's movements result from your thumb sliding over the controllers round touch button, which feels very smooth and allows precise movements. So you are basically your character's coach behind his shoulder, observing from above, looking where to go next. \n\nThe game consists of 4 worlds, each has 3 levels and each has a boss fight. As I jump&ran and adventured my way through them, I couldn't help but get serious Zelda and Mario64 vibes. \nWhat was especially fascinating to me was how the developers brought variation to the game. Every single level tells another unique story. One time you have to help people gather equipment to fight a dragon, another time you are recruiting a pirate crew, then you go solve the puzzles of a mysterious temple or just have a jolly good time sliding down a rapid ice slide.\nThe fact that every level feels new and has fresh ideas prevents this game from ever getting repetitive and you will wish for more once you have it finished.\n\nAs I am a huge fan of boss fights, I was excited to play a VR game with bosses in it. If you like boss fights, you will find some delicacies in here. Keep an eye out for the boss of world 3, which was easily the most intense VR experience I had and, because of standing in the very atmospheric arena myself, one of the most outstanding boss fights I played.\n\nIf you enjoy adventures, do yourself a favor and get that game. It is a pioneer in VR adventures and I truly hope, that many future games will take inspiration from it.\n\nIf you want to check a few scenes of gameplay I leave you the link to my playthrough of the whole game, where you can check out every level.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYSo-GL7j5xrpgkToLJfEMe-lHkxWNGhG", "timestamp_created": 1482176648, "timestamp_updated": 1482176767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546525", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26512541": {"recommendationid": "26512541", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995730592", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479697905}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought for 20 bucks, expecting compatibility with the Rift as it claims - but whenever I launch the game it crashes immediately and freezes Steam.

It is a seated experience platforming game. You control a Mervil in third person (or first person if you can stomach it) and run around killing monsters and collecting pages and coins, and there are also some challenging puzzles. \n\nThere are different comfort modes: my favourite is where you have the camera stay in place and you press a button to teleport your camera to your mervil, or if you can stomach it you can have the camera always follow right behind your mervil.\n\nThis game doesn't use the motion controllers, so you will need a controller. I play it with the Steam Controller. Also, there are parts where you have to use your head, literally. For example: in one level there's a tightrope where leaning your head also leans your mervil.\n\nWhile I have more fun in room-scale games where I can use the motion controllers, I can only play those games for a few hours before my legs are too tired and I must sit down. And when I'm sitting down I'd much rather play a seated VR game than a 2D game.

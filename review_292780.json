Now, I personally think that Pajama Sam 2 isn't quite as good as the first and third games in the series, but that isn't saying much because this is an excellent adventure game. In this entry, Sam decides that he's had enough of a scary thunderstorm, and sets out to put a stop to Thunder and Lightning, who turn out to be sisters in charge of the world's weather. Finding a massive complex called World Wide Weather, he sneaks inside and has an accident that sends the weather operations into turmoil, and now he must find the four missing parts to bring the weather factories back on line, before Thunder and Lightning lose their jobs.\n\nOne point of criticism I have is that the big conundrum in the game  is all Sam's fault. That doesn't hurt my enjoyment of the game, but I don't like it when the main objective of game is undoing the protagonist's mistake. It would have been better if Sam had arrived just after things went awry, lending some mystery to what caused the problem; maybe Foster Boondoggle, who never appears in-person in the game, could secretly be the perpetrator who we confront at the end. \n\nOtherwise, the game is just what you'd expect from a Pajama Sam game: exploring a boy's wild imagination, populated by characters who are mostly living furniture and in a fun, nonsensical setting. The game world is a mix of industrial and corporate environments, contrasting with both PJ Sam 1 and 2. You'd think this would be boring, but the game is so imaginative that it's every bit as fun to explore as the other games. Something else that just occurred to me is the first three PJ Sam games each occur at different times of the day: PJ Sam 1 is at night, 2 is during the day, and 3 is during twilight. Having a fourth game kind of screws up that pattern, but oh well. \n\nAll in all, this is a great game for kids, and also for any fan of adventure games. In fact, I'd recommend any of the Pajama Sam or Spy Fox games for any adventure gamer, regardless of age.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1503914323, "timestamp_updated": 1503914323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33941294": {"recommendationid": "33941294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133096929", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498717721}, "language": "english", "review": "Purchased this game for nostalgia.

I wouldn't classify this as a edutainment-esque game to parents; its a point and click adventure game with a lot of quirky interations with the environment. Throughout many of their games Humungous Entertainment creates fun colorful environments that children will find entertaining. I played games by them when I was about 6-10, and that is the best captive audience for these games. Adults can find entertainment in this as well, but just keep in mind its a game made for children.\n\nSadly the game is a bit dated with the graphics and animations not holding up well to todays standards and the voice acting is sub-par; but its not like this was meant to be a triple A title. I did find some of the jazzy music to be pretty capturing though. \n\n\nId give it a 8/10, feel free to check out other Humungous Entertainment games like Freddy Fish or the other games in the Pajama Sam series.

Like 10/10's and what not. To be frank, I like these games as well. But are they absolute perfect? Hell, no. Not by my standards at least. The best Humongous game was probably Pajama Sam 1, and I'd probably give that a 7/10 or 8/10. But what about Pajama Sam 2? Ah yes, dear reader. What ABOUT Pajama Sam 2? \n\nThe game does have a lot of color and charm. It looks nice , and there are plenty of nice jokes only adults would get, as usual. However, the biggest dip in the game would be the story. In the original Pajama Sam, the story had just enough control in the player's hands to make the story build to an ultimate climax no matter how they got their objects. In Pajama Sam 2, the same thing is present, but out of nowhere, after you put in the third missing piece, a new story element pops out of nowhere in the appearance of a new character that is there purely for the reason of building tension. What was interesting about the tension in Pajama Sam 1, is it was shown through the visuals and the build-up both inside and outside of the story. Everything was connected, but detached enough for you to have your own adventure.\n\nAnd I think the biggest reason that the story just isn't that good is because of the set-up. Pajama Sam 1 had the point of the story be that you don't need to be afraid of the dark. Simple but still good. And the story built up to that overall point being the main message. In Pajama Sam 2, Sam instantly finds out, \"Hey! My fears are just controlled by a couple ladies in a sky-factory! There's nothing to be afraid of!\", leaving nothing to be learned but just having the player wait until the ending finally arrives.\n\nPajama Sam 2 is, by no means, a bad game. If you liked the charm of the last game, it's still here. At least that hasn't been killed off.... right Atari?  But Pajama Sam 1 was so good, and I think Humongous tried to bring back the magic by doing a lot of the same things from the first game all over again. Sam overcoming his fears, the room with four questions, the lost items scattered across the world. It's all the same. Hell, Pajama Sam 2 loves to reference the first game a lot as well. You run into the carrot, some of the portraits have characters from Pajama Sam 1 in them for no reason, and there are binoculars for you to go look at the Land of Darkness.

I don't mean that lightly. The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself exploring one room for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of not finding the solution is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the worlds are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a puzzle to earn a new area, and you would use that new area to earn more puzzles. In layman's terms, to earn more rooms, you had to perfect current puzzles. They ditched that and added the ability to google the solutions. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock the first room. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many rooms are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging rooms, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to play every variation.\n\nAnother thing I absolutely enjoy about Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightning Aren't So Frightening is its expasive community. There are lots of flash games for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.\n\nOverall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either.

Even today i still play it from time to time. This game is the best game for younger children I've ever seen\n\nIf your child has played beginning level software and is ready to move on to more advanced gameplay, Humongous Entertainment's Pajama Sam series (and Freddie Fish and Putt-Putt as well) are an excellent choice. These titles take the cognitive tasks up a notch as children must accumulate specific items, navigate a number of locations, and use their problem-solving skills to help new friends and achieve larger goals. Along the way, funny and lovable Pajama Sam will meet a number of nice characters, visit a variety of interesting locations and play mini-games as he completes the larger task of helping to fix the interesting and entertaining weather machine. Along the way he will solve a lot of smaller puzzles. Specifics change if you start a new game, and you will want to play with your child a few times before they'll be able to enjoy it on their own, so each game is good for hours of fun.\n\n(Above Review from Amazon.ca) \n\nI love PS and respect the seris, I originally didn\u2019t like this installment but now am open to it.", "timestamp_created": 1419990909, "timestamp_updated": 1486409085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460140", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13647845": {"recommendationid": "13647845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063042936", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1410983636}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing this game I am no longer scarred of anything.

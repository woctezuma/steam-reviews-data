It's a game that seems to mash together the core concepts of two classics, Galaga and Asteroids, while maintaining a completely unique and fresh take on old concepts.\n\nIt took me 4.2 hours to complete the game, which revolves around collecting coins that drop every once in a while from incoming asteroids and enemy ships. With these coins, the player purchases new ships from the start menu. Also, the player can collect powerups while playing, which introduce clever twists into the gameplay. It's a simple, yet surprisingly fun game. I had a lot of fun playing it on a long road trip I recently went on.\n\nI played this game on my laptop, which has a 4th-gen Intel Core i5 with integrated graphics. At 1080p, there were absolutely no frame drops or crashes -- the game was totally stable and reliable. The game also supports controllers, and my SteelSeries Stratus XL works perfectly with it (though I didn't end up using this feature much -- keyboards are far more accurate).\n\nNow, let's talk about the best part of this game: the value. I'm pretty sure I bought this for 99 cents, and what amazes me, as well as many other reviewers, is the amount of gameplay you get for that price. I got 4.2 hours of gameplay from this game, and I'm sure that I could get far more if I could find the \"clear data\" button. Or I could just try to beat my highscore again. Or I could try to master using some of my less preferred ships. See, there's just so much to do! And all for the price of something you'd get at a vending machine!\n\nIf I had to put anything against this game, it would have to be the overpoweredness of the enemy ships that appear. These ships shoot projectiles at time intervals, and the problem is that since you can't stop your ship, you will often go through multiple insane manuevers, dodging entire *waves* of bullets, and then die while flying towards a ship, getting in close (the ships are really, REALLY inaccurate) and then getting shot by the ship you were half a second from destroying. This is not helped by another flaw in the game mechanics -- accuracy. As I mentioned above, the inaccuracy of the ship's guns cause you to *have* to get in close, which makes it nearly impossible to avoid being shot. Yes, you \"get the hang of it,\" but even after 4.2 hours of doing the same thing over and over again, I'd say that I was still getting shot 20% of the time. \n\nI think the dev could kill two birds with one stone by fixing the latter of the above problems by introducing some form of aim assistance into the game. I would suggest that the dev make shots fired a certain amount of degrees off (5? 7? 10?) hit their target. It could vastly improve the gameplay experience, and make dying from close-range fire much less common. \n\nIn conclusion: I very much enjoy this game. It's a fresh take on old concepts, and is really a joy to play. I do think that this game has some issues, but I believe that these could be easily fixed by the developer. For the price of only 99 cents, this is a steal!", "timestamp_created": 1515555514, "timestamp_updated": 1515555514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39220332": {"recommendationid": "39220332", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986279791", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "last_played": 1515862335}, "language": "english", "review": "XBOX ONE S CONTROLLER NOT WORKING\nFOR ME IT IS STUCK LIKE THE LEFT ARROW IS ON ALL THE TIME, ONLY RESTARTING WITHOUT THE CONTROLLER ON SEEMS NORMAL HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO PLAY THROUGH MUCH TO TEST IF MORE IS NOT WORKING BUT....", "timestamp_created": 1515545075, "timestamp_updated": 1515545075, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39218561": {"recommendationid": "39218561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145650935", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1515248291}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been on the hunt for a retro/arcadish/8-Bit/classic game for quite some time.\nThis one certainly meets these requirements.

The basics are that you're in a ship shooting rocks which break into smaller rocks while alien ships try to destroy you.  \n\nBecause your weapon only has a limited amount of shots you're required to pick up ammo capsules to keep reloading your weapon.  The power ups that you can collect are balanced nicely in that the more powerful ones tend to go through your ammo quicker.  You're also given a limited amount of super bombs which destroy everything on the screen.\n\nThe enemies are also of a nice variety.  Some shoot at you, others are essentially time bombs that blow up after a certain period of time, others launch a large volley of shots, etc.  \n\nGold coins will also appear from destroyed enemies.  These gold coins can be used to unlock other ships which have different stats: more shields, more super bombs, etc.  \n\nThe soundtrack is also pleasant to listen to.\n\nTIP: If you want to make the game harder turn on auto-fire.

And yet the two games are so similar, with ship upgrades, a race for higher scores, rotating and thrusting for movement... Now here it is twenty years later, and what does Bit Blaster have that Maelstrom doesn't? Plus, Maelstrom was released as free software, so you can download it even before you finish reading this review.\n\nI am fairly certain that the majority of reviewers would be spitting mad if they had purchased the Bit Blaster game for the ten dollars that most light steam games have for a price. I do not think the overwhelming positive reviews are a good reflection of the quality of this game, except that people have very low expectations when they are getting what they see as a bargain. (And my sympathies in advance to the game author, who no doubt will read this and try to respond, as I have seen him do to other negative reviews. I do understand you put a good faith effort into creating, pricing, and supporting this game.) In hopes of being balanced here, I want to point out that there is a nine MP3 track DLC that unlocks at no cost. It is chiptune music. I initially did not notice it, and it may be interesting for people still considering a purchase.", "timestamp_created": 1514043920, "timestamp_updated": 1514060101, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501350", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38580789": {"recommendationid": "38580789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168721583", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514040172}, "language": "english", "review": "best game ever", "timestamp_created": 1514039862, "timestamp_updated": 1514039862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38578391": {"recommendationid": "38578391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195917149", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514734450}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1514036302, "timestamp_updated": 1514036302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38576037": {"recommendationid": "38576037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198396100753", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 60, "last_played": 1516041364}, "language": "german", "review": "Super Gelegenheitsspiel !!

enough coins to buy the next ship up, you can't skip from ship 2 to 6 for example, no, you have to buy them in order, I like this, it forces the user to try different play styles and adds more hours of playablity to the overall game.\n\nthe weapon powerups are fantastic, with a good selection of bullet types.\n\nEach ship has a highscore, I use this to guage which ship I'm best at, the higher the score the better I am at that ship. \n\nI would recommend this arcade shootem up to pretty much anybody, it's a simple 2d game that should run on any system that runs steam, it's crazy cheap and has a

What this game is an old school game. It's all about a spaceship shooting other obstacles, getting various bonuses and weapons. Your aim here is to get the highest score possible. Sometimes I need something easy to spend my time on. \nIt's quick, doesn't require you to involve too much and in some magical way keeps occupied. \nOverall, I think it's affordable and worth getting if you miss old school games. You can definitely give it a try.", "timestamp_created": 1511708659, "timestamp_updated": 1511708659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37638899": {"recommendationid": "37638899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198425422988", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514010629}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u64cd\u63a7\u6027\u5f88\u5f3a", "timestamp_created": 1511686805, "timestamp_updated": 1511686805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37631317": {"recommendationid": "37631317", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301965117", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511682234}, "language": "russian", "review": "it is really good play", "timestamp_created": 1511681598, "timestamp_updated": 1511682374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37611614": {"recommendationid": "37611614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139417754", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512972054}, "language": "english", "review": "i like this game, its basic but a lot of fun at a good price.

"Love the retro 80s feel, this game is like a mixed version of a lot of really popular games from the time, like Galaga, 1942, Defender etc. I really like how these games have been put together and improved as well as adding another dimension to the game which is unlocking new ships, the best part about unlocking these new ships is they aren't just about different looks, they all have completely different stats, such as movement speed, lives, firing rate, and others. Another amazing feature is the music, with heaps of different soundtracks, you really can't get bored playing, in fact this game is probably the most addicting game I own! I really recommend this game for anything from a simple skill-based game to improve your high score, to something to play while you wait on friends.

It's actually quite enjoyable for me and allows me to reminisce in the times that everyone would hang out at Nickel City or the arcade and play games on the big machines together.\n\nEssentially, what you want to do is start it up, and change whether you prefer auto fire or not. This 100% depends on your play preference as the auto fire will help you get started but to really grasp the higher levels and be able to take on various power boosts (one specific one I can think of that uses a lot of ammo is the laser, which is extremely helpful especially over 30,000 score.) There are minimal settings, which allow for very smooth and fun at the same time gameplay for everyone of all ages.\n\nThere are achievement, and trading cards. The achievements are hard enough to get that you will have to genuinely work for them over just being given them for logging in. Many people will get discouraged by the large amount of score you need but please don't! It's not as hard as it seems and after a few hours of working on your skills I guarentee that you will be able to start getting some of the higher level rockets and achievements.\n\nIt's very cheap, for a modern day game. It provides tons of fun, especially offline. And with no in app purchases, pay to win features, and no multiplayer even, you can just wind down or relax after a long day and play some Bit Blaster XL.

La jugabilidad es excelente, las diferentes naves y power ups enriquecen las partidas y son muy variados, la m\u00fasica es buen\u00edsima y alcanzar altas puntuaciones es un aut\u00e9ntico reto. Extraordinaria calidad que sorprende en un t\u00edtulo que aparenta sencillez, si te gustan los arcades y/o los dise\u00f1os 8 bit pru\u00e9balo.\n\nGr\u00e1ficos y Tecnolog\u00eda >>> BIEN ! + 1,5 puntos\n\nPlanos 3G en 8 bit, el universo pixelado de Bit Blaster contrasta entre power ups y asteroides de dise\u00f1o muy simplista con naves y enemigos muy variados y bonitos a pesar de usar solo pocos cuadros de color. El dise\u00f1o de las ocho naves jugables es muy bueno, as\u00ed como la fluidez gr\u00e1fica de fondos, disparos, explosiones y haces de luz (que tambi\u00e9n son peque\u00f1os p\u00edxeles perdi\u00e9ndose en el espacio). Sin embargo es todo puro p\u00edxel, TIENE que gustarte ese tipo de entornos y para mi gusto abusa un poco del color blanco, sin llegar por eso a ser molesto. El juego pesa solamente 105 mb y podr\u00e1s jugarlo en cualquier PC medio.\n\nHistoria y Niveles >>> POBRE + 0,5 puntos\n\nNo hay historia, el objetivo es eliminar todos los astros y enemigos que cruzan la pantalla sin explotar y sin tocar los bordes de \u00e9sta.  Aunque hay dos modos de juego, la verdadera diversi\u00f3n es al utilizar las distintas naves con caracter\u00edsticas \u00fanicas y tratar de acumular el mayor n\u00famero de puntos con todas ellas. Las partidas se hacen progresivas y muy emocionantes ofreciendo verdaderos momentos bullet hell, con un nivel de dificultad creciente que poco a poco va oprimiendo hasta no poder evitar morir. El correcto uso de los power ups se hace imprescindible y obtener alto puntaje es complicado, sobretodo pasados los 50k o 60k.\n\nM\u00fasica y Sonidos >>> BIEN ! + 1,5 puntos\n\nExcelente composici\u00f3n musical de temas 8 bit que tienen mucha profundidad y personalizan cada una de las naves. La banda sonora no solamente transmite emoci\u00f3n por la partida, si no que se hace totalmente disfrutable por s\u00ed misma (deber\u00eda haber un DLC en MP3) y tiene detalles geniales como reducir su tempo y tono cuando el juego est\u00e1 en pausa. Tambi\u00e9n destaco que se reinicia con fluidez cuando una canci\u00f3n termina y sobreviviste lo suficiente. Adem\u00e1s, el juego tiene buenos efectos de sonido que  cumplen con nota tanto en explosiones como en las armas y sonidos del espacio, sin por ello molestar o opacar la m\u00fasica.\n\nControl y Jugabilidad >>> PERFECTO !! + 2 puntos\n\nFunciona bien en TODOS mis mandos de PC !! Tambi\u00e9n permite personalizar al gusto controles, teclas y rat\u00f3n. La c\u00e1mara es fija y el control de giro relativo, eso puede confundir al principio pero con el tiempo se prueba como muy fluido y permite hacer verdaderas virguer\u00edas esquivando disparos. Me encanta que no haya ayuda al disparo ni se use el rat\u00f3n para apuntar. Por otro lado, las diferentes naves, armas y power ups est\u00e1n MUY bien pensados y te hace descubrir pros y contras para cada uno de ellos, aumentando la calidad del juego enormemente. Y como guinda no he encontrado ni un s\u00f3lo bug, es un juegazo muy s\u00f3lido.\n\nIntegraci\u00f3n en Steam >>>  BIEN ! + 1,5 puntos\n\nEl juego tiene tres tipos de logros: Por desbloquear las ocho naves (f\u00e1cil), por acumulaci\u00f3n de puntos (f\u00e1cil) y por m\u00e1ximo de puntos en una misma partida (solo el de 75.000 es complicado). Para conseguirlo deber\u00e1s ganar mucha soltura con las diferentes naves y armas hasta encontrar una estrategia que te funcione para tu habilidad de juego. El juego tiene cromos Steam pero se extra\u00f1an marcadores o ranking, ser\u00edan muy interesantes. En cuanto a precio, es juego de un euro que tiene posibilidad de comprarse en un pack con otros juegos del desarrollador, por lo que es compra perfecta en cuanto a calidad/precio.\n\nCONCLUSI\u00d3N FINAL >>>  7,0 un juego Notable, MUY Recomendado\n\nBit Blaster XL funciona muy bien tanto como juego de arcade espacial como juego retro estilo 8 bit. A pesar de haberlo superado hace tiempo sigo jugando a \u00e9l, de verdad se extra\u00f1a mucho un r\u00e1nking o marcador Steam que permita compararse con jugadores de todo el mundo.

There is enough variety in the ships you unlock to make playing with each a slightly different experience. Game keeps challenging your mind and focus, as you have to watch out for collisions and be careful not to run out of ammo while aiming and controlling the speed.

But if you're looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place. [/h1]\n\nIngredients\n- To Make the Dough\n375 grams (3 cups) plain flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 eggs\n1/4 cup (50 ml / 3\u00bd tablespoons) olive oil\n1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water\nExtra flour for dusting \n\n\n- To Make Cheese Filling\n15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese\n5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) \"3 Cheese Italian Blend\" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)\nNote: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.\n1/2 cup cheddar cheese\n2 eggs, lightly beaten\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n\n\n- Extras\nYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)\nParmesan cheese\nBasil\nFried vegetables\nShrimp\nFish slices\nChicken pieces \nMake the Ravioli filling.\n\n- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.\n- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.\n- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.\n- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. \n\nMake the Ravioli dough.\n\n- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.\n- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.\n- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.\n- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.\n- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.\n- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).\n- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn\u2019t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. \n\nFill the Ravioli shells.\n\n- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.\n- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.\n- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a \u201chomemade\u201d touch as well.\n- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.\n- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. \n\nForm the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.\n\n- Roll the dough into two sheets\n- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.\n- Fill with the ravioli mixture.\n- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.\n- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.\n\nCook the Ravioli.\n\n- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.\n- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.\n- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest \n- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates\n\nServe it up.\nTop with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1501452328, "timestamp_updated": 1501452328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495825", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33909253": {"recommendationid": "33909253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210253252", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501434056}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10.\nGreat time-killer!

I looked at it again, was again not really interested and then saw that the programmer is doing this for fun and that he took the pains of also releasing a linux build... oh well, I thought - this has to be rewarded, even if I'm not going to play the game, so I bought it and installed it to see if it would run out of the box on my system (which I do routinely even if I don't play the game)... so I figured, it's a quick game, let's try one time... a few seconds later I was killed... ah well, another one... boom... and on... and on... It is a simple game, and the mechanics are well known, but it brings a lot of variety to the table like many different weapons, the limited ammo, different unlockable ships, various different enemies and a nice soundtrack that doesn't get on your nerves.\n\nFor the money it costs, it is a steal and it entertains you for a few minutes or a few hours - whatever you want.

I have used it as a reward for studying: 25 minutes of studying, then 5 minutes of playing this game. Made studying easier.\n\nReasons for recommending this game:\n- Nice retro graphics and music (best soundtrack since Battlefield 1942 and Fifa 98)\n- You can immediately start playing, so it's also fun for just a few minutes\n- Fun to play 'hot seat', for the same reason\n- Fun to unlock new spaceships\n\nReasons for not recommending this game (although I do recommend it):\n- It's quite brief... it's the first PC game I finished in over a decade, simply because it only took me 4h. Of course, I can continue to try and get higher scores, but it's less appealing, as no further unlocks are available.\n- The online ranking button doesn't work (on my game at least).\n\nMy improvement suggestions would be:\n- Don't increase the price for new unlocks, since it would feel like 'overpricing' the new ships. The current prices are fine. However, extra unlocks would be nice, such as the following.\n- Option to increase the ammo cap to 200, price for instance 150 golden-coinlike-things\n- Option to get 1 extra ammo per green-ammo-thing, price for instance 100 golden coinlike things. This item should be available for infinite times, but every time for a higher price (e.g. 100-200-300-400-500-600-...)\n- Option to increase the time a weapon works (I mean the round items with a letter in it, such as the green L, which gives a laser), price for instance 250 for doubling the time, 500 for doubling it again, 1000 for doubling it again, etc.\n- Option to start with a certain weapon (prices dependent on how good the weapon is)\n- Option to be able to go through the borders (re-appearing on the opposite site)\n\nThis could turn the game into something that would be fun for 10 times as much time, although it will probably cost 10% extra programming time (or less). Nonetheless, I would understand if the developer wouldn't want to introduce such extra's, since it's more like a hobby project of his, to make some small games.", "timestamp_created": 1500019729, "timestamp_updated": 1500019729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496829", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33505234": {"recommendationid": "33505234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357108870", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502731988}, "language": "english", "review": "gud game", "timestamp_created": 1499958573, "timestamp_updated": 1499958573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456279", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33495002": {"recommendationid": "33495002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304336013", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499918357}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u771f\u7684\u8003\u9a8c\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b", "timestamp_created": 1499919059, "timestamp_updated": 1499919059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33489972": {"recommendationid": "33489972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143746424", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512441889}, "language": "english", "review": "I checked out the reviews before buying this and I noticed that a few users described the game as \"addictive\".

to grasp mechanics (gameplay is simple but has enough depth to reward practice and strategy)\n-simple but appealing visual style (bullets and explosions are satisfying, but not disruptive enough to hinder vision)\n-great music (each ship has its own unique retro themed track)\n\nCons:\n-in keeping with the retro theme, aiming from a distance is very tricky, so less skilled players may have trouble getting the game rolling (made even more difficult by different ships having different turn rates)\n-on the flip side, getting through the early rounds can feel like a chore once you have a good grasp of the mechanics\n-powerups have strengths and weaknesses, but balance could use a little tuning (just my opinion)\n\nSummary:\nBit Blaster is an incredibly addicting arcade style shooter.

Rather than being comparable to arcade classics like Asteroid and Space Invaders, it's a pretty average free-to-play mobile game, like an uninspired Tilt To Live clone, up on Steam for some reason.\n\nThe good:  Responsive, not buggy, there's a game here with an element of skill.  Graphics and sfx are simple, but appealing.  Seems well-programmed and highly compatible.  Occupies your attention if you need to kill time.\n\nThe bad:  Unoriginal.  Slow, dull start.  Awkward control scheme, without enjoyable movement physics (space-themed graphics, but drives like a car).  Success seems more based on randomness than skill, due to random power ups and enemies.  No real depth.  Skinner-box unlockables.  Music is an earworm that gets old fast.\n\nBottom line: It's not like it's crushingly terrible, and it's certainly not expensive, but why spend time playing this with so many other options?", "timestamp_created": 1499129710, "timestamp_updated": 1499129710, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519481", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33208343": {"recommendationid": "33208343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092163077", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493243122}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game during one of the steam sales, and boy is it ever an addictive arcade game.

Don't let the cheap price convince you that this is shovelware. Bit Blaster XL is a great deal of fun.\n\nImagine Asteroids, except that you control a more maneuverable ship that constantly moves forward, and you face a wider variety of hostile ships that shoot at you.\n\nYou can unlock additional ships with slightly different stats (shield count, bomb count, movement speed, hitbox size). Although the ships are all the same basic white palette, and all look kind of similar, they handle differently enough that each one feels like it requires a distinct play style. The game stores separate high scores for each ship, too. The one drawback is that ships must be unlocked in order, meaning you'll have to play for quite some time before you uncover the V8.\n\nUnlockables are purchased using coins that downed enemies and asteroids drop at random during play. This can be a pain, as there are times when you can play for a while without making any progress toward a new ship. On the plus side, finding these collectibles can make even a poor scoring run feel worthwhile, since they bring you that much closer to your next unlockable.\n\nSessions can last anywhere from a minute to an hour, depending on how well you play. I find that it lines up with my attention span pretty well. Generally, this game is good for a quick round or two while you're procrastinating.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're a fan of space shooters, or are looking for a cheap, fast game to pad your collections of achievements and trading cards.", "timestamp_created": 1498621347, "timestamp_updated": 1499640977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32906275": {"recommendationid": "32906275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286321910", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499644759}, "language": "english", "review": "Reminds me of Asteroids with alot of flash.

Enemies drop ammo and sometimes coins. Coins are used to unlock more ships (8 total), later ships have more initial shields, bombs, manueverability, and rate of fire. There are separate high scores for each ship.\n\nThe power-up system is very minimal. Powerups are randomly generated (14 total types), don't stack and collecting one replaces the previous one. This means that you want to be lucky with which ones are generated and once you get a good one, avoid the rest. I would have preferred a system where power-ups were additive (instead of replacing the prior one) or at least if you picked up multiple of the same ones the effect would be increased.\n\nThe game has auto-fire on by default, but manual shooting is recommended to conserve ammo. Power-ups last as long as you don't run out of ammo. If you aren't wasting ammo with auto-fire and don't accidentally collect too much, you should have a hoard of ammo floating around to easily replenish your power-up.\n\nWorth a look if you like very simple top-down shooters and like grinding for high scores.\n\nOther thoughts:\n[list]\n[*] Bombs don't cover the whole screen unless you're in the center. They also destroy power-ups (but not ammo).\n[*] My favorite power-ups are Flame, Blast, and Laser. Homing is nice early, it takes care of enemies automatically but you get overwhelmed later on.\n[*] Magnet is pretty useless and just eats up the ammo you usually save for later. Explode feels pretty bad (because of the slow shooting speed) until you unlock ships with better rates of fire.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1498260860, "timestamp_updated": 1498261091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32701293": {"recommendationid": "32701293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077958046", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498257948}, "language": "english", "review": "best dollar I've spent this year", "timestamp_created": 1498257978, "timestamp_updated": 1498257978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32699529": {"recommendationid": "32699529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107418036", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513347655}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego es la prueba de que no hace falta historia ni graficos para aporrear el teclado, sudar de la tensi\u00f3n y cagarte en todo lo cagable cuando revientan tu nave. \nPor lo simple que es engancha cosa mala y a un precio de lujo.\nAdem\u00e1s hace rememorar esos queridos a\u00f1os.\nRecomendado jugar con los amigos aunque sea de un solo jugador.", "timestamp_created": 1498254478, "timestamp_updated": 1511555389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32693115": {"recommendationid": "32693115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050522641", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483871599}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c.", "timestamp_created": 1498243245, "timestamp_updated": 1498243245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32685168": {"recommendationid": "32685168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164926404", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511411825}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30b5\u30de\u30fc\u30bb\u30fc\u30eb\u3067WM\u8cb7\u3046\u3058\u3083\u3093\uff1f\u30a6\u30a3\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u8cb7\u3044\u3042\u3055\u308b\u3058\u3083\u3093\uff1f\u3002\u6570\u767e\u5186\u5206\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u306e\u6b8b\u9ad8\u4f59\u3063\u3061\u3083\u3046\u3088\u306d\u3002\n\u305f\u3060\u4f55\u8cb7\u304a\u3046\u304b...\u3002\u3053\u308c\u3002\u5272\u5f15\u306749\u5186\u3068\u30ef\u30f3\u30b3\u30a4\u30f3\u3067\u3059\u3089\u306a\u3044\u304a\u624b\u9803\u4fa1\u683c\u3002\u30d4\u30b6\u3092\u6211\u6162\u3059\u308b\u5fc5\u8981\u3082\u306a\u3044\u3002\u305b\u3081\u3066\u99c4\u83d3\u5b50\u3060\u308d\u3046\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1498230924, "timestamp_updated": 1498230924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.425163", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32674417": {"recommendationid": "32674417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393272448", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 60, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502150256}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]\"Bit Blaster XL\"[/h1] This is a Very Simple Game, yet i find Myself Playing it all the Time.

However, I bought this game because it was under a dollar (in terms of USD), and I haven't played arcade shooters in more than a decade. So it was more of a novelty.\n\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\nBit Blaster XL itself is not very innovative. It's a pretty straightforward arcade shooter, with a grindy unlock system for more powerful spaceships. Ironically I preferred the slower, lower-tier spaceship for its easier control haha.\n\nI find the difficulty ramp-up a little unsatisfying. Some spaceships are mere annoyances, while there's 2 particular spaceships that are a must-kill or the map becomes a dodge-em after than a shoot-em-up.\n\nAmmo and Boost/Brake is a limited resource, though the latter is time-rechargeable. The limited ammo is pretty interesting, though I find it a little on the tough side to conserve ammo given that all the Ammo powerups eat through ammo so quickly.\n\nFor its price, Bit Blaster XL is pretty alright for a quick, casual play. There's enough gameplay mechanics and polish inside to give you a few good hours spread over a couple of days.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nEach ship has its own music. I think my spaceship choice is somewhat related to my preferred choice of tunes. It's a little refreshing when you switch to a new ship after a couple of rounds/days and you hear a new tune.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nI highly recommend using a controller for this game. If you're using controller, you should probably remap the buttons so that you can Fire, Boost/Brake at the same time.\n\n[h1]Performance[/h1]\nThis game has mild performance issues. Keep VSync on. Although VSync off makes the controls more responsive, but it causes random screen stutters. I'm using i7-7700HQ so it's not a spec issue.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\n* Polish: 5/5\n* Novelty: 2/5\n* Music: 4/5\n* Fun: 4/5\n* Replayability: 5/5\n* Playtime: 0.2 - 0.5 hour each\n\n[h1]See Also: Orbt XL[/h1]\nGo get the developer's other game as a Bundle: Orbt XL. It's more addictive and fun.", "timestamp_created": 1497792865, "timestamp_updated": 1498647233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32536642": {"recommendationid": "32536642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313011891", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497416709}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u601d\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5f88\u9002\u5408\u6d88\u78e8\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5404\u79cd\u6b66\u5668\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5f88\u6709\u8da3", "timestamp_created": 1497790760, "timestamp_updated": 1497790760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32525768": {"recommendationid": "32525768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198397714327", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498492886}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing!", "timestamp_created": 1497757907, "timestamp_updated": 1497757908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32523965": {"recommendationid": "32523965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198330080728", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "last_played": 1516217595}, "language": "english", "review": "A real timekiller", "timestamp_created": 1497751567, "timestamp_updated": 1497751567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32499716": {"recommendationid": "32499716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198391701064", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503649158}, "language": "turkish", "review": "kart y\u00f6n\u00fcnden g\u00fczel", "timestamp_created": 1497694035, "timestamp_updated": 1497694035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32489702": {"recommendationid": "32489702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271975419", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514606734}, "language": "english", "review": "this is an awsome game i understand that some will get bord quickly but for me i have 4 hours in it and am still having fun.(but it is a hard game) it is also worth pointing out that there is no \"end game\" it just gose on forever. i wish there was a story mode and then a survivle mode. overall i loved it.", "timestamp_created": 1497659284, "timestamp_updated": 1497659284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32460023": {"recommendationid": "32460023", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009020579", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492698382}, "language": "english", "review": "A goofy but fun time waster.

Bit Blaster XL is a retro styled, addictive, and fast paced arcade shoot 'em up!\"\n\nThis line from the description tells it all. A truly awesome game!\n\nIt feels like the love child of the classic Asteriods and Geometry Wars with a bit more influence from the former. If you like this genre you'll find a true gem playing this.\nThe game plays smoothly, I haven't tried the controller as I prefer the keyboard for these kind of games. The 8bit style chiptunes are nice. All the different enemies have a distinct behaviour and attack method, there are a wide range of powerups: you'll like some of them and try avoid the others depending on your play style. \n\nThe author has put a lot of work and love into this piece, and it shows. There are small but important details like the warning stipes at the edge of the screen before an enemy appears, and the fact that you can retry after dying with a single click; exactly how a game like this should be done!\nAs others said, the game is simple but hard to master, and strangely addictive.\n\nI costs around 1 USD and it's worth every penny.

For the price of what you'd pay these days for 30ish seconds in an arcade, you can buy this endlessly enjoyable arcade-inspired classic.  On the surface it look like it might be a twin-stick shooter, but you actually use a single analog of a gamepad and have to contend with the fact that you are always moving forward.  An interesting challenge for those used to games like Geometry Wars where control is very precise.  It also defaults to an \u201cauto fire\u201d mode which I quickly turned off since there is an ammo element to the game, but I think it does make the game slightly more accessible, which is always a good thing.\n\nWhat really sets Bit Blaster XL apart from its contemporaries is that it also implements some roguelite mechanics in that, throughout your play session, you're collecting coins to unlock more ships with different characteristics.  They vary in size, speed, firingpower, starting shields (health) and starting bombs.  At first they seem to be more like 'sidegrades' than upgrades, but as you unlock more they clearly become much more capable and allow you to get further \u2013 that is, if you're able to control their faster speed.  The best part of this is that each ship has its own musical theme when you use it and they're all pretty solid chiptune tracks.  All of this adds up to a great incentive to play more of what would normally just be a game that centered around chasing high scores.\n\nFor the base price of 99 cents, I don't know that this can really be beat as far as the sheer value and how much fun it is.  It's definitely a game I can see myself dipping in to whenever I have a spare 10 or 15 minutes and just want to see if I can knock out my high score.  I fully recommend picking it up even at full price (because who can't spare a dollar) not only because it's a good time, but because a developer like this needs to be encouraged to continue their efforts and dive in to development of even more robust games of this quality.\n\nIf you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EndyoGaming#curation", "timestamp_created": 1497072570, "timestamp_updated": 1499837089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.703637", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32306925": {"recommendationid": "32306925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355271541", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513140518}, "language": "english", "review": "this game only costs a 1$ and i love the feeling of an upgraded asteroids game", "timestamp_created": 1497061991, "timestamp_updated": 1497061991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32304169": {"recommendationid": "32304169", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001865483", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483373046}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an addictive game for sure, and one that is great for short bursts of play.

Bit Blaster XL es eso, un juego nuevo que revive lo retro; donde tu meta es  destruir a todo enemigo que se te ponga en el camino o ser destruido por ellos.\n\nEso s\u00ed, con las \u00fanicas reglas de hacerlo con estilo, conseguir monedas para obtener la nave que mejor se te adapte e ir batiendo tu record una y otra vez hasta lograr 75,000 puntos en una sola partida. Es tan fren\u00e9tico que se vuelve adictivo. Solo deber\u00e1s aplicar tus habilidades para esquivar disparos y pasar entre una explosi\u00f3n de ellos mientras te cargas a una bomba que va a soltar m\u00e1s. \nDe la banda sonora ni hablamos; esos sonidos de 8bits que amas desde que empiezan a sonar. \nModos de juego: B\u00e1sicamente juegas en el mismo punto, lo que quieres hacer es superar tus puntajes pero el juego te da opciones o dos formas de hacerlo, puedes hacerlo con Disparo Autom\u00e1tico activado (que se apega todav\u00eda m\u00e1s a esos jueguitos de la \u00e9poca de NES y el Nokia 3210, de este \u00faltimo, mi pap\u00e1 ten\u00eda uno, recuerdo que adem\u00e1s de la serpiente ten\u00eda un juego muy al estilo de este) y tambi\u00e9n puedes desactivarlo (con el que podr\u00e1s ahorrar munici\u00f3n de tu arma favorita y usarla solo cuando haga falta). Tiene unos gr\u00e1ficos simples y bonitos (nada que te haga llorar los ojos por ver demasiados fotogramas a la vez).\n\n\n[b] Resumen: [/b]\n\n[list]\n[*]Jugabilidad: 10/10, te encantara morir y vengarte (ahora que tienes bombas a tu disposici\u00f3n ser\u00e1 m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil salir de un apuro) Solo depender\u00e1 de la habilidad y la practica con la que dispongas; no porque te maten cada 10 segundos debes pensar que el juego es malo y debes darle una nota negativa.\n[*]Sonido: 10/10. Es f\u00e1cil acostumbrarte a los soniditos de tu nave, los disparos enemigos y la m\u00fasica de fondo\n[*]DLC: 100/10. \u00bfC\u00f3mo lo explico?\u2026 \u00a1Esa m\u00fasica tan buena que tiene el juego puedes descargarla a tu pc y escucharla mientras haces otra cosa, y es gratis! \u00bfQu\u00e9 m\u00e1s puedes pedir?\n[*]Modos de juego: 10/10. T\u00fa decides; juegas como hace a\u00f1os en otros juegos o controlas las r\u00e1fagas del arma.\n[*]Rejugablilidad: 10/10. M\u00e1s de lo mismo, como ya dije. Es adictivo, va a querer jugarlo una y otra vez para superar tus puntajes, adem\u00e1s al conseguir monedas podr\u00e1s comprar m\u00e1s naves que son ocho en total.\n[*]Controles: 10/10.

The music is really enjoyable, and each ship has a diffferent song that plays with it, which is just the greatest touch ever. I really wish the soundtrack was avaliable for download. There are a few different ships, and while each one has to be bought with coins you randomly get for enemies, it's balanced so it feels less like grinding to get the next ship as it is a suble tutorial to ristrict you to easier ships before giving you accsess to ships that are better, harder to use, or (most often) both.\n\n Let me jsut tell you: My biggest complain about this game is the shooting soundaffect is a bit out of place. The fact that I have to nit-pick this much for a flaw says a LOT about this game.\n\n This game may lack in having tons of content, it makes up for in having very hight quaility content, to the point where it's almost perfect.

Costing a buck at full price doesn't really matter to me since price point doesn't impact my enjoyment of games.", "timestamp_created": 1494291552, "timestamp_updated": 1494303662, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.393381", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31633866": {"recommendationid": "31633866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028879098", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494338386}, "language": "english", "review": "I like finding cheap games that are this much fun.

My overall dislike of your game, explained below, is no summary of your character, nor of your potential at making great games in the future. Now, let us begin. \n\nBit Blaster XL is one of the worst things that ever happened!\n\nIn this sadness simulator, Bit Blaster XL, players learn nothing about themselves, nor of the state of mankind, nor of the meaning behind their mortality. This \u201cgame,\u201d which makes 9/11 look good in comparison, gives no commentary, holds up no mirror to the soul, and is no better than terrorism.\n\nAt best, Bit Blaster XL is like innocent babies getting eaten alive.\n\nIt is a Zika-carrying mosquito, compared to True Works of Art\u2014like Big Mutha Truckers 2: Truck Me Harder. \n\nIn the THQ-published classic Big Mutha Truckers 2: Truck Me Harder, players see depictions of life in the United States, specifically in The South. It is a great work of video game realism.\n\nMeanwhile, Bit Blaster XL depicts nothing real nor fantastic, and offers no cultural transmission superior to feces spewing forth from a wrestler\u2019s anus. It normalizes racism, and it is worse than Slavery. In fact, Bit Blaster XL manages to be vomit mixed with semen. Even when compared to famously-Worst Games, like E.T. the Extraterrestrial. \n\nE.T. the Extraterrestrial, famous for its frustrating \u201cgameplay,\u201d at least provides players a touching message about the lives of Illegal Immigrants. While Bit Blaster XL depicts No Life\u2014just soulless, joyless spaceships, amid Space Trash.\n\nOne of my friends asked me, as I was discussing this vile garbage with him, \u201cAnd what is bit blaster in comparison to older arts, like literature?\u201d\n\nWell, in Tolstoy\u2019s Anna Karenina, for example, [spoiler] we see a hot aristocratic mom, Anna, become bored with her suffocating marriage to Karenin. We see her cheat on her husband with the handsome, virile Vronsky, and thus, her family gets destroyed (via her quest for a non-boring life). And by the end of the near-800-page, exquisitely-written novel, we see Anna fall deep into depression with Vronsky, with whom she has moved in. We see her spiral into an existential quagmire, one from which she cannot escape. Except by one method. [/spoiler]\n\nAnd what does Bit Blaster XL allow us to see? \n\nNothing! \n\nCompared to Tolstoy\u2019s classic, Bit Blaster XL is a Mass Grave\u2014mere seizure-inducing lights appearing on a screen, set to the tune of blindfolded men screaming.\n\nBit Blaster XL is a digital form of ISIS.\n\nAnd so, I recommend you save your dollar, and your time. Life is short, and you need not spend any of it on this child porn which masquerades as \u201cArt.\u201d \n\nOh, and DON\u2019T GIVE IN to the fact that the developer continues to update his game more than a year post-release, and even answers questions when players email him. Such behavior merely shows his inability to countenance the horror of this plague he\u2019s unleashed on the world.\n\nSo overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s okay.\n\n5/10", "timestamp_created": 1492835546, "timestamp_updated": 1492835546, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.282455", "comment_count": "11", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31287589": {"recommendationid": "31287589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247717476", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502836718}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.\nAddictive, and hard.\n8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1492829271, "timestamp_updated": 1492829271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31278981": {"recommendationid": "31278981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119610002", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497821071}, "language": "german", "review": "Gut", "timestamp_created": 1492793708, "timestamp_updated": 1492793708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31277165": {"recommendationid": "31277165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044989923", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492787979}, "language": "english", "review": "If you ever like asteroids or bullet hell even a little bit, you absolutely should play this!

I just wanted to let you know that today I have released a new game on Steam called [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/615610] [b]\u2019orbt xl\u2019[/b] [/url].\n\nIt\u2019s a small game like Bit Blaster XL and is a simple one button arcade game where the goal is to stay in orbit while avoiding obstacles. It\u2019s perfect to play when you just have a couple minutes for a few rounds. Due to its similarities to BBXL, I think you might enjoy it as well. It\u2019s available for 15% off for the first week and is very affordable like BBXL. If you do play [b]orbt xl[/b] and have some fun with it, please make sure to leave a brief Steam review. Your support helps me continue to learn game development and create more games for everyone to enjoy \ud83d\ude0a.\n\nThank you again for the support, I hope you enjoy [b]orbt xl[/b]!\n[i]Adam

Its that game you start to play and then get a highscore, and feel an addiction to beat it and get a better high score. That cycle goes on, and on, and on. This game seemed boring as hell when i saw it on sale at its 69 cent price point, but it was for some reason the highest rated game in its pricing range. I gave it a shot, since i had a dollar left i thought it wouldnt be too much of a loss if it turned out to be a boring game. I was wrong. Games this cheap generally are outright boring, but this game is the opposite. The graphics and just general UI are very well done in the 8 bit theme, and the music fits the game and the theme very well.

I want to like it so badly, but there are a few things that hold it back, at least for me.\nChief among them is the controls. I like my ships to go where I point, not rotate how I tell them. I'm comparing this game to Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved, and if the movement of the ship was handled like it was in that game I'd enjoy it a lot more -- especially since it would make aiming much easier. I guess it comes down to the disign choice where your ship can't stop moving -- I see the complexity it adds, but even if there was a way to make a control stick correspond to which direction the ship was facing it would be mch appreciated. The other things I dislike -- like a lack of wraparound -- are largely a matter of taste and don't affect my experience that badly, but the controls really hold this game back.\n\nAs far as the positives go, the other reviews are largely correct when they sing this game's praises. For the ridiculously low price point, having that many different ships and weapons is downright insane. There's a lot here, and I really want to dig into it further, but without any way to change the controls it may be stuck on the shelf for quite some time.\n\nThat said, if this game is on sale it becomes stupid cheap, and it's still inexpensive on its own, so if you want to spend a buck on steam, there are worse ways.\n\nAll in all, promising game with huge potential undone by controls that, while they do what they're supposed to, work against the tight maneuverability these sorts of games are known for.

The ship controls are one the main difficulties of this game. Your ship moves automatically so you can only steer left, right, thrust or break. Thrusting or breaking uses energy, which is automatically replenished over time. Firing can be automatic or manual. The ammo is limited and can be refilled by getting ammo dropped from enemies. You also have bombs, which destroys the majority of enemies on screen, but will also destroy items.\n\nThere is a wide variety of enemies, such as, meteorites, bombs, other ships and black holes. The enemies are not easy to hit due to the controls and some fire at you making it specially hard to get near. As the game goes on more and more enemies show up, some firing multiple bullets, which eventually turns the game into a bullet hell. Fortunally one good aspect of this game is that everything is very easy to distinguish, so there are no excuses, the game is just hard.\n\nThere is a wide variety of weapons, each with it's own pros and cons. Weapons show up randomly on screen. Some weapons shoot multiple bullets, others fire one powerful blast and others have special abilities like bouncing. Thrusting or breaking may change the weapon behavior. In particular the shield weapon rotates the shield faster or slower. You need to master every weapon to be proficient in this game. Of course can always use a bomb if the game gets to hard.\n\nFinally there are multiple ships. You can unlock ships by getting coins. Coins are randomly dropped by enemies. The best ship gives you faster firing rate, more lives, more bombs and more speed. However, note that faster firing rate also means that your ammo will run out faster, so at some point you need to go to manual firing. There are eight ships in total and later ships are just better than the previous. It is a linear upgrade system.\n\nThe game is arcade style, meaning that the real objective is to get high scores. The high scores are published online and count per ship and auto-firing option. I find this fair since both make a lot of difference. There aren't many acheivements in this game. One of the achievements is getting to 75k score but it is fairly easy to get there. It is small but fun.\n\nIn the latest version you can set the keys as you see fit. With the controller I recommend setting the D-Pad instead of the analog sticks because it is more precise. Better yet use the keyboard which is I find to be more precise than the gamepad. It is an experimental feature but I didn't find any issues with it.\n\nIt's a small fun arcade style game. I recommend it if you like these kinds of games.", "timestamp_created": 1487513061, "timestamp_updated": 1488655869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573092", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30023950": {"recommendationid": "30023950", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038038563", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500871361}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoy this game.

It gives the player a reason to get enough coins to unlock one other than a different ship sprite and slightly different stats. \nI really like that there is such a variety of content in such a simple game. Lots of different enemies, obstacles and powerups. My favourite powerups are the Fire/Laser ones(they act pretty similar to each other), the Homing one, and the Exploding one. The Magnet one is entirely detrimental in my opinion, however I don't think that having negative powerups is a bad thing, it makes avoiding them a challenge plus it gives you a reason to use the bombs, as it removes them from the screen. \nI didn't find much use for Autofire mode, I prefer to aim manually and only shoot when I think I'm on target rather than constantly spraying bullets.\nI think it would be really cool if the different ship types had mechanics entirely unique to each other; for example, different default firing type/rate, or the amount of ammo the ship can hold at once.\nDefinitely worth a play, especially at the price of a toilet roll.", "timestamp_created": 1486909475, "timestamp_updated": 1486909599, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29872273": {"recommendationid": "29872273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086806848", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508015909}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Muito legal pra um jogo que me custou cerca de 1 real.

Personally its only worth about 1 hours (4 if you are achievement hunting) of gameplay, only because its otherwise just a tedious grind up a leader board. To put things simply, here is a list of positives and negatives\n\nPOSITIVES:\n+ Switch between auto fire and manual fire is well apperciated. I hated auto-fire and I was glad to have gotten rid of it the second i could, but i am sure there are those who enjoy it.\n+ Enemies progress rather evenly and fairly, posing a learning curve that is rather simple in nature but more difficult to master entirely\n+ Having Fuel - It makes you have to think about your usage of speeding up and slowing down. Adds to the challange appropriately\n+ Panic Bombs - Panic Bombs are great in small amounts, as sometimes a situation gets a bit out of hand and its nice to slam.\n+ Leaderboard - If you are dedicated enough (like in the old arcades) to try to beat others, minues well find out where you have to be.\n+ There is a beta. The fact you are still updating it free off is probably the most admirable thing, even if it is tiny little updates.\n\nNEGATIVES\n- The ship upgrades are pretty much progress for the sake of progress. They don't add anything into the game really, not even on the leader boards, so picking the V8 is a given. Minus well start off with it.\n- Controls were learned quickly but some of the firing angles were a bit frustrating. I don't always expect to hit my target but its nice to be able to adjust and not miss fire off the sides.\n- Some of the weapons with manual fire are rather frustrating, as either they don't give a shot off immedietly in some cases (at least in magnet mode, if not two others).\n- It would be (in my opinion) nice if shields and bombs stacked past four. It is a rather shame when an upgrade passes by and I simply have no capability to utilize it when using a maxed ship. At least some extra room even with the top tier ship gives some bounses for going out of your way to get them.", "timestamp_created": 1485318411, "timestamp_updated": 1485318411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29475602": {"recommendationid": "29475602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119555956", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "last_played": 1516160124}, "language": "english", "review": "Boring.", "timestamp_created": 1485316897, "timestamp_updated": 1485316897, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.429986", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29468155": {"recommendationid": "29468155", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997506993", "num_games_owned": 802, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488164668}, "language": "english", "review": "Addictive and cheerful.

The visuals are primitive, but fit with the themes of the game, and the same can be said about its unsophisticated sound effects and retro-y soundtrack. Frankly, there is not a lot to say about them as they speak for themselves.\n\nAs the title might suggest, the gameplay involves controlling a ship which cannot stop and has to blast as many obstacles on the screen without touching any of them, their own laser blasts, or the edges of the screen. You can collect green blobs as ammo each time you destroy an obstacle and pick up a variety of outright crazy power-ups to enhance your survival. When your ship gets destroyed, you rinse and repeat. Other ships with different statistics (speed, shields, firepower, etc.) do become available by unlocking them with accumulated coins you might have collected from previous playthroughs. The goal is straightforward. Aim for the highest score by surviving the longest.\n\nThe controls are simple and intuitive, which is good news for a game like Bit Blast XL that focuses on quick reflexes. You use WASD or the arrow keeps to maneuver the ship and the Spacebar to drop a limited supply of bombs to eliminate everything on screen. The latter is a nifty new ability added after the 3.0 patch that gives the player some room to breathe once in a while (I will explain soon), although it does make the difficulty a tad easier than in the original version. You can also toggle in the options whether you want the ship to shoot automatically or manually if you want to preserve ammo.\n\nBut beware! Beneath Bit Blast XL\u2019s simplistic look lies a game which entails a good degree of swiftness, strategy and patience. While it is easy to get into, the difficulty surges over time with more obstacles and even hostile ships showing up on screen. Things heat up rapidly and the screen gets very cluttered. It gets pretty crazy, almost as if you are under LSD.\n\nIn the long run, playing Bit Blaster XL is like playing a conglomerated version of Space Invaders, Geometry Wars and Luftrausers. There is no denying that the game got a lot of inspiration and borrowed elements from the abovementioned games, but its execution is nearly-perfect. I cannot see any critical flaws with its gameplay, except that it might get tiresome after a long session. However, there is some element of addictiveness to it, especially if you are an OCD person.\n\nIn conclusion, Bit Blaster XL is a genuinely fun arcade game where you can play for as long as you want. Got 10 minutes to spare and have nothing else to do? Boot it up and blast everything in your path! There is no story nor pretentious vibe to it. Just pure fun gameplay like in the old days. The price tag, even at full price, makes this game a must-have. Highly recommend it! Personally, I suppose my only regret is having other priorities, as my playtime for such a fun little game is criminally low.\n\nBit Blaster XL is simply quite a\u2026blast!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=789141454", "timestamp_created": 1485215527, "timestamp_updated": 1485325117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.763963", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29450683": {"recommendationid": "29450683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319130666", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504570084}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego perfecto para pasar el tiempo y por solo un dolar.

It's one of the best soundtracks to a video game ever, and keep in mind, the person who made this game makes this game on his free time! It's super fun and not to mention diffucult (for me anyways). DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF IT IS NOT ON SALE! But not to worry, it goes on sale quite often, just put it on your wishlist and you will be notified. This game is also SUPER easy to run, no need of a beast gaming computer, a $200 notebook laptop would play this game great.\n\nPros:\n\n+Cheap\n+Fun\n+Amazing Soundtrack\n+Easy to run\n+Fun to play offline\n\nCons: (They are honestly not that big of a deal)\n\n-Can get boring sometimes\n\n\nGreat game!

[/h1]\n\nThere are many retro-esque games that merely mimic the art style, having gameplay that wasn't possible for the time, overdetailed models, and complicated controls. They don't have believable worlds and couldn't be on an 80's console due to the size. Retro games were all about simple games and concepts put into many levels. \n\nBit Blaster XL is amazing in creating the illusion that you're playing on an NES. The graphics are on point with the pixel theme, the music feels like an upgraded version of that of \"Space Invaders\", and the gameplay is golden.\n\nIn this game, you take control of a pixel spaceship, your goal is to destroy the enemy fleet which is invading your territory. You do this by collecting one of many powers to help you destroy astroids and ships. But be carefull! If you fly into the edge of the map you instantly die.\n\n[h1] Thoughts and Opnions [/h1]\n\nIn conclusion, Bit Blaster XL is a game that everybdy with over 15 minutes of time should play.

As for the gameplay, I wasn't focusing on things like replayability or storyline, since it has one task and one option: survive.  There isn't an actual storyline, however you can unlock new ships with different strengths/weaknesses.  Now, the soundtrack is composed of one or two songs, but I could listen to them all day.  The 8-Bit style of music fits with the game perfectly.  Overall, I would highly reccomend this game.

Definentally would recommend to anyone for full price, even though I got it on the winter sale. This game is wonderful. The gameplay, which is basically just running around in circles shooting balls that drop ammo, gets harder as the game progresses. Enemies start to appear, which shoot rockets at you. You start of with a shield, and after one hit, its gone. Then, if you take another hit, your done. You have to restart. Which, honestly, doesn't get repetitive, surprisingly. I've only gotten to around 4k score myself. There are many powerups in this game, such as a lightsaber to whack through the big balls, or grenades that spurt out little balls on impact. And, a little cool feature, coins that drop as you get farther in the game. With these coins, you can unlock different space ships. (You can't buy coins either, which is amazing. You actually have to play to unlock more space ships, which I think is a great feature. Non pay 2 win.)

Currently, only five of the fourteen upgrades are viable in the late game when bullet hell breaks loose:\n'laser,' arguably the strongest upgrade because it synergizes so well with the game's forced movement mechanic; 'flame,' a less accurate version of laser; 'shield,' the most fun upgrade because you become a spinning sphere of death (would be better than laser if you did'nt need to accelerate to activate it); 'homing,' only because it allows you to put 100% of your focus on dodging which usually leads to longer survival; 'blast,' the weakest of the viable upgrades and just a downgraded version of 'flame'. \nDue to this, I regularly found myself actively looking for one of the above which made it a bit repetitive. \n\nHowever, this is still an amazing arcade game for its price.

This will pop up a window and help you change the controls.\n\nWeirdly for the dpad on gamepads, when I had it available before, numerous people were running into problems where their ship would spin constantly without them touching the controller. Its on my list to sort this out, sorry for the inconveniance.\n\nThe other points are gameplay points that are specifically part of the game design so theres not much help I can offer there. I can only point out that my main goal was to replicate 80's arcade games while adding some modern touches. So its definitely a score chaser where you would put in quarter after quarter. :)\n\nI hope you find some more fun with my game.

Of course it doesn't cost much, so maybe that is why a lot of people are ok with it as is. Hopefully it will grow into the potential of a seriously great game.\n\nUpdate:\nMan, Adam the developer seems like a really great person. I honestly wrote the above thinking not a whole ot of it, since I don't really review games, and since there were SO many positive reviews that I just didn't understand. So I wrote it real quick, checked for spelling errors (which I still missed some) and clicked submit.\n\nBut wow, Adam wrote some very thoughtful and amazing comments below (you should definitely read) and then added some updates to the game. I mean, wow, again. That's the sign of someone who has some insanely great work ethic and a lot of pride in his product. I really admire that.\n\nBased on Adam's comments and some time spent in introspection, I'm flipping my recommendation. But I do have to say this: if you are expecting Egaroids or Asteroids from the old days, which I mistakenly did based on my limited research into the game (i.e. looking at the pics from the store page)...know that it is a different game. \n\nAnd with the updates from Adam, I can in good conscious say this: a seriously good game to play. \n\nThanks for being amazing Adam!

Bit Blaster XL is nearly a year old now, I think the positivity in the ratings come from the constant evolving of the game over time. If you don't like it now, you would have hated the much clunkier mess it was when I released it. Its my first solo outing on Steam and I have been adding/fixing things throughout the year at a pretty steady pace. You could spend an evening reading the mass ammounts of patch notes :) My end goal for BBXL is to have a solid and complete experience, and then use all I have learned in the last year to craft a bigger, better sequel from the ground up. Utilizing my new skills as well as many of the things the community have suggested as improvements/additions (like borderless arena) that just wouldn't be feasable in this version of the game.\n\nThere are a few more things I plan to implements before it hits one year old, including new music / sound sliders (heavily requested), re-bindable key in the game, and perhaps a few more gameplay related surprises.\n\nTo address your other concerns, there is currently a less than ideal way to rebind keys, as I just have yet to figure out how to implement it within my game. If you would like to tinker with rebinding keys, you can hold the \"ALT\" (on win) or \"OPTIONS\" (on osx) key or \"SHIFT\" (on Linux) and then press play in Steam to open the configuration window.\n\nThe coin drops will increase as you survive longer. The further you are in a round the better chance of coin drops. I found this to be a good balancing method based on increasing cost in ships plus increasing surivability of unlocked ships. \n\nHopefully you end up having some more fun with my game, sorry you didn't feel you could recommend it as a good value. \n\nHappy New Year!\n-Adam"}, "28854310": {"recommendationid": "28854310", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284558982", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507525358}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uac00\uc131\ube44 \uc81c\uc77c\uc88b\uc740 \uac8c\uc784 \ub531 \ub0b4 \uc2a4\ud0c0\uc77c \uc138\uc77c\ud560\ub54c \uc774\uac8c\uc784 \uaf2d\uc0ac\uc138\uc694", "timestamp_created": 1483155887, "timestamp_updated": 1483155887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28849189": {"recommendationid": "28849189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198331686673", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483301798}, "language": "english", "review": "Out of all the games I've bought just to collect, this one is a total gem.

Bit Blaster XL es un peque\u00f1o pero entretenido juego en el que manejamos una nave espacial en pleno campo de batalla; sencilla diversi\u00f3n estilo arcade de poco espacio y bajo precio.\n\nTenemos un \u00fanico modo de juego con tres reglas b\u00e1sicas: Dispara a los obst\u00e1culos, esquiva las balas enemigas y no golpees la pared. La meta es sumar la mayor cantidad de puntos antes de colisionar, aumentando la curva de dificultad conforme avanza la partida. Para la primera regla dispones de una variedad de proyectiles con caracter\u00edsticas diferentes, apareciendo de forma aleatoria por alguno de los lados en la pantalla. Para entregar alg\u00fan incentivo al jugador, est\u00e1 la posibilidad de comprar siete naves con monedas que surgir\u00e1n de los obst\u00e1culos destruidos, cada una de ellas con variables distintas entre los rasgos de velocidad, velocidad de disparo, cantidad de vidas y de bombas.\n\nEn el aspecto visual, el juego presenta una apariencia retro con tonos grises, reservando gran parte del color a los \u00edtems que servir\u00e1n para recargar nuestra munici\u00f3n, los proyectiles y las monedas. Esto logra que el jugador no se pierda entre escenario, caracteres y proyectiles. M\u00e1s alla de eso, no esperes gran variedad, el dise\u00f1o de enemigos es limitado y el escenario no var\u00eda. \n\nLa m\u00fasica es su punto m\u00e1s fuerte, y lo ser\u00eda m\u00e1s si se dispusiera de todas las canciones durante la partida, pero los desarrolladores han tomado la decisi\u00f3n de otorgar una pista a cada nave conseguida. Por lo mismo, el incre\u00edble trabajo musical que se ha hecho, el cual acompa\u00f1a de forma excelente al estilo visual pixelado, puede llegar a resultar cansino si se dedica a una sola nave para conseguirlas a todas. Se recomienda ir variando para aprovechar la totalidad del soundtrack.\n\nEcho en falta algunos elementos que podr\u00edan expandir la experiencia. La incorporaci\u00f3n de un modo con misiones, variedad de mapas o multijugador (2 jugadores en modo local u online) habr\u00edan sido ideales para entregar m\u00e1s horas de juego. Los logros de Steam pueden acabarse en unas 3 o 5 horas si eres h\u00e1bil (no me incluyo), pero por el precio, sin contar la rebaja que alcanza en ofertas, sigue siendo una buena cantidad de tiempo.\n\nCon todo esto, Bit Blaster XL es un juego recomendable si quieres una opci\u00f3n entretenida para darle unas pocas horas intensivas y, una vez compradas las naves y ganados los logros, poder dar una que otra visita en los periodos de ocio para superar tus marcas personales, as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n las del ranking global.", "timestamp_created": 1483142141, "timestamp_updated": 1483291992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565482", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28846242": {"recommendationid": "28846242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084740195", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507927965}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, cheap and addictive... lmao", "timestamp_created": 1483136715, "timestamp_updated": 1483136715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28842787": {"recommendationid": "28842787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133718789", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485002839}, "language": "polish", "review": "Dobra gierka dla zabicia czasu :D", "timestamp_created": 1483130408, "timestamp_updated": 1483130408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28842269": {"recommendationid": "28842269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176495082", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490284194}, "language": "english", "review": "the best game on steam", "timestamp_created": 1483129519, "timestamp_updated": 1511009976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28837260": {"recommendationid": "28837260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067252771", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483233226}, "language": "swedish", "review": "simple and fun", "timestamp_created": 1483121063, "timestamp_updated": 1483121063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28835245": {"recommendationid": "28835245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023541561", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511278338}, "language": "english", "review": "gr8 - 8/8 m8", "timestamp_created": 1483117331, "timestamp_updated": 1483117331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466708", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28835050": {"recommendationid": "28835050", "author": {"steamid": "76561198226905740", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513888148}, "language": "german", "review": "F\u00fcr ein Spiel welches \"gerade mal\" 1\u20ac  (im Sale gerade 50cent) kostet, lohnt es sich wirklich.\nDie Musik passt und ist abwechslungreich, es gibt (ohne zuviel zu verraten) verschiedene Raumschiffe mit jeweils anderen Stats desweiteren ingame verschiedene Items (oder wie man es nennt) welche die Waffe des Raumschiffes verbessert oder andersweitig n\u00fctzlich sind.\nIch empfehle das Spiel wirklich auch wen es manchmal etwas schwierig ist macht es trotzdem Spa\u00df. :)", "timestamp_created": 1483117028, "timestamp_updated": 1483117028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502058", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28829872": {"recommendationid": "28829872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050326171", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483107489}, "language": "french", "review": "Bit Blaster XL est un excellent shooter 2D !\n\"Live Die Retry !\" est un tr\u00e8s bon slogan pour ce jeu.\n\nEn effet, celui-ci nous fait penser aux bons vieux jeux d'arcade de l'\u00e9poque et on prend plaisir \u00e0 y rejouer encore et encore jour apr\u00e8s jour !

I played it on a Mac (since that's all I have while I'm away), and the controls are utter crap without a joystick.  I can't use the arrow keys and shoot at the same time, probably because the firing key is Control.  And unbeknownst to me, control + left arrow on a Mac takes you to the dashboard--even in the middle of the game!  And you have to press Control + Option to fire a bomb, because that key is Alt, which is much more accessible on a Windows machine than on a Mac.\n\nWhat that basically means is I'm stuck using the \"autofire\" mode, which is still fun enough, but much harder to sustain as you progress.  Especially when you get those sweet ships with the fast rate of fire.  On autofire mode, those ships aren't very useful since they run out of ammo so fast.

You are, but, a Bit Blaster ship with fininite amount of ammo, shooting down enemies that could destroy you in one shot/touch all while picking up ammo/coins that slowly gravitate towards you, power ups that [could] change how you shoot down said enemies, and sometimes a shield/bomb/boost to help you last just a bit longer to surpass your own score and beyond...\n\nThe store page's description of the game (as of Ver. 3.0) is about as accurate as it sounds! The more you play, the more coins you could collect overall to buy the next [better] Bit Blaster ship and so on and so forth... Each ship carries their own strengths and weaknesses in size, speed, rate of auto fire, and initial shield-to-bomb ratio at the beginning of each round... Depending on one's own playstyle, you may gravitate to certain ship versions more than others once you do unlock all of the Bit Blaster ship versions...\n\nNow, at the time of this review, this game for only 0.99 USD seems like the most perfect game within its own genre... In a way, it does suceeed in using its own throwback aesthetic to its advantage while also changing it up a bit with the concept of fininte ammo and now almost-screen-clearing bombs you can activate manually... However, on a more personal note, the game could not recognize my Steam Controller outside of the game's [controller] rumble feature (thus resorting to me playing this game with a PS3 controller binded with 360 controls controller-wise)... Also, despite it's easy-to-play-hard-to-master gameplay, all of the power ups and potential shield/bomb/boost pickups appear at random (just like the enemies only without a pending visual cue), thus finding that one power up/pickup to appear on the screen that you know will give you that [better] edge may not happen soon enough and/or appear too soon to react to it effectively...\n\nRegardless, this game is still fun for the price and still has means to improve like the previous versions of this game! If you are a fan of arcade shooters like [i]Asteriods[/i] (for the obvious comparison/example) or the first few [i]Geometry Wars[/i] games, then it's worth putting some time into... I mean, most of the achievements are prety easy-ish to get, there's Steam Trading Cards (if you're into that sort of thing), and the soundtrack is FREE after purchase! Also, you don't have to wait for a [pending] Steam Sale becuase it's cost [less than] a US dollar in general!", "timestamp_created": 1481878911, "timestamp_updated": 1481879473, "voted_up": true,

It has pixelated graphics (the good type of pixelated graphics), and different music for each different space ship. I'm personally a sucker for any game with unlockable characters/abilities and powerups, this game has both. Also, the game has a variety of ways to control the spaceship; the mouse, arrows, wasd, and you can use controllers, this is a nice little touch so that anyone can play the game the way they please. Overall, I liked this game, there are a few downsides though; even with the powerups the gameplay is very simple, making it repetitive. The controls are good, but the way the spaceship works isn't as good, you can't strafe, you can only shoot where your moving towards and you can't stop your spaceship, although you can slow it down. I think adding completely different game modes, and in those new game modes adding a different movement system could help make the game better.\n\nThe game is relatively cheap.

Bit Blaster is the first game for the \"BUDGET BUY\" reviews. You can purchase Bit Blaster XL for 99 cents (USD) but is usually on sale for 49 cents (USD).\n\nBit Blaster is a fun game which I would recommend buying for a game to play when you want to relax. There are 12 different power ups you can collect while in game which all have different capabilities. The power ups are very interesting but some are too underpowered and should be fixed. There are around 6-7 different ships that you can unlock, these also all have different capabilities. Some of the ships are on the tanky side so they survive longer, some are quicker etc.\n\nI think if Nickervision studios added a multiplayer function to the game it would sell a lot more copies as it is a really cheap game and is very fun. I don't know if this would be easy for Nickervision Studios to add this to the game but I think this would boost the popularity of the game a lot. The peak of players this game has in the average 24 hours is around 30.\n\nThe gameplay is reasonably smooth, the graphics are not obviously the best because it is a 2D arcade shooter but they are acceptable for a game like this. This game is also available for IOS and ANDROID if you want to play the game on the go for free, the PC version is a lot better though.  \n\nBit Blaster XL is a fun game which was made by a small developer. I would like to see Nickervision Studios produce more games as this one is a great game. I definitely recommend this game, it is just a chilled out fun game which I think you would be able to play it for around 30 hours. For the price it is a must buy!\n\nOVERALL SCORE\n\n7/10\n\n-marra", "timestamp_created": 1477988402, "timestamp_updated": 1477988402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570911", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26341981": {"recommendationid": "26341981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117335423", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478312845}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun for 20 minutes at a time.", "timestamp_created": 1477942435, "timestamp_updated": 1477942435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26341732": {"recommendationid": "26341732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066952727", "num_games_owned": 425, "num_reviews": 360, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477940707}, "language": "english", "review": "nice little arcade game to play to kill some time", "timestamp_created": 1477941474, "timestamp_updated": 1477941474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464602", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26336395": {"recommendationid": "26336395", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272228573", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496686871}, "language": "german", "review": "Sehr gutes Spiel", "timestamp_created": 1477922155, "timestamp_updated": 1477922155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484456", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26330828": {"recommendationid": "26330828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008466637", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513992360}, "language": "english", "review": "Very addictive, well designed, beautifully simple, extremely playable game.\n[list]\n[*]Every round is totally different;\n[*]Power-ups are creative and keep things fresh;\n[*]Love being able to unlock additional ships, I'm a few hours in and still have ships to unlock;\n[*]Really simple to play, but always leaves me feeling like \"Just one more round, I know I can beat that score...\";\n[*]Great game to pick up and play when you got a little downtime, bonus for being cross platform;\n[*]Controller support out of the box;\n[/list]\n\nProbably not intended by the developer, but also makes a great drinking game.

The movement is fluid and the graphics look cool but what stands out to me is the sound design: the music is very good and makes you strive to survive and keep going, the sound effects are perfect, giving you that rewarding feeling when you grab a coin or blow up stuff. There is enough variety in the ships you unlock to make playing with each a slightly different experience. Game keeps challenging your mind and focus, as you have to watch out for collisions and be careful not to run out of ammo while aiming and controlling the speed.

The other problems were visible as soon as I booted the game up. I'm using a dualshock 4 with DS4Windows, which works fine on every other game, I also tried it without the software and it worked just as badly. B was activating B and X and X was activating X and A, as well as quitting the game randomly. Not a great first impression. Luckily that seems to be the only problem with mapping but as the dualshock 4 isn't officially supported with windows then I'm willing to let that slide, even if the game has broken native support for it and 360 controller users have had the same issue. Actually playing the game, isn't much better with an unresponsive and slow turning system, even on a keyboard, leading to multiple deaths as I was trying to figure out how fast the turning was going to be on that round as the turning speed seems almost entirely random between rounds. Another issue is that after you click play and it loads up (an almost instant loading time as expected) the ship automatically takes off as normal, the problem is that you dont gain any control for about a second. This is a much larger issue than it seems as you will most likely want to turn as soon as you get into the game to get powerups for instance. But you can't.\n\n Fortuanately the rest of the game seems well enough made to get away with its price (I did pick this up on sale for 51% off bringing the price to 39p ($0.49) from 79p ($0.99)). While the powerups look well made, the sprites for the ship and the enemies look like cheap assets, but that's an overlookable issue. The 8-bit art style works well for it although the whole UI and all of the sprites looked like they were slightly blurred, like they were a much lower resolution then they should be. As for the menu's, they have clear controller prompts which for some reason don't change to keyboard prompts when a controller is disconnected. Later I realised the reason is because the buttons are the same. To go to the play screen a gamepad would use the A button, but on a keyboard, where enter, spacebar or the mouse (you can use the mouse by the way) would be used, the A button on the keyboard is used. The same applies for going back in the menu's, both the gamepad and the keyboard use the B button, I don't understand why, Is it just so the developer can save on assets by using the same ones? But something that confused me more was that you can't use the sticks on a controller in the menu's. Instead, all the menu's (apart from the ship select) uses the face buttons. On the keyboard and mouse, you can use the mouse to navigate the menu's (the right choice), or you can fumble around the keyboard pressing the A, B, X and Y keys all on different areas of the keyboard.\n\nI understand that this is a game made by a small company (it even says so when you exit the game) and that they are trying to make games in their spare time so I've tried making this review as helpful as possible. I hope this game is fixed but in its current state it isn't very good, despite the reviews. There will be plenty of people who like this game but I'm not one of them. I don't have an issue with any bugs that I have found but instead with repeated poor design choices such as the movement being slow and sluggish (this can easily be fixed while also making the game much faster paced by using a twin stick control layout where the left stick moves the ship around and the right stick fires in whichever direction the stick is facing, and by using WSAD as movement and the mouse as turning with left click as fire) and weirdly made menu's.\n\n\n\n[Update]\nThere are still issues with DS4 inputs causing incorrect commands, but if you use a program like DS4 windows and enable \"Hide DS4 Controller\" the game works fine.\nOther than that and one or two minor bugs the latest patch has added an explosion ability which is useful for decluttering the screen, (even if I forget to use it), and now the menus look a lot better. New music has been added which sounds good and fits the game very well, and it's also available as free DLC which is nice. I learnt the slow turning times are fixed when new ships are unlocked, some turn slower and some turn faster, that's just part of the game. It seems all resolution issues have been fixed as well, and once you've put some time into the game it gets a lot better, so now I recommend this game, especially for the price.", "timestamp_created": 1475705735, "timestamp_updated": 1482454188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1482097465, "developer_response": "Hey, I recently put out a big patch bringing the version to 3.0.

Over time you unlock new ships that behave a little differently (more hp, speed and firing speed you get the idea) and they have unique music theme. And there are weapon pickups, which spice up the gameplay a little bit. The controls however seem to be a little funky from time to time (I swear sometimes my spaceship refuses to steer).\n\nIt's not brilliant, but considering it's price, I don't think anyone would expect otherwise.", "timestamp_created": 1475703433, "timestamp_updated": 1475703474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25875518": {"recommendationid": "25875518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028436082", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486923304}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a simple, funny and adictive arena shooting game.

If you like this try Waves. \n\nI only have a few complaints in that a ship lasts for a short time. The screen quickly gets crowded with enemies and thier missiles and you won't survive a hit with a wall or more than a couple impacts so you're constantly starting over. Its very easy to steer into a wall when things get hectic and that usually ends the game. Some of the missiles fired by enemies are the same color as missiles fired by your own ship which is unnecessarily confusing. \n\nAfter only a few hours of gameplay I already have owned all the ships available for a couple of hours. It doesn't have to be that short of a game. \n\nThey let you select auto fire or manual fire but they only let you use the X button on your x box controller for PC. That isn't very practical since you're using a and b heavily to speed up and slow down your ship. It would be nice if you could use a trigger button or shoulder button. More programmable buttons is what I'm saying. Give the customer lots of options to come up with the ideal configuration.

The crosshair is actually the fire rate, and the dev pointed out that there is a powerup legend in the pause menu (which I had never opened before now).\n\nThe other problem is the inconsistant progression system. Ships are purchased using coins that seemingly randomly drop from enemies-I've gone ten games without seeing a single coin and suddenly find 3 in the eleventh. I think a progression system that relies less on luck could greatly benefit this game.\n\nOverall, I think the game is pretty ok. To me, it feels like this game is sitting in the uncomfortable position between PC game and mobile game- it's too simplistic to be a good PC game, but it's clearly designed for computers (I can't imagine how the controls would work on a phone or tablet).

I have been periodically going back to it to see whats new with the updates and whatnot and now I have been pushed over the edge in giving this one a positive review since the amount of pollish and work put into this is worth a purchase on its own.\n\nI do have a few nitpicks, enemies don't seem to have a telegraph for their shooting, on more than one occasion i have been shot by an enemy that I just  killed because their was no tell for when they would shoot. Additionally since the game is score based, there isnt much insentive to shoot asteroids since ammo drops give you an increase in score as well, patient players can just bide their time picking up ammo drops to increase their score, I think this behaviour should be discouraged, maybe just by taking away the score increase for the ammo drops.\n\nBut these are minor gripes and the average player will have fun with this game regardless, you will definitely get your \u00a3- per-hour here so do yourself a favour and consider buying.

Similar to the retro Asteroids game from the 1980's but your eight Ships and these Special Ammo abilities that will help you achieve highscore.  Each Ship is different of their fire speed, movement speed, and the number of shields they have.  You start with your first ship (Bit Blaster V1) and you have to find coins by destroying asteroids and enemy ships to unlock more Ships.  The Special Ammo abilities you get by collecting them during the round will increase your ammunition but they take up more bullets than your Regular Ammo.  You lose the Special Ammo by running out of ammo.  You collect more ammo by destroying asteroids and enemy ships.  These Special Ammo are: Blast (creates a wide spread for a short range; takes away 6 bullets per shot), Bounce (big bullets that bounce off the edge of the map and hit an enemy; takes away 3 bullets per shot), Explode (a bullet that detonates on impact or a couple seconds after launched, creating a blast radius and hit multiple targets; takes away 2 bullets per shot), Giant (a large bullet that explode on impact and launch four smaller bullets; takes away 4 bullets per shot), Homing (bullets that home in on enemies; takes away 3 bullets per shot), Laser (a laser that fires at a short distance that will obliterate enemies; takes away 2 bullets per second), Mirror (this will activate the rear cannon creating mirror shots; takes away 2 bullets per shot), Magnet (this activates the magnet that will pull in ammo and coins scattered around in the crossfire; takes away 2 bullets per second), Rapid (fires the cannon faster than normal; takes away 1 bullet per shot), Shields (forms bigger shield and destroys anything it hits; takes away 4 bullets per second), Spread (creates a tight spread for longer range; takes away 3 bullets per shot), Through (bullets that will go through enemies ensuring multiple kills; takes away 3 bullets per shot).", "timestamp_created": 1469155952, "timestamp_updated": 1469158489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1493338601, "developer_response": "Hey, thanks for your support, so happy to see you enjoyed my game!

I'm very surprised that it isn't free. It really should be. Even on sale this is not worth the price, even at such a low price.\n \n*new review*\nThe game to me is boring. It lacks body, not exactly filling. I'd say it gives a few minutes of entertainment at best and then you'll never play it again, or at least thats what I did. I was surprised it wasn't free, becuase it is something I would have guessed would have been. \n\nThat being said, the developer is the reason I would give this a good review. He's a good guy that cares about the gamer's experience. First thing he did when he saw that I was not a fan of his game is offer a refund.

Random powerups spawn and give you all sorts of fun enhancements - bouncing bullets, shotguns, behind-the-back attacks, bombs, etc.  You just keep playing until you die and keep trying to make the highest score.\n\nUnlike Asteroids you are always moving and can only slow your ship down at the cost of using your boost meter.  If you run out of ammo you're left vulnerable so always keep track of how much you have left.  Different weapons use different amounts of ammo.\n\nI look forward to seeing more from this author.

You start out with the first basic ship and gain the ability to buy new ones with coins you recieve as drops from kills. There are a nice amount of ships for the game, since the game is so small, you dont really need many anyway. You will be focused on not only your score, but unlocking more ships as well as the achievements the game has to offer. Do i recommend this game? Yes. This game is a nice little time killer that is really addicting when you really get into it. At the time of writing this, the game is on sale for 49 cents but the original price is only 99 cents.

Then this game is for you! With its Asteroid style gameplay, you'll be sure to love this! However, even though the game is magnificent there are some slight problems which could be fixed to make it even better which I'll outline in my Pros and Cons below:\n\nPros:\n\n\u2666 Hours of gameplay for the low price of $1 (You definitely get your money's worth)\n\u2666 Has Trading Cards\n\u2666 Awesome Number of Achievements gotten for just playing the game (You don\u2019t have to do anything special to get these, just play the game)\n\u2666 Controls seem to be responsive and work as intended (Pressing the button seems to do what is intended and work very well) \n\u2666 Decent variation and number of powerups (Not one powerup seems similar to the last and their seems to be a decent number to always keep the game interesting) \n\u2666 Decent variation of enemies (This is decent because  when you progress it doesn\u2019t feel like you are versing the same select enemies over and over again as more types seem to come in the longer you are alive)\n\u2666 Nice number of balanced unlockable playable ships \n\u2666 Eargasmic Music and Sound Effects that fit the bullet hell scene and make it feel intense whilst you are playing and makes you want to keep playing\n\u2666 Graphics are stunning for the genre\n\u2666 Everything seems balanced and works off skill more than the power of something (For example, a better ship or weapon upgrade doesn\u2019t always mean you\u2019ll do better, as the game relies on skill)\n\u2666 Two modes to suite everyone\u2019s playstyle (Auto-Fire and Non-Auto-Fire which means if you want to really test your skill you can or if you want to casually play you can) \n\u2666 Old School look and feel is on point (If you ever played old school pixel, bullet hell games, this is a very good representation. For example, if you played Asteroids, you will love this)\n\u2666 Very Good at being both a casual or uncasual game (If you have spare time and just want to casually play something this game works perfectly or if you want to go for a highscore and beat your friends this works perfectly too)\n\u2666 Difficulty seems scaled correctly (I say this as the longer you play the harder it gets without being too easy at the start or too hard at the end. It feels like you ease into harder stages without actually realising which is decent)\n\u2666 PC Option Menu that seems to work (Decent for what it is)\n\u2666 Remapable controls (This is amazing as we can easily and quickly change the keys to whatever button we want)\n\nCons:\n\u2666 No incentive to switch powerups unless needing extra ammo (This is annoying as I didn\u2019t really feel ammo was a problem and some powerups suited me better than others, so why switch?)\n\u2666 Powerups don\u2019t stack (This seems weird as I would have thought that collecting more than one of the same powerup would have stacked and upgraded it to a certain point, instead collecting more more than one of the same powerup only gives you ammo and nothing else)\n\u2666 Some people who don\u2019t like this gamestyle may find it very repetitive (This is because there is no levels and not much variation from each time you click play)\n\u2666 Steam highscores don't seem to go off mode or ship (This is really bad as someone can play any ship and auto-fire and be registered on Steam with the same score as someone who played non-auto-fire. Steam highscores should be done like ingame highscores by fire mode and ship)\n\nOverall, the game is one of the best Pixelated, Old School, Bullet Hell games that I\u2019ve ever played on Steam. Even though there are lots of cons, the pros still outweigh the cons as the cons are only minor things which I believe would help improve the game. Therefore, if you like Old School games like Asteroids, then you\u2019ll love this and at the low price of $1.00, you can\u2019t go wrong!\n\nPS: It also seems the Developers read the reviews, which is good. I had listed in my Cons things like obvious Steam highscores hacking and no PC resolution mode. Since listing these in my Cons the obviously hacked highscores have been removed and a PC resolution mode has been added.

First pick a classic genre, in this case space shooters.  Pick a gimmick or two to make your game stand out from other similar titles.  Finally, give the player a some motivation to continue playing beyond just for high-scores.  One easy way to achieve this is via a light progression system.  Bring all that together like this game does and you're destined for success.\n\nThe developer's motto \"live, die, retry\" becomes quite apparent very quickly.  Bit Blaster is a space shooter similar the classic Asteroids.  There are various meteors, bombs, and spaceships coming at you from both sides of the screen.  The longer you survive the more stuff gets thrown at you.  Its usually not much more than two or three minutes till you're overwhelmed and you're ship is destroyed.  You'll want to keep jumping right back into the action because with the aid of the various weapons you'll know there is potential to do better.\n\nThe weapon and ammo system is one of the features that really stands out about this game.  You have one ammo base that carries across for all the different weapons including your standard gun.  In order to get more ammo you'll either have to pick it up from destroying the objects around you or grabing new weapons.  Once you pick up a weapon you're stuck with it unless your ship gets hit, runs out of ammo, or you pick up a different weapon.  There are classic weapons like rapid fire, scattershot, and homing missiles as well as unique ammo that either explodes, bounces, or tears through multiple enemies.\n\nTo help keep you motivated you earn coins as you play which will unlock you new ships.  The first couple ships offer a specific selling points such as extra speed or multiple shields.  As you unlock the later ships they are pretty much straight up upgrades of previous models.  By the end of the game there will probably just one or two clear favorites you usually stick with if you choose to keep playing.  There is some incentive to go back to the other ships as each has their own leader-boards for high-scores.\n\nEither you like retro space shooters or you don't.  If you do Bit Blaster is definitely worth checking out.  The various weapons and ships make it quite an enjoyable game that can be hard to put down.  Since it is rather light you may not be very motivated to keep playing after unlocking all the ships but you'll still have had enough fun up to that point to have made the purchase worth wild.

Man versucht um jeden Preis, mit Nichts und Niemandem zu kollidieren.\nGenau das sollen solche Spiele bewirken.\n\n[h1] Spielfunktionen: [/h1]\n\nAls ich zu spielen begann, erwartete ich einen einfachen Asteroids-Klon, was ich bekam, war etwas ganz anderes.\nDas Spiel mag auf den ersten Blick einfach sein, aber so viel Content erwartet man bei den wenigsten Spielen dieser Preisklasse.\n\nEs gibt zwei \"Schwierigkeitsstufen\":\n\nAuto-Shoot und Nicht Auto-Shoot.\nDer unterschied besteht darin, dass im einen Modus die nur begrenzte Munition einfach wild herausgeballert wird und im anderen mit einer weiteren Taste geschossen werden muss.\n\nTastenbelegung und Steuerung: \n\nDas Spiel wird im Auto-Shoot Modus mit drei Tasten gespielt (A, D f\u00fcr die Steuerung des Raumschiffs, Leertaste f\u00fcr den Booster). Wahlweise kann auch mit Gamepad gespielt werden.\n\nIm zweiten Modus wird das Spiel zus\u00e4tzlich mit Strg gespielt, welche f\u00fcr das abfeuern der Munition ben\u00f6tigt wird.\n\nDie Steuerung ist anfangs bei jedem einzelnen Raumschiff gew\u00f6hnungsbed\u00fcrftig, aber nach ein paar Toden, hat man den Dreh raus.\n\n\nJedes Raumschiff hat in jedem Modus einen eigenen Score, den es zu \u00fcbertreffen gilt, hierbei helfen massenhaft PowerUps. (z.B. Schild, verschiedene Feuermodi, Waffen, Munition).\n\nEs gibt viele verschiedene Gegner, von denen sich auch einige zur Wehr setzen k\u00f6nnen.\n\nManche Gegner lassen Coins fallen. Wenn man eine gewisse Anzahl an Coins gesammelt hat, kann man sich neue Raumschiffe kaufen.\n\nDas Men\u00fc ist phantastisch gestaltet!\nEs ist auf den ersten Blick klar ersichtlich, was einen erwartet, feindliche Raumschiffe fliegen gegen den Titel und die verschiedenen Reiter und explodieren in einem wei\u00dfen Schwall aus Pixeln.\n\u00c4u\u00dferst detailreich, alleine das Men\u00fc k\u00f6nnte auf Steam verkauft werden!\n\nDas einzige, was mir im Men\u00fc gefehlt hat, war die Interaktivit\u00e4t.\nEinfach vor Spielbeginn ein bisschen auf die visualisierten Inhalte ballern und damit ein wenig \u00fcben, bevor es dann zur Sache geht.\n\n[h1] Grafik: [/h1]\n\nDas Spiel ist, wie es sich f\u00fcr Retro-Spiele dieser Art geh\u00f6rt, in PixelArt gehalten, sch\u00f6ner, kann man ein solches Spiel nicht mit PixelArt gestalten.\n\n[h1] \u00dcbersetzung: [/h1]\n\nEine deutsche \u00dcbersetzung fehlt, diese w\u00e4re jedoch auch \u00dcberfl\u00fcssig und zu viel Arbeit. Das Spielprinzip, die Steuerung und alles andere k\u00f6nnte auch ohne jegliche Verschriftlichung leicht verstanden werden.\n\n[h1] Musik: [/h1]\n\nDie Musik ist faszinierend, der Entwickler muss lange Zeit daran gesessen haben.\nEs handelt sich hierbei um mehrere 8-bit Endlosschleifen, die weder nerven, noch langweilig werden.\n\nJedes Raumschiff hat seinen eigenen Track.\n\n[h1] Innovation: [/h1]\n\nIst dieses Spiel Innovativ? \n\nGab es sowas \u00e4hnliches schon vorher?\n\nWiedersprechen sich diese Fragen, wenn beide positiv beantwortet werden?\n\nDie Antwort lautet DREI MAL JA!\n\nEinfach, weil wir alle diese Art von Spielen kennen, jeder kennt das Spielprinzip, jeder wei\u00df, wie es funktioniert.\n\nDie Innovation liegt hier im Detail. Kleinste Ver\u00e4nderungen, die viele \u00e4hnliche Spiele von fr\u00fcher in den Schatten stellen.\n\n[h1] Spielspa\u00df: [/h1]\n\nBit Blaster XL ist an Spielspa\u00df kaum zu \u00fcbertreffen.\nDas Spiel hat einfach alles, was es braucht. Und mehr!\n\nMehr m\u00f6chte ich zum Spielspa\u00df nicht sagen, das Spiel spricht einfach f\u00fcr sich.\n\n[h1] Preis/Leistung: [/h1]\n\nEin bessere Preis/Leistungs-Verh\u00e4ltnis kann sich der K\u00e4ufer gar nicht vorstellen. \nEine Tonne vollgestopft mit Content und die Angst von diesem Spiel s\u00fcchtig zu werden... Und das f\u00fcr weniger als einen Euro?!\n\nDer Entwickler k\u00f6nnte Bit Blaster XL f\u00fcr das 10-fache verkaufen, ohne mit schlechten Kritiken rechnen zu m\u00fcssen.\n\nIch bin auf jeden Fall froh, dieses Spiel in meiner Bibliothek zu haben und kann es nur weiterempfehlen.\n\n\n[h1] Spielfunktion: 8/10\nAtmosph\u00e4re:        7/10\nGrafik:                  7/10 [/h1]\n[h1] Innovation:   5/10\nMusik:                  8/10\nSpielspa\u00df:          10/10\nPreis/Leistung:  10/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] [h1] Gesamtpunktzahl: 8/10  [/h1]\nEin Indie-Meisterwerk!\n\nOmakoma over and out!", "timestamp_created": 1465476745, "timestamp_updated": 1465480228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574879", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23466166": {"recommendationid": "23466166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117597630", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509215263}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is the proof that less is more!

A proposta \u00e9 ser casual, desafiante e fren\u00e9tico.

As balas acabam r\u00e1pido no modo autom\u00e1tico, mas voc\u00ea poder\u00e1 colet\u00e1-las no cen\u00e1rio o tempo todo para evitar a chegada do momento em que haver\u00e3o muitos inimigos e, sem balas, voc\u00ea certamente morrer\u00e1. Se voc\u00ea bater em uma nave inimiga, voc\u00ea morre. Se vc colidir com os cantos do cen\u00e1rio, vc morre. Se tu levar bala dos inimigos, tu morre. Se destruires o inimigo e ele se despeda\u00e7ar e um dos peda\u00e7os te acertar, adivinhem s\u00f3: tu morre tamb\u00e9m. \n\nO jogo n\u00e3o \u00e9 f\u00e1cil. \u00c9 divertido, desafiante e cumpre bem o papel a que se prop\u00f5e.

D\u00e1 pra jogar no mouse, mas eu achei a jogabilidade meio ruim nele. D\u00e1 pra usar as setas do teclado (o que eu uso) ou um controle de xbox (movimentos no anal\u00f3gico). Existe uma outra tecla de jogabilidade que serve para ativar o turbo (o controle vibra quando voc\u00ea ativa o turbo), que serve apenas pra voc\u00ea movimentar a nave um pouco mais r\u00e1pido. \n\nO cen\u00e1rio, embora no v\u00eddeo possa parecer meio polu\u00eddo e at\u00e9 meio sem l\u00f3gica, \u00e9 de f\u00e1cil compreens\u00e3o e os muitos itens que surgem nele n\u00e3o atrapalham na jogabilidade pois s\u00e3o bem representados por cores e formatos diferenciados. \n\nVoc\u00ea encontra um item que serve como moeda dentro do jogo. Voc\u00ea usa ele pra comprar outras naves. N\u00e3o destravei todas, ent\u00e3o, n\u00e3o irei detalhar o que cada uma tem de vantagem sobre a outra.

No, wait! There's a new update for BIT Blaster! Again!\"\n\nThis review is for the version 2.10 of the game.\n\nGraphics: 30%\nAudio: 30%\nGameplay: 60%\nReplayability: 80%\nValue for money: 100%\nOverall: 60%\n\nAbout the scores: In shoot'em ups/bullet hell, I feel the visual- and audio presentation is as important as the gameplay. You need a catchy tune and some real cool graphics to really get the adrenaline pumping. That is why I weight all 5 scores similar.\n\nThe first time I played this game, I was not impressed, to say the least. The graphics were dull, the music did not fit the game, and the sound effects needed work. This is still the case. The gameplay was not very engaging, and the controls were not optimal. That, on the other hand has changed... a lot!\n\nAnd maybe the constant changes and additions is what makes me play this game over and over again. Even though I gave it such a low score. Because, as a game, I feel the price tag is about right. You get your moneys' worth. It might be engaging for 10 minutes. Then you put it away and forget about it. Unless you try to unlock all the ships. But since I wrote the intial review, the developer has been in constant dialogue with me, improving the parts that me and the other players pointed out. Implementing ideas, and makes the game evolve over time. That is very interesting to be a part of. Personally, I feel Steam is not the arena for developing a game. I require a finished product, when I buy something from steam. But that time is probably in the past.\n\nSo what do you get if you buy this game? It's a shoot'em up with simple graphics. The controls are tight. The ships have diffrent stats, but not much more different than that. It's a single difficulty/level with increasing numbers of enemies over time. And powerups.

That's the main thing everyone seems to say in this game's favor. \"Well, it didn't cost me anyhting!\"\n\nI wanted to like this game but found it simplistic, unenjoyably limited, and lacking strategy. The game artificially limits you in ways that games like Asteroids (yeah, that one, from the 1980s) doesn't. Let that sink in for a moment. \n\nIn this game, you are constantly moving forward. You cant stop or vary your speed below the minimum threshold of thrust/velocity. The only thing you can do is boost to further speed up, but once you unlock the 2nd ship, it's already too fast even without boost. \n\nThis causes a problem with another limitation that Asteroids didn't have - in Bit Blaster, if you touch the edges of the screen, you die instantly, rather than wrapping around to the other side (you know, a feature that is actually fun). \n\nFinally, in this game you are forced to constantly shoot at an automated rate, which removes all strategy from aiming and placing precise shots, and is further compounded by the fact that ammo is severely limited and once you run out, you literally cant fire at anything until you pick up more ammo, which drops as loot from things that you destroy (see the catch 22?). \n\nI guess other people like those features but to me they are pointless limitations that ruin any sense of strategy or fun.

The fantastic pixel art blends perfectly with the really catchy music that chirps away as you blast astriods and enemy spaceships. \n\nThe sense of progression is simple, as it should be in this retro style game, and doesn't feel overwhelmingly grindy - although it is essentially what you're doing. The weapons really stand out too - Some are your average three-way bullets, or your slightly bigger ones - but there are some really intuitive weapons too. My personal favourite is the lazor sword, which is bloody perfect as long as you manage your ammo.\n\nOh - This game also has ammo. Yeah, it's an odd mechanic to add into an endless shooter like this, but it works really well. You can have your shooting set to automatic, which is really handy when you just want to focus on getting out of annoying situations, but I prefer to play with this turn off. One addition that I feel would really help the game feel much smoother would be the ability to toggle this function on and off during a game - Maybe binding it to 'Y' or 'B' on the controller?

Wir steuern ein kleines lustiges Raumschiff (da uns am anfang nur eins zur verf\u00fcgung steht), bewaffnet mit einer art Laserkanone und sch\u00fctzen uns gegen Wellen vor komischen \"Kreis Gegnern\". Ber\u00fchrt man diese, stirbt man und muss von vorne anfangen. Es gibt nat\u00fcrlich nicht nur die genannten \"Kreis Gegner\", es gibt zum beispiel auch Raketen, welche langsame Sch\u00fcsse abfeuern, die dann durch die Map fliegen und dich t\u00f6ten, solltest du in eines der Sch\u00fcsse fliegen, da muss man ganz sch\u00f6n aufpassen.\n\n\nIm laufe des Spieles hat man die m\u00f6glichkeit Pickups zu finden, welche einem eine bessere Kanone verleihen oder einem eine bessere selbstverteidigung geben bis hin zum \"Munitionsaufsauger\", da man nur begrenzte Munition zur verf\u00fcgung hat. Keine sorge, es fliegen gen\u00fcgend Munitionspickups durch die gegend, auch wenn ihr Gegner t\u00f6tet, erhaltet ihr welche. \n\n\nHaben wir M\u00fcnzen gesammelt, k\u00f6nnen wir diese gegen neue Raumschiffe, welche schneller sind und/oder mehr aushalten eintauschen, was einem definitiv einen Motivationsschub sowie gute Abwechslung bietet..\n\n\nU N D ____  D A S ____  A L L E S ____   F \u00dc R ____  NICHT ____ MAL ____ E I N E N ____   E U R O ! ! \n\n\nIch habe Bit Blaster XL gerade mal 30 Minuten gespielt und muss sagen: Top.\n\n\nIch hoffe ich konnte euch dazu bewegen euch dieses tolle Spiel, welches definitiv der perfekte Killer gegen langeweile ist, zu kaufen. ;d Viel Spa\u00df und danke f\u00fcrs lesen meiner Review!\n\n\nDatsik", "timestamp_created": 1464810048, "timestamp_updated": 1464810674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23332677": {"recommendationid": "23332677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011561831", "num_games_owned": 369, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465203432}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0410\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u0432 8-\u0431\u0438\u0442\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0435. \u0414\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0436\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0433\u043e.", "timestamp_created": 1464809997, "timestamp_updated": 1464809997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23332181": {"recommendationid": "23332181", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170435229", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481686053}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy entretenido.

Es un reto tener que aguantar por m\u00e1s tiempo sin chocar o ser disparado.\n\nSon 8 tipos de naves, cada uno tiene m\u00e1s velocidad y defensa. Al principio tendr\u00e1s \u00fanica nave, al disparar los objetos que flotan en el espacio cerrado, te dan suministro de energ\u00eda de l\u00e1ser y cuando aparecen misiles y naves enemigas, es importante evitar ser disparado o ser chocado si no entonces fin de juego. Para adquirir las siguientes naves con mejoras, deber\u00e1s acumular dinero.\n\nAdem\u00e1s incluye los Power Up, existen distintos tipos de armas y mis favoritos son la S de color celeste y E de color azul, ambas armas son efectivas para mi. Cabe destacar que si quieres que dichos Power Up sean duraderos, dispara unos cuantos y acumular suministros y as\u00ed mantienes.\n\n[h1] GR\u00c1FICA - 10/10[/h1]\nLo bueno es que el dise\u00f1o es original y tiene buenos sprites y bien cuidado el aspecto retro con lo moderno.\n\n[h1] M\u00daSICA - 10/10[/h1]\nA decir verdad me gusta mucho su OST, sin duda es muy ameno.\n\n[h1] OPINI\u00d3N SOBRE EL VIDEOJUEGO\t[/h1]\nDiria que es una gran compra para los jugadores que quieren para pasar el rato de disparar naves y objetos.

Where do I even start?\n\n     Bit Blaster XL is a modern take on some of the old retro-sytle arcade games you played back in the 80s(yes i'm not from the 80s. mind you. I was born 2001) there is 8 ships, and each has its' own custom speed,fire rate, shield durability, and song! with each ship it is a little different than the last considering you only have a max of 100 ammo, but there is an option for manual shooting if you want more of a challenge.\n\n       Not to mention since each ship is different you have to adapt to all of them. they each have a different play style. it's kinda like you just got a new game and need to learn how it works. The game has great graphics, and even if you have a $200 laptop that's OK! this game barely needs much at all. there is around a dozen or more powerups and each is different. once you run out of ammo with a powerup then you have to collect more ammo, but you lose the powerup, but don't worry. you can pick up ammo with the powerup: just be careful! don't run into the walls! there is a bit of variety when it comes to enemies. the higher your score: the stronger then enemies(and the more too! might I add).\n\n        You unlock ships by using coins which randomly drop from enemies and some enemies only drop coins. What to talk about next? Ah Yes! The songs are also great! they have a real 8-Bit feel to them(Props and kudos to Spiff Tune. he did an amazing job on the songs. if you're reading this; good job man!). there is such a variety with this game and no two games will be the same! all the things fit really well together and it really feels like an 80s game!\n\n          And that should just about wrap things up here! I hope this review helped and if there is anything I should add please let me know! other than that I want to thank the dev for being active and really listening to what we have to say! I can only imagine how hard it is to be a single dev, but hey! no one can argue with you! Good job Nickervision!

I just wanted to let you know that today I have released a new game on Steam called [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/615610] [b]\u2019orbt xl\u2019[/b] [/url].\n\nIt\u2019s a small game like Bit Blaster XL and is a simple one button arcade game where the goal is to stay in orbit while avoiding obstacles.

I just wanted to let you know that today I have released a new game on Steam called [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/615610] [b]\u2019orbt xl\u2019[/b] [/url].\n\nIt\u2019s a small game like Bit Blaster XL and is a simple one button arcade game where the goal is to stay in orbit while avoiding obstacles. It\u2019s perfect to play when you just have a couple minutes for a few rounds. Due to its similarities to BBXL, I think you might enjoy it as well. It\u2019s available for 15% off for the first week and is very affordable like BBXL. If you do play [b]orbt xl[/b] and have some fun with it, please make sure to leave a brief Steam review.

You collect coins and can buy new ships that move faster, have more shields, or fire faster. They vary enough that you can find the one you are most comfortable using. However, most of the time you will just end up using Ship 7 or 8 as they have the most shield, fire the quickest, and move the fastest.\n\nThere are also weapon pickups that change the way you fire. Some cause explosions, some give you a shotgun style blast, some make you fire incredibly fast. The amount of pickups does become a bit redundant as there are two pickups that are really overpowered and make the others pointless.  You will end up only using about 3 different pickups.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with this game is the controls. Using a controller still made it hard to be accurate at points and the keyboard was even worse. The ships move way to quick at points and make it hard to be precise. I\u2019m not sure if it was just me but this ended up infuriating me at points. Another problem is how slow the score rises. If you go for every achievement, getting to 75k can take a while. You just don\u2019t get enough points. This is quite disheartening when you think you are doing really well and you have destroyed a load of enemies to find out that you only have 15k points.  \n\nI honestly didn\u2019t really enjoy my time playing this game for the reasons that i gave above, however i know that some people will enjoy this game.  It is quite fun if you played it to kill 10 minutes every now and then, but as someone who played this for a 5 hour sitting one time, it might start to bug the hell out of you, If you think this looks fun, go for it.

That's something I've never ever experienced before, so props to him.\n\nAs for the game its a pretty simple score attack asteroids clone with some interesting powerups, a little variation in enemies, a few different ships, and some pretty jammin music.\n\nThe game is fun to play as a casual arcade game, and for $1 you can't beat the value, so I'd recommend it. However there are a few areas where I think this game falls short / could be improved. \n\n-Overall the game feels very slow. I\u2019m sure some users like this / are used to this and so I do not necessarily think it has to be changed for the main game mode, but I personally like fast paced games, and I would like a \"Hard Mode\" or \"Super Speed\" mode where everything is faster, your ship, the enemies and how fast the enemies appear on screen. Also I think the biggest difficulty is how cramped the screen gets when it fills up with enemies, for this new mode it would be cool to see the screen expanded so you had more movement space.\n\n-There is not too much diversity in what you are shooting at, I have not gotten too far so there may be more enemies later, but the game is hard enough that you will spend most of your time shooting at circles and the occasional ship before dying and starting over. Since I'm going to be spending most of my time in the first part of the game it should be engaging.\n\n-The powerups still feel a little lacking to me, some suggestions I have for new ones are: lightning, plasma beam, multiple guided missiles, sin wave ray? My favorite powerups are the lightsaber and the one that shoots energy bombs, because they feel unique, the rest are just slight variations on the starting gun.\n\n-With powerups I would also like to see some kind of tier or upgrade system. players want to be able to upgrade their weapons and hopefully be overpowered, this could be implemented in another mode perhaps where along with ammo dead enemies also drop another type of pickup that upgrades your current weapon if you pick up enough. Also I think primary and secondary upgrades should be separate, you should be able to have the shield or magnet with another weapon.\n\n-The coin system feels lacking, I would rather pick up 20 coins per run and need 500 to get the next ship than maybe pick up 1 coin and only need 10. If i play a round and get no coins, it feels unsatisfying, also different tiers of coins would be fun, red, blue green, and different values for each\n\n-The main upgrade system could also be reworked, buying new ships is nice, and I know you cant have too much change due to the leaderboards, but as a player I would like to be able to permanently upgrade my ship or have some external options to use my coins and feel like I have a sense of progression.\n\nIn closing: More enemy variation, crazier powerups, more upgrades, and a sense of progression would all be additions that would make what is already a good game into something with more replayability and addictiveness.", "timestamp_created": 1461727781, "timestamp_updated": 1467525144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508197", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22653001": {"recommendationid": "22653001", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177764046", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514130094}, "language": "english", "review": "Welp, my mind has changed; I now realize it was a bit early to be writing a review.\n\nI have now also realized the awesome nature of large battles with dozens of enemies all firing at you through which you must skillfully dodge each shot! I've been hooked with trying to pass my high score... but I've been even more hooked by trying to collect enough coins to unlock the next ship. The amount of diversity between its different weapons while somehow being able to maintain balance between them all is amazing - each weapon does something totally different, yet  none are distictly better than some other weapon. Overall it's great for whether I want to sit down for an hour or if I have just a few minutes of free time to kill. Totally worth it for one dollar and no ads or microtransactions!\n\nMy only complaint is the bouncing weapon. Its projectiles bounce, but not in a realistic fashion- they just bounce back the same direction in which they came.

So here it goes!\n\nI would definitely recommend this game! It seems simple enough, but it is incredibly addicting and I found it hard to stop playing when I really got into it. I got used to the controls very quickly, and found them to be simple but perfect for the game. I also really enjoyed the unlockable stuff, because it gave me a reason to keep playing rather than just trying to top my old high score. Each ship was different, so I liked how it kept the high scores for each ship separate. The different power ups were also fun, although some of them were clearly better than others. Then again it also depends on how you play so the diversity was great.\n\n[i]Edit:[/i] Oh yeah, and awesome music which made the game even more enjoyable. Made the game even more fun, and I'd personally be willing to download the soundtrack if the creator put it up for a small price :D\n\nOverall an incredibly fun and addicting game with a great price (I honestly would have payed much more for it), and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a little something to mess around with.", "timestamp_created": 1461621399, "timestamp_updated": 1461621530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22634548": {"recommendationid": "22634548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110869576", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488494477}, "language": "english", "review": "Bit Blaster XL is a simple blaster that reminds me of older arcade games, and the soundtrack makes it even better, and the best part is that its only 99 cents!

Classic asteroidy action. Good fun.\n\nNow for the real review.\n\nBit Blaster XL is a retro arcadey Asteroids-esque game. It's an incredibly well executed fast paced bullet hell, with a catchy arcade soundtrack and unlockables. Whats not to like? \nIt takes a while to get used to the controls, simple as they are, so be prepared to smash into the walls a lot. There are a large number of upgrades to choose from, although they could be more accurately described as powerups given they appear at random. That said, without experience it is hard to tell what powerup does what, or even which ones would be useful. The fact that some of the powerup sprites are only differentiated by colour is not helpful, so be prepared also to spend a fair chunk of time swearing because you let the amazing Explosion powerup go for the terrible version of the shotgun powerup (for example).\n\nThe game also swiftly gets incredibly cluttered, although as I said this is a bullet hell game so what were you expecting. For this there are several useful powerups and several not so useful. Heres a list of my top 5 and one I never take, even if it means sticking with the peashooter they give you at the start.\n(Note: These are all my own names, given the lack of andy form of guide)\n\n\n1.) Explosion/Lightsaber (Blue E and Green L respectively) depending on which ship you use. Fast ships go for lightsaber as a swift turn can cut through the bigass splitting asteroids really quickly, netting you a nice chunk of ammo. Otherwise go for the explosion, as it lingers for a bit and any enemies that walk into the field left  blow up too.\n2.) Don't get me wrong, both of the above are incredibly useful on any ship, it's just that faster ships perform better with the lightsaber than slower ones.\n3.) Homing balls (Orange H). This fires (at a cost of 5 ammo) an orange blob at a random enemy on screen, and lets you keep firing the standard gun. Useful, and given that each ammo drop gives you 5 ammo, as  long as you're quick enough this can go on forever.\n4.) Ricochet (sorry can't remember the icon for this one). As the name says. Very useful, especially later, as there is no way they can miss with the number of enemies on screen.\n5.) I agonized for a bit over this one, because there are a couple that are really good. But the last one is Multi (Orange M). This fires a shot to the front and the back. This is especially useful given the turning circle of some of the ships. \n\nThe one you should never, ever, ever go for :-\nMasshole (Purple M). The only boost this has, as far as I can tell, is making the ammo pickups drift towards you slightly quicker. Given that they do this anyway, and that it slows down the speed of your main weapon firing, it's just useless.

The ship they control is constantly moving forward, to dodge enemies and thier bullets the player must turn with the right and left arrow keys as well as can use a boost, or could take the hit with a shield. As players progress in the game they recieve ammo, which allows them to keep firing at enemies to get more and more ammo and the game is infinite. Instead of an ammo drops, RNG gods can grant the player a shiny golden coin! These coins can be used to buy a different ship, some ships are bigger with more shields, smaller with more speed, and is up to the player on how they wish to play the game. Along with that choice, the developer gives more choices to players, as you can actually toggle auto-firing OFF!

I highly recommend to all players that enjoy arcade games, and even if you dont its cheap, enjoyable, and a great game to have in your steam library, get it :)\n\n [quote][i]For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LotsOGiveaways]Lot's O Giveaway's[/url] group curations [url=steamcommunity.com/groups/LotsOGiveaways#curation]here[/url]![/i][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1460054351, "timestamp_updated": 1460054379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533760", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1495321967, "developer_response": "="}, "22287562": {"recommendationid": "22287562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073987397", "num_games_owned": 437, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460479730}, "language": "english", "review": "Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive Addictive", "timestamp_created": 1460048988, "timestamp_updated": 1460048988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529919", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22282414": {"recommendationid": "22282414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042090250", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461066918}, "language": "english", "review": "Bit Blaster XL - Simple but incredibly entertaining, as well as challenging.

If you're using a keyboard, the controls are limited to 3 buttons: you steer your ship with the left and right arrow keys, and use your boost with the spacebar. There's an auto-fire option where the ship continuously shoots, or there's a manual-fire option where you can press ctrl or alt to fire a shot. If you don't want to use a keyboard to play, you can also use a gamepad.\n\nThe gameplay is simple; You shoot the enemies to score points, and each enemy drops a green ammo pickup that slowly moves towards you. It may seem easy, but scoring really high becomes difficult since you can't stop your ship, and some enemies shoot (slow moving) bullets towards you. \n\nMy one and only complaint is that there is no pause button, but on an arcade-styled game like this that's meant to be short and replayed, the lack of a pause function is practically a non-issue unless you're going for a marathon score run. \n[b]Edit:[/b] The developer has added not only a Pause feature to the game, but also a brake feature to slow your ship down as well.\n\nFor what Bit Blaster XL has to offer, I'd say it is definitely worth the price and I strongly recommend it as a great casual game.

It\u2019s perfect to play when you just have a couple minutes for a few rounds. Due to its similarities to BBXL, I think you might enjoy it as well. It\u2019s available for 15% off for the first week and is very affordable like BBXL. If you do play [b]orbt xl[/b] and have some fun with it, please make sure to leave a brief Steam review.

More devs should follow suit.  \n\nThe addition of two game modes supporting both auto fire and non-auto fire is such a simple thing, but it makes a huge difference by giving the player the option.  I found the selective firing method provided a gaming experience that made me feel much more in control of the game rather than before where it was just a monotonous exercise in moving around.  You can time your shots and WAIT for enemies to position based on the type of special powerups you have now.  Originally the simple premise of the game was part of its charm, but also highlighted some flaws.  Putting the timing of movement and firing back in the player's control adds that little strategy that was missing before.  \n\nFor the price, now I would definitely recommend this game.  \n\n\n*Original Review below (Negative)*\n\nI like the concept of the game, but after about 45 minutes, you'll have all the achievements (except the higher score ones) and nothing else to do.  Even something as simple as some score multipliers would keep the game fresh a little longer.  With that said, the thing that needs the most work is the auto-shooting.  \n\nI'm not entirely opposed to the auto-shooting mechanic.  I mean, it's the developers game so it's his/her choice, but one thing that is unsatisfactory about it is the fact that as soon as you press \"start\" to begin a game, there about 5-6 enemies that slowly spawn over about 30 seconds, but your ship is forced to shoot off in the distance for what boils down to probably a 10% accuracy rate simply because there is nothing to shoot.  \n\nNow, no one cares about accuracy, it's not even a stat to track in this game, but I bring it up because of the simple fact that there is no DEFAULT unlimited ammo so when you run out of ammo (because you're forced to shoot into the void remember?), you simply STOP SHOOTING.  That's it.  The game is a SHOOTER!  \n\nWhat should happen is one of two things:  \n\n1.  If you have a special weapon and run out of that type of ammo, your ship should default to regular unlimited bullets. \n2.  If you don't have a special weapon, you should never run out of the default bullets.  (Think Contra for the NES).  \n\nI'll change my review if the default bullet issue is addressed.

They often change the way the game is played in ways both large and small. with some, the best strategy is to be calm and fire conservatively like with the blue explosive power up, while with others, the best strategy is to spray and pray, like with the richocheting pink power up. I quickly found ones that I prefered. My favorite was always the purple one that acted like a short range shot gun. \n\nOf course, minor critisisms became more pronounced the longer I played. It's often very easy to take multiple hits in quick succession for ships with shields due to the lack of invinsibility frames. The scoreboard is pretty meaningless and hard to get to considering this is a game where the only goal is to get a high score. \n\nIn fact, after a while, the game gets pretty samey. Since the score is such an after thought, the only reason to play the game is for the game's own sake. Once every round of bit blasting feels like the last one, it starts to get boring. After the first few ship unlocks, it takes too long to get the next ship for that to be a proper motivation to keep playing.  \n\nStill, for all it's faults, I had a decent ammount of fun with it. For the price of a dollar, I think it's worth a try, especially if it's on sale.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nShip combat is not Bit Blaster's strength. Bullets only eject from the front of the ship, and the ship can only go forward with an incredibly large turning radius. It's clunky. That's not to say that you can't get good at it, it's just not fun to get good at.\n\nWhat is Bit Blaster XL's strength then? well, it has some kick ass music. That alone kept me going for longer than I would normally have.\n\nI think the real strength of Bit Blaster is its power up system. Each power up is completely unique and has the potential to be completely game changing. Sure, there are the mundane ones that just make you fire faster or also shoot from your butt, but there are also the ones that make large balls the same size as your ship bounce off the walls of the screen, filling the entire thing with your bullets, or the ones that make explosives that blow up everything in front of your ship, or the one that gives you a short range laser that makes you have to get up in the business of anythin you want to kill.\n\nThey're pretty sweet, I'll admit.\n\nStill, it's not enough to carry the game for me. The terrible controls really hinder the game, and the space ships that I unlocked before quitting were pretty lack luster. Maybe someone else will find it more fun than I did.", "timestamp_created": 1454613314, "timestamp_updated": 1460342028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506508", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1454701163, "developer_response": "Hey terrahex,  \n\nThanks for playing and taking the time to write a review.\n\nI just wanted to take a moment to address a couple of your concerns. There has been an issue where the speed/balance of the game wasn't correct for some players dependant on their setup. I have been working hard over the last two weeks to try and address these issues. One of those is about the turning radius not working correctly. [url=http://i.imgur.com/y68UqDi.png] [b]Here[/b] [/url]is a picture that shows the proper turning radius. The white circle should be how fast the ship can turn. Please let me know if that is the radius of the turns you saw. As well you can double check with the trailer on the store page to confirm that your gameplay was running the same way. I have pushed a v1.2 update that has made strides to fix these issues, so I would love to know if it resolves it for you if it was a problem. \n\nThanks for the compliments on the powerup system, I really love games with a variety of powerups so I of course wanted to add a bunch to mine, I even added a new one yesterday called Giant Shot.\n\nThe music is actually by a guy called Spiff Tune that makes some royalty free tracks, I asked him If I could use the song in my game and he said yes. His soundcloud can be found [url=https://soundcloud.com/spifftune/sets/creative-commons-tracks] [b]here[/b][/url], he has some great tracks and you should check them out.\n\nAnyways, thanks a lot for playing, I hope if that bug was affecting you, you'll give it another shot and it will address your main concern with the game. I am just happy to hear people have played it and want to make sure that it's not a technical problem that is causing them to not have fun with it.\n\n-Adam\n"}, "20953683": {"recommendationid": "20953683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147938799", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470350719}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun little game", "timestamp_created": 1454609350, "timestamp_updated": 1454609350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494612", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20953325": {"recommendationid": "20953325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078839759", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478885348}, "language": "english", "review": "Hi. \n\nI LOVE spaces hooters. Bit Blaster XL is a mix of Asteroids, Robotron and Berzerk. Camera is over the space room full of enemies. You have a spaceship with limited ammo. The trick is: better weapons needs more ammo. Even without combo point system you had to destroy someting constantly, because every dead enemy drops ammo and you need it to feed a weapon. If you're out of ammo, you're back to a standard pew pew laser.\n\nIt's a very simple, but effective mechanic. It's always risk vs reward, so you can play safe, or beat a crap out of hi-score. Game is really hard, because most weapons shoots only in the direction that you are flying (like in Berzerk), but enemies of course are all over you and can aim. So it is a challenge, like any other arcade style shooter, but not unfair and I feel I can handle it.\n\nHave fun.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT: Last upgrade is really nice.

I just wanted to let you know that today I have released a new game on Steam called [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/615610] [b]\u2019orbt xl\u2019[/b] [/url].\n\nIt\u2019s a small game like Bit Blaster XL and is a simple one button arcade game where the goal is to stay in orbit while avoiding obstacles.

It is similar to several differnent classic arcade games that I have played, and I am a sucker for retro games. I have been really enjoying the game, and have even been catching myself trying again and again just trying to better my high score and place higher on the leaderboards.\n\n\nControls are simple. Your little ship moves automatically, with you being able to control its turning, as well as having control over a boost that depletes and recharges over time. Your ship fires automatically as well, and there are many different power-ups that spawn on the screen that you can pick up that will change your weapon. You weapon uses ammo which can be reloaded by shooting enemies and picking up their little green balls. All is simple, even death. There are no lives and if you get shot without your sheilds, you're done for! \n\n\nThe game also has a little currency system where enemies may occasionally drop gold coins, which you can use to purchase new ships!\n\n\nIn my opinion, This game is super well made, and as of the 1.1 version, all of the bugs below have been FIXED from what I have been able to witness. The developer gets an A+ for responding to reviews and fixing these bugs in a timely manner. Kudos to you Dev. :)\n\n+ (FIXED) While using a controller, a \"ghost\" of myself would spawn with me and remain motionless while i fly around. If the ghost took damage, it would end the game for me.\n+ (FIXED) The \"H\" power-up (Homing projectile) could be picked up but not fire a single homing shot. Only the basic weapon would remain active.\n+ (FIXED) Enemy's red projectiles would sometimes do much more damage then they should, taking down multiple layers of your sheild instead of just one layer. I could be wrong in which some projectiles are meant to deal more damage, but I haven't seen any consistencies in damage output by certain enemies. (Bug perhaps? Would be nice to get some feedback from the devs on this.)\n\n\nMain thing I would like to see in a future update would be more products in the shop. There is a total of only seven ships in the game, and when you buy them, there is nothing left to buy and gold then becomes obsolete, unless you want to collect lots of gold, like me! I would love to see additions to the shop to spend my gold on. (i.e. More ships, power-ups to unlock, ship appearences, rocket trails, enemy appearences, etc.)\n\n\nThis game has huge potential to become something even better than it already is. The Developer is super positive and proactive on fixing bugs, and I cannot wait to see what else could be in store for the future. I definitely would recommend this game to anyone who loves simple, casual, challenging indie games.

What can i say. Cheap budget title that is actually a good game. \n\nShortly it's a very old game idea brought to a more modern day setting yet retaining the simplicity of how things worked before. Those of you who have played your Omega Races, Blasteroids etc a long time ago when men were steel and computers were made of wood feel right at home. Gameplay couldn't be more simpler and difficulty curve keeps slowly going up. Highscore is what you are aiming for. Everything else is just fluff. \n\nAnd when you die it's all your own fault so keep on practicing. \n\nControls work nicely. nothing to complain (played on gamepad). \n\nMusic is ok. though the one simple tune will soon need to muted. Generally the music could have been more...hmm... meatier? But i suppose thats just the old man being nostalgic.

Despite the fact that it is a theme that has been done to death, this is surprisingly a lot of fun to play and has proven to be incredibly addictive. \n\nYour ammunition rapidly depletes as a result of your ship constantly auto-firing forcing you to collect the ammo power-ups throughout all of the hazards on screen, which becomes very challenging after a certain point in time. Collectables include coins to unlock other ships in your arsenal and different temporary weapons, ranging from rapid fire, bouncing projectiles, explosives and even a light saber esque weapon, plus many more.\n\nAs your points increase, so does the difficulty, things become very hectic after the 10,000 point margin always keeping you on your toes. One word of advice though, if you're going to play this, I would highly recommend using a controller, it's tough to maneuver using a keypad. \n\nI couldn't recommend this game highly enough, especially since it's incredibly cheap.

How can you go wrong. The game has great pixel graphics, you could run this on your mothers toaster. The gameplay is very simple, you could teach this game to a person whos never played a game in their life. You turn left and right, and you press a button to boost. Thats it. As you go objects fly past you and and green pickups that refill your ammo as you are constantly shooting. There are also powerup weapons that come along and change your shot type, this offers variety to the game and you arent stuck with the same straight line shot every run. The longer you stay alive shooting objects and ships the more harder it gets, spawn rates increase, harder enemies come along and the whole screen is basically flooded with stuff to dodge and manouver. When you die you can return to the ship selection where you can unlock new \"bit blasters\" with the yellow coins you collect in runs. Each ship has different stats but as you progress that ships become slightly better every time. Another thing i like about this game is when you die you can just hit one button and youre back in the game again, no uneccesary screens to go through, however it takes a while for the difficulty to ramp up back to where the game is actually fun.

Bit Blasters roots are definitely a mobile game. I made Bit Blaster for Android / iOS in december. My thoughts originally for the game were \"How can I make a shooting game like luftrausers / geometry wars, but make it accessible on mobile?\" That's how I came up with the autofire / automove. Then the player only needed to control turning and smartly go for powerups / ammo. Eventually I released it and people were loving it, so I started making it for Android TV and Apple TV, and once it was on the big screen and I was passing around the controller with my nephews, I realized with some graphical tweaks and speed changes, as well as a boost. This could be a lot of fun for the Steam audience. That's why I priced it so low, I didn't want people to think they were getting screwed with a short experience, I wanted to let people to pay around a buck for a fun, replayable arcade experience that I could keep adding little things to.\n\nEither way, not sure why I told you my life story.Thanks for leaving feedback, I hope you'll reconsider your recommendation based on the price/performance of the title at hand.

Also I LOVE the cool power ups for your ship and how there sre so many of them  my personal favourite is the one that makes a beam come out of your ship.

The simple controls make for a fun, frantic, bit-sized adventure that keeps you saying \"just one more game.\" In the way of complaints, my only one is that it definitely feels like a mobile game, in that the controls seem suited more for a touch screen than a controller, and the monetary system seems directly ripped from Sonic Dash and the like.

You like unlocking stuff.\n\nI'd already bought this game from the moment I saw the gameplay style and graphics in the trailer way before I even placed it into my Cart. \n\nYou can select to fire manually or have the ship shoot automatically, forever. \"(+)\" coins are your ammo and, depending on which ship you're currently flying and which mode you're in, you'll want to grab every last one of these suckers. Don't worry about them too much though as they will all gravitate inwards towards you. \n\nAlso be on the lookout for gold coins, you'll want to collect these to unlock additional ships. Collect more coins by taking out special golden enemies. Each ship has different Speed, Attack, and Shield stats to make things more interesting. Be a speedy glass cannon or a slow but powerful bruiser. In Automatic Mode, a ship's attack level is directly tied to how fast it will eat through ammo stores.\n\nPower-ups, power-ups, power-ups! Homing missles, area bombs, spread guns, laser beams, bouncing plasma balls, and rapid-fire cannons just to name a few.

Or gamepad, for that matter. Mostly, gamepad. This game is more enjoyable with one of those... If you have one. If you haven't, it's no biggie, you can play it with keyboard. Now that I think about it, this should've been point 4... Gamepad. But I am no Gaben and I like number 3.\n[/list]\n\nSo, yeah... Anyway. It's a good casual game and I do recommend it to everyone who is into classics and pseudo-retro pixel-like games. Or casual games... Or just games. Or into really cheap games... Yeah.

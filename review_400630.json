The cheerful music combining with bountiful colors instantly arise the Dopamine chemicals in your brain.\nThen you start playing it, immediately you're hooked like a wide mouth bass. It seems nothing else in the world madders so you just keep playing, and playing. Eventually, night over takes the sky, and you're body is telling you to sleep. No. Just one more hour.\n                  An hour passes. No just, one more... hour. Next thing you know its 3 a.m. \nJ-just... more... o-one... BANG, your physical will cease's to comply. Head on keyboard and thumb in your mouth, sleeping like a baby. \n                  But wait, your joy of playing Wuppo has not ended. For you dream of it in your sleep! Sleep had never been so much fun before. \n\n                  *Yawn* You wake up and stretch with a smile on your face. Then you look down at the slobbery keyboard. Oh yeah! I was playing Wuppo! Man, I love life. Thus continues the addiction further more.\n\nK, but seriously this game is awesome. This game strongly reminds me of the first Yoshi's Island, and The Paper Mario Series, just because of the humour and color + art style. It also warms my heart to find little details such as when you start in your room, there's a pizza box that you can jump in, then if you jump out you kick some food out with you. \n                  I also like this game because it dosen't strive to be a popular game, it is what it is.

Beyond worth it's price. Wuppo is really cute, fun and imaginative but also boasts varying difficulty for those who want more challenge. I absolutely adored all of the characters and the world on whole, I'd certainly kill for Wuppo2 or something similar! It's rather story based, there's a lot of talking to characters and solving their issues but this is the first game in a while that hasn't bored me with too much talk - I was really interested in what was going on in the world of Wuppo and it's adorable little inhabitants. Usually I don't care to learn more when playing games, but I wanted to do everything and see everything I could find in this one!

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/gaming_until_end]Gaming Until End[/url], through the generous contribution of [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/HellCowON]HellCow.[/url] [/quote]\n\n[h1][b]Wuppo[/b][/h1]\n\n[b]Wuppo[/b] is a 2D adventure game. You play as a wum (a type of furball race) who goes by the name Scallywag. Thing is, Scallywag loves ice cream. This little wum lives at a place called Wumhouse. But is later kicked for spilling ice cream and giving Carlos a hard time. Now, this is where the journey begins. Scallywag must get back to the Wumhouse somehow and then look for another place to live since Carlos does not want him to stay there anymore. A great game for people of all ages.\n\n[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]\n\nThe game requires patience. Everything needs to be perfectly timed for you to even proceed to another level. Fortunately, there is also difficulty options for you to choose while playing. The game runs smooth without any lags or stuttering. One thing is, while high graphics is set, even though I see no lags or stutters, while moving from one area to another, The game slows down a little. Only for a short period of time though. There are over 3+ save slots and you can also choose to play on more than one save game for 1 user. That's even better if you have any siblings or friends who want to play this game and you don't even have to let them play your save file.\n\n[h1][b]Graphics[/b][/h1]\n\nThe game looks very bright and colorful. The graphics are great and the Wums look cuter than ever. For low graphics, the game is more pixelated but still enjoyable. With high graphics set up, the game looks wonderful. I love how they have made every little details as clear as possible. The colors are bright and not very dull. Overall, this looks great without anything to pull it down the list.\n\n[h1][b]Bugs and glitches[/b][/h1]\n\nHere's something that really annoyed me; When I was randomly selecting stuffs I had while scrolling through near the stone pillar, I accidentally pressed on the place marker which is there to place things on the pillar. That's pretty normal but the thing is, I had nothing selected so what was placed on the pillar, was nothing and yet, the pillar did go down. That wouldn't be a problem if the pillar went down or not, but what's a problem is, you need to put appropriate items on each of the 4 pillars. So the bugged pillar prevented me from proceeding with my game. I tried loading my last saved games but sadly, the pillar was still down since I saved the game after placing \"Nothing\" on the pillar. \n\n[h1][b]Content[/b][/h1]\nThis is not one of those 2 or 3 hour games that you think you can finish easily. It takes time to complete each task. You earn in-game currency and you have to spend it on things to complete said missions. It will definitely take time because even I have only gotten to 20% completed progress for 2hrs of gameplay.\n\n[h1][b]Total average and final notes[/b][/h1]\n[h1][i]I had lots of fun playing this game and haven't had any major problems with it. I'm gonna give this game a score of [u]7/10.[/u] You guys should really give this game a try.

As mais de 90 m\u00fasicas v\u00eam apenas para refor\u00e7ar a influ\u00eancia [i]nintendista[/i] \u2013 N\u00e3o por soarem iguais, mas pelo claro poder de absorver o(a) jogador(a) para dentro do jogo. \u00c9 dif\u00edcil incomodar-se com a composi\u00e7\u00e3o, cada nova \u00e1rea passa a ter uma atmosfera \u00fanica devido \u00e0 melodia, cada m\u00fasica uma nova sensa\u00e7\u00e3o\u2026 Simplesmente um trabalho sensacional para uma pessoa s\u00f3 (men\u00e7\u00e3o honrosa para as m\u00fasicas \u201cMiniboss\u201d, \u201cBlafknoft\u201d e \u201cWumhouse Night\u201d).\n\tCom todo este poder que sua m\u00fasica transparece, facilmente nos vemos embalados por uma hist\u00f3ria leve e despreocupada. Em Wuppo, voc\u00ea assume o papel de um Wum pregui\u00e7oso e desastrado, o qual \u00e9 expulso do hotel que reside por derramar muito sorvete pelos corredores, sendo agora obrigado a vagar pelo mundo a procura de um novo lar. Como pode ver, a hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 simples, mas o jogo compensa o enredo fraco com humor e personagens caricatos. Cheguei, at\u00e9 mesmo, a rir sozinho com piadas inesperadas. Acredito que justamente pela demora de sete anos para o t\u00e9rmino do jogo (desenvolvido paralelamente \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o acad\u00eamica da dupla holandesa), Knuist & Perzik tiveram tempo para criar di\u00e1logos ic\u00f4nicos e c\u00f4micos. Houve, inclusive, para minha surpresa, conversas que chegaram a comover-me. Todavia, advirto que o jogo n\u00e3o chega a impressionar com sua hist\u00f3ria ou mesmo marcar o(a) jogador(a) com analogias intrincadas. Wuppo \u00e9 isto: Um divertido jogo para desligar-se por algumas horas, assim como grande parte dos jogos de 90\u2019.\n\tContudo, n\u00e3o engane-se pela apar\u00eancia inofensiva. Dependendo da dificuldade escolhida, Wuppo pode ser um jogo extremamente desafiador. Apesar de um in\u00edcio pacato e bobo, Wuppo \u00e9 recheado de batalhas contra diversos bosses, sendo que sua maioria possui um padr\u00e3o criativo, for\u00e7ando o(a) jogador(a) a testar e experimentar at\u00e9 descobrir a fraqueza de seu inimigo. Claro, h\u00e1 suas exce\u00e7\u00f5es ao longo da lista de 18 bosses, alguns sendo f\u00e1cil demais e outros um tanto exagerados, mas nada realmente imposs\u00edvel. Al\u00e9m do mais, caso n\u00e3o consiga derrotar algum boss em espec\u00edfico, voc\u00ea pode seguir sua explora\u00e7\u00e3o e procurar reunir itens de cura ou aumentar a sua capacidade de HP para tentar novamente mais tarde. Mas advirto-o(a) desde j\u00e1: N\u00e3o gaste seu tempo procurando por novas armas. Apesar de o jogo passar a ideia de que haver\u00e1 um certo arsenal a sua disposi\u00e7\u00e3o, Wuppo limita-se a 3 armas, e voc\u00ea geralmente se usar\u00e1 apenas uma delas. Este seria um defeito f\u00e1cil de relevar, afinal, as batalhas n\u00e3o dependem tanto das armas, mas sim da habilidade do(a) jogador(a). Contudo, Knuist & Perzik perderam um grande ponto em meu conceito por ter disponibilizado, pouco ap\u00f3s o lan\u00e7amento do jogo, um DLC que adiciona alguns recursos extras, entre eles, uma nova arma. O DLC n\u00e3o \u00e9 caro mas, sem sombra de d\u00favida, o jogo teria se beneficiado muito mais com esta pequena mudan\u00e7a se esta tivesse sido implementada ao jogo base, e os desenvolvedores se beneficiariam ainda mais por n\u00e3o terem seus nomes escritos no Death Note dos DLCs.\n\tUma pena mesmo.\n\tMas apesar deste [i]pequeno deslize[/i], Wuppo ainda merece a aten\u00e7\u00e3o dos agraciadores de jogos indie. Afinal de contas, o universo de Wuppo n\u00e3o \u00e9 apenas divertido, mas a todo momento voc\u00ea sente que trata-se de um universo [b]vivo[/b]. Feito em Game Maker, a fluidez do jogo em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao seu game design \u00e9 fascinante, e toda a ideia de que o mundo est\u00e1 em constante movimento concretiza-se. Isto pode ter soado um tanto abstrato, mas em um exemplo mais pr\u00e1tico: Para viajar para uma das cidades do jogo, voc\u00ea deve tomar um trem, o qual parte de cinco em cinco minutos (aproximadamente). Caso voc\u00ea o perca, dever\u00e1 aguardar pacientemente a chegada do pr\u00f3ximo ve\u00edculo. Agora, ao embarc\u00e1-lo, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 fast travel, voc\u00ea dever\u00e1 acomodar-se e aguardar a viagem concluir-se, podendo aproveitar de uma r\u00e1pida pausa em um famoso caf\u00e9. Ao chegar na cidade, novamente, voc\u00ea deve justificar sua entrada na cidade passando por uma r\u00e1pida fila (e n\u00e3o ser\u00e1 atendido se tentar fur\u00e1-la). E estas a\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o desencadeiam ao que o(a) jogador(a) adentra a \u00e1rea \u2013 Trata-se de um processo constante. A sensa\u00e7\u00e3o de que toda aquela sociedade funciona sem a sua influ\u00eancia logo fica em evid\u00eancia, e os NPCs ganham uma autonomia a mais, ganham um brilho diferenciado. Claro, quando tive que pegar o trem pela sexta vez (por ter esquecido algo na superf\u00edcie), admito que comecei a ficar levemente irritado. O primeiro pensamento que me passou pela cabe\u00e7a foi: \u201cComo \u00e9 chato depender disto para viajar\u201d, mas ap\u00f3s analisar minha frustra\u00e7\u00e3o, percebi que viajar em um jogo nunca foi algo t\u00e3o real.\n\tSim, masoquista de minha parte ter gostado disto, por\u00e9m, foi com ideias inusitadas e criativas como esta que Wuppo chamou a minha aten\u00e7\u00e3o. Trata-se de um jogo que vai al\u00e9m de sua premissa para poder apresentar novos conceitos. Hora consegue, hora falha, mas nunca deixa de tentar. E \u00e9 neste compasso de descoberta que Knuist & Perzik transformaram um jogo simples em uma divertida experi\u00eancia. Agora resta-me apenas torcer que n\u00e3o percam o seu caminho e continuem a produzir jogos t\u00e3o \u00fanicos como este, afastando-se sempre do mal caminho que s\u00e3o os DLCs.\n\n\n[h1][b]TL;DR:[/b][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Arte: 7.5/10\n[*]M\u00fasica: 10/10\n[*]Jogabilidade: 8/10\n[*]Hist\u00f3ria: 7/10\n[*]Originalidade: 9/10\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Overall: 8.3/10[/h1]\n\n\tWuppo \u00e9 um jogo que certamente merece ser apreciado por qualquer amante de jogos indie.

Por mais que sua arte possa decepcionar em determinados momentos, Wuppo promete uma aventura repleta de humor em um exc\u00eantrico e agrad\u00e1vel mundo. O jogo testar\u00e1 a habilidade daqueles que assim procurarem, mas s\u00e3o aqueles que buscam por um jogo mais criativo que aproveitar\u00e3o o seu verdadeiro potencial.\n\n[i]P.S. \u2013 Ao jogar, prepare-se para nomes e termos demasiadamente esquisitos.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1512687186, "timestamp_updated": 1512687186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38123070": {"recommendationid": "38123070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025137607", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512499971}, "language": "english", "review": "I\u2019d like to make this review short: Wuppo is a funny, original game full of weird and lovable characters, one of the most interesting adventures I\u2019ve ever played.\n\nIf you ever loved games by Love-De-Lic (Moon, UFO: a day in the life, Lack of Love), Skip (Chibi-Robo, Giftpia, Captain Rainbow), Punchline (Chulip) and Vanpool (Endonesia, Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland), you will probably also love Wuppo.

It reminds me a lot of Simon's Quest and other super cryptic games. The difference is this game brings a certain charm that makes you want to try to solve the mystery of what the hell is going on. Why did you click on this game? Why are you considering buying it? Why are you reading my review? Because this game's uniqueness is enough to make you want to dive in. It happened to me one college debate trip as me and my best friend were strolling the steam store to kill time. \"Da fuq is that?\" I asked...and thus....an adventure was born.\n\n[u]the Charm[/u]\nTo detail out what charm I'm refering to, I'll create a list of the things this game does well in the unique department.\n\n[b]-Wums[/b]\nThese are the main race of the game. You play as one and are surrounded by tons of them. I think the wum looks like a mound of bird poop, my friend who discovered this with me called them potato balls and my girlfriend calls them marshmellows. What exactly is he? He is....a wum....like the game doesn't compare them to anything we know but rather invents something new. It'd be like trying to describe a human to an alien who comes from a world where humans are not present. Like imagine if an alien race didn't sit in chairs, they didnt have a need to sit. Trying to explain why a human sits might be rather difficult. Wums are...beings that kinda just...mill about doing stuff....while shooting gum out of a gun at enemies...yeah it's kinda hard to explain these characters.\n\n[b]-Lore[/b]\nI'm not ganna lie, I'm not a big story person. I do not like games that have a huge focus on story, where you end up watching/reading more than actually playing. However, there is some games that have amazing lore that is told in ways that keep me captivated. A few examples is Doom 3 with the use of PDA Audio Logs to immerse the player in the world of the UAC, Dark Souls with mysterious characters and item descriptions that give hints to what's happening, or lastly Bethesda games that rewards exploration with explainations of what is happening. Wuppo follows this scheme by borrowing from all of these elements. You explore, you find film strips which are like Doom 3's audio logs, meet strange unqiue potato balls and discover that the lore is as deep as the pacific ocean. The developers invented an entire ecosystem, civilization and history.\n\n[b]-Soundtrack[/b]\n9 times out of 10 I turn off game music. It takes a lot for me to leave the music on, the soundtrack has to be something magnificent for me to leave it on. Doom 1993, Starbound, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Saints Row, Grand Theft Auto are examples of games where I leave the music on. Wuppo's soundtrack is expansive, it has a lot of tracks, and they are all really catchy. I end up singing some of the songs that get stuck in my head. Just in case you thought there was lyrics to these songs, by singing I mean going \"boop boop booooooooooo looooo dooo choooo\". The music reminds me of retro titles on Nintendo or Sega consoles. \n\n[u]the Meh[/u]\nIf I'm going to mention the charms, I better point out the so-so elements to the game.\n\n[b]-Gameplay[/b]\nI dunno, platformers are so...bleh for me. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is one of my favorite games of all time but almost purely for nostalgic reasons. This is kinda how platformers are for me as a 21 year old, memories of a time when I used to like platformers. In Wuppo you do some hardcore parkour to get to places you need to go. Considering that some areas have no parallax and the screen just changes, it makes it hard to get from point A to point B. In Sonic you run left to right and the screen scrolls, this is parallax. In Fallout 3/NV/4 when you enter a door it has a temporary load screen then you pop out on the other side, this is screen change. Now pretend the screen change is instant without a load time, I am having a hard time coming up with an example in another game, because the screen doesn't scroll it leaves you disoriented and wondering where you are on said screen. This is Wuppo in some areas. Sometimes there is parallax, sometimes there isn't. Last part of the gameplay is combat. You shoot at gun at enemies, it does a certain amount of damage, you got to evade the enemies to survive and you can use health items to keep yourself alive....nothing special. It's not bad, just meh.\n\n[b]-Story[/b]\n\"But MoonKat, you just said the lore is part of the charm!\" Here is where you need to know the difference between story and lore. When I say lore I refer to the world, when I say story I refer to your character's storyline. Audio logs in Doom 3? Lore. Cut Scenes where your character is spying on a conversation? Story. Wuppo's story is boring. Without spoiling anything it's basically a Wum learning to not be a giant douche.......meh.\n\n[u]the Crap[/u]\nWuppo is not Game of the Year, it has some glaring issues that keep me from considering it a perfect experience.\n\n[b]-Lack of Explainations[/b]\nWhat hat does what? Am I supposed to kill this thing? What's my objective exactly? What's the advantage of being fat versus not being fat? How do I sneak? Oh...I can go in some boxes but not others? Why do I need to whistle? There is so many more questions I could bring up but it would spoil some story elements. I am not complaining about challenge, I don't need a minimap or hand holding tutorials, but actually knowing what items do would be helpful. Some of the solutions to puzzles are almost impossible to solve by yourself. A spoiler-free-example is when a fisherman needs a hook, where do you get the hook? A store right? Of course! But wait, there is a bunch of hooks...which hook does he need? I bought the hook and he fished out an item that I need for what exactly? Some of the cryptic moments are fun, but majority of the time leave me with a guide open.\n\n[b]Performance[/b]\nI have a Nvidia 1070 Graphics card with a current gen processor and this game still stutters from time to time on max graphic settings.....why? It's hand drawn! \n\n[b]Only able to use 1 item at a time[/b]\nInstead of typing out a long explaination I'm just going to give you an instance of where this drives me mad. You can only equip 1 item at one time. A candle is used for light and sits on your head. If equipped, you can't use your gun. There is some enemies in pitch black areas......bull$%!#....I hate that mechanic.\n\nIn the end...Wuppo is a game you should definately pick up for 5 bucks when it's on sale. You'll get a lot of amazing experiences out of this game. It's not perfect, but isn't bad, it's actually pretty good. If you want me to cover more areas of the game, let me know and I will update the review. I left some space for any further information that you might request. \n\nTL;DR\nA cryptic platformer with meh gameplay but amazing charm that leaves you with intense curiosity. You will want answers, you will want to explore the unique world to find those answers. I give it a hard recommend as long as you go in with the expectation of playing a flawed diamond in the rough.", "timestamp_created": 1511882914, "timestamp_updated": 1511882914, "voted_up": true,

Got it in a bundle. Didn't expect anything, didn't know about it. What I ended up with, was one of the best games I've ever played in certain categories.\n\nWuppo offers an immersive single-player exploration \"platformer\" built over the course of 7 years.  Where your actions seem to matter, and the world feels alive.  I voted Wuppo for the \"Suspension of Disbelief\" Steam award, because despite the wild setting, I was totally drawn in.  Wanted to know more, see more of this world.  ... (It ended too soon!)\n\nThere's just a wealth of detail and interestingly executed ideas that you won't find in even the best games that sets this game apart.  Details rarely found in a 2D format.  And this is where the game succeeds the most imo. (Also fun for a wide range of ages I imagine.)\n\nIt also features some memorable use of music, the occasional but interesting battle, and plenty of secrets to uncover.  It's just a really good example of an indie game.  A two person crew spend 7 years creating a game, no kickstarter/crowdfunding.  And they made something special.\n\nWhat can I say, but think about it!  It's currently 70% off and less than Undertale's soundtrack on sale.  I call that a good deal.\n\nIf you want some cons...? \nSuprisingly I prefer mouse and keyboard for this game.\nI admit I got stuck near the start by behaving unexpectedly.  Some things are not spoonfed, and I didn't realize I should shoot a certain object.\nSingle save spot per game.\nAlso, battles can be far and few, but unexpectedly difficult on normal near the end.  \nI wish the game was bigger...  Even though I got 30 hours out of it by exploring every corner without even restarting the game.  \nOh and some achievements are tough without a guide.\n\nPS - The only game that I would directly compare it to, would be the free game: Strawberry Jam, made by Daniel Remar (creator of games like Iji, Hyper Princess Pitch, Hero Core; part of Ludosity which created games like Ittle Dew, Princess Remedy), minus the battles.", "timestamp_created": 1511504439, "timestamp_updated": 1511504439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665246", "comment_count":

delivers an amazing world, interactivity and genre mashup that screams [i]GIVE THIS DEV MORE MONEY![/i]\n\nYou are a wum. The wuzziest, roundest and possibly laziest wum in the entire Wumhouse. So lazy, that you are a constant nuisance to the Wumhouse's main manager. When you spill your daily dose of ice cream all over the corridor, manager loses it and orders security to throw you over your room's balcony into the garden. After you lose few pounds when somebody steals the TV out of you (which you apparently ate previously) the new quest awaits for you - the search for a new home, happiness and your own little place in the world.\n\nAnd what a world it is! Don't dismiss this game by its child-like graphics! The biggest draw of Wuppo is it's extremely cohesive, vibrant and unique world to explore and experience. Game goes lengths and miles to deliver locations and places that allow you to breathe in the atmosphere. Areas are not only large and visually distinct, but they are also filled to the brim with NPCs, interactive elements and details.\n\nStreets, cities and homes are full of with creatures which seemingly have lives on their own, trams and trains have their own timetables that are real time and not only for show, amusement park rides have their waiting lines that you need to endure, cities have council meetings you can participate in... This game reminded me of Shenmue of all things! Yes, Wuppo doesn't go to such lengths as the Dreamcast classic, but the attention to detail and player interaction make for one of the most inviting and entrancing game worlds in my recent memory... and [i]EVERYTHING IS CUTE AS HECK TO BOOT![/i].\n\nGame world also greatly benefits from the fact that Wuppo heavily rewards you for careful exploration, helping other people along your journey and being generally a good person. Thanks to that, player agency is high and time spent roaming through all the attractions was enjoyable, happy-go-lucky experience, especially when the dialogue and humor is quite good here all across the board and plot kept going naturally at reasonable pace.\n\nAnother unique aspect of Wuppo, is that it doesn't label itself as a particular 2D platformer. Game world is semi-open, seamless and expansive, but it lacks upgrades, doors and interconnectivity of metroidvania. There are bosses and combat, but it's quite simplistic and most of the time you will out of the danger in secure, inhabited areas. There are some small puzzle elements, but this game cannot be called a puzzle-platformer either. This perplexing mix is hard to categorize, but works out very well, despite some wonkiness here and there. I need the commend developers that they sticked to their own breed of 2D platforming game and didn't make another washed out metroidvania. This makes Wuppo [i]an adventure[/i] and not only a set of doors to open sequentially.\n\nUnfortunately, this is a place I need to drop some negatives, because there are a few to speak off. My few first moments into the game weren't so great, because I had a quite difficult time adjusting to the control scheme and inventory management. I played on gamepad and constant visits at inventory screen, to shuffle through the countless items wasn\u2019t very comfortable and felt sometimes pace ruining even further down the line (especially in action sections). You can set up a quick-selections and overall you can get used to the control scheme (which default sets jumps on [i]triggers[/i] of all places), but first hour was pretty difficult for me to grasp. You need to keep that in mind.\n\nIn addition, while I praised the mix of the gameplay mechanics, not everything gels in 100%. I found the default running and gunning lacking a bit of the punch and many puzzles in the areas felt a bit that they escaped from the classic adventure games with some noticeable obtusiveness. Fortunately, since the exploration is the main focus of the game, those problems aren't the dealbreakers, but Wuppo probably won't satisfy more mechanically oriented gamers that would like more snappy combat and/or more puzzle focus.\n\nTake everything I mentioned, add a quite expansive and lovely soundtrack that I consider buying and sincere plot full of silly lore and you get everything to make your final purchasing decision. For me, Wuppo isn't an ideal or exceptionally amazing game, but it remains remarkably unique, full of charm and rare quirks that makes it difficult not to recommend for the asking price, especially if you want to play something really different. You could beat the game in around 7-8 hours, but I personally spent twice of that. I will leave the game quite satisfied and I hope that you will also enjoy your stay...\n\n[i]\"Now go...

Wuppo is a wonderfully charismatic, adorable and silly game. It is packed with humour, and cute and weird creatures (the game almost has its own little language). The world feels so alive and is unbelievably fun to explore, and there are so many secrets and hidden easter eggs to discover. I never found myself getting bored, even after the main content of the story!\nIts adorableness can be misleading, as the bosses are actually quite challenging! However, it can sometimes be difficult to figure out what to do next to progress in the game, as the game only gives subtle hints, if any. For some parts of the game I did have to look up walkthroughs. \nOverall, I absolutely adore this game and you can tell how much love the developers put into it.

R\u00e9sultat, c'est vraiment un jeu \u00e9trange : il y a pas mal de boss, qui ne sont pas inint\u00e9ressants m\u00eame si un peu sacs \u00e0 PV (et j'ai jou\u00e9 en Normal), mais le gros du jeu m'a plut\u00f4t donn\u00e9 l'impression d'un point-&-click (sauf qu'on ne clique pas. D'ailleurs on ne pointe pas non plus, on tire [i]congue[/i] !) puisque la majeure partie du jeu consiste \u00e0 dialoguer avec diff\u00e9rents PNJ et \u00e0 leur rapporter des objets (parfois assez inattendus) pour d\u00e9bloquer un m\u00e9canisme ou r\u00e9soudre des petites \u00e9nigmes. \nEt \u00e7a tombe plut\u00f4t pas mal, du coup, que la grosse force du jeu r\u00e9side dans son \u00e9criture : toutes les interactions avec les PNJ sont vraiment chouettes, il y a vraiment un sentiment hyper positif qui se d\u00e9gage de l'ambiance du jeu sans que \u00e7a soit compl\u00e8tement neuneu ou mi\u00e8vre. Ce n'est pas tant un jeu dr\u00f4le qu'un \"[i]feel good game[/i]\".\n\nPour ce qui est des d\u00e9fauts, maintenant, j'avoue que je sortais de jeux plut\u00f4t acc\u00e8s narration (Life is Strange, The Banner Saga, The Last Door...), donc j'aurais parfois pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 un peu plus d'action ; mais \u00e0 partir du moment o\u00f9 on sait qu'il ne s'agit pas vraiment d'un jeu de plate-forme, d'exploration ou de tir (encore que, les boss sont quand m\u00eame bien pr\u00e9sents), je ne crois pas qu'il s'agisse vraiment d'un d\u00e9faut.\nPar contre, ils ont int\u00e9gr\u00e9 un cycle jour-nuit que je trouve ultra d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able : la nuit -ou sous-terre-, on ne voit rien (je ne sais pas si c'est l'\u00e2ge, mais j'ai l'impression que je passe \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de temps \u00e0 r\u00e2ler contre les probl\u00e8mes de visibilit\u00e9 dans les jeux auxquels j'ai jou\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment :p Parce que je trouve \u00e7a aussi assez confus le jour parfois) ! Pire, avec cette dimension du temps qui passe dans le jeu, il y a plein des fois o\u00f9 on se retrouve \u00e0 attendre : attendre un train, attendre pour monter sur des montagnes russes (que c'est loooooong, et inutile qui plus est...), etc. Et bien s\u00fbr, pendant qu'on attend, il n'y a rien pour aider \u00e0 faire passer le temps (il y a bien des personnages \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de nous qui attendent aussi, mais on ne peut pas leur parler...!)\nBon, ce sont clairement de tous petits d\u00e9fauts qui ne devraient pas vous emp\u00eacher de donner sa chance au jeu, mais j'ai tout de m\u00eame trouv\u00e9 \u00e7a assez aga\u00e7ant en jeu. Et c'est vraiment dommage puisque ce sont clairement des choses qui avaient vocation \u00e0 \"am\u00e9liorer\" le jeu (en le rendant plus vivant) et qui auraient facilement pu \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9s si les d\u00e9veloppeurs avaient fait au plus simple...\n\nAu final, retenez qu'il s'agit du premier \"point&click-plateformer\" dont vous avez entendu parler (haha !), et que c'est un chouette jeu pour se mettre de bonne humeur. N'h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 lui laisser sa chance :)", "timestamp_created": 1509122825, "timestamp_updated": 1509122911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

calling it a Metroidvania, but it is not. It's a sidescrolling game with crayon-style graphics like Yoshi's Island, with a world system that feels similar to a Paper Mario game.\nYou go to town, talk to a bunch of people, do some quests for them, solve a problem, move on to the next town.\nThe gameplay is the adventure itself. It's not a platformer, and there's only combat during the boss battles.\nIt's really charming, I enjoyed the primary story, it did start to get weird in the second half.\nSometimes it's confusing on how to make progress, I used a walkthrough a few times, not really ashamed.\nDon't really know how to praise this game, all it really has going on was the charm. Was enough to keep me happy.

I really liked the look. The only thing I could really say negative about the visuals is that the coloring/shading of certain objects make it difficult to tell if they're in the foreground or the background for platforming purposes, and sometimes things don't visually stand out as important, because they blend so well with everything else. I was stuck in a section with vines early in the game, because I thought there was no way through, but the different dulled shades of brown on the screen actually were meant to convey a passage to drop down lower. Even knowing it's there now, unless I stare directly at it on my screen, I can still miss it.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nIf I was asked to describe Wuppo's music in one word, it would be \"pleasant.\" It's easy listening, and fits well enough with the world and its art style. As soon as I close the game each time, I cannot for the life of me remember a single string of notes, but it does the job just fine and I'll say it's pretty decent while you're playing the game.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nThe game is a mish-mash of three major game types: adventure games, platformers, and...well, not a game type, but Metroid-style boss fights. I have enjoyed these things in other games: solving puzzles /opening new areas up in adventure games (a la the Space Quest or Deponia series), getting around by jumping from thing to thing to explore the world (a la Ori and the Blind Forest and older titles like Super Mario 64), and Metroid-style boss fights (a la Super Metroid, etc.). However, in Wuppo, I did not feel like any one of these gameplay types was handled well.\n\nAdventure games typically work well when you put the player in a fairly small area, rife with vibrant things to interact with, be it characters, contraptions, inventory interaction, etc. The solution should not always be obvious, but if you listen to characters and put the hints together, you can figure out what you need to do. Wuppo puts players in large areas, requiring platforming to navigate to different screens, giving the player hints like \"head underground.\" This means the player should be looking for digging utensils, right? Or stay close to the ground to find an entrance, right? Or find a machine or character who mines/tunnels, right? Nope. You go to the highest point in the entire region to go underground. \n\nYour only clue in the many screens is a bird saying \"this area seems important.\" It doesn't tell you that it's important right now or toward going underground, though. Why in the world would a person think that? The game gives you a completion percentage, and it was around 10% or so at that point, so I figured this would be an important place much later in the game, and immediately looked elsewhere for ways to get underground. This led me to wandering around aimlessly for a couple of hours, platforming my way back up again and again, lost until I finally used a walkthrough to continue. This is a poorly designed puzzle with no alternative solutions and you cannot complete the game without doing it.\n\nAfter that section, required actions to progress became much clearer. However, once you get to a city, many hum-drum side-quest-like actions are needed to raise a number called \"credit\" for the city to 100,000 to expand the city. I found the city already too large with various largely empty screens with a few statues or signs in the background, and a bunch of wums (people) walking around. I didn't want to expand the city due to a lack of motivation, but I'll talk more about that in a moment.\n\nPlatforming can be fun, but when mixed with backtracking due to not knowing where to go became annoying. I was hopping up to the top of the jungle-y region repeatedly, randomly looking for ways underground, and had to do the same platforming over and over again. It was dull. There are also typically no enemies in the game, aside from bosses. I think enemies might worsen things, thanks to the backtracking, but imagine if Super Mario Bros didn't have enemies and there were maybe 5 or so coins to collect in a level. No time countdown, no power-ups, no dying, but numerous places to fall and have to platform your way back up again each time you make a mistake (sans rare shortcut exceptions).\n\nThe Metroid-style boss fights are often big, you shoot them with charged or automatic paint gun shots, and they can often come at you out unexpectedly or with a small hint, which is in line with Metroid as well as Resident Evil games. I actually liked these for the most part. I handled the first 9 bosses, according to the game's boss-kill tracker, and not one boss fight was like the others, which I liked. One boss underground did zoom the camera out significantly, and it was quite difficult to keep track of my character in the mess, which made hitting the boss and avoiding attacks unnecessarily difficult.\n\nThere was also a single stealth section. I needed to steal something from two people. You can only do it at night, so you need to wait until the sun sets, and if you alert the people in the room, you get thrown out and have to do it over again, waiting until the next night, or loading your last save. Stealth elements in games are actually something I love, but Wuppo handled this poorly, in my opinion. Dishes are stacked up in the room, and you have to jump over them and land close to them to avoid alerting the people in the room, but if you knock a dish off, you have to do it over. The worst part is that the thing you need to steal is sitting on a big, breakable container, and the only way to grab what you need, is to land [i]on[/i] the breakable container. Unless you land [i]just[/i] right, the container will fall and break. I probably spent 20+ minutes repeatedly trying to do this, loading my game every time that container fell. It was incredibly frustrating and at no point did I enjoy this part of the game. Any delightful visual charm and peaceful music was undermined by this event.\n\nYou can purchase things in the game, but money seems finite, and many of the items you can purchase are incredibly high-priced. I felt like the economy needed some work, or at least a way to grind a little cash to buy things. I normally get excited when I see shops in games; not so in Wuppo, because I never felt comfortable spending my severely limited funds.\n\nThere [i]is[/i] a train on the west side of the world, and I won't spoil anything about it, but I thought it was charming and a neat idea, and there's a pit stop in the middle of the journey that was pleasant as well. I know it's vague, but I have to admit I liked that, and thought that was kinda innovative.\n\n[h1]Story & Motivation[/h1]\nWuppo has very little story. I would go so far as calling it a \"slice of life\" storyline, actually. I got just over 39% in, and the world isn't in danger, people aren't dying or kidnapped, there's no deep lore, few characters exist and each could be detailed in full in one or two brief sentences, and you are not on any huge quest. You're just trying to get a home. It's quaint and I like the idea of it, as well as its execution for a couple of hours. \n\nBeyond that, however, the lack of story, when mixed in with the large areas without much direction on where to go, made the game eventually become very boring for me.

It's good to go to whenever you need to chill for a bit). Another plus, a lot of characters in the game are just great.

I love the characters, I love the world design, I love the humour (although I might be a bit biased because I'm Dutch, and a few jokes you'll only notice if you speak Dutch). I even like the combat system in contrast to what some people say. I definitely do not regret buying the game.\n\nThe reason I wanted to emphasize that it is a good game is because of one thing that I can't let go. The final bossfight. I'll try to elaborate by not giving any spoilers.\nSummed up: it's really difficult, but not for the right reasons.\nDifficulty in itself is not something that's bad. Just look at games like Dark Souls. The reason that it's not done correctly in this case, in my opinion anyway, is because there are elements to it that make it incredibly annoying. Firstly, there is an attack that is unavoidable. I've read somewhere that it has a pattern and that you can dodge it, but after more than two hours (yes, it actually took me two hours on the highest difficulty) I haven't been able to dodge it more than once, and that was pure luck. \nSecondly, there was a lot of downtime in the fight. I had no choise but to use an exploit in the game to gain enough health to survive. If you know the game, I'm talking about [spoiler] using the coffee hat to slowly regain health while standing in a spot where you don't get hit much [/spoiler]. To my knowledge there isn't another way to gain enough health than to buy loads and loads of food, which requires loads and loads of money, which requires a lot of grinding (= also a lot of downtime).\n\nMaybe it's just me. I don't know. I do not have these complaints about any of the other bossfights.\n\nAnyway, just know that if you're a completionist and you're going to complete Wuppo on higher difficulties, I wish you good luck.", "timestamp_created": 1503861491, "timestamp_updated": 1503861491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34531189": {"recommendationid": "34531189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354512145", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503794351}, "language": "english", "review": "Wuppo is a game with a cute art style and a few charming NPC interactions. Unfortunately, it's not enough to make it a compelling game. I really wanted to like it. It was clearly made with a lot of heart, but in the end it just fell flat and couldn't hold my interest.\n\nOne thing that comes up in other reviews is mention of Metroidvania game play. I think this is doing this game a huge disservice because it lacks any of the hallmarks of a Metroidvania game and it's clearly not trying to be one. If these reviews caught your interest, you will be disappointed.\n\nI honestly wouldn't recommend Wuppo to anyone I know, so it gets a \"no\" from me. However, I wouldn't outright dismiss the game. It has a strong following, so others must be finding something rewarding that just wasn't doing it for me. Proceed with caution.\n\nPros:\n[olist]\n[*]Cute art style\n\n[*]Great soundtrack\n\n[*]Some charming interactions with NPCs\n[/olist]\n\nCons:\n[olist]\n[*]Pacing. The game is mostly running around empty areas doing small errands with little story, mystery or reward to compel you to move forward. When you do finally reach something interesting, like a boss fight or puzzle, it is easy and short lived, making it ultimately unfulfilling.\n\n[*]There are several annoying mechanics, most of which involve waiting. Waiting for the subway in real life can be rewarding. You get to relax, think about things, people watch, etc. Waiting for the subway in a game is just boring.\n\n[*]The world is large, but exploration is neither compelling nor rewarding. Moving around the map feels more like a chore than an adventure.\n\n[*]The combat is clunky, largely unchallenging and simplistic.

It's a metroidvania, bullet hell, RPG with an emphasis on story and exploration. But it doesnt' feel like any of those genres at all. There aren't many combat situations in the game, in fact combat probably takes up less than a quater of the game. Most of it will be spent exploring the world, solving puzzles, running errands and completing quests, interacting with a multitude of characters, collecting items of all sorts, and learning about the game world. Wuppo feels very relaxed, the game isn't that difficult (although many optional challenges and difficulty settings do exist), the writing is innocent and genuinely funny, and it's an overall just enjoyable experience. My only flaw with the game is that moving around the different areas of the world takes a long time, and often becomes tedious. An area select option of sorts only becomes available at the very end of the main story too which seems silly. This game is very short, but the optional content would at least double or triple your playtime.

I am so glad I decided to check it out! It really is a fantastic indie game that reminds me a lot of the Paper Mario games in terms of writing and world development. The art style is really cute and the soundtrack is really fun.\n\nThe gameplay is somewhat of a Metroidvania but it takes its own unique spin on things in terms of controls and inventory management. The game also doesn't hold your hand so it can be somewhat difficult to figure out what you're doing at times, but I personally really like that because it reminds me a lot of the old Nintendo games I grew up playing. I'm really tired of modern games just pointing an arrow in the direction of your next objective all the time. There's also no map so you better know your way around the world.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that your character doesn't look very unique and it can be easy to lose track of your character in certain areas of the game where there's lots of NPCs that look identical to you. My other complaint is a certain train system in the game that runs in real time and it can be a pain waiting for the train at your stop when you just want to move to the next area. Other than that, I don't have any real complaints.\n\nSeriously though, this game is definitely worth checking out! It's a hidden gem amongst all the garbage on Steam nowadays.

This game is definitely my favorite out of the month! Really, what a surprising and unbelievable mini-adventure! Wuppo is a simple action-adventure game where you explore various hub towns, talk to friendly wum NPC's, work for CREDIT, catch the train, and fight crazy bosses. Gametime clocks in at around 6-8 hours after defeating the final boss. \n\nCombat is performed with a gumgumgun and a bazooka (each are customizable) that you control with your mouse or right stick. Menus are simple and intuitive, and there's not too much \"game\" to it outside of talking to people and figuring out how to complete whatever the main objective is. You might accidentally walk into rogue boss encounter, or find yourself doing oddjobs that just pique your curiosity! Lots of stuff for completionist to sink their teeth into, while still being straight-forward for those of us that just want to experience the story and thrill of defeating the boss.\n\nYou need to keep an open mind, however, Graphics aren't everything, and I know you want to go back to playing whatever carrot on a stick fps or moba but this game really can be enjoyed if you give it your time. If it's on sale, and you really liked games similar to Super Paper Mario or point-and-click games then download the demo?\n\nThe only problems I had with this game were getting stuck a couple of times by my own fault. But, this game has some nice walkthroughs that can help you if you ever find yourself saying, \"Oh, I was supposed to do THAT?\".

At first i absolutely loved this game, because the introduction of the game is really well done, the interaction between the main character and the hotelier is hilarious. My love for the game quickly faded when it turned out that the gameplay is mostly superficial platforming and point & click style puzzles with a couple of nice bossfights thrown in there.\n\nGameplay:\nThe first puzzle was already confusing, there are 4 pictures of different races below a switch puzzle, however you had to throw random items on these. I really don't know how they thought a cooking pot resembles a race that looks like a potato.\nSure you have a bird that can sometimes be helpful he basically tells you what to do for the first puzzle but as often he can obfuscate the solution even further. In a later puzzle where you need to summon a dude the bird says the dude can't be summoned right now, so i thought well maybe i have do something else first, turns out he could be summoned you just need to turn off the lights again.\nThat is how i generally felt about the game, i had no idea where to go or what to do most of the time, so i just wandered around aimlessly until i found something to do, reminding me more and more of point and click games \u2013 a genre i hate.\nOther gameplay issues are that you can run out of money to buy an item that is necessary to beat  the game. In Popocity you need to buy an item and there are some jobs you can do to get money, however eventually these jobs become unavailable and then you have no way to get enough money other than going back to old areas and gather some money there which is boring and slow and i was almost ready to abandon the game right there.\n\nPacing:\nWhile the characters and the story are amazing, the pacing isn\u2018t. Throughout the game you can find filmstrips and because money is always tight you have to pretty much watch all of them because you get money as a reward for watching them, they are usually long and boring reading sections, wouldn\u2018t be so bad if it was voiced or funny cutscenes but it is just huge textboxes with a little picture in the background. Right before you are ready to fight the final boss they slap you in the face with a 10 minute read about how the Wuppo world functions.\n\nUser-interface:\nI wouldn\u2018t recommend playing this game with a controller, i couldn\u2018t find a good keybinding steup to make the platforming and using items work in a good way. It is better with mouse and keyboard because you can assign hotkeys to items but it still feels off. Probably because the mouse-wheel scrolls through every single item you have ever collected instead of just the ones you have hotkeyed?

Or maybe i dislike that they designed some menu-items for a controller and others for mouse and keyboard?

Wuppo doesn't need a combat system. \n\nThe things the game does best are most certainly not combat based. It's the world building, the quick characterizations that leave you attached to so-and-so. The facial expressions used to convey an idea or a feeling, and the dialogue that is pretty genuinely inspired. The different races and their history and the borderline feeling of awe as you discover what the game is actually going to be about.\n\nSlapped on to all of that is a platformer-shooter combat system that could have been a fairly direct rip from any game of the NES era. But the controls aren't tight, your aim is clunky, and your mobility is lacking (so you can't dodge some of the bullet-hell-ish attacks you'll be dealing with). You have different weapons, but even though you can bind them to number keys, switching is kind of inconvenient given the number of other important items you'll want to have on that row. So really, you're more or less trading blows and stat checking against every opponent you fight. It just doesn't belong.\n\nAnd that would be forgivable if the combat weren't so large a part of the game. But you probably spend about a third of your time in combat, about a third of your time walking from one place to another, and another third in conversations and actually exploring your current objective.\n\nWuppo does a lot of things right.

It's the kind of game kids should grow up with, look back at, and feel nostalgia for. It's a metroidvania-esque 2D shooter with adventure and bullet hell elements in a mostly civilized world inhabited by charming creatures with a surprisingly well thought-out lore. For the detail oriented: a playthrough was 13 hours for me, the game is about 50/50 story to boss fights, and there's really nothing similar to RPG elements (other than the strong story) despite what people say. Honestly if you like the look of it, it's worth buying. If you're not convinced, try the demo.\n\nI feel like, the best things about [i]Wuppo[/i] (of which there are many) are best experienced rather than summarized, so I've glossed over those and I'm going to go straight to my gripes. I have a big criticism that has to deal with the game's story, and a minor one that frustrated me endlessly.\n\nStory spoilers: [spoiler] I feel like the game missed a real chance to talk in-depth about race problems. I mean it's there, the discussion about \"superior races\" and the subtle ways the wums oppress the other races, the way you're lead to believe the wums basically committed genocide against the fnakkers and that they're proud of it. I'm sure people will say it doesn't fit the tone of the game, that the game did it just fine, or that it doesn't matter but clearly the developers were making some kind of attempt to have the game comment on this. There's so much in the game that's about the races and their differences and the unreliability of one race's narrative over the others (e.g. You never hear what the blussers' characters are like, only that they were the wums gardeners and that they were happy with it. It's only after meeting one and also watching the blusser filmstrips do you understand how wums reduced them to that when their actual ideas and feelings about being gardeners were much more complicated, leading to the reasons they left the garden). I think the devs tried, but there was a real disconnect for me when I saw the fnakkers for the first time and not only were they portrayed as primitive (with African-styled instruments of all things) but their dialogue made them only slightly less violent and cartoonishly evil than what the wums paint them as (not to mention cannibalistic). So ultimately what, the racists who rule the world were right? The people in power should just throw those who oppose them down an endless hole and hope they all die? If anything doesn't fit the tone of the game, I would say it was that likely unintentional conclusion. [/spoiler]\n\nBut what's done is done, and I enjoyed the game irregardless.

It reminded me a lot of Yoshi's Island and other great SNES games. It's story-heavy and character-heavy, with a super-cute art style and I really just loved it. It's genuinely one of the most heartfelt games of its type I've encountered in these sales -- when so many games feel like exersizes in bland, emotionless mediocrity, Wuppo clearly was made with a lot of love, and it shows. I also thought it hit that sweet spot of being challenging and requiring quick thinking, but never getting frustrating. It also (also) feels\u00a0finished, while a lot of these games feel like they rush to wrap up because the dev ran out of time/resources, Wuppo is very much finished and feels finished, and even has an extra area that's totally optional but has some lore.

I will heap praise upon it for days because it's a unique experience, unlike anything else I've played. It's also a very clever and insightful game, the world and mechanics constantly surprise and impress me. The story is rivetting, the gameplay is tough and satifying, the progression is meaningful. The world is full of endless secrets, surprises and fascinating subplots to explore and characters to meet. Most of all, despite its unassuming appearance, Wuppo feels like a real, living world. Like a microcosm of the earth, complete with separate populations, nations, war, intrigue and politics. You begin as a simple face in the crowd (in fact it's easy to become literally lost in the crowd, to forget which little guy is you among the hundreds of onscreen characters) but over time you work with or against the various parties, tribes, nobles, organisations and gods to make the world a better place.\nIt would be difficult to play this game without immediately falling in love with the strange and charming world of Wuppo. If you like your games as a plain single scoop of vanilla then perhaps you'll be turned away, and some may find the combat/platforming too difficult. Some younger players may also be confused or overwhelmed by it all. But otherwise I can't recommend it highly enough.

Essentially you're a white fluff ball trying to save the world with a Gumgumgun. It is a unique and entertaining 2D RPG.\n\n[h1]Positive:[/h1]\n- Quirky but great art style and music.\n- Love the small details, like how certain words shake or are bold when an NPC speaks (for emphasis or emotion) or that you can't cut the line at the amusement park.\n- This game does not hold you by the hand. There are no arrows telling you were to go. No quest log. No map. You have to figure things out by yourself. Talk to NPCs, read what they say.\n- So many side-quests and little interactions. This game really rewards you for exploring.\n- Filmstrips will give you more background information about their world. If you're not interested, you don't have to watch them.\n- Bosses can be challenging. You really need to learn their patterns.\n- Every death is fair. You need to dodge those projectiles or position yourself properly. Get good, scrub.\n- I love that the NPCs are active. They're constantly running around, changing hats, buying items/food.\n- Shoutout to the Dutch developers who sneaked in Dutch words into their game. Big respect.\n- Your happiness is important.\n- Boss run is hard and shows you no mercy.\n- Large number of items, hats, consumables.\n\n[h1]Negative:[/h1]\n- I came across some bugs. Nothing game breaking.\n- Waiting for the train and trams can be boring (but the NPCs have places to go too, the world doesn't revolve around you).\n- I would have liked to have a map.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nWuppo feels like a testament to older games: (1) you're expected to figure things out by yourself, (2) if you die, it's your own fault. I love it that the developers decided to create their game in this way. I'm sure that not everyone will feel this way but I really enjoyed Wuppo.\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

Well, to be fair with Carlo, the Wum at the Wum House service desk, it\u2019s not fun at all cleaning ice cream off the beautiful rugs at the entrance and on the fourth level. Especially now, when all the cleaners have run away to Popocity. It\u2019s only part of the reason; the real reason is that Carlo dislikes cleaning (I\u2019m with you, Carlo), but throwing a Wum out of the Wum House for this, it\u2019s a tad extreme. Hey Wuppo! Did you hear what I say? You have to find a new place to live. Well, start cracking!\n\nWuppo is a platformer/adventure game with good puzzles where you control a cute, round character who has four legs and can make great double jumps. He is part of the Wum race, who are the most intelligent of four main species in the world, but lack of abilities.  The other three races are the Blussers, Splenkhakkers and the nasty Fnakkers. \n\nYou\u2019ll meet a bird, \u201cDenksnavel,\u201d fairly quickly in the game. This bird will give you hints every time you select him. The Allesweters is another character who you will be talking a fair bit with and can be found in different locations. He has a projector and can play the filmstrips collectable items you\u2019ll find within the world. \n\nThe world is extremely well-designed with great locations to discover, and it\u2019s not hard to navigate. Within the main places, you\u2019ll have to help other Wums or species to move forward in the game. Some will be challenging puzzles and others will lead to a fight with big, scary monsters! Please don\u2019t scare the kawum out of me! When you successfully help these characters and make them happy, you\u2019ll be rewarded with extra health points and items which in turn will help you to resolve the next puzzle or challenges in the world. There is a fair bit of reading in this game and you really need to take your time to go through it or you will miss important information. Bear in mind that you can come back to individuals and re-asked questions. The dialogue is really fun and you can select different answers when you interact with each creature.  \nIn some of the destinations, you\u2019ll find stores where you can buy or sell items using the smurt currency. You can obtain additional smurts either by helping other individuals, or when you kill enemies. \n\nFor me the game shines in the puzzles. However, you\u2019ll be fighting interesting bosses and some are not that easy to eliminate. Oh, by the way, you\u2019ll be armed with a GumGumGun which shoots coloured gums. There is a place where you can upgrade your weapons at a specific store in Popocity.\n\nSplendid artwork and the soundtrack is very cute. For the controls, whether you use the mouse and keyboard or the gamepad, they work fine and it is very easy to allocate binding keys to your inventory.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tSplendid artwork\n-\tWell-designed world\n-\tGreat puzzles\n-\tFun fighting bosses\n-\tFun dialogues\n-\tAchievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~    \n\n-\t I think the fighting bosses could be a notch harder\n\nThis game is a gem - thoroughly entertaining and fun to play!\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about this game. It's very reasonable in length for its price and doesn't outstay its welcome by throwing at you boss after boss, and you discovering new environments and new sights to see at a very constant rate. \n\nPROS:\n+Excellent, ADORABLE art style. \n+SPECTACULAR environments for multiple hub areas that were a delight to explore\n+Legit, GOOD bosses that were fun to fight even with the simple controls\n+Wide variety of fun items to use and try out. Even if some didn't serve a purpose, they were still SO CUTE. SO MANY HATS!!\n+The collectible filmstrips that are hidden throughout the game are a DELIGHT to watch! Collecting all of them, even using a guide, is a must!\n+High amount of polish in the game's interaction with characters and items. You can bring a character or item to a character who mentioned the former, and you will almost always get a delightful, distinct conversation.\n+Interesting lore included in the game regarding the various races you meet and play as.\n\nI hesitate to call the below flaws because they are mostly nitpicks and doesn't bring a detriment to the game. I enjoyed my experience regardless.\n\nAreas of Improvement:\n-Respawning enemies. Every new area that you get to (the next screen) will spawn a set number of enemies every time. You can never clear these out and they get irritating after you kill them the Nth time around.\n-There is a part of the game where you have to navigate a huge puzzle room to pass through. This segment was a grind and I spent way too long figuring it out. Coupled with the above complaint, this segment takes points away from an otherwise perfect game. You are definitely rewarded upon completion though.\n-Near the end, a certain character will give an expository lore dump about the world and how to defeat a certain final boss. This was extremely dry and confusing. I appreciate the dev's efforts to flesh out the world, but this could have been done better.\n\nAll in all this was one of the most interesting and enjoyable single player games I've played in a while. If you aren't fazed by the nitpicks, this is a must-buy if the trailer in any way appeals to you.

It just caught my interest and I thought it'd be a fun explorative endeavor to try this game out. But oh boy howdy, I totally didn't expect what was coming next. To sum it up, I guess I found out why the game has a 100% rating.\n\nEverything in this game is just so captivating and weird, it makes you want to explore more and more and learn all about it. The world of Wuppo is colorful and happy, perfectly crafted to keep a smile in your face for the entire duration of the ride. It reminds me of the times I first played videogames, seeing big worlds and exploring everything they had to offer with a deep child-like interest. I didn't think that any games of this generation would be capable of recreating this sensation, but I can safely say that Wuppo does that with utmost grace.\n\nBut enough with vague statements, let's go straight to the precise details about the game:\n\nGameplay-wise, it's a metroidvania/shoot-em-up/adventure mash-up. It has a big emphasis on exploration and interaction. The game doesn't have much combat in it, which would make it rather easy... That is, until you meet the bosses. They might be a bit tough at first, but all are a fair challenge. Most of the actual challenge of the game is in solving puzzles, going through some simple obstacles and fighting bosses. But while you're not actually doing any of that, you'll be mostly looking for interactions or items to collect. The game doesn't really guide you much, so exploring all you can is the best method of progressing.\n\nIn terms of aesthetics, it is extremely colorful and happy, and pretty much everything is criminally adorable. But even with the seemingly simplistic looks, the world feels filled to the brim with life all around. Wherever you go, you will find other creatures just minding their business, moving back and forth while sometimes carrying something. All the movement makes the world feel incredibly lively and believable.\n\nNow about the story... It starts quite small, with you just simply trying to find a new home, but it then somehow manages to go all around. The complexity of the story grows surprisingly fast. There is plenty of lore and backstory to uncover, all only limited to how much of the game you explore. Also, you better keep track of all the new words you'll be learning from the game, there's gonna be quite a lot of them.\n\nAnd about the content. As of writing this, I got 17 hours of play time for the game. And 17 hours is exactly what I needed to finish it with a meticulous search for collectibles. But after reading through the guides, there seems to still be a bunch I've missed. There is plenty of stuff to uncover like new items, more maximum health by doing things that make you happy (yes, you gain more health by merely searching for happiness), the collectible filmstrips to reveal more lore, and the boss fights that are sometimes rather well hidden. And even after finishing the game, you can still try and show off your skills on the boss rush mode you'll unlock then. Exploring the world is extremely rewarding, giving you quite a bunch of surprises.\n\nOverall, I REALLY liked this game, and I am absolutely certain that you will like it too. There is pretty much nothing to hate on it.", "timestamp_created": 1496812256, "timestamp_updated": 1496812256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 135, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.903890", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32198425": {"recommendationid": "32198425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198351253145", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496667689}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7ae0\u9c7c\u7403\u5927\u6218\u53cc11\u5241\u624b\u5403\u571f\u7537!\n\n\u795e\u5c55\u5f00+\u5e9e\u5927\u5730\u56fe+\u8d85\u591a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5185\u5bb9\uff08wuppo:\u52b3\u8d44tm\u53ea\u662f\u60f3\u5403\u4e2a\u751c\u7b52\uff09\n\n4~6\u5c0f\u65f6\u6e38\u620f\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3b\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u60f3\u4f53\u9a8c\u6740\u602a\u8fc7\u5173\u6211\u6709\u4e9b\u5931\u671b\u3002\u603b\u4f53\u4e0d\u662f\u592a\u96be\uff0c\u6253\u6298\u4e70\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u8fd8\u662f\u5f88\u503c\n\n\u65e0\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u82f1\u8bed\u6e23\u4e0d\u8981\u4e70\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1496667371, "timestamp_updated": 1496667371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32195919": {"recommendationid": "32195919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126322681", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507019376}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u51fa\u4e2d\u6587\u4e86\uff0c\u5f88\u68d2~\n\n\nChinese PLZ\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1496657427, "timestamp_updated": 1507018652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529270", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32168333": {"recommendationid": "32168333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112165979", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508320899}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u60f3\u8981\u4e2d\u6587\u2026\u2026\n\nneed Chinese\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1496553887, "timestamp_updated": 1496553887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472122", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32067864": {"recommendationid": "32067864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056365904", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499034241}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is quite something else, for those of you who want to 100% it is going to be an uphill battle as it doesn't tell you excatly how to get anything and even the guides that are out there are missing a good amount of information.

Pain and suffering has no bounds and even video games are not afraid to show these issues. \n\nLovingly rendered blood and body parts fly apart realisticly more and more every generations, and always remind us that its your fault that you caused this. We either become heros in the darkest of times, shattered from what we see, or become the monsters of no boundries to continue the cycle of killing.\n\nand then theres Wuppo\n\nFirst thing i want to say that i really like this game, even though im the sort of person that laughs at dead baby jokes, watches robot chicken, and shockingly of all, enjoy's POSTAL 2 Like 99% of the world population, if they were raised like me. \n\nSo what we have here is a game made by two people and i don't know if their a couple or not, and ironicly their names sound as jibberish as the words you'll hear in the game.  Who comes up with the word splennaker, if i spelled it right. So it throws at you a nonsense dictionary, for a world of nonsense. So after beating the game you'll know more words from this game, then any of the unusual words from a spelling bee.\n\n[u]Gameplay[/u]\n\nNow how do i say this.... its a very unusual metroidvania. How the game works is that it pulls a shadow of the collosus on you, or LISA if your a masochist who thinks suffering is fun, by making alot of boss encounters put to their fullest. Each boss encounter is unique and has the flaws of what happens when you add to much boss varerity. What it means is that the mid-way bosses will be harder then the end game boss. That giant ball of lint has killed me more times then the world ending uhh... attempt at drawing a human face. \n\nThe only way to kill these bosses, (YES i said kill in a game that has the Nintendo kid friendly vibe to it) is to use a varerity of weapons like.... some sort of tube that shoots paint, and a  'bucket' that makes you spit water. This review is gona have more full stops then the prince of persia: sands of time script. They are all ranged and you are always encouraged to use the full mobility of the, Wum? did i say that right and when you defeat enemies, sometimes the drop smurt OK HOW IS THIS DUTCH!?! So you must be confused with all this nonsense as i am, well if you really want to know what the story is, that you are guy finding home, ok end of plot. \n\nSo in between the slightly engaging boss fights it has one of the best use of pacing i have ever seen in a game. What it does is that it makes you uncertian of what will happen next. One time i was talking to an elevator operator to my own whim, and then i see a bunch of chefs run down the hall. I stoped the dialouge and went to see what is going on, then boss fight. If it was most games it would wrestle the controls from you for a cutscene or make you go down an obvious corridor to continue the story, but events naturally unfold in the game. So it feels like something that is worth the time and effort to be involved in, instead of a fancy script sequence with explosions and, oh look the sky looks slightly more realistic.\n\n[u]atmosphere[/u]\n\nEverything about this game has this cuetsy artstyle of a saturday morning cartoon without the bad script writing. It has the perfect blend of crudness and attention to detail to make a massive world. After all were stuck with a cotton ball for legs and have the defensive capability for ourselves as a cotton ball. So its designed to make everything look big and cluttered with special affects.The game can manage under a hundred ai walking simutaniously, and enough bullets going around the screen to embarase a Bethesda RPG. Impressive for something made in a free game maker engine.\n\nSo why does it have this, well to make this strange world of nonsense. Everything is made as it needs to, and makes alot of strange locations that are worth checking out. Especially having to wait real time in a line, A LINE, what other game makes you wait in a line and i spent over 10 minutes waiting for the worst rollercoaster ride, not even worthy for an addition to LEGO land. But i went on, because it felt believable and everyone in the game isn't another dull npc that does their predictable routes.... like a bethesda RPG, ok i'll stop.\n\n[u]conclusion[/u]\nWuppo not even that name links to anything in the game, is a fantastic metroidvania game with satisfying uh, paint gun play. Full of charm, hardwork, and creativity to make something 'Magicaaaaaaaaaaal', ok its a good game, no more sarcasim. It has the friendly 'anyone can play it' vibe without feeling forced and artificial. \n\nIts a game thats you will end up playing once through two days, which is enough. Whats made is made perfectly without overstaying or underwhelming and the best part is, no sequel bait. So the two Men, Women, couple i dunno im not dutch, will make another game and i will look foward to their latest installment.\n\nSo in short BUY THIS GAME.\n[spoiler]unless your busy i dunno i have to much free time, everyone keeps telling me to get a job, but thats ok because its a free country and no ones stopping you from leaving and dying from the cold... am i gonna die.

add some practical details to help make up the minds of anyone that tries to decide if this game is right for them. \n\nFirst off, what immediately will catch your eye, is that the game looks very \"cute\". This cuteness is not is not just added for its own sake, but its aesthetic and style really serves the purpose to complement and add to the feel of the world. What I mean by this, is that the world is very friendly and open to exploration and has generally a very laid back atmosphere. Most of the world's inhabitants that you encounter are friendly and can be interacted with for some possible rewards or information. Some can be triggered into attacking you, but if this happens when you have the bird equipped for example, I can't really blame them.\n\nAt the start of the adventure you are kicked out of the room you live in and become forced to explore the world and find a new place to live. You traverse the world through platforming and this doesn't mean going from left to right; you are free to choose where to go, but you'll quickly find obstacles that you have to overcome in order to reach the newer parts of the map. The platforming itself is very satisfying with good reactive controls and almost no frustration due to there being almost no enemies or hazardous pitfalls. Should you die, or miss a jump and fall all the way down, there are plenty of potential save points that you can quick load to. This may sound that this makes the game too easy, but I feel this was just done to not hinder you in exploring the world. The real challenge lies in the bosses and \"puzzles\".\n\nShould you encounter an enemy, then you can take fire at them with the weapon you have equipped -- this will mostly only be necessary for the boss encounters.\n\nThe controls itself were straightforward enough, but they did require me to get used to them. I use a controller and when you fire your weapon you control where the attack goes with the right analog stick (360 degrees). I normally use the \"A\" button -- XBOX controller -- for jumping, but this makes attacking while jumping hard to pull off. The game therefore starts with the jump button being assigned to the left bumper (LB), but after some experimenting I decided to switch this to the right bumper (RB) instead. The game lets you re-assign any button you want. It does seem that because of the way you control your attack, this is a platformer that is easy to be played with a mouse and keyboard.\n\nMost of the weapons you use will fire an continues stream of particles at the location you are pointing to. This means that the bosses have plenty of hit points and you usually have to hit them a lot of times to whittle them down. The bosses can be quite challenging, but they often are also a highlight of the game. I can think of 7/8 off the top of my head that had some really creative and memorable designs in both their looks as well as in their way of fighting -- usually with multiple stages -- that can easily match up with the ones from various classic 2D platformers in terms of the quality of gameplay. They didn't add the boss run as a feature for nothing.\n\nTo make the boss encounters easier, you can up your health from 100 to a maximum of 200. You can get these bonus \"feel good\" health points in a variety of ways, like simply just talking to certain NPC's, or participating in events. I once got a point by just passing a painting I had made that had been hung up in the hall. The most straightforward way is to find and collect the various \"filmstrips\" hidden throughout the world. When watching them some of these will give you a point, but by collecting all of them in an area, this automatically gives you 5 life points. It doesn't sound like much, but the bosses can hit hard and most boss encounters have parts where you can get back lost health. So, any way to survive an onslaught, raises your chance to be victorious.\n\nOne part of the game that can be off-putting to some, is that it features situations where you have to come up with a solution in order to proceed further into the game -- it has adventure game elements after all. I'm hesitant to use the word \"puzzles\" even if it is what it boils down to, because this can be associated with the minigame-like scenarios you can find in point and click adventure games; Wuppo is more action oriented. Most of the time you are required to search for certain items, which you then use to open a new path. Talking to the NPC's can give you info to what items you need and what use they have. Also, equipping certain items can trigger events. Personally I would say that I encountered only a couple of situations where I was stumped for a bit, but I can understand that some people don't like this element. However, there are some good guides available now, so you can look up a solution for if you get stuck.\n\nWhat I consider to be the best part of Wuppo is its fantastic world and the amount of world-building that goes on in it. A lot of  people are raving about the \"charm\" of this game and indeed, it oozes it. This is of course highly subjective on my part, but my experience with Wuppo, I can best describe as Nintendo-esque. Honestly, while playing Wuppo, I immediately started comparing it to the Zelda and Paper Mario games. Of course, Wuppo is not as polished as what Nintendo produces, but we can't hold an indie game to those standards. Anyway, the background of the world; all the interactions with its characters; the situations you find yourself in; and how the characters behave in all of the different areas in relation to each other, it all fits and comes together wonderfully. You really get the felling that you are walking around in a fleshed out world where all of the characters have their own lives and way of thinking. As an example, in one part of the game you have to use a train, this train has an in-game schedule, so it can be that you have to wait in line during which time you get to observe Wums going all over the place. Then, when the train arrives, you have to wait a bit for the departing passengers and after that the cleaning crew. The wait isn't very long -- less than a minute --  but these little details add so much to the world and they can be found everywhere; clearly a lot of love went into this game.\n\nThe soundtrack fits the game perfectly and adds so much to its charm. Looking back, there really are quite a lot of terrific tunes that build up the atmosphere.\n\nAll in all, it's hard to give Wuppo an objective numerical rating. I could say it deserves an 8 out of 10, because it does have some rough edges, but when the game works, I felt like playing a 10 out of 10 game. It has such a uniquely genuine feel to it, which is too abstract to really factor into the sum of its parts; the people that are attuned to its vibe, will enjoy it immensely for this reason alone, but this will not necessarily apply to everyone. Neverthelessl, the world-building; the interactions with the varied colorful charactars; the boss encounters (most of them); the art style; the terrific soundtrack; the sense of humor and whimsical nature; the fun platforming; and the writing of the story and various dialogues, all contribute to an amazing game, that will put a smile on almost anyone's face and deserves to be labeled as a \"gem\".\n\nWow, this review went on longer than I thought it would, but I had some free time on my hands. For people who don't like ramblings like this, just skip it.", "timestamp_created": 1485950629, "timestamp_updated": 1486004668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0,

(In fact I believe you could actually complete the game and only earn 3 of them).\nDevs are hugely responsive, fixing bugs as they are found and helping solve user problems (even user caused user problems).\nPlatforming difficult is fairly easy making the game a mix of story, exploration and boss fights.\n\nAfter I had been playing this for a while my bf started asking me what I was playing. Normally I have to drag him kicking and screaming towards anything I want him to play. This he had installed and was waiting to play almost immediately.\n\nThus followed a ridiculous back and forth. I mean I probably would have stopped after finishing the game on normal, but he decided to try insane and of course then I had to as well...\n\nI totally suck at the bosses. Well I have persistance on my side which is how I eventually got through insane,  but I suspect a complete Boss Run (which requires some actual skill) will forever be beyond my grasp.

The game's technically structured into levels or I guess the more fitting description would be regions, as you keep unlocking the next one as you progress but the world is still open and explorable if you want to backtrack for instance, and you even do unlock fast travel very very late game, each area will have a different objective to progress to the following one which will usually be about solving a puzzle, obtaining a certain item or fighting a boss of which there are 17 of them\n\nI think most of the bosses are generally well designed and fun to fight against but they do get a little bit bad near the end of the game, where you'll fight what feels like just a bunch of regular enemies, but they're considered a boss for some reason as if it was inflating the total boss count and I don't want to spoil too much here but I don't really like the final boss all that much either, sure it's hard but I think that fight is more of a clusterfuck of projectiles than anything else, also your weapons aren't really all that great at shooting directly upwards but that guy tends to float around anyways often times just barely out of range for your weapons, but then there's the Giant Dust Monster or the Rock Statue which are some of my favorites which were challenging but also really enjoyable to fight, they all have their own unique patterns which you have to learn to tackle them efficiently, sure you may die a few times finding out those patterns, but that's part of the fun of fighting these bosses to me, difficulty varies between normal, hard and insane, which changes how much damage enemies do to you, I personally went with hard for a decent challenge but nothing too far out there\n\nThe puzzles on the other hand even if there are few of them, they are all well put together in my opinion, they're not overly complex or anything but they play on the game's lore quite nicely, there's a big temple near the end and I think that's the best example of it in the game, it really is something quite good and there are definetly some crazy surprises there, part of which is some of what I mentioned about the sountrack too but I really don't want to ruin it for you\n\nAlso about the objectives I mentioned earlier they're usually good too but there is one big exception around the mid game where you go to this city and it has this \"credit\" system, where you can contribute to increase an overall score of sorts of the town and you can do it through a couple different minigames which are fun don't get me wrong here, but the overall score that you need seems to be way more than it should've because you have to repeat these minigames a looot to get there, to the point where it gets really repetitive and almost feels like it was done to pad out the game a little bit, I'm not a fan of waiting mechanics in general but I do think they have their time and place, like in the Splenkhakker park for instance where you have to wait around for the rides and stuff, I mean it's just a fun optional thing and I think it adds some charm to the region overall\n\nAnd that's one thing I think that this game's honestly full of, charm, I mean Splenkhakker park? The names of these races are kinda wacky, I don't know if it means anything, I mean the developers are Norwegean so there is a language barrier there I suppose, but there's also the humour in the dialogue and it's all upbeat and lighthearted, it's definetly a really nice experience when you meet a new character and get to talk to them which will usually make you smile just reading what they have to say, the story is rather simple in the grand scheme of things, but it's things like these that carry the game and elevate it to something really unique and special and that ties in to the collectables that this game has which are Filmstrips which show you a little bit more about this game's world and lore, or just some funny situations and then there's Happyness, which you can get by doing all sorts of stuff around the levels or on conversations with NPCs where you choose a specific dialogue option or do something for them, not your typical quests or anything by the way, the game's more clever than that, there are also a few fun secrets and easter eggs out there so I'd definetly recommend you keep your eyes peeled while exploring and also return to some older areas once you're late into the game\n\nSo overall this game's gonna take you around 12 to 15 hours to beat depending on how much you want to explore and all that, but personally I really think this game's worth it, it's a really nice fun experience that doesn't really take itself all that seriously and I think we need more platformers like this, it kinda reminds me of Hell Yeah! Wrath of the Dead Rabbit, which was a similar game in spirit in my eyes, like the way I felt playing it, it's hard to explain and I'm probably sounding kinda pretentious here so I'll just say this, I'd definetly recommend Wuppo for pretty much almost anybody and it's gonna make you really happy while playing it and for just $15 dollars or your regional equivalent I think it's a nice purchase", "timestamp_created": 1479928519, "timestamp_updated": 1479928569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501312", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26780471": {"recommendationid": "26780471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029629140", "num_games_owned": 435, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476194087}, "language": "english", "review": "This is really enjoyable game with interesting world!

I thoroughly enjoyed nearly every minute of the game that I played, and will certainly revisit it in the future. The storyline and dialogue can be a bit abstract at times, but I found the humor in the game spot on, and amidst much laughter I came down with several lingering cases of permagrin! Certain cutscenes along the storyline are very visually intense, and I found myself very immersed in what was occurring. The ending of the game becomes a bit... confusing (as the lore gets dramatically expanded and [spoiler] you're given \"fast travel\" access throughout the world, to tie up loose ends or keep exploring [/spoiler]), but I felt very satisfied after beating the game and pleased with my accomplishment.\nSome of the bosses are quite challenging, and the inventive/creative design of the world and its inhabitants always kept me smiling and impressed. The music was also quite catchy! At some point I will certainly buy the soundtrack, as I'm finding certain songs stuck in my head throughout my recent days. Wuppo's music will continue to play in my head as serve as a mnemonic draw to the unadulterated fun I had while playing this game.\n\nOverall, I sincerely enjoyed my time with Wuppo, and believe it deserves a lot more recognition that it currently has.

I may replay the game and update my review in the near future.\n\nCAUTIOUS RECOMMENDATION\nIn short, the game is fun but falls short and kind of disappointing.\n\nI am impressed with Wuppo. The world building is fantastic and the developers went at length to make the world as organic as possible. Exploration and problem solving are enjoyable despite being frustrating at times. Some of the bosses are very fun, too, and the soundtrack is memorable and a joy to listen to. Wuppo is also very charming, with many funny moments and easter eggs.\n\nBut there are many problems with the game that keep it from its full potential. Some boss designs are questionable and started to drop the ball close to the end of the game, there is an entire portion of the game that is a literal grind and has very questionable navigation structure, the game forces you to wait at times (the developer has stated this was intentional because he found waiting to be half the fun at amusement parks, meanwhile my family always tries to get fast passes in order to skip lines), and some mechanics felt entirely pointless and added tedium (there is a tiny area in the game that you spend only a few minutes in but for some reason it has its own currency). Also the game is very short and you are at the end of the game before you know it.\n\nAfter I killed the final boss, I recollected my experience through the game only to realize that I didn't do much at all. It feels like that the game does not have much content in the end because a large portion of the game is padding. The game took 7 years, but Wuppo does not feel like a 7 year effort.\n\nSo with these in mind, I give Wuppo a cautious recommendation. You will enjoy exploring the game world and its secrets, solving problems to progress, but be mindful that it will make you do tedious things and the game does not last very long.

I've been *loosely* following this game ever since its announcement, which was about 6 or 7 years ago. Was it worth the wait and the money? I would definitely say so. The game is charming, the pacing is decent, and it feels like a new and enjoyable game in the midst of all the mainstream games. I've had a blast playing it, and would probably replay it in the future.\n\nThere are definitely some bugs that are still in the game, as well as some kinks to be worked out, but along with the community's help and the discussions taking place in the Wuppo Discord group, the devs are actively working on amending the game's balance and any glitches that are still in the game. I haven't experienced any bugs that are too major, just some minor inconveniences that are easily fixable that don't really affect my opinion on the game.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend buying and playing this game. Combined with the great soundtrack and the cute visuals, this game was an amazing and fun adventure. Super enjoyable!\n\n[spoiler] WEH!

The combat is also good, although simplistic, with unique and challenging bosses that appear in the most unexpected places. The only real criticism I have with Wuppo is that if you're somewhat of a completionist like me, aquiring everything is a massive undertaking, specifically when it comes to buying all the unique items from all the shops.

A world filled with Wums, Blussers, Splenkhakkers, Fnakkers and a handful of other races. You are a Wum living in the Wumhouse, a house where every Wum can live in leisure, but seeing more and more Wums leaving to the new underground city of technical development Popocity. After you've made a mess of the hallways in the Wumhouse, AGAIN, you've been thrown out of the house. Now homeless, your adventure begins where you meet other characters, fight strange bosses, solve enviromental puzzles, help communities, save the world, and find a new home.\n\nStrong Points:\n\n+ The world - Building a world ain't easy, especially one with races and technologies so different from ours. But the developer managed to not only create a consistent world, but one that feels very alive and full of things to explore. A great achievement.\n\n+ NPCs and their interactions - The world is filled with small little creatures with small little lives. They don't feel like static objects that speak the same sentence their whole lives, but as real and alive creatures. Big plus for writing and coding all these dialogues for all the little interactions, even when they are insignificant to the plot, just to keep the immersion.\n\n+ Music - The soundtrack is gorgeous and fits to every situation our little Wum is thrown into. A great achievement by the composer.\n\n+ Animations - Very fluid. Love how the expression of our little Wum changes at different dialogue options.\n\n+ Difficulty - The bosses and environmental puzzles are sometimes hard and challenging, but never unfair. Great job.\n\nAverage Points:\n\nT Gameplay - You don't play Wuppo for it's inventive gameplay: it's your average Indie Metroidvania. But that isn't needed for a game like Wuppo, the gameplay is the medium you use to explore and interact with the world, and it does that just fine.\n\nWeak Points:\n\n- Art style - Sorry Lars, but most of it looks like it was made in MSPaint. Sometimes it looks nice, and sometimes it's just plain ugly. However, the art style is consistent throughout the game, so it doesn't break the immersion.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWuppo is a charming game with a great world to explore that feels very alive.

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE MAJOR ISSUE.\n\nI think about games that hit the closest to real, honest classic gaming. Authentic and not forced or fabricated. For example, I think Bleed is the closest an indie game has gotten to a legitimate Gunstar Heroes successor. With Wuppo, I think this is the first indie game I've played to feel, in its presentation, with its cast of quirky characters, with its music, its gameplay systems, etc. like a Nintendo-made game. It may not LOOK like one (The art is more like a very cute spin on An Untitled Story), but it sounds, acts and feels like one in just about every way. If you don't like the direction the Paper Mario series has gone, this game is not Paper Mario, but it has that same kind of writing, and worldbuilding, and overall fun and adorability.\n\nThere is a huge amount of bosses (17!!), a theme park with rides you can ride on, an underground city with jobs (we'll get to that), an apartment complex full of nutty people, a forest tribe of flower people, islands in the sea to find, another dimension entirely-- the world of Wuppo is enormous. Not quite the size of a game like Opoona (another similarly quirky and wonderful game), but much larger than you'd expect on first playing the game.\n\nThe combat and general interface are relatively simple. Point and click to fire, WASD to move. You can throw items on pedestals and give items and money to people for trade. Part of the fun of the game is finding things in shops that you have no idea what they are, and sometimes you might need them. Why does a city sell a diving helmet? Why does an apartment sell rocks? You'll find out!\n\nOkay, let's talk about the elephant in the room, and I haven't read reviews lately so I dunno how people will feel about this, but: THE POPOCITY SECTION OF THE GAME IS REALLY TEDIOUS. You will spend about 3 hours in Popocity, an underground city underneath the Wum village, trying to build Credit for the city in order to finance the city's big expansion. This means getting jobs, performing tasks, buying items from shops, staying in the hotel, etc. \n\nThis is all fine, and I liked the concept INITIALLY. The problem is that there just isn't enough to do here. You can sell newspapers (and after doing it 8 times you unlock a side quest, which-- by the way, that tells you something about the tedium doesn't it? Doing the same minigame 8 times?) but the only change is how many papers you deliver, and whether it's to Central or to Old Town. You can participate in debates at City Hall once a day, but there are very few topics (we already decided on the painted smakoffel!! Three times!!) . You can find Kneft monsters for Credit once a day, which only varies slightly in how the enemy waves spawn. You can buy items from a seedy shop at outrageous prices for 1000 credits a pop. And you can work in the factory, which consists of jumping up and down on a seesaw over and over again.\n\nThere's just not enough to any of these jobs to make grinding out the credit fun. Each time you do several jobs and go back to the Credit final tally you'll be left with a feeling of \"really?? I still have that much to go??\". I feel like this can be fixed either by increasing the credit that jobs give or by providing more variety to the jobs. For example, why not more topics at City Hall? Why not a police job tracking down criminals in the city? What if a machine breaks down at the factory and you can get extra Credit for fixing it? If the message is \"work is supposed to be tedious\", then it comes across the same as the infamous treadmill from Super Paper Mario -- in the end, it's still tedious and that's all that matters.\n\nALL THAT SAID, Wuppo is a fabulous game. I can't not speak about that section because it makes up a third of the game, but the other two thirds are so weird, so wild, so wonderful, so witty, so silly, that it kept me smiling all the way to the end.

The controls and animations are fluid and feel natural, and there's so much to discover and learn in the early game that I have to give it a quick review for those curious.  Wuppo has the same charm that I would expect from an entry in Yoshi's series of games or better yet, Kirby.  The world is immediately presented to you as being well-established and it makes no apologies for bringing you, the player, in before you have any clue as to what it's all about.  Tutorial nonsense is kept at an absolute minimum, with only the most obtuse details being presented in easy to digest comments from NPCs.  The music is brilliant and adds a level of depth you'd think was only reserved for games in much different calibers; the soundtrack is refreshing and simply breathtaking, with some elements being pseudo-rhythm based.  The first couple boss (I think?) encounters were super hard but gave off that lightbulb moment when I realized the pattern and how the arena had to lend itself to my advantage.  \n\nAn open world that doesn't hold your hand but also doesn't try to diminish your abilities at every turn- why can't more games understand this simple concept?  Yes, there is a gap between Nintendo Hard and Tryhard Hard.\n\nWuppo is not a game that panders to anything, really.

I had nothing but her word to go off of, and boy am I glad I gave this game a shot.  Going in, the first thing you'll notice is that this game is hilariously cute.  But the deeper you fall down the rabbit hole, the more you realize how much this game has to offer. It has a lot of charm and a lot of heart, especially seeing how it mostly comes from only two indie developers, and the soundtrack is very engrossing (I'd recommend getting the ultimate edition if you've got the money for it).  The puzzles can be very tricky at times, but they're never too overwhelming--especially since you have an in-game guide that can toss you hints if you're stuck.\n\nThe game has quite a few bugs here and there, but there are save spots all over the place and it literally takes a second to save, so as long you don't forget to pop into one, you should never lose more than a couple minutes' progress from a crash.  The devs have been VERY involved with taking feedback from players and are actively seeking out bugs to fix for their next update, and it just goes to show how much they care about the game and their fans.\n\nAll in all the game will take up about 13 hours on your first playthrough, many more if you're a completionist or want to give one of the higher difficulties a shot.  Between the cute characters, beautiful scenery, enchanting soundtrack, and fascinating story, I'd say this is definitely worth a buy.\n", "timestamp_created": 1475367503, "timestamp_updated": 1475367503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25807159": {"recommendationid": "25807159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050794696", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475683143}, "language": "english", "review": "As someone who is not a fan of platformer games, I'm so impressed with this little gem.

The graphics are very stylized (in a very good way), the gameplay is fun with unique bosses and the story is very adaptable to different play styles. The music definitely has a solid control over the mood; sometimes it makes you feel energetic and lighthearted, though other times it captivates you and makes you feel deep. Geez, before I ramble on way too much, if you enjoy fun, beautiful games, please give this game a go.

It is just what it is, it's a game with good art that is fun. That's what I mean when I say it feels like an old indie game -- it's not trying to copy anything, it's got 2d art because it's made by some animators and that's what they're good at, and it's funny because it is good for writing to be funny and for people to have fun.

There are a variety of bosses and challenges packed inside the game waiting for you to face them.\nI enjoyed collecting film strips and reading into the backstory of the world I was in (along with hilarious NPCs that threw their two cents in every now and again).\n\nThere are so many hidden secrets in this game, its almost impossible to find them all on your first playthrough. You can challenge yourself with INSANE mode, or just kick back during normal mode.\nThe enemies in the game aren't repetitive, and all the boss fights are pretty unique. You can tell the developers put a lot of hard work into this game.\n\nYou also have an insanely large inventory, so you'll most likely never run out of room during your adventures. With that, there are a good handful of hats to collect in the game to customize your character whenever you please.\n\nThe game's overall smooth controls make it very nice to move around in. (I often found myself jumping all over the place whenever I got the chance because it was honestly really satisfying seeing a little blob do sick backflips).\nThe game also pays attention to small details such as kicking rocks around as you walk past them, knocking over dishes if you jump around them, etc, so that's kind of a big deal.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the game is Wonder Splenk. Its literally a theme park. You don't need to go there to progress through the story, however, there's no reason to pass it up. At Wonder Splenk, you can go on rides, get your fortune told, and play mini games. Be careful though; venture too far out into the sea and you'll be greeted by.. well, that's for you to find out.

Well, you might like Wuppo. \n\nFull disclosure; I have been given a key before the time of writing this review. However I can confidently say I've enjoyed my time with the game thusfar. What starts off as a silly plot about a Wum dirtying a hallway, quickly throws you into a world and quest bigger than yourself. A very charming world, I might add. From the angry desk manager Carlos to elevator boy to loudmouthed Denksnavel, the first minutes set a great atmosphere. Don't let it's cartoony silliness fool you, however, when it comes to the gameplay. Wuppo asks you to pay attention and a lot of it.\n\nExploration is a big part of Wuppo and it rarely outright states where you have to go next. It's story is a puzzle as much as individual sequences and boss fights can be. Wuppo has little intention of holding your hand and it will let you know. Early, frustratingly and brutally. Fortunately there are save points a plenty and the reward of solving a puzzle, beating a platforming section or wooping some boss ass is all very satisfying. Don't get discouraged by some of the harder or more hidden bits, it pays off in the end.\n\nWhat I liked most about Wuppo is how it marries it's world and gameplay with it's overlapping atmosphere. There's a boss somewhere midway that the further down you get his health, the more you feel like bullying him than vice versa. There's a boss whose projectiles you have to get hit by just to survive, instilling a feeling of desperation. There's a part in the game that tells you to [i]get a job[/i]. It's filled with characters going about their lives, whose actions are just as important to the world as yours and individual NPCs their decisions are reflected in map and level design. All of this makes Wuppo, even with it's silly exterior, feel like a strongly immersive game. Just... Be ready to work for some of that experience.\n\nOverall, if you like puzzle-platforming, possess the power of observation and enjoy a zany sense of humour, I think you'll enjoy getting lost in the

and none i play with WASD and mouse) and many items to pickup and try out.\n\nWould love to see a sequel with a multiplayer mode (coop and a few fun versus modes) for several players and an even

It's a quirky, beautiful mess of a game that I'm glad I played. In terms of scope, this game feels like a true passion project. The world Knuist & Perzik have created is really eye-opening, considering they take heavy handed topics and masterfully make them comedic or adorable. Wuppo comments on things like religion, racism, and how apathetic the world can be in a cutesy, MS-paint-esque art style. This makes Wuppo feel both adult and childish, which is a difficult balance to strike.\n\nAll in all, as a package, for 15 dollars, I believe it's worth a go. The game will run you about 8-10 hours, or upwards of 15 if you plan to do everything. It's important to note that nothing in the core gameplay loop feels stale after a while, which is something I can't say about a lot of games. That might have to do with the fact that this game isn't very long to begin with, so the less interesting bits don't overstay their welcome anyways.

Wuppo is a funny and adorable game about you trying to find a new house. There are A LOT of secrets so try to find em all. You can get hats for your character, fight bosses, and a lot more. \n\nPROS:\n1. \"Scallywag\" (your character) is adorable\n2. So many customization options for hats and weapons\n3. game will take a while to complete\n4. Secrets!\n5. Great and original bosses.\n\nCons:\n1. for some people. the bosses may be too hard.\n\nOverall, i highly recommend this game, its amazing and i love the art style and all the unique characters and stuff you can do in this game. Your not even forced to do it all and if you find a side quest or something. its not displayed anywhere, (which i love because with games like zelda, my journal is FILLED with sidequest markers.) \n\nOVERALL SCORE: 10/10 i love this game already from the start.", "timestamp_created": 1515020135, "timestamp_updated": 1515020135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39009733": {"recommendationid": "39009733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049067091", "num_games_owned": 434, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 523, "last_played": 1514903210}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc6cc\ud478\uc5d0 \uc138\uacc4\uc5d0 \uc624\uc2e0\uac78 \ud658\uc601\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\ud0c4\ud0c4\ud55c \uc138\uacc4\uad00\uc5d0 \ucc2c\uc0ac\ub97c \ubcf4\ub0c5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1514983862, "timestamp_updated": 1514983862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39003384": {"recommendationid": "39003384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167175420", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 1112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1112, "last_played": 1515789583}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5e74\u5ea6\u6700\u4f73\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u6e38\u620f(\u7b11)", "timestamp_created": 1514967941, "timestamp_updated": 1514967941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39002186": {"recommendationid": "39002186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326223768", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 109, "last_played": 1514971710}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u840c\u7684\u5c0f\u56e2~~", "timestamp_created": 1514964443, "timestamp_updated": 1514964443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39001853": {"recommendationid": "39001853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099019804", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 379, "last_played": 1515908455}, "language": "koreana", "review": "Cute, and Fun", "timestamp_created": 1514963386, "timestamp_updated": 1514963386, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38980835": {"recommendationid": "38980835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198440846140", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514914003}, "language": "schinese", "review": "steam\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\u628a\u6211\u7684\u4e0a\u4e00\u7bc7\u541e\u6389\u4e86\uff0c\u90a3\u5c31\u4e0d\u591a\u8a00\u603b\u4e4b\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u5f3a\u63a8", "timestamp_created": 1514913451, "timestamp_updated": 1514913451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568345", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38966622": {"recommendationid": "38966622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257999920", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 232, "last_played": 1514819184}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7adf\u7136\u8fd8\u6709\u8fd9\u4e48\u840c\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff1f\uff1f\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1514884480, "timestamp_updated": 1514884480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39418938": {"recommendationid": "39418938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148772037", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 464, "last_played": 1516212641}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud55c\ubc88\uc2dd\uc740 \ud574\ubcfc\ub9cc\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub2e4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ub108\ubb34 \uadc0\uc5ec\uc11c", "timestamp_created": 1516212760, "timestamp_updated": 1516212760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

If extra is really good and unlimited excellent, alternative is just nearly perfect. Everything is linked to unlimited and even extra, nothing is left to random.\n\nThe script and the writing are way better, the pacing is excellent(the beginning is the weak point, chapter 2 and 3), the localisation is pretty good(except the dude thing for a girl that i'm not very fond of, but I'm french so I don't know if it is accurate or not) and the dub is as in the former games always convincing. For the plot, I won't spoil, but it is one of the best stories I have ever read, even taking into account books, movies,......(for one week I've used most of my free time to play this game, so you can trust me). I think even the Stein's gate aren't as good as Muv-Luv.\n\nA true masterpiece, for at least 40 hours you will experience one of the best novel ever made(it's more than a game for me).

moments, an amazing soundtrack, and better production value than Muv Luv could make one expect. It is not the best rated title on VNDB for nothing, and its middle part is a lesson of storytelling.\n\nIts other main achievement is to complete Muv Luv, and to bring it to a quality level that's in definitive not too far off from this entry. Reading MLA brings an enormous lot to one's enjoyement of the first game. But its reliance on the latter also plagues the first part of the game (perpetual reference to both Extra and Unlimited, repetition of events with many not-so-impressive twists). To get all the details, I would recommend to go through Muv Luv once more just before jumping into Alternative.\n\nThe cast of MLA is...okay. Most of the characters are enjoyable (and benefit greatly from having been elaborated throughout the first entry of the series), even if they pale when compared to the cast of more character-driven VN's (Dies Irae, Steins:Gate, ...). Shirogane might be, in fact, the most irritating, especially towards the end of the game, which is a problem considering you get to spend so many hours inside of his head.\n\nThe plot is great, with a couple of issues. The beginning tends to drag, the middle is a masterpiece, and the ending is a slap in the face. However, \"the middle\" stands for the 30-40 hours between the introduction and the final chapter, which hit me hard like no other fiction work before, and singlehandedly earned MLA its worldwide fame. And hey, even if the start is slow, it is always more enjoyable than Extra. About the ending...well, some people love it, but I almost felt insulted by the path chosen by the writers. Nothing grave enough to prevent me from considering the whole story as one of the most enthralling epic provided by the VN medium.\n\nProduction value-wise, we are suprisingly well-off. While many assets are directly taken from the first entry in the series, the CG's are gorgeous, the voiceover is as great as you might expect, and the soundtrack...well the soundtrack is my favorite part of this masterpiece of a game.\n\nWhen I finished MLA, I was certain that game would be another 10/10 in my book, having provided me one of the most intense reading experiences of my VN reader life. However, as I am writing this review, I am forced to take a step back, especially when comparing it to other games I recently finished. If I wasn't the mecha/military drama junkie I am, would I have enjoyed this game as much as I did ? Would reading Extra and Unlimited be a worthwile time investment for what MLA ultimately has to offer ? Would I be able to withstand the crappy ending ? The cringy dating sim-y romance ? I still don't have the answer to these questions. Howerver, I know that I had a blast reading Muv Luv Alternative, a highly demanding, somewhat flawed, but generous game with a surprsingly broad appeal.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1513399490, "timestamp_updated": 1513399555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38281082": {"recommendationid": "38281082", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979034098", "num_games_owned": 646, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510380441}, "language": "english", "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5JICa_ZxBk", "timestamp_created": 1513176153, "timestamp_updated": 1513176223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.441353", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38258889": {"recommendationid": "38258889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070087647", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511946530}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7eed\u63a5\u672c\u7bc7\u4e24\u90e8\u3002\nAlternative\u7bc7\u5168\u7bc7\u7ed9\u4eba\u4e00\u79cd\u201c\u5929\u5c06\u964d\u5927\u4efb\u4e8e\u662f\u4eba\u4e5f\uff08\u7565\uff09\u201d\u7684\u611f\u89c9\uff0c\u7537\u4e3b\u5149\u73af\u7206\u8868\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u53c8\u5728\u4e0d\u65ad\u5582\u5c4e\uff0c\u5403\u5c4e\u5403\u5230\u9ebb\u6728\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4e00\u5207\u5374\u53c8\u663e\u5f97\u987a\u7406\u6210\u7ae0\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6ca1\u6709\u7ecf\u5386\u8fc7\u7edd\u671b\uff0c\u4eba\u5c31\u4e0d\u80fd\u6210\u957f\u3002\u7537\u4e3b\u672c\u60f3\u51ed\u7740\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5929\u8d4b\u548c\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u7ebf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ecf\u5386\u5927\u663e\u8eab\u624b\uff0c\u5374\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd8\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u4e8b\u662f\u4ed6\u60f3\u4e0d\u5230\u7684\uff0c\u5931\u8d25\u611f\u6cb9\u7136\u800c\u751f\uff0c\u4ed6\u60f3\u9003\u907f\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u786e\u9003\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u53c8\u53d1\u73b0\u9003\u907f\u662f\u6ca1\u7528\u7684\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5f7b\u5e95\u6b63\u89c6\u773c\u524d\u7684\u7edd\u671b\u514b\u670d\u5b83\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u8ba9\u539f\u672c\u548c\u5e73\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u4e0d\u53d7\u6ce2\u53ca\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e4b\u540e\u7537\u4e3b\u6210\u957f\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0d\u5355\u5355\u662f\u4ed6\u6682\u65f6\u56de\u5230Extra\u7bc7\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u8001\u5e08\u89c1\u5230\u4ed6\u65f6\u6240\u8bf4\u5f97\u90a3\u79cd\u6c14\u8d28\u4e0a\u7684\u622a\u7136\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u662f\u9762\u5bf9\u4ed6\u4eba\u5bf9\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u5bf9\u81ea\u5df1\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u4e0a\u6709\u4e86\u8d23\u4efb\u611f\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u767d\u767d\u6d6a\u8d39\u8fd9\u4e00\u5207\u3002Alternative\u7bc7\u540e\u534a\u90e8\u5206\u7ed9\u4eba\u4e00\u79cd\u76f4\u51fb\u5fc3\u7075\u7684\u611f\u89c9\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u7535\u5f71\u5c0f\u8bf4\u90fd\u4f1a\u5f3a\u8c03\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e1c\u897f\u5728\u8fd9\u90e8\u5206\u6709\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u5171\u9e23\u611f\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u52a8\u753b\u4e00\u822c\u76f4\u89c2\u800c\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7acb\u7ed8\u6f14\u51fa\u770b\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u75db\u5feb\u3002\n\u968f\u7740\u611f\u5b98\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u7684\u5267\u60c5\u9ad8\u6f6e\u7684\u7ed3\u675f\uff0c\u6545\u4e8b\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u624d\u6446\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u9762\u524d\uff0c\u5982\u540c\u7ed3\u5c3e\u526f\u6807\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u770b\u7740Extra\u7bc7\u7684\u5404\u4e2a\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u53d7\u5230\u4e16\u754c\u7ebf\u6ce2\u53ca\u4e5f\u597d\u8fd8\u662f\u65e2\u5b9a\u767b\u573a\u4e5f\u7f62\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5728\u5f00\u7537\u4e3b\u73a9\u7b11\uff0c\u56de\u60f3\u8d77\u6545\u4e8b\u7684\u70b9\u70b9\u6ef4\u6ef4\uff0c\u60f3\u5230\u90a3\u4e9b\u65e0\u8bba\u5728\u4ec0\u4e48\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u90fd\u5728\u60f3\u7740\u4f60\u7684\u4eba\uff1b\u65e0\u8bba\u5728\u600e\u6837\u7684\u73af\u5883\u6210\u957f\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u4f60\u7684\u4eba\uff1b\u65e0\u8bba\u9762\u4e34\u4ec0\u4e48\u6837\u7684\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4f9d\u7136\u966a\u5728\u4f60\u8eab\u8fb9\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u660e\u767d\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u90fd\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u201c\u771f\u7231\u201d\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1513091996, "timestamp_updated": 1513091996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38251622": {"recommendationid": "38251622", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992847598", "num_games_owned": 444, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512786000}, "language": "english", "review": "There is a reason this game is considered one of the best visual novels of all time.

Do you like stories of war, science fiction, and philosophical dilemnas over your own humanity and intrinsic worth in the face of the universe? Even if you don't, play this game. It is full of quandries, both fantastical and solidified in our current reality; perhaps even some we or our succesors will have to answer for themselves in the face of ever accelerating technological advances.\nThis triology may have started off as a simplistic story about developing a romantic relationship with 5 [spoiler](or 6?)[/spoiler] lovely girls, but has evolved into so much more that it is one of those games that transcends gender and cultural divides. It is a game every person should play before they die; if not for the life lessons, then for the journey.", "timestamp_created": 1511820252, "timestamp_updated": 1511820252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595402", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37778796": {"recommendationid": "37778796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002540536", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511787338}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u3044\u308f\u3086\u308b\u795e\u30b2\u30fc\u3067\u3042\u308b", "timestamp_created": 1511788097, "timestamp_updated": 1511788404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37755940": {"recommendationid": "37755940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090740222", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507280420}, "language": "english", "review": "While this one is more linear than the last, the story is amazing and will last 50+ hours.

The story overall will stay the same. I don't think that's much of a bad thing, Muv-Luv EXTRA has ya covered for choices, Unlimited has it to a lesser extent.

I came in expecting it to be good but did not expect it to be [i]this[/i] good.\n\nBelieve the hype. This is the real deal.\n\nIf you're into mecha/military sci-fi and don't mind a bit of anime fluff, Muv-Luv Alternative offers one of the most compelling storylines I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. \n\nThe world setting is bleak and is presented in a somewhat realistic (anime) manner that's both believable and interesting.\n\nThough categorically, I'd rate the sci-fi elements to be a bit light but the writer for this scenario did an amazing job in tying in a lot of elements together while remaining logical and coherent to the main over-arching plot. Everything presented in the story has its place in the world and never at anytime did I feel that it was just tacked on just to fulfill a demographic need.\n\nThe cast of characters in this world are of course based on typical anime tropes but do have their individual reasons for behaving the way they are. Though their characterizations are not deep but their beliefs and motivations are belivable (as with how anime characters are). There were some stand out characters (Meiya, Yuuko, Marimo, Isumi) but overall, they all complement each other very well.\n\nAs with any good book, the story does take a bit time to to ramp up but when it does it does not let up. The story presented here is complete and ends with a great feeling that we too, as the reader, has experienced all the bitterness, hardships and the fleeting moments of happiness that main protagonist has felt, throughout his journey through this nightmarish world he finds himself in.\n\nThere is a great sense of flow, in which each section builds upon the previous parts of the narrative, propelling the story further with great urgency. \n\nI was especially impressed with the way battles were presented, which felt very dynamic and exciting, especially when most of the action is presented using moving drawn stills and camera effects (zooms, pans, filters, etc.).\n\nThe few negatives I have about this title is how much I didn't want the story to end. Also there were some pacing issues near the end but it did not detract from the overall epic ending that it successfully conveyed.

Takeru is unlike idealists, depected in many fic or animation, who own perfect trait being philathropic, brave and kind, whenever and wherever they are, Takeru is trully realists who know that what they should do even including dirty work and sacrificing for good purpose, and hence sacrifices himself and become matual officer. And Yes, he is unperfect human like any humans, it only make him become attractive hero. Besides, This game is about how one simple officer become paradigm of officer,and since I grew up in military base and still now live in officer dormitary, it is not difficult for me fastly like this character. He knows that he is one of the armies at first and is human at second; albeit, being human at second doesn't mean rejecting being human and he keep this balance well after the battle in Sadoshima. such status in contradictory just like other thing depicted in MUV-LUV is no more than conflict between consciousness of nation with unifying destiny of human, MUV-LUV accomodates them all well. \nThe one of two thing I hate is why I can\u2019t pick up my lover, go the hell the age, I want Meiya.

I'm told it's one of the best ones and it does a lot of... interesting stuff with that whole concept. If you're like me and indifferent to that but thinking about getting these two games for the mecha aspect, that's where it becomes really difficult to recommend. That part has a tendency to fall into the background for more than a few hours at a time once you finally get to it (takes about fifteen hours if i remember correctly), and if I'm being honest that's a good thing since it maybe wouldn't be able to carry your interest on it's own even if you're already a fan of the genre.\n\nNot necessarily a knock on the game itself, I just came into it with the wrong expectations. This is very much an eroge visual novel about a ton of girls orbitting one oblivious dude's crotch, even if it does eventually involve giant robots and aliens and other sci-fi stuff. And if the former is your thing, again, this is almost certainly for you. But if you're just curious about the one super hyped up mecha visual novel you'll probably want to save yourself the time and money. While the mecha aspect definitely sees a huge jump in quality once you get to Alternative, you're talking about over 20 hours minimum to get there (I used a walkthrough), and even then it takes it's sweet time getting to (no spoilers) the parts you've actually wanted to see since halfway through the previous game, and would only stand up to average/slightly above average mecha anime or manga.", "timestamp_created": 1510691379, "timestamp_updated": 1510692348, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.256877", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36489541": {"recommendationid": "36489541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061917032", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 3040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1514077439}, "language": "english", "review": "Likely one of the best VNs you can get.

The titanic human-BETA struggle depicted in this story will awe you with its scale, and the steeled resolve and determination it demands from its soldiers.\n\nYou will laugh, grow, rage, despair and cry along with the protagonist's journey, the immersion you feel will make the 40 hour read pass like a breeze.\n\nOn the other front, MLA has an extremely high production value, from the moving and dynamic sprites allowing simulation of action scenes, to the HUD interfaces that make you feel like being in a mech, to the orchestral music that pumps with tension and grandeur.\n\nThe military side of the story also bustles with tremendous realism. The battles in Muv-Luv are not about the hero wiping out the enemies which is so typical in other stories, the battles in Muv Luv alternative are massive military campaigns, with intricate planning and co-operation across many military branches, with the dynamism and unpredictability you would expect from an actual warfare.\n\nIf you like any of those things, buy the two games and read them, it will be an unforgettable experience.

It's not really the most original concept in the world but it is probably the best it's ever been executed. Unfortunately MLA is a pretty hard sell for a lot of people since its predecessor (Muv Luv) can feel pretty sluggish, and is absolutely required in order to get the full experience that Alternative has to offer. If you can't sit through 15ish hours of exposition, you might want to look in another direction. But needless to say, if you're still on board by the time you get to Alternative, you won't be disappointed. This is the #1 rated VN of all time for a damn good reason, and it deserves to be far more popular than it actually is. If you're even a little bit curious, just take the leap. MLA isn't just good on its own--it even goes back and makes Extra/Unlimited better than they initially were, which adds to their replay values as well.\n\nYou know that part of the description that says, \"Common side effects include... unrealistic expectations for any and all other visual novels\"? \n\nIt's accurate.\n\nSidenote: if you complete and enjoy Alternative, look into the Altered Fable fandisc as well, which includes a turn based, tactical SRPG kinda game set in the universe of Alternative. It's a lot of fun if you spend 30-60 minutes to figure it all out, and it has a lot of heart put into its design to keep everything as true to the source material as possible. Here's to hoping that Degica and Age can translate and bring all the fandiscs over here sooner than later.", "timestamp_created": 1509519049, "timestamp_updated": 1509519442, "voted_up": true,

Honestly, explaining any of the story would be a major spoiler, so I'll start with this: you must complete muv-luv extra, and muv-luv unlimited to get the full impact of this story, the more routes you do in happy happy joy joy land the more this will make sense in the long run....\n\nThat said, my god, where muv-luv was a 7/10 romcom of kek proportions, this is a 10/10 masterpiece, and the best visual novel I have ever read (previously being Steins;Gate)... Don't just take it from me, it's also the #1 VN on VNDB [basically the myanimelist for VN's] skirting above steins;gate (and only two vn's in existence have a score above 9, you can count 8's on 1 page too,) so that score is truly meaningful.\n\nI really don't want to delve into any specifics, not even the first minutes of the game, because even the starting moment of this game is a huge surprise... And it just never stops, non stop forward-moving narrative ensures there's never a dull moment... I was truly enthralled by every moment in here, it doesn't feel like there was much of any wasted time/filler(aside from a few flashbacks that might happen way too often, honestly my only gripe,) the way it incorporates the elements from the prequels is done in a way to make all the buildup incredibly worth it, and the end experience of the whole package is astounding. \n\nIf you ever have 100~ hours to commit, and you're okay with a b movie romcom start (again, I'd rate 7/10... To me, that's good. good enough to get through it and I enjoyed it, unlimited is definitely a lot better in that regard, probably give that 8/10, I'd recommend them on their own to people who are alright with slightly whacky slice of life/[spoiler]isekai[/spoiler] genre and what not, but probably not to any random joe.) then you ABSOLUTELY have to give this a try! All that time spent in extra/unlimited will feel well worth the investment once you reach the starting moments of alternative, and it never stops giving til the very last moment.\n\n\n\nOn another note, If you can't handle [spoiler]incredibly stressful depression/gore/ptsd inducing moments, and you just want to end with the happy feelings of the original, you may actually want to stray away from this.

d'une claque. Gardez cette image en t\u00eate, et dites vous qu'avec Muv-Luv Alternative, c'est plut\u00f4t de l'ordre du semi remorque qui vous roule dessus (plusieurs fois).\n\nPremi\u00e8re chose, c'est je pense tr\u00e8s important de jouer aux deux opus pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, Muv-Luv Extra et Unlimited. Le principal int\u00e9r\u00eat est l'attachement aux personnages. Ca peut para\u00eetre secondaire (surtout quand on connait peu les visuals novels), mais cela risque de faire toute la diff\u00e9rence entre une bonne exp\u00e9rience et une exp\u00e9rience m\u00e9morable, puisque les personnages sont un des tr\u00e8s gros point fort de ce VN. Les filles de l'unit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part, Yuuko Sensei, Marimo, Kasumi, Tsukuyomi, le h\u00e9ros principal et l'unit\u00e9 A01 sont tous tr\u00e8s bien construits et donnent vraiment envie de voir la suite.\n\nJ'en dirais peu sur l'histoire, car c'est vraiment dur de l'\u00e9voquer sans vraiment tout spoiler, mais c'est un autre point fort d'Alternative. En toute franchise, en ayant lu Extra et Unlimited, je ne m'attendais pas du tout \u00e0 une histoire aussi aboutie. Et m\u00eame si j'ai bien aim\u00e9 les deux, Alternative est vraiment d'un tout autre niveau. En plus, j'ai vraiment ador\u00e9 l'immersion, tout est fait pour qu'on se prenne pour Takeru et \u00e7a fonctionne terriblement bien. La bande son aussi est tr\u00e8s bien faite, ce n'est pas la meilleur de l'histoire de l'humanit\u00e9 mais certaines BGM sont vraiment g\u00e9niales (War Preparation, For You Who Departs / Destiny, Storm Vanguard, Flame of Life pour ne citer que celles-ci).\n\nEnsuite, pour ceux qui se poserait la question, le fait que les sc\u00e8nes \"ol\u00e9 ol\u00e9\" ne soient pas pr\u00e9sentes dans cette version ne change pas grand chose \u00e0 l'exp\u00e9rience, car contrairement \u00e0 certaines traductions censur\u00e9s faites n'importe comment (coucou If My Heart Had Wings), ici les traducteurs ont fait un excellent travail et rien n'est enlev\u00e9 \u00e0 l'histoire. Apr\u00e8s il faut savoir comprendre l'anglais, \u00e9videmment, et c'est pas donn\u00e9 \u00e0 tout le monde.\n\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, un VN juste g\u00e9nial, r\u00e9ussi sur quasiment tout les aspects et s\u00fbrement l'un des meilleurs disponible sur steam actuellement ; l'un des meilleurs tout court en fait.\n\n\nPour ceux qui aiment bien chercher la petite b\u00eate, j'ai list\u00e9 quelques points n\u00e9gatifs. Apr\u00e8s faut garder \u00e0 l'esprit que c'est de l'ordre du d\u00e9tail :\n_ les visuels datent un peu et la r\u00e9solution n'est pas tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9e, compr\u00e9hensible vu la date originale de sortie (2006).\n_ je sais que \u00e7a peut en d\u00e9ranger certains de voir des personnages avec des coiffures wtf en pleine guerre contre des extraterrestres, mais bon en vrai on n'y fait plus attention assez vite et ce n'est pas choquant quand on connait un minimum les mangas, animes, etc.\n_ certaines longueurs lors des phases plus calmes de l'histoire peuvent l\u00e0 aussi en g\u00eaner quelques-uns. J'ai personnellement ador\u00e9, mais c'est vrai que Takeru parle et r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi beaucoup.\n_ une fois le jeu termin\u00e9, il n'est pas possible d'\u00e9couter \u00e0 nouveau les BGMs, assez \u00e9trange vu que c'\u00e9tait possible dans Extra et Unlimited.\n_ ATTENTION SPOIL [spoiler] Le fait que l'histoire soit lin\u00e9aire, sans choix vraiment important m'a un poil d\u00e9\u00e7u, \u00e9tant fan du personnage de Meiya. Sumika est vraiment la fille qui compte le plus ici. C'est justifi\u00e9 par toute l'intrigue en elle-m\u00eame et donc c'est plut\u00f4t logique, mais \u00e7a m'a quelques fois fait perdre en immersion en ayant trop Unlimited en t\u00eate.

For me, what makes a good story are good characters, and every single one of those characters in Muv-Luv are memorable, sometimes i felt like a father figure seeing your children growing up to become a adult, every character mature, they still have flaws, but seeing everyone change to the point of you not recognize what they were in Extra, this is a good writting, you think you know what is going to happen, and you probably are going to be right on the money, but you'll never expect how things going to happen. \n\nAs i see with a critic perspective, have to say, i think this is one of, if not the best VN of all time, and i can say for sure it is better then every single game story out there these days, it gives valuable lessons that we overlook in our life, what we take for granted, what we fight for as human beings, and what maturing actually means, what needs to be done, those are questions that i'll carry through my life thanks to this VN, as well as every character and mainly Takeru, as i mention earlier, it is like a father seeing his children growing up, you see his hardship, his low moments, he is just a human being besides being what he is, and i think that's why he is so commendable, every time he felt, i felt as well, every time he was happy i was, when he did something great i was proud of him, it is so weird that a game that is basically text, audio and images can make you feel spectrum of feelings. \n\nAt the end of the day, Muv-Luv Alternative is right beside Clannad in my heart, i'll never forget what they teached me, the moments, the characters, the music, everything, the action scenes you want to throw your table through the window just for the insane hype, the horror moments and traumatizing moments my blood ran cold, the heart felt moments i just felt as it was one of my own, there is a reason why therapy is not included, because i'm traumatize for life. \n\nIn the silver blossom of a cherry tree \nDwells a brave and loyal soul \nRooting itself firmly in Earth \nIt dreams no longer of the sky \n\nThank you Isumi's Valkyrie o7", "timestamp_created": 1507475236, "timestamp_updated": 1507475329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613064", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35551068": {"recommendationid": "35551068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044112571", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507466698}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u9664\u4e86\u725b\u903c\u6211\u8fd8\u80fd\u8bf4\u4ec0\u4e48\u5462\nWAR IS HELL\uff0c\u73cd\u60dc\u548c\u5e73\uff0c\u8b66\u60d5\u6218\u4e89\n\u987a\u4fbf\u4e00\u8bf4\u6700\u540e\u7684\u7cd6\u597d\u751c", "timestamp_created": 1507398839, "timestamp_updated": 1507398839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35525625": {"recommendationid": "35525625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089709802", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513442519}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u795e\u4f5c\n\u4e00\u73a9\u4e0b\u53bb\u5c31\u6b32\u7f77\u4e0d\u80fd\n\u5c24\u5176\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5f8c\u7684\u4f5c\u6230", "timestamp_created": 1507317076, "timestamp_updated": 1507317076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35511620": {"recommendationid": "35511620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014389865", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512179106}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most heart feeling novel out there. This game will break you and just when you think you could handle it you don't.By far Muv-Luv Series is my first and probably not my last. So much information in this game is mind-blowing the things the main character goes through, and I even had theories from the start first time I finish the first game multiple times in different endings shows what has been happening throughout the whole time. Also at the End of the novel no matter how hard I tried I teared up in the end to be, I couldn't help but tear up a bit at how much Takeru and I have been through this who series I was at peace when I saw this ending. All in all, I highly recommend this Novel and pray to god they decide to put Muv-Luv Altered Fables on here, and it was \"originally\" A non-canon fan-disc, but the creator was like \"heh what the hell it's canon now.\" A little detail  of what I know on Altered Fables is that its suppose to take place after this game and I don't want to say too much as it will ruin the novel for a lot of people just found on your own. \n\n\n***SPOILER ALERT***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing I found most Interesting was the Parallel Universes Thing.

If you could rewind back time to change that, how far would you be willing to go? How much could you give up?\n\nThe time for fun and games is over, you now have your final chance, but fair warning. War was never meant for the weak of heart. Once you start there is no turning back.\n\nReview Start: the paragraph above best describes how I would introduce someone to MLA, you see people say this VN is a masterpiece , the best but also always see PTSD, pain train, depression and the like. The two are one and the same thing, this game is not for the weak of heart we got extra and unlimited for that. You loved the characters in Muvluv? Good! You love the TSFs? Great! Felt weird not seeing the gravity of the situation? Well steel you resolve soldier. Now you go for a REAL war that you wanted since unlimited but unlike other games you dont have plot armor to save you. The only game that punishes dedication and attachment to characters. Where you will feel what a real war is, you are but a single soldier, you honestly believe a protagonist can go hero and overturn a war? Well good luck and see if you can. That experience is what the MLA trilogy is all about.\n\nWith a compelling narative and engaginng story, experience what the hype is all about. The VN that raised over a million dollars that fact alone describes how much people love this game. My self included. You can believe we are crazy, you can believe you are superior for not following the hype. But this game would not have the love and support it has without being able to touch so many lives.\n\nRecommend this to anyone feeling that you are insignificant and weak, powerless or depressed. This game would show you the finest and ugliest traits of humanity and make you believe that there are things worth dying for.\n\nPS, this aint no game, no amount of yelling about doing you best would save you, no amount of belief can overturn the beta.

You might miss out on the so called nostalgia or hidden premonition effects, but if you don't like Extra anyway (like me), it actually makes Alternative much worse in some parts if you had to force yourself through Extra by adding some negative emotional baggage and therefore just outright rejecting some story parts and developments in Alternative. As I don't want to spoiler, I won't go into detail there. I've made the mistake to force myself through one route in Extra believing it would make it better in retrospect. I was wrong... I am absolutely sure I would've enjoyed Alternative far more if not for those negative memories of browsing though the, pardon me, retarded world of Extra, of which you get reminded of in Alternative as the story progresses. \n\nYou might ask yourself why I don't really touch on Unlimited here. The reason is, that Alternatives storyline has far more Interaction with Extra, and therefore bad memories of Extra don't surface much through Unlimited, but do it with a bang when you hit Alternative. \n\nIf you don't like Extra after about an hour of reading, just stop and move on to Unlimited. \nYou have been warned...", "timestamp_created": 1506356418, "timestamp_updated": 1506356418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35203005": {"recommendationid": "35203005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134115652", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3829, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512890975}, "language": "schinese", "review": "I played this game before, make payment on steam to support developer and thanks for the Chinese version.\n\nThis is the best visual novel,science fiction on PC. \n\n\u4e8c\u5237\uff0c\u5b98\u65b9\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u8981\u652f\u6301\u4e00\u4e0b\u3002\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u6218\u4e89\u79d1\u5e7bgalgame", "timestamp_created": 1506346884, "timestamp_updated": 1506346884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35202727": {"recommendationid": "35202727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198370629183", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 47, "last_played": 1514371522}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u672c\u547d\u4f5c\uff0c\u8865\u7968\uff0c[spoiler]\u6211\u6c38\u8fdc\u559c\u6b22\u767d\u94f6\u6b66[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1506345960, "timestamp_updated": 1513157735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35200150": {"recommendationid": "35200150", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976543691", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506346261}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all, first thing I will say about this game is:\n\nThis review is spoiler free and DONT READ ANYTHING ABOUT THIS GAME, OR MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE ANYTHING YOU READ IS SPOILER FREE. If you think \"Naaah, it can't that bad, I've been spoiled before, im used to it\" Let me you tell you this, if you screw this up, you WILL regret it so much when the moment comes. My friend almost murdered me for spoiling it for him after I experienced that scene and had to tell others about it. I've regretted it ever since. This game is a shining gold nugget that you DO NOT WANT TO DIM\n\nThere is one scene which will give you an experience which you will never experience again in your life time and if you ruin it, you WILL regret it so much that you honestly want to go back in time and hit yourself for not being careful in the internet.\n\nNow onto the review.\n\nIt's the best of the english translated Visual novels right now and I mean THE BEST. It's been at the top of VNDB most rated and popular visual novels since... I started reading visual novels ten years ago? Anyway, a long time\n\nHow to say it shortly... This game delves into the original Muv Luv's Unlimited story ark world, so it's huge plus if you've read the previous title, as you will understand more about the world you're plunged into. Visual novel is centered around alternative telling of our world and its post apocalyptic world and the problems that rise from it. If you've read the previous title Unlimited story ark you can probably surmise that this is a far cry from the love comedy genre that original Muv Luv was.\n\nIm not going to tell you anything more than that, because well... You really have to experience it yourself.\n\nNow then this story has incredible soundtrack, story, characters, drama, character development, lore, voice actors, world politics. I honestly cannot think any \"bad\" things about this game. It's just so good that you just either don't notice them or that there isn't any.\n\nOnly \"bad\" thing about this game is that it's LONG and I mean LOOOOONG. It took me a WEEK (probably longer, I can't remember) to read the damn thing (I can't remember clearly but I think I read atleast 4-8 hours a day, give or take some breaks doing something else) and during that week, I felt like I was in HIIIIGH heaven. Probably exaggeration but one thing is for sure, this visual novel will break your mind.\n\nFor me, a visual novel being long is a good thing if the reading is exciting and captivating. For some people it's bad a thing, they probably want to do something else than spend whole day reading a book you cannot stop reading. This visual novel is one of the rare visual novel's that keep surprising you with \"It didn't end here? It's still going on? HELL YEAH\" and when you're finally at the end you feel drained and depressed that the thing you've read has ended.\n\nSo to close this all up.\n\nMake absolutely sure not to spoil yourself about this game and prepare a LOT of time to read this, preferable alone at some summer cottage during weekends in middle of nowhere where noone can disturb you.", "timestamp_created": 1506335765, "timestamp_updated": 1506336567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527638", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35199457": {"recommendationid": "35199457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001239809", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506233399}, "language": "english", "review": "I have now played through this visual novel 3 times, and I still manage to laugh and cry as much as the first time I read it. The story covers so many different topics that I don't think it's possible to really put it into a genre. As much as people will tell you that you need to read the first ones, I've already lost so many potential readers to the monotony of the first two games. But as almost every person that has gone through the journey of the three games will tell you, the payoff is insanely worth it. It's got more action, strategic tension, and plot twists than Code Geass. The characters and the world that you're thrust into contain personality, grit, and lore that simply can't be found in anime with time and dialogue constraints. But the visual novel also never forgets to make you laugh and make connections with the people struggling with you. At the risk of sounding like a complete tool, I think Muv Luv Alternative has the best story that any Japanese medium has to offer. \n\nThe new translation is an improvement off the fan translation overall, and many of the physics concepts that are explained throughout the novel are easier to understand as a result. Sex scenes still exist in this version, with the images zoomed in and edited to avoid showing any nudity. I do not imagine that this will impact the experience of many readers. Only the most explicit of dialogue is cut, and Sekai Project clearly made an effort to stay faithful to the original as much as possible with the limitations of Steam. Also, English vocals are thankfully much improved from the original. As such, I don't think it's necessary to go through the trouble of patching the game to 18+. \n\nThe production values on this visual novel are incredible in some aspects, and mediocre in others. Many people do not like the art style of the characters, but the animation quality of the action sequences and the broad set of facial expressions that come with the art style more than make up for it for me.\n\nI'm going to be one of the dissenting opinions and tell you that if you have a history of dropping shows after the first few episodes bore you, then maybe you should just skip straight to Muv-Luv Unlimited. This will severely degrade the experience, but even this degraded experience is amazing by itself, and most of the foreshadowing and flashbacks in Alternative refer to Muv-Luv Unlimited. Though Muv-Luv Extra and Unlimited combined are shorter than Alternative, this doesn't change the fact that Extra by itself can take 15-20 hours of your time, and is notoriously generic and boring for those seeking a strong story and tension. \n\nI'm bad at conclusions.", "timestamp_created": 1506332273, "timestamp_updated": 1506332273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35197489": {"recommendationid": "35197489", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971909597", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506319953}, "language": "english", "review": "I had very mixed feelings about both backing and playing Muv-Luv, especially Alternative.

Most off-putting of all is probably the asking price, although I got over thirty-five hours out of it, and despite it hardly being interactive at all, that time was compelling enough that it kept me going until the early hours of the morning sometimes.\n\nDespite those hangups I really can't recommend this highly enough, this entire story was just a remarkable ride.", "timestamp_created": 1506301569, "timestamp_updated": 1506301569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35192642": {"recommendationid": "35192642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137660052", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507456798}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e70\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ec0\u4e48\u7406\u7531\u4e48\n-------------------------------------\n\n\u4eca\u5929\u5df2\u7ecf\u662f\u6253\u5b8c\u8fd9\u90e8\u4f5c\u54c1\u7684\u4e24\u4e09\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\u4e86\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u73b0\u5728\u8fd8\u6709\u65e0\u6570\u8ba9\u4eba\u611f\u52a8\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u6d6e\u73b0\u5728\u773c\u524d\u3002\u8fd9\u90e8\u4f5c\u54c1\u6709\u591a\u5f3a\u5c31\u4e0d\u9700\u591a\u8bf4\u4e86\uff0c\u5f53\u7136\u6211\u8fd8\u662f\u8981\u5439\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u90e8\u65e0\u654c\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\u3002\n\n\u771f\u7684\u633a\u60f3\u5199\u5f88\u591a\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u600e\u4e48\u8bf4\uff0c\u90fd\u4e0d\u592a\u597d\u8868\u8fbe\u51fa\u6765\u3002\u6700\u60f3\u8bf4\u7684\u5c31\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u4eba\u751f\u4e2d\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u5207\u5b9e\u4f53\u4f1a\u5230\u548c\u5e73\u7684\u7f8e\u597d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9muv\u6240\u642d\u5efa\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4e0d\u820d\u3002[spoiler] \u6211\u751a\u81f3\u8fd8\u5e0c\u671b\u4e13\u95e8\u51fa\u4e00\u90e8gal\uff0c\u8bb2\u7537\u4e3b\u53bb\u4e86\u548c\u5e73\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u4e4b\u540e\u548c\u5927\u5bb6\u7684\u540e\u5bab\u6545\u4e8b\u3002[/spoiler] \u5728\u6700\u540e\u7537\u4e3b\u62ef\u6551\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\uff0c\u54e6\u8fd9\u4e48\u8bf4\u4e0d\u592a\u4e25\u8c28\uff0c\u81f3\u5c11\u62ef\u6551\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u548c\u7eaf\u590f\uff0c\u8fce\u6765\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u5e94\u6709\u7684\u7ed3\u5c40\u3002\u771f\u7684\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u8ba9\u4eba\u611f\u52a8\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u5927\u5bb6\u90fd\u73a9\uff0c\u90fd\u4e70\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1506294893, "timestamp_updated": 1511936777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35184872": {"recommendationid": "35184872", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994218299", "num_games_owned": 532, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508381235}, "language": "english", "review": "Welcome to the pain train.

I laughed.  I sobbed uncontrollably.  And I eagerly awaited this sequel.\n\nMuv-Luv Alternative loops time again after the end of Ultimate bringing closure to the events in the Ultimate time-line and answering many of the things that were left unexplained and mysterious:  Where is Sumika?  What's the deal with Alternative IV?  Who is and what is the deal with Kasumi?  Will Takeru ever grow up?  How can you have so little mecha action in a story about mecha?\n\nThis visual novel is considerably more linear than even Ultimate which might put you off if you are expecting gameplay, but that is not the point of a visual novel.  The story is long, satisfying, profoundly upsetting and occasionally horrifying.  If you like mecha, there's a heck of a lot of mecha.  By the end you will feel the wear and the strain of the campaign.  You will mourn friends lost.  You may still... hate Takeru, but trust me you will love everyone else.\n\nThis visual novel has been a truly incredible use of 29 hours of my life.

This game completely erases the tones set up in the previous two games in the series, Muv Luv and Muv Luv Extra. The original Muv Luv, as you should know by now, was more like your typical dating sim visual novel, where a good majority of the girls are attracted to you and you have the choice of dating whichever one you choose. Extra took this a bit further, and added a more deep tone to it, while having that dating sim aspect still present. But then you have this game. Muv Luv Alternative. They took the design of the other two novels and literally threw them out of the TSF straight into the mouths of a Fort-class BETA. The carefree attitude of the MC Shirogane Takeru is annihilated, as he suffers similarly to Okabe Rintarou in Steins;Gate. The suffering never ends, and you get dragged through the mud and blood right along with Takeru as he stumbles and falls, but also while he learns to accept reality and face what he's been running away from this whole time. Of course, this is already along the lines of being spoiler, so I'll leave it at that.\n\nThis game in particular completely threw me off. I was expecting to be able to have some fun and lighthearted adventures as Takeru comes back for his 3rd installment in the series. Of course, if you read the store description, you immediately know that something went very wrong this time around. You have to watch the suffering, watch the pain and despair, and you can't do anything to help as you are merely the observer. It's painful. It may give you borderline PTSD for a while. Every happy moment seems like it could very well break any moment, it's actually rather stressful as well. You get enveloped in the chaotic world of humans being at war with the aliens known as BETA and it pulls your attention even stronger the deeper you dive into it. The science is real, the reality is actually rather realistic. There's no magical powers, no plot armor. Every threat is real, nobody is safe. That's war. The tech is more advanced sure, but you get explanations for nearly everything that is used, and it all makes sense. This visual novel is Legendary. Truly God-tier. You do need to walk through the first two games to get that deeper connection with the characters, but it's worth it. Play this game, you seriously need to experience this story.

People usually portray girls as weakling who should be protected and saved in war, but in this game, the girls are the one doing the protecting.\n\nPeople might say this is a sad story, but you can think whatever. To me, this is a story about growing up. From the happy-go-lucky life in original Muv-Luv, suddenly everything changes and you are forced to face so many things to the breaking point. From each arc, each dialogue with all the characters I learned how small my problems were, I learned how to deal with my emotions, I learned how to endure, and how to give my best effort to face adversity. To know that I'm not the only one with issues, to know that everyone is struggling far worse and they manage to stay strong, I realized that I need to move forward too.

That is honestly the only word I know to describe this game. Before I begin my review I'd just like to say; on the off chance any developers or translators read this review, thank you for this series.\n\nOk so in to my review.\n\n1st. If you have not played both Muv-Luv & Extra you WILL miss out on a great deal of the emotion this game has to offer. Both Muv-Luv & Extra are tiad very heavily to this game. Be aware however that Muv-Luv is very different from Extra & Alternative, yet it's story is intertwined with both.\n\n2nd. The story in this game is amazing! I'm not going to go into detail because I truly believe it's best to go into this game with only the knowledge of the previous 2 games. I will say that the story is very long but doesn't feel slow.

As far as VNs go, MLA is just, well, really really long. It's about as long as all 3 F/SN routes combined for comparison to other visual novels - it will probably take the average user around 60 hours minimum to read it. So why invest all that time in it? Because it's worth it. MLA is [b]the best[/b] visual novel I have read to date. Somehow against all odds, a crappy generic school harem spun off into an amazing apocalyptic sci-fi story.  It's a story filled with violence, despair, and sacrifice but the core theme of not giving up no matter how dark it looks for the hope of a better tomorrow is stong throughout, and to see the character's journey to completion is an experience I will never forget. \n\nHowever not every diamond is without its flaws. Alternative's comes in the form of its predecessors, Extra and Unlimited. These... aren't great. Extra is a generic school harem as previously mentioned, and while Unlimited is the source of the spinoff that Alternative follows up, it was kind of mediocre. If MLA is a 10, E and U would be a 5 and 6 repsectively. Now, as much as I'd like to say \"you can just skip them\", for a story like this you can't. The main routes of E and just one playthrough of U are required - I would in no way suggest just reading a synopsis for it. So that's probably 10-15 hours of time you'll have to invest into something not really that good to get to something amazing.

Muv Luv Alternative is one of the greatest visual novels I've ever read.\" - Majikoi (MH) 2018\n\nDISCLAIMER: I have personally backed this game on Kickstarter. This is my 2nd review on Steam and will be spoiler free and be more like my ramblings and praise for the series. I have read the visual novel before the release on Steam.\n\nCritically acclaimed by fans and rated #1 on the VNDB. Muv Luv Alternative (pronounced \"Mabu Ravu\") was released in 2006, 3 years after the release of Muv Luv Extra/Unlimited. Alternative is the final game in the original Muv Luv Trilogy. Completing the story of Shirogane Takeru. A story of \"Love and Courage\". \n\nDespite being linear in format, Alternative has a very strong narrative and impressive world building. The first part of the story begins similarly to the start of Unlimited. As the story progresses things start to change dramatically as Takeru's decisions change the world and the future. Elements  such as plot twists, politics, moral/ethical dilenmas litter the 1st half of the story. It is much more grounding and purposeful compared to Unlimited and it finally gives value to a lot of the generic story elements in the first two games.\n\nThe 2nd part of the story is where Alternative takes off. And boy, does it take off. Exponentially. The first time I had read it, I went on a 48 hour binge reading spree to complete it. A very emotional, dramatic and powerful experience you only get in a very few selection of visual novels.\n\nAlternative is really a story of sacrifice with love and courage in the mix. Some fans of the series would argue that throughout the later half of the story, Takerus struggles and situations lead him a journery where he grows from a boy to a man. However, I would have to disagree, rather his journey is one where a boy becomes soldier. Dealing with the harsh realities of war in world very different from our own but also very similar. Despite that, it reminds us that there is still hope.\n\nOverall I greatly enjoyed it and is one experience that I probably won't ever forget. I highly reccommend it to anyone that is a fan of science fiction / romance / drama.\n\n\"Carry out your mission at all costs!\nFight till your very last breath!\nMake your death count!\"\n\n\nBONUS CANADIAN BREAKFAST FOOD REVIEW:\n\nExtra = Uncooked Buttermilk Pancake Batter\n\nMuv Luv Extra is like uncooked pancake batter. Under extreme circumstances, one may consume it raw it if absolutely necessary. Overall, bland and almost unpalatable, but not inedible if you are in a post apocalyptic survival situation.\n\nUnlimited = Hot Non-Stick Skillet\n\nMuv Luv Unlimited is the foundation of Muv Luv and many of its side stories and spinoffs. An absolute and necessary tool for the introduction to the alternative universe of the Muv Luv franchise. Without it, one must consume their foodstuffs raw. When combined with Extra, you get a fluffy, warm, and soft buttermilk pancake. Still bland, but much more palatable.\n\nAlternative = 100% Authentic Real Canadian Grade \u201cA\u201d Maple Syrup\n\n\u201cOne cannot have said to have tasted the \u201cTRUE\u201d essence of breakfast pancakes without having it with real Canadian maple syrup...\u201d - Some random Canadian gentleman I happened to interview one day on the street... \n\nMuv Luv Alternative is like maple syrup. It is the final game in the trilogy and completes the main series in its entirety. Golden and delicious, the naturally sweet syrup when combined with your warm buttermilk pancakes (Extra + Unlimited) completes your amazing morning breakfast. Each mouthful tantalizes your tongue and taste buds. You can't stop and find yourself having breakfast pancakes every morning. Soon you get fat. Your friends tease and bully you. Your mother shames you. Your doctor tells you that you have type 2 diabetes! You later discover that maple syrup is a very poor source of nutrients and very high in sugar/calories. Every drop adds to your waistline... But you don't regret it. Yes. You don't regret it at all.\n\nSide Stories and Spin offs (in Photon Flowers/Melodies, etc) \n= Pancake toppings such as blueberries, apples, jam, chocolate, butter, nuts, etc.\n\nWhen different toppings are added to your pancake breakfast, it makes each meal unique and enhances the flavor and experience.\n\nThe Day After, Total Eclipse, Schwarzesmarken, Altered Fable, etc (Major Side Stories)\n = Bacon, Eggs, Sausage, Ham, and/or Hash Browns.\n\nMajor side stories such as The Day After, Total Eclipse, Schwarzesmarken are other delicous breakfast items, that when added to your pancake meal creates a complete and balanced \"Breakfast of Champions\".", "timestamp_created": 1505966189, "timestamp_updated": 1506011645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 7,

Chronicles, Haruko Maniax etc.\n\nThe conclusion to what is basically the longest single sci-fi visual novel written with Extra and Unlimited basically being both an extremely long prologue and world building chapters. Alternative builds on everything introduced in the two previous installments and then dials it up to eleven. All the character building, all the world building, all those odd little moments that sort of didn't make sense in the context they were presented, ALL of it is relevant so if you enjoyed those aspects and they piqued your interest then you are going to love Alternative.\n\nThis version is also far more polished than the fan translated version. While the translation was good in the fan version, it felt a little sterile and didn't quite capture each characters various methods of speech, especially Tsukuyomi, Meiya and Takeru. The images were also only partially translated but that was mostly down to the limitations of the tools used to extract and modify the images, seeing them fully translated though really makes a difference. This version also includes more voice lines for Takeru and additional scenes that weren't included in the initial PC release (I believe this is a port of MuvLuv Alternative Winows 7 edition) so even for people like myself who have read it several times and have seen every 'ending' theres still new things to see.\n\nAll in all an excellently done localisation of the single best sci-fi visual novel ever written, quite possibly THE  best visual novel full stop.", "timestamp_created": 1505925581, "timestamp_updated": 1505925581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35084113": {"recommendationid": "35084113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031994154", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 1898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506975127}, "language": "english", "review": "Best VN of all time, now with a superior new translation.

When things began turning for the worse I had a difficult time coping with and accepting what was happening.\n\nIt's not a perfect story by any means. It has some pacing issues, a ton of exposition at certain points and personally while the main character's development is exceptional some of his irritating personality traits from the original persist throughout the novel. Yet, if there was any experience in any media I could convey to others, Alternative would be it.\n\nPossibly both Alternative's biggest boon and sin is the necessity of its predecessor. While the original Muv Luv had many cringe-worthy absurdities the player had to trek through, it was imperative to really see what the main character is fighting for and how that influences the actions he takes, along with how the world affects him. Above all I feel, is that it really helps immerse the player into the MC's role and mindset. This particular element is what makes some of Alternative's best and infamous scenes so emotionally compelling. I have never been sent into such a state of disarray by one certain scene and most people who have read MLA will know what scene I'm referring to.\n\nThe writer supposedly sold his ancestral home to fund this game(which originally released in 2006) and it really shows with the production values far exceeding that of most modern VNs. The in-game sprites are all lip-synced and blink, the sound-design is top notch, there's a dedicated UI for when you're in a mech, a ridiculous amount of CGs, a ton of sprites including minor characters and a ton of sprite animations for both the characters and mechs.\n\nIf anyone has any shred of interest in this, I implore them to go in as blind as possible. I wish the in-game menus and promotional material didn't spoil a bunch of elements but even so I can whole-heartedly recommend this. I can't guarantee it'll be your favorite VN or anything(there are many who would refer to Alternative as such) it's something that will certainly stand out among its peers and present you with an experience only it can offer.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1505806434, "timestamp_updated": 1505806434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504219", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35059539": {"recommendationid": "35059539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080222887", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510219174}, "language": "schinese", "review": "MUV\u7cfb\u5217\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u9664\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbeZ\u4ee5\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u8fd8\u4f1a\u91cd\u65b0\u56de\u5473\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1~", "timestamp_created": 1505805703, "timestamp_updated": 1505805703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35059526": {"recommendationid": "35059526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105423012", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511794427}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5b87\u5b99\u795e\u4f5c\uff0c\u6700\u71c3galgame", "timestamp_created": 1505805571, "timestamp_updated": 1505805571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35059474": {"recommendationid": "35059474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047187058", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 6505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513165835}, "language": "english", "review": "When I first read Muv-Luv Alternative a few years back, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. Coming off of Extra/Unliminted (the prequels), the series didn\u2019t seem to have gotten off to a good start. But after indulging in it for nearly 100 hours over 2 weeks, I was so engaged in this visual novel that I can firmly say that it is my favorite of all time. \n\nAlternative completely deviates from the atmosphere and tone set in Extra/Unlimited and takes a more serious, gritty approach to sci-fi worlds. It takes the characters established in Extra and the setting introduced in Unlimited, then pushed them to their maximum potential. \n\nMuv Luv Alternative is an epic in the full sense of the word. It is a long journey that takes you and the characters through many trials and tribulations. This novel manages to fill every crossroad with meaning and growth. It invests so much into its characters to make every loss painful and every victory as heartfelt as possible. \n\nI have no good way to relay all the emotions and respect I have for this title. Alternative is truly one of the best sequels to exist being much better Extra/Unlimited. In fact, I\u2019d even go venture to say that it is one of the best sci-fi adventures I have ever read. But more than that, the story has left such a great impression on me that I can\u2019t forget any of the moments in it. I became so invested into the world and the characters struggling through it. Everything they felt, I felt as well. \n\nOf course, Muv Luv Alternative is not without its flaws, but I\u2019ll let other reviews sift through those fine points. It\u2019s not something for the faint of heart as for how dark and gruesome it can get. But, I wanted to share a bit of my own feelings and experiences with this work to hopefully inspire others to witness this masterpiece. Muv Luv Alternative is an experience like no other, and as such, I highly recommend it to anyone with even the slightest bit of interest. . \n", "timestamp_created": 1505805213, "timestamp_updated":

I played the original release of the game multiple times and it was only further improved in this release on steam. I don't need to make much comment on the characters or art style since they are the same as in Extra and Unlimited so you know what to expect. If you haven't yet played those first two games in the Muv-Luv, I STRONGLY recommend playing them first as without the context and without knowing the characters, the unbelievable impact of Alternative will be lost.\n\nTHE STORY of Muv-Luv Alternative is what makes it so special. This piece of fiction is my favourite story ever, in any medium. I haven't found a novel, TV show, movie, ANYTHING that I enjoyed the plot of more than Muv-Luv Alternative. This story will pull you in and bring you on a rollercoaster experience you have never seen before. The \"ABOUT THE GAME\" section here on steam might sound a bit dramatic but I wholeheartedly agree with how epic they make this game sound. If you could ever imagine yourself enjoying a dark and thrilling piece of science fiction then you need to play Muv-Luv Alternative.\n\nMuv-Luv Alternative brings a whole new feel to the Muv-Luv series. Where the transition from Extra to Unlimited toned down the romance and comedy and brought in a more intricate storyline, Alternative is another step up from that. Don't expect much comedy here.\n\nCompared to the original, the steam version seems to have fixed the horrible Engrish and has polished some game assets.  The main problem with the original was the horrible game engine which is completely gone now. The game runs on a sleek, quick engine and is very nice visually.\n\nMuv-Luv Alternative isn't just a game, it's a journey.\n\nI can't recommend it enough.", "timestamp_created": 1505798645, "timestamp_updated": 1505798645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527638", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35058358": {"recommendationid": "35058358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013414625", "num_games_owned": 1275, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503487488}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good.

There are VNs I like more, to be sure, this isn't my favorite, but this is a saga, unlike other VNS. A 100 hour + story from multiple VNs concluding in this game, dating back decades. It's just insane the detail put into what I thought was a Romcom. For real, I first got into Muv Luv for a semi-funny romcom and I got that. \n\nThen Unlimited came and I was like \"Wow, that was a lot better than what I thought was gonna be a short parody thing, really well thought out.\"\n\n\nAfter that, Alternative came out in late 2011, and I read that then.

Depending on reading speed, you're in for about 80 hours of story that will put you on an emotional roller coaster.  Alternative is the sequel to Extra/Unlimited.  In the previous games you followed the main character as he first dealt with normal high school days and then when he somehow ended up in a world under attack by the BETA.  \n\nNow you get to see how it all comes together in the end.  I won't say more than that about the story.\n\nAs for the game itself, what I've experienced so far makes this feel like the best version of the game.  I've previously read the fan translated version and while that was good, there were some sacrifices made(including several scenes that required stopping to read a text file).  While I haven't had much time with this release I can already see vast improvements.  For example, in the opening scene there are english voices used and those have been re-dubbed so they now don't sound like native Japanese trying to speak english.  These are scenes that were always supposed to be in english, but now they actually sound like it.  \n\nIf I had one gripe it would be about a small full screen issue.

Pretty damn good, they've re-done the translation completely and have managed to capture the character kinks and speech charms a lot better than the original translation, they've also included extra CG's for certain scenes and extra dialouge here and there making it a much better experience, and the upgraded engine making it run smoother. along with every diagram/map being fully translated it helps you understand what's going on better.\n\nNext i'll just give my opinion on alternative itself\n\nIt is, without a doubt, the best Visual novel on the market (That's been translated) that i have ever read\nYou DO need to have read most of the routes of  Extra and at least 1 of Unlimited to enjoy this, it's a part 3 to Muv-Luv's first two parts\n\nThe story is incredible, it takes what you thought you knew about the betaverse of the series and blows it all away, nothing you learned in the first two VN's is entirely accurate, there are many secrets yet uncovered and many points of developments to be had.\n\nThe strongest point of Alternative is most definitely it's character development, whilst the characters themselves may be fittable in to the standard Archetypes, the way they're made to interact with the expansive world and other characters plus the inceredibly intruguing events that take place in this VN breathes life in to them, i've heard people saying that having only one route makes this VN bad, however you should not look at it this way, Alternative does not have 'one route', it is a single story with one outcome, The characters develop together and better themselves through debate, conflict, sorrow and such forth, unlike route based novels where the development is lopsided, everyone develops together.\nAlso on this note, the main character does not suffer from the self-insert problem that most vn's suffer from, in fact he is  the most amazing source of character development throughout this novel.\n\nAnyway, the novel deals with some heavy topics such as general ethics, patriotism, politics, coping, ptsd and many more in an absolutely beautiful way, this isn't some shitty Eroge nor is it a Kusoge, if you think it's either you're simply reading it wrong.\n\nMost of this was just rambling, but this was my 6th time reading this novel through and i'm glad that i backed it when i did, our folks over at the Muv Luv Team did an amazing job bringing such a great localisation to us in such a short time for a VN this length, and they even managed to dodge the censor bullet that most Steam releases fall to (I mean, yeah there's no explicitally r-18 scenes however most scenes were completely uncensored apart from the 2 original h-scenes which were basically just given a new CG that displayed less and had the text remain mostly the same, which is great)\n", "timestamp_created": 1505783934, "timestamp_updated": 1505783934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504219", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35055826": {"recommendationid": "35055826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122059825", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506053274}, "language": "english", "review": "What is Luv?\n\n[spoiler]BETA don't hurt me..

MLA is by far the best fictional story I've ever experienced, and nothing has topped it since I first read it about 3 years ago. I discovered this series because it is the highest rated VN on VNDB. I had only read a few other VNs before, so, I instantly got interested and dove into it practically blind. I would highly encourage you to do so too. \n\nDespite my high praise for this series, Muv Luv is not perfect. Far from it in fact. However, one thing it does better than anything else is a subversion of expectations. After reading through the happy-go-lucky Extra and Unlimited, I was beginning to have my doubts that this VN was going to be the masterpiece that it was hyped up to be. And god damn, I've never been so glad to be wrong. Parts of this VN have some of the best writing, character development, and plot twists I've ever seen. But other parts are extremely sloppy and rushed. I have some mixed feelings about parts of Muv Luv, but overall I would still consider it to be my favorite work of fiction.\n\nWith that, I'll go over some good, bad, and neutral points about MLA with minimal spoilers.\n\nGood:\n-MLA has the best story I've ever read. It gives one of the most emotionally powerful experinces I've ever had. Takeru's character developement is nothing short of a masterpiece. The story sheds light on many different topics, including military strategy, PTSD, quantum causality, politics, nationalism, philosophy, traumatic psychology, time loops, etc. The characters, old as well as new, are great, each with their own views on the world and the ongoing war.\n-Muv Luv has an amazingly well written multiverse. The logic is consistent and key points make sense within the world's perameters. Nearly every part of the military operations are explained in great detail, all the way down to squad formations, technical specs of the TSF's, and strategic countermeasures for each type of BETA.\n-There in a incredible use of foreshadowing, with later major events being traced back to even the opening scenes of Extra. The payoff for reading Extra and Unlimited is truely amazing.\n-The action sequences are a fantastic, as Muv Luv Alternative has one of the highest production values out of any VN. \n-MLA features an amazing soundtrack.\n-The mecha design is amazing. Each TSF is based on a real life fighter jet counterpart, and the weaponry is conventional, unlike something you would see from Gundam or any other mecha show.\n\nNeutral:\n-You have to sit through about ~30 hours of a non-action, slice of life, slapstick comedy VN trilogy before you get to the \"good part.\" This could be a plus or minus for some. I was one of the weird ones who really enjoyed the first two VNs in the trilogy. However many do not, especially if you're coming for the action and mecha aspect. DON'T be that guy, please. It's extremely important to read the first two VN's before Alternative. It's called a trilogy for a reason.\n-There are points in this VN where its visuals might be too much for squeamish people. There is a heavy use of gore and nudity during some key story points.\n\nBad:\n-The ending arc was obviously rushed. I feel like there could have been a much more comprehensive and well thought out ending, since the one we got felt a bit cheap. Some people argue that an ending is what really makes a story good or bad, and this might be one of the biggest complaints from readers.\n-If you don't get emotionally invested in the story from reading through Extra and Unlimited, the story will be very ineffective. It relies on the reader to experience emotions similar to that of the main character. \n-With such a big cast of characters, I feel like we did not get to see each one's development as well as we should have. Many new characters are introduced about half way into the story, and once they show up, many of the old characters lose any and all focus and dialogue.\n-The best songs in the sountrack are usually only played in a few specific parts, and most of the time it uses songs from Extra for background noise during conversation.\n\nVisual Novels tell the reader the story through the eyes of the protagonist. This might be the most important aspect of MLA, and the reason why it is so successful at telling a compelling and emotional story. Not being able to know what Takeru was thinking all the time would have made this VN significantly less impactful. MLA's intense action sequences, soundtrack, and excellent production value elevate the story to a new level. For these reasons, MLA could never do well translated into any other medium, and only really works as good as it does as a Visual Novel.\n\nTL;DR: The Muv Luv Trilogy is absolutely amazing.

[spoiler] Sumika best girl [/spoiler]\n\nRemember, the ultimate experience REQUIRES that you play the prequels, Muv-Luv Extra and Muv-Luv Unlimited, before starting this chapter. Extra, though very much a standard visual novel, introduces and endears the characters of this game, giving insight into their personalities, their desires, their dreams.. and making this final chapter all the more incredible.\n", "timestamp_created": 1505779724, "timestamp_updated": 1505779724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586719", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35055162": {"recommendationid": "35055162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008052842", "num_games_owned": 774, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505671838}, "language": "english", "review": "[b][u]Reviewer's Notes:[/u][/b]\n\nFor the sake of full disclosure I did back this on Kickstarter. I have completed the Muv-Luv Trilogy, via the unofficial fan translation, twice.\n\nThe Steam version of this game is the All Ages version. That means the explicit adult content that is in the normal game is removed or censored. There will be a Director's Cut patch at some point in the future that will address that.  Unlike with Muv-Luv Extra and Unlimited, however, I do not think that the censoring of the explicit content is a detriment to Alternative and the experience as a whole.\n\nThis review will be as spoiler free as I can make it. The thing that makes the Muv-Luv experience so memorable is not knowing where it is going to go or what will happen next. I would hate to ruin that for someone else.  Do not play Alternative until you have completed Muv-Luv Extra and Unlimited.  My review for Muv-Luv Extra and Unlimited can be found [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/seffles/recommended/449830/]here[/url].\n\n[b][u]Overview:[/u][/b]\n\nAs mentioned in my previous review the Muv-Luv Trilogy is considered by many, myself included, to be one of the best Visual Novel experiences of all time.  Where Muv-Luv's Extra and Unlimited primarily introduced the player to the characters and to the universe Muv-Luv Alternative is the heart and soul of the Trilogy.  It will take you to the highest of highs and drag you to the lowest of lows.  It isn't going to pull any punches.\n\n[b][u]Story:[/u][/b]\n\n[i]Our protagonist, Shirogane Takeru, wakes up once more in his room convinced that everything that had happened before was a dream.  The thought doesn't stay for long.  Just like before, upon leaving his house, reality quickly sets in.  It has been roughly three years since the end of Unlimited, though his memory is foggy in places and completely blank after a certain point, and Takeru finds himself back in the hellish war torn world he had already suffered through at least once before.  It is October 22nd and he remembers the deadline and what will happen.  With the events of Alternative V still fresh in his mind he sets out to find Yuuko, to do everything over but this time differently.  This time he knows what will happen, he already spent years training and honing his abilities so he won't hold anyone back, and with his knowledge of those events he begins his work to change it.  To prevent Alternative V from coming to fruition.  To see Alternative IV completed and humanity saved.[/i]\n\nUnlike Extra, and to a lesser extent Unlimited, Alternative is a Kinetic Visual Novel.  There are technically some different routes and definitely a few places that you will get to make decisions but ultimately the experience is mostly set in stone and the choices matter little.  It starts out as a typical power fantasy before snowballing out of control and taking the player on a trip they'll probably never forget.  Extra and Unlimited had moments of emotional impact but Alternative takes all of that and cranks it to 11.  It was deliberately written and designed in a way that ensures the twists and turns it takes will always hit for maximum effectiveness, high or low.  The characters see actual growth throughout by taking what we've already learned and giving them proper conclusions.\n  \nNow that isn't to say that the story is perfect, that there are no plot holes or contradictions, that the pacing is always spot on, or that the things people have criticized the series for over the years (like very heavy use of info dumping) aren't there anymore.  Depending on who you ask some or all of that stuff is still present, though I personally believe the updated translation has made a huge difference.\n\nSo when the smoke finally settles, the tissue box is empty, and the credits start to roll feel free to utilize Extra as a palate cleanser while we wait for Altered Fable.  It'll be a good excuse to go back and hunt for all the various bits of foreshadowing and what not that was slipped in years in advance and you'll need something to feel good again anyway.\n\n[b][u]Visuals:[/u][/b]\n\nDespite being over a decade old Muv-Luv Alternative looks great.  The sprite work, the backgrounds, the CGs, movies, and action sequences are top notch.  It is pretty easy to notice some of the newer assets designed specifically for the All Ages version of the game (which is based off the Japanese console version) but they aren't harmful to the experience.\n\nIf you like what you saw in Extra and Unlimited you're going to get more of that, just on steroids.\n\n[b][u]Sound Design:[/u][/b]\n\nAlternative utilizes much of the same soundtrack that Extra and Unlimited used which helps create a very cohesive experience.  There are a few new tracks that will pop up here and there but mostly it will be stuff you're already familiar with.  They do an excellent job of picking the right tracks for the right moments.\n\nSound effects are about the same with some small improvements here and there.  The mixing on the other hand is significantly improved from the original release.\n\nVoice acting is still top notch, with the new additions to the cast doing a great job.  For the first time, thanks to the official localization, we now get proper English during a couple of sequences and they're solid.  Hopefully the option to toggle between the new English and the old beloved \"Engrish\" is added in the future.\n\n[b][u]System:[/u][/b]\n\nMuch of what I said previously for Extra and Unlimited still holds true here.  If you didn't like the mobile game influenced UI, the no save slot notes, the non adjustable text colors, and so on you're probably still not going to like it.  But if you did like the fact that you can play the game on about any computer without it freezing, crashing, or just being difficult, good news! Alternative performed perfectly and I had no issues.\n\nAs for special features we get an Extras section that is mostly what you would expect.  The CG Gallery is scrollable from the get go and the Chapter Select is very nice.  But why no Jukebox?  I feel like that was a mistake.\n\nNow on to the most important part: the updated translation.  Look, I am glad that Ixrec translated the trilogy back in the day.  I really am because that was how I was first exposed to the series and it was amazing.  But the difference between that fan translation and this version is quite frankly astounding.  It is just better in every way.  Everything actually makes sense, character motivations were \"fixed,\" the political intrigue isn't full of contradictions, the hard science info dumps aren't full of nonsensical babble, and tone remains far more consistent.  At times it felt like I was playing a different game and it was great.  This is the best way to experience Muv-Luv Alternative.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion:[/u][/b]\n\n[i]\"One day, when you get to the point where you can laugh at your mistakes...I'm sure you'll rediscover whatever you've lost...\"[/i]\n\nIn a game full of memorable lines this one always got to me.  I'm sure it did for others.  It marks a turning point of sorts, where you realize that things will get worse, much worse, before they're going to get better.  That is the Alternative experience condensed into a single line and it is an experience that I think everyone should try.  I can't promise you will like it, let alone love it, but I know I do.

It's the #1 rated VN of all time on VNDB and people recommend this as a must-read even though the mandatory prequel (Muv-Luv) is generally seen as fairly mediocre.\n\nMy impression after reading Alternative is that it's quite excellent, but also has its fair share of problems. Here is a list of my pros and cons with the game:\n\nPros:\n+ Alternative has a strong cast of several returning characters as well as many new favorites that are introduced. For the most part they all have a layer of depth to them, even if some of them didn't get that much screen time. If you liked Meiya from Muv-Luv, Alternative will be right up your alley, and even if you didn't, there are still several great supporting characters.\n+ I've never been a huge fan of action in visual novels because you can't really show it all that well with just images, but Alternative did a great job of keeping me on the edge of my seat despite that.\n+ The plot gets quite complex and interesting, and weaves the individual characters' stories with the overall narrative very well.\n+ Alternative gets you emotionally involved with what's going on. Don't be surprised if you start crying or stare at the screen in utter shock.\n\nCons:\n- I don't really care for the protagonist, Takeru Shirogane. His irritating personality traits from Muv-Luv continue well into Alternative.\n- At times the story drags on with unnecessary drama, rehashed conversations and overuse of flashbacks.\n- The ending was a bit of a letdown for me.\n- Reading Muv-Luv Alternative's prequel, Muv-Luv, is mandatory. Unfortunately, Muv-Luv is in my opinion a really big mixed bag of some good stuff and some straight-up bad and cringe-worthy stuff. But it lays the background and character development you need in order to know what's going on in Alternative.\n\nOverall I can definitely recommend Muv-Luv Alternative and while it wasn't the end-all-be-all of visual novels for me, it was still excellent and gets a spot on my list of favorites.\n\nTL;DR: Get it.

Labor of love.. never seen a dev more excited and motivated to work on a game! Very responsive and active in the community...\n\nThis isn't like any of the other games I have.. I have a lot of games. It's one of the more unique games I've played. I like to collect artistic/weird or interesting games. It's like Link went for a reach around on Mario (64) and shot out a whole new basket of fun. \n\nI haven't put much time in at all. Hopefully better controller supports will be added soon. There is the key binding option but I suck at figuring it out. I blame the buzz.\n\nThis game is really fun even though I really suck at aiming for anything with my mouse. I couldn't draw a stick figure with my mouse so I die a lot... The graphics are so satisfying!!!! Super cute little cubes!! I love the battle style. You pretty much make a line, like mini golf games work but you are in battle so you have to be quick... and the cube goes launching at anything ahead of it. But not overkill. It's physics-ly satisfiying for a basic gamer (it is believable, you know, if you were from the world of cubes).\n\nWorth the tag. If you can afford to support Early Access with a dev that is sure to push this gem to a wonderful release point... and probably keep going after that.. Give it a shot!

I really do.  But there are some little things that just bring down the whole experience for me.  Let's start with the combat.  When it works the way it should, it's awesome!  You can string together attacks to take down a large group of enemies in one long and exciting chain and it's just incredible BUT!  There are glitches and bugs which ruin it for me.  For example, I'm trying to take down one enemy, I aim my attack, and one of three things can happen: 1, I hit the target successfully; 2, my character turns just a bit to the left or right (without me actually doing so) and misses; or 3, my character goes flying in the complete OPPOSITE direction I was pointing!  Not to mention there are some enemies that either can't be killed or take far, FAR too many hits to take down.  (Might just be me)\n\n(EDIT: An ingame options menu has been added, thanks craigz!)\n\nI would like to reiterate that I really, REALLY want to like this game.  I think it has lots of potential to be an extremely fun and enjoyable experience.  But at the time of writing this, it's not.  At least not for me.  The issues I pointed out above as well as a few others just drag the whole thing down for me, and for that, I can't recommend it.

Obviously, because if you are the intelligent individual you are, you read the description before reading reviews. Now on to the actual review. I am going to be doing a 10/10 review on Graphics, sound, etc. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGraphics\nThe graphics in this game are cartoony and I can see how that might make some people look the other way but hang in there. The graphics are not at all realistic in any way, meaning they are minimalistic, simplistic, and cartooney as mentioned previously. I personally like the simplistic graphics but I still think they could use some work.\nOverall I would rate the graphics a 6/10\n\nObviously, graphics are not the main selling point in most indie games so if you have bought indie games previously with simplistic graphics this should be fine. Even if you haven't you will be fine.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSound\nThere are some decent sounds in Warcube. The sounds overall are not revolutionary, however, they are still good and are probably better than what you will find in a lot of indie games, but still not revolutionary. \nOverall I would rate the sounds a 7/10\n\nSame with graphics sounds are not the main selling point of indie action games so that is why I give it the rating I did.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGameplay\nThe gameplay in Warcube is about the most unique and fun things I have played in a LONG time. You use a variety of weapons found throughout the game including, dynamite, crossbows, and the legendary sword in the stone! There are some problems with the aiming reticle when you try to charge a melee attack or shoot a bow. But don't let that hinder your feelings for the game because for me it doesn't happen that often and in the heat of combat even if it does mess up you will still hit someone so it is fine.\nOverall I will rate the Gameplay a 9/10\n\nThis is the main selling point of the game and I believe that the game does deserve this rating based on its current status. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGif Capture\nGenerally, this would not be a section in a review but this little indie game is an exception. The game has a built-in gif capture system allowing you to make gifs of the last few seconds of gameplay. Then the gif is placed in a file that is convenient menu if you hit escape during the game. \nOverall I rate it a 10/10\n\nI give it this only because of how rare this is to see in a game and I think that it works well. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSettings\nFor those hardcore gamers that have the best computer money can buy, you will be disappointed with the graphical settings because there are only two settings low and high, These not changing much but still a welcome addition. The audio settings are probably what you would expect from this type of game, master volume slider, music slider, and SFX volume slider. The third and final section of settings are the game settings including key remapping, cursor visibility, and a few others mentioned below. \nGraphics settings (in order of appearance)\nQuality - Low or high \nAmbient occlusion (AO) - On or off\nToggle fullscreen - On or off\nAntialiasing - None, 2x, or 4x\nMap shadows - On or off\n\nAudio\nMaster volume slider\nMusic volume slider\nSound effects (SFX) volume slider\n\nGame \nKey Remapping - which allows you to change any of the keys to any button\nEpic Gif Capture - Which allows you to capture \"epic gifs\" applying a filter to the gif\nCursor visible - allows you to turn the cursor on or off\nReset game - which by its name resets your progress\nIsometric movement - This turns off fluent movement basically only allowing you to move in the cardinal directions\nFrames Per Second (FPS) display - Shows your frames in the top right corner\nOverall I will consider the settings a 7/10 \n\nI give it this score not because the settings don't work but because I think there could be more of them, especially for graphics. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEaster Eggs \nThere are a good number of easter eggs in the game waiting for you to find. I am not going to list them here because they are easter eggs you are supposed to find them yourself. \nOverall I rate this a 9/10\n\nI rate it this because the easter eggs in it are good and make sense but there could be more. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nContent\nThe game has A LOT more content since it launched back at the beginning of 2017, however, this game is still VERY, VERY MUCH in development. Right now there are 14 complete maps, a map that is still under construction but is available to play, and two maps you can see but can't play. Each map consists of probably 20 minutes of game time for completionist route and about 10 minutes for casual play. There are, however, a lot of weapons and armor already in the game and readily available each with different looks and slightly different stats. also. there are some cosmetics that you can apply to yourself to look different but that is all they do. Finally, there is a special ability which is not going to be the only one but for now, it is. \nOverall I give this a 7/10\n\nHear me out as to why. Right now I know there is not all that much content but Craigz (The developer) is very good at getting content out is really working hard so I believe we will see this game go a long way.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDevs and Communication\nCraigz works on everything in the game, except for sound which Blake works on, but Blake doesn't really respond to anyone because he is not full-time on the game. Craigz, as I said before, is very hard working and is working on the game full-time resulting in a lot of communication and soon to be content. Also, Craigz and the mods (myself included) will almost certainly address any problems, concerns, questions, or anything of the sort relatively quickly. \nOverall I give this a 9/10\n\nI give it this because with the combination of a lot of communication from the mods and the dev along with the dev working full-time on the game it is well worth a 9/10.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis concludes the review, I will be updating this as I see fit and feel free to leave me or any other of the mods and or dev a question in the forums, discord or twitter and we will respond to you as soon as possible.", "timestamp_created": 1497740145, "timestamp_updated": 1505569346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32431736": {"recommendationid": "32431736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301102523", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508057425}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great.It has a great dev making it.I enjoy it.", "timestamp_created": 1497523625, "timestamp_updated": 1497523625, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32399913": {"recommendationid": "32399913", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988663774", "num_games_owned": 2355, "num_reviews": 187, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514025847}, "language": "english", "review": "(This is an Early Access review based on version 0.0.5v3.)\n\nWarcube is a fun brawler, though a bit limited and easy right now due to being in very early access.

The individual enemies lack various traits, and there are not many special moves so far, but otherwise, it plays like one would expect a top-down version of shadow of mordor should.

The characters all have six sides, which is nice for consistancy.\nAs for the plot, WHO NEEDS A PLOT WHEN ALL OF THE CHARACTERS HAVE SO MANY SIDES?! Seriously, you won't find a two-dimensional character anywhere in the game. Go on, look! See, I told you.\nAnyway, it is a good game with a good developer. Unlike many, he has actually been updating frequently and adding good content instead of just hats... er... ah well, at least he keeps adding new features and content of all kinds.\nIt is still in beta or alpha or...

By mister I am so funny narrator and everybody knows you and that you were the king. But given the fact that in this kingdom everyone is a cube and the fighting makes great fun and the fact that you are kind of a king, even if your mighty kingdom is run down by barbaric red cubes, it is not that bad. \nThat is kind of how the game of war cube starts, a small little combat game full of humor and all kind of medieval stuff. As already stated the game has good humor but I see the danger of this element becoming too powerful. In this state of the game the humor is hold back to an agreeable amount but if the game is going to define itself just through its humor, I may have to give it a bad review in the future. \nThe surrounding and different levels of the game are drawn beautifully in a now getting so popular low poly graphical style. The world (in this stage of the game) is rather small but given the fact that it is still in early accesses it is in place to hope that the scale of the game is getting bigger and bigger. Because now the game is finished in about 2 hours. Are this 2 hours fun? Yes they are but they leave the player with the slightly uncomfortable feeling of \"I want more!\" and \"already finished?\"\nIn the whole game there is no single indication of which weapon is the best and if the newly found armor is better than the other. A situation which let me to always fight with the same weapons what is not that bad (in this stage of the game) as the variety of armor and different weapons is almost equal to zero. Moreover I think a looting system where you can get some stuff out of the enemies you kill can help the game. I know it is not a revolutionary idea to make a looting system but I desperately want this game to be developed and to give the player more to do inside of the game because just exploring and good humor is not enough. Therefore I would also love to see a good development in the tactical view as I think the rather monotone getting combat system would match very well with a bit of strategic warfare with the tactical view. And moreover it would be interesting to see what bigger battles with warcubes would look like. As I said I think that is a huge area of development that would give the game great dimension. Because what the game does till now is creating a good framework. Now its time to get depth into the game and the different game assets.\nI talked about a general framework of the game being created but this framework is also useful for something else, because this simple framework gives the player something to built his own imagination and own stories around. These aspect of the game principle is the same as in Mount and Blade  as the player can add to the game experience by his own imagination. For example when I hid in the bush and sneaked up to an enemy I was like \"Whoa! That's a great experience I fell like I should have felt when I played Assassins Creed 3\". No that is a bit over the top but I found it interesting that this simple game could generate the same feeling of excitement and anticipation as a huge game like AC 3.\nIn general the now existing early access game is rather small but is already playable and gives adequate game fun and I am especially excited how much potential this game has. So with more time put into development this game can become a real winner.\n\nhttp://architectonreview.blogspot.com.tr/search/label/games", "timestamp_created": 1491484434, "timestamp_updated": 1491484434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.659543", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30967617": {"recommendationid": "30967617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170166230", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1516238768}, "language": "english", "review": "INCREDIBLE!

It's great that the developer took the time to add these little characters and it really shows how much love he's poured into the game so far.\n\nThe controls are a simple affair, left and right mouse buttons control your main melee dash-attack and your ranged weapon respectively whilst you move around the world with WASD, space jumps. This allows the combat to remain fast but fluid, the slow motion combat kicking in when you chain attacks together. The combat can be challenging at times when arrows start raining down and the larger enemies forces you to keep changing your tactics.\n\nThe world that i've seen so far is well made and charming with many little characters to interact with. A great sense of humour is apparent in all these meetings which makes you want to explore and find new NPCs to talk to.\n\nI would definately recommend this game, it's polished, charming and funny and at this price it's already a good deal.

But. No. The game needed more time. A closed alpha then a open one. One thing that annoys me is the price. I strongly believe the price should be lowered. Like seriously. This game is not worth \u00a38. What annoyed me more was the fact that... Well... The dev  says it will cost more. Thats not okay. If this reflects the content to come, im sorry to say I refuse to support the game. Its not up to par. I strongly believe simple games are on a trend right now, this is a very simple game. Thats why its had a strong start. BUT the quality for a \u00a38 game is NOT acceptable to me.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot Capability. \nNone. If you like screenshots like the ones i use [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=848772218]Example[/url] Then this isnt a screenshot capable game.\n\n\n\n\nI do believe theres potential. I think the dev truly wants this game to shine. I do. But theres one fundamentally huge mistake made it ruins it. I would have reccommended this game if it wasnt for it.\n\nThe music is so... Nothing. Theres no suspense or tension built with it. Theres no feeling with it. Its just there. There are fighting situations you go in, yet, the music doesnt change to fit them. Meaning you get calm music in a deadly fight. This has caused me to drop marks drastically, as music is a fundamental feature. 4/10 Im really dissapointed by this basic mistake.\n\n\n\n\nGraphics. Are you serious. Cmon. I understand your working in the unity engine. But please. Make the graphics worth while. Please. Running at high texture and my monitors local res, still showed the bad quality graphics. A few things to fix this: an OPTION (default off) to have black lines around objects.

This just wastes time which is very precious in the first two hours of the refund timer. 1/10\n\n\n\nSo many people have been riding the fame of the game and reccommending.

is a positive game. \nWhen you open the game in the first place.Developers have no direct let you start playing games, He thank the players to buy the game. This is the reason why I determined to write this review. A attaches great importance to the player's developer is worthy of respect. \n\nAlthough the game has only a few hundred MB. But the simple interface could not hide the developers carefully. For the UI design, some interesting small details will make you very friendly. \nIn the process of play games, I have the feeling of a play legend of zelda, it was pretty interesting. Developers joined in combat process similar to the bullet time design, it is very helpful for ascension is the feeling of fighting (At least I feel a few play incredibly square fight really burn ) .\n\nThen talk about the game. As a Low Poly real style of the game, this game on the picture and technical has good balance. But the picture still needs to be promoted, many places still crude, in-game items details are lacking at the same time. Scene modeling is acceptable. But the game role is a square, the performance of the action has a congenital deficiency (Maybe someone will like this style ).So if the game continue to develop, might try to improve it. \n\nFor interoperability, the wonderful video is the primary reason to attract many people to buy the game.\nBut the actual operation is not good, use the keyboard operation is very difficult. Hero's turn is not smooth, and attack judgement is very strange, in many cases I can't hit the enemy. \n\nIn the end is the enemy AI design .\nMaybe I asked too much. But if strengthen the enemy to cooperate, I believe that the game's appeal will be enhanced. \n\nSo far, this game is flawed, but also have advantages. As a word: the road is tortuous, the future is bright. I hope this game can be better development. \n\nPS: the price is very affordable \n\nNote to developers: Hope you add chinese language into the game, because the Chinese market can make you, also can destroy you.

No? Good, because you're not doing either of those things here. Warcube is an action adventure RPG that takes inspiration from a few well received and critically acclaimed games, and and [i]it manages to handle that inspiration well[/i] while at the same time not feeling like a bunch of 'cool' features tacked on at random; the developer did a good job of making sure things fit well into the game.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe combat is great, you could compare it to Shadow of Mordor because of the combo potential with the slow motion of the 300 movie remake, but quite a bit harder as attacks are aimed 100% manually and your mistakes are easily punished by your opponents; if you rush into a group of enemies and miss one of your combo hits, your melee attack will go into a cooldown, the length of which depends on the weapon you're currently using, and you'll be stuck in amongst a large crowd of enemies with your ranged weapon and parry. If you die, the enemy that struck the killing blow will grow into a larger, tougher and more powerful enemy, and will do so again should you lose another fight to it. The videos and gifs on the storefront do a great job of showing how the combat functions, so go look at those.\n\nThe game is \"open world\" in that the world is open, but the levels aren't. In the world map, you move around to points of interests, like camps, castles, towns, and other stuff, which all act as levels which you enter. Some of these points of interest send enemy soldiers out into the world which if you happen to run into, it can cause an ambush encounter where you fight a wave of 20 or so enemies. You can capture these locations, at which point they'll start sending troops of your own to [spoiler]a seige camp outside the first major castle, which is currently in progress[/spoiler]. You can move near them and click on them to have them follow you into levels and encounters, where despite seeming to be half baked, they will fight the enemy until they die.\n\nLevels aren't all that complex, the objectives are pretty simple actually. Kill enemies, capture the flags and open chests for gold, sometimes doing these things aren't all that simple, sometimes the location of things isn't really obvious, sometimes what you have to do to get to the next area in the level can be hard to discover and sometimes it's just a challenge to actually get there.\n\nSomething else about combat is that there's a stealth element, if you haven't been spotted by the nearby enemies, you can sneak around in the often copious amount of bushes to either get into a good position to start the encounter or [spoiler](most probably unsuccessfully)[/spoiler] sneak past them entirely\n\nAnother thing is there's some very well implemented easter eggs and references that are there, you know they're there, but they're not in-your-face obnoxious, or in your way, screaming \"LOOK AT ME!\". I really hope the developer does more stuff like this.\n\n[h1]Story Stuff[/h1]\n\nThere isn't too much story yet, so far we know that you're a godlike being that has been gone from their land for almost 4,000 years, and it seems said land is in the hands of your enemy. Even though there isn't really much story so far, what's there has a nice and enjoyable charm to it, and the narrator / floaty head guy is quite a funny character. Some 4th wall breaking, but it certainly enhances the experience as it's done well.\n\n[h1]Early Access / Developer information[/h1]\n\nAs far as Early Access goes, I have very high hopes for this one. I played the very first Early Access version, which had quite a few crashes and bugs, as well as some things I was concerned about, and I contacted the developer (now this can be done through the Steam forums for the game on the bug report thread), and he not only fixed the bugs and (I think) all of the crashes, but he thanked me for reporting them and said that he's currently working on addressing the things I was concerned about. The game is very much playable in the current state and I'm confident that if something big or game breaking were to pop up in the future, the developer would be jumping all over it asap.\n\n[h1]Worth it?[/h1]\n\nWorth is always subjective, but I can give you facts and my personal opinions to work with. I obtained the game elsewhere for my first playthrough, and bought it the next day despite $9 USD ($12 AUD) being a lot for me to spend on a game right now. Right now the game has 3 to 4 hours of playthrough content, depending on if you rush it or not, but it has plenty of potential for making your own fun by trying to pull of awesome combos or neat tricks with the current arsenal of weapons at your disposal as some hit harder and some combo faster and have very little cooldown when you miss, which can lead to some pretty amazing looking stuff.\n\nIf the currently small playthrough time doesn't bother you, then I'd seriously suggest either getting this game, following and wishlisting it and looking back every week or so, or looking up gameplay on YouTube to see if it can change your mind.\n\nSorry for the very long wall of text, but I've really tried to cover everything, though if I haven't you can reply to this review to ask questions and I'll try my best to answer them. Also, this is my first serious written review, so any feedback or advice would really be appreciated.\n\nI'll attempt to keep this updated within reason, although there may be a time when there's just so much more stuff that I have to entirely rewrite it.", "timestamp_created": 1486129140, "timestamp_updated": 1486130493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

Another thing that would be cool to see happen would be that you could somehow tame the animals so that they would fight for you and mabey even ride them.  Speaking of taming things it would be cool if you could recruit blue soldiers to fight with you.  Somethings I would like to see changed would be  that melee units can not attack you for so for away and that you could do some sort of parcore.

The slowdown, matrix style of the combat allows for very flashy and fast paced playing. It's as simple as it gets, but it really doesn't need much more than that. Combat is relegated to only the two mouse buttons, and from there you need to keep a rhythm going with your melee attacks to keep up the combo.\n\nI am extremely eager and willing to see this game get developed to its full potential. And while I am reccomending this game, I could certainly understand someone who wants to wait until at least a little further down the line for the game to have progressed.

Not a long time, but I was one of those who upvoted it on  greenlight. Since then the developer has been very active in the fledgling community, being very positive and open to new ideas. So now that I have had a chance to play this game, I am very happy to say it was well worth the wait. \n\n     First impressions were very good, as the game opens with some somewhat of a dialogue after you press a strange button, the mysterious voice says you have been asleep for a few thousand years, and implies that you used to be someone of great importance. The voice acting was very good, it was very professional and believable, and does a good job giving some context to the setting.\n\n     Although there are not too many levels fully completed, the ones that are there show off the gameplay quite nicely. The combat seems entirely skill based, as melee weapons seem to do the same damage. In combat, each melee attack is a lunge, if you miss there will be a short cooldown and you will have to wait before attacking again and thus will leave you open to attack. However, if you land a hit, you can immediatley attack again, thus encouraging players to be more deliberate while striking. When you hold down the attack button, the game goes in slow motion and an arrow appears showing where you will go, thus making it a bit easier not to miss. Don't get me wrong, its still very easy to whif, as your movement keys are factored in during the lunge. However, in a large crowd, if you are able to keep the hits going you can almost bowl right through the crowd, this is very satisfying when you manage to pull this off as a miss will lead to certain death, as a few hits will kill you.\n\n     When killed, the enemy dealing the killing blow will grow in size and pwer. If one enemy kills you enough, they basically turn into a boss fight all on their own. While most enemies die in one to two hits, the big boys can tank enormous amounts of damgae and deal just as much with every swing. The only problem is that eventually, the enemy will get so large he won't be able to hit you, though this is probably just a glitch.\n\n     Ranged attacks are both satisfying and frustrating. It is very nice to land a shot and see the enemy fly off screen, especially when leaping through the air. It takes a bit of getting used to but its still fun.\n\n     The look of this game is very nice, its simplistic with bright popping colors that suit the cube theme nicely. Environments are fun to explore and move around.\n\n     All in all this is a fun game, combat is solid, the asthetic is nice, I like the character personlization in this game as you can buy new outfits or find them as well as other cosmetics. I look forward to seeing nerw content come out, as there are only a few levels available at this point, but I can see there is much more to come. Definetly recommend pickling it up.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1485558969, "timestamp_updated": 1485558969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29530080": {"recommendationid": "29530080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020060931", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485556918}, "language": "english", "review": "A very attractive game with solid core mechanics.

Glad people are reviewing this game. But, as someone who personally always is a little leery of those, I wanted to post a \"I paid $10 for this\" review.\n\nAnd it was definitely worth the money.  \n\nThere are glitches, it's pretty brief from what I can tell, and for the love of god the movement needs to be tweaked.\n\nBut it is REALLY. DAMN. FUN. (If you want to see gameplay details, I did a video of the beginning of the game here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEMW8EhM1MU&feature=youtu.be )\n\nThere is a lot of potential here: the way the overworld is set up is really clever, there's a lot of room for cool kingdom building and exploration mechanics, and the combat is stupidly fun. I haven't been this jolly about attacking hordes of enemies since my Dynasty Warriors childhood. The slowmo action is great, I actually really like how floaty the physics are, and even the rudimentary stealth mechanics are enjoyable. My biggest complaints are a few interface weirdnesses (the character screen was very unclear and buggy for me, the overworld map moves really slow but also teleports you) and the movement. It uses grid movement, so W is always up, A is always left, etc rather than AD rotating and WS being forward back...but the game isn't on a grid, and you dash/shoot in any direction. Dashing actually feels better as a movement method than walking, which is baffling. \n\nI was originally going to just try this out since it was just released today, say \"its cool\" and then wait for future versions, but I'm actually going to go finish the Early Access.\n\nSo quick pros cons:\n\nPros:\nFun\nCool combat\nLOTS of potential\nDesigner seems nice and dedicated\n\nCons:\nObviously a few EA bugs\nMoving on tactical map is really slow, but also serves as fast travel which isn't explained.\nFor the love of god make the movement turn with AD and move forward/backward with WS.", "timestamp_created": 1485556766, "timestamp_updated": 1485556766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29529175": {"recommendationid": "29529175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058982127", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494296555}, "language": "english", "review": "As it stands, this game is pretty darn fun. The attacking system is very satisfying when you are able to Dash & Slash at an enemy, Combo the Attack to another, and shot another red cube in the face with an arrow, Not to mention how you can jump in the air and do a slash attack! \n\nThe enemies get stronger if the kill you, Much like the Orcs and Uruks in Shadow of Mordor, I was trying for the longest time to figure out how exactly this game took inspiration from SOM, I JUST now figured that out. There are Stealth-like options for sneaking up on enemies to get the jump on them, as well as crazy acrobatic attacks when you jump off a wall and dash attack a enemy cube! \n\nI definatly recommend this game, even in its current build. There are things that need to be fixed, i found my Aim was a bit rugged at times, but for the most part seemed pretty good. Spawn points can get annoying - I was killed a number of times in a row because of being spawned ontop of a group of Angry red cube bandits!\n\nIts important to remember at the time of this review, the build i played was The Pre-Alpha 0.0.1, I will Update this review as more builds come out - This is for sure a game i would recommend to anyone looking for a challenging, fun, strategic slashing game!\n\nI recommend checking out a video on this game before purchasing, it doesn't have to be THIS video, even any video on youtube.

Warcube is a twist on what you would expect a cube-based game to be thanks to the popularity of Minecraft. In this game, you focus on combat instead of building. The combat is fairly simple, but very well done and responsive. The slow-motion effect is also a nice touch since it adds a \"cinematic feel\" to the game when you're attempting to do a combo or perform a trickshot.\n\nThere is also a nice built-in feature that allows you to create a gif or take a screenshot from inside the game itself and uploads it to imgur. Although I don't find myself using it often, I can see where it may be useful for when others may do a move that they would like to share.\n\nThat being said, my main issue is the small amount of content currently in the game.

You\u2019ve returned to claim back your kingdom (and to fight red cubes). The game consists of one world map split into regions, you can \u201czoom in\u201d and conquer them as you travel, which adds additional dimension to the game. The combat system is quite simple: click on the enemies to charge and damage them, but there\u2019s a twist: after you hit an enemy, the slow mo turns on and there\u2019s a chance to start a new attack, making you \u201ccombo\u201d through your enemies and chain kill them. One thing that deserves extra notice is the developer\u2019s character built into the game: there\u2019s a small cube that you are going to meet as you progress. It gives the game personal approach and makes you feel welcome while playing.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n\u2022\tThe battle system is simple, yet entertaining. Chaining combos is really fun and I feel that this mechanic is not represented enough in video games. Luckily, this game fixes that.\n\u2022\tEnemy gets stronger when he kills you: It\u2019s a pretty cool mechanic that prevents mindless rushing.\n\u2022\tInteresting approach to early access: \u201cdeveloper\u2019s character\u201d makes you feel welcome\n\u2022\tDifferent maps that don\u2019t feel repetitive\n\u2022\tNeat, minimalistic style\n\u2022\tGreat soundtrack\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\u2022\tMovement seems clumsy: especially when you\u2019re going up the slope and trying to jump. Jumping is complicated: not because of challenging terrain, but simply because the jumping mechanics are not implemented well enough yet. Overall, control responsiveness could be a bit better.\n\u2022\tNot much weapon/equipment variety so far\nSummary\n\nYou can see that developer puts his soul into the game: even though there is not too much content yet, there\u2019s a good attention to detail and his \u201epersonal\u201d character presence in the game makes you feel very welcome. Overall, I\u2019d say get it if you want to influence how the game is developed. Otherwise \u2013 wait for full release to experience the game completely.\n", "timestamp_created": 1485534992, "timestamp_updated": 1485534992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518238", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29523250": {"recommendationid": "29523250", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993302934", "num_games_owned": 1032, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485598595}, "language": "english", "review": "These days, thanks to the likes of popular games like Minecraft or Roblox, we've come to associate blocks and cubes with building and creation. Sure, cubes can be used to make stuff, but they're also excellent at destroying things!\n\nIn Warcube you assume the role of a little cube, whose sole responsibility is to reclaim the land from the red bandit cubes. It's clearly evident that the developer has drawn inspiration from the games mentioned in Warcube's description (Shadow of Mordor, Assassin's Creed, Mount & Blade etc) which is excellent for me personally, as I LOVE the free-flow combat mechanic that SoM had, but even more so that the Batman franchise had as well. To find similar mechanics in a game that's clearly as different as Warcube is, is exciting.\n\nWarcube is obviously an early access title and still has a long way to go before it develops into the game that Craigz (dev) envisions it to become, but I have high hopes for the future of Warcube. With the addition of the Arena mode that's coming very shortly, the game is going to have even more to offer than it has now, and whilst I don't yet know what the Arena mode will be like, I can only hope that it's going to be something as addictive as the Endless Mode in Clone Drone in the Dangerzone (RIP 30+ hours).\n\nOne thing that I feel I really need to mention here is that I have never in my life spoken to a developer that has so obviously been so heavily invested in his creation like the developer of Warcube is. Craigz lives, breathes and dreams Warcube and this is exactly the type of developer that I believe will see his product all the way through and out of early access to full release (unlike many others who abandon their games and remain in EA forever). Every bug that I've reported to him and suggestion that I've made on improving the game, he has actioned immediately. He understands and realizes that the input of his community is essential in the development of a successful game, and this is what we as consumers value most (personal opinion).\n\nThe one thing about Warcube that I personally feel needs to be changed, is the soundtrack. I've mentioned this to the developer and he is currently searching for something that's both thematically appropriate but significantly more energetic than the music that the game currently has. Music is very important to me, particularly in a game, and Warcube's music is definitely lacking in energy and inspiration. An upbeat chiptune track would make the game considerably more enjoyable than it is now.\n\nTL:DR The time that I've spent with Warcube so far (almost 3 hours) has been great, and I very much look forward to see where the developer takes it in the future.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing what Warcube is like, you can do so here - \nhttps://youtu.be/wjArFzKOk70\nhttps://youtu.be/Dh1hIGj2Zio\n\nThe resolution upscaling issue has now been sorted by the developer, and the game properly upscales to native resolutions up to 4k.", "timestamp_created": 1485533937, "timestamp_updated": 1485572363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582491", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29523093": {"recommendationid": "29523093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039254957", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485502683}, "language": "english", "review": "A bunch of fun with a lot of promise, Warcube is a quirky and fun game that challenges you to conquer the world through exploration and combat.

And the gameplay is mostly solid - Cool slow-motion and active combat with movement and timing at the fore-front, accompanied with fitting sound and music and set with a good bunch of interactive elements to facilitate gameplay. \n\nWhere the game starts to show its gaps, is quite literally - in the gaps of content. There is just so very little of it. The early access build only has about 2 hours of content available, with limited replay value. The content that is here - is very fun, but there is very little of it available\n\nAnother issue, but very minimal comperativly, is the physics. They feel and act very floatly and \"heavy\" at, seemingly, random.

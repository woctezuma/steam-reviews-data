The setting is pretty charming, it's like a futuristic wild west pirate clusterfuck but it was the actual gameplay I enjoyed the most. There was a much wider variety of classes and guns available that fundamentally changed how you played than I expected and I got good use out of nearly every option throughout the game. It's not like X-Com where you pick an enemy to shoot and get a % chance to hit, you have to aim your gun in the 2d environment and the characters hand wavers up and down slightly so you have to pick your moment to shoot. One of the classes has a laser sight which obviously makes this way easier, but they do lower damage as a compromise, so when you manage to nail a headshot from across the map on one of the high damage but completely manual aiming classes you feel like a fucking badass. One complaint is that it was quite easy, I played on the difficulty level above normal from the start, got 3 stars (max) on every level, then realised at the end of the game when it gives you your stats that I'd only failed one mission throughout the whole game. Guess I could have turned it up at any point, but I didn't, so maybe that's my fault.\n\nYou could also choose from a huge collection of hats that do absolutely nothing but look cool for each character before mission.

For $4.49 (as of Steam's 2017 Winter Sale), you get a [b] serious [/b] bang for your buck. The gameplay is fluid, the controls are solid (and even if you don't like them, you can change them), the dialogue is comical, and the combat is intense.\n\n[h1] Difficulty [/h1]\nThis game clearly expects you to be one thing: [b] PRECISE. [/b] Seriously, if you make one mistake, you might not hurt too badly. But more than that, you better pray to survive the late-game levels playing on Regular difficulty. (Speaking of which, you can change the game's difficulty to one of [b] five. [/b])\n\n[h1] Combat and Ricochet [/h1]\n[i] SteamWorld Heist [/i]'s combat is no joke. If one of your crew members dies, it's a nearly guarunteed lost mission. Strength in numbers is VERY important when combatting enemies. You're unlikely to defeat three enemies with only one crew member, even if that crew member is powerful.\n\nNow, the [b] ricochet mechanic [/b] is so FUN to use! Are you in a really bad spot and can't move any further to take a shot? Well, use ricochet to your advantage. I'd say that 9/10 times you'd be able to do some decent damage with some good aim.\n\n[h1] Verdict [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I highly recommend it.\n[*]19/20", "timestamp_created": 1514418825, "timestamp_updated": 1514418958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580019", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38754638": {"recommendationid": "38754638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143787168", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514384362}, "language": "english", "review": "100%ed it and it was worth the 10 hours", "timestamp_created": 1514410270, "timestamp_updated": 1514410270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38754412": {"recommendationid": "38754412", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176927434", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514416273}, "language": "english", "review": "\"This game is very good, 10/10\"- Pete", "timestamp_created": 1514409880, "timestamp_updated": 1514409880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493827", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38740316": {"recommendationid": "38740316", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992211474", "num_games_owned": 558, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514384605}, "language": "english", "review": "Such an excellent little game for a surprisingly low amount of HD space (not that it is a problem these days)\nI only started to play it out of pure boredom but got quickly hooked in to it's gameplay and design.\n5/5, would steal again!", "timestamp_created": 1514385584, "timestamp_updated": 1514385584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38719099": {"recommendationid": "38719099", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079542669", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514416977}, "language": "english", "review": "Got this game as apart of a bundle and didn't really expect anything from it. 20 hours later it is by far one of my favourite games with every hour spent full of enjoyment, The game can be played casually or on a very challenging level that never seems unfair and challenges the player to adapt and try new strategies.

Your options are move and shoot. Every encounter is the same. Use up your move to open a door, 5 enemies behind it.

Not only that, almost every encounter comes with a \"countdown\", forcing you to move quickly or deal with endless waves of enemies and/or security turrets that spawn all over. Pretty repetitive if you ask me. Can't really compare this to XCOM as many other reviewers have, as XCOM was not only more challenging, but provided other options than run and shoot, namely Overwatch (take cover and shoot at whatever moves). Characters get abilities later on, but these are underwhelming, i.e. \"shoot for more damage\" or \"waste your action to do blah\".

THIS game only costs 15 bucks, has a lengthy campaign (far longer than I initially expected after the first 3 or so hours), great gameplay, a great art style with good animation quality, some humour and even replay value. Oh, and probably one of the best game soundtracks you've ever heard.\n\nSo, this game is set in the same universe as Steamworld Dig...and boy, I hope they continue to expand this universe.\nWhat you get here essentially combines some aspects of the by now often used XCOM combat gameplay, just in 2D and with shorter levels with some minor crew management and upgrading through levelling up and finding/buying new weapons.\n\nEvery level has you invade an enemy vessel (or station, doesn't matter) that is partly randomly generated and consists of various \"rooms\" with loot and enemies in them. Enemies are not just triggered by opening doors though. Your goal in every level is to gather as much loot as you can and reach a certain objective to be able to trigger the retreat mechanic, which has you gathering all your steam driven combatants in one area of the vessel. Destroying generators, reaching areas, destroying all enemies are all objectives at one point or another. You go in with 1 to 4 of your 10 bots strong crew (with the DLC it's 10 I think). In many levels you will also have to deal with a steadily increasing alarm level that's on a timer and spawns new enemies periodically as well as fixed gun turrets.\n\nEverything you've collected after successfully escaping an enemy vessel gives you resources and/or items for your crew. With the resource water you can buy new items (or hats, cosmetic items) as well as additional storage space, so you can have even more items. And items go on your characters of course. Every character gets to wield one weapon, but they are restricted to certain weapon classes, i.e. handguns, sharpshooters, shotguns, assault rifles or SMGs and heavy weapons like miniguns or rocket launchers. Each weapon type and weapon has different stats and characteristics like bullet spread, two shots, no shots after moving, arcing shots, etc. Two more slots are occupied by various support items like armor, damage powerups, healing items, etc. and last but not least you get to choose a hat for your character (did I already mention enemies also wear hats and you can shoot them off to loot them?!?!?).\n\nYou'll also gain stars (prestige) for collecting loot, reaching the objective and making it out without any casualties. You need those stars to unlock later stages of the game, as well as recruit some new bots or buy certain items, but it's a fair system. And lastly your bots earn XP after every mission, unless they die. The XP simply gets split among all bots.\n\nThe gameplay then plays like XCOM: move, attack or sprint and take cover. The biggest difference here is that it's not 3D, so you can only be flanked from one side...as well as above and below of course, so it's still three sides in the end. The biggest difference, however, is that you have to manually aim your shots. While you can target an enemy with the shoot command, the weapon sway doesn't guarantee a hit...or full hit, which is especially problematic with short range weapons that don't have laser sights. With the latter you can also perform ricochet shots and hit enemies from interesting angles. Think grenade bouncing in \"Worms\".\n\nThe enemies in the game vary quite a lot. Every enemy has its own stats and characteristicts, from cannon fodder to exploding melee bots to teleporting or flying enemies. Additionally you have to take low and high cover as well as environmental hazards into account when planning your moves. I can't stretch how much fun the combat is and getting increasingly better and cooler weapons. There's also some boss fights at the end of a chapter that are really well done and require a good strategy. In short: They're well done and fun.\n\nAnd of course there's the phenomenal soundtrack in the hub areas and also during combat. If you think space country could be your thing...grab it!\n\nNow to a few negative points:\n- Item management is a bit of a chore, even though there is a sorting feature, but at least you can always see who carries what items when selecting them.\n- Crew progression is too linear in my opinion. While every crew member is distinct and has unique traits, they simply level up and get one new skill or stat increase. This is something that could very well be improved upon should there be a sequel.\n- Controls with mouse and keyboard are well done for the most part, but it should not be possible to shoot with the left mouse button since that will always mess up your shot. Took a while till I realized that using space bar is the way to go.\n- Fen the Outsider is probably the most interesting (and arguably the strongest) character in the game, but is locked behind a DLC, despite integrating seamlessly into the story. Steam says he was released the same day the game was released, so that is something that annoys me quite a bit, since it's a whopping 5 bucks, a THIRD of the whole game price. I got it in a bundle, but still. That's unfortunately a big minus.\n\nAll in all though I had a blast. It's one of those games I just wanted to continue playing for some reason. And after you beat the campaign you can go at it in New game plus and choose a higher difficulty (there are 5 after all). That means you keep all bots and hats, but start at level 0 with no items. Definitely something to consider when you want to know how much value you get here for 15 lousy bucks. Other games barely offer 2 or 3 hours of gameplay for the same amount of money.

The base game isn't overly long and can probably be completed in 10-12 hours. If you want max ratings on all levels, and maxing out the levels of your characters, you'll be looking to about 16-18 hours (two levels away from beating the game!).\n\nJust like in the other steamworld games, there is a huge penalty when you die, ranging from 25% to 75% of your funds. Luckily you won't really need those funds, since its fairly easy to get new and powerful guns from replaying levels. And, of course, the less funds you have, the cheaper the penalty is.\n\nThe characters are all cute in their own ways, from an aggressive farmhand to an old bot who is sick of retirement. If you're familiar with Steam Powered Giraffe, their band makes many cameos and is featured in the OST.\n\nHonestly, theres no reason you shouldn't have this game.

Kapew!\n\nEDIT: I realized this isn't very helpful, so I'll clean up a little under here\n\nThe game play is much like a 2D XCOM or Invisible Inc., but unlike XCOM you don't have a hit percentage. You need to line up your shot with your controller or mouse, depending on how you play. And even then the aim isn't static; The gun bobs up and down to add a bit of challenge and timing to when you fire the shot. \n\nThere are various guns that are available in the game and they are divided into various classes, namely:\nThe sharp shooter: Your regular sniper-like gun. They are the only class of guns that come with a laser sight to assist with aiming, but most of them require the user to not move before firing. Excellent guns to use for crazy skillshots around cover\n\nShotguns: Fires a spread of projectiles that only richochet on short range, but are very powerful up close\n\nMachine guns: Rapidfire guns that shoot several projectiles in rapid succession. Typically more accurate than the shotgun at a distance, but don't richochet, much like the shotgun\n\nGrenade lobbers: Fires an arching projectile that explodes on impact with enemies or cover, and bounces on non-platform surfaces. These are typically adequate for dealing with groups of enemies, or enemies behind cover. However, they also do friendly fire, so watch where you aim them!\n\nRocket launchers: Fires a projectile in a straight line that explodes on impact with any surface or enemy. Good for busting covers and bad bots hiding behind them, but also does firendly fire, like the grenade lobber. Don't aim it at me, you dingus!\n\nHandguns: The most basic form of weapon that just about anyone can use effectively. With their decent range, you can richochet these projectiles they fire much like with a sharpshooter, but almost never come with a laser sight. These are reliable and powerful weapons, and makes and excellent replacement for the sharp shooters that makes your crew sitting ducks in order to fire.\n\nAs you play and succeed missions, your crew gains experience and levels up, unlocking new skills and perks each level.

Three hours later, I realized I'd dropped all the stuff I was doing that evening to play juuust a liiittle bit further.\n\nIt all begins with a simple story about steambots who gotta scrape together a living. Then you're thrust into a shoot-out and you quickly grok that the way forward must be careful tactical positioning, shooting, item-using, moving, always on your toes. Then come upgrades and shops and the magic of RPG character improvement. Then come crazy environmental and weaponry diversifications + complications. And on top (literally!) of all that come the hilarious hats, and the feisty gang of steambots whom you gather and upgrade over time. There's balance here, and depth, and laugh-out-loud moments, and also many dimensions to the characters, all of the above crammed into a seemingly innocuous side-scrollingy-platformy tactical team shooter.\n\nThat's precisely the beautiful thing about [i]SteamWorld Heist[/i]; it's so tightly packed with enticing bits and at the same time so smoothly flowing that I never had the feeling I was forced into the next part of the journey. Hell, I hate procedural generation, and I still played a bunch of randomly generated ship raids 5 or 6 or 7 times just to level up my cool steambot gang! And get some exercise with my new shooty toys, of course. Because in this particular SteamWorld, you gotta remember: always aim for their hats! ;-)\n\nHappy heisting, steambot friends, and don't forget to lob the occasional grenade at an oil drum.", "timestamp_created": 1511470252, "timestamp_updated": 1511471415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37198536": {"recommendationid": "37198536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003298623", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 446, "last_played": 1515932801}, "language": "english", "review": "Often described as a 2D X-Com but to say that gives this game a disservice.

probably going to be one of those games that I bought for a good price but only play for an hour or so.\" And about an hour in, I was going to put it down.\nI am soooo glad that I didn't.\nThe story is fun. The gameplay is enjoyable. The characters, with the little that you learn about them, have so much depth and personality. The mythology, while not particularly explored, is very interesting. You have an array of different characters to choose from, and the collectible hats are a nice touch. The combat styles are varied between characters, which lets you play to your style. It's easy enough to play on normal, but it still fun to play at lower difficulties. Those who enjoy a challenge will love the hardest difficulty, and the achievement hunting.\nWould reccommend getting the Outsider DLC before you play it though, unless you intend to play multiple times. It unlocks new story missions and a cool new character.\nStory: 9/10. Music: 10/10. Sound effects: 7/10. Controls/gameplay: 10/10. Enjoyment: 9.5/10.

Worms-like combat in a single player story setting.\n\nYou unlock different characters as you advance through the game. Some use pistols and get bonuses if they hit enemies from the back, some are snipers and can ricochet bullets off walls to get headshots or hit enemies that are behind cover, some use explosives for area damage, some have more health and deal more melee damage some use close range weapons. Then you can level them up and gear them as you like to create a party fit for your play style.\n\nYou also find hats which are purely cosmetic, but it's kind of addicting to try and find them or shoot them off of enemies' heads and pick them up for yourself.\n\nThe level design is very clever, letting you approach most situations in multiple ways... except on a few occasions near the end of the game. I especially found using snipers and killing enemies with crazy trickshots using the curves and walls in the level.\n\nIt's a great game just like the first Steamworld game even though they have very little in common, mainly the aesthetics. Also recommend the Outsider DLC which includes a unique character and some new levels.\n[i] Do not miss the sale [/i]", "timestamp_created": 1511215494, "timestamp_updated": 1511215494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36651536": {"recommendationid": "36651536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021115973", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1034, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496832217}, "language": "english", "review": "ye boi", "timestamp_created": 1511203831, "timestamp_updated": 1511203831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.433168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36638669": {"recommendationid": "36638669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080753635", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511150069}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0420\u0435\u0434\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0438\u0448\u0443 \u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440\u044b, \u043d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0443 \u043e\u0442\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c. \u0413\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442 xcom, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430 2D. \u0412 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u0412 \u0438\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0435, \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0436\u0435 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0441\u0438\u0434\u044f \u0432 \u0433\u043b\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u043d\u0430\u0439\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0436\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u043c\u044f \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0443 \u043b\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0431\u043b\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0431\u043e\u0439.  \n\n\u0412 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435, \u0437\u0432\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u043e\u0442\u0435. \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044b.\n\n\u0418 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043a. \u042d\u0442\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0438 \u0432 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0447\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0447\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435.", "timestamp_created": 1511151158, "timestamp_updated": 1511151158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663805", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36633529": {"recommendationid": "36633529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026390773", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "last_played": 1515178995}, "language": "english", "review": "A true gem among indies.

[/h1]\n\nHowever, having realised as I played the game for the first time, that it wasn\u00b4t quite at all what I expected I still enjoyed the mechanics and battles. Which is all you will do.\nIt gets a bit repetetive, yes. Yet it\u00b4s charm lies in its stale sense of humor, charming graphics and ricoch\u00e9ting bullets.\n\n[b] You might remember[/b] that scene from \"Alien 4\" where Ron Perlmans character ricoch\u00e9tes a bullet?! \nWell in this game Bullets do just that, and let me tell you, it is a [b]BLAST[/b] to see your bullet bounce off a wall and hit your target.\nAlso quite like the \"VATS\" targetting system from the Fallout series. It sort of never gets old if you ask me.\n\nFor me though it wasn\u00b4t a HARD game in particular, just somewhat random in some cases, which made me a bit frustrated at points.\nLike when you do not play as a sniper and will have to rely on your IRL luck to just hope that the bullet riccoh\u00e9ts in the right path.\nUltimately, I lowered the difficulty and had an absolute blast! Since I could play around more with a litte less threatning attitude from the game.\n\nI quite liked this!\nAnd if you are a suckerfor turned-based-cowbots-in-space-games...I think you\u00b4ll have a jolly good time!\n", "timestamp_created": 1508958762, "timestamp_updated": 1508958762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35994533": {"recommendationid": "35994533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250935764", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508954644}, "language": "italian", "review": "Il gioco e molto gradevole.

The mission layouts are (mostly?) randomized so replaying a mission can still be fun.  Each mission is short so this is a good game to play when you only have 30 mins of time to spend.  Overall there is still lots of content though and it is well worth the money from that perspective.  There are lots of difficulty settings so it should be playable by almost anyone.

Although fun I didn't have any desire to play the game again (I almost never do so nothing against the game).\n\nFor negatives, the leveling and customization is quite stream-lined and basic, could be stronger but that is not what this game is going for so not really much of a negative.

It's rare that I find a turn-based strategy game I enjoy, but this is one of them. The key feature mentioned on the store page about the difficuly is quite true, as you can adjust the difficulty to make it really rough or quite easy depending on what you are after, and you can adjust the difficulty between missions, in case you find it's too tough for you, or too easy.\n\nThe gist of the game is that you're a steampunk robot space pirate with a ship. You dock with other ships, boarding them with 1-4 characters, and go through, collecting loot and shooting enemies in turn-based combat. Each character has passive and active skills, and you can take the characters you want, who have a pretty good spread of decent abilities and passives to help you make a variety of good teams. Instead of XCOM Enemy Unknown's percent-to-hit chances, SteamWorld Heist has you aim the gun yourself, lining up shots, and some guns even have laser sights and you can ricochet the bullet to pull off headshots for extra damage, or even wild trickshots to hit enemies behind cover. Some missions count down before automated turrets power up and reinforcements start showing up, but I found the game was pretty fair with the time you're given, and you can push forward to escape in time.\n\nOnce you finish a mission, you're rewarded with loot and water, which acts as money, and you can even replay missions if you want more currency and loot, which is randomized (certain loot pools per level, of course). Your characters level up and gain new passive and active abilities, and you move along to another mission. The ships you invade have procedurally generated room layouts, and unlike a lot of procedurally generated games, I found this one worked well, because the idea is to invade a ship with an unknown layout, run room to room checking for and grabbing loot and taking out enemies, and then escape. The map variations make replaying a mission less repetitive to some extent.\n\nI have not completed the game, and likely won't, but this is one of those rare games I don't care to finish but liked virtually everything in the game that I experienced.

It has character, great music, great art (that still holds up at higher resolutions), and fantastic gameplay.  It's turn based, but you actually get to aim your shots, so you can get headshots and do cool trick shots that can even bounce off surfaces (like collecting hats by shooting off their hats!).  Also when you make an awesome shot, or blow up an enemy it slows time a bit, and each hit you make actually effects the things around it (like exploding barrels, slowly breaking enemy cover, etc.). It has special abilities, cool items, lots of different weapons that actually play differently, a bunch of different characters with their own quirks.  Oh, and again, great music via Steampowered Giraffe!!!  I'm going to get the soundtrack sometime too.\n\nI loved their first game about mining, saw this very different game and worried that I would not like it (I was so wrong).

Vielleicht war es das Heist im Titel. Vielleicht fand ich das Artwork mit der Revolver tragenden Cowboy-Roboterin Piper irgendwie ansprechend. So genau ist mir das nicht mehr nachvollziehbar. Es ist vielleicht einfach der gesamte SteamWorld Heist Mix, der anspricht. Weltraum-Setting, Steampunk Roboter, \u00dcberf\u00e4lle auf Raumfrachter. Irgendwie hat diese Formel schon immer funktioniert. Von Cowboy Bebop bis zur Firefly, ist es immer ein gro\u00dfes Vergn\u00fcgen gewesen, wenn in den Tiefen des Weltraums einmal andere Geschichten erz\u00e4hlt werden, als die von Fortschritt, Erkundung und Ungewissheit. Zwar l\u00e4sst sich auch in SteamWorld Heist eine unbekannte Bedrohung bek\u00e4mpfen, die Pr\u00e4misse des Spiels aber auf der die Mechanik beruht, n\u00e4mlich das Ausrauben von Raumschiffen, durch taktische und geschickte K\u00e4mpfe, hat seinen ganz eigenen Charme.\n\nSteamWorld Heist steckt voller liebervoller Details, die durchaus einen kleinen gesellschaftskritischen Impetus mit sich bringen. Beispielsweise ist die W\u00e4hrung des Spiels nicht etwa Gold oder wie man bei Robotern vielleicht noch denken k\u00f6nnte \u00d6l oder Benzin, sondern Wasser. (macht ja auch irgendwie sinn bei der Titelgebenden SteamWorld) Damit machen Somit machen die Entwickler auf abstrakte Weise auf die Wichtigkeit von Wasser aufmerksam. Wenn sogar die Maschinen es f\u00fcr sich brauchen und klar ist Wasser ganz faktisch wichtiger als Geld oder Gold. Allein die verf\u00fcgbare Masse l\u00e4sst es im Bewusstsein der westlichen Gesellschaft in den Hintergrund r\u00fccken.\nAls eine zweite kleine Spielerei empfand ich die Namens- und Geschlechtergebung der Robotercrew. Irgendwie kommt fast die komplette Crew sehr androgyn daher. Nicht alle Namen lassen sich eindeutig einem Geschlecht zuordnen, nicht alle Gesichter lassen sich eindeutig einem Geschlecht zuordnen. Damit bricht das Spiel Geschlechterkonventionen und das ganz nebenbei, ohne dass man etwas davon mitbekommt.\nUnd ganz kurz m\u00f6chte ich auch noch die H\u00fcter erw\u00e4hnen. Vollkommen irrelevant f\u00fcrs Gameplay lassen sich H\u00fcte der Gegner herunterschie\u00dfen und aufsammeln und schlie\u00dflich beim n\u00e4chsten Heist auf die K\u00f6pfe der eigenen Crew aufsetzen. Genau so sollten Collectibles behandelt werden, nicht relevant f\u00fcrs Spiel, aber nett zu sammeln. Andere Spiele erm\u00f6glichen einen Fortschritt durch das Sammeln. Dadurch verkommt der Spieler immer h\u00e4ufiger zum Sammeler, denn es st\u00e4rkt ihn. Hier ist es einfach eine nette kleine Spielerei und nicht essentiell.\n\nIch habe das Spiel so sehr ins Herz geschlossen, dass ich es gleich zweimal durchspielte. Das Zusammenstellen der Crew und die Auswahl der verschriedenen Waffen, sowie die zufallsgenerierten Innenr\u00e4ume machen dieses kleine Spiel unglaublich Variantenreich und liebenswert!", "timestamp_created": 1507061052, "timestamp_updated": 1507061052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35451381": {"recommendationid": "35451381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029509433", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 10137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508862037}, "language": "english", "review": "Very addictive, seemingly simple game that has some surprisingly intersting stategy twist on higher difficulty. \nVery good value for the price !", "timestamp_created": 1507048647, "timestamp_updated": 1508862180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35448263": {"recommendationid": "35448263", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255372419", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 124, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501586688}, "language": "english", "review": "Adorable little game that is the right balance of difficulty and story!

The game is an absolute blast to play through; personally, I don't think there's a single thing to hate about it. \n\nWhat this game has going for it.\nThe first thing that will grab your immediate attention is how beautiful this game looks; the choice of colors in combination with the unique art direction they took all cumulated into a visually striking game that will leave you awestruck. The music is also fantastic as well, and it gives off a strong Borderlands vibe, and I wouldn't be surprised if they took it as their inspiration. Lastly, the gameplay is also enjoyable to play. As the developers describe, it feels as if you're playing XCOM but in a 2D landscape with a unique twist to turn-based strategy and likable characters. All of them have their strategy and playstyle, and it allows for a whole bunch of variations to combat ensuring that you will almost never get bored. The story is nothing spectacular, but I would be lying if I said I didn't find it charming, entertaining, and humorous. \n\nWhat I think it could have done better:\nThere are three gun classes in Steamworld Heist: Sharpshooters, Assault, and Heavy. Assault weapons are by far the most underwhelming type because it gets outperform by practically every other classes. It trades accuracy and consistency for raw damage; however, the damage that you would get in return is so minuscule that the tradeoff will never be worth it. You are better off using a regular handgun in almost any situation. Fortunately, this is my only real gripe, But, if I could add one more thing to future sequels, then having Overwatch just like in XCOM would be hugely beneficial for the players. There are countless moments where you would find yourself being engaged by enemy reinforcements, but because of circumstances staying where you are is better than actually moving away, It will always give the players something to do and remedy all of those turns where you passed doing absolutely nothing. \n\nSome advice for beginners:\nPositioning is crucial especially on higher difficulties as well as appropriate inventory management; not equipping the right gear and utilities for the appropriate characters will significantly prohibit their potential and usefulness in combat.

Steamworld Heist is essentially a 2D Xcom style game, a strategic, turn based shooter. Unlike XCOM, where you get a % chance to hit the enemy based on your position, this game forces you to actually aim your gun in the direction of the enemy. It can get difficult if you're trying to eyeball a long range shot, or a ricochet shot off the wall.\n\nThe music was immersive and often pretty tense. The art style is fun and colorful, often using steampunk and cyber-robotic art themes. The story was silly but easy to follow. The gameplay is easy to learn, but it takes a while to find your best playstyle through experimentation. All the normal shooter classes are here; Sniper, Demolition, Assault and...the general pistol shooter guy. I'll call him the Soldier class for the hell of it.\n\nI deeply enjoyed beating this game, and then going back to mop-up all the stars I missed. In order to get all the stars, you can't let a single character die during a mission, which is challenging as hell sometimes. It should be noted, permadeath is NOT in this game. If you die, that character comes back after that mission is over. It makes it for a more casual, enjoyable experience over XCOM.\n\nI played this game for 14 hours and I can't think of anything bad to say about it.

I dig what Image & Form Games seem to be doing w/ their SteamWorld IP. They built the world and the lore and are now making games in whichever genre they see fit, each w/ its own uniquely SteamWorld twist. Specifically, they are having pretty remarkable success giving games a casual, approachable sheen and then still providing deeper gameplay for those who want it. You know, cool people like us. *High five*\n\n\n2. The way they do this w/ SteamWorld Heist is to take X-COM-style turn-based combat and flip it to a 2D plane like a platformer. The change this makes is more psychological than it is practical. Really, most movement in most strategy games is only on two axes. Having those two axes match w/ the two used in Super Mario Bros. makes the whole thing seem a little more familiar.\n\n\n3. This game is probably the closest we will likely get to a game based on Joss Wheaton's Firefly. It goes as far as to subtitle the game \"You can't take the swag from me\" when the credits roll.\n\n\n4. You play as a motley crew of smuggler ro-bots. As you go about you mild mannered piracy, it is revealed that the government is up to some funny business, which you unravel to find yet more insidious machinations underneath the surface.\n\n\n5. Combat is mostly gun-based w/ some melee and ranged explosive attacks mixed in for good measure. The characters have different special abilities and can only use certain guns, making them each serve a unique potential purpose in your crew.\n\n\n6. Characters gain experience and become more powerful as the game progresses. You can replay levels as much as you want which lets you grind power-ups for your character. However, this process is pretty slow going and that encourages you to try new strategies rather than just tank up and take everything head-on.\n\n\n7. It's easy enough to just roll through w/ your initial default crew but most new characters prove useful right away because you can give them current level gear even if they're at a lower level themselves.\n\n\n8. In addition to the turn based aspect of the combat, there is an added real-time element when aiming your guns. Your hand wavers just a little bit and you have to hit the shoot button at the right moment. It turns combat into a bit of a mini-game w/o breaking flow.\n\n\n9. This was originally developed for the 3DS and its turn-based nature make it a great fit for that platform but I personally enjoyed playing on the PC simply because the larger screen really showed off the beautiful artwork. It is not pixel-art quite but does have something of a nostalgic vintage gaming tinge to it, though of course in modern resolutions.\n\n\n10. I can't say enough good the music. It's all done by Steam Powered Giraffe, who are a group that seems built from the ground up to make music for light-hearted steampunk video games. A really nice detail is the band is included in-game and is shown performing unique tracks at each of the bars you visit on the way--complete w/ vocals. You can buy the SteamWorld Heist sountrack off their Bandcamp page and you should.\n\n\n11. Difficulty is adjustable before each mission and it does more than just give the enemies more less hit-points or add or subtract enemies from the game. Upping the difficulty changes the strategy you will have to use to beat each level. You have to leverage your team's strengths much better on higher difficulties because most levels have additional waves of enemies that come after a countdown and those can be pretty beastly as they get more powerful. For what it's worth, the default difficulty, \"experienced,\" is well-chosen as it allows you to play somewhat carefully, make some mistakes and still win. It gives you a stiff punishment for failing but not one that will ever become insurmountable.\n\n\n12. Most of the replayability here is going to come from either wanting to try higher difficulties or play through w/ different combinations of ro-bot combatants. To this end, it offers an new game+ mode that allows you to use all additional characters you acquire on your first play from the very beginning of the next.\n\n\n13. This game is what I would describe as deceptively good and can really provide a lot of things to a lot of people. You can knock the difficulty down and get a pretty, light game to spend some spare clock cycles when you have an extra moment or you can dig in and get some pretty dense strategy going--and SteamWorld Heist is actually good for both.", "timestamp_created": 1506352841, "timestamp_updated": 1506352841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35201287": {"recommendationid": "35201287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028085610", "num_games_owned": 797, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513194042}, "language": "italian", "review": "xcom in a nutshell, just fantastic!", "timestamp_created": 1506340783, "timestamp_updated": 1506340783, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35166729": {"recommendationid": "35166729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062227881", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 164, "playtime_forever": 576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506392549}, "language": "english", "review": "I shot a robot's hat off and took it from him and then his friend shot it off and then I killed him for doing what i did to his friend.\n\n10/10 our robot future is blessed", "timestamp_created": 1506211229, "timestamp_updated": 1506211229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35158427": {"recommendationid": "35158427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043259425", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506201262}, "language": "english", "review": "Robo-Firefly!", "timestamp_created": 1506185156, "timestamp_updated": 1506185156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35157791": {"recommendationid": "35157791", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972348026", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1011, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498387150}, "language": "english", "review": "Slick and to-the-point tactical team shooting, looting game.

Sadly, the game didn't recognize my first playthrough as Elite Playthrough because at the very start i selected \"Experienced\", played the tutorial in \"Experienced\", but after that selecting \"Elite\" for the first mission and never changed it back. Is it really supposed not to count as Elite playthrough just because you selected the wrong difficulty for the darn tutorial?!? That should be really changed.\n\nOther than that, if you like games like X-Com, give this one a try. Putting a slight skill element where usually randomness decides if you hit or not is really a nice concept that made this game a lot less frustrating (and probably easier) than X-Com and similar games.

Think: XCom as a side-scroller, with the projectile trajectories of Worms and the story of Firefly.\n\nBasically, you play as a band of smugglers (\"Cowbots\") who give up their life of crime to, well, save the world! The gameplay takes the form of a series of maps, some of which are shops or neutral bars, but most of which are combat maps. To complete these you must fulfill an objective such as 'Collect all swag' or 'Disable generators' or 'Kill the boss' or something similiarly straight-forward. You get a 3 or 4 star rating for completing the objectives & collecting the epic swag, without losing any steambots. To do this, you can field anywhere from 1 to 4 cowbots who have a regular weapon attack and a couple extra abilities, either from their class or from equippable utilities.\n\n[h1]Are the base game mechanics fun?[/h1]\n\nThe most important question! Yes the game is fun to play.\n\nBecause you're making skill-shots, the game demands (and rewards) careful positioning and attention, and you're constantly having to make tactical decisions about whether to move and shoot - or sprint for a superior position, perhaps behind some nice cover.\n\nWhat's more, the game has a decent variety of map-types. In some maps, you might have to defend a central room and stay alive for X turns. Others are timed affairs, in which you only have 15 turns before the ship explodes. Others are 1-bot commando-style affairs.\n\nFurthermore, the game is very well-paced. In the likes of XCom, if you advance too swiftly, you might alert too many pods than you can handle. Here, however, you pretty much decide when to open the next door. But that doesn't mean you can just take it easy! Most maps have a countdown and as you spend your turns, reinforcements will arrive and turrets will start to come online to make your job tougher. It's enough to keep the edge on - but not so crazy that playing the game becomes too stressful.\n\n[h1]How's the story?[/h1]\n\nIt's not compelling in its own right as something like the Witcher series, but then, so few games are. It does well to provide context and motivation for why you're doing stuff. As I said before, it clearly takes its direction from Firefly, including some clear allusions (e.g. \"You can't take the swag from me\").\n\n[h1]What difficulty should I play on?[/h1]\n\nThe game offers a good variety of difficulties: Beginner, Normal, Experienced, Veteran, & Elite.\n\nTo give some context, I beat XCom 1 on Ironman Classic & XCom 2 on Ironman Commander. I decided to play Steamworld Heist on Veteran. It was a good fit. On the roughly ~40 or 50 maps, I got max stars 85% on my first try. I had 9 failures, including 4 on one map. I had a couple rage moments - but most of them were my fault, for being too impatient when making shots. I played maybe 5 or 6 repeat missions to level up some of my alternative characters.\n\nGiven this, I don't think anyone should play Beginner. Probably too easy. Normal would be for those who are bad at tactics games or really want to take it easy. Experienced is probably equivalent to 'normal.' Veteran is good for those who are experienced at these games. Elite will require multiple attempts on some maps and perhaps some grinding.\n\n[h1]Anything else?[/h1]\n\nI was pleased to find so many songs with vocals. I was doubly pleased to discover that Steam Powered Giraffe, a rather well-regarded geek band you can find at the likes of, say, Dragoncon, had done Steamworld Heist's soundtrack. Their sound is unique and unapologetically geeky and added a lot to the game. Do yourself a favor and listen to a few songs from the soundtrack.\n\n[h1]Summary:[/h1]\n\nGreat game.

Do you like guns? Better yet, do you like robots shooting guns? If so, Steamworld Heist is for you. \n\nThe story of Steamworld Heist is simple: You play as Piper Faraday, who is what's known as a steambot. After losing all but two memebers of your crew, you must go on a quest to build new crew and collect tons of treasure. But watch out! Along the way you'll run into a myriad of baddies that you and your crew will have to deal with. Ranging from scrappers to imperials, to even aliens, there's never a lack of things to shoot.\n\nThe gameplay is in the style of a 2d turn-based shoot-em-up sidescoller. At first, you may say: \"But PotPi, that just sounds like insanity!\". You'd be correct in this assumption. However, there is a method to the madness. Once you learn what crew members use which weapons and utilities, and how to richochet the bullets correctly, it becomes much easier. Each crew member has 4 slots: One for a firearms (the shooty thing), two for utilities (the powerup and healing things), and one slot for a hat (the head thing). Weapons, utilities, and some hats can be found or bought with in-game currency called Gallons.\n\nHats are cool. You can buy some of them in shops, but those aren't the cool ones. The cool ones are retrieved by shooting them off of the heads of your enemies and stealing them from their lifeless corpses. Some hats are more rare than other, so keep an eye out for the good ones! :D\n\nPros: \n1. Easy to grasp gameplay that still has depth for experienced players\n2. Many crew members to choose from (10 total, I believe)\n3. Customization is almost limitless with the combinations of weapons, ultilities, and 100 bajillion hats\n\nCons:\n1. Story could be a bit more fleshed out, but the gameplay makes up for it\n2. Don't play Elite difficulty. Just don't.\n\nOverall, this game was well worth the $4.99 I spent on it during the summer sale, and I'd say it's still worth $14.99 when not on sale.\n\n8.8/10", "timestamp_created": 1504405244, "timestamp_updated": 1505093731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34697215": {"recommendationid": "34697215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069790649", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504197083}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ta guay.", "timestamp_created": 1504392573, "timestamp_updated": 1504392573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34685556": {"recommendationid": "34685556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020430348", "num_games_owned": 401, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504359795}, "language": "english", "review": "Surprise, this game is awesome !", "timestamp_created": 1504359867, "timestamp_updated": 1504359867, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493827", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34684201": {"recommendationid": "34684201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245157320", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507198830}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.", "timestamp_created": 1504355983, "timestamp_updated": 1504355983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493827", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34677379": {"recommendationid": "34677379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207946015", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498274757}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun in short bursts no replayablilty, a shitty timer mechanic, get other games before this one, but its ok, loved the shooting mechanic,", "timestamp_created": 1504332920, "timestamp_updated": 1504332920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34672564": {"recommendationid": "34672564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285528106", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514650463}, "language": "english", "review": "great stradigy game", "timestamp_created": 1504311785, "timestamp_updated": 1504311785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493827", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34671382": {"recommendationid": "34671382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031525163", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504366230}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Habiendo jugado a SteamWorld Dig, ten\u00eda ganas de probar su secuela no directa. Y aunque solo comparten universo, la verdad es que SteamWorld Heist me ha gustado mucho.\n\nJugando la campa\u00f1a directamente en dif\u00edcil, puedo decir que no es un juego complicado, aunque penaliza el ir sin cuidado y los errores tontos como cualquier tactics. \nLo mejor, el toque de acci\u00f3n de los tiroteos y los rebotes de las balas. Llega a ser muy satisfactorio alcanzar a un enemigo con un rebote bien calculado y una moderada dosis de suerte.\n\nLa jugabilidad es muy buena, yo he jugado con mando (Xbox One) y me ha resultado muy c\u00f3modo adaptarme a los controles. Todo resulta intuitivo y responde estupendamente.\n\nLas misiones y los enemigos son lo suficientemente variados como para resultar siempre entretenidos. Los mapas se generan de forma aleatoria, y aunque me ha ocurrido, ha en un par de escasas ocasiones en las que se ha generado una situaci\u00f3n injustamente peliaguda. Normalmente, funciona muy bien.\n\nLos gr\u00e1ficos son excelentes, con un estilo art\u00edstico sobresaliente, colorido y vibrante. Los efectos especiales a\u00f1aden impacto a las armas, que resultan francamente satisfactorias de usar.\nLa m\u00fasica y los efectos sonoros est\u00e1n a la altura del apartado gr\u00e1fico, y aunque el country no es mi g\u00e9nero favorito, las baladas cantadas son interesantes. Si te gustan de verdad, te recomiendo que pilles la B.S.O.\n\nLa mec\u00e1nica de los sombreros es entretenida y aunque es puramente est\u00e9tica, pica lo suficiente como para intentar hacerse con todos esos sombreros raros que aparecen por el juego. Una adici\u00f3n interesante, que le da color al juego, y es totalmente opcional (excepto quiz\u00e1s para los logros).\n\nEn resumen, SteamWorld Heist es un excelente juego no solo para los amantes de los tactics, sino que lo recomiendo tambi\u00e9n a aquellos y aquellas que deseen dar sus primeros pasos por el g\u00e9nero. Resulta accesible y muy divertido. 100% recomendable.\nY si no lo hab\u00e9is probado, SteamWorld Dig es otro gran juego.\n\nPD: escribo este an\u00e1lisis sin haber comprado el DLC. He quedado satisfecho con el contenido b\u00e1sico del juego (que no es poco) a falta de conseguir las cuatro \u00faltimas estrellas.

If you\u2019ve played Steamworld Dig (you should, it\u2019s pretty fun), Steamworld Heist is completely different in terms of gameplay, but the graphics/storytelling are similar. I think the 2 games may actually take place in the same \u201cuniverse\u201d but the stories don\u2019t overlap so you can play one without playing the other and not miss out on any important plot points.\n\nThe story follows a group of pirate steam bots (robots that run on water/steam) some time after the destruction of Earth, as they fly around on their rickety space ship hijacking other space bots to steal their water. Water is the \u201cmoney\u201d of the game and you can use it to purchase weapons/items/hats in numerous shops found throughout the game. However, the best stuff is usually found as loot during missions. All the gear has tiers, for example tier 2 is better than tier 1, and when you find a gun during a mission, often it\u2019s a higher tier than you can currently buy. The game allows you to replay missions over and over for water and loot, so you can grind endlessly to level up or equip yourself for difficult missions (one boss in particular is a nighmare). \n\nDuring each mission, you control between 1 and 4 of your steam bots (each of your bots has unique skills) in horizontal/vertical scrolling levels where you fight varying numbers of enemies in turn based combat. Generally speaking enemies die in 1-3 shots, but like the Worms games, you need to aim your gun yourself, so there is at least some skill involved. As with most turn based games, you should take care to kill enemies during your turn rather than leave several with partial health (killing 1 enemy while leaving 3 undamaged is better than leaving all 4 near death). \n\nIn terms of inventory management, each of your bots has a slot for a weapon, 2 slots for items such as repair kits or armor, and 1 slot for a hat (purely cosmetic). Most of the enemies you fight are wearing hats that you can blast off (\u201cwasting\u201d a turn because knocking off a hat does no damage) and you can collect the hat for your own future use. Most of the hats are common (enemies of the same type almost always wear the same hat) but there are a few \u201crare\u201d hats that you see once every 100 enemies or so. These are usually the hats that are tied with Steam achievements, and can take hours and hours to collect.\n\nReasons to play Steamworld Heist:\n+You enjoyed Steamworld Dig, especially the art design and music sound track.\n+You like turn based strategy but don\u2019t want to play \u201chardcore\u201d games. XCom was too difficult for my liking, so something more casual like this fit me well.\n+You have a low end computer but still want to play something fun/relaxing in short bursts (30 min to 1 hour at a time) for a long time. The campaign took me over 15 hours to complete (because I went out of my way to level up my bots), and the game is not demanding in terms of hard drive space or other system requirements.\n\nReasons NOT to play:\n-You\u2019re looking for a real challenge (like XCom Iron Man Mode) and not a casual game\n-You want super modern graphics (this game looks hand drawn, sort of charmingly cartoony)\n-You really care about your Steam achievement completion %. If you don\u2019t own the DLC for this game (I don\u2019t) you can\u2019t \u201ceasily\u201d get more than 60% of the achievements without a great deal of grinding for hats. When they say a hat is rare, they mean REALLY rare. \n\nOverall the game is great fun and you may already own it from the $1 tier of a Humble bundle. Lucky you because Steamworld Heist is definitely worth playing in my opinion. \n", "timestamp_created": 1504196486, "timestamp_updated": 1504196486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647926", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34635595": {"recommendationid": "34635595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176492373", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504023002}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego corto viciante al principio y pesado al final, dificil hasta en modo facil, y ramdom en algunsa ocasiones.

For the third installment in Steamworld series, the devs have been doing a great job at making very fun and addicting games. I liked Steamworld Dig because it was very relaxing and was reminiscent to Super Motherload, which is a game I adore. I was surprised that their next game was once again completely different in every way despite being a direct sequel. By tackling this genre in their own steampunk fashion, they struck gold yet again. \n\nSteamworld Heist's gameplay is essentially a 2d XCOM. There is no base management or perma-death, but the similarites come from the combat and character classes. Gameplay is also similar to Worms in terms of using your aiming skills to line up shots and bounce grenades. With the added effect of ricocheting bullets to kill your targets hiding in cover, it all makes for a very satisfying experience. Each character has 2 action points per turn which you can use to move or attack. Each character also has their own set of specific weapons and abilities. Leveling up unlocks more skills for that character. Mixing and matching your team is crucial for each battle. You can earn money from pickups to buy more weapons and items from shops, which can be accessed via the world map. There are also TONS of hats to collect and wear, usually earned by shooting off the enemies head with precision aiming, which is very rewarding.\n\nAll the characters are extremely likeable. You get to learn more details about your crew in between missions with some added quirky humor. This connection with your team really builds up and adds development to make them memorable.

In this case, you are a group of robots pulled into a scheme to save the universe (or at least get the heat off your own backs). you play through procedural generated levels trying to gather as much loot as possible, grab the big box, and get off the ship while killing any robots that get in your way. You level up your robots and gather loot, allowing you to increase in strength.\n\nThis game is a perfect example of when NOT to use procedural level generation. As a heist game, you should seek to prepare a plan ahead of time, choosing the best robots from your group for the task, and implement a carefully crafted plan.  However, the randomness of the levels means, if you fail the first time, you cannot plan for the next time as everything from the layout of the ship to the enemies you might face will be completely different. Essentially, you load up your highest level robots with your best gear and bash away hoping that you get a lucky draw on the level. At one point, I had planned out a level, sending my tanks to hold off the enemies while I sent my fast guy to deal with the objective, a destructible object that, for the past three goes, had not had an enemy in the room. Of course, this time the room had a very durable, high damage enemy causing my quick robot to die and force me to move back one of my other robots leaving a hole in my defenses and causing me to lose the level. I realized at this point that planning was futile and I had to hope the dice rolled in my favor. \n\nThis type of rogue-like levels wouldn't be so bad if you either gained something from lost levels or simply were thrown back in. Sadly, the designers decided to punish you for your bad luck with a loss of in-game money with every loss and no experience or loot. Meaning that if you hit a brick wall level that is too far above you, you must grind past levels until you stand a chance or get a lucky break. \n\nI don't recommend buying this if you want a solid turn-based tactics or heist game as it is a poor example of either. If you like grinding and luck-based gameplay, I suppose you could do worse than this game.

It's a party-based, turn-based title that reminds many of a 2D X-Com: Enemy Unknown. However, in Steamworld Heist, there's no researching, building bases, or selecting abilities. You either find items outright or currency used to buy them, and your characters gain abilities automatically when they level. The player decides which weapon classes are their favorites, and then takes characters into battle that can use those weapons and have complementing supporting abilities. Personally, I was a fan of sharpshooter class weapons (some of the most satisfying moments in the game involve bouncing bullets off of walls to hit enemies in cover), shotguns, and missile launchers.\n\nAlthough in some ways Steamworld Heist is simpler than XCOM: EU, I actually found that I didn't miss the base-building or research elements. The only thing I can think of that might make this title better would be a little more focus on the backstories of the different robots you've recruited. The bottom line is that it's a lot of fun to take a crew equipped with your favorite weapons into a ship and slowly dismantle all the enemies by making accurate shots and taking advantage of explosives, holes in cover, etc.", "timestamp_created": 1501775474, "timestamp_updated": 1501775474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33994516": {"recommendationid": "33994516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030646348", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 2399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501773309}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I've ever played.

I could rant about how much I adore this game (or the kickass dev's) for hours but I\u2019ll try keep it brief.\n\nStory - What can I say about this, it\u2019s not too complex and you don\u2019t need to play the previous Steam World game so you can jump right into this one (though I would recommend playing Steam World Dig as well as it is quite a fun game), You are basically just a Robot Space Pirate who has had enough shit so it\u2019s time to take down whoever really pisses you off e.g. an entire Space Robot Government. Granted it is kind of straightforward and could be more fleshed out but hey for what the game is it works quite well. (7/10)\n\nGameplay \u2013 At times yes, the gameplay can be difficult and yeah, a little bit repetitive but hey, that\u2019s possibly just cause I\u2019m not too good at games like this. One big issue I do have with this game is the Inventory management as it is quite harsh and you absolutely will have to get rid of a useful item here and there to make room. The straightforward combat is very pleasing and satisfying and feels just like a western shootout\u2026 well most of the time at least. (8/10)\n\nCharacters \u2013 Oh man\u2026 I adore almost all of these characters so much (not you Sally Bolt) They all have vastly varying skills, designs and backstories and I found myself always grinding to have all crew members around the same level so I can swap them out depending on the mission (Though I usually use a crew consisting of my favs Piper, Sea Brass and my main girl Fen.) (10/10)\n\nSoundtrack \u2013 MmmMMmMMmmMMm Good shit, the ambient backing tracks go from creating a great feel for the coldness and emptiness of space all the way to the excitement of battle, then there\u2019s the vocal soundtrack created and performed by the band Steam Powered Giraffe. Them creating the soundtrack is how I found this game and oh MAN I am glad they did, the feel of their music is great and it fits so well and oh man that Main theme is dope as fuck. (9/10)\n\nAll up this game is super enjoyable and is really good because you can just jump in play a few levels and jump out or you could play for hours, the addition of the DLC is fun and I literally cannot use the Character from it (Fen) she is just too fun to play as. So as a conclusion I would say definitely get this game if you are remotely interested in Robots, Steampunk, Space or Turn Based Shooters.\n \n 8.5/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1501719940, "timestamp_updated": 1501719940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33955819": {"recommendationid": "33955819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009654132", "num_games_owned": 1703, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 1239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501614736}, "language": "english", "review": "SteamWorld Heist is a turn-based/worms-like combat/strategy/rpg with rogue-like elements.

Quell'indie col robot che scava. \nEcco, scordatevelo perch\u00e9 Heist non c'entra un tubo, almeno come gameplay.\n\nPur prendendola larga, \u00e8 ambientato nello stesso universo narrativo di Dig con rimandi pi\u00f9 o meno evidenti, ma qui seguiamo le vicende di Piper, un'intrepida robottina a capo di una piccola astronave con la quale fa scorribande in lungo e in largo attorno a ci\u00f2 che rimane della Terra (rip), saccheggiando astronavi di altre fazioni di canaglie spaziali. A lei si aggregano presto un nutrito gruppo di ribelli, reclutabili via via, e tutti assieme si imbarcheranno in un'avventura per risollevare le sorti dell'umana stirpe (cit.).\n\nInvece di essere un breve platform/\"simulatore di arricchimento tramite picconate\" o in qualunque altro genere vogliate inquadrare Dig, Heist \u00e8 invece uno strategico 2D sparacchino pi\u00f9 dalle parti di X-COM, in cui a ogni turno dobbiamo decidere attentamente come muovere i personaggi, se farli sparare, riparare dietro qualche barriera o usare un oggetto, ma con un'importante differenza: mettere a segno o meno i colpi non dipende da fantasiose e improbabili percentuali sulle quali bestemmiare e farci i meme, bens\u00ec dalla nostra mira vera e propria. \nMolte armi hanno infatti un mirino incorporato che - pur ondeggiando, altrimenti \u00e8 troppo facile - mostra la traiettoria del proiettile, per cui ci si deve spesso ingegnare con millimetrici rimbalzi sui muri per colpire il nemico alle spalle o alla testa. \n\nLa parte ruolistica gioca un ruolo importante in questa struttura: in ogni missione si possono portare 1-4 personaggi, ognuno con 3 slot per gli oggetti e le sue skill specifiche sbloccabili salendo di livello, capace di impugnare un tipo o l'altro di arma e in grado di muoversi di un certo numero di caselle. Vi sono armi da cecchino (col mirino), da mischia, a corto raggio, pesanti (che fanno danni ad area) e una mezza infinit\u00e0 di oggetti da comprare o trovare quali armature, granate, medikit, jetpack e quant'altro permetta di sopravvivere pi\u00f9 a lungo o di dare vita a tattiche specifiche. \n\nOgni livello (generato semi-casualmente) ha un obiettivo specifico, che va dall'eliminare tutti i nemici alla raccolta del bottino, ma sono presenti anche alcuni boss piuttosto impegnativi. Oltre a un tesoro dal contenuto fisso e unico, il resto del bottino consiste in un certo numero di sacchi sparsi in giro, che al termine della missione possono conferire galloni d'acqua (la valuta del gioco da spendere nei negozi), equipaggiamento non comune oppure raro, ovviamente il pi\u00f9 utile e difficile da trovare.\n\nLa trama mantiene pi\u00f9 o meno la stessa idea di base di Dig ma \u00e8 senz'altro pi\u00f9 lunga, sulle 10 ore. Ci sono poi 5 diversi livelli di difficolt\u00e0, missioni sfida e un sistema di valutazione finale con le solite stelline d'oro, che incentiva a rigiocarlo pi\u00f9 volte anche alla difficolt\u00e0 pi\u00f9 alta, dove \u00e8 s\u00ec impegnativo ma neanche troppo sleale. \nMenzione a parte per la raccolta di cappelli, grande classico che non dovrebbe mancare in nessun gioco: oltre a comprarli in appositi negozi, si troveranno raramente in testa alle varie tipologie di nemici e una volta colpiti con attenzione per farli volare via, si potranno raccogliere, collezionare ed equipaggiare sui nostri robot. Come farne a meno? \n\nHeist non \u00e8 per\u00f2 esente da alcuni minimi difetti che almeno la prima volta mi hanno dato un po' fastidio: uno \u00e8 la gestione dell'inventario, non troppo intuitiva e un po' caotica, con la possibilit\u00e0 di equipaggiare gli oggetti solo all'inizio di ogni missione e che vengono rimossi se dati a un altro personaggio. \nSecondo, una certa tendenza in una buona met\u00e0 dei livelli a far partire subito l'allarme (con conseguenti rinforzi), che costringe a fare le cose di fretta per non venir sommersi da nemici/torrette e soprattutto a sperare che, nella casualit\u00e0 del tutto, non spawnino in posizioni sfavorevoli e non vadano a chiudere all'istante un ignaro personaggio che aveva come unica colpa quella di trovarsi nel posto sbagliato senza saperlo. In questi casi la tattica va un po' a farsi benedire, e avrei preferito la prevalenza di un approccio pi\u00f9 calmo e ragionato. \n\nAnche la grafica \u00e8 sostanzialmente la stessa di Dig, con un adorabile stile western/steampunk e un ottimo design dei personaggi/nemici e delle ambientazioni, mentre la colonna sonora \u00e8 affidata agli Steam Powered Giraffe, gruppo folk-rock composto da tre tizi squinternati che nessuno ha mai sentito, ma che ha realizzato dei brani cantati (nei vari bar o dopo gli scontri coi boss) cos\u00ec belli ed azzeccati che sono quasi invogliato a comprargliela. \n\nIn buona sostanza Heist \u00e8 un titolo dal gameplay estremamente solido e divertente, ma soprattutto la dimostrazione che gli sviluppatori sono senz'altro maturati dal pur buono ma ancora semplicistico Dig, riuscendo a passare per due generi cos\u00ec diversi senza problemi e alzando nel contempo anche la complessit\u00e0 e la qualit\u00e0 delle loro produzioni. \n", "timestamp_created": 1501352989, "timestamp_updated": 1501352989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619497", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33867122": {"recommendationid": "33867122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198892301", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3072, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505861521}, "language": "english", "review": "Really nice game, good characters & skills, simple but fun game mechanics, interesting items, challenging but fair level design.\nAlso, there's a lot of hats...and they serve no purpose at all.

That puzzles me a bit. While I'll add my thumbs up I don't see this game being much more than decent. It's certainly not one that I'm likely to gush over. \n\nSteamworld Heist is a turn based game where you go from mission to mission (which so far have just been randomly generated ships) and flight aka worms style combat. You move, fire and then watch the other side take their turn. Repeat ad nasuem. Eliminate the enemies and you move on. If you don't, well...more on that later. \n\nThe positives, and the reasons I'm giving it a thumbs up, are that the game works, has a solidly-built premise and decent mechanics. The art style is unique though in motion I find it less charming than in the screenshots. The firing and aiming mechanic is fairly well done and creates a sense of skill (that I may not possess). The game has been solid without any bugs after 4 hours of gameplay.\n\nOkay, so why the tepid recommendation?\n\n1. I hate the sounds and the music. These are not the types of things that usually bother me but in Steamworld Heist I really despise both of them. The sounds are mechanical like \"grunts\" and I find them just annoying to the point that I'm skipping as much dialog as I can so I don't have to hear it. If there's supposed to be something interesting in the dialog I'm missing it because I don't want to hear the GRUNT BOOP GRUNT character noises.\n\nThe music...well, it was so bad that I finally turned it off. It's like fingernails down the blackboard to me. I can't remember the last time I had to turn off the music for a game but in this case their sound designer and I are on polar opposite pages. \n\n2. It's punitive. Fail a mission and you have to give up about half your \"water\" (money). The layouts are randomized and I've run across a couple that were a bit unfair. It's not really fun to have most of your stuff wiped away because you ran into a bad layout. I freely admit that I'm not very good at this game but I shouldn't be forced to play on casual just to continue the game. The same goes for missions where there's an alert in \"X\" turns. I've run into many missions where the ship layout simply won't allow that to happen. So I keep getting respawning enemies behind me because...why?\n\n3. It's repetitive. In fact, it's grindy. You do the same thing mission after mission, ship after ship. With no overarching meta game and a story I couldn't care less about, the game is reduced to just one combat mission after another with no break. I'm fairly bored after 4 hours and I'm just now getting to the second area. I held out hope that this would be different and got into the area and....not really. New enemies. Same exact gameplay mechanic.\n\n4.  Frankly, I'm not very good at this and don't really like the aiming mechanic. Your robots' hands sway as they aim and this makes lining up that perfect angle frustrating. My twitch reflexes aren't what they once were due to age (arthritis sucks, folks) and that makes this game overly challenging for me.

La gran protagonista es la capitana Piper Faraday, una steambot (robot a vapor) que desert\u00f3 hace un tiempo del ej\u00e9rcito real y ahora viaja por el espacio en su nave en busca de galones de agua, el bien m\u00e1s preciado de la galaxia ya que es lo que hace funcionar a los steambots y al resto de tecnolog\u00eda de esta sociedad steampunk. Es un mundo habitado por robots con consciencia propia, en el que la Tierra vol\u00f3 en pedazos y la vida rob\u00f3tica se ha establecido en el espacio.\n\nA lo largo de la aventura vamos ampliando la tripulaci\u00f3n de Piper con personajes jugables que nos encontramos en bares especiales entre misi\u00f3n y misi\u00f3n. Algunos de ellos se nos unen sin pedir nada a cambio mientras que otros lo hacen a cambio de cierta cantidad de galones de agua (que act\u00faan como moneda en el mundo del juego), y algunos s\u00f3lo nos acompa\u00f1an si hemos reunido la reputaci\u00f3n suficiente (nuestra reputaci\u00f3n depende de los resultados que obtenemos en las misiones).\n\nDisparos t\u00e1cticos\nSteamWorld Heist es un juego de estrategia por turnos con jugabilidad 2D lateral, con elementos de acci\u00f3n shooter. Las misiones de desarrollan en las naves enemigas que abordamos, las cuales (al igual que la mina de Dig) se generan aleatoriamente y con una distribuci\u00f3n de elementos diferente en cada partida (un gran punto a favor de su valor rejugable). Dependiendo de la misi\u00f3n, participan entre uno y cuatro de los miembros que escojamos de nuestra tripulaci\u00f3n.\n\nControlamos por turnos a nuestros steambots, que consiguen experiencia al completar misiones y aprenden distintas habilidades cada uno al subir niveles. Podemos moverlos varios pasos y a continuaci\u00f3n disparar, o desplazarlos un poco m\u00e1s lejos y acabar el turno sin atacar (hay numerosos puntos de cobertura en forma de barriles y otros elementos). Si nos colocamos justo al lado de un enemigo, tambi\u00e9n podemos atacarle con los pu\u00f1os de nuestro steambot (hay personajes mejores que otros en el cuerpo a cuerpo; la mayor\u00eda de ellos son capaces de hacer m\u00e1s da\u00f1o disparando pero hay uno que es m\u00e1s efectivo repartiendo \"hostias\").\n\nUno de los aspectos que m\u00e1s juego dan es que los disparos rebotan en las paredes y techos, y nuestra punter\u00eda es fundamental para acertar en los enemigos. Hay tambi\u00e9n armas que incluyen una mirilla l\u00e1ser, lo cual nos facilita esta labor, aunque s\u00f3lo ciertos personajes pueden sostener cada tipo de arma. Y no s\u00f3lo podemos equiparles con armas: tambi\u00e9n con otros objetos que potencian algunas de sus caracter\u00edsticas (como por ejemplo la salud y el movimiento), e incluso sombreros para definir un poco el aspecto de cada uno a nuestro gusto. Encontrar estos botines a lo largo de los niveles es parte de la gracia.\n\nUna aventura en el espacio\nLa aventura se divide en varias partes, y en cada una nos enfrentamos a una amenaza diferente. Empezamos luchando contra los \"scrappers\", unos locos y horrendos robots construidos con las partes de steambots muertos. A continuaci\u00f3n debemos hacer frente a los mon\u00e1rquicos, robots avanzados que funcionan con carburantes di\u00e9sel y que rinden pleites\u00eda al gobierno cruel y autoritario de la reina. Y tambi\u00e9n hay cierta fuerza desconocida en el universo a la que debemos enfrentarnos... pero eso ya lo descubrir\u00e9is vosotros. Cada uno de estos extensos segmentos (que est\u00e1n divididos en un buen n\u00famero de niveles) finaliza con un \u00e9pico y emocionante combate contra un jefe.\n\nEstrategia \u00e1gil y divertid\u00edsima en un juego con una buena duraci\u00f3n y muy rejugable. \n\nNota: 9,5/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1500511078, "timestamp_updated": 1500511078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.741380", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33661300": {"recommendationid": "33661300", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999461808", "num_games_owned": 425, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500505563}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll be in my bunk", "timestamp_created": 1500505764, "timestamp_updated": 1500505764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496211", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33655895": {"recommendationid": "33655895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119975015", "num_games_owned": 276, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 537, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500485822}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy bueno.", "timestamp_created": 1500485896, "timestamp_updated": 1500485896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33650780": {"recommendationid": "33650780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260032864", "num_games_owned": 463, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498514400}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun, hard and sometimes bullshit, but at the end, I looked back and thought... \n\nI wonder how many hats I missed", "timestamp_created": 1500468636, "timestamp_updated": 1500468636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33649197": {"recommendationid": "33649197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211004372", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500461468}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me ha sorprendido.\nUn juego casual que es bastante entretenido.

What's cool is the difficulty doesn't change your stats, just the AI.  This makes it very easy for you play through on difficulty 5, pass the controller off to your kids and replay the mission right after at difficulty 1 and have different fun experience.  You gain experience and loot everytime you play a mission, so if ever want to level up some different characters or try earning some cool loot there's a lot of replay to this game.\n\nCons:\nThis game is short.  I beat it my first time in 15 hours, but that was me replaying a lot of levels so I could get all 7 characters up to level 10.  If you're an experienced gamer and only play the 3-4 characters you really like, you can easily beat this game is under 9 hours.  My kids have played for about 5 hours and haven't beated 5 missions.\n\nThere's an exploit where if you miss your shot, you can quit to main menu, load the game up again, and it starts you at the beginning of the round again.  Great if your kid decides to randomly jump in your lap, bad if you miss your shot and feel like cheating (done it for both reasons!) \n\nNear the end the prices of weapons gets a little silly.  Really this is a result of the earned currency not keeping up with outside prices.  For example in the first map you can usually buy new weapon after 1-2 missions, in the third map unless you sell loot, it can be 4-5 missions for the same result.  This is almost a moot point since you randomly gain 2-3 great pieces of gear per mission.  \n\nPros:\nI beat the game and I want to play it some more.  \n\nI picked it up really cheap (around $10), and I've gotten 20+ hours of entertainment from it (with more to come)\n\nWhen you beat the game it unlocks New Game mode, where you can try it all again (no equipment) with your characters unlocked and at their current level.\n\nThere's 3 sectors, with 10+ locations per sector, great art style, and slightly different tricks to learn in each section.\n\nI can play it with my kids, and have us all entertained.  \n\nConclusion:\nGames great!

Along the way you'll steal weapons, gallons (the game's currency) and swag (hats :D) and go from simply being a petty pirate trying to get by to getting involved in things of greater consequence. \n\nThe story isn't anything to write home about. It is fairly par for the course and incredibly predictable. However, it's the rest of the game where Steamworld shines. \n\nThe game has an incredibly interesting visual style to it that expands on Image and Form's previous game Steamworld Dig. The rusted disgusting junker ships through to the highly advanced ships all have distinctive small details that make them visually striking to look at despite simply being a backdrop to the actual game. The game's score is also quite good featuring tracks that feel thematically appropriate for each environment and scenario encountered throughout the game. \n\nThe thing that really got me though was how Steamworld does combat. It's turn based, as previously mentioned, and allows for bullets to ricochet off of surfaces. This allows for a number of trick shots where you can hit an enemy beyond cover by bouncing a shot off of the ceiling or the wall behind them. However, only the sniper weapons will show you exactly where your shot is going. For some people not being able to see exactly where your bullet will go with the vast majority of the weapons will be an annoyance, but I found it really added to the game. It turned what would have been a calculated shot with a clear trajectory into an interesting mechanics whereby the player has to learn how each gun type fires and improve their own skill at aiming and firing the weapon to achieve the results they want. It adds an element of skill and learning to the game where it wouldn't have been otherwise and I found it really gratifying to pull of amazing trick, or clutch shots without what is ostensibly aim assist. To me this was the strongest element to Steamworld Heist and it turned what would have otherwise been a good looking and average strategy game into a fun and interesting experience.", "timestamp_created": 1499752836, "timestamp_updated": 1499752836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33447605": {"recommendationid": "33447605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020579687", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495850002}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a solid game, there aren't any unfinished bits to it and the whole package is well put together.\n\nThat said...\n\n[list]\n[*]It's NOT open-world.

A pros and cons list has been done to death in other people's reviews, so I'll leave some parting remarks now I've completed the main questline missions. \n\n Firstly, playing with a controller is recommended by both the game and myself. I used KB+M throughout and got annoyed a few misclicks I made, however the controls are still very agreeable. \n\n Secondly, collecting loot for random weapons and utilities is fun but perhaps suffers from a lack of variation or real true uniqueness. There's also the issue of just hoping to randomly get the next weapon tier for your favourite bot. If you're unlucky you may not use said bot/s for a few missions until you get them or will need to grind. \n\n Lastly, my major annoyance with the game is the alarm timer aspect wherby after a certain number of turns the alertness of a ship goes up. This means that new enemies will spawn and turrets will turn on. For a few levels this is fine, where the alert will begin at a major fight or when you're going to extraction but when I heard the alarm blaring at the start of a map I found myself sighing in knowing what is to come. By the time I'd reached the end of the map I'd inevitably be at a fairly advanced alert level even if I had rushed since some enemies just aren't one hit kills. Sometimes it felt like playing whack-a-mole as a new enemy would pop out near me each turn as I was ready to go to the next room. So kill that one, get ready again and...oh wait, another enemy. It was frustrating, especially as the game demonstrated time after time it could introduce new ways to add difficulty or variation.\n\n Putting my rant aside, I did enjoy this game and I feel others will be satisfied at what the game has to offer.

It is definitely a unique style of game that i would recommend to anyone looking for a turn-based, strategy crossed with delicate aiming mechanics that require precision and accuracy to master. \nPros\n.Unique genere of game that involves easy to learn, hard to master aiming mechanics and fundamental strategy implications\n.There is a story to this game with multiple cut-scenes that will have you hooked until the end\n.Different levels and experiences each time you play through (different drops, you can focus on leveling up different characters etc.)\n.The diversity of accessories, hats (for your characters to look cool =P) and weapons that you are able to equip to different characters\n.Different passive and active abilities that each character has (once you level them up)\n.The different strategies you have to employ once you make it to the next stage\n.Graphics are pretty good and will run on most computers\n.The outcome of each battle is different every time\nCons\n.it's too short", "timestamp_created": 1499306213, "timestamp_updated": 1499306213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33295006": {"recommendationid": "33295006", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960269409", "num_games_owned": 386, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499297934}, "language": "english", "review": "Tremendously good game that I knew nothing about going in.

So often these indy games that try to merge genres are interesting for the first few hours but they very quickly plateau and become repetitive. Not so with SteamWorld Heist! The genres of turn-based strategy, RPG and 2d platformer are seemlessly interwoven in such a fashion that you can't help but feel that the gameplay belongs entirely to itself, and isn't at all the child of other better games (as is so often the case).\n\nThe gameplay is simple - you travel from space hulk to space hulk with your band of steampunk robots deploying the team that you think is best suited for the task at hand. At first, your pool of bots to choose from is small but they quickly grow into a roster of characters with very different playstyles. As is standard with many turn-based games, you get 2 actions per turn per character. You can either stay still and have an action, move a short distance and have an action or move double distance and not get an action. Shooting demands you get good at eyeballing your aim in a manner that is similar to Worms, however there is a gentle yet slightly erratic bob which means even the most well-aimed shot can go awry. Conversely, pulling off a crazy shot that bounces off a number of walls before hitting a baddie in cover in the back of his head is air-punchingly pleasing.\n\nAs your team levels and their distinct skillsets grow, you begin to see how they synergise both with the lovely loot you pick up (of which there is plenty) and with each other. Also of note is how most of the maps are randomly created and all of them are individually skill-level customisable, meaning there is great replay value.\n\nAnd it's awfully pretty to boot! This isn't a game that masks it's indy status with faux 8-bit graphics, it's actually very nice to look at with each SteamBot on your team looking characterful with their chosen loadouts clearly displayed. Of final note is how pleasing the on-ship banter is between the bots - each character feels distinct and I found I warmed to each and every one of them.\n\nI'm giving this a solid 9/10. I was expecting a fun diversion, something cheeky and casual, and it easilly succeeds in being both of those things - however, on the harder settings it becomes a well-honed finely-balanced strategic challenge and a very welcome addition to the turn-based genre.", "timestamp_created": 1499243104, "timestamp_updated": 1499243508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33264239": {"recommendationid": "33264239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291479696", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499238259}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u90fd\u6709\u5171\u540c\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff1a\u6740\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e0a\u763e", "timestamp_created": 1499239836, "timestamp_updated": 1499239836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617587", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33263963": {"recommendationid": "33263963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243510804", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1415, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513727100}, "language": "russian", "review": "SteamWorld Heist - \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440! \u0417\u0430\u0442\u044f\u0433\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e. \u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430, \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c. \u0421\u0430\u043c \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0418\u043d\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044c \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0435, \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0430. \u0425\u043e\u0447\u0443 \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u044e \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c. \u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e.", "timestamp_created": 1499239072, "timestamp_updated": 1511508687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33256253": {"recommendationid": "33256253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044466393", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 1515976811}, "language": "english", "review": "Dehyrated robot pirates embark upon intergalactic water heists which devolve into hat-sniping missions.

This allows for headshots to induce critical attacks, use the environment, and to ricochet bullets. You are also suppose to recruit new team members with different abilities, and develop them to unlock their powers. In order to complete the game, it is almost essential to have four characters fully leveled up, and at least someone with a top tier weapon. \n\nTactics\n\nSuccess will be determined by how you strategically place your Steambots to allow for maximum defense and attack position. Levels are randomly generated, but rarely did I encounter a level that felt unfair. There are a variety of ways to find cover, whether it's a destructible barrel, sturdy plasma shield, or an indestructible steel support. Similar to XCOM, you can choose to move to a point where you can attack post movement, or sprint to a location where you won't be able to attack that turn. The environment also provides explosive objects that can be used for or against you. At times, you may be required to ricochet a bullet to an explosive barrel in order to avoid disaster, combining to mechanics into one action. These moments really make you feel like a badass, but at the same time the game expects you to be intelligent enough to recognize when you're suppose to do theses things.\n\n \n\n\nOn the standard difficulty, the enemy AI is rather forgiving. They are rarely in the open, but at the same time they are not the most accurate when firing back at you. The most devastating enemies are ones with forward facing indestructible shields that rush and melee you. About half of the levels have alarms, which require you to beat a level in a certain amount of turns. While alarms are active, more enemies appear and have to be disposed of. When the enemy outnumbers you significantly is when you'll run into trouble. At that point it doesn't really matter how smart they are when they outgun you. \n\nStory\n\nThe story starts off with self interests in mind, but then leads to you wanting to save the world, like any great story. Technically, you and your crew are pirates. There are other pirates in the system that are causing trouble, and you don't want the Royal Fleet coming in and disturbing your pillages, so you try to end it so things calm down. From there it progresses and you'll end up facing three different enemy races each with distinct abilities and personalities. The art style in combination with the script brings this game to life and they work well together. As simple as the story is, it is fulfilling and feels original. \n\n \n\n \n\n\nClasses\n\nThe following classes are available during gameplay:\n\nSniper - Weapons have laser sight which allows for great accuracy, and for seeing the trajectory of a bullet when it ricochets, allowing for complex shots to be taken. However, snipers can't shoot if they move during a turn (unless the weapon they are wielding allows for that). \n\nAssault - Weapons consist of sub machine guns and shotguns. Assault class can be used in close up or mid range situations. Depending on the weapon wielded, it will usually be inaccurate and high in damage, or moderatly accurate with moderate damage. Assault classes usually have average health as well. \n\nVanguard - This is the close range class that can wield shotguns or submachine guns. Usually posesss abilities that regenerate health or have high defense to support their close range role. Equipping with a shotgun is recommended. \n\nHeavy - Contain explosive type weapons or mini guns. This class isn't unlocked until the middle of the game, but I found it to be very essential. Like a sniper, sometimes can't fire a weapon after they've moved. The heavy will deal the most damage of any class, but may have low health and defense. I would not have beaten the game without this class.\n\n \n\nArt\n\nThe 2D art is very good and original. There aren't too many animations, but the ones that are executed are done very well without any noticeable flaws. I particularly liked when enemies were killed they would explode into a bunch of parts that would fall on the floor, because they are steambots. It was usually done in slow motion as well, so you would be rewarded visually each time you killed an enemy. The bullet impact would also be in slow motion, allowing for you to register the location of your bullet and if you got a critical hit which contributed to the kill. The backgrounds of the galaxies, interior of the ships, and weapons all have details about them that show a real effort was made to make each item in the game be apart of the world. \n\n \n\n\nSummary\n\nI had more fun playing this than I did XCOM: Enemy Unknown. The control I had hitting enemies, while also using strategy makes it superior in my opinion, despite the game not being in 3D. I spent about 15 hours playing this, but each moment I was progressing and being pushed to purchase new weapons and armor. The story was advancing in each moment as well, at no point did I feel like I was wasting my time. The final boss is extremely hard, but I was able to win in two tries, with a mix of luck and skill. This game is a must play, and you'll likely be able to get it on sale. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1499142202, "timestamp_updated": 1499142202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

However, remembering that Cool Ghosts and Extra Credits both recommended it, and seeing as it was on sale for a mere 5 bucks during the summer, I decided to give it a try anyway.\n\n13 hours later, I can comfortably say that this game is well worth checking out. That childish humor only shows up in a few places, standing in odd contrast to writing which is otherwise surprisingly solid. The game doesn't take itself too seriously, but still sets up a solid story that's easy to follow. Many of the crew members are quite likeable (I'll exclude Sally), and the cast you meet along the way are archetypical but not dull.\n\nMechanically, this game is brilliant. The shooting feels consistent, and the different types of guns really set themselves apart. Leveling up feels good, getting new equipment feels good, but neither out does the other. Movement can be a touch slow and floaty, but being able to tab between characters during movement is a nice touch.\n\nMusic and graphics were, for me, nothing to write home about, but the sound design is generally solid and I almost never found any inconsistencies between what I saw on the screen and what was actually happening.

If a bot is \"killed\" (perhaps \"junked\" would be more accurate) in a mission, then they gain no experience.  If you lose or abort a mission, you lose half of your total water.  This leads to annoying situations where a bot gets killed, but you must press on with the mission to avoid the water hit... then still have to replay the mission to get experience for the bot that died, plus a full star rating for the level.  Want to save time and just abort so you can replay immediately?  Well then, say goodbye to half your water for wanting to save yourself some grind!  All of which could've been avoided with the simple option to restart a mission at any time (losing any loot and experience picked up on that level only), or with a turn rewind option to even out the random ricochets that cause unintended bot losses.\n\nFar too frustrating to play because of this loss mechanic, but otherwise a good game.

This is not my main problem. Real buzz killer is that these enemies are infinite in numbers. On top of that, after a number of turns their spawns become doubled and any level with countdown just becomes impossible to finish without casualties. Unfortunately, in every two levels, there is a countdown. \n\nSo, if you linger, you lose. Sometimes money, sometimes completion stars, sometimes the level. Exact opposite of my game taste. I could be fine with the game, if the number of enemies were somehow standardized. In this case, I think it is a cheap attempt at making the game more challenging.

They have fantastic skill managing the player's ability to progress, and the art and sound design is perfect and distinct.\n\nThe stories give no pressure, and easy goals to understand. You're here and there is only one way to go. You don't progress because of the story tells you to; you progress because it feels good to do so.

[spoiler]Or maybe not, since they are too different[/spoiler] \nEven if you won't, you will definitely love this game, since it does with the utmost elegance something so stupid it is actually brilliant: merging shooter mechanics with turn-based, with an RPG twist. \nI know, it just sounds like I'm throwing around random bull**** in order to show the poor reader how cool a gamer I am, \nbut while such option feels very [spoiler]not[/spoiler] appealing, I actually mean what I'm saying.\n\nIn SteamWorld Heist you play as a team of way-too-edgy rogue robots - CowBots, I mean - who fight for control of their own territory and end up finding themselves involved in a dark case of NecRobotmancy, as I like to call it. I will say nothing more about the story [spoiler]because I have to finish it yet, but it doesn't matter because my review is still great,\n right? ...Right?[/spoiler], but it definitely does its job while being nothing over the top, thanks to its all-encompassing irony in particular.\n\nWhat really shines in this game is the gameplay: [spoiler]quite obvious, since a game not shining for its gameplay is probably a book or a film[/spoiler] every mission requires you to delve with 2-3 of your CowBots in procedurally generated - which isn't as in \"completely random\" but more as in \"the general layout is fixed, what is inside changes a bit every time\" - enemy spaceships filled with enemies and boons and achieve one or more objectives; each member of the quite diverse cast at your disposal will be able to bring on missions two utility items and a very welcome firearm to defend themselves/cull their enemies, depending on how you like to see it [spoiler]the result is the same, dead RoBodies everywhere[/spoiler]. Each game turn, each character in sight will be able to make its move, starting with your CowBots. You will be able to move them a short distance and shoot, or you will be able to sprint a longer distance and rest afterwards, or you will be able to stand still, or everything in between. \nThe shooting part is not just a click-the-shoot-button-and-watch-your-character-miss-randomly-and-die-horribly, it actually requires you, the player, to aim with your mouse and shoot in the direction you decide to, which is what makes this game actually genius. The player is not just a god-like figure (not so god-like since you actually exist but whatever) looking at the characters and directing their actions from above, he also gets to take the role of every single character and fine-tune his actions! What's not to like about that? Plus, this allows you to exploit walls and covers to have your bullets ricochet on that damn monster bearing a shield bigger than himself [spoiler]good luck with getting good ricochets without a sniper weapon though[/spoiler].\n\nConcerning the \"artistic\" aspects of the game, this is all about personal tastes, but I really appreciate the cartoonish, colourful graphics a lot. The background music is great too, even though there're way too many tracks with vocals, in my humbly humble opinion. This being said, the few instrumental tracks are nothing less than great and actually manage to build up a quite immersive ambience.\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]\nThis game has the originality, has the atmosphere, has the gameplay and - most important - has the fun. I wouldn't give it a 10/10 [spoiler]just because I'm a freakin' bast***[/spoiler], but it definitely deserves a noice 9. Try it whenever you can, it would be worth it even at full price.

You recruit more team members (robots; by the way, you lead a team of robots), you participate in fights and collect \"swag\".  Only the surviving bots receive experience. And you MUST have hats for your robots. All the goodies/swag that you collect - besides the much needed weapons and upgrades - SHALL be used to buy hats. Or even better, shoot them from the heads of your enemies. That shot will not damage the enemy, but you will get one hat and that is all that matters in the end, after winning the fight so the hat will be yours, of course. Don't forget to pick it up, don't leave it in the dust.\nAnother important hint, you definitely need all the storage space that you can buy. This comes before the bare necessity of having an imposing hat collection.\nSo: 1) better guns (100% you will obtain those from fights) 2) storage space 3) HATS. Many-many hats in many forms.\nGrinding: it depends. You need more swag? Replay the fights and don't loose the fights. You need better firepower, better guns? If you are not in the third episode, it does not matter too much unless you are playing on elite difficulty. But let's say that you need more firepower now. Well, some grinding and a little bit of luck is required.\n\nHopefully you will find your hat, you will be well hatted, and enjoy the experience, BLUB!\n\nI played on veteran difficulty, I restarted a few times but in the end I got the rhythm and I finished/won the game. On elite difficulty it looks like grinding is a necessity (the better firepower is an absolute necessity from the start) and some dialogues seemed a bit changed.\n\nOverall I am very satisfied with the experience. A nice little game that is professionally well done and your point and shoot skills matter. And God forbid, do not ever go into a fight without a hat! Your best achievement evah is to shoot 3 hats off from your enemies, with only one bullet.

This allows me to play without having the pressure to rush to fight the boss\n+ Unlike XCOM, you can control the aim of the gun.

The tedium of watching enemies and characters move around and climb ladders without a fast forward button wore me out after a while. This also made battles draw on forever, especially if it was an area you were re-attempting for grinding. \n \nEarly on in the game I made the mistake of starting on a higher difficulty. Tougher levels on this difficulty felt near impossible without only putting my best foot forward, leaving me to abandon lower leveled teammates who never got any xp for dying near the end. I surprisingly found myself grinding for a few levels between boss fights, a frustrating task given that battles move slow and that dead teammates and failed missions give you no xp.\n \nStrategy in the game seems straightforward, and this becomes even more apparent on easier difficulties. It mostly feels like there\u2019s only one viable response for most scenarios. Put in the same circumstance in a level, I would probably expect myself to always react the same way. However, on harder difficulties, if you have to improvise, you\u2019ll probably lose a teammate. Once you get an \u2018A -team\u2019 together, there\u2019s no point in attempting to train other teammates and without their later abilities, a lot of teammates feel identical.\n \nAfter a few disheartening failures on the first boss, and being in no mood to replay old levels, I turned the difficulty down and then, before the 2nd boss, had to turn the difficulty down once more. From this point, I was just interested in getting the game off my list and, with the help of a completionist drive, blazed to the end of the game on casual mode.\n \nThe final area is not only the coolest one but contains the best weapons and, by this point, your A-team should have a whole onslaught of tools and abilities unlocked that makes gameplay feel more varied from battle to battle.\n \n \nOn the brighter side of things, I suppose I ended up enjoying Steamworld Heist by the end of the game. The general view of this game seems to be pretty positive and it does have a decent soundtrack plus the artstyle/world is charming. \n \nPerhaps if I had played it on casual mode from the beginning I would\u2019ve been able to recommend it, but simply based off of my experience, I wouldn\u2019t suggest it to a friend. \n \n \n \n \nOutline:\nFeels like a waste of time\nSlow AF movement\nDeaths have no XP - failing late into a boss battle means you\u2019ve wasted 10 minutes and have to go back and grid\nIf you play on higher difficulties - not really about skill, more about weapons and trying \nStruggled with anything beyond regular mode\nI did end up playing to the end:\nSwitched off Experienced (assume this meant I\u2019ve played games before) and a breezed through the last world\nDialog is pointless, skipped all of it", "timestamp_created": 1498073501, "timestamp_updated": 1498073580, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32612762": {"recommendationid": "32612762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044448313", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 951, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498089019}, "language": "english", "review": "Yea this game is fantastic...\n\nSteamworld Heist is a turn-based, tactical action game with heavy influence from games like XCOM. I'd even go as far as to say that this game plays like XCOM if it played on a 2D plane. It is extremely well made and the mechanics all completment themselves nicely.\n\nSo the game's main quirk is manually aiming your unit's weapons. This wouldn't be such a huge thing if your bullets didn't richochet like fucking rubber bullets. Due to this you can pull of some crazy ass trick shots, those of which saved may ass many times. Your first time through you'll probably find yourself in quite a few sticky situations on the battlefield, so being able to pull of these trickshots will be crucial to your crew survivng the scuffle. \n\nAll in all it's a very rewarding game; you're almost always sorting through new loot and gaining more water, which acts as the game's currency and the combat can be very satisfying if you set up your shots correctly. \n\nI would reccommend this game at full price WITH the \"The Outsider\" DLC, as it adds a few extra missions, a party member, and new items.

Una combinaci\u00f3n que en principio suena extra\u00f1a, pero que a mi gusto es justo lo que el g\u00e9nero necesita. \n\nLos SRPG, como cualquier juego de estrategia, se basa en la anticipaci\u00f3n y la posici\u00f3n. Tus unidades tienen habilidades y debilidades muy claras y el uso \u00f3ptimo no es el mismo para todos (Intenta usar un francotirador para melee si hay dudas). Eso s\u00ed, una vez dominado el sistema puede volverse un juego de estad\u00edsticas, o en el peor de los casos, un ajedrez digital. Por supuesto, este g\u00e9nero tiene su p\u00fablico y entiendo perfectamente porqu\u00e9, pero el componente de habilidad una vez pasada la curva de aprendizaje es practicamente inexistente. \n\nAqu\u00ed es d\u00f3nde entra Steamworld Heist. S\u00ed, los personajes tienen roles muy definidos. S\u00ed, el juego se basa en estad\u00edsticas, habilidades e \u00edtems que potencian ambas. Pero la punter\u00eda est\u00e1 en tus manos, y la \u00fanica diferencia entre que tu pistola de nivel 9 consiga un headshot con una trayectoria cuasi-imposible o dispare inofensivamente a 2 metros del enemigo est\u00e1 solo en tu habilidad. Este es el rasgo central del juego, y el resto del mismo esta construido para complementarlo perfectamente.\n\nEl apartado est\u00e9tico es genial. Los gr\u00e1ficos y la m\u00fasica est\u00e1n consagrados a crear ese ambiente Western-Steampunk que lo impregna todo y no se toma a s\u00ed mismo en serio. Y la verdad es que, sin lucirse demasiado, hacen muy bien ese trabajo. Es innegable que el juego tiene personalidad.\n\nUna dificultad modulable (Con recompensas y penalizaciones), la posiblidad de completar al 100% misiones antiguas  y un NG+ con todos los personajes desde el principio otorgan mucha rejugabilidad a un videojuego cuya mec\u00e1nica ya es divertida de por s\u00ed. Tambi\u00e9n hay un DLC con m\u00e1s misiones  rondando por ah\u00ed, por si quedan ganas.\n\nLas convenciones de los SRPG siempre han sido muy r\u00edgidas; es un g\u00e9nero que se origin\u00f3 en Jap\u00f3n siempre ha estado dominado por un pu\u00f1ado de franquicias que no se atreven a  innovar por miedo al fracaso. Es por esto que ver a un equipo indie europeo dar este giro de tuerca al g\u00e9nero, y lo que es mejor, hacerlo tan bien, trae gozo y esperanza a mi corazoncito.\n\nMu g\u00fceno.

Finer pallettes will not be satisfied with this one.\n\nFirst off, it's not bad. It's probably great for a younger or newer gamer, and that's kinda their target audience, so I have to admit I might be being harsh in my review.  But this is from a 30 yr. old avid gamer, so take my opinion with salt.\n\nIt's a solid game for a little while and does many things well. But since I played it for what, three days was it? and now I never care to anymore, I'm not reccommending it.\n\nStory is pretty simplistic, but I've seen worse.  Think NES era story quality. Dialogue is is mediocre, and leaves you wanting more from characters.  A good contrast would be FF7 where I wanted to talk to every character I could just to see what would happen from doing so.  Nothing happens from talking except little tid-bits of lore, which isn't really worth the \"effort\" of waiting for that text to populate the screen. TLDR: talking to people is boring in this game.\n\nNo real penalties from losing other than cash, so there's never much tension to win.  Aside from that it's one of the easiest games I've played (playing on default difficulty).\n\nTactics are weird, and probably what throws me the most about this game.  It's not very tactical.  If you build out your loadout well there's almost nothing you can't handle.  Bouncing bullets mean that almost nobody is safe from a sharpshooter's ricochet, leaving cover as a nice to have rather than need.  You can shoot enemies behind cover 80% of the time, so they basically just sabotage themselves by thinking themselves safe.  They'll shoot at you fruitlessly from behind cover all day, leaving you to either run up and blow off their heads, return fire from your safe vantage, or simply avoid them.\n\nThere's not a level of challanging reward I'd go for.\n\nCharacters are actually designed quite well, aside from their dialogue.  visuals and classes have unique and pertinent bonuses that really contribute to the experience.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1497402313, "timestamp_updated": 1497402314, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467555", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32400917": {"recommendationid": "32400917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155533962", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501114454}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "recomendo.Jogo dinamico e estrategico", "timestamp_created": 1497401046, "timestamp_updated": 1497401046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32400570": {"recommendationid": "32400570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108746169", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499660899}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best turn-based strategy games I have ever played.\n\nScore: 9.5/10\n\nPros:\n-Skill is always put to the test.\n-Each character you play feels different and unique (even if they are part of the same class). \n-Boss fights are extremely challenging and rewarding.\n-Planning ahead can make an extreme difference.\n-The order in which you take your turn matters.\n\nCons:\n-Story is quite predictable.\n-All missions are loot or destroy and get out.", "timestamp_created": 1497399219, "timestamp_updated": 1497399219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32399859": {"recommendationid": "32399859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259537668", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506273060}, "language": "polish", "review": "fajna, zbawna, nieskomplikowana gierka", "timestamp_created": 1497395444, "timestamp_updated": 1497395444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32396824": {"recommendationid": "32396824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321724991", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497383412}, "language": "italian", "review": "Gioco incredibile mi ha tenuto incollato per 14 ore , offre un livello di sfida incredibile ed il gameplay anche se a turni \u00e8 accessibile a tutti poich\u00e8 \u00e8 molto dinamico come gioco", "timestamp_created": 1497384132, "timestamp_updated": 1497384132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32395517": {"recommendationid": "32395517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002718494", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497376503}, "language": "polish", "review": "Nie wiem co o tym my\u015ble\u0107, gra\u0142o si\u0119 zajebi\u015bcie, ca\u0142o\u015b\u0107 sko\u0144czy\u0142em w 13h (bez misji pobocznych) roz\u0142o\u017cone na kilka dni, wi\u0119c wci\u0105gn\u0119\u0142o mnie bardzo.

He's got a gun! Shoot him\"\n\"But I like his hat\"\n\"Shoot him in the face!\"\n\"But I want his hat...\"\n\nAn utterly stellar title! Whilst the concept of steampunk robot cowboy space pirates might sound... bizarre. It's a brilliantly imagined and executed concept - boasting cracking graphics, charming humour, great music and, most importantly, really cool gameplay.\n\nThe crux is that it's like a 2D XCOM in terms of cover and movement, with the aiming and shooting of Worms. The shooting, in particular, is what makes this game. Instead of dice rolls... it's down to your skill with the not-so-steady hands of your crew. The ability to ricochet bullets makes this particularly fun, leading to some beautiful punch-the-sky trick-shots and eye-wateringly bad misses (my worst being a grenade that bounced over the foe... and back to my feet). A very refreshing and inspired addition indeed. The difficulty is well paced and picks up nicely as you go along, with some really challenging enemies and timed missions popping up. The levels are also enjoyably varied and the randomly generated maps are a really nice touch to keep things fresh.\n\nThe characters are also great. Really likeable and brilliantly designed with their unique ranges of abilities and weapons. They each bring a very distinct playstyle to the table, further enriching the game's variety.\n\nThe game is also full of hats. You can shoot them off your foes and collect them. They do nothing. They're pointless... yet are somehow strangely addictive. It makes for a silly sub-game, especially where rare ones pop up from time to time. I don't care if that Scrapper has an auto gun and a bad attitude - he has a pink baseball cap and I want it!\n\nMy one and only gripe is that the weapon balance feels a bit poor. Most sniper and assault weapons (shotguns / semi-autos) feel far too situational to be reliable, especially where they are barely stronger than most pistols / explosives but come with harsh penalties (cannot move and shoot, short range, scatters...)\n\nBut that's it. Everything else ticked all the boxes for me as a champion indie title. Absolutely fantastic and I cannot recommend it enough. And, just as the intro says... Best enjoyed with a controller and your favourite hat.

At first glance, it might seem like a nice little platformer, but it has a lot more depth than meets the eye. I played through on Regular difficulty, and managed to get 100% completion in 15 or so hours.\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Graphics are pleasant. Not high-end, but a lot of fun.\n+ Music is excellent. And the game features the group Steam Powered Giraffe, a steampunk band that has written some excellent songs. (Confession: I kind of freaked out when I heard one of their songs playing at a location in the game.)\n+ Gameplay is very well done. There is a dexterity element, but not too much.\n+ Hats. Hats are awesome. I can't get enough hats. \n\nCONS:\n- My one complaint would be that it got easier as I went on. My characters slowly grew in power compared to the enemy bots, so that the only reason I had to replay the final boss level was because I was so careless in how I played. That being said, it was still difficult enough to make me slow down and think my way through to beat the level.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nI love this game. Buy it, especially on sale.

La prima cosa che mi \u00e8 piaciuta \u00e8 il design del gioco in s\u00e9, tutte le macchine, cio\u00e8 i robot che andremo ad utilizzare sono tutti molto diversi tra loro, sia nell'aspetto sia nel carattere. Si, perch\u00e9 a differenza di molti titoli indie in cui troveremo dei personaggi anonimi, qui c'\u00e8 anche un po' di lore ben strutturata in maniera semplice e i personaggi che potremo scegliere (che senza i DLC sono 9), sono tutti ben caratterizzati e con il loro background narrativo interessante, raccontato in maniera semplice ma gradevole. \nLa storia \u00e8 molto semplice, mai banale. All'inizio, questa storia semplice servir\u00e0 a farci appassionare al gioco, sucessivamente potr\u00e0 sembrare troppo scontata, quindi non adatta a chi cerca una storia profonda. \nIl gioco risulta essere originale anche perch\u00e9 \u00e8 uno strategico a turni, pertanto diverso dai tradizionali RTS, ma \u00e8 originale paragonato anche agli altri strategici a turni, perch\u00e9 sarete voi con la vostra abilit\u00e0 di mira a decidere le sorti di una battaglia, dal momento che gestirete voi la direzionalit\u00e0 dei colpi e avendo la possibilit\u00e0 di far rimbalzare i colpi sulle pareti questa ottima meccanica di gioco viene esaltata ancora di pi\u00f9. All'interno del gioco troviamo pure una componente RPG che io ho apprezzato poich\u00e9 incide leggermente sui combattimenti lasciando alla componente strategica e di precisione nella mira (quindi, all'abilit\u00e0 del giocatore) come componenti predominanti per vincere una battaglia. Il multiplayer \u00e8 assente. Le mappe sono procedurali, ed ho apprezzato anche questo perch\u00e9 cos\u00ec facendo non imparerai mai un livello a memoria, ed anche se ripetendo ciascuna missione sar\u00e0 pi\u00f9 facile affrontare la missione, la componente strategica sar\u00e0 importante per concluderlo con successo. Man mano che si andr\u00e0 avanti col gioco tutti i personaggi sbloccheranno abilit\u00e0 diverse tipo pi\u00f9 movimento, recupero salute, invulnerabilit\u00e0, modalit\u00e0 Berserk, fare due mosse in un turno, pi\u00f9 attacco ed ognuno oltre alla pistola che \u00e8 l'arma pi\u00f9 comune in questo gioco potr\u00e0 utilizzare solo un altro tipo di arma come i fucili d'assalto, che sparano raffiche di proiettili, ma non sono precisi, fucili da cecchino dotati di mirino laser a lunga gittata e quindi con ottima precisione, alcuni tipi di armi da cecchino hanno un'alta probabilit\u00e0 di critico se i nemici vengono colpiti alla testa ed una capacit\u00e0 di infliggere danni leggermante superiore ai normali fucili da cecchino, ma se in un turno decidi di muoverti non puoi sparare e vice versa, le armi pesanti hanno un danno d'impatto piccolo, medio, grande, comunque pi\u00f9 grande degli altri tipi di armi e possono arrecare danni anche agli alleati, molte di esse hanno una traiettoria ad arco, quindi poco precise, mentre solo una minima parte delle altre categorie di armi hanno traiettoria ad arco e fanno danni ad area.\nInfine si potranno portare con s\u00e9 due oggetti a personaggio che possono curare, infliggere pi\u00f9 danni da esplosione come (missili e granate), o pi\u00f9 danni da mischia quando si \u00e8 vicini all'avversario o avere pi\u00f9 movimento per avanzare di pi\u00f9 caselle o invulnerabilit\u00e0 per un turno per incrementare la componente strategica del titolo.\nQuindi un ottimo lavoro da parte di Image & Form Games con questo titolo che \u00e8 interessantissimo sia per gli amanti degli strategici, sia per i neofiti, sia per chi vuole provare nuovi generi di giochi. Io l'ho acquistato su Hunble Bundle a $ 1 assieme ad altri due titoli, perci\u00f2 a \u20ac 0,30 ciascuno.

Now i realize that description does not do this game justice. Granted there are a few similarities, being that it is a turn based strategy game where you move troops and kill enemies, but that is about where it stops. I've come to realize that everything else that is in the game is why i keep coming back to it. It has a little bit of everything for everyone. If you are into steampunky robots then the aesthetic is right up your alley. If you like a kinda rag tag group of space pirates trying to change the world then the story should have you engaged and laughing the whole way through. If you like compelling turn based gameplay with a decent variety of weapons and inventive gunplay, then this is the game for you. There are, however, some things i don\u2019t particularly like. For example, near the beginning of the game it feels like you're always leveling, changing out your guns, and experiencing new encounters. After the halfway point though this slowed down pretty hard for me. This is probably because i found who i like and kitted everyone how i wanted to by then so the experimentation phase was over and the refining phase had begun. I just kinda wished they had paced out the leveling and loot grabbing a little slower in the beginning and sped it up a little near the end. It doesn\u2019t really hurt the game it is just a small nitpick for an overall great indie title. Oh and one more thing, the music in this game is done by a band called Steam Powered Giraffe, and it is all phenomenal.

It's what could be described as a combination between Scorched Earth and Fire Emblem... a turn-based strategy game that takes place on a 2d plane where the ability to aim arcing shots is part of the strategy. As far as I know, Steamworld Heist is the first game to try anything like this, and it succeeds quite admirably.\n\nAs unusual as the game is, it's very intuitive, thanks in part to its multiple difficulty modes, as well as the general structure of the game. The first mission begins with two playable characters, one of which has a scope to help her aim, and a fairly straightforward quest to pick up a certain treasure chest. As more missions are completed, more characters are unlocked, and and new concepts such as time limits and survival rounds come up, all in an organic way that never leaves the player feeling overwhelmed.\n\nThe art style carries over from I&F's earlier game Steamworld Dig, with larger sprites, each character having their own cool, distinctive robotic design. As for the soundtrack, well, it's beyond reproach. Missions are accompanied by adrenaline-pumping beats, while the occasional visit to a saloon (or victory over a boss) will treat you to a delightful vocal tune from Steam-powered Giraffe. I don't buy soundtracks to go with my steam games often, but I did with this one!\n\nAs an added li'l bonus, this is one of the few games that adjusts its graphics accordingly if you play it with a Playstation controller in the MacOS version.\n\nThis game does just about everything right; if I were to find something to nitpick, it's with the hat collection, which is both the best and worst feature, as while most of them can be simply bought or shot off of specific enemies, there are certain ones (a few of which the achievements require) that require luck and grinding... and grinding just doesn't suit this game all that well.\n\nBuy this game!

While at the same time staying its own game and taking only the steam punk esthetic from its predecessor, [b]SteamWorld Dig[/b].\n\nSo the game plays as follows: fly your ship between checkpoints in space - a map or hub area if you will. These may be space station bars where you get your drink on (what do robots drink anyway?), buy weapons and other equipment or hire other scrappy robots which can be used as units in battle. Other areas, enemy ships, is where you will be spending most of your time, battling it out and collecting loot to use or money to spend. Sometimes you may come across a lonesome space station selling hats at outrageously high prices...\n\nSo the bulk of the game is spent in battles and the combat system is well polished to make that time fly by. You enter a semi randomly generated map (station) with usually two or three teammates equipped with weapons and accessories of your choosing. Each round gives you a movement and attack phase in which you can either hide for cover or attack (sometimes both). Since step count is limited, it is important to find a location in which you will be hard to hit yet still easy to hit your enemy from. It is a simple design that may lack some depth. I would love to have the ability to have one of my teammates just defend a position and shoot whomever wanders into its line of sight but right now all a defending teammate does is cower behind a barrel and get hit if an enemy chooses show who has the biggest metal sack. Attacking is more engaging and rightfully more fun. An assortment of weapons is available all wealdable by its specific class of character. Your everyday pistols, scoped weapons offer bouncing bullets, high spread shotguns, high rate-of-fire multiple shot rifles, AOE line of sight RPG explosions, arching grenade launcher AOE explosion and metal to brass fists all offer different playstiles and entry points to each situation one may find oneself in. I particularly enjoyed scoped weapons which offere laser sights for their easy of use in bouncing bullets off walls to hit harder to hit enemies. Since headshots provide a higher damage output, these were particularly useful. A good combination of different characters with different weapon sets does the job fine while mixing it up just a little bit as to not get too monotonous while shooting only one tipe of weapon (as if it ever could). The reward for clearing out these outposts is usually more gear to use for the next mission or money to buy yet more gear OR a fancy hat or two. Hats are the money sink that makes the economy work as you will soon have enough money to have all equipment you need. It's an alright system that seems to work fine with most virtual macro economies, here being no different.\n\nEach map sector ends with a boss fight in which all your skills will be tested against a fairly stronger enemy. The difficulty of these are nicely tuned and provide ample release of dopamine.\n\nEsthetically SteamWorld Heist reminds me of Firefly (Tv Series, 2002) albeit with a cartoony overlay. Space ships looking like the scifi future movies promise swapped for coal powered furnaces and steam turbines. Ships held together by sheet metal and rivets. A world populated by robots wielding guns, wearing fancy hats and everything generally feeling like the wild west in space. The music consolidates this idea of steam punk wild west robots in space. Guitar, banjo, bass, fiddle and a strong vocal presence that tells stories of robots are exactly what one would expect from a world such as this. The Band [b][url=https://steampoweredgiraffe.bandcamp.com/album/music-from-steamworld-heist]Steam Powered Giraffe[/url][/b] are personified as robots and can be found in any bar in the game playing their music. I sometimes visited just for the music. \n\nSteamWorld Heist is a great game to relax with and not stress over too much. Core gameplay containing simple tactical turn based gameplay. It clearly defines goals and provides extra rewards for extra work / exploration. A pleasant to look at esthetic and guitar heavy soundtrack with some rather fine folksy vocals.

"review": "What an excellent game. Thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.\n\nSteamWorld Heist is a great application of Worms-esqe skillful turn-based combat. Sure, no wind speed or power meters or crazy weapons, but having to physically aim the weapons instead of praying to RNGesus is a sadly underutilized turn-based combat mechanic.\n\nWeapon/loot variety is pretty anemic, but on the other hand I appreciated that it minimized time spent gearing up the crew. There was a great progression in environments and enemy types, so I was constantly tweaking my tactics instead of falling into a rut. I really enjoyed the diverse crew members you can recruit. Some characters appeared useless at first, but really blossomed after levelling up. In fact, it was the snipers (of which you can end up with three) which initially felt overpowered, and ended up the most useless by the end.\n\nPerfect length; didn't overstay its welcome, felt fresh from beginning to end.

So far it only has 4 games (2 were released on Steam, this one included), but they're just marvelous. By the way, check out [b]SteamWorld Dig[/b], if you haven't yet -- support the real deal in indie game development!\n\nAnyway, back to the game.\n\nSimply put, it's a turn-based tactical strategy with heavy focus on aiming in combat. You can customize your squad with a variety of weapons and items. You can also change your squad members with new members you find throughout the game. Team composition matters a lot -- your teammates have different classes, so each of them is sporting different skillset, can use different weapons and can be very effective in some scenarios while lacking in others. Classes are somewhat close to what newest XCom was offering.\n\nAim plays heavy role in combat, as it is not % based (like it was in Fallout or XCom), but instead you get to pick a moment and shoot the waddling crosshair yourself, and Missing is very easy, especially on long distances, but hitting that bouncing off the walls shot is very fulfilling, even if the enemy is still alive after that.\n\nLearning curve is pretty good -- difficulty is going up gradually, so you'll have time to learn every nook and cranny. Also, every level that you played already can be replayed to grind some more XP for your crew members (if the upcoming level seems too hard for you).\n\nStory is great, dialogue is heavily affected by a variety of spaghetti westerns. Characters are well-written and occasional phrases by crew members are hilarious.\n\nGraphics and animation are awesome -- if you like cartoonish look and fluent animation, you'll definitely love this.\n\nSounds and music are fitting and are not distracting at all. OST is sold separately, so if you're into that, buy one for yourself (or listen on Youtube for free, whatever floats your boat).\n\n[h1]Will I recommend this game?[/h1]\nDefinitely. People that love a good western and turn-based combat are going to love it. Fans of indie games are going to love it as well.", "timestamp_created": 1495888965, "timestamp_updated": 1495888965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31988248": {"recommendationid": "31988248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110784988", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496455326}, "language": "schinese", "review": "2D\u7248XCOM\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6ca1\u6709\u6076\u5fc3\u7684\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u673a\u5236\u8fd8\u662f\u633a\u597d\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1495859419, "timestamp_updated": 1495859419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31987138": {"recommendationid": "31987138", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999337717", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495853344}, "language": "english", "review": "A tactical RPG with a gimmick of controlling the guns you fire may seem like a strange idea - and it sorta is - but SteamWorld Heist does a good job of hitting the mark while also variating their gameplay enough to remain fresh. Things may burn out near the end but from start to finish Heist satisifes.\n\nSo, quick summary, SteamWorld Heist has you patrolling the stars a la Firefly taking on progressively greater threats, starting from lowly (insane) bandits to the local military-government complex. Along the way you get crazier additions to your crew with their own unique abilities, a crap-load of guns, and many many things to shoot. You enter a ship, you use your weaponry to shoot your enemies and perform bank shots where necessary, you finish an objective, you collect loot, you repeat. A randomized ship to conquer along with random drops that supplement many different playstyles, along with various enemy types and objectives keeps you going along. But eventually the repetition does set in. There is a ton to experience in SteamWorld Heist, but it does repeat the same premise just with slightly different scenarios forcing you to stay on your toes. However, it isn't enough to make it really sting until you make it to the end of your ~10 hour quest which means you're getting a lot of fun game to play with. Heist does a great job with difficulty as well, slowly ramping things up until you can grab better weaponry and hone your skills to avoid quick painful deaths because you were on the wrong side of cover. But that's okay, heists are ten to fifteen minutes each, a failure will only hurt your wallet and some of your free time.\n\nSo is SteamWorld Heist worth your money? I'd say so. If you're a fan of tactical RPGs and need a little more ingame action then you're in luck as Heist is make or break on your ability to judge your aim. But if you want gameplay that's more actually tactical over aiming and praying for the best then you'll be looking for something else. But even so Heist is worth your time for its concept alone and its large spacey world full of unique life.

I could only put down a tentative yes.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Nicely drawn graphics. Every character carry it's own unique feel and personality.\n\n2. Nice soundtrack. I personally thought the Robot band playing at rest stop is quite enjoyable so much so that I found myself lingering in that area for a few moments just enjoying the music.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Too grindy. Partly because when you recruit new members they don't sync up to your current level, so if you want to use them you'll have to painstakingly replay and older mission several times to get them up to speed. Also, the drop is almost completely random (save for the epic swag, which are predetermined); although it didn't causes me any trouble during my playthrough, it's possible to get a bunch of lousy gear which forces you to grind for proper gear in order to advance.\n\n2. Difficulty curve is kind of a joke. It is more challenging, but you only get some bonus experience, and achievements if you're into that sort of thing. so in short, there's not much incentive to play it at any difficulty other than casual. Because if you fail a mission at higher difficulty, there's actually a penalty in place, which will force you to grind even more to earn to earn back the credit.\n\nSummary:\n\nIn many ways, SteamWorld Heist is kind of plays like a 2D version of XCOM, if all the character in XCOM has been replaced with robots. In SteamWorld Heist, the lousy hit chance is replaced with aiming so even if you miss a shot you'll never feel like the game cheated you out of your win. But on the other hand, there's not much ststus effect in SteamWorld Heist so every stage is just a slow push from one end of the map to the other if you're playing on harder difficulty.\n\nIn short. SteamWorld Heist is unique enough to warrant one playthrough.

The great part is that it's not at the sacrifice of gameplay depth.\n\nThere's something to be said about the fun of developing a team composition to optimally take out all the enemies on a ship. You can use less-mobile sniper characters to ricochet projectiles around the ship a million times before it lands between the eyes of an enemy robot, use a tanky melee character to rush down large enemies, and use your captain to support those roles with heals and damage buffs.

Cada uno posee distintas habilidades que van ganando a medida que se les sube de nivel.\nCada mision requiere un numero determinado de unidades por lo que debemos decidir que personajes enviar que tengan habilidades que se puedan complementar o el equipo adecuado a nuestra manera de jugar.\nA primera vista parece un juego muy simple, de hecho lo es\nen los primeros compases, donde no tenemos mas recursos que cubrirnos y disparar, pero rapidamente el juego agrega elementos que lo hacen muy interesante como disparos que rebotan o da\u00f1o en area, fuego amigo, flanqueos, ataques melee,habilidades de soporte etc...\n\n***Lo bueno***\n\n-Graficamente es bastante vistoso, con unos graficos en 2D caricaturescos y con animaciones fluidas.\n-En lo sonoro destaca la musica sobre los efectos, es muy acorde a la estetica del juego y de gran calidad, inclusive trae algunas pistas cantadas.\n-La curva de dificultad es buena.\n-El sentido de progrecion,esta muy bien como se amolda a la curva de dificultad. A medida que avanzamos los combates se hacen mas complicados pero a su vez sentimos que tenemos mas recursos y mecanicas que explotar con cada elemento que se a\u00f1ade.\n-Es muy divertido jugablemente, este es el factor de mas peso.\n-A pesar que se notan algunas influencias como xcom en la forma de movernos o buscar cobertura, o de worms cuando realizamos algun disparo. El conjunto resulta siendo algo original, se sabe distiguir creando su propia escensia.\n\n***Mejorable***\n\n-Podria tener algo mas de variedad en sus misiones, a pesar de que no llega a aburrir.\n-La gestion del inventario podria mejorarse. Los items estan todos juntos y tenemos que posar el cursor para saber quien lo tiene equipado a su vez si queremos equiparlo a otro personaje solo se hace en la pantalla previa a una mision.", "timestamp_created": 1495375763, "timestamp_updated": 1495375763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31882694": {"recommendationid": "31882694", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968491365", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495656823}, "language": "english", "review": "A little grindy and repetetive, but overall great game.

As someone who has never played a single other game from the Steamworld universe (and thus was not particularly interested in the game's overall lore), I must say that I found myself utterly loving every minute of this rusty steampunk space-opera. Steamworld: Heist is an absolutely brilliant amalgamation: it has the atmosphere of Firefly, the gameplay of simplified X-COM (combined with some traditional platformer design), the hand-drawn graphics of a wonderful cartoon and the unmistakable music of \"Steam Powered Giraffe\" integrated brilliantly within the game's scenery. I cannot but recommend.\n\nTO SUM UP: For a game about a bunch of rusty, steam-powered, oil-filled metal tin cans with a particularly uncomprehensible speach patterns cruising through a rather crazy side of the cosmos, Steamworld: Heist certainly has a surprising amount of soul. Should you ever find yourself thinking about trying something new and a little bit different,  pull the metaphorical trigger and give this adventure a shot!

Fun little game, might even be a ''hidden gem'' on steam. Yet my review is negative. Well, Its not really a 'negative' but more a: 'Much room for improvement'. Its a fine turn based game but with so manny little annoyances, it ruins the whole. \n\nThe dialogue and writing is so awefull. I stopped reading anything of dialogue entirely after the first chapter, just 'whatever'. Its not intriguing or interesting in any way. It has those meme references that are supposed to be funny, that really isnt my kind of humor. \n\nSecond of all the game gets the award for the most awefull soundtrack ever. Whenever you enter a bar or safe area some kind of new age music album starts playing that is a mix between Michael Buble and some 1970 American country music. I really feel like they got paid to put that in or that they know these guys who made the music, it doesnt fit the steampunk theme AT ALL. \n\nGameplay wise? Now if you keep playing this at one difficulty level, the trashmobs and default levels are WAY too easy, and bossfights are WAY too hard. Not a fan of that at all. I hate being stuck at a bossfight. Overal gameplay is fine, guns feel really like they do damage with the slow motion effects and one-hit kills. \n\nWhat i'm missing here is that this should be more like FTL. The journey, levels and enemies all randomized. They claim that the levels are 'randomly generated' but its all linear and story driven. I'm also missing upgrades. Yes, you can change the layout of your characters and they will unlock some new (mostly passive) skills, but thats it.

Didn't know I needed one.\n- Steampunk / cowboy / robot / pirate theme. Very nice. \n- Hat collection. (More on that below)\n- Sound, graphics and physics all work in favor of the game's flavor and gameplay. \n- Real swaying aim and ricochet physics. \n(It's on sale at HB right now. No excuse not to try it)\n\nCons - not too bad: \n- Leveling new additions to the crew takes some grinding on old levels, which takes away from the feel of story progress. I'd replay the levels anyway. The issue is pace, and character imbalance, but that goes pretty quickly. \n- Loot is mostly linear. You get a +2 pistol to replace your +1, or it might add a scope, etc. \n\n--\n\nCharacter leveling is great, because it advances the whole game, but the new skills are all predetermined for you. You can't see what they are in advance to see who you want to level first. Better for game balance, but less exciting when one character gets 1 Health, while another gets an extra action every turn. \n\nIt trades an X/Y strategy map for an X/Z map, and it works. It would take away from the game if it were top-down instead of side scrolling. \n\nI didn't get into the hat collection at first. It plays off the aiming and physics really well. When bots are hiding behind barrels, and you try to make a headshot, you may miss slightly and only shoot off their hat in a very cowboy themed shootout style.

And I'll admit, I was skeptical when it said \"Plays best with a Controller\". But my god, this game is fluid, fun, and incredibly endearing.\n\n[b]The Good-Good[/b]\n[list]\n [*]This game immediately caters to both kinds of players that would enjoy this: those that want some loveable steam robots heisting with some witty banter, or those that want the nitty-gritty tactical challenge of acing every mission. There are plenty of difficulties available, allowing the player to (inadvertently) set the level of stress they want to endure in each mission of the game. All the dialogue is skippable if you just mash a button, so if you REALLY can't wait to get back into the action, you're set. But on the other hand, you can take the game leisurely and enjoy the robotic banter.\n [*]On the topic of robotic banter, the story is actually pretty enjoyable, and even skipping dialogue I found myself very fond of a lot of the characters. It's witty, clever, and makes the characters very likeable.\n [*]The aesthetics of the game are incredible. Every background, character, enemy, what-have-you looks incredibly good. \n [*]I was skeptical of a 2D turn-based strategy game at first (how do you incorporate what looks like platforming into a TBS game??) but the gameplay is actually incredibly simple but rewarding. This is not a difficult strategy game to pick up, which rewards the player for getting better at the strategy it [i]does[/i] encourage.\n [*]The music is INCREDIBLE. I'm not much of a fan of steampunk-themed bands, but Steam Powered Giraffe is definitely the right choice for this game. The first time I walked into one of the saloons in the game and realized the music was from an actual band (and one immortalized in the game by playing in said saloon), I found myself looking up the band and singing along to at least Brass Goggles.\n [*]The combat is unique. Most if not all bullets ricochet or can be modified by skills or the weapon your bots use, meaning you can create some impressive trick shots to secure a clutch kill. Sometimes you'll even have the \"WHOAH, I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT BUT IT WAS AWESOME\" kinda thing, which puts a good grin on your face. Plus, you can shoot off an enemies hat and take it. So hats. We love hats.\n[/list]\n\n[b]The So-So[/b]\n[list]\n [*]Honestly, I wouldn't mind having a PvP/Online mode to this game. I can see how balance issues would arise based on item tiers and whatnot, but it would be cool to see it incorporated. Maybe not in a turbo-competitive manner, but something where you could hop in and try to square off against an opponent and maybe snag some hats as rewards and such.

Ich liebte den detailverliebten Comic-Look, ich liebte die witzige Figurengestaltung der Steambots und den dazugeh\u00f6rigen Humor, ich liebte den von Spaghetti-Western inspirierten Soundtrack, und ich liebte diese Mischung aus vertikal gerichtetem Plattformer, Metroidvania und \u201eBoulderDash\u201c-Nachahmung. An sich ein simples Konzept, aber auf seine Weise auch irgendwie grandios. Und leider auch recht kurz. Ich wollte mehr. Ich wollte eine Fortsetzung. Besser gestern als morgen. ;)\nMit der Ank\u00fcndigung des n\u00e4chsten und auf den Namen \u201eSteamWorld Heist\u201c (= SWH) getauften Projekts wurde meine Vorfreude allerdings gebremst. Anfangs. Denn SWH blieb zwar SWD stilistisch treu, wechselte nun jedoch in ein ganz anderes Genre. Zweidimensionale Rundentaktik auf Weltraum-Kreuzern sollte es nun sein, kein Buddeln mehr in tiefsten Minen. Mein Interesse war fast verflogen, doch beim letzten Winter-Sale gab ich mir nen Ruck und packte SWH in den Warenkorb. Nach \u00fcber 30 gespielten Stunden m\u00fcsste ich Image&Form eigentlich um Vergebung bitten, denn mit meiner vorausgegangenen Skepsis/Ablehnung lag ich derart falsch wie noch nie. SWH hat mich wohl noch mehr zum bedingungslosen SteamWorld-Fan gemacht, w\u00e4hrend die Entwickler den Beweis liefern dass sie ihr eigenes Steambot-Universum sogar Genre-\u00fcbergreifend gekonnt zu erweitern wissen.\n\nEs herrschen schwere Zeiten. F\u00fcr Hydrofarmer, Schmuggler, Bergleute \u2013 und auch Cowbots wie Captain Piper Faraday und ihre Crew, denn Wasser ist nach der Zerst\u00f6rung der Erde knapp, und so geh\u00f6rt es zu deren Tagesgesch\u00e4ft Piraten-Raumschiffe zu entern und nur ganz b\u00f6sen Schrottern (= quasi Roboter-Zombies) das wertvolle Nass mit Waffengewalt abzukn\u00f6pfen. Weil jedoch die Schrotter-Plage immer gr\u00f6\u00dfer wird, Diesel-Royalisten vor der Unterdr\u00fcckung von Zivilisten nicht zur\u00fcckschrecken und dazu noch eine fremde wie auch hochgef\u00e4hrliche Alienbot-Rasse in Erscheinung tritt, ziehen Piper und Co. in den Kampf. F\u00fcr Frieden, Freiheit, Gerechtigkeit, \u2026 Und nat\u00fcrlich auch f\u00fcr eine Handvoll Wasser. :-B\n\nDie Story-Kampagne erstreckt sich \u00fcber 3 gro\u00dfe Weltraumkarten, jede davon weist zahlreiche Stationspunkte auf die mit Pipers Schiff zugesteuert werden k\u00f6nnen. Neben Bars und Shops als Einkaufsadresse f\u00fcr allerlei Waffen, Ausr\u00fcstungen und H\u00fcte \u2013 letzteres ist in SteamWorld der allerletzte Mode-Schrei *zwinker-zwinker* \u2013 sind da eben auch jene Schiffe die es zu kapern, deren Mannschaft auszuschalten und die Beute einzusacken gilt. Zu Beginn ist die kampff\u00e4hige Mannschaft einzig auf Piper und ihrem treuen Weggef\u00e4hrten/Matrosen Seabrass beschr\u00e4nkt. Diese vergr\u00f6\u00dfert sich durch Anheuern weiterer Cowbots denen man ab und dann \u00fcber den Weg l\u00e4uft, ausreichend Ruf-Sterne vorausgesetzt. Ruf-Sterne verdient man sich nach jedem gemeistertem Level/Schiff, wobei jeweils ein Maximum von 3 Sternen - abh\u00e4ngig vom Erfolg - erreicht werden kann. Wer eine Level-Quote von 100% erreichen m\u00f6chte muss daf\u00fcr sorgen dass alle ausgew\u00e4hlten Besatzungsmitglieder die Mission \u00fcberleben und ausnahmslos ALLES an vorhandener Schiffsbeute in seine Metallhosentaschen landet. Gleichzeitig ist ein hohes Ruf-Sterne-Konto unabdinglich, da der Zugang zu bestimmten Karten-Gebieten damit freigeschaltet werden m\u00f6chte.\nDie zufallsgenerierten Levels/Schiffe fallen in Gr\u00f6\u00dfendimension und Schwere recht unterschiedlich aus, so variiert auch immer wieder die Anzahl an Charakteren die zum Einsatz kommen d\u00fcrfen. Dabei hat man die freie Wahl zwischen Cowbots mit jeweils eigenem Fachgebiet wie Scharfsch\u00fctzen-Praxis, Erfahrung im Nahkampf oder Handling mit leichten oder schweren Waffen. Gem\u00e4\u00df des Rundentaktik-Regelwerkes steht jeder Figur, ob nun auf Seiten des Spielers oder der CPU-Gegner, ein limitierter Bewegungs-Radius sowie eine Angriffsaktion pro Zug zur Verf\u00fcgung, einschlie\u00dflich individueller Sonderaktionen / Spezial-F\u00e4higkeiten. Barrieren, F\u00e4sser und andere zerst\u00f6rbare Objekte eignen sich als gute Deckung, ebenso bieten undurchdringbare W\u00e4nde je nach Position entsprechenden Schutz vor gegnerischem Direktbeschuss.\n\nBez\u00fcglich der Gefechte muss erw\u00e4hnt werden dass SWH anders funktioniert als \u00fcbliche Rundentaktik-Spiele. Statt computerberechneter Wahrscheinlichkeit-/Zufallstreffer h\u00e4ngen Sieg und Niederlage von der eigenen Zielgenauigkeit ab.\nBei jedem seiner Cowbots muss der Spieler die Waffe manuell, also mit blo\u00dfem Auge auf den Feind ausrichten. Scharfsch\u00fctzengewehre/-pistolen mit Laserpointer-Aufsatz sind hier noch sehr hilfreich, bei allen anderen Waffen ohne Zielvorrichtung vertraut man einzig und allein seiner eigenen Fixiergenauigkeit. Desweiteren spielt auch die Art der Munition eine nicht minder wichtige Rolle; Kugeln und Lasersch\u00fcsse k\u00f6nnen an W\u00e4nden abprallen und bei Beachtung des Einschusswinkels eine Flugbahn annehmen die selbst dann Treffer erm\u00f6glichen wenn ein Gegner kein ideales Frontal-Ziel abgibt, Granaten und andere explosive Geschosse dagegen schie\u00dfen in gekr\u00fcmmten Bahnen heraus und sind darum auch wesentlich ungenauer auf einzelne Gegner anzuvisieren, verursachen daf\u00fcr aber mehr Fl\u00e4chenschaden.\nGeht man siegreich aus einer Mission hervor sammelt jeder eingesetzte Charakter Erfahrungspunkte, mit Aufstieg zur n\u00e4chsten EP-Stufe bekommt dieser au\u00dferdem eine neue Spezial-F\u00e4higkeit spendiert. Auf die Arten der F\u00e4higkeit hat man allerdings keinen Einfluss, da die Rangfolge ihrer Freischaltung fest vorgeschrieben ist.\nSWH und sein Gameplay sind einfach und schnell zu verstehen, aber auch herausfordernd, jedoch nie unfair. Und sollte es mal nicht zu vollen 100% bzw. 3 Ruf-Sternen reichen ist es immer wieder m\u00f6glich den betreffenden Level zu wiederholen. Auch der Umfang kann sich sehen lassen, f\u00fcr den Abschluss der Story im mittlerem von insgesamt 5 Schwierigkeitsgraden und kompletter Ruf-Stern-Anh\u00e4ufung hab ich gut 24 Stunden gebraucht. F\u00fcr nen kleinen Indie-Titel ist das schon ne ganze Menge.\n\nWie es die Einleitung bereits verriet haben Image& Form Games das sympathische SteamWorld-Artwork aus SWD beibehalten, diesen aber aufgrund des Genre-Wechsels ein wenig angepasst. Piper und Co. wirken etwas \u201eerwachsener\u201c, weniger knuffig-s\u00fc\u00df wie Rusty (dessen Sekunden-Gastauftritt man kurz erhaschen kann) und die ganzen anderen SWD-Figuren, die Schiffe und ihre toll animierten Innenr\u00e4ume haben ein leicht d\u00fcsteres Ambiente, doch ansonsten hat es die typisch-heitere Aufmachung und die gewohnte knallbunte Farbgebung. Der Sound w\u00e4hrend der Gefechte hat ordentlich Wumms und die witzige wie multilingual untertitelte Fantasie-Roboter-Sprache passt wunderbar zum Szenario. Am meisten aber noch gef\u00e4llt die musikalische Untermalung des Ganzen:\nDer Soundtrack ist fabelhaft gew\u00e4hlt und situativ jederzeit passend, und in Bars sowie nach abgeschlossenen Endboss-K\u00e4mpfen steuert die Band \u201eSteam Powered Giraffe\u201c \u2013 ja, die heisst wirklich so :-B \u2013 unglaublich schmissige Songs bei, sowas w\u00fcrde man bei einem kleinen Titel wie SWH gar nicht vermuten. Selbst mit dem Wissen dass dieses Spiel von der EU (!) kofinanziert wurde.\n\nFazit:\nSuper-spa\u00dfige Rundentaktik-Action im audio-visuell bezaubernden Gewand und mit einem sch\u00f6nen Schuss Humor. Spielerherz, was willst du mehr? \nAlso, liebe Leutz von Image&Form Games, wenn ihr das hier liest, seid versichert, egal was ihr jetzt und in Zukunft an neuen SteamWorld-Ablegern in der Mache habt\u2026 SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!!! :D", "timestamp_created": 1494939570, "timestamp_updated": 1495000335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.712398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31772614": {"recommendationid": "31772614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118335242", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 832, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495511291}, "language": "english", "review": "Praise Jeebuz if you have the cash please purchase this game, it's by far the most enjoyable strategy I've ever played.

The steambotish art style is top notch. Although thereare just a few music tracks available (played at stations/bars/boss fight endings), they fit well well into the world and are a pleasure to listen to.\n\nThe tactical gameplay reminds me a little bit of Woms (as this is only one tactical turn-based game which I could play for hours ), each character is unique with its own set of skills and can have 1 weapon and 2 utility items. I found it very satisfying to try to fit  most suitable items to characters and to level those characters up in order to unlock their unique skills. It is also very important to create a great team by carefully considering each character traits.  I highly suggest to experiment and try to combine the best team with the best gear, but be carefull as your dream team might not be the best choice in every situation.\n\nThe level desing is randomly generated and it happend only once that I was put in a very very bad starting postion.  In some levels you need to complete the objectives within given number of turns and missing the deadline usually does not end in a game over but the threat level rises and the bad guys receive some backup in a form of more mobs or automated turrerts.\n\nI am really just a newbie in tactical games but regardless of this I found the \"experienced\" difficulty to give me a nice  and fun challenge.\n\nI do not simply play tactical turn based games, but when I do, they must be hellishly good and fun to play!", "timestamp_created": 1494615272, "timestamp_updated": 1494617538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31680908": {"recommendationid": "31680908", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970348441", "num_games_owned": 561, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488032720}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a great game.

The storyline isn't that good but hush now, the narrator sometimes pops up with little story bits that are so well done, with kinda the odd charm of uh, y'know those old infomercials? Them.

Questa volta ci sposteremo nell'ambito spaziale e lo scopo del gioco sar\u00e0 quello di gestire un manipolo di soldati robots e, come in molti classici, sventare i piani dei malvagi di turno per diventare cos\u00ec da ricercati (in quanto trattasi di pirati spaziali) ad eroi dell'universo.\n\nTRAMA\nLa trama \u00e8 semplice e lineare, rappresentabile come un segmento che v\u00e0 da A a B. Dovremo infatti compiere varie missioni attraverso le quali ricaveremo informazioni e metteremo i bastoni tra le ruote ai nostri antagonisti, fino ad affrontarli nelle varie boss fight. \n\nGAMEPLAY\nCi troviamo di fronte a un gioco tattico a turni 2D. I personaggi saranno disposti sulle navi che andremo ad assaltare su pi\u00f9 piani, dovremo tenere conto della pavimentazione, di barili esplosivi e di ogni possibile ostacolo.\nLo scopo delle missioni pu\u00f2 variare di volta in volta : alle volte dovremo sopravvivere un determinato numero di turni, altre volte dovremo prendere dei dati, altre ancora sterminare tutti i nemici all'interno del veicolo volante.\nIl numero di robots utilizzabili varier\u00e0 da uno a quattro a seconda del tipo di missione.\nMossa interessante la possibilit\u00e0 di far rimbalzare i proiettili per poter raggiungere un nemico all'apparenza in copertura.\nHo anche apprezzato tantissimo la caratterizzazione a livello di design ma sopratutto sul piano di gioco del nostro squadrone. Ogni personaggio utilizzabile infatti (molti di essi si aggiungeranno al team nel corso del viaggio) dispone di abilit\u00e0 esclusive e ognuno \u00e8 specializzato in diverse categorie di armi. Questo spinger\u00e0 il giocatore a provarli un po' tutti e ad utilizzarne alcuni in un certo tipo di missione piuttosto che altri.Nessuno verr\u00e0 trascurato insomma [spoiler]o almeno non completamente[/spoiler].\n\nTIRANDO LE SOMME\n+ Gameplay : Intuitivo, facile, divertente\n+ Musiche : Le canzoni sono fantastiche ! presenti nei vari bar spaziali e al termine delle boss fight le ho trovate molto divertenti e piene di energia ! Azzeccate in pieno alcune allo stile western/steampunk.\n+Personaggi : Bel design, ben fatti e differenziati a livello di skills.\n+Narrazione : La trama \u00e8 quella che \u00e8, tuttavia lo stile narrativo \u00e8 divertemente e scorrevole.\n+Livello di difficolt\u00e0 variabile: [u]E lo si sente eccome ![/u]\n\n-Trama semplice e scontata \n-Il gioco \u00e8 durato una decina di ore ma, vedendo la tipologia delle missioni, avrei voluto fosse un po' pi\u00f9 lungo o che avesse un percorso pi\u00f9 libero e meno lineare.\n \nDimenticavo un ultimo punto, lo metterei come neutrale : [b]CAPPELLI !! [/b] \nTutti i robots avranno in testa dei [b]CAPPELLI[/b], dai pi\u00f9 semplici ai pi\u00f9 strambi. Inutile dire che saranno dei collezionabili e che saranno veramente tanti. L'idea non mi \u00e8 dispiaciuta, ma avessero avuto un effetto secondario sul piano statistiche sarebbe stato un ottimo motivo in pi\u00f9 per procurarceli. Cos\u00ec tanto per indossarli non mi dice tantissimo.\n\nConcludo dicendo che ho gradito veramente tanto questo gioco. Se siete fan dei tactic games dovete giocarci assolutamente, tuttavia, dato lo stile colorato e lo stile narrativo vivace, mi sento di consigliarlo un po' a tutti.\n\n-Al", "timestamp_created": 1494187787, "timestamp_updated": 1494188037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522466", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31479802": {"recommendationid": "31479802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062754235", "num_games_owned": 529, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490385991}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buen juego.

Great characters, sound and graphics, and a very smooth, polished playing experience. The soundtrack is great too.\n\nIt makes some compromises in complexity (this is not quite XCOM) but the simplicity is deceptive. I had to dial down the difficulty to Normal after failing to complete missions a little too often. There is not a lot of room for mistakes on the higher difficulty levels, but you can also change difficulty on a per mission basis, so it is quite versatile.\n\nCharacter progression is very rigid. Your XP is spent automatically and you are awarded with new abilities and enhancements at a rate of one per level gained. There is no choices involved. It is still quite satisfying to acheive levels and try out new abilities and enjoy the breathing room that gaining some health points gives you.\n\nInventory management can be a bit of a pain, all objects are kept in a central pool and you can assign items from the pool before each job. Characters remember what they were equipped with last though, so you are not forced to redistribute items every time. It's a little different from normal RPG type games where each player has their own constant inventory. That being said, even if you have six steambots to choose from, you only need enough armor/weapons to equip the three or four that will be used in any given battle.\n\nThere is a good variety of weapon types and accessories. They make it very difficult to choose what your bots will bring with them (they each carry one weapon and have 2 'utility' spots that can be repair kits, armor (bonus to starting health), or accessory weapons like grenades). There are also other items that enhance your abilities but you can't bring it all with you each time. How I longed for one more carry space...\n\nI seem to rely on a core team of bots that is successful most of the time, so I find myself backtracking and replaying older levels to farm XP for the other bots just to keep everyone in range of each other. Everyone has their speciality, and there is tradeoffs.\n\nThe missions generally involve retrieving water and other treasures, killing certain enemies, and getting out alive. It can be frustrating dealing with wave after wave of enemy reinforcements when you are trying to evacuate a ship, and have one of your bots get sniped just before making it out safely. Paying attention to the environment, the cover available and the enemy turret locations can mean the difference between life and death. \n\nThe game is not long (15-20 hours apparently), but the ships are randomly generated so there is reasonable replayability. I have found myself going back in and trying different strategies on a few of them.  There is no manual save, it autosaves quite often and will tell you how long it's been since the last save when you try to quit (great touch). \n\nAll in all, it's highly polished, charming, and makes it easy to get a quick fix or play a long session.  \n\nLooking forward to Steamworld Dig 2!!!", "timestamp_created": 1491457324, "timestamp_updated": 1491694940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30970878": {"recommendationid": "30970878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217434716", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491488605}, "language": "english", "review": "Such an amazing game!

There are ten characters to recruit, each with their own abilities, and a whole lot of different items to find, which are mostly well-balanced. The sound and music were better than I expected, and the graphics are stylish.\n\nThe story is simple but well-delivered, and a playthrough where you try to recruit and level up everyone should take about 25 hours, maybe more if you go for maximum reputation. If you really want a challenge, the game keeps track of the total number of turns and losses, and your reputation, and scores you at the end of the game. Getting a top score requires beating every map with max reputation and no losses, and doing so in a minimum of turns (preventing you from grinding to overlevel).

SteamWorld Heist is a 2D strategy tactics game (Think X-COM, Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem, etc.).  You manage a group of characters, each with distinct abilities, in turn-based battles against a group of enemies, each with their own strenghts and weaknesses.  Manage your inventory and earn experience in order to customize your characters better to give them and edge on the battlefield.\n\nUnlike the previously mentioned games, though, in which battles depend quite a bit on luck (look for the infamous picture of a soldier in X-COM having a shotgun pointed right at an alien's face with a 98% chance of hitting and still missing), battles here depend purely on skill.  Realistically, your characters hand don't stay completely still while aiming (though perhaps less realistically, considering they're robots), so it's up to you if they hit the target or not.  Also, some characters attack better from afar, others do more damage from the back, others can't attack after moving, and so on.  There's a lot of characters, abilities and weapons to juggle, and you can set your team as you like it, according to your preferred playstyle.  You're never forced to use a character you're not comfortable with if you have others at your disposal.\n\nAt times the game might infuriate you.  Most stages are randomly created through a procedural algorithm, and that means sometimes they'll be easier to handle (for instance, sometimes you might find a couple of small rooms with one or two enemies each and sometimes it'll be a large room where all congregate).  Losing or aborting a battle at most difficulties will make you lose half of your hard-earned cash.  On the plus side, re-entering the same stage might turn out to have it reconfigured on an easier way.  You might get angry and rage-quit the game at some point (I know I have), but a few minutes later you'll be drawn to the game again, because it IS that much fun.\n\nThe game includes a New Game+ option, which is always a nice thing.

Some might not like that, others will like it for cutting out all the padding and percentage hit chance (yea, no 99% misses) and bringing a polished game without anything to truly hate.\n \n    [*]Let me say that the story isn\u2019t something to remember. The gameplay is what matters here (Just like that XCOM game, ey?)\n\n    [*]The setting is steam powered robots that you control, with mostly linear missions and some challenges occasionally. You get water as your currency to buy new gear, weapons, storage space, and recruit. \n\n    [*]There are about 5 classes with 2 for class having 2 robots you can recruit each with different overall abilities. This means that every character is unique and has a use and can offer lots of compositions. You level them all up to a max level. This can\u2019t be done in one run. Towards the end, I stuck with the same 4 characters, hitting max level within the last hour of playing since I mixed it up a lot in throughout the game.\n\n    [*]The abilities your characters get are great too, with every new level being a useful upgrade to your character. There is no percentages, just straight health, movement or damage increases; or new abilities (also improving said abilities). Combat is aimed manual by you, so no hit chance. It\u2019s all your trick shots and skill. Love this neat mechanic\n\n\n    [*]Your characters can only wield certain weapons. They are the typical gun styles, handguns, sharpshooter, heavy, assault. Lots of your projectiles ricochet, meaning a straight path isn\u2019t always needed to hit your target. The progression of gear is great. After almost every mission you will find a new toy to use, or be able to go and buy one. This is good as the game will never get stale if you\u2019re worried about that.\n\n\n    [*]The difficulty is reasonable with 5 different choices, with the middle being perfect as it was good enough for me. You can even change it with every mission if you\u2019re having a hard time. If you fail a mission you lose half of your currency. This might sound harsh, but you can replay any previous mission, so you can make it all back. The AI and enemy difficulty progression is great too, starting with basic enemies with no advanced weapons, gear or tactics. Toward the end you get enemies with shields, teleportation, bombs and charging weapons, and getting better at ricochet hits.\n\n    [*]The music is perfect for the theme, having a rustic, folk rock sound, played by a steampunk band called Steam Powered Giraffe, with my favorite songs being \u201cBrass Goggles\u201d and \u201cHoneybee\u201d with more on the album for the game. Half of them are the band\u2019s songs just repurposed for the game somehow. I would say a lot of them are good enough and since it has lyrics, some might enjoy them even more to listen outside the game. I know I\u2019ll be getting some of these songs.\n\n    [*] Overall the game is a shining example that a small team can make a unique turn based strategy game, fill it with charm and great music to fit the theme, giving a great experience that is cheap, short and not padded at all. This game was hard to find anything that some might hate or get annoyed by. With their previous game the robot voices were nowhere near as annoying. Great job on making a superb game.

All ya need is a bot with a hammer for a penis and you got Captain Malcolm Reynolds. Pop culture references aside, Heist is a homage to westerns, just substitute horses with spaceships.\n\nWhile the game does have an amazing opening sequence that sets the scene for you, I will do my best to explain the story. After the Earth exploded, bots began to mine moisture for survival. You play a rag tag group of outlaw steambots on the fringes of space. Dealing with gangs, Royalists and all sorts of seedy characters. The setting is simple but eloquent. You play the captain of one these outlaw gangs and some bots begin to muscle in on your territory. Thus the Firefly-esque adventure begins with you taking up the mantle of the common people and making off with some decent loot as a benefit.\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with the universe of Steamworld, I highly recommend playing Steamworld Dig as that is a fantastic title all on its own. Aside from being an awesome action/platformer it also gives insights into why Earth explodes.\n\nSteamworld Heist on the other hand does a dramatic pivot from its predecessor. Where you controlled a single bot and primarily worried about mining, this time you steal, shoot, and control a whole squad. It was definitely one of the things that impressed me with the developer Image & Form. Instead of sticking with what they knew and had already learned they decided to take the series in a whole other direction and genre. It takes some moxie for that kind of thing and hats off to them for pulling it off.\nAt its most simple, Heist is a turn based strategy game that puts you behind the gun.\n\nAiming is by far Heists defining feature and what makes it fun. Trick shots, bouncing grenades, and shooting your enemies hat off is the bread and butter of this game. It\u2019s satisfying every time when you bounce your sniper round off five walls and hit a bot in the back of the head.\n\nThe way the mission structure works equates to a train robbery. You crew boards the enemy vessel with a given set of objectives, steal, plunder, kill, deactivate, the usual stuff. You go through compartments, collecting loot and dealing with the ships inhabitants. Usually you have to make a speedy exit via escape pod at the end of missions. Difficulty antes up with giving the enemy better guns, turrets and improving aim. The XCOM mechanic kicks in with tactical placements of your crew and a cover  mechanic. While flanking enemies is possible, it tends to be difficult as all levels are procedurally generated. Additionally there are also classes and abilities that are reminiscent of XCOM.\n\nWhile there are not many buttons to worry, about the game does feature full controller support and comes recommended. Reason being is that the aiming mechanic can be a bit tricky especially if you don\u2019t have a scope. Otherwise there isn\u2019t too much to fuss with, you move your troops, fire, and use special abilities. Every character you have/recruit has their own unique class and weapon set. As you complete missions they gain experience which unlocks new abilities. Guns range from light pistols, shotguns, to heavy weapons like rocket launchers.\nThis mixing of classes and abilities makes every mission unique as most characters have their own way of approaching things.\n\nThankfully, all missions are repeatable and there are several different kinds of difficulty depending on your skill level. These raise the stakes when it comes to loot/XP but also increases the punishment for failure. Unlike XCOM though, you don\u2019t lose your Steambots permanently but just lose water, the games currency.\n\nBetween heists you have the galaxy map that you use to fly around. Steamworld Heists limits content you can access either through the story or by a reputation system that is given in stars. It comes off feeling a little bit like a mobile game as certain missions cannot be done until you achieve a certain star count. As you unlock more areas you gain access to bars/shops that let you recruit new Steambots and buy weapons/accessories. All of these mechanics flow into each other very smoothly but the game isn\u2019t spotless.\n\nThe only issue I found lies in inventory management. This can become quite a headache. Despite having a huge ship, you only are allowed to carry a limited number of items. Your storage can be expanded upon later in the game but I always felt like I was running behind on space. While all bots can share accessories/guns, you end up having quite a few unique weapons/items or double up cause you might want two of the same class on a mission. Thankfully you can sell items at any point in space but I just would\u2019ve enjoyed a bit more freedom in this area. This is magnified and very frustrating at the end of missions constantly deciding what I wanted to keep and sell. Preventing progression in the game.\n\nWhile I enjoyed Heist\u2019s gameplay quite a bit it does become a bit repetitive eventually. Even though the game breaks things up with different objectives and a boss fight occasionally, you eventually end up in a slog of just upgrading guns/accessories. I wouldn\u2019t say the game failed to my hold my attention but it didn\u2019t sweep me off my feet. Unlike Steamworld Dig that I played obsessively until I beat it. I think Heist is best enjoyed causally and slowly.\nWhat drew my attention and love about this game series is its style.\n\nThis is something that matches its predecessors and improves upon significantly. I am constantly surprised how well Robots and Western themes just blend together. Every Steambot has an incredible amount of personality to them. From the charming Piper, whose more heart then metal to background characters like bartenders and merchants. When I docked with the Saloon and found a steambot band playing some really awesome tunes, I couldn\u2019t stop smiling. It\u2019s little moments like these that enhances Steamworld. Enemies, allies alike all have their own unique style of ships, weapons, and detail abounds.\n\nObviously there aren\u2019t rendered clouds to gawk at or 60FPS Cup o\u2019 noodle but that doesn\u2019t stop Steamworld from feeling like a thriving and fun universe. Things are the same when it comes to combat and more action oriented scenes. Lasers sizzle, bullets zing, and bots crunch or scatter into pieces when they die.\n\nI have no fault with the visuals or sound department of Steamworld Heist. The music is great and I never got tired of it. There were plenty of times the music actually surprised with me a jaunty tune. It isn\u2019t all that surprising that you can purchase the soundtrack as well. The sound effects all had their proper amount of gravitas to them and made the actions more visceral.\n\nThere is plenty to give the game quite a bit of replay value. Like I mentioned earlier there are many difficulty settings that keep things fresh if you find it too easy. The game does feature Steam Achievements and cards. There is also some additional DLC that adds more weapons, missions, and a new crew member. Depending on your skill level the game could take anywhere from ten to twenty hours of gameplay.\nFrom a game development standpoint, It takes balls to try something completely new.\n\nMost of the time you improve upon a formula and do the best at it to make more money. This was something completely unexpected and I appreciated Steamworld Heist for what it is. It\u2019s fun, smooth, and well made. I hope this isn\u2019t the last we see of the Steamworld universe and I can\u2019t wait to see what the developer cooks up next. As for Heist, if you enjoy strategy games with a bit of a casual nature I recommend this title easily.

Characters move and act much like XCOM soldiers, but on a 2D plane with a messload of steampunk robots. There's no base building or anything like that, however. There are various levels of difficulty, and it can be changed mid-game, so it's not quite as unforgiving as XCOM can be.\n\nThere's some RPG lite mechanics intertwined through this, with loot and experience driving the progression of your crew. Missions take place on ships with (more often than not) randomized layouts, and each mission has various objectives and enemy assortments. Usually you'll be taking two or three robots on a mission, but occasionally you will limited to one or be allowed to bring four. Unlike XCOM, when your characters die, they only forfeit any earned experience for the level.\n\nNormal gameplay revolves around your crew's turn alternating with the enemy. Enemy ranks are usually dolled out slowly by opening ship doors or setting off alarms. Combat is straight forward: you aim your gun at the enemy and fire. Neither you or your enemies can dodge attacks normally, so taking cover is the only defense (aside from HP increasing items, anyway). Weapons don't tend to have laser sights unless they are \"marksmen\" style weapons, but lining up a shot isn't difficult at short or medium ranges. Most bullets and projectiles bounce, allowing you to make trick shots that bounce around cover or around corners.\n\nAll the different crew members have a different assortment of abilities, with some crossover skills between some characters, leaving a rather well-rounded group. None of the characters are useless, though some are better suited for mobility or taking hits. Each crew member can be utilize a weapon (most characters are proficient with one or two types of guns), two accessories and a hat, which is cosmetic. Weapons, accessories and currency are found by picking up loot items in the levels that are placed at the start. Hats are either purchased from some shops, or stolen from enemies by grazing their heads with a projectile. Enemies do not drop loot, nor do they give experience when killed, so farming kills is only useful for farming rare hats.\n\nIn between the combat, players use a map to pick missions or go to hubs/shops. It's sort of like Super Mario World, where you have to complete levels in order to progress down paths on the map. These hubs are mostly for story, hiring crew members and buying hats and equipment.\n\nThe game offers a new game plus mode that allows you to use any characters at the start of the game at the cost of all your equipment and experience. There's DLC that adds a new character, some missions and some hats, and those are peppered throughout the game (and are equally excellent). You can easily spend as little as 10 hours but as many as 30 on a playthrough, depending on how thorough you are.\n\nThe game's got a really snazzy art style that looks beautiful at high frame rates, and there's a subtle parallax effect on all the environments that's really neat to look at. The writing is pretty funny at times and not particularly verbose. For reference: there is no voice acting in the game, but it's not really needed anyway.\n\nI kind of felt bad for getting this in a bundle, because $15 for a game like this is way more than fair.", "timestamp_created": 1488654335, "timestamp_updated": 1488654335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578230", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30304616": {"recommendationid": "30304616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078653098", "num_games_owned": 2375, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486755746}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Historia: Muy sencillita, pero cumple (7)\n\nJugabilidad: Estrat\u00e9gica y divertida.

Il gioco segue lo stile classico dei giochi strategici a turni, ovvero la possibilit\u00e0 di muoveri entro  un certo limite di caselle ed eseguire azione come sparare, trovarsi una copertura ecc durante il proprio turno. Le due caratteristiche che per\u00f2 lo differenziano dai classici del genere \u00e8 la scelta di adottare il 2D e il sistema di combattimento. Quest'ultimo Infatti nella maggior parte dei giochi la traiettoria dei proiettili e la possibilt\u00e0 di successo di un attacco sono gestiti in automatico in base alle caratteristiche dei personaggi, in Steamworld Heist invece \u00e8 il giocatore a mirare e dunque a decretare il successo di una determinata azione.Il gioco presenta anche una piccola parte manageriale che ci servir\u00e0 a gestire l'equipaggiamento degli steambot prima di ogni missione.Proprio l'equipaggiamento \u00e8 vitale per aumentare le possibilit\u00e0 di sopravvivenza ed \u00e8 possibile raccoglierlo tramite i vari bottini presenti nelle missioni o comprare armi nuove e accessori nei bar spaziali  con la valuta di gioco (l'acqua).Ultimo elemento sono i cappelli,hanno un fine esclusivamente estetico ma sar\u00e0 molto divertente cercare di raccoglierli tutti ed equipaggiarli sui propri steambot.\nTirando le somme SteamWorld Heist \u00e8 un gioco che anche se si rif\u00e0 ai classici del genere sa essere molto innovativo grazie ad un combat system solido e divertente, una componente gestionale ben riuscita e ad un'ottima soundtrack.

I got it bundled in the most recent Humble Monthly, which I had picked up pretty much for X-COM 2 alone. But once I poked at this one curiously, I kept at it until I had completely finished. \n\nSpeaking of X-COM, a comparison is fitting. With a lot of similar rules, you can apply some of the very same strategies here as you do there. Shooting or sprinting ends your turn, but you can move once then shoot. Full cover is better than half cover. Enemies get a free turn to move once they see you. And so on. \n\nUnlike the X-COM games though, numbers will never make you miss. With manual aiming for all shots you take, you only miss through your own bad aim or positioning. A lot of weapons can ricochet off walls and cover to pull off some fancy trick shots if you line it up right, too. Which feels pretty awesome to get right. For the most part, when enemies can hit you they will, though their aim seems to have a bit of randomness to it, meaning you can get lucky misses or unlucky hits from afar. \n\nAlso unlike X-COM, there's no overarching doom timer pressuring you to beat the game fast enough. Nor are there save slots - it autosaves every few turns, so mistakes stick with you. Thankfully, the only penalty for party member loss is lost XP, or lost money if you lose them all in one mission. You're also allowed to grind completed missions for money and XP if you're having trouble, but it's not necessary to win. \n\nThere are numerous party members to recruit, each with their own class, skills, and preferred weapon types. You don't get to make your own characters, but there's customization in the form of gear. And hats. Piper and her crew are a likeable enough bunch of robotic rogues to push me through to the end, though the plot's fairly straightforward 'fight the bad guys' kind of stuff. It lacks voice acting, but that's fine in my book. \n\nIt was a good challenge at the middle difficulty, called \"experienced\", but rarely frustrating. Bosses can seem like huge difficulty spikes at first, but didn't usually take me more than two tries to get right without any losses. \n\nThe soundtrack is also enjoyable, especially since bosses get their own \"boss defeated!\" victory song thanks to nerdy band Steam Powered Giraffe. Who I've only recently discovered and I love the dorks. Combat music on the other hand can get repetitive, but that's a minor flaw. \n\nI can't think of much to complain about here. It's a charming game with style. It has a good idea to add to the turn-based strategy formula. It feels and sounds good. There's plenty of content, but it doesn't overstay its welcome or require you to grind. It's challenging, but not unfair.

You control a small team of so-called steambots with unique abilities, in small, tactical confrontations against enemy bots, where you have to kill the opposition, grab the loot, and get out. \n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThere is a story present here, but it is rather underplayed and not the main focus of the game. You're essentially just finding new opposition with every chapter, and the script focuses on what you're doing to muck up their plans/steal their stuff. There is some enjoyment to be had with the story, but don't buy it if that's the only thing you're interested in. \n\n[h1] Presentation [/h1]\nThe presentation on display is really damn impressive considering this is a game originating from the 3DS. The game runs gracefully out of the box, and supports 60+ herz framerates without any tinkering in the cfg. files whatsoever. This is genuinely more impressive than a lot of triple A games that I've played. And don't get me started on the graphics. The 2d art here is brimming with detail and, just, pure effort. Every pipe, valve and rusty backdrop has been gracefully drawn, and are beautifully colored. Animations are superb as well.\n\n[h1] Gameplay\t[/h1]\nAs mentioned, this is a turn based strategy game, rather similar to XCOM. You are given a set distance you can move with a character; move a short distance and you can fire your gun afterwards, but if you move further, you will need to fold until the next turn. However, where Heist differs, is with its ditching of certain chance-based actions common in other strategy games. One example being aiming and shooting, which is done manually by using the mouse/joystick. This eliminates lots of frustration, as most deaths are your own fault, because of your poor aim. Attacking like this is incredibly entertaining, especially since you can bounce bullets off of walls, resulting in some awesome trickshots. \n\nIn addition to this extra layer of gameplay, you have access to a set of teammates you can bring with you on a heist. They can specialize in heavy weapons, sniping, punching, and my personal favorite, flanking. You need to play around these quirks and use positions wisely, like placing the heavy on a top floor, or placing the flanker far ahead, as to make it easier to get behind the enemy and deal extra damage. The gameplay is deep, but simple and easy to learn. And most importantly, the game is fun, incredibly so. Hitting next to impossible shots, blowubg up 3 guys next to an explosive barrel, or figuring out new strategies or abilities is extraordinarily rewarding and entertaining. \n\n\n[h1] Flaws [/h1]  \nThere's an inventory system present here, deciding how many weapons/items you can have a hold of at any-one time. The problem is that it's incredibly harsh in terms of space, only allowing a very small amount of items to be stored. You can upgrade the availible space, but they get exponentially more expensive with every purchase. Deleting items almost after every mission got a little tedious and annoying. \n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nThis is a criminally underrated game, considering the overwhelming quality and effort present here. I plead you to give this game a try, even if you're new to turn-based games. SteamWorld Heist puts an enjoyable twist on a solid foundation, and succeeds with flying colors, and is 100% worth a purchase.", "timestamp_created": 1488135391, "timestamp_updated": 1488135391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479452", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30191743": {"recommendationid": "30191743", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961401476", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488086189}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't expect anything out of this game, and downloaded it on a whim after hearing its named mentioned by a streamer.

Buttiamoci dentro un po' di XCom, un po' di Worms e una spolveratina di un qualsiasi RPG a sviluppo lineare. Mentre cuoce a fuoco lento mettiamo su un bel CD degli \"Steam Powered Giraffe\" (cercateli su Youtube: potrebbero piacervi) o qualche puntata di [i]Firefly[/i]. Dopo un paio d'ore... voilat! Steamworld Heist \u00e8 servito.\n\n[h1]IL GIOCO[/h1]\nLa piccola tramettina dei Cowbot pirati-spaziali e i simpatici dialoghi tra personaggi fanno da contorno a uno strategico steam-punk che \u00e8 pi\u00f9 profondo di quanto non sembri, ma per rendersene conto \u00e8 necessario alzare il livello di difficolt\u00e0 ed allenarsi con la pistola.\nGli incarichi d'affrontare sono montati in una struttura ad albero e si alternano a negozi d'armi, cappellifici e bar (in cui troveremo immancabilmente gli Steam Powered Giraffe in concerto, con una canzone diversa per ogni location).\nLa mappa di ogni missione \u00e8 random, diversa ogni volta che ci giocate, ma l'obiettivo rimarr\u00e0 inalterato: recuperare un tesoro, distruggere un generatore, eliminare un nemico o persino un Boss. \nScelta la difficolt\u00e0 e i personaggi che prenderanno parte al colpo (ciascuno dotato di propri poteri, dati fisici e abilit\u00e0), li si potr\u00e0 armare ad arte per poi buttarsi nella mischia. Gli scontri sono a turni: prima i vostri robot e poi il nemico. Ogni turno \u00e8 alla XCom: ogni personaggio ha due azioni, una di movimento e l'altra di attacco o ancora movimento. La peculiarit\u00e0 sta nel fatto che la mira non \u00e8 automatica, e come nella serie di Worms, avere una buona mira \u00e8 importante quanto essere strategici nei movimenti.\nSe la missione sar\u00e0 superata con successo ogni Cowbot sopravvissuto avr\u00e0 dei punti esperienza utili per salire di livello, sbloccare abilit\u00e0 o migliorare i propri dati. Quello che invece guadagnerete voi sar\u00e0 un certo voto in stelle, che andr\u00e0 ad aumentare la vostra celebrit\u00e0 in quella zona della galassia. Maggiore la celebrit\u00e0, maggiore la quantit\u00e0 di armi e oggetti che potrete comprare nei negozi grazie ai tesori e al denaro trovato. Occhio per\u00f2 a non finire lo spazio nell'inventario! Saperlo gestire \u00e8 molto importante ed \u00e8 buona norma tentare di ampliarlo non appena se ne ha l'occasione.\nE se la missione va male? Scatta la punizione (a patto di giocare almeno a difficolt\u00e0 normale): perderete met\u00e0 dei vostri soldi per ricostruire i soldati distrutti. Ma non disperate: quando sarete sul lastrico vi verranno ricostruiti gratuitamente.\nE poi ci sono i cappelli...\nIl vezzo di ogni cowbot \u00e8 il suo cappello. Potrete comprare cappelli in giro per il cosmo, ma anche sparare a quelli che portano i nemici per poi raccoglierli e aggiungerli alla vostra collezione. I cappelli non fanno niente! Non migliorano nulla n\u00e9 fanno guadagnare poteri. Sono solo cappelli... ma MOLTO alla moda e altamente collezionabili. ;-)\n\n[h1]S\u00cc, OK, MA IN SOLDONI?[/h1]\nCome ho detto, Steamworld Heist \u00e8 semplice in superficie, ma assolutamente impegnativo non appena si decide di aumentare la difficolt\u00e0. Qualcuno pu\u00f2 criticare la linearit\u00e0 nello sviluppo dei personaggi, ma il pi\u00f9 delle volte la libert\u00e0 negli RPG \u00e8 fittizia: nelle varie situazioni la scelta pi\u00f9 logica \u00e8 una sola. I game designer ci accecano con gli specchietti del \"libero arbitrio\" e il pi\u00f9 delle volte la fanno franca.\nQui non ci sono specchietti. Vuoi per ampliare il target e non intimorire i neofiti, vuoi per arrivare al sodo della strategia, ogni eroe sblocca un'abilit\u00e0 specifica al level-up, ed \u00e8 il loro accoppiamento nelle missioni nonch\u00e9 la nostra abilit\u00e0 nello sfruttare quello che abbiamo ci\u00f2 che fa la differenza. Una missione difficile pu\u00f2 diventare semplicissima se si scelgono i giusti Cowbot con i giusti poteri e li si rifornisce con i giusti ammennicoli. Il grinding \u00e8 quindi IMMANCABILE se vogliamo vincere e la randomizzazione delle missioni gioca a nostro favore (e contro la noia).\nRiguardo il perdere met\u00e0 del nostro gruzzoletto al fallimento di missione, \u00e8 un sistema per far girare l'economia: spendendo si perderanno meno soldi al fallimento (mi piace vedere il bicchiere mezzo pieno). ;-)\n\nDa parte mia Steamworld Heist \u00e8 un gioco assolutamente consigliato, a patto di abbracciare la sua apparente semplicit\u00e0 come un trampolino per le difficolt\u00e0 pi\u00f9 alte e le strategie pi\u00f9 fini. PREPARE FOR BOARDING!!!\n\n[h1]NEWGAME+ NOTA BENE![/h1]\nDopo la fine del gioco, sulla mappa apparir\u00e0 un \"buco nero\" che vi permetter\u00e0 di iniziare una nuova partita da zero alla difficolt\u00e0 che preferite.

On board this spaceship, we will experience an epic adventure full of twists, in a real war with robots and space cowbots. Are you ready for a memorable adventure?\n\nIn SteamWorld Heist we control Captain Piper, who will travel the stars to save his race of steam-powered robots. During the journey the player loot and perform various types of missions, which are focused on battles. In the meantime you will also need to recruit teammates to fight alongside you and manage the gear of your crew. While In the bars, which are one of the places where we improve weapons, items and recruit warriors, you can also find the Steam Powered Giraffe band playing. This group is responsible for all the soundtrack of the game - a soundtrack of the best quality, by the way, with both cheerful and intimist songs.\n\nThe game is very similar to XCOM, as far as tactical gameplay is concerned, as well as the movement system, which allows us to walk a stretch to then shoot (or use a skill) or sprint without extra actions. But, unlike XCOM, we are not in the hands of the Random Number Generator (RNG), that is, the chance to miss or hit a shot is totally in the hands of the player. Some weapons have bouncing bullets, as well as grenades and other devices, which gives a Worms climate. Like Worms, it is possible to achieve unexpected and surprising results that go beyond targeting straight, which makes performance on the artillery part critical to success.\n\nThe world of SteamWorld Heist is divided into three parts, which are three large maps with various missions within them. The first part is the worst of all, with little variety in the missions, a lot of repetition and some unfair enemies for the beginning of the game, like a giant robot with an armored shield. This may discourage you a little, but if you persist, the game improves drastically from the second part onwards, with an excellent grand finale on the last boss, which is by far the most stressful mission and requires a lot of strategy to win. On the difficulty I played (Experienced - which is equivalent to normal), it took just over 12 hours to finish everything. What's cool is that after finishing the game, you can play a New Game Plus, in which you need to replay the whole journey, but keeping your team and their hats. Yes, hats - although it is something purely cosmetic, the combination of some of them even guarantee you some achievements.\n\nSteamWorld Heist is excellently replayable because it brings procedural generation for the vast majority of missions, which means that some of them never repeat themselves. The only exceptions are key missions, such as boss fights and others that require a very specific objective. After a few hours of gameplay, a very interesting alarm system appears and it is similar to the alarm system of Invisible Inc, in which after a determined number of turns, more enemies or turrets appear, requiring time optimization.\n\nPerformance in the missions are rated positively if you complete it with all the crew alive and also find and pick up a hidden treasure. The performance is rewarded with stars, which are used to unlock new missions and also to recruit some soldiers. When you fail a mission, with all members dead, you lose half the water (which is the game's currency) that you have. Although it seems like something that punishes the player, this is actually a very friendly system, considering that we would have to lose many matches before achieve a game over.\n\nSteamWorld Heist also has some DLCs, which are basically new hats, a new playable character, new missions and new weapons and equipment. This extra content will not make much difference in the game, since it is already quite fun with the basic version, but it can serve as an incentive to finish the campaign and start New Game Plus with these additional content.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n* Gameplay that unites the best of XCOM and Worms\n* Good replay value and variety of missions\n* Great variety of items and weapons, even without the DLCs\n* Plot full of twists\n* Excellent soundtrack\n\n[b]Con[/b]\n* The first third of the game is repetitive and with some unnecessarily unfair enemies", "timestamp_created": 1487003778, "timestamp_updated": 1502666153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617563", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29898960": {"recommendationid": "29898960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108231915", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487065148}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u56de\u5408\u5236\u6218\u65d7\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6765\u81eaHB 2\u6708\u5305\u7684\u7cbe\u54c1\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\n\u96be\u6613\u5ea6\u968f\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5173\u5361\u7684\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u6b66\u5668\u88c5\u5907\u4e0d\u7b97\u5f88\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u7269\u7684\u6b66\u5668\u5012\u4e5f\u5404\u6709\u7279\u8272\n\u72d9\u51fb\u624b\uff0c\u69b4\u5f39\u624b\uff0c\u51b2\u950b\u67aa\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6b66\u5668\u4e5f\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5173\u5361\u7684\u5408\u7406\u5229\u7528\u662f\u65e0\u4f24\u901a\u5173\u7684\u5173\u952e\n\u97f3\u4e50\u5f88\u8d34\u5408\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6765\u6765\u53bb\u53bb\u5c31\u90a3\u51e0\u9996\u4f46\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4f1a\u611f\u5230\u591a\u4e48\u5355\u8c03\u3002\n\u6ca1\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u5267\u60c5\u4e5f\u4e0d\u662f\u591a\u4e48\u6df1\u9083\u96be\u61c2\uff0c\u5c31\u5f53\u4e00\u4e2a\u6218\u68cb\u6e38\u620f\u6e38\u73a9\u5c31\u597d\u5566\u3002\n\u6309\u7167\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u8fdb\u5ea6\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e94\u5f53\u4e0d\u957f\u3002\u901a\u5173\u540e\u518d\u6765\u5b8c\u5584\u8bc4\u6d4b\n\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d88\u78e8\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\u5b83\u7269\u8d85\u6240\u503c\u3002\n\u63a8\u8350\u624b\u67c4\u6e38\u620f\u54df\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1486990937, "timestamp_updated": 1486990937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.651390", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29892235": {"recommendationid": "29892235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006796071", "num_games_owned": 1417, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488080842}, "language": "english", "review": "I received this game as part of the Humble Monthly Bundle and couldn't be more happy!

It's a simple game of \"point-and-shoot\", not too complicated and doesn't come with all the Pay To Win baggage that other games have. It's like XCOM but simpler. Steamworld Heist is set in the world after Earth is destoyed and all its inhabitants are lost to space. You play Captain Piper, the leader of a ragtag Steam crew who has turned pirate due to her disobeying an order to sell Steambots into slavery. The \"Would you have sold the Jews to the Nazis if you were given the order?\" choice\n\nThe objective of Steamworld Heist is usually to kill all the enemy Scrappers, loot the Epic Scrap and have no casualties. To do so, you play a turn-based game. On your turn, you have 2 actions, Move and Shoot. You may move twice in a row and not shoot, move and shoot or shoot and not move. Hide behind conveniently placed barrels in all the enemy ships you encounter. Shoot dynamite that is also conveniently placed next to enemies. Combat is repetitive and the map doesn't change much. You can recruit, upgrade and outfit your crew to customise them to your play style which is pretty cool.\n\nConclusion, it is a fun game overall. While it is not XCOM, Steamworld Heist does give a feeling of a clean simple game. Note that it's co-founded by the European Union.\n\n[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]\n1. Simple Controls\nYou can just use the mouse to move and shoot. It's that simple.\n\n2. Build Your Crew\nYou can customise them to your playstyle.\n\n3. Different abilities\nAs you play the game, you can keep on levelling up and gain new abilitiies. While there isn't a talent tree to choose from, the special abilities do make a slight difference E.g. Ivanski's Abs of Steel, invulnerable for 1 turn.\n\n[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]\n1. Repetitive Combat\nIt's the exact same thing over and over again. \n\n2. Stupid Voiceovers\nElectronic metal grinding is kind of boring to listen to. While the dialogue is interesting, the voices are boring.\n\n3. Cheesing the Game\nMelee AI is the weakest in the whole game. They can be cheesed by covering all possible locations that they can stand on. E.g. Standing in between 2 barrels. That way the melee AI will attack the barrels and you'll still be able to shoot them at point blank range.\n\n4. The Characters don't differentiate until mid game\nYou can't see a difference until the bots level up, so your first impression is that there's no differentiation.\n\n5. Very Obvious Linear Questing\nNormally, games try to mask linear questing. This one doesn't. It's literally a line from point A to point B.\n\n6. New Game Plus\nIt was a bit dry honestly. I wasn't looking forward to the New Game Plus (the black hole). I would be fighting the exact same enemies and the story would be the same. I would have preferred something like the Witcher 2 which would entice me to play a NG+.", "timestamp_created": 1486565975, "timestamp_updated": 1487277439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29778626": {"recommendationid": "29778626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009106879", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486644446}, "language": "german", "review": "Nettes kleines Indiespiel f\u00fcr zwischen durch, was seinen eigenen Charm besitzt.", "timestamp_created": 1486549319, "timestamp_updated": 1486549319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29773195": {"recommendationid": "29773195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257106904", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486569570}, "language": "english", "review": "Got this game through Humble Bundle Monthly, and i got to admit it blew me away!

It is a light Tactical Role-Playing, bite-sized 2D Dungeon Crawler, with a \"trick shot\" Outer Space Western vibe that's set in an endearing Steampunk World inhabited by robots. Travel through space and through 3 distinctly different zones, assault enemy barges and slowly build an arsenal of weapons. Gather a likeable cast of mechanized misfits.\n\nThe game itself is PERFECTLY suited for occasional casual play, with challenging levels that take maybe 5-15 minutes a piece and it's a joy to pop in when you've a got a few spare minutes to waste.\n\nPerhaps the game's biggest trick is the way you fire, which is a mix of both carefully manual aiming - which can almost become a puzzle onto itself when handling snipers - combined with the XCOM method of movement and ability usage. There is no percentage, or luck based shooting. You yourself decide on the arch of your character's shots, raising their aim up and down, wether it is to lob a grenade just over a barrel, or carefully line up your bullet to ricochet off the surfaces. Your characters aims aren't steady and will waver along the general direction, but if you time your shot when it all lines up perfectly, you could in theory hit your marks halway across the map. It's all on you and when you manage to bounce your sniper's shot across 4 different surfaces to hit a distant enemy in the back of the head as he cowers behind a barrel, it is an extremely rewarding experience that ties well into the game's slightly Western / Firefly motive.\n\nPerfect execution and steady aim is all but required as well, since the game isn't all that forgiving on a wasted turn. There is a constant timer that, although not causing an instant game over, will summon additional reinforcements that will overwhelm a sluggish or conservative player if the biggest existing threats haven't already been dealt with.\n\nThe enemies are varied and cleverly designed, and will require careful planning. Shooting a hulking foe in the knee will immobilize them. Carrying specific items around might help open up new tactics, like stunning them. Shield carrying foes need to be either flanked or lured into an area where you can bounce your shot to hit them in a weak spot. The last zone's enemies force you to stay mobile, or prioritize targets. You have abilities such as healing, auras to buff allies, double shots, sprint & gun and many more to stay alive. \n\nThe RPG mechanics are minimal and you don't have to worry about skill trees. Each character has three inventory slots to give them new abilities, make up for weaknesses, or emphasize strengths as you see fit. None of it is very complicated, but fortunately the game does an excellent job of setting you up with a cast of characters that feel diverse and unique enough to be ultimately rewarding as you level up their pre-existing talents. Wacky, mute melee characters that can land and take a punch. A charming old military granny armed with a bazooka and enough explosives to blow a black hole in space. A sniping chimney sweep, a grizzled old shotgun sailor and a farmyard gal turned SMG wielding bounty hunter. My favourite must be \"payroll\": A gentleman fortune hunter that can blitz through enemy lines to flank, with abilities that are all puns on his method of mono-wheeled propulsion.\n\n\nAnd all of these character, and the world they live in, are just a treat to spend your time with. Although you won't spend a lot of time delving into lore, effective use of quips, jokes, background art, casual chatter among the robot crew and light-hearted remarks, all tell a much greater story in just a few effective sentences. The recovery of an old human steam iron for instance, sees the game speculate on how this must have been the first of steam robot kind, telling the player much about how little the robots really know about the past and where humanity went. The final enemies, are not only exactly what you'd expect an adversary of a steampunk world to be, but tie in beautifully to the Western/Firefly theme of individual freedom and frontier spirit.\n\nHighly recommended as both a charming adventure and a light-hearted strategy game.", "timestamp_created": 1486477306, "timestamp_updated": 1486477770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29760572": {"recommendationid": "29760572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011501578", "num_games_owned": 1084, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489188745}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would blow my team up again", "timestamp_created": 1486471084, "timestamp_updated": 1486471084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29759940": {"recommendationid": "29759940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034350405", "num_games_owned": 326, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486824153}, "language": "english", "review": "i give this game a finger up n good luck :>) godo game", "timestamp_created": 1486468435, "timestamp_updated": 1486468435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29756404": {"recommendationid": "29756404", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978393099", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 4385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490667253}, "language": "english", "review": "I am going to first have to give a shout out to Humble Bundle.

This game is much easier and has virtually no meta-game. Putting a tactical game into a side-view takes away actual dimensions of strategy. This strikes me as something that should be more of a child's intro to strategy games rather than an actual expansion of the genre.\n\n... but despite that, it is wildly refreshing to play a tactical game in which shooting at someone results in them actually being shot, and you know exactly when enemies are going to see you and vice versa, and no one's magically shooting you thru walls. It's actually made me think about whether the 'difficulty' I'm attributing to more 'serious' tactical games is legitimately earned or not.\n\nThe game is also very charming, and it takes the right approach to story-telling (punchy).

Robots! X-COM tactical gameplay! HATS!!!\n\nGreat game if you like tactical turn-based games.  For those of you that have played X-COM before, you'll be at home with this 2-D verrsion of the gameplay you're used to, only with less stress and more focus on riccochet shooting, and in some of the crew's case, buffing squadmates.  There's partial and full cover that you'll need to learn to take advantage of to survive, even if you don't call it that (old habit i suppose), squad positioning is key, weapons and armor can and need to be adjusted throughout your missions (each character gets one weapon (limited to two specific types per char) and 2 supplemental items (universal to all chars).\n\nThe great thing about this game that makes it different/less stressful than X-COM is the focus on making every shot count, but you don't have permanent reprecussions for your actions.  If all your squadmates die, they can be put back together for half your earnings and the loss of any XP gained on that mission for dead squadmates (rough, but easily recoverable).  I personally started on Veteran, the 2nd hardest diff, and it's something I'd only recommend if you're familiar with these kinds of games.

It was a pretty simple Motherlode-style platformer, but it had charm and a satisfying gameplay loop. The only problem was its length, which was short enough to beat in just a few sessions. The game was successful, but rather than do a direct sequel, Image & Form decided to make one in a different genre altogether, a strategy RPG. That means you won't beat Steamworld Heist in just a few hours, and it also resulted in a fantastic game to me.\n\nHeist is set a while after Dig, following the Earth exploding and its robot inhabitants moving into space on barges. You play as Captain Piper and her crew, who operate as space 'pirates', although you never steal from anyone who isn't also a pirate or evil in some other way, so they may as well just be bounty hunters or something. Pirate attacks in the outer regions of space have become more vicious later, and it's up to them to find out why, and make off with as much loot or hats as they can carry.\n\nCombat is clearly inspired by X-COM: all the ladders, drops and cover are there as you might have seen them in Enemy Unknown/Within, but set in a 2D backdrop. Also like that game, you can move and shoot or use an item, or use your entire move dashing. The most unique wrinkle though, is that there is no RNG in Steamworld Heist, at least on your end. When you go to attack at range, you're allowed to freely aim your weapon, and spend as long as you want aiming the perfect shot. Your bots' don't have perfect stability, so the sights waver a bit, and there are things like ricochets to factor in, but if you hate when a 90 percent shot turns into a miss in X-COM or Fire Emblem, this might be the game for you.\n\nThat doesn't make the game easy, of course. Even your most bulky party members can't just tank fire, and it's safe to assume enemies will hit them if they're ever out in the open. Your team is made up of all unique party members, so they're not gone forever if they bite it, but that means they don't receive experience (which is doled out for fulfilling mission objectives rather than killing enemies), and your rating for the mission will drop. It's a good balance between encouraging you to be careful, but not punishing you horribly if something happens to go wrong. There are also multiple difficulties so you can fine-tune it however you like.\n\nDespite being in just 2D Heist has a lot of tricks up its sleeve, such as enemies who only melee, ones with shields you have to flank, and ones who charge up piercing lasers. It's also able to replicate things from X-COM that work with it, like flanking (at least with two characters), and a running timer on some missions that will spawn extra reinforcements, keeping you from just turtling up. There are also some interesting boss battles, which X-COM doesn't really do.\n\nHeist also has a DLC known as The Outsider, which adds another character and a couple more missions to each map (of which there are three, with different ships to invade and enemies to fight). It's not necessary by any means, but the extra crew member is interesting to use, and it has some useful, but not game-breaking items. I like that it's not cordoned off in its own little area, and it's only five dollars as well.\n\nOverall, Steamworld Heist was a very pleasant surprise for me, and a huge step forward for the people behind it. Moving between genres can't be easy, but they produced something not just good, but a huge leap forward compared to their last game. If any of this sounds interesting to you I'd recommend picking it up now, and especially if it's on sale.

Although the game is in side-scrolling 2D, it encompasses the familiar genre staples such as a cover system and terrain variability while displaying some of its own mechanics such as bullet ricochet which add some depth to the simplified systems. While the game delivers an entertaining journey and tense combat, it suffers from a lacklustre story and somewhat repetitive mission structure in the latter half.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+ Dialogue and interactions between characters is really enjoyable as characters often share their entertaining back-stories with you after missions.\n+ Combat is extremely well done, I've heard it compared to a simplified mix of XCOM/Worms.\n+ Bullet ricochet is highly enjoyable as you can kill enemies hiding behind cover by ricocheting bullets in the blind spots where there is no cover. Getting unassisted ricocheted kills feel extremely  satisfying.\n+ A lot of effort was placed into the audio and visual aspects of the game and it shows as the game oozes polish from every nook and cranny.\n+ There's no grind for what amounts for a tactical game and that's surprising for me. Lower skilled characters can be carried and get essential 2 bars if they survived the mission easily bringing them up to the rest of the squad.\n+ There's no reliance on RNG during the combat it's all skill. If you missed shot, YOU missed the shot as have full control of where you aim. If a character is out in the open then the chances of receiving damage is 90-100% and it was fully based on YOUR decision.\n+ Combat while not difficult is often times tense under certain situations depending on your difficulty.\n+ The difficulty curve is rather smooth. I played on Experienced and even though I got wiped on a few missions, it wasn't difficult to complete the game.\n+ A unique-ish loot system that's literally all of the items found lying on the floor in missions plus the epic swag bonus which is often placed in a mildly inconvenient room forcing you to explore all rooms. Don't feel like managing your small inventory to store mission loot rewards, fine, simply go for the epic swag and leave all other items alone.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Story is kind of lacklustre and forgettable.\n- You can't equip weapons/items outside of missions.\n- Missions are too repetitive, you're often stuck doing the same things mission in, mission out and while enjoyable it does get tiresome.\n- Limited inventory results in management feeling extremely tedious as you're given generous amounts of loot as reward for completing missions.\n- Aborting missions cost 50% of your current money/water. Why is this a thing, there were times where I accidentally retried missions I'd completed instead of selecting the next mission and I had to slug through it again because I'd be penalised for nothing.\n- The game feels a bit too long and drawn out, almost like if it was padded with unnecessary content e.g. the 1 character missions.\n- There are times where the enemy AI is too accurate. This is clearly evident during the boss battle against the Queen. The general's bullet will ricochet a number of times and the result is a perfect shot no matter what. I've had this happen to me a lot during that battle to the point that it's unfair and too perfect.\n- Battles can become drawn out as result of the alert system which spawns a number of enemies of increasing difficulty when the counter has elapsed. I get why this is here but boy does it get annoying.\n\n[h1]Irritations[/h1]\n+/- Hats...why are they a thing? They serve literally no purpose, no added stat benefit or complexity. \n+/- Loot is kind of boring as it simply boils down to +1 this or -1 that.\n+/- There are no unique group passive synergies when in combat other than the captain's Inspire ability. I feel like this is a missed opportunity seeing as how simplified the game is, this could've added some much needed depth and nuance to the combat.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nSteamWorld Heist is an overall enjoyable experience despite its shortcomings and is well worth the recommendation. The combat is tense, the dialogue is well written, the strategy and tactical mechanics while simple are extremely accessible and all of this results in a very entertaining package.", "timestamp_created": 1483912480, "timestamp_updated": 1507161175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29109986": {"recommendationid": "29109986", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994599805", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484994783}, "language": "english", "review": "There are hats :D\n\nReally awesome game love the steamworld aesthetics.

There is a good selection of members and guns to choose from that cater to different playing styles. Some are sharpshooters that get an aim-assist laser line, some are rocket launcher users, some are more skilled based (i.e. Sally can get additional shots if she kills an enemy and with 'mad dog' she can shoot forever until she doesn't kill an enemy in one turn) and others are more strategy based (i.e. Payroll has very high movement and gains double shot + bonus dmg when flanking so you move behind enemies and unleash hell on them).\n\nThe levels are mostly randomized to some degree and sometimes, but if you played certain levels 10+ times over (yea I did lol) you've gotten the idea what the general layout is going to be like.\n\nThe majority of the RNG comes from whether or not you crit an enemy, assuming you don't have 100% crit chance and sometimes when you do not crit and the enemy survives with 1 hp it kinda sucks.\n\nThere are weapon shops in-game but some of the best equipment I've obtained was RNG loot from finishing levels. Though not necessary to continue with the game it does make it much easier (i.e. Exoskeleton - +2 HP, +1 Mend +1 Melee..that is really nice for melee focused member like Billy).\n\nThe music and art-style is appropriate and both are enjoyable.\n\nGame also offers NG+ if you want to start from the beginning, but keep your crew, level and gear. This gives the oppurtunity to play at a higher difficulty level..or lower if you wish.\n\nThe story was simple, and straightforward. Nothing spectacular about it, but really bad about it either.\n\n------------\ntl;dr \nGameplay - 2/2\nBoss Fights - 1/1\nCustomization of Party - 2/2\nArt and Music - 2/2\nNG+ - 1/1\nStory 1/2\n\nOverall: 9/10.

The maps are not-top, but veiwed from the side, almost like a side-scroller. But don't be fooled - you will still be playing the game by selecting units, exacuting commands and taking turns with your enemy. The only difference in controls is the aforementioned manual aiming. When you want to attack, you'll have to point your sights just right. This adds a lot to the strategy. Cover is not just a stat, but a physical barrier that cannot be shot through. Accuracy is also not a stat - all skill. This also allows for fun trick shots, something that you could never do just hitting the \"attack\" command. It opens up all new possibilites for clever manuvers outside of the simple numbers and rulebooks. The numbers still play a big part of the game though, so strategy fans, don't worry. Manual aiming is a big part of the game, but doesn't take over the other aspects of the game in any way. There's experience and leveling, tons of weapons and subweapons, shops and item management, and so forth. It all fits together very nicely and becomes a seemless strategy-sprinkled-with-skill experience.\nTo top it off, the world is a quirky steampunk space land with lovable automaton characters and fun hats to collect. The story isn't much, just enough to give you an excuse to go from shoot-out to shoot-out, and the characters and world add a charm on top of the fun gameplay that completes the uniqueness of the experience.\nAlso, the soundtrack is done by Steam Powered Giraffe, a steampunk-themed folk/vaudeville band that sings about automatons even when they're not writing for a steampunk game. They did an excellent job on this soundtrack, so if you like the soundtrack in this game, check out their other work as well.\nOverall, this game is like no others out there.

The New Game Plus option also allows you to start over keeping your... Well, I won't spoil too much, but it makes restarting feel even [i]more[/i] fun. It's nice to go back to the basics after beating the entire game, especially since about halfway through, you'll forget what it feels like to not be overwhelmed at all times.\n\n[b]PROS:[/b]\n\nLots of things.\n[*] Turn based, but not: Although you and the enemy take turns shooting at each other in a very engaging bar-fight-shoot-out-esque style, you don't simply click on the enemy to attack. Well, I mean, you can. But what I mean is, you do the aiming. Some guns ricochet, some guns deal area damage, some guns pierce. This combined with the fact you have to manually line up your sights with the enemy makes it feel much more immersive.\n[*] A wide cast of characters: Some people will tell you that some characters become useless at some point, and some are too over-powered. I partly agree. Some characters are practically essential to have late-game, and it becomes pretty obvious that not just ANY team comp will work. However... That said, the characters all have personalities, which are great. Sometimes, after a mission, you can talk to them back on-board and learn something about their past, or their character. Additionally, bringing certain heroes to certain missions prompts dialogue that you otherwise never would have heard. It's up to you to figure that out. Oh and, when I said I partly agreed, I said it because I don't really think any hero becomes [i]totally[/i] useless. Some characters become more viable, but this doesn't neccessarily mean the rest of the crew becomes useless. If you want a challenge, or are just genuinely attached to a character, by all means, use them!\n[*] THE GRAPHICS: My gosh, the scenery, the characters, the background... It's all beautiful. I've never seen another game company make something in this exact way - Not to say it's the best thing ever, but it's absolutely gorgeous most of the time, and feels refreshing. Even the dark, gloomy interiors of the Scrapper ships (Don't worry, it's not really a spoiler. They're literally the first enemies you'll encounter.) will take your eye off the battle once or twice... or twenty times... In one level. Not to mention the detail they put into the cosmos, which is always present in the background, and most of the time covered by the level you're on. Take time to look around, you'll find it worth your time. Mainly because of the aesthetics... And there's some nice little easter eggs and quirky things to see!\n[*] The story: This game made me think it was going to be really short. And then there was a non-specific thing that non-specifically happened that changed the story to a non-specific degree. I'm trying not to spoiler much. This also happens a non-specific amount of times. In a non-specific order. Needless to say, the story will keep you glued to the game for your first run-through, and likely for the next couple of times as you find more and more you missed the first couple of times.\n[*] The sounds: This may sound minor, but believe me it's not. When I say sounds, I mean ALL of them. Of course the music is great, if you've played Steamworld Dig you'd know that. If not, I'm telling you - The music is great. But it's also the little things, like the enemy bots falling apart and their parts clanking on the ground a few times before finally settling, the richochet of bullets off metal, heck, even the robots [b]talking[/b] sounds awesome! Trust me, you'll know what I mean when you try it.\n[*] The feeling of growth of your team: This is sort of a weird one, but if you're one of those people who [i]loves[/i] watching your roster slowly grow in power and ability over the course of a game, this game really makes you feel good about it. The benefits of leveling up range from a minor health boost or passive, to a huge turn that makes the character totally different from everyone else. Exp grinding is also NOT A PAIN AT ALL. Seriously. To get all characters to max level, you might have to run a couple levels a couple more times than usual. But it's fun to do that! And you can totally beat the game without maxed out heroes, so don't even worry about it unless you really, really want it (Like I did). Oh, and there's an achievement for it. So yeah.\n[*] HATS! HATS HATS HATS! This game has hats! Lots of them! In fact it's almost a joke! Shoot hats off of your enemies to get them! Buy hats! JUST GET MORE HATS! Haaaats!\n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n\n(Wind howls, and a tumbleweed made of scrap and barbed wire flies across outer-space...)\n\nWell not entirely. Although there are a couple things that nag me, and might nag you. For starters...\n\n[*] This isn't the case for me, but I can see how it can be for others - Repetativeness: This isn't the case for me, but I can see how it can be for others - Repetativeness... In all seriousness, there's enough character diversity and most but not all levels are randomly generated, so this shouldn't be too big an issue... And like I said, there's not much grinding involved, so a new level will probably feel... Well, like a new level! But I can certainly see how it can get a liiiittle boring for soooooome people. But trust me - Odds, are, it won't be a problem. At all. Take a break from the game now and then, and the urge to come back will slowly creep up on you.\n[*] Weapon diversity: For the most part, and I won't lie, new weapons are usually just upgraded versions of the ones you already had. Which is fine, except... There's not many weapons that AREN'T straight upgrades to ones you already had. Sure, different heroes use different types of weapons, but outside of that, each type of weapon usually only does 1 or 2 different things, at most, depending on the type. Oh, and there's some nice quirky \"rare\" weapons that change it up, but like I said, you'll probably find a powered-up version that will eventually turn it into nothing more than a collector's item... Which leads me to my last \"con\".\n[*] Inventory space: There ain't much of it. You're gonna have to spend a LOT of water (in-game currency, go figure) to upgrade your inventory size, too. It's a pain, sort of. Grind a few levels and you'll be filthy rich again, though. I guess the whole \"new weapons are just upgrades from the previous ones\" works with this system, since you're probably gonna want to sell the old weapons anyways... It's just... I wish there was more. You have to check your inventory and sell stuff every couple of missions. And I'd like to keep those rare collectible weapons just for fun without compromising my time sifting my inventory of junk and duplicates. But this is a minor issue, if an issue at all.\n\nAnd... That's all! I gotta say, this game blew me away. I knew Steamworld Dig was fun, but it's not like it was ground breaking (Tecnhically speaking, it was, but you know what I mean). If I'm being totally honest, I wasn't sure how well they were gonna pull this game off. I was a skeptic. But as a skeptic does, I completely took back my word once I saw the evidence (Disclaimer: Some skeptics are still too stubborn to do this). By that note, if you're skeptical about this game too, I understand. People tend to read a bit more into the Cons of a game review than the Pros, and take the Cons much more to heart. But please, for your sake, don't. Don't second-guess yourself on this one. If you like any of the genres, or liked Steamworld Dig, or anything Steampunk/Robot related, or shoot-outs, or space, or just great game design in general, do yourself a favor and buy this game. Wanna wait til its on sale? Why not? Only means you're getting a game worth well more than its price tag for cheap.

Common weapons of the same tier generally deal the same damage, and this is an issue. Pistols have perfect aim while SMGs and shotguns do not. When all three deal identical damage on a direct hit, the pistol is clearly the superior choice in almost all situations, with the shotgun being the least useful. Only sniper weapons and heavy weapons are exceptions to this, due to the usefulnes of laser sights with the former and area damage of the latter.\n\n2) New Game Plus. This is literally just a reset of the entire game, except you get to keep your crew members.

Why wasn't it in my library sooner?\"\n\nThat's all I got for an introduction, so let's just dive in.\n\n[b]PROS[/b]\n[list]\n[*]The core mechanic of the game is the player-controlled aiming; it gets the player far more involved in combat than simply picking a target and rolling the dice like other TBT games.  Even with infinite turn time, the slightest sway can take you off target and you'll have only your own timing and placement to blame.  Shot ricochet is also central to the game; No shot is sweeter than the one that removes the rare hat from your opponent before bouncing off the wall and planting itself in the back of the bot's head\n[*]The roster of squadmates is diverse, with some having varying skills inside the same class, and some having a class all their own.\n[*]Weapons, especially legendaries, become very eccentric after a third of the way through the game: Laser-sighted sharpshooter pistols that shoot through enemies, cluster-firing rocket launchers and a gun that throws a heap of bouncing spike-balls at your foes.\n[*]Do I even have to say that SPG brings their best to this game?\n[/list]\n\n[b]CONS[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Some squadmates will become obsolete, even after much grinding to keep them up with the rest of the squad.  Sally is an early addition to your crew, but her skills are a poor match for her stats; her skills are focused on killing as many opponents in one turn as possible, but while others would have extra health or greater mobility to back this up, she has neither.  Meanwhile, Ivanski the tank would soak up XP from how much I used him.\n[*]Be sure to keep up with your weapon's rank, because difficulty takes a SPIKE during the last third of the game, due to the new super-durable units deployed in disproportionate numbers.  On medium or higher, I was very unlikely to get through a mission with all bots intact on the first try.", "timestamp_created": 1478400967, "timestamp_updated": 1478400967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26435758": {"recommendationid": "26435758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059517094", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479012483}, "language": "english", "review": "I expected a short fun romp through this game.

En cualquier caso, es algo que puedes cambiar en cada misi\u00f3n. \n\nEn cuanto a la duraci\u00f3n, llevo 21 horas en mi primera partida y no me debe quedar mucho (he de decir que he repetido bastantes misiones para conseguir agua (la moneda de este juego) y experiencia).\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, es un juego que me ha enamorado, ALTAMENTE RECOMENDABLE.\n\nUn saludo :).", "timestamp_created": 1477224614, "timestamp_updated": 1479995549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26128974": {"recommendationid": "26128974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090474986", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508530953}, "language": "english", "review": "So, after over 20 hours of gameplay I finished the game on the third out of five difficulty levels - Experienced.\n\nAnd wow, was it a fun ride.\n\nI guess it's time to write a review, huh?\n\nThen let's start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteamworld Heist is set in a universe where humans went extinct (not quite, but... spoilers) and Earth is now inhabited by steam powered robots. Actually it WAS inhabited by them, because Steamworld Heist takes place hundreds of years after the first game, when Earth explodes and all that is left of it are big shards floating in space. Luckily Steambots learned how to build spaceships and managed to escape.\n\nSoon began the new era in their history, a era of Cowbots exploring the endless frontiers of Universe.\n\nBut their life isn't so simple. Cowbots have to face many powerful threats: space pirates, diesel powered robots who formed strong military and consider themselves superior over everyone else, and an alien, powerful threat lurking somewhere in Deep Space.\n\n\nIn Steamworld Heist you play as Piper Faraday - a pirate captain with a golden heart and assemble a crew of different colorful characters, like a jolly adventurous grampa who is a great sniper, a soldier with a love for blowing things up or a robot sailor with a fish head who can only communicate by saying \"Blub\".\n\n\nThe gameplay is a bit like 2D XCOM - you play in turns, there's full cover and half cover, you also can choose if you want to move a few tiles and shoot, or use up your turn to sprint. But there's a very important feature that makes Steamworld Heist much better than XCOM.\n\n\n\nYou aim each shot manually. When you play your shots are not calculated by RNG - everything depends on your skill. Another cool thing is that your bullets can bounce off walls and objects. You will use ricochets often, because enemies rarely can be hit with a straight shot. If someone hides behind cover, you can just shoot at a nearby wall or barrel to hit him in the back of the skull. When you pull off a risky shot and it connects, it feels really satisfying.\n\nThe game has a wide selection of different weapons you can use as well as many different items you can equip for missions, like medkits, armor or sidearms. But that's not important.\n\n\nWhat's important that this game has hats.\n\n\nDozens of hats.\n\n\nWhat are they for?\n\n\nNothing. Absolutely f*cking nothing. They don't give you any stat boosts, they are just there to put on your head.\n\nSo does that mean that they suck?\n\nNo! They look great and it's fun to collect different hats and put them on different characters.\n\n\nAlso, a really good band called Steam Powered Giraffe made several songs for this game.\n\nCheck them out on Youtube, they are fantastic.\n\n\n\nSo, in short: \n\n\nSteamworld Heist is almost perfect. It runs well, the graphics look good, the gameplay is really fun, it offers a lot of replayability, and the music is super catchy. This may be the best game I ever played in the last few years.\n\n\nHighly recommend.\n\n\n\nAlso, get the Outsider DLC. You will get a awesome new character, more missions, new weapons and even more hats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlub.", "timestamp_created": 1476969173, "timestamp_updated": 1478939956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622931", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26065752": {"recommendationid": "26065752", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111201386", "num_games_owned": 1107, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485487959}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u771f\u662f\u592a cool\u4e86\uff0c\u8ba9\u6211\u518d\u591a\u73a9\u51e0\u5c0f\u65f6\n\u563f\u5b59\u5b50\uff0c\u8fd8\u6211\u5e3d\u5b50", "timestamp_created": 1476610141, "timestamp_updated": 1477197089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26055879": {"recommendationid": "26055879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027447538", "num_games_owned": 484, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477858491}, "language": "english", "review": "Great addictive game.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1476562947, "timestamp_updated": 1476562947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.356652", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26007729": {"recommendationid": "26007729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198236816864", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476329410}, "language": "english", "review": "Broad Review: This is a turn-based strategy game where the player must use their robots to reach an objective. There are several different classes that are used and introduced in the game each with something unique and useful to bring. Similar to Worms, each person can attack once per turn, but unlike Worms the turns are for the whole team rather than just one person on the team.\n\ntl;won't read : This game is a fun little time waster if you can get past the bullcrap but it the game doesn't even try to do anything new and it will have a hard time keeping you engaged. If there was more effort put into the gameplay or story than I would be much more amused.\n\nNumbering:\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] 4/10\n[b]Story:[/b] 2/10\n[b]Music:[/b] 6/10\n[b]Visuals[/b] 7/10\n\n[b]Overall[/b] 6/10\nFor a more extensive review, please see below:\n\n[b]Gameplay: 4/10[/b] This game plays well and runs well even on my weak laptop, however, the gameplay lacks depth and will become boring as the story is not intersting in the slightest. Also, there are plenty of game design choices that are either bad or ones that I did not agree with. These problems include:[b]Difficulty Spiking[/b] The difficulty curve is a bit wonky even in the short time that I played it, act 1 was very easy but 2 missions into act two is where the ai gets extreme aiming ability as well as abilities that you won't even know existed that allows them to do things that you aren't even sure you'll ever be able to do...  in short the gameplay becomes unfair instead of difficult because of it.[b]Infinetly Spawning Enimies[/b] Honestly, I thought videogames were over this. Never have I played a game with infinitely spawning enemies and thought it was amazing. Even worse, enemies that spawn in the middle of a match have a turn although, luckily, they don't always take advantage of it. This is a legit bad design choice as it shows just how much your game lacks depth and it is just artificial difficulty.[b]Randomly Generated Missions[/b]  This is another design choice that confused me because it removes several elements of strategy from the game. It's obvious this was added in to prevent the player from getting an edge but it is not fun for a single player game. Especially considering that there is no way the player can know which characters to bring anyway meaning you will have to play missions several times before finding out what works.\nThere are some good design choices, very few but very fun. The gunplay is interesting and the ability, while mostly useless, are fun to mess around with. Other than that there isn't much to say.\n\n[b]Story 2/10[/b] Here's a story that you've never heard before, evil underdogs rebel againts a society that is being ruined by a superior foe. A very unique concept that has only been done in almost every form of media and each genre in that respective media. Like the gameplay, the story doesn't bring anything new to the table but it does little to offend and that's why It scores very low. If it was bad then there could have been some enjoyment out of it, but it lacks depth and it does nothing with the concept. The characters do not help, there is absolutely nothing interesting about the charcters beyond the first few missions, this is true in most games but this time it was particularly dreadful because there is so much that could be done with the characters in the world yet the chance is missed completely. The writing has it's moments but they are very few and hard to find because you will skip it... because it's boring. In short, interesting premise that is brought down by boring characters and an equally boring plot. \n\n[b]Music: 5/10[/b] The music during the gameplay was bad, not to say it was horrible but it wasn't passible. The tracks aren't very inspired and feels as if it was made quickly and haphazardly. It also loses it's effect as it is played all of the time and there is no intensity with harder/more enimies which feels like a huge wasted oppurtunity. [b]HOWEVER[/b] there is good music in the rest of the world, namely the bar. Music helps make a game more immersive and the bar helped build the world. Unfortunatley, it was great at best and overall, the music is brought down due to the lame gameplay music.\n\n[b]Visuals: 7/10[/b] This game's art is not bad. In fact, it is simple enough to remain memorable and unique enough to have it's own identity. Everything that needs to be there in terms of gameplay elements is easily distinguishable making it easy to look at and play. It is only a seven though becuase while it is very good, it isn't new nor interesting. I honestly would have glazed over this game had it not been recommened to me because this style, steampunk, is not my thing. I do know other people enjoy steam punk and you wouldn't be looking at this review for this game if you weren't interested.\n\nMy overall opinion: This game is very well polished and has had a clear amount of effort put it and some aspects its play. However, unlike most strategy games, this game lacks depth and very quickly becomes unintersting. There isn't anything new in this game in the first place and if you have ever played any 2-D strategy game and didn't enjoy it, you will Definetly NOT enjoy this.\n    It may be obvious by now but I did NOT enjoy playing this game. So why did I reccommend it? Because if you can get past the lack of depth and boring story than you have a fun little time waster on your hands and I mean that with a lot of sincerity. If you play this game casually, rather than a hardcore game, then you will enjoy it.", "timestamp_created": 1476332821, "timestamp_updated": 1476332821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588015", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25991384": {"recommendationid": "25991384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108310602", "num_games_owned": 352, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509407320}, "language": "english", "review": "Very addictive game.\n\nCast of colorful characters, interesting-yet-simple gameplay, gorgeous handdrawn graphics, soundtrack by Steam Powered Giraffe, etc.\n\nI do strongly recommend that game.

There weren't enough things introduced in the late game that kept the gameplay fresh.  As a result, the game became stale \n* New Game + is literally just playing the game over again, except you get to keep your hats and unlocked characters.  I only played the first stage of NG+ before quitting. \n* I didn't see much of a reason to switch characters (on Experienced difficulty).  Party priority was Sally, Piper, Bea, and Billy, and I didn't feel like I needed to switch it up from that.  \n\nNotes:\n* If you would like to get credit for beating the game on a higher difficulty, make sure to stay at that difficulty! I played most of the game on the Experienced difficulty, which is like the 2nd to hardest, but I only got credit for the lowest difficulty that I played it on, which was normal for the first level because I didn't know how hard it was going to be.  So I feel a bit ripped off there.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nIt was a fun game, and I would recommend it to others, but I probably won't be coming back to it.

Lots of potential wasted here, IMO.[/b] Not to sound insulting, but Image & Form games often feel (to me) like one notch above games with mobile developement in mind. Overly simplified to a fault. When you build a game that begs to be compared and described as something like [i]XCOM[/i], you have the potential for tons of customization and sandbox-like creativity. Let me explain further.\n\nWhen you reduce a tactical game down to 2D, you already lose a bit of strategy, which is fine - to a certain extent this was made up for by the brilliant bullet-bouncing/aiming system. Thats great, and beyond the superb graphics and music, thats about where the greatness ends. [b]Leveling up could not be more simple - you have no choices, no skill tree, and have no options in bonuses you recieve.[/b] It might as well be non-existant. You gain power as you win, and therefore can fight stronger/more enemies. It's a rub.\n\nAt first the loot you find is interesting until you realize that guns aren't [i]really[/i] that functionally different, and it's a simple numbers game (ie. Gun A has +1, and Gun B has +2, so Gun B it is). [b]The weapon stats increase fairly linearly, so you don't get that awesome feeling of finding rare loot, or getting something early in the game.[/b] Another note about loot - at the end of every level you have to 'open' your loot by clicking on it, which is fun for a second, but after a couple hours it feels like a mobile game. Yawn.\n\nThe hat collection is cool, and I like how you can strategize to shoot them off of enemies heads to get them. Nice. Are they functional? I don't believe they are, but I could be wrong. \n\n[b]I find it frustrating to give [i]SteamWorld Heist[/i] a negative review, because it is really awesome and is [i]soooo close[/i] to achieving greatness.[/b] But alas, it is also so far. I want more. I want strategy like [i]XCOM[/i]. Whether it would be more base-building elements, better equipment, character customization, etc. All of this is possible in this game. In fact, the hard part of building a brilliant combat system is done. I think we just need more bells-and-whistles.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Awesome addicting combat that rewards solid strategy a la [i]XCOM[/i]\n+Beautiful artwork, animation, and music\n+Gotta love that [i]SteamWorld[/i] universe\n+Controls are tight regardless if you use keyboard and mouse or controller\n+Hat collection is cool\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-Everything can be solved with money, and this is no exception; if the game were ten bucks, I could overlook a lot, but that's not the state of things, so:\n-Overall things are too simple for an [i]XCOM[/i]-like game; loot is boring and linear, character customization verges on something mobile (as does a few features), no base building elements, etc.\n\n[b]At the end of the day, considering all the DLC, [i]SteamWorld Heist[/i] costs well over $20, which is quite steep for something so one-dimensional.[/b] Yes, the combat and artwork and music and atmosphere are brilliant, but after about 2-5 hours I think most people would find it repetitive and shallow.\n\nPeace,", "timestamp_created": 1475761676, "timestamp_updated": 1475761768, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 184, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.740694", "comment_count": "16", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25876150": {"recommendationid": "25876150", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117876807", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467888445}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0438\u0448 \u043d\u0430 12 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0439", "timestamp_created": 1475704962, "timestamp_updated": 1475704962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.405934", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25861980": {"recommendationid": "25861980", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010502697", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486162957}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0441\u0435\u043b \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 10 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442, \u0432\u044b\u043b\u0435\u0437 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 8 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432... \u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044d\u0444\u0444\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0449\u0443\u0449\u0430\u043b... \u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043e!", "timestamp_created": 1475627130, "timestamp_updated": 1475627130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25861585": {"recommendationid": "25861585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009187472", "num_games_owned": 588, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477602048}, "language": "swedish", "review": "Ja de e redigt brao!", "timestamp_created": 1475624434, "timestamp_updated": 1475624434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25855614": {"recommendationid": "25855614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057193694", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475481137}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good.

It wasn't a game I'd play for multiple playthroughs, but it was nice. So, for my stream, I requested a key for SteamWorld Heist through my press contact. I was expecting a demo. They gave me the full game plus DLC.\n\nBut when I say that \"if I could buy this game again for myself,  I would\", I mean it. Because this game is 100% more up my alley.\n\nTaking place in the same universe as SteamWorld Dig, Heist plays as a turn-based tactical shooter. There are nine characters (ten with Outsider DLC) that each bring their own unique flavor, allowing a variety of playstyles and approaches to any particular mission. Crippling mechanics and flankers give an advantage from below or behind, but explosives characters might prefer the high ground. Ricochet mechanics allow sharpshooters and snipers (and others, if you're really good at free aiming) plenty of opportunities for complex shots from safe positions. Brawlers and other heavy characters can get in the enemies' faces. And even within the same character class, your crew still has differences in weapon proficiencies and specific advantages between them. Ultimately, combined with simple but punishing level design, this creates a tactics experience that can be both meditative and relaxing on easier difficulties or missions and a genuine challenge and rage-inducing trial on harder difficulties. Equipment allows additional customization, but you have to be choosy with it; limited inventory (while a good mechanic for a challenge) is still one of the most frustrating mechanics in games of any genre. But don't worry! The cosmetic hats you can collect by lightly skimming them off the heads of your enemies take up none of your inventory! So collect away!\n\nThe story is presented in a playful western-in-space asthetic with plenty of banter and dialogue to give more substance. I wouldn't say the game is plot heavy, but it doesn't promise to me. What it does promise is the swagger and quirky humor of its thematic genre. The music contains one of the game's strongest points and weakest. In chapter completes and bars, the music is provided by Steam Powered Giraffe, a steampunk band that fits this game's flavor like a glove.

Everything is done almost perfectly, and i'd like to express how much i've come to love this game here.\n\nThe mechanics are extremely satisfying. It's a turn-based system on a 2D plane where you have to maneuver and aim shots, using various mechanics to insure that you're hitting without getting hit yourself. Taking cover, using line of sight(such as ricocheting bullets and arcing projectiles like grenades), and calculating damage so that the enemy lines are either crushed or so scattered that they can't muster a threatening retaliation.\n\nBut the combat is only part of what goes down when boarding a shuttle. Half of the fun is just assembling a proper team, utilizing the loadout system to either boost the strengths or cover the weaknesses of your various crewmates. Aboard the shuttles themselves is treasure, or 'swag', to find and gather. The swag itself is generally the game's currency(water; it's good for you!), but occasionally it will be weapons and items of various rarity that provide either a new mechanic for your arsenal or some kind of statistical boost. Collecting the stuff also gains you bonus experience after you get out, so there's multiple incentives to get in and out as quickly as possible. I've redone a ton of stages just trying to find rare stuff and level out characters, experimenting with new character and loadout combinations. Pro-tip, Payroll is awesome.\n\nThere are a few major arcs to the story and level design, each offering some solid enemy types that consistently add more to the shenanigans as you proceed - you've got standard mooks, but some start coming at you with shields that provide them regular cover, enemies that will scatter oil on the ground to ignite under you, melee enemies packed to explode when they die, snipers that attempt to utilize the ricochet, and so much more that I dare not spoil. They're all initially kind of intimidating, and demand that your playstyle adapt quickly to each incoming threat. It provides a pretty meaty challenge, and can feel so satisfying when a plan comes together. Better still, if you're really hurting to get through an objective, the difficulty has five or so settings that allow you to get past a mission and let you build yourself up a bit before tackling it again.\n\nI can't emphasize enough how great it feels when you can clear a room or a threat by sheer wit and skill alone. Things like needling a rocket through a cluttered hallway to hit a target before it can kill an ally, or forcing an enemy to turn around by getting into melee so that a flanking character can crush its health bar. What helps is that most maps are randomly generated, and a lot of stages will spawn in more enemies from various entryways, so it helps to build up the adaptability and skill required to handle later stages. It's very smart about how it both teaches and rewards players.\n\nOh, and there are bosses, and they all kick ass. They're all super distinct and memorable, with some kind of added gimmick that may or may not hint at stuff you might encounter more regularly as the game proceeds. They can be a legitimate struggle, as more and more enemies start forcing their way into the engagement, putting pressure onto the player to finish the boss as quickly as they can before they get overwhelmed. And when their health reaches zero, and the sparks fly, and their body blasts in every direction, the soundtrack kicks in, letting their sweet melodies follow you out; one arm carrying the swag, and the other raised in victory.\n\nOn the subject of audio, this game has an excellent soundtrack - mostly played very quietly in the background, picking up when enemies are nearby, it's a very western and sci-fi series of tracks. Steam-Powered Giraffe did a great deal of the music, which you hear as fanfare for defeating a boss and in the various bars spanning the game. On more than one occasion i'd found myself stopping to just listen, which I think says a great deal more than what i've done for ambience in the past. The weapons and sound effects are also all very crisp and excellent, very distinct sounds that leave you satisfied when you scrap some poor sap thinking he's safe behind that barrel.\n\nThe visuals are a mixed bag, but I think they do a great job of showing you everything you need to see. There's even a minimap you can deploy, in case you ever get confused about things like swag, doors, etc. All of the non-mook types of robots have very memorable designs, and they're given a little more creative freedom since everything is a robot and doesn't have to conform to any particular type of body. Note again the aforementioned character Payroll, whose legs are literally just a big wheel, like Gizmoduck.\n\nThe story isn't particularly grand, but for a game like this, it only needed a modest amount to get the player going - the gameplay was enough to keep me involved, but the presentation of the story was quite excellent. So many little touches with the dialogue and the direction the robots were taking in design allows it to stay fresh all the way through to the end.\n\nThere are some other little disappointments, like character features switching sides when they turn around(Piper's 'hair' shifts from either side of her head), or maybe a thing or two about the story itself, but honestly if that's the worst I have to say about the game then i'd say you've got a pretty solid game on your hands...at least, for me.\n\nI haven't had this much fun with a title since maybe 2013 with Monaco. I've been recommending this to everyone I know that plays games, and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon.

I was also surprised by how satisfying the sound effects are.\n\nAnyways I'm enjoying this game a lot. It's charming and easy to get into without being shallow and repetative: There's a surprising amount of depth both inside and outside of the combat.

Unfortunately the game didn\u2019t meet my expectations but I still found it to be a good game overall. All this to say that when I heard that there was a new game of the SteamWorld series coming out I got a little bit skeptical. When I eventually saw the game itself I knew the chances of enjoying this were far greater than the previous one. [i]\u201dInspired by classics like XCOM and Worms\u201d[/i], they caught my interest right there.\n\n[b][u]Story:[/u][/b]\n\nIn SteamWorld Heist you get to play as Piper, the captain of a ship of Cowbots which is on the run from Royalist forces due to alleged acts of treason, piracy and smuggling. The Royalist forces are led by the Queen and are committed to rebuilding their planet that was shattered a long time ago but, despite their noble intentions, they tend to extort other Cowbots for resources in order to achieve their goal. \n\nOur brave heroes decide it is enough and it\u2019s time to help out the common folk so they start their journey by ridding the Outskirts of the Scrappers, a group of cowbots who use any spare parts of their fallen enemies to either upgrade themselves or increase their ranks. From there forward, the story escalates at a steady pace and along the way you\u2019ll meet other friendly cowbots which can join your crew, each of them having their own unique character and background. \n\n[b][u]Gameplay:[/u][/b]\n\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned before, the devs were inspired by games such as XCOM and Worms, but in essence I\u2019d say they only took 2 key elements from both of those games. From the recent XCOM reboot, they\u2019ve took the 2 moves per turn system in which you can move a character twice within a certain range, move once and then attack or use an ability or simply attacking which will cancel the second phase of that turn. From the Worm series what they\u2019ve adapted to their formula was making it so that, in contrast with XCOM for example, instead of relying on a percentage chance of hitting a target, it is actually the player who aims the weapons and the various different items and abilities. This not only imposes another layer of skill on the player but it also makes the combat more interesting and fun due to the fact that a lot of projectiles (bullets, grenades, etc) can ricochet from walls. \n\nThe combat itself revolves around taking cover behind shields and other obstacles, tactics rather than pure luck based on hit chances, keeping an eye on alarm countdowns which make you proceed faster in order to not get hit by enemy reinforcements or turret emplacements. There weapon and enemy variety is just enough to keep things interesting, from close quarters weapons and enemies to long range fights and even teleporting enemies that can surprise you. The same goes for your crew, given the fact that each has their own set of abilities and play style.\n\nAs far as controls scheme go, i the game is a lot easier to play with a controller rather than with a keyboard and mouse, simply because with the controller you just move your right analog stick in the direction you want to attack, while on keyboard and mouse you have to click with the mouse and play around a bit in order to get the proper trajectory you want.\n\nBesides the combat part of the game, which is what you\u2019ll spend most of your time doing, between missions you can walk around your ship and talk to your crew and go to the space map and select your next destination. On the space map you can go to shops to buy new equipment (including hats), go straight for the main missions or do some side missions. Each mission takes place on a ship with a randomly generated layout and it can consist on collecting [i]\u201dswag\u201d[/i] (loot containers), killing a certain amount of enemies or rescuing someone and after that you need to move all your crew to an escape pod in order to evacuate.You can always go back and replay previous missions in order to level up your crew if you\u2019re having trouble. Upon completing a mission you\u2019ll get EXP which enables you to level up your characters, thus unlocking new abilities. Depending on the amount of swag you gather during a mission you\u2019ll also be able to open containers which can either have water, which acts as a form of currency, treasures or weapons and other equipment such as hats. \n\n[b][u]Visuals & Audio:[/u][/b]\n\nAs far as visuals go I don\u2019t think there is really much that needs to be said, they are clean, good looking and fit the theme perfectly. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen such good looking steampunk robots ever before. The change in scenery as you move to new zones is also very notable and the game never loses its charm.\n\nNow, one of the biggest things about this game for me is the music. I looked it up and apparently the devs have worked with [i]Steam Powered Giraffe[/i], a group which I had never heard before but after looking them up I\u2019m even more glad I played this game, they do an excellent job in setting the right mood at the right times in the game, mainly when you visit the bars and you can see the actual group there playing. Yet, one thing that I wish was in the game was voice acting, I feel like it could add a whole new level of character to the various characters in the game but alas..\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far you\u2019ve probably got the feeling that I thoroughly enjoyed SteamWorld Heist, if you just skipped until the end then let me fill you in.\n\n[h1][b]If you enjoyed SteamWorld Dig world design and theme you\u2019ll probably like this game as well. If you\u2019re into turn-based tactical games that focus on combat chances are you\u2019ll have a great time. The game does get kind of repetitive the longer you play but, at least for me, the combat was fun and challenging enough to keep me going. If you\u2019re just looking for a charming, easy to pick up and play, amazing, gorgeous, fun and cheerful game with solid mechanics and a great steampunk setting I highly recommend you pick this one up.[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1472941337, "timestamp_updated": 1472941373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.678186", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25328355": {"recommendationid": "25328355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002284949", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477011228}, "language": "english", "review": "Thoroughly enjoyable.

[/h1]\n\nhttps://youtu.be/aK1atQC0GHM\n\n.Story.\nThe Earth has been broken into a million pieces and the steam-powered residents that had lived on its surface have taken to the stars.\n\nYou are a gentle cowbot, a moisture farmer by trade, and your attempts to eke out a living are thwarted by the Royalists and a gang of vicious bots known as the Scrappers alike.\n\nAnd so you turn to a life of adventure, the liberation of the common folk, and more importantly, heists!\n\n.Gameplay.\nYou can use your keyboard and mouse or a gamepad. I prefer the latter, so I\u2019ll be talking about those controls from here on out. The majority of gameplay occurs on the battlefield, though the moments between battle will be spent on the main map, which exists as a series of space ships connected. You can travel to each location by selecting it and more open up to you after you beat the preceding level. \n\nThere are two types of areas: battle field and hub (where you can buy equipment and recruit units). So, if you\u2019re looking for a game where you can explore the rich universe, then this isn\u2019t the game for you.\n\nBefore the quest begins, you\u2019re given an information screen that shows you three icons at the top: whether you collected the Epic Swag, the number of units you can take into battle, and the number of stars you can get/have gotten respectively. Underneath that, you can find the objectives that you need to complete and are also given the option to change difficulty. \n\nThe different difficulties include casual, regular, experienced, veteran, and elite. Changing difficulty effects the penalty for failing a mission (you lose a percentage of your stored gallons from 0-50%), the number of enemies, how much damage enemies do, and their health. The higher the difficulty, the higher these stats, but also the more bonus experience you\u2019ll receive at the end of the battle, so there\u2019s a measure of risk versus reward here.\n\nOnce you\u2019re satisfied with the difficulty setting, you can change your loadout. Here, you select the units you want to use as well as their equipment. Units have four equipment slots: a weapon, two utility slots, and a hat. The utility slots can be used for armor, grenades, first aid kits, etc, while the hat is purely cosmetic.\n\nQuests consist of one main objective plus one (or two side, depending on the number of stars you can get) objective that usually (read: almost always) has to do with gathering the Epic Swag available on that level\n\nAnd now, combat.\n\nCombat is turn-based and you can swap behind units mid-turn if need be. You need to aim in order to shoot other units, so if you aren\u2019t very good at estimating distances and line of site in pixels, then you\u2019re SOL. Some guns have a laser sites available, however, so you can play with those until you get better at eyeballing distances.\n\nYou\u2019ll  lead a small team\u2014two to three units\u2014through the bowels of an enemy ship and teamwork is key in order to make sure everyone makes it to the extraction point in one piece. Objects such as barrels can be used as cover. When attacking, you\u2019re told exactly how much damage you\u2019ll do (or a range if applicable).\n\nAfter your glorious victory, you get to open up all of the swag bags and containers you picked up. Inside you\u2019ll find Gallons, equipment, and objects solely for selling to make a profit. Epic Swag containers cannot be picked up more than once.\n\nExperience is awarded at the end of every successful battle. It\u2019s divided evenly between your units. \nYou\u2019re also given a star rating based on: objective(s) (two stars), Epic Swag collected (one star), and any casualties (subtract one star per death).\n\n*If a unit dies, they are reassembled once you go back to your ship. These units receive no experience.\nReputation is used to hire more crew. New crew starts at level 0, so it\u2019s a good idea to go back to earlier stages in order to get them up to speed.\n\n.Atmosphere.\nSteamWorld \u2018s brightly-coloured sprites are detailed and nice to look at. The Scrappers\u2019 ships\u2019 mechanical innards are appropriately dismal, and the pubs and bars that serve as your information hubs are contrastingly warm and well-lit. They also feature fantastic music via a \u201clive band\u201d of bots that sing wholly original tunes.\n\nThe game does a wonderful job of creating a grungy, dystopian world where the general populace consists of steam-powered robots and something as commonplace as water has become a currency. The bots \u201cspeak\u201d in gibberish reminiscent of the older Legend of Zelda titles or even Animal Crossing and the script is rife with humour.\n\n.Longevity.\nIt\u2019s taken me about five hours to beat the first area\u2014including the challenge stages, which are unlocked by playing through normally\u2014on \u201cexperienced\u201d and I managed to get all of the stars while I was at it. I could easily see sinking the promised 15-20 hours into this game, however.\n\nThe difficulties would normally offer greater longevity, but given that the difficulty can be changed at the beginning of a battle without affecting the reputation rating you got previously on another difficulty, there\u2019s no real reason to play on a more difficult setting except to challenge yourself. \n\nI\u2019ll update this with my final verdict once I\u2019ve completed the game.\n\n.Pros and Cons. \n[list]\n[*]Amazing music and art style.\n[*]Humorous writing.\n[*]Limited equipment slots force you to strategize.\n[*]Combat is satisfying, especially if you bounce bullets off of the stage in order to make kills.\n[*]Did I mention that bullets can ricochet? Because that\u2019s really fun.\n[*]Unit classes that have different passive abilities.\n\n[*]The game as a whole is very linear. There\u2019s no sort of choice in what stages you play; you just play them one after the other. The objectives are also very linear, usually involving destroying/collecting an objective and then evacuating. Your unit automatically learns skills upon levelling up. \n[*]Battles swiftly become a matter of running from point A to point B because there\u2019s no point in killing all of the enemies seeing as you don\u2019t receive anything extra for doing so. Enemies also become much, much stronger than your units on higher difficulties, so avoidance is the best tactic one can employ.\n[*]You run out of inventory space very, very quickly. This is more of an annoyance than anything.\n[*]All of these complaints above are minor. My largest problem was the alarm system. After it is first introduced, the game uses the concept into the ground and, rather than being a challenge, it becomes a hassle. The alarms call in more enemies after counting down from [some number] to zero. The clock ticks by every time a turn passes. This would be fine if it didn\u2019t take so long to navigate the map\u2014partially because your units can\u2019t move very far and still deal with enemies, partially because some maps are simply a maze of rooms for no damn reason\u2014and it wasn\u2019t so easy to be overrun as a result.\nThis is, of course, a personal complaint, but it should be taken into consideration because you\u2019ll run into these frequently. \n[/list]\n\n.Bottom line.\nThe pros outweigh the cons for sure and, if you can forgive repetitive gameplay and a linear world, you\u2019ll enjoy SteamWorld Heist. The cast is quirky and loveable, the music is great, and strategizing is fun.\n\nWith a range of difficulties and additional challenge stages, there\u2019s something for strategy lovers of every skill level here.

The pseudo sequel to 2013\u2019s SteamWorld Dig, Heist shares many elements from the modern XCOM and Shadowrun series, albeit in the 2D space, and is just as good as its contemporaries.\n\nHaving never played the first game in the series, Heist was a great introduction to a world that is very reminiscent of the Borderlands and Firefly universes. The wonderful meld of western/sci fi and steampunk is a great match and is wonderfully realized in Heist. Special shout out to Steam Powered Giraffe who orchestrated a tremendous soundtrack that only enhances the setting of the game. Tonally, the game is very consistent and forms a solid identity.\n\nOne of the main hooks for Heist is that every level is procedurally generated. This allows for multiple playthroughs and grinding to avoid getting stale as fast since level layout and enemy location will be different each time. The other back of the box feature is that unlike XCOM, Heist\u2019s gameplay is based purely on skill rather than luck. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love XCOM, but boy is it frustrating when you miss a shot with 95% accuracy and you have your gun square in the alien\u2019s face. In SteamWorld Heist, you aim your shots, so the accuracy is completely up to you, which is quite refreshing. The game allows for both long and short ranged characters, but I found long range to be much more successful (especially when you have a rifle with a laser scope).\n\nThe game throws enough environmental and enemy variety at you to keep the 10+ hour adventure fresh and well-paced throughout. There is a story there for those who want it, and while charming, I found it took a backseat to the rock solid mechanics that the game presents you. Speaking of great mechanics, I especially loved the fast forward feature when moving your team around. When you select a teammate to move around, you can skip the running animation entirely by holding down a button. This was a wonderful addition as it can make certain missions much less tedious as a result.\n\nSteamWorld Heist is an entertaining sidescrolling, turn based strategy game that can be played as casually or as hardcore as you\u2019d like. The art and music are lovely and the world is quite amusing. There is plenty of game to be had here, especially if you plan on doing New Game+. In addition, there is a somewhat sizeable DLC at a nominal price that is well worth the investment. I greatly enjoyed myself with Heist and hope to see more games from this universe in the future from a great up and coming studio.\n", "timestamp_created": 1471659316, "timestamp_updated": 1471659316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25021880": {"recommendationid": "25021880", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972052573", "num_games_owned": 544, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471655035}, "language": "english", "review": "Lazy, short review:\n\nTruly an entertaining game if you enjoy turn-based combat.

Form. It\u2019s the dev team\u2019s second game to include this setting, after SteamWorld Dig and while they feature different genres, both present us with colorful and likeable characters within a fascinating steampunk-from-outer-space world.\n \n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nI\u2019ve seen few hybrids of strategy and platforming outside of the well established Worms franchise. I have to say that SteamWorld Heist managed to impress me with its over the top cast of pirate robots and constant carefully planned action sequences aboard enemy ships and bases. You have a complex customization system when it comes to your mechanized crew. You get to shape them by your own taste and change everything from their inventory, appearance and even their skillsets. The turn-based shooting mechanics work fine once you get used to them and the scaling difficulty. \n \nFor a 2D side-scroller, the graphical diversity is more than enough and few levels seem to repeat themselves while the weapon effects offer even more eye-candy. The game\u2019s soundtrack features some very catchy tunes which only add to the game\u2019s sci-fi atmosphere. No complaints in this regard.\n \n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+ Challenging gameplay emphasising on strategic thinking\n+ Memorable cast of characters and enviroments\n+ Steam Achievements & Trading Cards\n \n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- No multiplayer\n- Slightly overpriced\n \n[h1]Result / Final thoughts[/h1]\nEven after several hours, I was still not even a bit bored by this title. It truly serves as a good example of what you can do with these particular hybrid gameplay mechanics once you replace homicidal worms with space robot pirates. Comic relief was also present in decent amount and the game does provide both Cards and Achievements. Apart from the total lack of an MP mode, the price tag feels like too much is being asked even if SteamWorks Heist definitely feels like a more polished indie title than Steam has gotten used to. At the time of this writing, the title is still being sold for 20 dollars/euros (+more for DLC). With a modest price drop or when bought on Sale, it becomes a very good deal for a charming strategy game.\n \n[b]Rating 8/10[/b]\n \n[quote]This review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews]Imperial Reviews[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Cubbes]Cubbes[/url].[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1470657434, "timestamp_updated": 1482920689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24763268": {"recommendationid": "24763268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134395649", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471334055}, "language": "italian", "review": "[b]\nRecensione modificata.

A lot of what I think this game does well has to do with the fact that it simplifies this genre, but at the same time, manages to make it fun.  Of course, this means that this game doesn\u2019t have as many deep and innovative features compared to other similar games, but honestly, I don\u2019t think this game needed it.  To me, this simplification created more room to make a game that is accessible to play for anyone and I think that reason alone is enough for me to highly recommend playing this game.  So if you\u2019re looking to step foot into the turn-based strategy game genre for the first time and would like to play a game that is not only friendly to beginners but also fun to play as well, then look no further than Steamworld Heist.\n\nHere's a video review that I made for this game will give you a better idea of what this game is all about and will further explain my thoughts about different features of this game.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/J7o6oLaj_e0\n", "timestamp_created": 1470589529, "timestamp_updated": 1470589529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24754862": {"recommendationid": "24754862", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971351980", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470552540}, "language": "german", "review": "Super Spiel mit Langzeitmotivation, eigenet sich ideal f\u00fcr zwischendurch, wobei aus ''nur schnell eine Mission'' doch mehrere werden.\n\nEine Perle f\u00fcr kleines Geld, klare Kaufempfehlung!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1470553006, "timestamp_updated": 1479975422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24740419": {"recommendationid": "24740419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035259850", "num_games_owned": 427, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481395309}, "language": "english", "review": "an absolutely solid, funny and charming strategy game, like diet xcom, only flaw is that it ended, cant wait for some DLC", "timestamp_created": 1470481892, "timestamp_updated": 1470481892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24730052": {"recommendationid": "24730052", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014839327", "num_games_owned": 652, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496262935}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a bit like Worms with rogue robots in space, although more stylish imho.\nThe campaign is quite long and the character interactions are enjoyable.\nAlso, the game is limited in a good way, it is possible to play in shorter periods, so it is more for casuals, not like X-COM for example.\nThe art style is refresing, and so is the music (especially the songs in the hubs of space ;).\n\nI would say it is a casual strategy, with a unique style, it is worth giving a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1470425197, "timestamp_updated": 1470425197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518519", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24718034": {"recommendationid": "24718034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006532181", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 34, "last_played": 1515547013}, "language": "english", "review": "In short: buy this game\n\nIn long: buuuuuuuuuuy thiiiiiiiiiis gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaameeeeeeeeeeee\n\nIn detail: a gorgeous steampunk robot Firely XCOM without the RNG shenanigans. The theme is fantastic, the art beautiful, the characters great, and the gameplay fun and rewarding. You manually aim all your shots, so you miss not because you didn't pray to RNGesus, but because your aim was off. The ricochet mechanic means you can do insane shots that involve bouncing a bullet off two pieces of cover, taking some poor bot's hat off (because it's shiny and you want it), and then hitting some other bot square in his face. Weapon design has good variety with enough special guns with unique characteristics that it's always interesting, and unlike XCOM (where you field your A-team wherever possible), mixing up your squad composition is necessary as squad size varies between missions, and different characters' strengths will play into different level layouts. Also, most of the levels are prodecurally generated, so you'll only see the same ship twice on special missions (ie, boss fights).\n\nOverall a fantastic game.", "timestamp_created": 1470362817, "timestamp_updated": 1470362817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469799", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24715051": {"recommendationid": "24715051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263098298", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470347363}, "language": "english", "review": "its a great small game and i really recommend this if you like xcom,\nbut i just reccomend it anyways\nand i really hope that more will be added to this awesome game.\ni cant spell.", "timestamp_created": 1470346819, "timestamp_updated": 1499483641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24700517": {"recommendationid": "24700517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045789453", "num_games_owned": 639, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1607, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512433220}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game!\n2D XCOM-style turn based combat wrapped in a genuinely funny(read: not entirely memebased) and engaging story.

The wonderfully spellbinding effect of a really good game is usually brutally cut off by some sexist aspect of the game, which reminds you that it was exclusively made by straight white men that do not realise their privileges.

They are known as Cowbots and they survive by farming moisture and mining what they can from near to exhausted land. But that is not all, gangs of nasty Scrappers are ranging across the galaxy. Their major talent is to acquire scrap-metals and water from hardworking Cowbots! On top of that, they need to avoid the bullies, Diesel Royalists, who run the galaxy! But there is more, much more. . .  Bots, it\u2019s time for you to enter SteamWorld Heist!\n\nSteamWorld Heist is a 2D turn-based strategy game where you take control of Piper Faraday, a well-known smuggler/occasional pirate and her crew. First, you will need to choose the gameplay difficulty, from casual to elite. Your first mission is a very good tutorial to get familiar with the controls and how the game works.  At the end of the tutorial, you will acquire your first crew members. . .  the magnificent \u201cSeabrass!\u201d Then you will get your first look at your spaceship and meet Wonky, your faithful pilot! \n\nOn the spaceship top level, where Wonky is steering your vessel, you will find your operations table with a space map. From here, you can activate your next mission; docking at bars, arms traders vessels and other important destinations. Each mission will have three clear stars underneath them. If you managed to achieve all objectives within the mission, you will be rewarded with three gold stars. Try to accumulate as many stars as possible as you will need them later on to unlock new destinations.\n\nNow that you are ready to launch a mission, select one from the space map; see the objectives, how many crew members you can take into the battle with you and get straight to the loadout menu. In the loadout, you will have four inventory spots to fill in. When you are happy with your selection, jump into the mission, which is procedurally generated. Wonky will carefully dock onto the enemy ship, drop you off and the rest is all up to you!\n\nThe really big difference in this turn-based strategy game is the ability to manually aim the guns of your characters directly at your enemies or even use the wall for your bullets to ricochet and hit an enemy robot. You will be able to hide behind barrels, but avoid using explosive barrels as a cover - Your robot might become scrap-metal very quickly! Make sure to pick up bags and chests of loot as they contain either water, weapons or armour. When you achieve the main objective(s) make your way to the escape pod and your mission will end.\n\nAt the end of the mission, your character will own experience points which go towards levelling up. Then you will find out what new items, or how much water, is in the loot you picked up. If you earned a fair bit of water, try to head up to bars or arms dealers to purchase new goodies, as water is a currency in SteamWorld Heist.\n\nI really like the 2D artworks in this game. Control-wise, either you use the gamepad or the mouse and keyboard; they are easy to learn. Good story and fun dialogues.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tGreat 2D artworks\n-\tProcedurally generated levels \n-\tGood Story and dialogues\n-\tVery good gameplay and easy to learn\n-\tAchievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~  \n\n-\tYour characters will not avoid or block a melee attack \n-\tDoes not have the ability to compare stats when you buy a new weapon\n\nSteamWorld Heist is a great turn-based strategy game. If it\u2019s your first game it that genre, you will be hooked! If you\u2019re a veteran it this genre, you love it!\n\n9/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

Those are \"Casual\", \"Regular\", \"Experienced\", \"Veteran\", and \"Elite\", and as it increases in difficulty, it also yields more bonus experience the harder it is (and you can change it before you start any mission).  \n\nAt your disposal is a [b]space pirate crew[/b] composed of robots referred to as [i]\"steambots\"[/i] and is led by [b]Captain Piper Faraday[/b]. Along the way, you will find recruitable characters that can be enlisted by either proving your worth through the amount of [i]\"reputation\"[/i] you have, paying them with [i]\"swag\"[/i], or in some cases will join you by their own accord.\n\nThe gameplay focuses on mission-based levels which yields reputation in the form of golden stars that indicates how well you performed on that certain level once you clear it.There are objectives that you need to follow and once they are cleared, an escape route will be opened for your members to finish the mission. You can also find loot called [b]\"swag bags\"[/b] and [b]\"epic swag\"[/b] in these stages that appears in a form of a sack and a box respectively, and its contents are unknown until you have revealed them at the stage's end.\n\nThe way the [b]battle system[/b] works in the game is [b]turn-based[/b] and each unit can do [b]two types of action per turn[/b]. Moving through the area and [b]re-positioning[/b] yourself while in the orange highlighted area will allow to still be able do an action after moving, but if you [b]\"sprint\"[/b] (represented by blue areas), your character will end its turn once you move on its position.\nWhile you are able to do action, [b]you can either fire your weapon, use your secondary equipment, or use your \"active abilities\".[/b] \n\n[b]Each weapon has its own merits, damage area, and aiming type[/b] which are all specified on their descriptions. In accordance to this, your characters can only equip certain types of weapon available for them (for example, Piper can only use Sharpshooter and Handgun weapons). Another type of equipment are the [b]hats and secondary equipment[/b], and unlike weapons, any character will be able to equip them (though hats are purely for fashion, while the secondary equipment has their respective uses).\n\nUpon [b]finishing the mission[/b], you are will [b]receive the reputation[/b] according to what objectives you have cleared and an additional star per epic swag you get minus the number of fallen members. You will also be able to unlock your loots and reveal what item they might be and receive [b]awarded experience points[/b] that is distributed evenly to all alive crew members after the mission. When a crew member levels-up, they will get either a passive or active skill that will help through your future endeavors.\n\n\n\n[h1][u][b]The Pros[/b][/u][/h1]\n\n[list]\n\n    [*][b]Fun and Challenging Battle System[/b] - I really love the mechanics of their battle system as well as its weapon physics (like the ricocheting of the bullets and the splash damage from explosives), and even enacts the unsteadiness of the aim which requires both calculation and perfect timing of the player (which further heightens the challenge). It also has that added satisfaction when you land a calculated no-scope MLG pro shot, and that surprise factor when you accidentally hit an enemy that wasn't planned. Overall, it brings a very wholesome gameplay that makes you wanting more and more.\n\n    [*][b]Tons of Content[/b] - From the numerous items, weapons and equipment (and swag) for you to collect, to the various characters available to recruit and play as, and the dozens of challenging missions that you can engage on, you can easily have a day\u2019s worth of hours in gameplay time that awaits you. Oh, and the hats. Have I mentioned that there are various hats (like cat-on-top hat or some anime-related hat) available for you to suit-up your steambots?\n\n    [*][b]Brilliant Soundtracks[/b] - Not only that the sound effects perfectly fits the sci-fi/steampunk nature of the game's theme, it also showcases some really nice songs/soundtracks that catches the ambiance of what a classic midnight bar should be. My favorite track is [i]\"Honeybee\"[/i] by [b]Steam Powered Giraffe[/b].\n\n    [*][b]Clean Game Graphics[/b] - Similar to the developer's earlier game (SteamWorld Dig), this new entry to the series presents a very clean art design throughout the whole game which is something that I always expect a game would have since not only it looks visually appealing, but also prevents possible confusion that players might encounter in terms of either the game mechanics or menus. \n\n[/list] \n\n\n[h1][u][b]The Cons[/b][/u][/h1]\n\n[list]\n\n    [*][b]Lack of Ability Choices[/b] - To be clear, I am pertaining to the lack of \"skill trees\" that are normally available in role-playing games. While the game is great at its current set-up, I do think that it would be more enjoyable for players to be able to customize their preferred characters rather than blindly waiting for the abilities/power-ups unlock as they level-up. For example, you kept on playing a certain character that you got early in the game because you already invested the experience points to that one just to know that another character is more suited to your preferences/play-style. \n\n    [*][b]No Co-op/Multi-player Mode[/b] - Unlike the X-COM and Worms games, both of which inspired the battle system of this game, the game only has single-player story mode available (at least during this review has been posted), in which is pretty important in terms of replayability and gives its players the option to enjoy the game with their family, friends or even duke it out with their rivals.\n\n    [*][b]Repetitive Gameplay[/b] - Same old nemesis by the games from this genre. While the game is very fun and challenging that will occupy you for hours and hours of gameplay, it doesn't deny the fact that the same gameplay is presented during the course of the game. I was actually excited when I reached one the point of the game where a certain NPC tells you about a \"brawl club\" that you can join in since it might be a mini-game/mode added that is different from the regular battles. And while that mission did introduce a new part of the game, where it introduced a three-way battle between you and two other factions, the battle premise is no different which was disappointing in a certain way. \n\n[/list] \n\n\n[h1][u][b]Final Thoughts[/b][/u][/h1]\n\nFor those who are fond of turn-based games, this game is easily a [b]MUST-BUY[/b]. And for the people who even have the slightest of interest of playing, it is worth the try and am pretty sure you will love it.\n\n[b]Rating[/b] - 9.4/10 \n\n[quote]This review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/elitegives]Elite Giveaways[/url], check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1468040041, "timestamp_updated": 1468045951, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.766162", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24174335": {"recommendationid": "24174335", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990832473", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 542, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487794860}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey the rumors are 100% true this is one very good game to kill some time it kind of reminds me of space runner", "timestamp_created": 1467954621, "timestamp_updated": 1467954621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24169179": {"recommendationid": "24169179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026100731", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466300914}, "language": "english", "review": "SteamWorld Heist had actually been on my radar for quite a while. Mentioned by Austin Walker on The Giant Beastcast podcast earlier this year, the phrase \u201c2D X-Com\u201d set my hopes high. Not having a 3DS, I had to anxiously wait for it to come to PC. Every month or so I\u2019d looked to see if there was even a release date, until finally, recently, it popped up on Steam.\n\nMade by Image & Form, it\u2019s been my turn-based tactical game of choice. These are the same developers who did SteamWorld Dig, which has the same aesthetic and charm, but is an adventure game in real-time. In Heist you play as a captain of a mercenary group of steambots (robots powered by steam). You\u2019re a bit of a rogue with a heart of gold. The Han Solo of steambot piracy. It\u2019s all presented charmingly in 2D, except for a couple of cutscenes. Each mission has turn-based combat also from a 2D perspective, and it takes some of the baseline mechanics from the recent X-Com series and repurposes them. The two mainstays are a cover system, and an action point system tied to movement.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch, where things break from X-Com or other turn-based cover shooters: you\u2019re the one lining up your shots. No percentage based shooting, no hidden dice rolls. It\u2019s all based on your ability to line up shots, in a very Worms-like manner, and have them connect. There\u2019s a strong focus on being able to ricochet shots, in addition to using cover, which has a really enjoyable kinetic feel to it. I found myself turning my head to the side to try to line up shots. Pulling off a long shot, or a shot with a ricochet, is a blast of endorphins for me. It\u2019s a \u201cproblem solved\u201d moment, where a tactical challenge was faced and defeated.\n\nYour character\u2019s aim of each shot does \u2018float\u2019, for lack of a better term, up and down just enough to add to the challenge but not unfairly. There\u2019s a level of anticipation while you\u2019re trying to line it up. And while some guns have a laser sight, most do not. Not really a problem with close range guns like shotguns, but bouncing explosives and pistols each present a challenge and heighten the stakes.\n\nAdditionally, you also have a roster of characters that have different activatable abilities and strengths. And that last bit might actually be more crucial than I\u2019m giving it credit, as it really added to my enjoyment in switching and exploring the different classes (for the most part\u200a\u2014\u200asorry Bea!). They offered enough variety and provided some different solutions to the missions you run into.\n\nAll of this has me actually considering a 2nd run. Most of that has to do with the tactical layer. The engagements were fun to solve and making those shots never got old. The missions themselves had enough variety, and the overall length was solid. I finished the game on the default difficulty level (Experienced) in 14 hours. Playing a couple missions here and there was easy and enjoyable, and while I was ready for things to end, I wouldn\u2019t mind restarting on a harder difficulty.\nI didn\u2019t find the story particularly engaging, but the bits of humor scattered throughout were amusing enough. The music was a mixed bag as the general background and battle music was a little too monotonous, but some of the songs you heard in the bars or at the end were great and brought a light-hearted tone. The visuals speak for themselves and the animations were well done and brought their own charms as well.\n\nIn closing, X-Com or Final Fantasy Tactics, this is not, and thank goodness. Not that I don\u2019t want more of those games (see Arcadian Atlas for a modern hopeful at recreating the latter), but I definitely want turn-based games going in more directions. Using 2D physics is a fun way to mix the genre up. I\u2018d love to see this concept revisited, and possibly expanded upon.", "timestamp_created": 1467933095, "timestamp_updated": 1467933095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542276", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24161465": {"recommendationid": "24161465", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971793223", "num_games_owned": 831, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466121383}, "language": "english", "review": "\"This is a game where you will just have fun...worth a buy!\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzoFpmMiMis", "timestamp_created": 1467911216, "timestamp_updated": 1467911216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24159585": {"recommendationid": "24159585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073764772", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502353860}, "language": "english", "review": "You know what?

Right of the bat, the game strikes you with its art style, its vivid setting and its compelling soundtrack. I was hooked from the start, there is no denying that.\n\nCharacters speak volumes with their designs, much more than with their actually lines of dialogues, and while there is a plot, the fights and gameplay are where the game shines. As nice as the music or the graphics are, it is the combat that makes the game: overcome many enemies; collect their hats for an added challenge, unlocking them for your characters; and loot stuff!\nTo overcome the odds, you can use up to four heroes at times; as many as there are character classes. Each hero as its own set of skills however, even if some are redundant among them. The battles are short, requiring your aim to be precise, which often necessitates a certain perspective on the position and reposition of the characters during the fights.\nObviously, the great joy of the game comes from overcoming a mission by the skin of your teeth and going through the collected loot and swag, unlocking support items and weapons. A few of them change the way the game is played, especially with ricochet shoots, -which make trick shoots, in the cramped hulls of the spaceships, a delight-, but most of them are rather standard, offering only incremental improvements.\n\nThe same can also be said about the levelling-up system. While each character has at least one skill specific to him or herself, most of the level bonuses are only a flat improvements to health or skill damage, making level gains a little bit lacklustre by the end. However, it does scale nicely with the tougher fights and enemies ahead. As such, the difficulty of the game feels rather tight: I never felt, having lost a mission, that I couldn't have done better or that the mission was impossible to succeed.\n\nAs a side note, I only found myself switching up my dream team of characters during missions for varieties sake only, and regretting this decision more often than not, as nasty surprises loomed ahead. Of the pool of ten characters you can get back to, I sadly only ever used half of them regularly, if that.\n\nThe game's length genuinely surprised me however, with over 15 hours for one playthrough. Missions are replayable, for loot, hats and experience and there is a 'newgame+' mode, apparently offering even more hats to collect, but little else.\nStill, I believe I got my money's worth out of it and, more importantly, I had a very pleasant time with SteamWorld Heist. I wholeheartedly recommend this game, especially if the price is cut down.\n", "timestamp_created": 1467685000, "timestamp_updated": 1467685000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516927", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24095755": {"recommendationid": "24095755", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034072369", "num_games_owned": 8141, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467674295}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] SteamWorld Heist [/h1]\n\nDISCLAIMER: I received this product for no cost for the purpose of reviewing. However, this does not affect my views and opinions of the game.\n\nSteamWorld Heist is a colourful 2D turn-based strategy shooter. The game-play is in the same vein as \"XCOM\" or \"Worms\", in a sense where you have precision based skill shots, as well as having certain terrain/objects provide cover for the player. The art style very much reminds me of the other SteamWorld games, as well as \"Awesomenauts\". \n\n--------\n\n[b] Graphics: 8 / 10 [/b] \n\nI've always enjoyed the art-style and design of SteamWorld Dig, and the same is true for this game. The unit and environmental designs are very vibrant and colorful. The animation quality is very good, and the cartoon-y steampunk visuals are something that I really like. Even the cut-scenes look really well designed and have a lot going for them. The minor gripe I have with the graphics, are the resolutions settings. Although the settings menu has a lot to offer and gives plenty of options (considering it being a 2D game), I could not find any options for resolutions, though it's possible I wasn't looking hard enough. The optimization of the game seems fine, I didn't have any problems running the game. The game should run fine on any low to mid-tier graphics card and CPU. \n\n--------\n\n[b] Sound: 7 / 10 [/b] \n\nThe sound assets are very well done. Although music is subjective, the soundtrack is catchy and sounds good. When I first started the game, I was taken by a nice guitar melody that was on the menu screen. There's also some narration at some parts of the game, as well as voice acting which sound great. None of the sound assets ever really get boring or repetitive,  and even the gunshot/skill sounds sound decent. The dialogue in the game is also very well done. \n\n--------\n\n[b] Mechanics: 8 / 10 [/b] \n\nThe game's mechanics are really well put together. The controls are understandable and can be changed to your liking. You can use a keyboard or a joy-pad for the game. You pretty much move your units in turn order trying to eliminate the enemies on the screen. For every unit, you have a limited amount of movements per turn, as well and an attacking action. You can take cover behind objects and then try to shoot the enemy behind your cover, though the enemy can also do the same. Projectiles you fire can bounce off objects. This can be used to your advantage in hitting enemies you normally couldn't with a straight line of fire. You have to manually aim and shoot your guns, kind of like those virtual pool/snooker games. This means there's some skill involved when firing. \n\nThroughout the game you will come across new units to play with and even find hats to wear. You also get experience after completing a stage which levels up your character and provides them with new stats and abilities. You can also pick up a variety of weapons within the game that change your damage output, but can also have other abilities and effects. There are some units that that are only able to use certain weapons as your units have different classes. Loot bags can be found in every stage as well as a special loot bag that usually contains better equipment as well as reputation. As your reputation increases, you can use it to unlock new areas to explore as well as hire new units. \n\nSome stages are a little more complicated than others, sometimes it's a simple run and gun mission, while others have an alarm system. In this type of scenario, you have a certain amount of turns before an alarm goes off. Once it does, turrets will be put up or more enemies will appear, making things a little more difficult for your units. This means your plays have to be a lot more efficient, and a lot more thought has to be placed into your actions. You can always go back to previous stages to earn more experience and loot. \n\n--------\n\n[b] Final Personal Remarks: [/b]\n\nThe game is very enjoyable. Unfortunately, I'm not very good at these types of games. Though there is a difficulty selection which lets the game cater to newer players to this genre, as well as veterans. So I think I'll be turning the difficulty down a bit. Even as I type this, I'm listening to the music within the game, as I really do enjoy it. The game looks and sounds great. It's very satisfying to play and there's quite a bit of fun to be had here.\n\nThanks to the devs for giving me the opportunity to review the game, as well as anyone who took this review into consideration, I hope it helped.", "timestamp_created": 1467674151, "timestamp_updated": 1474656193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563774", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24072957": {"recommendationid": "24072957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044098267", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470409605}, "language": "english", "review": "[table][tr][td][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CuratorPixel] Curator Pixel[/url] - [i]Pursuing objectivity with a critical eye[/i][/td][/tr][/table]\n\nOriginally a Nintendo 3DS title, [i]Steamworld Heist[/i] manages to succesfully transition to the Steam platform with increased fidelity. The developer decided to take their next title in a different direction, drawing inspiration from games like  XCOM and Worms. The end result is a game with a unique combination of mechanics which make for addictive and rewarding gameplay.\n\n[h1]Presentation[/h1]\nDespite being set in a time of struggle, [i]Steamworld Heist[/i] manages to maintain a beautiful artstyle, with every asset showing high levels of fidelity.  Characters are very well animated throughout the experience, and on top of that, the game features fully voiced cutscenes which help further set the tone of the game. Nothing strikes you as lazy or out of place in this game.\n\nThe audio is also impressive and packs a real punch. Great sound effects  give the player a sense of satisfaction when downing an enemy, or a sense of urgency once they hear an alarm go off. The game features a great soundtrack as well, from the main menu\u2019s theme, to the dramatic combat music and catchy tavern songs.  All music is performed in-studio by the band Steam Powered Giraffe.\n\n[h1]Plot[/h1]\nEarth has blown up, making water a very scarce resource. The game\u2019s main character, Piper Faraday, and her crew of smugglers will have to discover why the Scrappers, a criminal organization, are causing so much trouble with farmers and other citizens. While handling this situation, you must also keep a healthy stock of water supplies, and focus on avoiding the attention of the anti-smuggler Royal Space Force.\n\n[h1]Interface/Controls[/h1]\nThe interface feels very natural. It is easy to understand where your character can move, and which objects can be used for cover. Each character's path has a color which indicates if they can still shoot after moving. Damage is also presented in a form that is easy to comprehend, even without the need for massive numbers which clutter the screen. The game also features a very simple, but effective, inventory system, giving you the option to equip items to your crew members before each mission.\n\nThe controls are very well done. It is easy to cycle through your crew members and issue them orders. The game recommends the use of a gamepad, although less optimal mouse and keyboard controls are available in the options menu.  \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n[i]Steamworld Heist[/i] is primarily a turn-based strategy game. What sets this game apart from similar games is the 2D nature of it, and the ability to manually aim your weapons. This introduces a level of skill that is very unique for this genre, as you won\u2019t be depending on hit chances and critical strike percentages. If a shot misses, then it\u2019s solely your fault. On top of that, some of the game\u2019s weapons feature a ricochet mechanic, meaning you can get really creative with how to shoot enemies that are taking cover.\n\nThe game has five levels of difficulty: Casual, Regular, Experienced, Veteran and Elite. So if you\u2019re the type of player who only wants to see the story, you can do just that. Or if you\u2019re up for a challenge that is more intense, you can go with the higher difficulties. Each mission is randomly generated, giving the game replayability. However, due to its randomized nature, luck can work for or against us. If a player finds themself struggling to complete a particular mission, they can opt to die or abandon and restart, hoping that the next generated map will be \u201ceasier\u201d. Despite what could be considered a flaw in any other game, [i]Steamworld Heist[/i] deters this in a very smart way by introducing a currency penalty every time we fail.\n\nWe collect loot in every mission, and are rewarded with reputation and experience at the end of each mission. Reputation is granted based on how successful a run was, and can be used to unlock new paths. It can also be used to recruit new crew members who want to join our cause. The game punishes sloppy performance, not only by diminishing the reputation gain, but also by preventing dead crew members from earning any experience at all.\n\nThe backstory of your crew members can be explored by initiating a conversation with them in between missions. An exclamation mark over their head will indicate when they have something new to say, which is reminiscent of other games in the genre. By not shoving a bunch of backstory into the player's face, the game provides a nice balance between gameplay and narrative, allowing the player to engage in the game\u2019s lore if they so desire.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[i]Steamworld Heist[/i] oozes with quality in almost every aspect of the game. It would be nice to have a multiplayer mode and a map editor, but this is no excuse to skip the game. Fun characters, amazing game design, and great music make this title one that every fan of the genre should play. At the same time, thanks to its flexible difficulty options, it serves as an entry point for players who want to get into the genre.\n\n[table][tr][td][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25303734/][u]Follow Curator Pixel for more analyses and reviews[/u][/url][/td][/tr][/table]", "timestamp_created": 1467616934, "timestamp_updated": 1467616934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640511", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24061763": {"recommendationid": "24061763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029404144", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504642515}, "language": "english", "review": "Just as you enter menu screen, \"The Stars\" by SPG starts playing.\nI find no reasons not to give this game a pzitive review after that.", "timestamp_created": 1467581131, "timestamp_updated": 1467581131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498534", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24059674": {"recommendationid": "24059674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014717259", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514560238}, "language": "german", "review": "Dieses Spiel war ein \u00dcberraschungshit f\u00fcr mich.

[i]Steamworld Heist[/i] desembarca olvid\u00e1ndose de la f\u00f3rmula que hizo famoso a su predecesor, para, en un movimiento arriesgado en pos del avance del medio, transformarse en un juego de estrategia por turnos repleto de acci\u00f3n, bastante alejado de la zona de [i]confort[/i] en la que se hallaba anteriormente.\n\n[h1]Presentaci\u00f3n[/h1]\nAmbientado en un entorno al m\u00e1s estilo steampunk, en \u00e9ste dist\u00f3pico futuro se aprecia un acabado impecable con un dise\u00f1o gr\u00e1fico en dos dimensiones. Aunque ostentador de un gran arte visual, la acci\u00f3n de los combates har\u00e1 a uno dejar de lado la belleza de los escenarios que le rodea en pos de concentrarse en alcanzar la victoria, utilizando su dise\u00f1o y objetos con dicho fin.\n\nEl audio es como la jugabilidad, r\u00e1pido y din\u00e1mico, no hay voces; tan s\u00f3lo sonidos cortos que los personajes hacen al dialogar. El resto est\u00e1 todo volcado a funciones, uso de objetos y m\u00fasica de ambiente bien implementada, que le viene al juego como anillo al dedo, de la mano del grupo folk/rock [i]Steam Powered Giraffe[/i], pueden ser vistos actuando en diferentes escenarios visitados, como si fuesen otros personajes m\u00e1s del juego.\n\nHablamos de un t\u00edtulo que goza de un apartado art\u00edstico bello y t\u00e9cnicamente pulido. Impacta positivamente su dise\u00f1o de personajes, objetos y niveles, de los cuales se echan en falta su variedad, pues a pesar de la cantidad, el dise\u00f1o art\u00edstico los hace bastante parecidos los unos a los otros.\n\n[h1]Argumento[/h1]\nEl juego deja en claro sus bases desde el vamos: la Tierra fue hecha pedazos, y los robots a base de vapor que all\u00ed habitaban se vieron forzados a vagar por el cosmos en busca de recursos para subsistir. Como si eso no fuera suficiente, hay dos facciones de enemigos a enfrentar, ellos son los saqueadores, que est\u00e1n esclavizando a aquellos que a\u00fan residen en los restos de la Tierra, sac\u00e1ndole la \u00faltima gota de recursos, y por otro lado, los Lealistas, robots m\u00e1s avanzados a base de di\u00e9sel que parecen representar una dictadura corporativa. Todo eso, y algo m\u00e1s\u2026\n\nLa capitana de una nave pirata, Piper Faraday, junto a un grupo de contrabandistas, iniciar\u00e1 un viaje por el espacio para darles una lecci\u00f3n a los saqueadores y recolectar recursos. Recorrer\u00e1 pues, distintos lugares en donde reclutar\u00e1 nuevas tropas que la ayuden en la tarea.\n\n[h1]Controles/Interfaz[/h1]\nEl juego carece de modo ventana sin bordes, pero lo compensa con sus bajos requisitos y estabilidad t\u00e9cnica. Todas las opciones presentes, ya sean t\u00e9cnicas o de personalizaci\u00f3n, presentan un apartado muy simple y f\u00e1cil de manejar.\n\nPudi\u00e9ndose jugar tanto con rat\u00f3n como con teclado, el juego expande su manera de ser jugado, incluso pudiendo combinar ambos perif\u00e9ricos a la hora de la acci\u00f3n. Lamentablemente, a la hora de usar el rat\u00f3n para disparar, puede resultar molesta la auto-mira agresiva hacia aquello a lo que queramos disparar.\n\nLejos de todo aquello, los controles son s\u00f3lidos y c\u00f3modos tanto para los veteranos del g\u00e9nero como para los reci\u00e9n llegados.\n\n[h1]Jugabilidad[/h1]\nEn [i]Steamworld Heist[/i] uno hace uso de su propio estilo de juego, sea que seamos lentos y met\u00f3dicos, directos o a distancia, o incluso kamikazes. Las diferentes maneras de hacer lo mismo generan una experiencia diferente para cada jugador. No obstante, la dificultad progresiva del juego forzar\u00e1 a uno a reintentar el nivel, actualizando su tipo de estrategia y adecu\u00e1ndose al tipo de circunstancia presentada.\n\nDiferentes tipos de tropas, todos \u00fanicos, capaces de resistir mayor da\u00f1o, m\u00e1s versados en el manejo de un arma en particular, y la l\u00edder del grupo, con sus propias habilidades especiales. Un gran repertorio de armas, que resultan ser m\u00e1s de 100 y m\u00e1s los \u00edtems a equiparles, cualquiera puede encontrar su zona de confort para cada nivel con cada combinaci\u00f3n ganadora a escoger.\n\nSobre escoger, no s\u00f3lo tendremos a disposici\u00f3n un arma, pues aunque el sistema de equipamiento de los personajes es b\u00e1sico, impecable y simple, tambi\u00e9n tendremos a elecci\u00f3n de equipamientos kits de curaci\u00f3n, bombas y otros equipo para mejorar habilidades de movimiento, protecci\u00f3n y dem\u00e1s. Cada personaje posee tres ranuras de equipo que deben ser usadas estrat\u00e9gicamente, pues de eso depender\u00e1 el \u00e9xito de muchas batallas.\n\nUna vez en la acci\u00f3n, ser\u00e1 menester utilizar el dise\u00f1o del nivel, tanto como objetos que proporcionan protecci\u00f3n, para inclinar la balanza a favor de Piper y su grupo. Al hacer uso de barriles para ponerse a cubierto, los enemigos podr\u00e1n romperlos si lo da\u00f1an lo suficiente, y en caso de buscar resguardo tras explosivos, lo mejor es ir pensando en qu\u00e9 hacer cuando haya que repetir el nivel. Una vez a cubierto, se debe emplear el sistema para apuntar y disparar, pues la trayectoria de las balas se muestra en la pantalla si esta posee una mira l\u00e1ser; las balas son capaces de rebotar contra las superficies, ampliando el marco de estrategia, considerando adem\u00e1s, que el da\u00f1o producido depende de la zona de impacto sobre el enemigo.\n\nEl ritmo de los combates va de la mano con el sistema de turnos, ya que todo ir\u00e1 a un ritmo relativamente acelerado, incluso pudiendo activar en el men\u00fa de t\u00edtulo la opci\u00f3n de adelantar los movimientos de los personajes para ahorra tiempo.\n\nDado que la repetici\u00f3n de niveles, y el procedimiento de ensayo y error sobre patrones pre-existentes puede volverse sumamente tedioso, el juego se encarga de generar aleatoriamente el dise\u00f1o de cada nivel, lo cual es sin duda un gran alivio para aquellos que odien la repetici\u00f3n constante, y favorece la rejugabilidad puesto que el juego presenta un desarrollo adictivo en todos sus aspectos.\n\nA pesar de que el juego acaba cuando ya no tiene m\u00e1s que ofrecer, se hacen notables los pedidos por parte de los fans, de a\u00f1adir el modo multijugador que claramente permitir\u00eda alargar la experiencia incalculablemente y as\u00ed aumentar su valor de rejugabilidad.\n\n[h1]Conclusi\u00f3n[/h1]\n[i]Steamworld Heist[/i], como t\u00edtulo de estrategia, pero con la inclusi\u00f3n de elementos de juego de rol, resulta en una apuesta seguro para todos aquellos que gusten del g\u00e9nero. Adictivo, r\u00e1pido, equilibrado pero desafiante; una joya como pocas.\n\n[table][tr][td][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9059978][u]Seguir a Mentor P\u00edxel para m\u00e1s an\u00e1lisis y rese\u00f1as[/u][/url][/td][/tr][/table]", "timestamp_created": 1467549388, "timestamp_updated": 1499009400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.757944", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24046697": {"recommendationid": "24046697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291965780", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 991, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467739830}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u6e38\u620f\u4ece\u6765\u5f88\u5c11\u4eba\u77e5\u9053\uff0cDLC\u7684\u4eba\u7269\u548c\u88c5\u5907\u5f88\u503c\u5f97\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8346\u68d8\u62a4\u7532\u88ab\u8fd1\u8eab\u5566\u4e0d\u865a\u4eba\u7269\u6839\u672c\u9006\u5929\u52a0\u8840\u7a7f\u900f\u4f24\u5bb3\uff0c\u6b66\u5668\u4e5f\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f60\u5f97\u4e0d\u5f97\u7684\u5230\u770b\u4f60\u54af=-=\u6211\u624d\u4e0d\u4f1a\u544a\u8bc9\u4f60\u5728\u54ea\u91cc\u5f97\u5e0c\u671b\u591a\u51faDLC\u52a0\u4e00\u70b9\u65b0\u8840\u6db2\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u6211\u53ea\u80fd\u8bf4666\n\u5c31\u662f\u7b2c2\u4e2aDLC\u6ca1\u770b\u61c2\u6709\u6bdb\u752836\u5757\u8ddf\u90a3\u4e2a\u4eba\u7269DLC\u6bd4\u5c31\u662f\u6e23\u6e23\u522b\u60f3\u7740\u5751\u94b10.0", "timestamp_created": 1467548225, "timestamp_updated": 1467548406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.998001", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24043948": {"recommendationid": "24043948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009295311", "num_games_owned": 552, "num_reviews": 170, "playtime_forever": 626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470244156}, "language": "russian", "review": "8/10", "timestamp_created": 1467541527, "timestamp_updated": 1467541527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458477", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24043831": {"recommendationid": "24043831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002536777", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1062, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466170788}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0430\u044f \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f 2d \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0445\u043e\u043c \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0449\u0438\u043d\u044b.\n\u0417\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0438 \u0441 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f \u0430\u0431\u0438\u043b\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438.\n\u0423\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u0438\u044f, \u044d\u0445 \u043b\u0443\u0442-\u043b\u0443\u0442\u043e\u043a, \u0445\u044d\u0434\u0448\u043e\u0442\u044b, \u0448\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0430\u0448\u043e\u0442\u044b, \u0438\u0437-\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043a\u0430-\u0432-\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0440-\u0448\u043e\u0442\u044b -

Similar to XCOM(which I loved playing), it is an incredibly fun game to play-whilst still being challenging. \n\nPros:\n-Gameplay is very fun and engaging-also smooth\n-Controls are customizable and easy to use\n-Graphics are friendly with a cool art style\n-Sound is an amazing touch where it highlights the combat and different game mechanics of the game. The music/soundtrack is amazing!\n-Yes it is replayable-just like SteamWorld Dig\n-Due to its small filesize and requirements it is playable on most if not all computers and therefore is very accessible :D\n-Hats :D\n\nCons:\n-Infrequent FPS lag spikes, nothing major though\n-No multiplayer\n-Would be amazing if you could further customize robots\n\nIn conclusion, this is definetely one of the better games I have ever played and, without a doubt I would reccomend it to anyone-it's worth its price and its amazing gameplay. I am in full understanding of the game's small and capable and yet surely growing team but I am in full and true support of the game's progress and expansion as the SteamWorld games are one of my favourite and I would love to see what they become in the future and how many different ones do come out. -For people who loved playing games like XCOM and/or Worms then this is definitely something you should check out, buy and further support the team.              \n                                                              9/10 :)", "timestamp_created": 1467537996, "timestamp_updated": 1467542772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24038113": {"recommendationid": "24038113", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972108417", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467523376}, "language": "english", "review": "Solidly average turn based game.

[i]SteamWorld Heist[/i] lo hace combinando elementos de los cl\u00e1sicos [i]X-COM[/i] y [i]Worms[/i], jug\u00e1ndose con una campa\u00f1a bien lograda y llena de contenido.\n\n[h1]Presentaci\u00f3n[/h1]\nCon unos gr\u00e1ficos dibujados a mano, una selecci\u00f3n de colores frescos y unas animaciones bien hechas, [i]SteamWorld Heist[/i] se vende como un juego agradable a la vista. Una vez lo ejecutemos y veamos su manera de presentarse, estaremos cautivados por solo apreciar su est\u00e9tica. La m\u00fasica, aunque por sus evidentes bucles de reproducci\u00f3n infinitas, reflejan un nivel de producci\u00f3n decente que le hacen bien a la ambientaci\u00f3n steampunk de su tem\u00e1tica.\n\n[h1]Controles/Interfaz[/h1]\nEl juego nos ofrece la opci\u00f3n de jugar con el teclado o el rat\u00f3n. Con el uso del teclado sentiremos la kinestesia de [i]Worms[/i] al mover nuestras unidades de combate directamente, mientras que con el mando del rat\u00f3n tendremos la sensaci\u00f3n de estar jugando un [i]X-COM[/i] lateral, pero por si fuera poco el juego soporta el uso de control. Cualquiera que sea nuestro medio de interacci\u00f3n, estas opciones nos ofrecer\u00e1n una comodidad que se ajustar\u00e1 a nuestra preferencia.\n\nPor otro lado, la interfaz es uno de los aspectos m\u00e1s amigables del juego. Con el dise\u00f1o de su tama\u00f1o, posicionamiento y proporciones, lo hacen f\u00e1cil de adaptarse a primera vista. Aunque jugadores suspicaces pudieran tildarlo de tener marcas originarias de una consola portable por sus bordeados tan suavizados, el resultado final hace que se presente f\u00e1cilmente como un juego que pertenece a otras plataformas.\n\n[h1]Argumento[/h1]\n[i]SteamWorld Heist[/i] es el tercer juego del universo [i]SteamWorld[/i], y aunque no es una secuela de los juegos anteriores, s\u00ed est\u00e1 ambientado cientos de a\u00f1os en el futuro. En este tiempo la Tierra ha sido destruida, y los robots inteligentes a base de vapor han logrado sobrevivir y subsistir en el espacio, para ello no solo deben buscan agua y recursos, sino que deben lidiar con saqueadores y Lealistas, robots a base di\u00e9sel que abusan de su poder mediante monopolizar el espacio. Nosotros jugaremos como la capitana Piper Faraday, al mando de una tripulaci\u00f3n de contrabandistas.\n\nUno de los aspectos disonantes de su narrativa -ligada a su presentaci\u00f3n- es la apariencia de la capitana Faraday, quien a primera vista no se evidencia corresponder al sexo femenino, esto se debe no solo por su apariencia tan masculina sino por los efectos de sonidos utilizados para su tono de voz; esto, sumado a que mediante textos y di\u00e1logos recordaremos su sexo, nos generar\u00e1 una discordancia cognitiva entre lo que vemos y lo que realmente es que podr\u00eda distraernos de la inmersi\u00f3n.\n\n[h1]Jugabilidad[/h1]\nLa mejor manera de describir [i]SteamWorld Heist[/i] es partiendo del concepto de un [i]X-COM[/i] lateral, o un [i]Worms[/i] m\u00e1s t\u00e1ctico. Sin embargo quienes no tengan experiencia con estos t\u00edtulos de estrategia y carezcan de referencias, podr\u00e1n comprender sus mec\u00e1nicas si se entendiera como un juego de rol de disparos t\u00e1cticos lateral.\n\nComo es caracter\u00edstico del g\u00e9nero, estaremos a cargo de un equipo de unidades con caracter\u00edsticas \u00fanicas. Los combates est\u00e1n conformados por rondas de un turno por unidad. Estas unidades podr\u00e1n cubrirse en el entorno, atacar, utilizar habilidades y objetos. La din\u00e1mica t\u00e1ctica del juego parte de la habilidad del jugador para coordinar sus movidas y hacer un uso \u00f3ptimo de las potencialidades de sus unidades en cada uno de sus respectivos turnos.\n\nUna vez iniciemos la campa\u00f1a del juego podremos escoger entre cinco dificultades: Casual, Normal, Experimentado, Veterano y \u00c9lite. Muy apropiadamente el juego detalla los siguientes aspectos en cada dificultad: penalizaci\u00f3n por fallo de misi\u00f3n, cantidad, da\u00f1os y salud de enemigos. Cada dificultad no solo describe para qu\u00e9 audiencia de jugadores se adec\u00faa, sino que especifica c\u00f3mo recompensa cada dificultad en cuanto al otorgamiento de puntos de experiencia. Por si fuera poco, al principio de cada misi\u00f3n podemos re-determinar la dificultad a nuestro gusto. Esto no solo hace el juego amigable para quienes sean nuevos en el g\u00e9nero, sino que tambi\u00e9n ofrece un verdadero desaf\u00edo a quienes sean veteranos. \n\nComenzaremos nuestra campa\u00f1a adentrados en una misi\u00f3n que servir\u00e1 de tutorial y en la que nos asiremos de las mec\u00e1nicas esenciales del juego: movernos, cubrirnos, atacar y usar habilidades, adem\u00e1s aprenderemos que las balas rebotan, lo cual es una de las caracter\u00edsticas peculiares de este t\u00edtulo, cual le saca provecho a su naturaleza lateral.\n\nUna vez finalicemos cada misi\u00f3n, las unidades vivas ganar\u00e1n experiencia con la que subir\u00e1n de nivel, y con ello aumentar\u00e1n sus atributos y desbloquear\u00e1n habilidades. Adem\u00e1s, podremos equipar a los personajes con armas y equipamientos que modificar\u00e1n sus estad\u00edsticas. Estos objetos los obtendremos al abrir los botines que habremos recogido en el mapa de cada misi\u00f3n y compr\u00e1ndolos en tiendas con la moneda del juego: agua. En el inventario podremos acceder a los art\u00edculos, a los detalles de nuestros personajes y a la colecci\u00f3n de sombreros que hayamos recogido a lo largo del juego \u2014gui\u00f1o\u2014.\n\nNuestra manera de reclutar unidades y accediendo a otras zonas del mapa ser\u00e1 mediante canjearse su favor con el sistema de reputaci\u00f3n del que consta el juego. Este sistema no es m\u00e1s que la suma de las estrellas que se nos haya otorgado en cada misi\u00f3n, determinado por nuestra eficiencia en ellas. Y he ah\u00ed donde radica la mec\u00e1nica central del juego: el combate.\n\nCada misi\u00f3n constar\u00e1 de objetivos espec\u00edficos cuya dificultad incrementa a lo largo de la campa\u00f1a mediante la implementaci\u00f3n de mec\u00e1nicas contra-tiempo. Sin embargo es notable que una de las caracter\u00edsticas que hace del t\u00edtulo tan rejugable no es solo la versatilidad en su configuraci\u00f3n de dificultad, sino que el juego se encarga de que las misiones que rejuguemos no sean las mismas, debido a que el juego genera al azar la estructura de los mapas siempre que entremos en una misi\u00f3n.\n\n[h1]Rejugabilidad[/h1]\nUna vez terminemos la campa\u00f1a una vez, se desbloquear\u00e1 el New Game+, la cual consta de una dificultad m\u00e1s elevada e iniciaremos con nuestra colecci\u00f3n de sombreros intactas y personajes sin progreso.\n\nSin embargo, a pesar de que el t\u00edtulo ofrece una campa\u00f1a satisfactoria que invita ser rejugada y saca provecho a su generaci\u00f3n aleatoria de mapas, es lamentable que el juego con su potencial no pueda ser disfrutado mediante la interacci\u00f3n y competencia con otros jugadores por su carente funcionalidad multijugador.\n\n[h1]Conclusi\u00f3n[/h1]\nSiendo un juego de disparos t\u00e1cticos lateral, [i]SteamWorld Heist[/i] ofrece una premisa como no se ha explorado en otros t\u00edtulos, con unas mec\u00e1nicas de combate desafiantes, los aficionados al g\u00e9nero no se sentir\u00e1n de ninguna manera defraudados. Mientras tanto, los jugadores m\u00e1s casuales son invitados a ser complacidos por su sistema de selecci\u00f3n de dificultad, la cual permite establecer las condiciones de las mec\u00e1nicas de combate y hacer de la experiencia m\u00e1s un paseo que un desaf\u00edo imperdonable.\n\nEl hecho de que el juego, con su gran potencial, no soporte una modalidad multijugador puede ser causa de des\u00e1nimo para muchos, sin embargo, el t\u00edtulo ofrece una campa\u00f1a satisfactoria que no se queda corta con su sentido de progreso persistente y sus mec\u00e1nicas de rol. Es por ello [i]SteamWorld Heist[/i] se hace tan f\u00e1cil de recomendar, su versatilidad en el desaf\u00edo que ofrece no decepcionar\u00e1 a audiencias de cualquier tipo.\n\n[table][tr][td][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9059978][u]Seguir a Mentor P\u00edxel para m\u00e1s an\u00e1lisis y rese\u00f1as[/u][/url][/td][/tr][/table]", "timestamp_created": 1467504561, "timestamp_updated": 1478638755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618747", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24027033": {"recommendationid": "24027033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009569788", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467747385}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a rare gem.\nRobots, great graphics and sounds, nice variety of weapons and other tools, good enough humor and great missions.\nAnd you can even replay old missions and get loot and exp again - loving it", "timestamp_created": 1467490942, "timestamp_updated": 1467490942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539727", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24021901": {"recommendationid": "24021901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059655115", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493997126}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice!

It doesnt have any options currently for borderless fullscreen which is a slight bugaboo for me, but definitely not a deal breaker.  There is a slider in the settings that allows you to adjust the interface size which is pretty cool.  Another thing that is more of a personal annoyance for me is that there is no master volume slider in the audio settings.  \n\nThat being said I cant imagine why you would want to turn the volume down on this game.  The sounds and music are awesome!\n\nSounds: 9/10. \n\nThe music is great and fits the style of the game perfectly.  The weapon noises are actually really well down as well as some of the special effects.  If you compare it to the voice acting and epic orchestra soundtrack of a AAA game then it would be lacking, but I rated it based on how it fits for this game.  It would have earned a 10, but the garbled sounds of the robot voices gets a little hard to listen to after a while.\n\nArtwork: 9/10\n\nThe artwork is incredibly well done and detailed.  The style feels almost like it is part inspired by Matt Groening creations like The Simpsons and Futurama, and partially inspired by more gritty graphic novels like The Walking Dead.  Clearly it is difficult to explian but you can see for yourself!\n\nGameplay: 5/10\n\nThe story is pretty good, the ability to free aim your shots is definitely cool and adds some level of variety, but you will still find missions sort of blurring together after a while.  XCOM players will be familiar with this type of mission fatigue.  It is a great game, but after a while you just need a break.  \n\nI would suggest you read the dialogue though because it is well written and pretty funny at times.  \n\nYou can equip your recruited ship mates with various head covers that slightly changes their character model.  I am sure some players will find this to be neat, but I personally find it to feel unfinished and a bit of a distraction.  The head covers dont have any stat boosts as far as I can tell.  \n\nThe game has some shining moments and it just feels really fun when you play it, but it has a long way to go before it is going to be earning high scores in the gameplay section.\n\nControls: No rating here just an explanation.\n\nIf you are familiar with XCOM controls you will pick this game up super quick.  It is turn based and each turn you have the ability to use two actions per character; a move aciton and a firing action.  You can also opt to spend both of your acitons on movement, but you will not get to attack.  The games shining feature and what makes it really fun is that you get to manually aim each shot which makes for some pretty satisfying trickshots.\n\nI give it a 7/10 overall, but personally I have enjoyed it a lot and will continue to play it.", "timestamp_created": 1467411362, "timestamp_updated": 1467411576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549155", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23997123": {"recommendationid": "23997123", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983301475", "num_games_owned": 459, "num_reviews": 188, "playtime_forever": 692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474318010}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome storyline and atmosphere in the game together with plenty of addictive gameplay.\nGreat characters and enemies with great humour.\n\nWell designed and easy to use control system, with adjustable difficulty for each mission.\nTons of upgrades and items/weapons within game.\nLoads of replayability. *\n\n* \u2028Procedurally generated levels.\n\nPS:- If your a fan of hats or shooting hats off enemies , this is the game for you lol", "timestamp_created": 1467408429, "timestamp_updated": 1467418392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453136", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23976357": {"recommendationid": "23976357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207139675", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467450820}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc7ac\ubc0c\uae34 \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub108\ubb34 \uc9e7\uace0 \ud30c\ubc0d \uc694\uc18c\ub4f1\ub3c4 \uc5c6\uc5b4\uc11c \uc624\ub798\ud560 \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uc544\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1467354291, "timestamp_updated": 1467354291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23969092": {"recommendationid": "23969092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016988057", "num_games_owned": 673, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467156768}, "language": "english", "review": "Simplistic but fun.

Buy it now.  It's fun.  It's got good graphics.  The music is good and so are the sounds.  The game has a story.  It's very linear but there are \"side\" missions you can play, or ignore.  You can hire different bots to work with you and they all use slightly different weapons.  The game's been described as a mix of a turn-based metroid-vania style game and a 2D XCOM, which is fairly accurate.\n\nEach \"map\" differs from the last in some way, and almost all are randomly generated, so you can play the same mission 3 times, but the ships you're on have different layouts.  Oh, and I mentioned you can re-play missions. . .  but you don't have to.  You may want to because you can get more currency (gallons of water) and items.\n\nThe game has a decent variety of items with different rarities, but it's not too much like some games out there.  You can wear armour, or get boots that speed you up by one space.  You can carry a secondary sidearm, grenade, healing item, melee boosting item and quite a few others.\n\nEach character \"class\" differs a fair amount, and each character who shares a class with another character is not a carbon copy of them.  The two Vanguards I have don't have exactly the same abilities, nor do the two sentries that I have.  As you level up your bots, and only those who attend a mission and survive get experience, they gain new abilities.  Maybe it's extra health.  Perhaps a new skill, or an augment for an old skill.  Maybe they get faster.  Maybe they regenerate after every hit.  Maybe they get cranky when they get hit and do more damage on their next attack.  Perhaps they inspire their comerades, or can heal them.\n\nNow, gameplay.  Turn based, as I mentioned, and it's well done.  It's not too slow most of the time, unless a lot of enemies have to move and attack.  Most characters can move x spaces, or 2x spaces if they sprint and forego shooting.  Some weapons can only be used if you don't move first, but most can.  The game looks a bit like a platformer, 2D style game, but there's no jumping up.  You also have to aim your shots yourself.  Meaning you can miss - and so can the enemy.  Be careful with area effect weapons, get a bad bounce and you'll be sorry!  The enemy can also damage themselves with some weapons, and they do, at times.\n\nYou can bounce shots.  And you'll often *WANT* to bounce shots.  Most shots can be bounced off walls and cover until they strike an enemy, or until they lose energy after traveling a certain distance.  Heavier weapons, like the harpoon guns or grenade launcher type weapons, fire in an arc so you have to take that into account when firing longer distances.\n\nEvery 'bot you control has access to slightly different weapon groups.  So far all my characters have access to two weapon groups per character.  They can also use two utility items which can include other limited use weapons, and a few have weapons as special abilities as well.\n\nThere's cover, but all the cover items I've seen so far can be damaged and destroyed if it's shot often enough.  Some platforms you stand on are solid and also provide cover.  They are an indestructable form of protection from enemy fire.  There are other platforms you can walk on but they provide no cover at all.  With the cover items like barrels and barriers, along with platforms you can use as cover you can use these to your advantage - but so can the enemy.  Open doors or hatches can be fired through, and it's always satisfying to get a bounce shot to hit a target when you're firing through an open hatch and bouncing the shot off off two walls, a floor and a barrel before it hits your intended target.  Equally satisfying is when an enemy gets a bad bounce from an area effect weapon and blows himself, and his mates, to bits.  Less satisfying is when you misjudge a bounce and your area effect projectile lands at your feet.  \n\nThere is a cost of doing business.  If all your bots get blown up on a mission, you pay a reconstruction fee of several thousand gallons.  All the missions I've completed so far only require one bot to make it through to the end and I didn't notice any fees for reconstruction if I managed to complete a mission that way.  Somf of the bots you hire cost gallons, some are free.  All, so far, are worth it.\n\nOh, and a big +1 to the devs who understand that sometimes turn based games feel slow.

But Scrappers, rogue cowbots who destroy others for parts, are on the rise and terrorizing every corner of the galaxy so you decide to lend a helping hand with your crew. The story actually gets a lot more detailed within two or three missions and is really well written. So far (I haven\u2019t completed the game) I\u2019m loving following it and I feel it is one of the strong suits of the game if you follow it and read all the dialogue (if you don\u2019t it\u2019s really easy to skip it and miss what is going on). The characters and crew you meet along the way are really loveable and feel a lot more than just random soldiers or cannon fodder which comes from just how well the dialouge and small bios are written.\n\n[b]General Gameplay[/b]\nThe gameplay of SteamWorld Heist is so freaking fun. If you\u2019ve ever played XCOM and Worms you\u2019ll find it melds the gameplay style of those together perfectly making for an amazing turn-based strategy that requires a lot of skill and tactics rather than luck. \nYou start with two crew members which you can control but you\u2019ll be able to recruit more crew members as the missions go on. Each crew member has a class and their own stats and abilities which you\u2019ll be able to level up as you complete missions and earn experience. Though the abilities are predefined for each class and you cannot choose how to upgrade each crew member you can choose which crew goes onto which mission allowing you to level some members first if you prefer their skills. When you begin a mission you\u2019ll be allowed to choose your difficulty and you\u2019ll gain experience and rewards based on whichever you select, harder reaping better benefits but also having larger penalties for failure. Once you\u2019ve chosen your level and difficulty you\u2019ll be able to change your loadout choosing weapons and items for use in combat that you can equip your crew with then you\u2019re ready to battle. Weapons can be class specific or used by any class, it depends and each weapon can have different perks like added crit chance or guaranteed cripple and some weapons are rarer than others with a few not being able to be bought only found. Items can be bought at any shop and range from grenades and melee weapons to healing kits, all of which can be using during missions. \nThe gameplay is turn based and as I said before is reminiscent of XCOM. You can move a certain amount of tiles per turn and also have the option to attack (depending on the distance you moved). Your attacks can be controlled much like you can when playing worms, you just choose your direction and fire either directly at your target or using a little ricochet to help you along. Different weapons will attack differently, have different effects and do different damage so you\u2019ll be able to customize your loadout to your playstyle.\nEnemies you kill drop hats sometimes (hats are just superficial but for some reason I find myself wanting to own every single one) and you can find \u2018swag\u2019 throughout the levels which will reveal its content at the end of the level. This can range from new weapons for your crew, items to sell or moisture. You don\u2019t have to collect all the items on the level but I strongly advise it if you want your game to not get too hard as you go along because everything you find can be used or sold. Stuff you don\u2019t want can be sold for moisture meaning exploring is always the better option and you feel rewarded for not just rushing.\nEach mission you start will have one or multiple goals which you\u2019ll need to complete before advancing to the next level but you don\u2019t always have to complete them all, some are entirely optional. Some of the missions are optional also and you can ignore them if you don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s worth your time or if it\u2019s too hard meaning you\u2019re able to play the game at your own pace rather than being forced through the motions.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n--- Great easy to learn gameplay.\n--- Loveable crew members.\n--- Fantastic story with well-written dialogue\n--- Multiple genres melded well.\n--- Intuitive gameplay and interfaces.\n---Procedurally generated maps for replayability.\n--- HATS OKAY.

Meaning some shots i\u2019ve missed because the aim changes ever so slightly without warning.\n--- Can\u2019t block, defend or set up any way to protect yourself between rounds like you can in similar games.\n--- Can\u2019t compare item stats when buying them.\n\n[b]Summary[/b]\nSteamWorld Heist is one of those fantastic games that keeps you coming back for more and more every time. The unique way it combines multiple game styles to create such a perfect game is unbelievable and it\u2019s yet another game I can\u2019t recommend highly enough. The gameplay works perfectly, the story is well written and the characters are engaging. This is one of the few games out there i\u2019d say is fully deserving of it\u2019s price tag and worth every single cent.You\u2019ll find SteamWorld Heist satisfying cravings you didn\u2019t even know you had.", "timestamp_created": 1466834126, "timestamp_updated": 1466834179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768847", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23777869": {"recommendationid": "23777869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005582955", "num_games_owned": 504, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476033427}, "language": "english", "review": "SUMMARY: \nI couldn't put this down for about a week and really felt like I got my moneys worth.

And so Image & Form, the very same publisher & developer of the much beloved SteamWorld Dig, took this idea and ran with it in their newest masterpiece entitled SteamWorld Heist. It is an artistically gorgeous turn-based strategy game nestled within the steampunk universe which derives influence from several outside sources including: Xcom, Worms, and especially the TV series Firefly. But yet it manages to wrap it all together in such a creative way...one which bestows upon SteamWorld Heist a uniquely distinctive identity to call its very own as well. Because within it are to be found all kinds of zany characters, dialogue, & bosses which somehow impossibly exist...and they are so very individualistic from each other that you'll simply never bore from interacting with each.\n\nIts storyline premise is that you play as Captain Piper Faraday, the lead female protagonist within this lore who is an infamous smuggler and pirate bot, and who yet also commands a crew of mercenary bots under her direct control. Your quest is to essentially keep the rival faction Scrappers away from your territory, while commandeering their spaceships and looting them of their valuables whenever you must battle them. And interestingly, the items of value to be had here are water (ie. currency), reputation points, hats (these amusingly play a prominent role in this game as you collect them from your fallen enemies to wear upon shooting them off of their heads), plus all manner of looted items you come across to be stashed away in your inventory system. Quite honestly, it's all so very engrossing and engaging to partake in....especially with so many countless hours (15-20) of missions and objectives to complete. And also because you have full freedom to both customize and upgrade your entire crew as you see fit for any given mission, which further adds to the tactical side of things brilliantly.\n\nAnother positive attribute to mention here, is that the cornerstone of its gameplay is based primarily around skill as opposed to chance...which is undoubtedly a very commendable approach to take. Because it allows gamers to more fully connect with the experience, and thus to more fully invest themselves into its outcome in a manner that is optimally satisfying.\n\nThere is certainly no shortage of fun to be had with the gameplay either since you must well and truly strategize which approach you will be taking with your crew-mates in order to best overcome your enemies. And having the ability to manually aim each & every one of your shots with carefully thought out trick-shot-style ricochet trajectories is something which you'll never tire of doing, since countless creative possibilities can be had for any given situation. And speaking of which, the layouts for the missions are procedurally generated which ensures that no two playthroughs will ever be quite the same...thus greatly enhancing its replay value many fold.\n\nBut where this title truly shines is in its inspirational and highly polished presentation, where seemingly no short-cuts were taken in creating a truly breathtaking experience for gamers to both enjoy and immerse themselves into. The benchmark set here is quite high indeed, and its colorful and distinctive aesthetic style alone will dazzle you instantly, whereas the ingratiating and memorable old-western style soundtrack for the game (expertly done by Steam Powered Giraffe) is one which coalesces wonderfully with the light-hearted and zany atmosphere of SteamWorld Heist. It's absolutely stellar, and imbues this game with a healthy dose of flair & personality in a seemingly effortless manner. Coupled together with the high-quality sound effects to be enjoyed (such as the bullet ricochet sounds especially), there is no doubt whatsoever that it all combines to accentuate the perception of immersion within this wacky robotic world, in a way that is both pleasing and fulfilling.\n\nAnd on a side-note here, all of the robotic speech from the characters in the game is audibly unintelligible....therefore such dialogue is also presented graphically in boxes as well (which can be read of course). Admittedly this took me a bit of getting used to, but after a little while you will adapt to it. \n\nFinally, there also exists an additional content DLC which can be purchased separately (SteamWorld Heist: The Outsider), if you're gunning to add new hats, weapons, and missions to the game.\n\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nI have to come right out and say that this was a blast and a real treat to play! And as much as I carefully looked for them, there just weren't any obvious deficiencies to be found here with this new release, because virtually every single facet of it is so admirably executed. You can readily tell that its developers are a very experienced team of professionals who invested a whole lot of time & effort into making this a must-own title for fans of the genre. In fact, I'm not even a hard-core turn-based gamer by any stretch of the imagination, yet even I found myself smiling with satisfaction for much of the experience...especially since it exudes such light-hearted fun & artistic creativity as gift-wrapping for its rock-solid gameplay...with no obvious nor major short-comings to be found whatsoever. \n\nThus I would readily recommend this gem as a very worthy addition to your library, especially so if such games interest you in any way at all to begin with. And I'm always delighted to review games where that extra amount of care & attention to detail were placed into them...ensuring that they will be purchased with no regrets by those of us who adore stepping inside of such fantastical futuristic worlds which also pay homage to the past...ones where we can command a crew of whimsical bots while proudly wearing the most outlandish assortment of hats you'll ever find.\n\nI'll enthusiastically rate this one a very solid 4.5 out of 5 stars\n\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n\n- Strategtic skill-based gameplay along with several difficulty levels for both beginners and veterans alike \n- Light-hearted and whimsical humor\n- Fantastic sound-track & audio effects\n- Over 100 different weapons and almost 100 hats to collect\n- Impressively artistic aesthetics\n- Countless hours of missions plus bosses to battle\n- Full controller support\n- Plenty of game options to adjust\n- Non-buggy & plays very optimized\n- Steam achievements + trading cards\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n\n- Not a particularly big fan of the indecipherable robotic speech effect (this is a relatively minor quibble though)\n\n\nFor similar reviews and great giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com", "timestamp_created": 1466522336, "timestamp_updated": 1466530399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509255", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23685397": {"recommendationid": "23685397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113354508", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466514589}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10 would wear it on my head.\n\nThe atmosphere and music is fantastic and the gameplay is challenging without being unfair.

Play with a controler, if you do not, the game is a lot more complicated and far strenous than it is with the controller. Played over steam link and directly at a desktop, controls are intuitive and do not require any changes. \n\nSo, what can I say about this gem of a game: for me it brings back the old days, the really old days. Intuitive gameplay, skills, story development, treasure and the urge to get all missions done with all stars.\nYou might need more tries, but the game rewards you for every ounce of time you invest. \"Why grab all those tiny treasures, only the legendary ones are interesting?\" A big NO! Items are well spread within a mission, to get them all is really a hassle some times, but this is the fun part. \n\nThe mission gameplay is the same - a shoot to kill, loot and thrill - but the setting and  circumstances of all missions are changing. They make you rush, think twice about movement, and once you retry a mission, you sometimes want to change the weapons loadout or the steambot. Now the tiny, useless grenade becomes a mighty tool, the 'I hit a brontosaur - but with only one of four shells' grenade launcher is perfectly that what you need. Sometimes you have a perfect heist, sometimes you are happy to evacuate before the next wave arrives. Epic treasure, I will get you later. Rewards for stars are also part of the general progress. You want them, you crave for them.\n\nEvery single steambot, despite some having the same \"class\", has his/her/its own flair, gamestyle, weapon-set and skill-tree that makes every single one a tool, an asset, a rusty old friend you do not wanna see go down. And if one, two, three or the whole barding party went down, you cry tears of H2O (you loose currency). \n\nThe onboard dialoges are well written, rejuvenate from time to time. You can grind, you can go casual, you might say \"just one or two games\" - and there you are fighting evildoers all the time - and three hours are gone by.\n\nTo steam up: get it. Enjoy it. Enjoy it again. If you like it, get the DLC. Pretty fun, merges well, a \"good\" dlc. More than the  average \u20ac/hour fun ratio !!! Despite the BOOMS, this is still no brutal game =3\n\nOh my, I forgot the hats. Beautiful hats!

Steamworld Heist conjures up a lot of fond memories for a Firefly fan, it wears it's influence proudly, and there are obvious analogues, the main character Piper Faraday is the captain of a small smuggling vessel, the villainous Scrappers who are pieced together from parts of dead robots are this verse's Reaver counterpart, and Royalists being the obvious stand in for the Alliance. The game permeates a Firefly vibe, but it's all got enough of it's own identity that it is far more than just trying to be Firefly: The Game and is very much it's own space western, there's some obvious love for the Western genre as characters will spout references to movies like The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. The music is also terrific, and I'd be remiss not to mention it, seeing as the band Steam Powered Giraffe who provided the soundtrack were an initial draw for me, and right from the title theme you can tell why their talents were sought.\n\nGameplay wise, it's been touted by many as XCom meets Worms, that's a fairly succinct way of putting it but I really don't like this trend of comparing nearly every turn-based strategy game to XCom, that's fairly reductive and the differences are more than apparent. But that aside, the gameplay is indeed extremely competent turn-based strategy, and landing some critical shots with bullet ricochet can be incredibly satisfying, or for that matter firing a grenade that bounces with a metalic ping before hitting it's mark doesn't seem to lose it's spark. You'll have many different crewmembers being recruited for you to take on various missions, each with their own particular traits and abilities, as well as unique personalities. It's a hell of a lot of fun.\n\nWell recommended if you like turn-based gameplay, and if you are a fan of Firefly, this'll be right up your alley.", "timestamp_created": 1465918597, "timestamp_updated": 1465918597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23552855": {"recommendationid": "23552855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118411383", "num_games_owned": 397, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1527, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469003389}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u7b80\u5355\u4e0a\u624b\uff0c\u82f1\u6587\u770b\u4e0d\u61c2\u4e5f\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u73a9\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u5f88\u6709\u4e50\u8da3\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd8\u4f1a\u591a\u7ed950%\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u6253\u6298\u65f6\u975e\u5e38\u503c\u5f97\u5165\u624b\u3002\n\n\n\u6bcf\u6b21\u90fd\u8981\u628a\u5e3d\u5b50\u6361\u56de\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u662f\u5f3a\u8feb\u75c7\u5417\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1465915033, "timestamp_updated": 1465915033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23552225": {"recommendationid": "23552225", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007993736", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1083, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466849858}, "language": "english", "review": "Just start playing.\nAmazing visual and audio (music in bar is superb).\nFor now it looks like fancy style turn based tactic.

I wholeheartedly recommend it. It's like the developers took X-Com's combat system and made it 2D.\n\nPros:\n-The Combat System\n SteamWorld Heist was able to take everything good about X-com's combat system and make it 2D. It also made some tweaks that I like more than X-com. One example is that shots are not based off of dice rolls. What that means is that when I line up a shot, it will hit whatever I'm aiming at. If you line up the shot correctly, you can shoot enemies that are behind cover.\n\n-The Art Design\nThe game looks amazing. The robots are detailed and cool looking. Space looks awesome and colorful. My favorite part has to be that you can collect a bunch of different hats for your characters to wear.\n\n-The Soundtrack\nThe music is really good. It's well composed and it fits the space western theme that the game is going for. I really wish that it was available to purchase.\n\n-Boss Fights\nI was honestly surprised when I came across the first boss. The games that I have played similar to SteamWorld Heist did not have what I would call bosses. The bosses that I have fought each have had special abilities and multiple phases.\n\nCons:\n-The Story\nLet's get this out of the way first, I'm NOT saying that the story is bad. What I'm saying is that the story is the weakest part of the game. The beginning, middle, and end of the game felt really disconnected to me. I can't go into more detail without spoiling the plot, but know going in that it's not the best.\n\n-Lack of Mission Variety\nMy biggest problem with the game is that a lot of the missions feel the same. Most of the time it's go in, kill bad guys, collect loot, escape. The game adds things like doors that won't open until you destroy a generator, but it never feels any different. I can't tell you which mission would be my favorite (excluding boss fights) because they all feel so similar. This is somewhat solved with The Outsider DLC, but that felt more like a bandage instead of a fix.\n\nThere you have it. Like I said earlier, I recommend SteamWorld Heist. The Cons section is a bit nitpicky because there is honestly not a lot wrong with the game. \n\nI hope this review was helpful to you,\nD2\n", "timestamp_created": 1465777435, "timestamp_updated": 1465777435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23529219": {"recommendationid": "23529219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075521762", "num_games_owned": 432, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 762, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488016139}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0427\u0442\u043e \u044f \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0431 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435?\n\u041f\u043b\u044e\u0441\u044b:\n1. \u041c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430-\u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f\n2. \u042e\u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043a-\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f\n3. \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0438-\u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0435 (\u041c\u043e\u0440\u044f\u043a,\u0424\u0435\u043d \u0438 \u0411\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438-\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 <3 )\n4. \u0428\u0410\u041f\u041a\u0418!\n5. \u041e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u044f - \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0435,\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043e \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0438\u0437\u044e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0439\n\u041c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441\u044b:\n1. \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430-\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430 :\u0441\n\n\u0418\u0422\u041e\u0413: \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442.", "timestamp_created": 1465776479, "timestamp_updated": 1465776479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486236", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23528918": {"recommendationid": "23528918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019645318", "num_games_owned": 401, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482021521}, "language": "german", "review": "The only drawback on this one is - and i guess this applies to most of the brilliant games you can't take your hands off until you've finished them - that it's too short. don't get me wrong, you definitely get enough game for your money - that's not the point. but once you've finished the last mission you can't believe it's over cause you just want to go on and even during the time you're playing you just don't want to play anything else. good thing there's also an expansion out which i'm gonna check out next.\ni usually don't like turn base games. i tried to like jagged alliance and comparable titles. i didn't. they just felt a bit... stiff. but steamworld heist takes turn based combat to a fresh, enjoyable, new level. it just feels smooth. i've played most of the heroes of m&m franchise but always got bored halfway through.\nin steamworld heist however you have a very rewarding (not too overloaded and complicated - rather basic) level up and inventory system which gives you enough motivation to go on.\ntoo bad all the actually loveable characters you can hire to complete your crew are mere trophies cause i for my part sticked to the ones i got first and leveled them up, so actually there's no need for additional members.\nthe style/artwork is great, the game is more than solid and has a very nice flow going on.\ndon't miss out on this little gem:)", "timestamp_created": 1465774447, "timestamp_updated": 1465774447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23528464": {"recommendationid": "23528464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004767061", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466371424}, "language": "english", "review": "Just WOW!

Ich hab mich jetzt schon 1-2 mal dabei ertappt, wie ich einfach nur in einer Bar (im Spiel) stehe und der Musik zuh\u00f6re... Die ist echt Klasse! Alles wirkt perfekt zusammen zu einer super Atmosph\u00e4re. Wer die Musik von \"Flame in the Flood\" mochte, wird diese ebenfalls m\u00f6gen. Klare Kaufempfehlung! Die 20\u20ac sind super angelegt und halten auch das was versprochen wird.\n\n\n[b] Pro: [/b]\n+ Sch\u00f6ner Grafikstil (es wechseln sich verschiedene Umgebungsstile ab, da man durch verschiedene Universen reist und jedes dieser Universen hat einen anderen Look; Grade wenn man denkt, dass der Look langsam nervt, kommt man in ein anderes Universum)\n+ Herausfordernd (Es ist wie XCOM in 2D und das ist NICHT schlecht! Ich liebe XCOM und ich liebe dieses Spiel. Man muss abw\u00e4gen, welche Charaktere man mit nimmt, welche Items und welche Waffen. Super!)\n+ Angenehme Atmosph\u00e4re (Das Spiel hat eine sch\u00f6ne und angenehme Atmosph\u00e4re, ich kann nicht genau beschreiben wieso, aber es ist einfach nur sch\u00f6n dieses Spiel zu spielen)\n+ Motivierende Missionen/ Niedriger Frustfaktor (Ich spiele auf Schwierigkeit \"Normal\" und bin selten gefrustet. Nat\u00fcrlich verliere ich den ein oder anderen Einsatz, aber ich f\u00fchle mich immer so, als w\u00fcrde ich diese Mission wieder machen wollen. [b]\"Jetzt erst recht!\"[/b] ist da das Motto.)\n+ Musik (Wer die Musik bei \"Flame in the Flood\" mochte, wird diese Lieben! Countrymusik im Hintergrund, sch\u00f6n untermalend, welche flie\u00dfend wechselt wenn man die Locations wechselt. Wunderbar \u2665)\n+ Keine Ladezeiten (Ja! Klingt komisch, ist aber so. Alles wechselt flie\u00dfen, also Location zu Location und das ohne Ladezeiten. Toll!)\n+ Charaktere (Ich habe bis jetzt [i](Knapp 6 Std. gespielt)[/i] schon 9 verschiedene Charaktere in meinem Team. Alle haben andere Skills, Waffenf\u00e4higkeiten und sehen KOMPLETT unterschiedlich aus. Von den Gegnern ganz zu schweigen. Es gibt so viele Charaktere, das ist einfach nur sch\u00f6n! Man hat immer was f\u00fcr das Auge)\n+ Entschleunigtes Spiel, trotzdem knackiges Gameplay (Es ist ein ruhiges Spiel, Taktikshooter eben. Trotzdem ist es knackig und man muss h\u00e4ufiger auch mal nachdenken. [i] Laufe ich nach rechts und schie\u00dfe mit dem Granatwerfer, der Splash-Damage macht und evtl. meine Leute trifft oder schie\u00dfe ich von hinten mit dem Sniper und kille nur einen?!\"[/i] So in etwa ist es meist. Man nimmt sich Zeit, muss kurz \u00fcberlegen, aber es ist nie langweilig langsam!)\n+ Viele Eastereggs/ Liebe zum Detail (Ich habe bis jetzt 3 Andeutungen auf \"Zur\u00fcck in die Zukunft\" gefunden. Jedes Item hat einen eigene Beschreibung. SO VIEL LIEBE ZUM DETAIL IST SUPER!)\n+ H\u00dcTE\n+ \"Stimmausgabe\" (Jeder Roboter macht andere T\u00f6ne, da es keine richtige Sprachausgabe gibt. Das ist echt cool gemacht!)\n\n[b] Neutral: [/b]\n-/+ Repetetive Missionen (Es sind h\u00e4ufig die gleichen Missionen, aber die Jagd nach besseren Waffen, mehr Wasser und Geld treibt einen an, die Missionen auch nochmal und nochmal zu spielen, bis man \u00fcberall 3* hat.)\n-/+ Manchmal \"doofe\" KI (Manchmal macht die KI auf der Schwierigkeit \"Normal\" schon komische Sachen, aber manchmal trifft sie mit 4 Abprallern den Kopf. F\u00fchlt sich manchmal etwas unfair an, erinnert mich aber immer wieder daran: MAN SUCH DIR DEKUNG VERDAMMT)\n-/+ Man kann die Missionen \u00f6fter hintereinander machen. (Ja... Das ist so eine Sache. Na klar, wenn ich meinen Rang von 1* auf 4* aufbessern will, ist das super, aber wenn ich schon die Volle Punktzahl hab, dann kann ich da immer und immer wieder rein um Geld (Wasser) zu sammeln... Machs selbst auch, deshalb find ich es nicht schlimm, aber irgendwie st\u00f6rt es mich dann nach dem 10ten Run schon etwas.)\n\n[b] Contra: [/b]\n[i] Wow, du liest echt immernoch?! Krass.. :D[/i]\n- KI (Ja grade hab ich es schon bei Neutral angesprochen, aber manchmal ist die KI echt unfair. Trotzdem ist dieser Punkt nicht ganz neutral und nicht ganz negativ, irgendwas dazwischen halt.)\n- So kleines Inventar (Ja das ist jetzt Erbsenz\u00e4hlerei, aber manchmal nervt es schon, dass da nix mehr reinpasst in das Inventar, aber andersherum muss man dann halt den Platz managen den man hat. Was auch nicht schlimm ist.)\n\n[b] Fazit: [/b]\nDie Positiven Dinge \u00fcberwiegen ganz klar. Das Spiel ist super gelungen und macht mir echt Spa\u00df und gute Laune.

This steampunk space adventure focuses on skill rather than chance, and is jam-packed with bullet-bouncing, turret weaving, robot commanding fun.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n[u][b]SteamWorld\u2019s Narrative[/b][/u]\nFollowing the events of a shattered planet, Cowbots farm leftover land for moisture and water. These resources are a precious commodity used by all bots, excluding the diesel-driven Royalists. With a new danger lurking in the depths of space, gentlebots have so much to worry about. Not wanting undue attention from the Royal Space Force, Piper Faraday, notorious smuggler and occasional pirate, leads a crew of seemingly misfit mercenaries on a quest to drive the bad-for-business Scrappers gang away from her domain. Little does she know what the universe has in mind for her and her crew.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n[u][b]Starting the Adventure[/b][/u]\nPiper\u2019s journey begins upon selecting one of three available game slots, then choosing a preferred difficulty level. These difficulties are listed as: Casual < Regular < Experienced < Veteran < Elite. Each tier provides various changes to: enemy damage, enemy quantity, mission failure punishment and bonus XP earned. SteamWorld Heist\u2019s gaming structure is comprised of missions (primary and side/challenge missions) that must be unlocked with a reputation requirement (stars). Losing or aborting a mission will result in a loss of water (currency) at any difficulty level above Casual.\n\n[u][b]Missions & Loot[/b][/u]\nEvery mission rewards the player with reputation which is used to proceed further into the game and unlock additional characters/weapons. Most missions are scored on a 3-star rating system; however, there will be missions that score differently. On each mission, various opportunities are presented to obtain loot in the form of loot bags, epic loot (chests), or hats. Perfecting a mission requires completing the objectives (clear the ship, defeat X, destroy X, retrieve all loot etc.) without having any casualties and retrieving the epic loot(s). Before beginning any mission, a loadout screen is presented where the player will choose the participating characters and their equipment. Due to a crew limitation on missions, it is advised to change up which characters go on each mission regularly to keep levels relatively even; however, this is definitely not required. \n\nEach mission environment is procedurally generated, providing a unique experience for every player. Heist never feels repetitive because of this, along with the fact that random missions will have a theme (turret factory, explosive carrier etc.). Boss fights also introduce eccentric characters with unique abilities. If that\u2019s not enough, alarms that trigger infinitely spawning enemies/turrets or countdown timers with difficult consequences may be included. \n\n[u][b]Combat[/b][/u]\nHeist\u2019s combat utilizes a turn-based strategy system with a unique mechanic where the weapons are manually aimed and shot by the player. This removes a chance or hit % mechanic that many other similar turn-based strategy games use, and promotes skill-shots or ricocheting around objects to reach the target(s). The entire crew will individually perform their turns before the enemy performs theirs. Each turn is comprised of a movement phase, and a sprint/action phase.\n\n[b]Movement & Sprint Phase[/b]\nPositioning is crucial in successfully attaining reputation. Each mission is littered with destructible barrels and walls for partial cover; however utilizing complete cover will be necessary at times. Typically averaging about 6 move spaces per turn, characters can move further using a sprint mechanic. Although it is not split into discrete phases, transitioning from the movement phase into the sprint phase is marked with a differently colored marker or floor space. If the player moves a character into a space beyond the movement range and requires sprinting, no further action can be made by that character. Sprinting is useful for running to partial cover, hiding from turrets, or eluding spawning enemies.\n\n[b]Action Phase[/b]\nIf the player chooses to keep a character within their movement range, that character can perform an action. An action would either constitute firing that character\u2019s weapon after aiming it, using a special utility item\u2019s free action, or performing a melee attack if an enemy is adjacent to the prioritized character. There are many different weapon types in Heist, and some weapons have specific requirements for use, such as a particular sniper rifle\u2019s \u201cmove or shoot \u2013 pick one\u201d specification. A rarity and tiered weapon system also promotes loot-based progression. Rare weapons will generally have higher base damage/critical damage stats, or attachments equipped (laser sight). \n\nAiming provides the primary game mechanic that sets Heist apart from other turn-based strategy games. If the player chooses to fire a weapon, it must be manually aimed to deal efficient damage. Depending on the weapon attachment or gun type, the projectiles may travel in an arc, bounce multiple times with or without subsequent damage reduction per bounce, travel in a straight line, or scatter. The characters have the ability to shoot directly straight above or below, 90 degrees from the horizontal; however, each character breathes, adding another level of skill required to hit the target(s).\n\n[u][b]Character Progression[/b][/u]\nEach character utilized in a mission gains XP after successful completion of that mission. At each level up, a passive ability will be gained. Some characters have unique abilities, while others gain more stats. A couple unique abilities that are very crucial in deciding team composition include:\n\n[list]\n[*]Kill Shot: upon delivering a fatal shot, the character gets one additional shot\n[*]Inspire: Increase adjacent allies\u2019 damage by +1, along with your own if Inspired\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Presentation[/h1]\n[u][b]Art[/b][/u]\nEven though Heist is a steampunk world, it is very colorful and glossy. The artwork is extremely well polished, providing a truly immersive role-play. As opposed to using the traditional rustic, dull or textured color palettes seen in many steampunk artwork, bright blues, pinks and greens are employed. The settings used for the ships can also vary from oil-crusted rigs to royal and elegant cruisers. The pit stops/bars/social hubs in Heist are very active, filled with neon signs and questionable characters.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[u][b]Current State of the Game[/b][/u]\nSteamWorld Heist was just recently released on Steam (Dec. 10th 2015 for the PS4, 3DS, Vita, WiiU and Xbox One versions). The developers have shown active and continued interest in Heist, as can be seen in the Steam Discussions board. With a desire to receive input on support and feature requests, SteamWorld\u2019s popularity is still growing.\n\n[b]Advised Suggestions[/b]\nAlthough Heist is in a near perfected iteration of its development cycle, there are a couple suggestions that would improve gameplay; these are listed below.\n\n[list]\n[*]Allow loadout changes from the \u201cStart\u201d button menu, or upon item acquisition instead of [i]only[/i] at mission startup\n[*]Mark what difficulty a mission was beaten in to aid with achievement tracking\n[/list]\n\n[u][b]Verdict[/b][/u]\nWith everything taken into consideration, SteamWorld Heist is definitely recommended to any fan of strategy games, especially turn-based ones. Kind to newcomers or veterans alike, there isn\u2019t much left to be desired from Heist. It truly deserves to be a contender for 2016's indie game of the year.\n\n[table][tr][td]Review copy provided by Image & Form[/td][/tr][/table]", "timestamp_created": 1465690544, "timestamp_updated": 1470602761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23510855": {"recommendationid": "23510855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041969171", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498693288}, "language": "english", "review": "like steam world dig but more fun and charming also has steam powered giraffe playing the music so nuff said, GET IT!", "timestamp_created": 1465686579, "timestamp_updated": 1465686579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23509912": {"recommendationid": "23509912", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969363929", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513907048}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome. \nVery pretty, fitting sound track, feels very polished and deliberate.

In more than one instance did I have to go back and play a level 4x so I could get all rating stars. \nPersonally I love having a challenge in such a game. Due to the lack of a (basically) infinite supply of soldiers like in XCom, even if your Steambots die during a run, they are revived as soon as you make it back to the ship (or abort the mission/fail) and just lose the EXP they would've gained. Maybe it's just me, but I'd love to see something like an \"insane mode\", where your steambots stay dead. But again, I just love frustration. \nGreat game though!

Les tirs-ricochets (si l'on dispose de l'aptitude n\u00e9cessaire et d'une arme \u00e0 vis\u00e9e) sont \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s fun (rappelez-vous Alien IV).\nCerise sur l'assurance, il y a des Boss.

This time on the PC. And I am happy to report that this HD version is exactly how SteamWorld Heist is on the 3DS, only it looks a hell of a lot better. As it should!\n\nNow then, the game itself. A turn based, \"2D\"esque game that has movement and cover mechanics much like one finds in XCOM. You can walk a certain distance, take cover, and then shoot. Depending on your weapon, for some weapons do not allow you to shoot after moving. In any case, you can also sprint and take cover, but that automatically takes away your ability to shoot. Much like in XCOM with certain soldier classes. Heist could also be described as inspired by Worms, just like the developers themselves state on the Steam store page. Certain things like grenades and rockets for example have a curved trajectory, much like in Worms games.\n\nPlot of the game more or less picks up an unknown time after the events of SteamWorld Dig. It is not directly mentioned, but what you will find at the end of SteamWorld Dig is quite heavily tied to the plot of Heist as well. In any case, the steambots have taken off to space. They most likely took off to space before the Steamworld itself (aka, Earth) exploded, but now they are forced to stay in space. Farming moisture on the chunks of Steamworld that still orbit the planets core. They also share the space with another \"race\" of automatons, called the Royalists. Who are not steam driven automatons, but diesel driven. So you get this fantastic mixture of Steampunk and Dieselpunk in the first and second parts of the game.\n\nYou, dear player, play as the rogue captain Piper. And it is your task to gather a crew of steam driven (and if you also purchased the Outsider DLC, one of them is actually something else) automatons, Cowbots if you prefer, to help you bring a bit more freedom to the Outskirts. During the course of your travels, adventures and shooting, you will also find yourself suddenly involved in a devious plot that has more or less everything to do with why the planet went kaput and what was unleashed back then. In the end, it is your task to put an end to all of that nonsense so that honest and hard working Cowbots will have it a bit easier on the Outskirts.\n\nThe Soundtrack of the game is also rather splendid. It was made by the band Steam Powered Giraffe, who some of you might also know as being the ones behind Montana's theme song in Gearbox Softwares latest game, Battleborn. They themselves are steam driven automatons, so it was only fitting that they would make the soundtrack for this game. They also have ingame cameos, and not only can you hear their songs in the variety of space bars you will visit in SteamWorld Heist, but at times you can actually see them perform in said bars.\n\nSo. A TL;DR conclusion: A turn based strategy game with steamdriven automatons as the characters. Influenced by XCOM and Worms games. Gather a rag-tag crew from space bars, listen to lovely music while you are at it, and then go shoot some robots why won't you.\n\nOh and there are also hats. So many hats. Even more in the DLC. Speaking of which, I actually think I am still missing at least 3 hats from the 3DS version.", "timestamp_created": 1465315830, "timestamp_updated": 1465315830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.730220", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23435996": {"recommendationid": "23435996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043250032", "num_games_owned": 1265, "num_reviews": 155, "playtime_forever": 582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483466309}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]A game of hats and heists. [/h1]\n\nThe third game in the SteamWorld universe, SteamWorld Heist is a squad-based strategy game all about, you guessed it, heists. In SWH, you\u2019re in command of a group of pirates who are in turn commanded by Captain Piper. After the Earth is almost completely destroyed, its robot inhabitants are forced to head into space. Despite being a crew of pirates, the objectives in the game are actually focused on helping the common folk rather than taking from them as you might expect. This involves boarding enemy ships and completing one of several possible main objectives.\n\nMost of your time in SWH will be spent breaking into other ships and then dealing with the objectives for that given ship. Most of the ships are just levels you need to complete to get to levels which actually advance the story, for the most part the main objective on these kinds of levels is to collect a certain amount of SWAG (the name for loot in the game). Story levels have different objectives based on how the ship\u2019s role in the story. For example, if the ship has some kind of special item it\u2019ll probably be stored in a locked vault so you\u2019ll have to take out the ship\u2019s generators to open the vault.\n\nFor some ships, completing your objective is fairly straightforward, you\u2019ll meet some stiff resistance but once they\u2019re dead, they\u2019re dead. However, a fair amount of the ships in the game have alarm systems. Depending on how big the ship is, you\u2019ll have a certain number of turns before the first tier of the alarm goes off. Generally, the first tier deploys the ship\u2019s turrets but if there aren\u2019t any turret positions one or two enemies will be deployed every other turn. The alarm then resets and starts counting down to tier two and then after two it moves on to three. The higher tiers mean you\u2019ll either get a group of three enemies or a \u2018special\u2019 enemy who\u2019s more challenging than your average foot soldier. From my experience, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to complete your objective on a ship with an alarm without reaching the first tier, I found this quite frustrating at first but the idea has grown on me. The game needs that extra layer of challenge for it to remain, for lack of a better word, challenging. If every ship has a static number of enemies then they\u2019d all be far too easy and while the non-alarmed ships definitely have a place in the game, I found the alarmed ships to be more enjoyable because they made me think more carefully about what I was doing and ultimately I was better at the game when playing those levels.\n\nSWH\u2019s gameplay is focused around the aiming mechanic. Instead of an RNG-based system like you see in most squad-based strategy games (XCOM and the like) your ability to hit your opponents is based entirely on your own skill. Some weapons (scoped pistols and sniper rifles) have a laser sight which helps you plan your shot (though the aiming with this isn\u2019t completely steady so there\u2019s still some challenge with timing the shot) but all other weapons require you to \u2018eye-ball\u2019 it. Early on in the game you\u2019ll probably be sticking to fairly safe shots but it is possible to use ricochet to hit enemies you can\u2019t directly aim at and this becomes easier to pull off the more experienced you are with the aiming in the game. Hitting your target with a crazy shot that bounces several times is incredibly satisfying.\n\nSpeaking of weapons, there are quite a lot of them, ranging from basic revolvers all the way up to rocket launchers. All weapons have a damage stat and a critical hit stat (how much extra damage you do when you get a critical hit) and some weapons have other stats too, such as \u201ccan\u2019t shoot after moving\u201d (sniper rifle and \u201cfriendly fire\u201d (grenade/rocket launchers). \n\nNot all Steambots are created equally, they can\u2019t use whatever weapon they want. Every Steambot has a class, for example there\u2019s the \u2018Brawler\u2019 class which can only use Handguns (but deals higher melee damage) and there\u2019s a \u2018Vanguard\u2019 class which can use handguns or assault weapons (SMGs and shotguns). As with all squad-based strategy games, finding a good combination of classes to use is key. Most missions allow a squad of three crew members (though I\u2019ve also seen one, two and four crew missions) so it\u2019s usually wise to have a close-range, mid-range and long-range fighter. Different classes also have different abilities which are unlocked when you gain enough experience to level up. Sometimes when you level up you\u2019ll unlock something fairly basic like +1 health but the abilities you do get are incredibly useful (as is a health increase to be fair). Some of these abilities are passive, such as steadier aim for the Sentry class if you haven\u2019t moved that turn, while others are active such as Double Shot for the Vanguard class which is self-explanatory.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, every ship has \u2018SWAG\u2019 (loot) for you to find. Generally, loot is found in the form of loot bags but every level also has an Epic SWAG box. These boxes usually contain special loot and they also grant you a reputation point for that level (you get three in total, two for completing without any deaths and one for the Epic SWAG). Reputation points are used to unlock new areas of the map but some characters who can be hired as crew members require you to have a certain amount of reputation to prove to them that you\u2019re worth fighting for. Most loot bags contain water (the game\u2019s currency) but you\u2019ll also find weapons and equipment and the occasional Earth relic which can be sold for a substantial amount of water. Equipment ranges from grenades to health kits and even armour (as well as other things) and each crew member has two equipment slots.\n\nYour inventory space is fairly limited (though you can buy and occasionally find upgrades for your inventory space) so you\u2019ll quite often have to sell off items to make space for new ones. The only items that don\u2019t require inventory space are your hats. Hats are basically SWH\u2019s version of collectibles and there are three ways to obtain them. First, all crew members have their own default hat so hiring a new crew member will get you one new hat. Secondly, you can shoot an enemy\u2019s hat off (they can do the same to you) and then go and pick it up, adding it to your collection. Lastly, there are hat shops in the game where you can buy new hats from (there are also shops for equipment and weapons). While they don\u2019t alter any of your stats, they are a nice little customisation option.\n\nA couple more things to mention. SWH\u2019s focus is definitely on gameplay rather than story but the story is pretty entertaining and there\u2019s a good bit of humour in there. All of the game\u2019s sound effects are great and the soundtrack is also very good. It does feel more natural playing with a controller and I enjoyed it more but it is definitely playable with KB&M.\n\n[h1]Verdict [/h1]\n\nSWH is an excellent squad-based strategy game with challenging and engaging gameplay and plenty of content. Oh and cool hats! Lots of cool hats. Whether you\u2019re here because you played the previous game or you\u2019re just a fan of strategy games, this one is well worth picking up.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/lonerangerreviews#curation]Lone Ranger Reviews.[/url][/i]\n\nEl K.", "timestamp_created": 1465310675, "timestamp_updated": 1465319848, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 126, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.812679", "comment_count": "12", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23434970": {"recommendationid": "23434970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062408517", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514292720}, "language": "english", "review": "Firefly with robots and hats.

Though the game penalizes you by halving your water supply, purchasing anything with water is not essential to progress.\n", "timestamp_created": 1516748757, "timestamp_updated": 1516748757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39556642": {"recommendationid": "39556642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198369071167", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1535, "last_played": 1516871758}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u901a\u5173\n\u6e38\u620f\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u5404\u79cd\u9053\u5177\u6b66\u5668\u89d2\u8272\u6280\u80fd\u642d\u914d\u8ba9\u6218\u6597\u80fd\u53d8\u5f97\u5341\u5206\u591a\u6837\u5316\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u5404\u79cd\u5e3d\u5b50\u80fd\u62ff\uff0c\u5173\u5361\u901a\u4e0d\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fee\u6539\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u6309\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u6700\u4f4e\u96be\u5ea6\u7ed9\u6210\u5c31\uff0c\u597d\u4e0d\u5bb9\u6613\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u901a\u5173\u8fd8\u662f\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u4f11\u95f2\uff0c\u54ce\n\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u4e0b\u6765\u5bf9\u89d2\u8272\u6709\u4e86\u70b9\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u8bf4\u4e00\u4e0b\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6bd4\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5427\n1.\u961f\u957f\u6d3e\u5e15\u6cd5\u62c9\u7b2c \u65e2\u80fd\u7fa4\u4f53\u52a0\u653b\u53c8\u80fd\u56de\u8840\uff0c\u8f85\u52a9\u5f88\u5f3a 2.dlc\u4eba\u7269fen \u5438\u8840\u52a0\u6fc0\u5149\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u98ce\u7b5d 3.\u8d4f\u91d1\u730e\u4eba\u8428\u8389 \u51fb\u6740\u76ee\u6807\u540e\u53ef\u4ee5\u518d\u6b21\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u6e05\u5c0f\u5175\u80fd\u529b\u5f88\u5f3a 4.\u54d1\u94c3\u7537\u4f0a\u4e07\u65af\u57fa\u6216\u8005\u662f\u5047\u817f\u897f\u5e03\u62c9\u65af \u4e24\u4f4d\u90fd\u662f\u8840\u725b\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fdd\u62a4\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f93\u51fa\u597d\u70b9\uff0c\u770b\u7740\u5e26\u5427 5.\u9c7c\u4eba\u6bd4\u5229 \u8fd1\u6218\u8089\u640f\u80fd\u529b\u5168\u89d2\u8272\u6700\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u9664\u4e86\u8089\u640f\u6ca1\u5565\u7279\u8272\uff0c\u770b\u4f60\u600e\u4e48\u7528\u4e86 \n\u5927\u4f53\u597d\u7528\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u5c31\u8fd9\u4e9b\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u9664\u4e86BOSS\u65f6\u7684\u795e\u5668\u58eb\u5175\u6bd4\u963f\u7279\u91cc\u514b\u65af\u4ee5\u5916\u90fd\u5f88\u4e00\u822c\u822c\uff0c\u6216\u8bb8\u662f\u6211\u8fd8\u73a9\u7684\u4e0d\u591f\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4ed6\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u6709\u610f\u89c1\u53ef\u4ee5\u804a\u804a", "timestamp_created": 1516714087, "timestamp_updated": 1516714087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39552829": {"recommendationid": "39552829", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132720565", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 897, "last_played": 1516668475}, "language": "italian", "review": "Divertentissimo strategico a turni.

Este juego mezcla un estilo de juego con combates t\u00e1cticos por cu\u00e1dricula con coberturas a lo XCOM, pero en 2D, y como no ambientado en el universo de SteamWorld.[/b]\n\n\n[h1]HISTORIA[/h1]\n\nDe primeras controlamos a la Capitana Piper Faraday, y debemos reconstruir la tripulaci\u00f3n de nuestro nav\u00edo para poder embarcar \u00e9picas luchas entre facciones. Nosotros... somos... \u00a1 los COWBOTS !\n\nLos personajes son increibles, desprenden carisma en todas las conversaciones, sabes de su pasado pasando de misi\u00f3n en misi\u00f3n, y los vas conociendo poco a poco, tanto que al final les coges cari\u00f1o, y sueles querer protegerlos y que no acaben en el desguace por culpa de tus malas decisiones t\u00e1cticas en el combate.\n\n\n[h1]CONTENIDO Y JUGABILIDAD[/h1]\n\nLo jugu\u00e9 con teclado y rat\u00f3n, aunque creo que con mando no deber\u00eda ser del todo ineficiente, mi regla es juegos en primera persona teclado y rat\u00f3n, en tercera mando, pero este juego al ser t\u00e1ctico, es un juego bastante pausado que te tienes que pensar tus movimientos, por lo tanto tampoco requer\u00eda de tener un mando para tener un mejor manejo de los personajes.\n\nTienes bastante contenido para un buen rato, ya que tenemos hasta 3 zonas repletas de misiones, unas principales, otras secundarias, y cada una constan de 3 estrellas, si realizas la misi\u00f3n sin perder a ning\u00fan compa\u00f1ero en batalla, recibiremos todas las estrellas y habremos completado la misi\u00f3n al 100%, a parte de haber completado una serie de objetivos dentro de esta.\n\nEn las misiones como m\u00e1ximo puedes llevar hasta 4 personajes, si la misi\u00f3n as\u00ed te lo permite. El rango est\u00e1 entre 1-4 cowbots, dependiendo de la misi\u00f3n. Cada cowbot suele ser especialista en un tipo de armas, por ejemplo hay personajes que se dedican a llevar fusiles de francotirador y tienen la peculiaridad de que si se mueven, hasta el siguiente turno no pueden disparar, otras llevan armas de corta distancia como escopetas o subfusiles, otros tienen bonificaciones de da\u00f1o por la espalda, son flanqueadores, y as\u00ed con muchos m\u00e1s.\n\nLos personajes despu\u00e9s de las misiones, si estos no han muerto en el intento, recibir\u00e1n experiencia para subir de nivel, y con ello aprender\u00e1n nuevas habilidades para el combate. Tambi\u00e9n hay tiendas en las cuales reabastecerte de armas y equipamiento para tus pr\u00f3ximas batallas.\n\nAlgo que tengo que destacar negativo de este juego, es su banda sonora. A mi parecer, no es mala, es decente para el juego que es, pero hay muy pocas canciones, y muy poca variedad entre unas y otras, y al final se me hac\u00eda muy repetitivo, hasta el punto de tener que quitar la m\u00fasica del juego.\n\nY otro punto negativo son sus DLC's, no compr\u00e9is ninguno, no merecen la pena, como mucho el The Outsider, ya que te ofrece un personaje nuevo, bastante interesante, pero solo si viene con el juego de base, o si est\u00e1 en oferta muy barato.\n\n\n[h1]CONCLUSI\u00d3N[/h1]\n\nEs un juego muy divertido, que requiere pensar si de verdad quieres sobrevivir, porqu\u00e9 en ciertos momentos el juego no es para nada f\u00e1cil. Por cierto, un punto muy positivo de este juego es la gran rejugabilidad que tiene y la de horas que te puede dar, 4 niveles de dificultad, muchas misiones para poder realizar y completar al 100%, Nueva Partida + y sumale el querer tener a todos los personajes al nivel m\u00e1ximo e idear combos y estrategias con todos ellos.

Oder auf einen einsamen Asteroiden, denn die Welt gibt es ja nicht mehr. Sie ist irgendwann auseinandergebrochen und auch die Menschheit ist Geschichte. Stattdessen spielt man einen Steambot, genauer eine dampfgetriebene Roboterdame, die mit einem kleinen Raumschiff gerade so \u00fcber die Runden kommt. Jedenfalls bis sie sich mit einer Armee von Schrottrobotern, einem Imperium dieselgetriebener Schn\u00f6sel und au\u00dferirdischen M\u00e4chten anlegt und dabei weitere Mitstreiter rekrutiert.\n\nDas geschieht rundenbasiert in sehr atmosph\u00e4risch gestalteten 2D-Arenen, die mit T\u00fcren und Leitern verbunden sind und die auch reichlich F\u00e4sser und \u00e4hnliches als Deckung aufweisen. Das ist auch notwendig, denn die Luft ist \u00e4u\u00dferst bleihaltig: In mehreren Kategorien sind die Roboter mit allerlei Waffen ausgestattet und k\u00f6nnen vom Revolver bis hin zum Raketenwerfer Unmengen von Zerst\u00f6rungswerkzeugen einsetzen. Dabei bringt jeder sein eigenes Spielzeug mit, doch die eingebauten Standardwummen sind nur f\u00fcr die ersten Missionen geeignet. Danach sollte man sich tunlichst mit den bei den Missionen gefundenen Knarren ausstatten oder einkaufen gehen.\n\nGezielt wird manuell, was f\u00fcr mich mit einem Gamepad ganz intuitiv funktioniert. \u00dcberhaupt ist der Einstieg recht simpel. Farblich markiert wird angezeigt, bis wohin man sich bewegen kann, um noch schie\u00dfen zu k\u00f6nnen bzw. wo man in Deckung gehen kann. Der Reiz entsteht mit den verschiedenen Mannschaftsmitgliedern und ihren mit dem Erfahrungslevel wachsenden Sonderf\u00e4higkeiten, die das Spiel teilweise komplett auf den Kopf stellen k\u00f6nnen. So provoziert Kraftprotz Bogdan \u201eThe Great\u201c Ivanski alle Gegner sich eine Runde lang nur auf ihn zu konzentrieren, w\u00e4hrend der flinke Farmbot Sally Bolt nach einem erfolgreiche Abschuss gleich nochmal feuern darf. Dazu kommen noch zahlreiche Gimmicks vom Erste-Hilfe-Kasten bis hin zu Raketenrucks\u00e4cken oder Ballettschuhen(!), die neue F\u00e4higkeiten verleihen, wenn die \u2013 je nach Mission \u2013 ein bis vier Roboter damit ausger\u00fcstet werden. All das verquickt sich zu einem sehr reizvollen Ausprobieren der verschiedenen Strategien gegen die zahlreichen Standardgegner und einige Zwischenbosse und Bossgegner. Die Gegner agieren clever aber nicht unfair und haben einige Asse im \u00c4rmel: W\u00e4hrend einige schlicht schie\u00dfen oder pr\u00fcgeln, verspritzen andere brennbares \u00d6l, k\u00f6nnen sich teleportieren oder Hilfe herbeirufen. Nettes Extra f\u00fcr Sammler: Jeder Robo hat einen Inventarplatz f\u00fcr einen Hut. Diese kann man kaufen oder schlicht dem Gegner vom Kopf schie\u00dfen!\n\nAll das ist sehr farbenfroh und detailliert in sch\u00f6nster Comicgrafik dargestellt, Explosionen und Animationen sind sehr gelungen, ebenso wie der einzigartige Soundtrack von Steampowered Giraffe und die am\u00fcsant geschriebene Story, die ein wenig an die SciFi-Serie Firefly erinnert. \n\nIch habe selten so einen Spa\u00df mit einem Spiel gehabt, weil man sich bei SteamWorld Heist Runde f\u00fcr Runde dar\u00fcber freuen kann, wenn ein Plan mal wieder richtig gut funktioniert - oder gnadenlos in die Hose geht.

I have nothing to compare it to because I personally have never played anything like it. Your characters only have so many moves on the 2D plane, 2 moves per turn and 1 of which can be an action. However, you have to move carefully, because when you act you sacrifice movement.\n\nI really like the strategy that this game presents, but I am TERRIBLE. I thought I was going to be able to 3-star everything, then there are 4-star missions and much harder enemies to deal with. The game continues to get better as it adds harder-hitting weapons and cooler items. I love putting a squad together.\n\nOverall, this game is really fun. If you like action/shooters with a blend of RPG/turn-based strategy?? I really don't know, but if you're interested this game is worth it.

Maybe I should, as I became quite enamored with this humorous steampunk cosmos and its hat-obsessed inhabitants. It's interesting what a coat of paint and a unique soundtrack can do to make a game stand out without it being super innovative. I don't mean that as an insult mind you. The mechanics of turn-based combat have been refined and tested through the ages and are skillfully displayed here with enough variety in items and individual character skills to keep you trying different strategies and loadouts. \n\nEverytime I start this game just for a quick mission or two I end up playing for hours. \n[i]Just one more mission. \nOk, one more then I'll go back to work. \nOk, it's 6pm might as well continue till dinner. \nOk, it's now 2am and my eyes sound like rusty gears in an old clock tower, time to go to bed, ok just one more! \nWeird, those birds are singing

It's a turn-based tactical RPG, but it's presented like a 2D platformer rather than a gridded map. Attacking is mostly skill-based rather than luck-based. Whether or not this is a good thing depends on how much you like rolling dice.\n\nThis is a game with personality. The graphics are solid. The characters are fun and unique. You can play the game different ways depending on which characters you roll with. The space bars have music by Steam Powered Giraffe, which is apparently a well-known musical group. You can shoot off people's hats and collect them, which is a really cool thing to include.\n\nI think anyone should try this game out, but there was one thing that let me down - the end of the game is a serious drag. The entire 3rd zone could have been left out and the game wouldn't have lost much.

Quoi ? Comment ? h\u00e9r\u00e9sie ? Pas vraiment puisque le gameplay s'adapte parfaitement. Le jeu est tr\u00e8s bien foutu et le level design aussi. Les personnages jouables, les armes et les aptitudes de chacun permettent de varier les plaisirs. \nIl est important de prendre son temps pour viser puisque les armes, sauf exception, n'ont pas de vis\u00e9e laser pour \u00eatre pr\u00e9cis. Apparemment, il y a une option dans le menu pour automatiser la vis\u00e9e (je ne m'en suis pas servi).\nLe jeu se d\u00e9coupe en niveaux et 3 chapitres. Chaque niveau octroie trois ou quatre \u00e9toiles qui permettent de d\u00e9bloquer la suite de l'aventure, des objets. Pour les obtenir, il faut finir le niveau, ramener l'\u00e9quipage entier et r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer la caisse avec une \u00e9toile. \nLes tr\u00e9sors rapportent de l'eau (monnaie du jeu), des armes plus ou moins int\u00e9ressantes et des accessoires. Il faut savoir que l'inventaire est limit\u00e9, mais peut \u00eatre agrandi (le besoin s'en fait rapidement sentir).\n\nLa direction artisitique est vraiment r\u00e9ussie. Le jeu a une vraie personnalit\u00e9 et elle est sublim\u00e9e par une bande-son exceptionnelle. Un bonheur des yeux et des oreilles.\nLe sc\u00e9nario est pr\u00e9texte, mais il a le m\u00e9rite d'exister. La dur\u00e9e de vie est bonne m\u00eame si je dois admettre que la lassitude est intervenue au troisi\u00e8me chapitre pour ma part. J'ai commenc\u00e9 en difficult\u00e9 exp\u00e9riment\u00e9e (troisi\u00e8me sur sept, je crois), puis je suis pass\u00e9 en habitu\u00e9 au troisi\u00e8me chapitre et en occassionnel pour le dernier boss (l\u00e0, c'est pour une autre raison que la lassitude). La difficult\u00e9 est modulable pour chaque niveau, ce qui est toujours une bonne id\u00e9e.\n\nLe jeu est bourr\u00e9 de qualit\u00e9s, mais il a aussi des d\u00e9fauts : il est r\u00e9p\u00e9titif \u00e0 cause d'un manque de renouvellement dans les situations propos\u00e9es. \nLe fait que seul les membres partis en mission et revenus vivants r\u00e9cup\u00e8rent de l'exp\u00e9rience pour d\u00e9bloquer de nouvelles aptitudes incitent fortement \u00e0 garder la m\u00eame \u00e9quipe. Sauf \u00e0 recommencer les missions pour monter les autres membres de l'\u00e9quipage. \nLes alarmes qui font d\u00e9gueuler des hordes d'ennemis sans fin tous les x tours, \u00e7a m'a gonfl\u00e9 tr\u00e8s vite surtout quand je voulais ramasser 100% du butin. Apr\u00e8s, ce n'est pas r\u00e9dhibitoire et juste prendre la caisse suffit la plupart du temps.\n\nPar contre, les boss sac \u00e0 PV et encore plus le dernier, \u00e7a a le don de me briser les noix. Et c'est la principale raison de mon passage en occasionnel sur le dernier boss qui, en plus d'avoir une montagne de PV, a des boucliers, plus des soldats qui en g\u00e9n\u00e8rent. Le combat en devient fastidieux et consiste \u00e0 esp\u00e9rer \u00eatre bien plac\u00e9 en ayant pas utilis\u00e9 la comp\u00e9tence qui permet d'avoir la salve meurtri\u00e8re infinie (tant que le personnage \u00e9limine un ennemi, son tour continue) pour en finir rapidement. M\u00eame dans la difficult\u00e9 la plus basse, il est chiant parce que beaucoup trop long sans r\u00e9elle \u00e9volution du combat. Je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 accepter un boss qui r\u00e9siste, mais faut rendre le combat dynamique, pas augmenter ses protections trois fois.\n\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, c'est un excellent jeu qui ravira les amateurs du tour par tour et pourrait m\u00eame en convertir certains au genre. A part les sacs \u00e0 PV qui sert de boss et une r\u00e9p\u00e9titivit\u00e9 qui peut s'installer, le jeu m\u00e9rite vraiment le coup d'\u0153il.\n\nP.S. : j'ai jou\u00e9 \u00e0 la manette et au clavier / souris.

SteamWorld Heist is a short but sweetly steam-powered space voyage, where you steer a trusty crew of steam-bots against a horde of scurvy foes.\n\nThe game's own description is accurate, in that chance does [i]not[/i] play a large part in combat. This is a turn-based strategy game where you fight and win through thoughtful positioning and careful aim. There are [i]no[/i] percentage chances of missing; all shots that you make are based on where you aim. Some of the weapons even come with laser-sights, teaching you about trajectories and ricochets so you'll be able to later eyeball it with other increasingly formidable firearms. You'll also be experimenting with a diverse crew who'll learn a host of exciting abilities as they level up through 10 levels of experience. You can even choose from 5 different difficulty settings to tailor the challenges you face, which affect the health and damage of your enemies, as well as how many of them you fight.\n\nIt's a lovely game, and you can complete a full playthrough in a day or less if you marathon it. However, outside of wanting to play through the game again with any DLC content you purchase later, I don't find much replay value here. There is a New Game+ mode, which allows you to play with your full crew unlocked (along with all the cosmetic hats you found), but everything else is reset (your crew members are set back to level 1 and you must restock your armory of guns and accessories from scratch).\n\nOverall, this is a game well-worth the time and money. With a story that spans over three different scenarios (each of which having their own faction to battle and conquer), you'll plunder plenty of pleasure with your clanking crew in SteamWorld Heist.", "timestamp_created": 1517165146, "timestamp_updated": 1517165146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532967", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39681450": {"recommendationid": "39681450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181031551", "num_games_owned": 415, "num_reviews": 136, "playtime_forever": 1018, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517141028}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u633a\u957f\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u7b56\u7565\u6218\u6597\u6e38\u620f\uff0cdig\u7684\u7eed\u4f5c\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u5728dig2\u4e4b\u540e\u3002\u524d\u671f\u5f88\u65b0\u9896\uff0c\u89d2\u8272\u5f88\u591a\uff0c\u5404\u79cd\u67aa\u652f\u5c1d\u8bd5\u8d77\u6765\u5f88\u6709\u65b0\u9c9c\u611f\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5173\u5361\u9700\u8981\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8d70\u4f4d\u548c\u654c\u4eba\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e5f\u8ba9\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u975e\u5e38\u5bcc\u6709\u53ef\u73a9\u6027\u3002\u753b\u9762\u548c\u97f3\u4e50\u90fd\u76f8\u5f53\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u4e2d\u540e\u671f\u5f00\u59cb\u5c31\u9700\u8981\u8010\u5fc3\u5730\u57f9\u517b\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8d2d\u4e70\u5404\u79cd\u597d\u4e00\u4e9b\u7684\u67aa\u652f\u6765\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f60\u987a\u5229\u8fc7\u5173\u3002Casual\u96be\u5ea6\u8fd8\u662f\u5f88\u7b80\u5355\u7684\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8boss\u4e5f\u4e0d\u7b97\u96be\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f11\u95f2\u6e38\u620f\u6765\u8bf4\u8fd8\u662f\u76f8\u5f53\u503c\u5f97\u4e00\u5165\u7684\u3002\n\u4e2a\u4eba\u66f4\u52a0\u63a8\u8350\u53bb\u73a9steamworld dig1\u548c2\uff0c\u7b2c2\u4ee3\u771f\u7684\u975e\u5e38\u5f3a\u608d\uff0c\u5236\u4f5c\u7ec4\u53ef\u8c13\u5bcc\u6709\u5b9e\u529b\u3002\n\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u8fd8\u662f\u503c\u5f97\u63a8\u8350\u7684\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1517144579, "timestamp_updated": 1517144579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39668583": {"recommendationid": "39668583", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088792312", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517530370}, "language": "english", "review": "STORY:\nFairly average story, theres some bad guys that you have to fight, then you have to fight the next level up of bad guys, then you get to the SUPER bad guys.

A good turn based strategy game, that makes sure you pay for any dumb mistakes you make during combat. Each character has a vastly different playstyle to them. For instance, the main character, Piper, is more about staying behind cover and ricocheting bullets off of the walls to kill enemies, while Seabrass is more about rushing in and wrecking their shit up.\nSETTING/ART:\nAs the title implies, the setting is steampunk.

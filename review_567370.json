The main thing that really makes the game is the greed mechanic - the first gold you pick up is worth 5, the next is worth 6 (for 11 total), then 7 (=>18) and so on. However if you die before depositing this gold back in the middle of the arena where you started, you get nothing, so you have to balance the risk of losing everything to the every increasing rewards for staying out longer.\n\nAs your expeditions last longer more enemy types appear, each with their own gimmick (green skeltins explode when you kill them, which is good, red skeltins move very fast, which is very bad, etc.), but the key is all of them can be killed by one shot (except maybe the boss at the end which I haven't reached), so the difficulty is in numbers and the special abilities some have, which I always find much more rewarding to prevail against than just endless amounts of tanky enemies that you need to empty entire clips to kill each one.\n\nAnother nice touch is the start menu - instead of being in a traditional menu system, all the features you would normally find in a game menu are laid out on the interior of the ship, so to turn the in game music off or to a different track, you go over to the radio, or to upgrade weapons you go to the upgrade machine in the other corner, and to start a game you drop through the hole in the floor down to the crater. You even have some motivational posters in there which explain the key mechanics of the game you might otherise miss (how the gold system works, why wraiths appear, how to kill the ball enemies in one shot).\n\nThe only down side I really found was once gold is no longer useful and you have no more upgrades to buy it takes away quite a lot of what this game work so well, but before then you will probably have a good few evenings blasting skeltins and being run over by balls while chasing after that big score.\n\nOverall this is highly recommended, and is perfectly suited to lots of short five minute gaming sessions whenever you get time, or longer \"just one more expedition, I promise I won't get too greedy this time\"", "timestamp_created": 1509717256, "timestamp_updated": 1511452692,

I have to say that it is well worth the \u00a32.79, and indeed that I'd consider paying up to \u00a36 for the provided experience. Atomic 79 is a fantastic Devil Daggers-esque arena runner where you follow your trusty mining robot (adorably designated F.R.A.N.D) around a dark crater to collect the gold it digs up, all the while avoiding and shooting the nefarious \"Skeltins\" that one-hit kill you if they reach your position.\n\nThough seemingly simplistic, the game has a lot of well-designed hidden depth that enriches the experience. Gold pickups' point value is incremented based on how much gold you are already carrying without depositing it, meaning the more gold you're willing to risk, the more you get. Strong, fast enemies spawn if the regular enemy spawn limit is reached, punishing the player for playing defensively and merely avoiding the Skeltins. The player's secondary weapon (a grenade) recharges its use based on enemies killed since it was last used, rewarding aggressive play again. All the weapons (including the grenade) can be upgraded with gold collected, and helpful posters around the starting area appear as features are encountered, explaining how to deal with them.\n\nAlso of note is the fantastic soundtrack by Aeronaut, which is consistently entertaining. Overall, Atomic 79 is a great game for either long or short play: a run generally takes under 5 minutes, though I find myself chaining runs together for over an hour at a time. The price is almost trivial, and great value for the received content, and I recommend everybody with an interest in roguelites, arena runners, voxel art, cute robots, neat electronic tunes, cool and well thought-out game mechanics, moon craters, and feelings of horror and impending doom as the grenade one threw illuminates the hordes of enemies ready to replace those caught in its blast check this game out.", "timestamp_created": 1486675040, "timestamp_updated": 1486675040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29798167": {"recommendationid": "29798167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019189167", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512935665}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought this after watching LoadingReadyRun play it on their stream, definitely worth the money.\nThe game looks great, the design of F.R.A.N.D. is really cute and the overall aethetic really achieves the look of a game that is fun and fast paced.

There's a really clever greed mechanic that gives you more gold for waiting longer to deposit in in the bank, with the obvious penalty of losing everything you're carrying if you die. It's absolutely gotten me several times, but it's just so tempting ... \nAnyway, it's difficult, but with the persistent upgrade system, you feel like you're actually progressing.

The setting and enemies are unique and have a weird, spooky cuteness to them. I particularly like the small range of visibility. Enemies seem to walk out of the darkness at you from every angle. Every death scares the bejeezus out of me and usually sends me into a fit of rage-laughter.\n\nMy only real complaint is that I can't seem to buy upgrades as quickly as I want to, but that is 100% attributed to my skill level.

Like all games, it took a few runs to get a feel for it, but honestly within 5-10 minutes it felt pretty natural.\n\nThe music is top-notch, and goes through a really nice loop. A lot of times I find myself getting irritated with songs in games where you continually start over repeatedly, but so far I haven't gotten sick of it. I also really enjoy the speed at which the difficulty ramps up. It takes a minute or two to really get going, which feels like just the right amount of time to warm up and get into the flow. The art style is also super cute! It manages to be both dark and super colorful at the same time, and I love the design of the \"spooky\" skeletons.\n\nThe only complaint I really have is that there's a pretty limited selection of weapons to choose from, though it seems pretty obvious that this is meant to be just a small, quick, fun little game, and as such isn't overflowing with content like that.

New weapons exist not to make the game easier (as each new weapon comes with it's shares of weaknesses to balance out it's benefits), but to add variety to the gameplay.\n-Fantastic soundtrack by Aethernaut.\n-Charming art design.\n-Light, easy gameplay quickly becomes difficult and chaotic about 2 minutes in, providing a nice challenge after a decent length warm up. \n-Time consuming achievements. Some may see this as a con, but I see it as an excuse to keep me playing the game until I can 100% it, and as a general rule of thumb, if a game can keep you playing it, it's doing something right.\n-Quick rounds of gameplay. I like that I can queue up for a dungeon in a game and then play a few rounds of this while I wait out my timer.\n-Moon physics. The game adds some additional difficulty through use of low gravity/friction. It's a bit difficult at first, but once you have it figured out it adds satisfaction to being able to navigate your way through a swarm of skeles. \n\nCons:\n\n-Some minor movement issues. While the moon physics don't bother me, I find myself dying a lot due to getting stuck on skele corpses and having my speed drastically slow down. While that does add some realism, it's somewhat frustrating to lose 100g because you get stuck on a body.\n-Lack of controller support. This is a minor issue, and I can understand it being difficult to enable since I tried to juryrig it using DS4Windows and it failed horribly (the right thumbstick could not come close to matching the sensitivity of the mouse movement).\n\nAll in all, an enjoyable experience.

Playing this right causes solid sweating after few minutes. The learning curve is quiet good and the fun playing it is going to increase with it.\n\nPersanally this is one of my favorite VR games now. It has not much content but the thing it does are mostly right. It has high replay value if you see it like me as a game for workout.\n\nThe most impressiv thing which did this game for me was to break my \u201egamepad-lethargy\u201c, how i call it now. Decades of playing just with keyboard & mouse or with a gamepad teached me to press a button or stick to move around and avoid to be hit by bullets. In VR games my reaction time was sooo sloooow and in many situation i just stood dump around and got hit and was frustrated. I could have moved a step right or left but somehow it didnt work. And then in Holopoint there was the moment then I jumped, yes JUMPED, to avoid a projectile. And now I constantly move around - using the little room I have in VR to it\u2018s full extend \u2013 to get the best angle to shoot or get to the savest spot in the room. I crouch, twist or bend my body to avoid projectiles.  No other VR game demand this much movement from its players than Holopoint. The constant necessary flow of movement, re-orientation, aiming and shooting is exhilarating and chilling in the same time.\n\nSure there are a few downsides in this game. Biggest is the poor bow mechanic compared with games like QuiVR. In QuiVR shooting with the bow fast feels natural and it is possible to headshot enemies over large distances. Using the bow in Holopoint feels awkward in the first place but gets better after a short time. My advice for people who come from QuiVR: look in the option menu and try around different settings, this helped me to get better results. The main reason for the awkward feeling is that the grip is too much below the center of the bow. It feels like you dont hold the grip but the bow arm below it. I dont know why the developer did this. They might had a reason and in time i got used to it. Now 95% shots are hits. There are also other things which could be adressed with little effort and would make the game even better. I hope the developer is going to put more work in this jewel to create a true tressure :)\n\n(Please excuse grammar failure and misspells.

The mechanics are simple; shoot a box and it explodes and shoots a projectile back at you, which you have to dodge (in later levels, samurai also steadily approach you and you have to shoot them before they get to you). Simple though they may be, they're tuned perfectly. You're always focusing on the next target, balancing the time to line up a shot with the urgency of the two boxes behind you that you can hear are getting ready to explode (boxes left un-shot will explode and shoot at you of their own volition: still dodge-able but much harder and less predictable).\n\nThe sound design is also excellent. As boxes near their exploding point, they make an unintrusive whooshing sound that builds to a crescendo. This is both long enough and balanced enough that you know exactly how long you have. It's also very well placed in the space around you, so you know what direction it's in. Excellent soundtrack as well.\n\nThe game is very physical. It is the only VR game I've come across that actually builds up a sweat. By some accounts the game can be cheesed a bit if you're methodical with dodges, but it's equivalent to using a dictionary in scrabble; it may give better results, but it's no fun. It's best played leaping and spinning around like a ninja. Treat it that way and it will entirely fulfil your Matrix fantasies.\n\nI always see it reccommended for new users but rarely evangalised, which I think is a crying shame. I think it's one of the most mechanically complete games available for VR. \n\n10/10 would arrow-ninja again.\n\nN.B. There's two different aiming mechanics. I highly reccommend switching it to 'two-handed', as this aims like a real bow (straight line from rear hand to front hand). The default mode uses the orientation of your front hand to aim and doesn't feel natural; your hand won't be where the string is. Any negative comparisons to archery in The Lab etc have probably not enabled this, as it makes the aiming systems identical.

Is that helpful? I think that describes this game pretty well after playing it for 50+ hours. At its heart it\u2019s another wave based survival game that strongly prioritizes your own reactive movements above all else. Yes, it\u2019s important to be accurate but you can miss an arrow here and there without the game ending. You yourself can only take two hits until it\u2019s Game Over, so getting the Hell out of the way is a bit more important than landing your shots. That being said, I\u2019d try to make every arrow count anyway as that\u2019s pretty key for your hitting a new high score. \n\nChasing after your high score is very addictive as no matter how low your score starts there is just something about knowing you\u2019re a faster and a better virtual bowman than the dude you just toppled on the leaderboard. There is a downside: good luck not tangling your Vive\u2019s cable. No, seriously, good luck. You\u2019re going to need it. Based on how often enemies attack you from behind it would be a damn miracle for your not to have a horrifically tangled mess by the time you\u2019re done with an intense play session. \n\nStill, even with that negative, I\u2019d urge you to buy Holopoint if any of this sounds vaguely interesting. It may not be the best bow and arrow simulator on the Vive (though I intend to find out what is) but it sure does make you feel like a badass\u2026 perhaps more than any other game before it.

That being said, what a fun, entertaining, and active game!  It requires you to move a LOT, and I very quickly found myself diving, crouching, leaning, and jumping around to dodge the holograms that shoot at you!  Reminds me of something from the hunger games.\n\nPros:\n-Very active.\n-Challenging.\n-Ability to start every 5 waves is awesome.\n-Difficult, but not TOO difficult to be overly frustrating (yet?)\n\nCons:\n-Aiming sucks.  Quite frankly, the bow mechanics are terrible!  Something that I think is VERY important in a VR game is that the place you \"grab\" the virtual model should line up with where your hand grabs the controller.  In this game, the handle of the bow floats above where you hold it.  This is bad.  Also, the draw length need to be adjustable! I'm 6' 2\", and  this bow seems like it would be better suited in the hands of somebody that's 5' 2\"...  The draw length needs to be adjustable so I don't have to have a bent front arm, and I can draw the arrow all the way back to my face/ear and look down the arrow. As a side note, I do real archery every once in a while.\n\n-Not very far in yet, but I'm curious as to how well this will be replayable... A great workout, for sure, but there is no story here.  Shouldn't really be a con, but just something to consider before purchasing.\n\nPlease fix bow mechanics/model position/etc.\n\nThat being said, it's a fun game, and once you get into it, the bow mechanics don't bug you that much.

At the time of this review, Steam says I have a bit over an hour in the game, which seems weird to me because I definietly feel like its been at least twice that.\n\nAnyway, this is very fun! It becomes a lot more than just point and shoot, as the floaty squares shoot projectiles at you when you destroy them, and explode if you leave them for long enough without destroying them. You end up shooting and dodging, and constantly turning to check behind and above you for newly spawned floaty cubes (not really sure what to call them!)\n\nEvery 5 waves you reach a sort of \"checkpoint\", ie when you die you can restart at that level - but only if you have reached that level at least once before.\n\nOnce you reach wave 10 the dudes start to spawn. At first they seem less dangerous than the floaty cubes, as they move slowly and dont shoot at you, but I found them harder to hit, and if they reach you it is actually quite terrifying when they swing their sword in your face! It really gives motivation to improve your aim and shoot them before they get too close.\n\nThis game is not yet perfect - my main complaint would be that the default aim is too low. It takes quite a bit of getting used to - I feel like I need to move my bowstring hand further down than I should just to get the arrow to fire straight and perpendicular to my body. As with almost all VR games at this point, it does feel like it could use a bit more work, but is still incredibly fun as it is at the moment.\n\nThe constant doding, moving and shooting can get quite tiring. Whilst not especially fit, I'm in OK shape, and I find this game gets me fairly sweaty after playing for a while. I normally need to go take a shower straight after playing! I'm hoping this will help me get a bit fitter though, as it definitely feels like a mini-workout playing this.\n\nAll in all a very fun game, and I definitely recommend you purchase it - unless, that is, you have the minimum amount of space to play in.\nThis game requires you move around a bit, and initially I only had the minimum area to play in with my Vive, and I feared for my controllers with the amount I was smashing them into things (thankfully they are still fine).\nOnce I managed to upgrade my space into a larger area it becamse a lot easier to play the game.\nYou can still try play it in a tiny space, but its really hard and not too fun, so you might need to give this a miss if you are playing in a tiny space.", "timestamp_created": 1470441513, "timestamp_updated": 1470441513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24717617": {"recommendationid": "24717617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014420819", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515177995}, "language": "english", "review": "Summary: Holopoint is a heck of a fun workout.

The bow handling feels terrible compared to games like QuiVR and of course The Lab's Longbow. \n\nEven when using the \"two-handed\" setting (and why isn't that the default?) it still feels awful. The motion is delayed and the endpoints don't align with the controllers properly.\n\nThe haptic feedback is all wrong, too. Again look at Longbow because how they do it makes sense. There should be vibration when you're pulling / slacking the string, but when you're holding it steady there shouldn't be vibration, obviously. This is another small thing that contributes to how \"off\" the whole handling feels.\n\nOther than that, I like the shoot / dodge concept.\nThe humanoid enemies drop from the first floor in a very clunky animation.\nThe game just isn't polished, from the basic handling, to the menus, etc etc.", "timestamp_created": 1470263978, "timestamp_updated": 1470263978, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603060", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24674227": {"recommendationid": "24674227", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971211540", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511053429}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a long time Oculus user but this game is what convinced me room scale is it.

It's just ugly to see a proud Samurai move in a straight line, with strange posture from the balkony to the ground. And as he approaches you, you see that it is not a Samurai, it's some white knight guy wielding a japanese sword. \n\nIf you don't look to close, the game mechanic is great and it is fun to shoot the boxes and dodge the projectiles. But the essence of a bow and arrow game is the bow. If it's not great, it doesn't matter what you have to do, or what you have to shoot. It could be a great game, but right now, in my eyes, it is not and not worth the money. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1468412143, "timestamp_updated": 1468412143, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24245295": {"recommendationid": "24245295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019424962", "num_games_owned": 508, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484412652}, "language": "english", "review": "FUn, dodging feels like a good workout(at least more than what I'm used to).

I recommend purchasing it, $15USD isn't too much for such a neat experience. \n\nBought this game yesterday, and I've only played it about 45 minutes so far. This number *WILL* increase. \n\nFirstly this game is rather awesome. I've played maybe 15 VR games, and this one is the first to make me squeal like a little girl. The archery is almost spot on (more on that later), the waves of enemies build up nicely, and there's more variety in oppoents than Space Pirate Trainer for example.\n\nThe Enemies: First off you start with some harmless looking cubes, which shoot things at you. These aren't too bad, and if you just dodge they seem to go away even if you miss. Then all of the sudden there's so many cubes, all you can think of is \"F*** I hope there's not one behind me!!\" Things calm down for a second when the next enemies are introduced, a swordsman. He doesn't shoot thigns at you and just comes at you with a raised sword. Relentlessly. And before you know it you've now gotta pay attention to where the sword guys are while the cubes fire more missiles at you. It's pandemonium. There are more enemies, and at least one boss, but I'll let you find them. \n\nMovement: Takes advantage of roomscale. Enough said really, although I have a roughly 2x2.5m space and I wouldnt want to be playing in any smaller, because have I mentioned that you move. Like a lot, jumping, dodging, weaving (falling over...)  I'd having a guess that this is probabaly the most active game on VR currently, and defintely the most active I've played.\n\nCombat: The archery is good, one handed mode is sort of like The Lab, and two handed mode is more how real life is like. Sadly, I wasn't fully happy with the way the controller was mapped to the bow, it feels like you're holding it too low. About 5-10cm (2-4\" for you Americans) too low. You can adjust to this, but I just feel that the archery would be perfect if it was changed a little. Devs, maybe an option to change the grip height on the bow? \n\nOverall, this is an awesome game. I love it. If you like the archery in The Lab and games like Space Pirate Trainer, I recommend picking it up.  \n\nPerformance: On my system this game works really well, and is fairly easy on hardware. My GPU's don't run VR terribly well, but at no point did I experience any desire for more framerate. Note: I haven't tried in single GPU mode, but in every other VR game that I've had performance issues with, one card is better than two. \ni5 2500k @ 4.6GHz\n16GB DDR3 RAM @ 1333MHz\nAMD 7970 GHz edition x2 (Crossfire)\n", "timestamp_created": 1467116842, "timestamp_updated": 1467116842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23850615": {"recommendationid": "23850615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033175545", "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466991376}, "language": "english", "review": "Tl;Dr:\nProbably fun for someone who haven't shot a real bow, but for some who has it's way off\n\nI wish I would love this, but I don't. It feels so unatural.\nI used to shoot at homemade humanlike targets set up in the fields behind my house almost everyday as a teenager. I got custom to shooting the bow and how to do it efficntly. And this games translates it so bad to VR. \n\nI kept hitting my Vive a lot in the begining since on a real bow you usually pull the arrow fairly close to your face. This became frustarting fairly quick.\nwhen I stopped pulling it towards my face it felt unutural how far to the side I had to pull it. Also my hands felt positioned incorrect no matter how I moved them.\n\nI'd like to see an otpion to calibrate, bow postion, string postion, draw hand position according to where the controlers are. The same for the quiver. Since I personally find belt quiver superior to back quiver, and I am not the only one when it comes to that.\n\nBUT, the rest of the game seems well fleshed out for an early VR archercy game.\n\nThis game is probably really fun for people who haven't shot a real bow before or are good at adapting to \"an odd way of shooting a bow\"", "timestamp_created": 1467000708, "timestamp_updated": 1467377332, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474561", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23801266": {"recommendationid": "23801266", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056959667", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474177467}, "language": "english", "review": "If You're looking for Longbow but with more action packed (and fast paced) goodness, then this is the game for you.

I don't know if you can skip them at the begining since I've gotten far past them since, but if you happen to lose on, say, wave 9, you have to back track and redo some of the tedium.

Its there, and there are leaderboards, but the best way to get points is a mystery.

You shoot with arrows on blue boxes that unfortunately shoot back which requires you to step aside or move your head aside in order not to get shot. Later you will fight again holographic moving enemies.\n\nIt is very difficult and to be honest in the beginning discouraging. Just try at bit more often. Do not fell the temptation to immediately refund the game.\n\nMake sure to play in the morning or at least when you feel yourself fit enough. It is not the sunday hang-over game or the after-work tired lazy gaming experience. \n\nBringing PC gaming and sports together. That's what it is.\n\nHighly recommended for the fitter gamers out there or those that want to be fit again after year of lazy seated gaming.

And then trying out The Lab and seeing how interacting with VR worlds could seem natural and just... real. But they both felt like the type of thing that would be more useful for \"Hey, you have to check *this* out\" when friends come over, rather than any sort of lasting experience.\n\nAnd then there's this little $8 game. Even though it requires a high-end PC and an $800 headset thingie, it somehow reminds me of some of the very first video games, in a very very good way. It's just pure gameplay. There's no gimmicks, no plot, no nothing, just you and a high score list, but the gameplay is so damn *fun* that that's all you care about.\n\nAs (many) other reviews on the interwebs say, yes, it does in fact make you feel like a badass. When you duck underneath a cyber-samurai's sword swing while drawing back your bow to take out another one off to the side, yeah, you feel ridiculously cool. And that's because Holopoint just strips away everything and somehow makes you feel you're *there*. It is so viscerally satisfying.\n\nA couple of things that could impact your Vive's livelihood. First, after playing this for 15-20 minutes, I started to sweat a bit. Which hasn't come close to happening with any other VR thing I've played. Maybe a little bit with the (similarly simple but beautiful) Space Pirate Trainer, but not to this degree. So you might get some damp (and eventually stinky) Vive foam.\n\nSecond, as a few other reviews point out, you move around a *lot* in this game. I've yanked the Vive's cable from its little dock with my feet three times now. And I've pulled out my earplugs an equal number of times. It's frantic, and you pivot around constantly. Plus, ducking and weaving and dodging out of the way. I did find that after playing for an hour or so, my brain started to somehow process where I was in the real world while paying attention in the virtual world, and things got a little better. I found myself raising my feet, anticipating where the cord would be. Or turning counter-clockwise after turning clockwise a few times to untangle the cord. And I also found myself relaxing a bit and being less spazzy overall after playing for a while, which also helps.\n\nI kind of expected that VR games would give me the whoas, and be really cool things to show off to friends. I had no idea that some $8 launch title would also fall into that rare category of game where if I have 10 free minutes I'll go fire it up, thinking \"OK, time for just one round...\" This game does that.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1463957963, "timestamp_updated": 1463957963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23147218": {"recommendationid": "23147218", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968842755", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477696954}, "language": "english", "review": "I just did exercise for the first time in over 5 years and loved every second of it!!!\n", "timestamp_created": 1463957841, "timestamp_updated": 1463957841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23146269": {"recommendationid": "23146269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067028859", "num_games_owned": 1427, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513382827}, "language": "english", "review": "This is basically that one archery scene from the hunger games mashed with the bullet dodging from the end of The Matrix.\n\nSadly, it won't teach you kung fu, but it is INSANELY fun to play.

Seems simple untill they start shooting back. The idea is that you have eyes in the back of yor head so you can both eliminate cubes for points and avoid cubes shooting at you. When a cube dies it more often than not shoots you, when a cube turns orange it shoots you. How do you avoud these shots? You dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge your way around them. Also there is samurai and ninjas.\n\n[b]Is Holopoint good?[/b]\nHolopoint has amassed an impressive 97% positive feedback and with good reason, it is simple but fun. You need no archery skill and it works well even in a relatively small space and for a measly \u00a35 pricetag it is tempting to say no to.\nFor how cheap the game is and for how much fun and exercise you and some friends can get I think that Holopoint is very much worth it\n\n[b]Is anything bad?[/b]\nIf i'm nitpicking then i'd say that there is no real tutorial and that it was frustrating realising that physical movement is required to progress in this game (which is a lot to ask from a nerd), only other points are perhaps the lack of bow options or any kind of features that would make the game more complex.

Let me explain.\n\nNormally these actions would not be a big deal. The problem stems from the pace of the game...which is super fast paced and with dodging. \n\nFirst: when you go to pull an arrow from the quiver (on your back) the vive controller tends to clip my headphones (I use over the ear can style 7.1 surround sound...NOT CHEAP headphones!), and since the pace is so fast...I tend to hit them pretty hard violently knocking them from my head. I am worried I will break my vive controler and/or a $200 set of headphones.\n\nSecond: The enemies shoot back when you hitt hem with an arrow. They do this so quickly that you havbe to move your head VERY fast to dodge the return shot. If you wear large can style headphones like I do, this allmost throws them across the room. Not cool.\n\n$8 game vs $200 headset or $1000 VR rig....you decide.\n\nTL;DR This game needs to chill a bit out with the action or you will break your headset/VR equipment.

Very simple control scheme and solid bowplay.\n\nPros:\n+Most solid archery I have played yet.\n+Hitboxes are perfect.\n+Nonstop balls to the wall action with a very pleasing difficulty curve.\n+It's so intuitive you're garunteed to understand it immediately.\n+Immense replayability.\n\nCons:\n-I can't really think of anything? Is being too intense a con? It's not a relaxing game. If you have a sports injury or are otherwise disabled this title is probably not for you.\n-I get tired and can't play this game all day.", "timestamp_created": 1461745957, "timestamp_updated": 1461746407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22658856": {"recommendationid": "22658856", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276947354", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461761672}, "language": "english", "review": "best Fun Ive had in VR so far with Holopoint", "timestamp_created": 1461745065, "timestamp_updated": 1461745065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22658426": {"recommendationid": "22658426", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960691134", "num_games_owned": 374, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461809290}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

LAG. \n\nYes, 90fps is pretty much necessary for VR games, but this game doesn't want to cooperate. It's not even that graphically intense of a game, so why am I getting tons of lag playing it? \n\nMy computer has a beast of a CPU. 5930k at 4ghz. My GPU is a little below recommended, but it's fine for basically all the other VR games I have played. A GTX 780. That's basically as good as a 970, and yet I can't handle playing Holopoint? \n\nBesides the performance problems, this game is pretty cool. Shooting arrows is a little different than The Lab though- the trajectory of the arrow is determined by your \"bow hand\", meaning you can angle your bow hand to change the direction of the shot. This is different than The Lab which changes the arrow trajectory based on the combination of your draw hand and your bow hand. The Lab does it more \"Realistic\" compared to Holopoint, but that doesn't make Holopoint bad necessarily It\u2019s just not preferred. Also, the arrows go MUCH straighter than \u201cThe Lab\u201d which has a lot of arch to their shots, and travel slower. These arrows travel much more straight, and faster. This means you can be more precise with them. It\u2019s pretty satisfying actually.\n\nThat being said, the game itself is going to be a workout at first. With each enemy you shoot with an arrow, you get a projectile that launches at you and you must dodge. This is a little jarring at first, but it does make the game very\u2026 Dynamic. You are constantly moving, and it adds a layer of intensity that wouldn\u2019t be there otherwise. This game is as much of a shooting game as it is a dodging game, love it or hate it. I don\u2019t know how I feel about it, but I think I like it overall. It\u2019s not \u201cpassive\u201d like The Lab, which the player sees virtually no threat to one\u2019s self. \n\nIf the LAG wasn\u2019t so bad, I would like the game MUCH more, but alas, I don\u2019t want to play it as much because of the framerate issues. I wish I could lower graphical settings, but this game doesn\u2019t have any settings to configure that I can see.\n\nIt\u2019s a very arcade experience, but it\u2019s a pretty cool one. I\u2019d give it a shot, and if you feel like the framerate isn\u2019t where it needs to be, than perhaps return it.", "timestamp_created": 1461247845, "timestamp_updated": 1461247845, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22543591": {"recommendationid": "22543591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076304035", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485701928}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "Amazing Game!!\nuse all you body to play the game,\nkeep shooting and avoiding!", "timestamp_created": 1461207054, "timestamp_updated": 1461207054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22541611": {"recommendationid": "22541611", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976631706", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483023589}, "language": "english", "review": "My english isn't good enough and maybe i'm not as sober as i should be but damn, this game is everything you expect from VR. \nInstant action on your fingertips, immersion and the illusion you actually did something for your health - if you liked Space Pirates, Audioshield or Vanishing Realms, this is for you.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1461193800, "timestamp_updated": 1461193800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22541288": {"recommendationid": "22541288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031918108", "num_games_owned": 375, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494440428}, "language": "english", "review": "My favourite VR experience so far!

This goes on with every increasing amounts and eventually you simply cannot hit them all before one shoots without you hitting it first... and thats when things change radically and new types of enemies start relentlessly be thrown, a suprise after another. And no, there are no shields, so no turtleing, and you have to dodge all the projectiles.\n\n Thats when things get really interesting and accuracy becomes very important. \n\nAnd its not just Point and shoot, you have to use both your hands to align your shots at your target, and coordinate with the other to reach the quever.

You will be ducking, dodging, side stepping all while aiming a bow with enemies coming at you from 360. You also will need to be in good shape. I played two sessions of 10 minutes each because I just had to tap out, the game is very physically demanding for someone like me who is not in good shape. I was sweating on my HMD and just had to quit. Not only that, but I was tripping over my wired headset. If you have a wireless headset, then this game is perfect. If you don't, you'll have to setup your wires or just be very cognizant of this problem.\n\nI had a lot of fun. This is like a shooting gallery / obstacle course. There is no story or beating the game. It's about challenging yourself (and if you're good at the game, challenging others). Shooting fast, accurately, and moving quickly. This game is really a workout. If you want fun in your cardio workout, this is it. I have no idea how some players scored so high that are on the leaderboards, but my hat is off to them.\n\nThere's basically two modes. One is a wave mode that saves every 5 waves I believe. Meaning, you can start from wave 1. And if you make it to wave 5 you can start from there instead of wave 1. I was only able to get to wave 6 on normal difficulty (level 4 difficulty - difficulty ranges from 1 to 8). There is also a timed mode where you can choose the enemies and go for the highest score. When I chose the Orange men who throw shuriken at you, I basically got hit over and over again even though I was firing as fast as I could. They were excellent in invading. So many times I just just inches away from where they were moving. The other two enemies were blue boxes that eventually turn orange and explode a projectile towards you if you don't shoot them fast. Even when you shoot and hit them, they explode and shoot a projectile towards you, so you have to know to evade after you hit the target. There's also these blue men that walk towards you. There's probably more enemy types, but I didn't get very far in the waves.\n\nI don't think I have ever played a game that is more fun and challenging that is also this much of a workout. I know I could have tuned down the difficulty level, but I guess I just have too much pride. Anyways, my only real criticisms are that it felt like at times it was harder than it had to be to get out an arrow and put it on your bow to rapid fire. I eventually got used to it though.

It does deal with child abuse, like extreme child abuse, so if you're sensitive to that type of stuff, you don't have to read this, however if you're a fan of the series and don't care, then go ahead it's still a masterpiece. \nThis is the first novel I read with the ps3 patches and made it so much better like serioursly, you can read it vanilla but it's just so much better patched.

Every time, I swear that this won't either surprise or annoy me, it ends up being a new creep-bomb... Ehm, sorry. This is the third game in [i]Higurashi When They Cry series: Ch.3 Tatarigoroshi.[/i] Invoking what I gathered from the publishing information in Manga Gamers forums priorly, the original series consist of 8 chapters, which will probably keep inventing new and refreshing ways to both consternate and creep us out continuously, both with the imaginatively disturbing and the eerily mysterious that serves as the main body of these Hinamizawa stories.\n\nFor every story so far - no different in [i]Tatarigoroshi[/i] - we take the role of Keiichi Maebara, a high school student who has just moved into the silent mountain town of Hinamizawa. Identical to previous plot paces, he befriends some lovely yet quirky ladies from his class, and comes to care for them deeply. Here in this specific scenario, the one he seemed to make a connection with the most, is no other than Hojo Satoko: the mischievous, the unruly and the childish one of the bunch. As a pacing tradition to Higurashi games, we observe the first half of the game to be a lovable background story, which is a narrative build of friendship, mixing up with some drama. We already know that things won't be the same after the night of annual Watanagashi festival at this point, right? Well, in this specific arc, things won't wait 'till Watanagashi to get creepy. Warm and careless days of innocence comes to a halt with the appearance of a long gone relative of Satoko, and from the appearance of the said individual, things will become maddeningly violent, illogical, gruesome and even catastrophic at the end. So, brace yourselves 'cause I think this was the most unpredictable game in the series so far.\n\nEach chapter's name presents a unique clue for the events to be revealed within the arc, so Tatarigoroshi means \"the Curse Killing\": implying a backbone for the mystery of the series, which is still to be revealed. Also, it could be useful to note that this was the longest chapter in the series so far, which heavily played on a tone of tragedy. Thus, it has taken for some time for me to complete. I remember feeling overwhelmed and quitting the game frequently, which is actually a compliment on the narrative ability of the game. In previous games, you have endured paranoia - Onikakushi - and crippling terror - Watanagashi through Keiichi's perception, but in this game, we will endure desperation nonetheless, and what could it drive a singular person to go through. One could endure terror/horror/paranoia in fiction maybe, but the complete inability to overcome anything has always been the soft belly for me, especially when that inability is carefully explained with realistic condition. It just... drives one crazy enough. On that manner, it has been the hardest game to go through in the series, at least for me. Believe it or not, I've been trying to complete this one since the end of April and only today I managed to do so - which is the end of June. Nope, this doesn't mean it is a bad game; it means that it presents the core emotion of the protagonist really, really well so it becomes unbearable for the reader.\n\nI have already shared the most common facts concerning the artwork, the pacing, the gameplay etc. in my previous reviews for Ch.1 and Ch.2: I have nothing more to add concerning those areas. I may only note that with each new game the developer seems to gain more experience in the utilization of sound effects. This time, I actually had some jumps and chills induced without even reading the rest of the text. The moment the sound changes, you know that something ominous is at hand. The best in the genre I've seen so far.\n\n[i]Higurashi[/i] has been an exceedingly well woven, emotionally tiresome mystery as it was intended to be so, so far. I believe all these games hold some variations of the same time period for our protagonists, making them relive the same couple of months from the summer of 89 in different probabilities. What makes it so, and on what purpose; I sincerely cannot fathom but it always ends with gruesome murders and breaking psyches addled with mystery. The duality between the supernatural and the rational is ever present, neither one side capable of presenting any explanation so far. Only in playing furthermore we will discover. I wish you determination to see it 'till the very end. I know that I'll need it.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_created": 1497972566, "timestamp_updated": 1498034011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.843536", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32359872": {"recommendationid": "32359872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023008403", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1789, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485739205}, "language": "english", "review": "3rd installment of the legendary Higurashi series, make sure you install the voice pack!", "timestamp_created": 1497253233, "timestamp_updated": 1497253233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32143683": {"recommendationid": "32143683", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980449859", "num_games_owned": 590, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496462192}, "language": "english", "review": "Time for round three.

That's partially why I'd say this is my favorite in the series so far.  There is a lot this chapter does right that I want to ramble on about in addition to that.\n\nFirst of all the writing in this chapter was some of the strongest. The emotions of the characters were expressed perfectly. The desperation of the protagonist and the reactions of his friends to what was happening seemed disturbingly genuine. Also the imagery and description of events were clear and vivid. These various scenes were further enhanced by the change in music or ambient noise. Although mostly the latter plays in the background there were a few tracks that really stood out and made their apperance that much more interesting.\n\nThe story was by far the most intriging of the franchise so far. In the previous chapters the first half is usually light-hearted or relaxed. While the begining was like that in this one and provided new character development, it also got to a lot of dark themes before the major shift in tone. It's worth noting that this installment is the most emotionally difficult one so far as the themes it covers are serious issues and therefore would not be for the faint-hearted. After I thought things would maybe change for the better for the cast the story ramps up even further to the point where I was question what was going on.\n\nOverall if you read the previous chapters I would say to definitely get this one once you get the chance to.

If you do, you will be frustrated and possibly bored because what most people expect after one chapter is a second chapter that happens directly after the first.\n\nThis is not the case with the Higurashi series. Each chapter presented is almost like an alternate universe with the same characters and settings but different plots and an extra character or two added. They cannot be read smoothly one after the other which is why I've learned to space my playtime between them carefully.\n\nYou just need to put enough distance so your memories of the other chapters aren't very fresh, and then you can really appreciate what's going on.\n\nSo, let's get the bad things out of the way, shall we?\n\nTHE MUSIC!\nOkay, well, it was really only two of the new musical entries added to this chapter that set me off, and that was for the simple reason of them being inappropriate. Want to know what I mean? The first new arrangement we're given is random jungle party music (I'm not joking, you hear those rainsticks or whatever piping in the background and you think you're reading Tarzan), and luckily it's only in the very beginning-- where something horrible happens.\n\nWhy do I want to listen to Jungle Boogie when something serious is going on? You're killing the mood.\n\nThe second musical arrangement, that was not greatly appreciated, is a piano piece that is also, surprisingly, only heard in the beginning (except when it comes back in the very beginning of chapter eleven). It's too bright and happy, and also plays during an inappropriate time when some really devastating topics are being discussed. And although I didn't mention this in my last review, the music added to the second chapter, Wataganashi, was great, and I think my favorite music by far. It's just these two entries that...my God, are so inappropriate. \n\nBut the rest of the soundtrack is good to excellent so don't worry about it too much once you're past the beginning.\n\nNow here's a list of all the GREAT things about Tatarigoroshi:\n1. A major story-telling improvement from the second chapter, Watanagashi (it doesn't waste time to set things up and get moving, although the writers did try to hammer in a theme about 'big brotherhood' or whatever early on and I have to say, it's a little too on the nose).\n2. A whole lot funnier than I anticipated! I don't remember laughing too much in the Watanagashi chapter (and I mean laughing in the places where you're supposed to laugh, not giggling and dancing to Simba's frat music in the midst of a homicide).\n3. The baseball game is absolutely beautiful (\"They...had a really fun talk about how delicious dessert is, probably!\" Oh, Rena, you have no idea).\n4. Finally get to see Chie-sensei, and I have to say, she is more attractive than I could have ever imagined with the personality that was set up for her in the Watanagashi chapter.\n5. Rena's pervertedness and split personality make a return and I love it.\n6. Chapter six is a shit-show...and so is seven, eight, and the list goes on (chapter six also graces us with an astounding new piano piece that I thought really captured the heart of Tatarigoroshi...unlike that one in the beginning). \n7. Oh my God. Ooishi-san. He's delicious and mysterious as always...get it? No? Okay... (And I know this is an audio-visual novel but this one very specific sound during the first Ooishi encounter is-- oh my God I'm still cringing).\n8. I know this chapter focuses on Satoko and I'm supposed to feel bad for her because that's pretty much all we've done for whoever's chapter we're reading, but...in freaking chapter eight, my sympathy for her dropped. Not all the way to zero but...is it bad if I say, \"Just Desserts?\" (And yes, I know it's supposed to be 'deserts' but that looks weird to me and I've been spelling it wrong like everybody else so just gimme some cake, mm'kay?).\n\nI could honestly go on about this chapter but I think this list is more than enough to convince you (to read it, I mean). I love how the writers went back to their roots in Onikakushi (the first chapter) and really pulled from what made that one so great. Tatarigoroshi is definitely not as amazing as Onikakushi, but the series seems to be getting back up there slowly.\n\nI look forward to Himatsubushi...and I hope the soundtrack is carefully composed.", "timestamp_created": 1494009366, "timestamp_updated": 1506008800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508558", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31312025": {"recommendationid": "31312025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197896761", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 1213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492922344}, "language": "english", "review": "This time in the Higurashi series we will be dealing with Satako this time around.

Like the first two chapters, in this Higurashi chapter, you take on the role of Keiichi Maebara who lives in the town of Hinamizawa and follow him as he lives his daily life there with his friends Rena, Mion, Satoko, and Rika.  The focus of this chapter is on Satoko and you see how the relationship between Keiichi and Satoko becomes closer and you find out about Satoko's back story-in particular, regarding her older brother Satoshi.  Although Satoshi has been mentioned in the previous chapters, we really get to know more about him this time.  Of course, just like in the other chapters, a certain event takes place but there are new events that occur as well, mainly because they revolve around Satoko.  Later on in the story, certain events happen that can confuse the reader but I won't reveal what they are.  I will say, though, that it'd be a good idea to play chapters 1 and 2 of Higurashi before delving into this one.  ;)\n\nNow as to what I thought of this Higurashi installment.  I enjoyed it as much as the previous ones and I ended up liking and feeling sorry for Satoko more.  In the previous chapters, Satoko was portrayed as merely being a prankster but as you play through this chapter, you find out that there is a lot more to her and she becomes likeable.  I liked the twists later on, which were confusing although I did come up with some interesting theories as a result of them.  (I can't wait for the future chapter arcs to come out to find out if I'm right.  XD)  There are the usual music pieces as well as new ones although I'm not a fan of the new pieces.  They sounded a bit grating to the ears at times although I might just have sensitive hearing.  lol  There is one thing I should mention, especially for those who have played the previous Higurashi chapters.  Unlike the others, after you complete a \"day/chapter,\" it doesn't automatically get unlocked in the Extras section.  You have to play the entire game through to get all of them unlocked at once.  Just thought I'd note this since I initially thought that this was a bug but it only turned out to be a slightly difference in programming.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Higurashi When They Cry Hou-Ch. 3 Tatarigoroshi as much as I enjoyed the previous chapters and this one is definitely the darkest one yet.

Confusion and Insanity starts to take over and suddenly nothing makes sense anymore. \n\n[b]Graphics: 8/10[/b]\nCharacter design has been pretty much the same from the past two novels, but at least this time they added two new character portraits and a couple of new locations. \n\n[b]Storyline: 10/10[/b]\nFollowing the pattern from the first two novels, it starts off slow again and gradually picks up as the story progresses further. In this arc, it\u2019s all about Satoko and her family. Around chapter 8 is where the real story starts and a lot, and I mean a lot of confusion will take over you. Although, this is somewhat cleared up towards the last chapter. In my opinion, this is far by the best arc in the Higurashi When They Cry series. \n\n[b]Sound: 7/10[/b]\nThere are some similarities with the soundtrack from the first two novels, but they did add a few new ones which seemed \u2018off\u2019. It almost felt like the new added soundtrack didn\u2019t match some of the scenes. \n\n[b]Gameplay: 9/10[/b]\nAnd this is a first\u2026the game didn\u2019t crash even ONCE! Unlike with the first two novels. However, I spotted more spelling and grammar errors in this novel. Although, in terms of actual \u2018gameplay\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s exactly the same as from the previous novels.\n\n[b]Price: 10/10[/b]\n\u00a35.59 is a steal, it\u2019s a great offer for this novel, especially for the amount of content it has.

Several incredible new tracks are introduced at major moments in the story.\n\t[*][b]Pacing[/b] --- The decrease in establishment duration is greater than the jump from Ch. 1 to Ch. 2. Understanding the characters and setting heavily depends on the reader recalling the events of the previous chapters, more than what was required for Ch. 2's buildup. Virtually no time is spent retreading old ground as the twists come sooner than expected and the few supplementary Tips provided are highly redacted reports. Remembering even the most minor details across all three chapters will be necessary to keep up with character placement and their possible motivations.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n[list]\n\t[*][b]Story[/b] --- Whereas Ch. 1 and Ch. 2 had relatively self-contained stories, this chapter's value is highly interpretive without having read any of the subsequent scenarios. Either it is the most underwhelming in realizing its full potential after so much foreshadowing, or it contains one of the most diabolical plots ever constructed that will make the other chapters pale in comparison when all is said and done.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe horror element for Ch. 3 has a far lesser presence compared to previous chapters. The main character, and the reader, are made to experience extreme situations only after they occurred off-screen. It is the emotional aftermath of these events that contribute to most of the tension.\n\nIn the rare occurrence that the main character is forced into a dire circumstance, it is he who seemingly has the sole advantage, unlike Ch. 1 where he found himself alone against an unknown force and Ch. 2 where he leaned upon his friends for assistance. This sudden sense of power comes with its own downsides as the main character's impulsive behavior leads him to lose a grip on reality, briefly returning the series to Ch. 1's atmosphere of paranoia combined with a mysterious, unresolved character element that was introduced in Ch. 2.\n\nIn summary, is this chapter good? Having not read the rest of the series as of this review to know for sure, it's hard to say. All throughout, the explicitly odd behavior and comments of certain characters all fly past the main character without eliciting any further investigation as they would have in previous chapters. It may be intentional, as he becomes increasingly irrational over the course of the story by allowing his emotions to overtake his ability to reevaluate if everything is as he believes it to be. However, the readers' possible suspicions of something more emotionally manipulative taking place are never entertained.\n\nThe quality of this chapter hinges on the importance of a certain discussion about the concept of \"the perfect crime.\" Does the main character possess an unnatural influence to affect Higurashi's story, or is he a pawn following in someone else's footsteps? With an explosive ending that can be interpreted both ways, Ch. 3 is a scenario that can be made retroactively brilliant depending on where the story goes next.\n\nNovel length is roughly [b]10 hours[/b] depending on reading speed.

As usual, silly funtimes give way to horrible stuff, but the transition happens quicker this time around than it did in the previous two storylines.

Emotional journey through [spoiler]child abuse[/spoiler] and feelings of powerlessness with a pinch of psychological horror. It is amazing. Buy it.\n\n--\n\nAlthough Higurashi is supposed to be a series of scenarios involving the exact same setting and characters, all three games up until this point have been different. Not only are events different, but so is our protagonist, Keiichi.\n\nBoth in Onikakushi and Watanagashi, Keiichi was still treated as a newcomer who was just barely integrating. He was oblivious to all history, legends and traditions of Hinamizawa, and people seemed to hide it all from him. He was more like an overwhelmed (Ch1) or a worried, kind-hearted (Ch2) victim. Tatarigoroshi, however, is the first time we see Keiichi act as a true villager who accepts Oyashiro-sama's legend fairly quickly and decides to take matters into his own hands (unlike Ch1, where he only acted in self-defense). It was refreshing to see him as an active agent for once.\n\nThe writing when describing his machinations and apprehension as he carries out his plans pulls you in. You feel for him and root for him. You feel your heart beating faster and catch yourself swearing at him when he does something he shouldn't have. As the reader, you see possibilities that the party actually involved --a distressed, emotional, impulsive teenage boy-- isn't even able to. He is so desperate to do something, so eager to save Satoko in any way, that he often gets carried away and is unable to think reasonably (as much as he likes to point out otherwise). He is always fighting and crying for help at the same time, whenever he runs his mouth and says something he shouldn't have. Even as he carries out an unthinkable act, his emotions are understandable and written in an incredible way.\n\nAnd then, of course, we have Satoko. She was my least favourite character out of the main bunch so far, but Tatarigoroshi made me like her. The depiction of her relationship with [spoiler]her abusive uncle[/spoiler] and her emotional scars was very realistic, and so were Keiichi's feelings of helplessness upon realising he could do nothing for his friend, who was being broken little by little and didn't seem to care. Tatarigoroshi was also the first game to tackle real-world problems in Hinamizawa (how does Rika live by herself? etc). The worst --or rather, best, from a writing standpoint-- of all is that these things happen in real life, everywhere in the world: abusive families, the inability to help a friend as they crumble down, the inefficiency of law enforcement and how it --how [i]we[/i]-- often fail to reach out and save others. It really makes you think.\n\nThe only cons I can think of are the annoying silly beginning (as always...) and some issues with the translation. I caught a few typos and inconsistencies (e.g. how they shifted from \"Dr. Irie\" to \"Irie-sensei\" all of a sudden). I assume this may have been an issue with rushed proofreading. It is nothing that should deter you from playing it though, just a pointer for the localisation team. \n\nEven so, Tatarigoroshi is my absolute favourite instalment of the Higurashi series so far. Writing is stellar, both on Satoko's heartbreaking situation, Keiichi's emotional whirlwind, and the mysterious Hinamizawa creepiness that we have already gotten used to. If you liked the previous chapters, you will certainly like this as well. If you didn't, I heavily encourage you to give it a second chance by playing this.", "timestamp_created": 1468153092, "timestamp_updated": 1468153092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587250", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24222305": {"recommendationid": "24222305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049485115", "num_games_owned": 1380, "num_reviews": 138, "playtime_forever": 1215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468120125}, "language": "english", "review": "Chapter 3: Tatarigoroshi is best played only after playing the previous two chapters in order. This kinetic visual novel does not disappoint in regards to leaving the player in a state of confusion and general ill-feeling throughout.

Personally, I enjoyed Watanagashi the most as Tatarigoroshi leaves decidedly more questions unanswered. I can understand how this would make it even more interesting for some players.\n\nPer usual, you are Keiichi Maebara, and have recently moved to the mountain village of Hinamizawa. You quickly become friends with the girls in your class. This chapter focuses on Satoko Houjou, the young prankster of the group.\n\nWhile the two previous chapters made some kind of sense to me, this third chapter hit me right between the eyes and at the end left me completely bewildered. Additional characters were introduced, previous characters were fleshed out, and some previous characters were barely covered at all (which is understandable given the attention paid to Houjou).\n\nI would highly recommend purchasing and playing this game if you enjoyed the previous two Higurashi titles!

Every release adds something, has a different flavor, and never gets boring. This one leaves even less room for setup than before, knowing that, because you played the other two chapters, it doesn't need to waste its time with introductions. By chapter 3, the plot is already in motion, and things are starting to get incredbily sad...and creepy. \n\nLet me warn you: This episode is depressing. If you can't take representations of child abuse well, then I would suggest you stay away from this. It isn't the most detailed description/situation out there, but it's enough that it gets the point across and is extremely depressing (and disturbing). So, with that out of the way, let's get into the basic plot of this chapter!\n\nBy now, we've seen two sides of the story with Rena and Mion, and now we're getting a third with Satoko. This chapter focuses on Satoko almost exclusively in the early chapters, with a lot of important characters in other chapters barely even getting a mention (Shion basically shows up for one section out of the entire experience). When Keiichi enters a club activity based on cooking (after building himself up to be a master chef, no less), he begins to learn more about Satoko, and her bond with the missing Satoshi that has been mentioned in each chapter so far. Keiichi and Satoko develop a brother-sister relationship, and days are going great until her uncle comes back from a neighboring town. I don't want to say much more than that (though with the paragraph above, I'm sure you have an idea) as not to spoil any surprises. \n\nThe only small issue I have with this chapter is that it's extremely coincidental. Sure, there have been coincidences thus far, but in this chapter it goes a little overboard with it. Suddenly, Keiichi and Satoko grow close, and characters reference how Satoko's tragedy with Satoshi means that they all must work hard to keep her smiling...all of this right before something bad happens. They build the ties specifically because of the events that follow afterwards as sort of a red flag that waves and sort of says \"HEY, BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN TO SATOKO, SO WE'RE MAKING EVERYONE TALK ABOUT HER\". It's nothing serious, it's just a bit weird that all of a sudden everyone is hung up on her when shit is about to go down. \n\nOther than that, this chapter is FULL of twists. I have already thought up many solutions to the questions thus far, and some of the events that happen in this chapter threw me back to the drawing board. The ending in particular was a shock. I never even anticipated anything like it happening in this series, and suddenly, it shifted tones (much like the characters themselves).\n\nAfter the impactful, disturbing, and extremely suspenseful ending, I am Higurashi crazy again. I bought the two manga volumes of this chapter. I'm looking up the TV drama. When Watanagashi was over, I bought Higurashi Daybreak on PSP and the DS Collectors Edition of one of the releases (in Japanese, but I wanted anything Higurashi on my shelf, even if I couldn't read it). I am almost unbelievably in love with this series at this point, even as I think I'm sarting to piece together the conclusion before it happens (there's still 5 main chapters left). \n\nSo, should you buy Tatarigoroshi? HELL YES!\n\nIf you haven't read the rest of the series, pick up Onikakushi and Watanagashi first, and get ready for a thrillride. This series doesn't disappoint on any front (characters, story, humor, creepy factor, music, art). Just please, PLEASE, read the visual novels first before you go into the other mediums. I'm reading them as they release, and after watching the anime episodes and reading the manga chapters of the three released arcs on Steam, I can say that 1/3 to 1/2 of the content is cut. Sure, all of the really important plot elements are there, but the build-up and payoff of each chapter is severly neutered. There's nowhere near the same impact. I do suggest reading them after finishing the VN chapters, but only then.\n\nAnyways, this review has gone on wayyy long. \n\nOne last note! Mangagamer, PLEASE release the other chapters as soon as you possibly can...please? You've supplied me a drug, and the longer I have to wait for the next chapter, the worse my Higurashi withdrawal symptoms will get.", "timestamp_created": 1466950623, "timestamp_updated": 1466950623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.738169", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23809224": {"recommendationid": "23809224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047059044", "num_games_owned": 945, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466898157}, "language": "english", "review": "don't talk to me or my Satoko ever again", "timestamp_created": 1466898704, "timestamp_updated": 1466898704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570699", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23702591": {"recommendationid": "23702591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087647750", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466588415}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't be fooled by the exterior; this is without a doubt one of the best horror experiences around, more comparable to a work of literature than a game.", "timestamp_created": 1466589745, "timestamp_updated": 1466589745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23700792": {"recommendationid": "23700792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080355090", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466577102}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the best chapter yet.

Ryukishi is said to have been a social worker for a time before writing Visual Novels, and in this episode you can really get a glimpse of the squalor he must have seen from his time there. The feeling of powerlessness against an injustice that thrives off bureaucracies' dogmatic adherence to regulations, the futility of going against those regulations with good intentions leading to the worst of outcomes, How people break under abuse, abandonment and betrayal. It's a very different tone from the previous works that is really heavy.\n\n\nBetween the bleakness however there are also some really emotionally stirring scenes, especially the bonding scenes between Keiichi and Satoko. The development of Keiichi and Satoko's relationship from something like friendly rivals to a love shared between siblings, paralleling her relationship with her actual brother who is missing is done really well and... The night time walking and conversations about nothing in particular, just enjoying the small periods of life where the good times knowing they won't last forever between the gang... Beautiful moments as dark rumbling machinations lurk just on the brink... You experience all the joys and terrors with them... Ryukishi finds a way to charge into your heartstrings and pulls at them, and really shows us how good he is at writing a story.\n\nThere are a few little hiccups here and there in the presentation. Music isn't as varied as it could be, though each track used is used to good effect, maybe a typo here and there (I believe I recall a her pronoun used when they were referring to a male character), and there's something about a sprite being removed, which honestly doesn't affect the overall work that much. One could say its addition served an important purpose as a characters view of another changes right at that moment, and it drives the point home, but you can still get the sentiment even with it gone I think.\n\nAll these aside, it's a really great entry into a great series.

I found this arc much less scarier but more depressing than the first two chapters, nevertheless it was pretty interesting and gives out some necessary clues to solve the mystery. The psychological view point is much more considered in this arc with the involvement of the Clinic and mental hospitals. First and foremost I think this chapter teaches a valuable lesson on how to deal if someone close to you are suffering from any type of abuse. Firstly, you need to calm yourself down no matter what it is and find out the necessary evidence to prove that the case is valid since laws could be bended by power and sometimes luck. You have to keep your wits about you. Secondly, when handling the victim you need to be cautious since they might have a lot of outbreaks depending on the type and severity of the abuse they are experiencing. Thirdly, don't do anything rash like insulting the suspects and stuff like that it might escalate more abuse on to the victim and could make the situation worse. I think those are the basic lessons taught by this arc- I might say that despite the usual goreness this arc would be sensitive to people who have gone through abuse and all sorts. So please handle this chapter carefully. Higurashi is not for people without guts. \n\nSo as usual the story is baffling and surprising- and this arc too was seen in the anime. It was genuinely atmospheric and you can feel the frustrations, depression, hatred of the main character right to your bone. The music as usual was a bit off key but that was just one soundtrack and I didn't mind that much. I've put off the graphic patch along with the voices to this arc as well and it was fabulous. The early scenarios was very boring but it started going to hell soon after. After you finish this arc you'd be sure to know that there is a slight purpose why the same thing is repeating over and over again in every visual novel you purchase. The truth is [h1]This is the GAME[/h1]. Don't be fooled that you don't have options and don't whine about it. If you purchases this and didn't play it or wanted to but just threw it away thinking \"oh it's the same thing over and over again\" then you have lost my dearies. Ryukushi07 is one hell of an author so don't underestimate him, The moment you decide that you're going to stop reading it and you won't pick it up ever. You have lost... Apparently there is even a huge mystery surrounding this whole place hinamizawa than you think. This each visual novel you read... might be a separate place who knows :P \n\nAnyways the next arc is going to be very great and I can't wait :D\nAs usual this visual novel is not meant for little kiddies okay \n", "timestamp_created": 1515678051, "timestamp_updated": 1515678051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532582", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39197513": {"recommendationid": "39197513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013571522", "num_games_owned": 674, "num_reviews": 385, "playtime_forever": 1103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514289106}, "language": "german", "review": "Nice Graphics!", "timestamp_created": 1515465787, "timestamp_updated": 1515465787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39184375": {"recommendationid": "39184375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139127613", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514313760}, "language": "german", "review": "Wieder ein neues spannendes Kapitel zum Eintauchen.\nWie auch bei den vorherigen, kann ich es nur weiterempfehlen. \n\nAm besten im Dunkeln mit Kopfh\u00f6rern.", "timestamp_created": 1515426093, "timestamp_updated": 1515426093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39173047": {"recommendationid": "39173047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262862967", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511243740}, "language": "english", "review": "Gosh I loved this game!

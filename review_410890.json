"review": "Compared to Onikakushi I found this arc slightly more vicious than the VN has procclaimed. It had more twisted psychology, violence, creepiness and mysteries surrounding than the first chapter. This chapter is also included in the anime second season I believe but it was my first time reading it.  Ofcourse regardless of saying that let me state that seriously considering the amount some people must have paid to get this VN they should have provided some good BG and voices! I think it was really unfair for the developers to devoid the PC users of that priviledge >.> Anyways the pro is you could install the PS3 graphics and voice patch to get the full required benefits. And with those two elements this visual novel is super duper great. As usual the story is bone chilling and still shocked and gave me goosebumps- it felt so nice to get into the higurashi series again such a blessing. \n\nIn this arc the main focused character would be Mion and as the other chapter verified in the All Cast Review it also focuses on the history of the demon village a bit more closely. Being in a country where the civilians are considered to be half demons well I too know that feeling. Because we are decended to be from snakes, demons and angels (LOL). The most important point is in Asian culture superstitions has a great emphasis and since collectivism still thrives around the corner many communities get bullied but the victims never rebel. Also the VN focuses a bit more on Japanese war crimes, according to my small research there were many incidents of Japanese cannibalism against US soldiers where they were consumed with a mixture of hatred and also because of the desperate need of food. The nation responsible denies them ofcourse but since it's war anything can happen. So likewise you'd learn a great deal of history from this VN especially about Japan. \n\nThe characters are still great- my all lovable and cute rena-san is still the best.Despite being a girl myself I'm such a fan of her. In the VN you would encounter many moments where the protagonist is threatened  but then you would also see how the side characters handle the exteme situations. Those are actually things that should be learn- keeping a cool head would make you see things clearler and being panicked would get you down more into a pinch. New characters were introduced into this arc to develop the story but it was kinda boring at first in every visual novel of higurashi because of the over exaggerated club games. And the same scenario keeps repeating: the watanagashi, oyashiro sama, demoned away and deaths etc. \n\nDespite the great story- the music was still unsuited for the VN at this type of development. It should be more refined. And without hesitation I did use the graphic and voice patch so it was a bit bearable. Also keep in mind that some lines won't be voiced by the characters and also I had to save my game numerously since it crashed a little bit at the early scenarios of the novel but it stopped happening in the end (my guess is you should stop chatting with friends and stop unnecessary background programs from running- but this seems illogical but idk) The story is greatly atmospheric and you totally feel like you are the main protagonist regardless of the gender. His pain is your pain and his frustrations are your frustrations. \n\nWell with all that said- still don't underestimate this VN you totally don't know what you're getting yourself into especially if you are not acquainted with the higurashi series at all, please prepare yourself. Sometimes even logic goes beyond reasoning at some point. So keep your wits about you ;)", "timestamp_created": 1515530937, "timestamp_updated": 1515530937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506742", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39197509": {"recommendationid": "39197509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013571522", "num_games_owned": 674, "num_reviews": 385, "playtime_forever": 614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514207455}, "language": "german", "review": "Nice Story!", "timestamp_created": 1515465771, "timestamp_updated": 1515465771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39184712": {"recommendationid": "39184712", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139127613", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514223376}, "language": "german", "review": "Mein liebstes Kapitel hier.

No voice acting. No nametags for text so you have to guess who is saying what. \"Textbox\" spanning over whole screen, so you have text over character sprites. Unreliable quotation marks so you cant be sure what protagonist says out loud and what he just thinks. Overall feeling this game had really low budged.\n\nAs in first VN, narrative is practicaly divided by moment when ppl start dying. That part, after first corpse turns up, is just brillant. Very tense and mystical story that wont let you walk away from screen until credits roll. \n\nFirst half of game however is weaker and i dont like it very mutch, its supposed to be comedy part where you learn about characters and have few laughs. However it wasnt very interesting to me, only thing keeping first part of game bearable was Mion/Shion plot, which was nice change compared to utterly boring first half of the first Higurashi VN.\n\nFinaly my verdict is that Higurashi - Watanagashi is very good, very intense murder-mystery VN and i like it a lot despite the low budged impression.", "timestamp_created": 1511083130, "timestamp_updated": 1511083130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36256842": {"recommendationid": "36256842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198236215590", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494753117}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the second sound novel in Hihgurashi When They Cry and honestly, it's the most confusing which is why it got an answers arc Meakashi.

The games use sound effects, images, and appropriate music to generate an atmosphere for the story. This is done much better than the last game (Yse, I know it seems almost impossible) as they have added more music that really helps to get you immersed (Cheesy though this may sound). The key characters have sprites to help you get a better idea of their appearance, and their current mood. Images tend to be scenes so you can get the idea of where the character(s) is(are).\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nLike the last chapter this game has a brilliant story, however does not directly follow up from the last chapter, it is set over the same few days where a different chain of events occur instead.\n\nThe story could be described as an emotional joyride for what kind of emotions your character feels (And that what it wants you too feel too) The character you play expresses himself in a manner of ways of goes through happiness, sorrow, hope, despair, regret, fear, feeling sympathetic towards the culprit, and what is almost love. (Though not in that order)\n\nYour character is still new to hinamizawa, however you have the knowledge of events from past chapters to take a different standpoint on events. After breaking a taboo of the village, people start to go missing, all of which had some connection to the chain of events leading up to your breaing of said taboo. Your character wants to find out what is happening, and, if possible, put a stop to it before anyone else you care about gets hurt.\n\nAs said once before the idea of this game is to put you in the character's shoes, throughout the main story you shall see what he sees, hear what he hears, know what he thinks, and (dependant on your immersion) feel what he feels.\nThe optional tips give you (The player) to learn more about the situation than your character.\n[b]NOTE: This game follows a set path, there are no choices to be made.[/b]\n\n[h1]Cost[/h1]\nFor the experiance, I'd say this game is definately worth the cost (Much like the last game.) The playtime at the time I posted this was around 16.7 hours. So in my books, chapter 2 is worth the cost as much as chapter 1 was.\n\n[h1]After Party[/h1]\nAfter you have completed the game, you unlock the \"After Party\". This is also titled as the \"All cast review session\". In it, the characters break down the 4th wall and share their opinions on the game, and their theories behind the inccidents, also discussing what the beta players thought. (A surprisingly nice way to end the game, as it somewhat doubles up as a brief recap.) It also makes some hints at preperations for the third chapter (For which I also have high expectations for.)\n\nThis game, as said above, was great. I just fell into the world they were trying to portray, even after seeing the anime, some elements of the game surprised me. (There are differences between the anime and games.)\n\nWhy are you still reading this?

It is equally ambiguous in its narrative and mysterious with its story pacing just as the first game, yet this time its revelations hold more of a chilling murder/mystery rather than a supernatural horror compared to the first game. The game is just as good though, feeding into your curiosity furthermore by presenting a storyline that doesn't fit with the timetable of events presented to us in the previous game.\n\nCompleting the first game - I detest spoilers, so I'll try to be vague as possible when it comes to plot points - it should be obvious that it is impossible for both games to be part of the same timeline. Even though, the core story elements are more or less the same with the first game - in which you are Keiichi Maebara who has just moved into the silent town of Hinamizawa and befriended a bunch of girls with quirky characters - the dynamic and events themselves in nature completely differ. Sure, we go through a sweet, careless period with girls from Keiichi's perspective; and after the night of the Watanagashi festival everything takes a turn for the creepy and mysterious. But this time we are presented with some kind of a \"what if\" scenario. This time, Keiichi isn't present during the festival, since he's been busy breaking a taboo alongside Takano Miyo, Tomitake Jiro and a newly introduced character in this arc: [spoiler]Shion Sonozaki, our beloved friend Mion's little sister[/spoiler].\n\nThis arc takes a turn to shed some light into the background of all three families leading Hinamizawa - clans Sonozaki, Kimiyoshi and Furude. Alongside many narrative details that we are already familiar with, this new game brings in a closer perspective to Sonozaki clan, [spoiler]and Sonozaki twins themselves respectively[/spoiler]. Being the second question arc in the series, it arises more questions rather than answering old ones, but the game is invaluable for its quality on introducing a thorough history of the village, including both the folklore narrative and actual historical facts, very useful to explain the local psycho-dynamic for the village.\n\nAs we've been able to observe in the first game, the narrative pacing heavily relies on sound effects, soundtrack pieces and the timing of them to be introduced with appropriate narrative sequences. Through this formula, a cheery scene may suddenly turn into an uncanny one; and a dramatic moment may suddenly turn into a full throttle horror scene. Everything within the game relies on this element of absurd consequentiality, keeping you on your toes.\n\nIt may be important to note that this storyline is a bit more brutal compared to the first one, since we have mostly observed a period of dreadful paranoia, alongside some not very closely examined murder occurrences in [i]Onikakushi[/i]. Here, we'll travel down into the belly of the beast, dealing with more death scenarios, more gore scenes and probably more psychotic monologues than necessary. I sure do love the series but I cannot handle villain monologues well, so there has been moments that I couldn't wait for someone specific to shut up... Oh, well, it ended up being satisfying in its own right anyhow.\n\nReady? Here it comes then. It's the same pattern: carefree days of youth and friendship, followed by a brutal mystery that ends up with an eerie, eerie trauma. Result? There is a village named Hinamizawa... There, weird and brutal things happen all the time. I am yet to see any kind of good ending in these series. Well, we'll see. 2 games down, 6 to go.

Like the first chapter, this one is a kinetic visual novel so there are no choices to be made-just simply read and enjoy the story.  Despite that this is the second chapter, it doesn't follow the events of the first chapter.  Rather, it kind of restarts the timeline at the beginning of the first chapter but there are alternate events that occur this time, with the focus being more on Mion and the appearance of her twin sister Shion.  Shion didn't make an appearance at all in the first chapter and then, the focus was more on Rena and getting introduced to Hinamizawa and what happens there.  Therefore, you don't really need to have played the previous chapter before playing this one although it does help as a point of reference.  \n\nBasically, this is a horror mystery game where you play as Keiichi Maebara and after the night of Watanagashi (a ceremony that takes place yearly late in June), there is one person found dead and another person who goes missing.  At least, that's what has happened in Hinamizawa for the past four years although when it happens again (this year being the fifth year), something quite different happens although I won't spoil what it is.  There are twists and turns and at the end of this game, there is a surprise twist, just like in ch.1.  If you want to know more details in regards to the story, then buy the game and find out for yourself although perhaps it might be best to wait until after my review has been completely read.  ;)\n\nSo now on to my review of Higurashi-Ch.2 Watanagashi.  I truly enjoyed the story and I liked that different events happened this time around and that I got to find out more about Mion, Shion, and their family.  The events up until the night of Watangashi are pretty tame so if you expect to be scared from the get go, that won't be the case.  This is a story where the suspense is built up but I do like that.  It makes for excellent writing, and that isn't easy to find nowadays.  The art (with the updated sprites) is beautiful and the music was varied and appropriate.  Tips are included in between chapters/days that give the reader more insight as to what's going on, as you only get a limited view when you play as Keiichi.  After you finish the game, an Extras feature is unlocked on the main menu and clicking on it gives you access to the tips as well as replay particular chapters/days.  Also, it gives you access to the after party where the characters chat and give their ideas as to what happened.  \n\nOverall, I enjoyed Higurashi-Ch.2 Watangashi and I'm excited to play Higurashi-Ch.3 Tatarigoroshi next and find out how it'll differ from the previous two chapters.  I'd recommend this game for anyone who enjoys reading a good horror, mystery story and likes built-up suspense.  Also, if you don't mind the occasional humor included here and there, then yup, definitely give this game a try.  ^^", "timestamp_created": 1489577076, "timestamp_updated": 1489577076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679900", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30353411": {"recommendationid": "30353411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098451705", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490336016}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved chapter 2.

Well, and if you want to finish the series, of course.\n\nBut I warn you, this game is almost unforgivably fluffy. You know what I mean by fluffy? I mean it's full of fluff, not a whole lot of hard substance floating around in this one and that deeply saddened me.\n\nThe beginning chapters are the absolute worst and as the name of this sequel(?) suggests, nothing of real value since the first game appears until you reach the Watanagashi festival. But when you sit through that chapter (which is chapter seven, in case you wanted to know), you feel a deeper understanding and meaning brought to the story and I just wish this second game didn't waste so, SO much time reintroducing characters we were already familiar with in the first game and force you to sit through such an agonizing (and somewhat unnecessary) teenage/pre-teen drama.\n\nMy eyes! Here! Take them! Grr! Enough is enough! Where's the story that I loved so much from the first game?! It's in chapter seven. So what do I recommend?\n\nWell, if you really want to get to the meat of this particular game, get up to the part where you meet a mysterious (new?) character with green hair. She's dressed rather cutely. After your character has a decent exchange with that (new?) character skip to the end of chapter five. I'm not joking. Just skipping to this point may take you hours (well, maybe not if you have the auto settings on high) and make sure you stop skipping when you see two of something that you thought could not possibly coexist. Then skip to chapter six and don't stop skipping until you see pictures of a shrine and from there start reading to the end. You will meet some familiar faces. Then go to chapter seven and absolutely read all of that. I won't say whether or not to keep reading or skipping from there into the remaining chapters because that is up to you (but I tell you that the story is greatly improved and interesting from chapter seven on and I honestly could not stop reading unless hunger or nature called). \n\nSo perhaps a better strategy would be to just start reading from chapter seven (and don't worry. I'm sure you'll figure out any details you might have missed in the early fluffy chapters). \n\nIn either case, buy this game if you want to know more about the mysterious story behind the cries of the higurashi-- or don't because you can't be bothered with the tremendous amount of drag the beginning chapters offer.\n\nFor me, it was really not a good idea to play this game right after the first. I probably should have let my mind simmer. You feel so ready and pumped and the writers basically send you back to kindergarten after all the knowledge you've gained. I really didn't like that. Or maybe I'm just too hard to please. Ha ha!\n\nP.S.\nI know I said I didn't condone fast-forwarding in my first review but in this second game I believe it's a must if you don't want to feel a relentless impatience for anything (absolutely ANYTHING) important to happen until chapter seven...just saying.", "timestamp_created": 1488245315, "timestamp_updated": 1497505857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642218", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30192241": {"recommendationid": "30192241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025551637", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487524910}, "language": "english", "review": "just had to \"review\" this game to show you this\nhttps://gyazo.com/9863f80fa68d5e3fc5d42f667dc452ed\nits fucking hilarious", "timestamp_created": 1488105617, "timestamp_updated": 1488105617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.402299", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29989295": {"recommendationid": "29989295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041993574", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487196735}, "language": "english", "review": "As marvelous as the first arc.

Like the first chapter, Watanahashi puts you in the role a Maebare Keichi, a normal high school student who moved to the small town of Hinamizawa in the year of 1983.\n\nLife starts in an everyday school life where and you and your friends have fun doing fun activities with your friends. That is until some mysteries about the village you are living in star to unveil and soon enough you are tangled in a mess of a situation.\n\nSo, about the story of the game, there\u2019s not much to say without spoiling the experience but  I\u2019ll say right now that after a slow start it gets amazingly fun! Without giving anything away I\u2019ll at least add the genre of the story and while it\u2019s obvious of what it is all he time, it would be something like slice of life in the beginning and after that a mix of mystery and horror.\n\nAbout graphics and all there isn\u2019t much to say about it as it is a visual novel but I think it\u2019s worth to mention that using a graphics and audio patch are a must for fully enjoying it. The standard graphics of the game are in my opinion horrible but thankfully with the patch you can use the Playstation 3 version of the graphics that are quite an upgrade and those in my opinion look great.\n\nI think I noticed a few new songs for this chapter and they were good but once again if I have one complain about the soundtrack is the same I had for the first game, one of the songs that plays when you are doing daily stuff.\n\nOverall this was a great chapter in the Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni series of visual novels. I took me 16 hours to play through all of it and I loved it from beginning to end.\n\n \nObservation: For those interested I\u2019d like to add a small comparison to the first chapter. Without spoiling anything while I thought the story was better in chapter 2, in the first one it was much creepier. There was times in chapter one I got actually scared and while it didn\u2019t happen with the same itensity in chapter 2 the story and the new information you discover about the village are much more interesting.\nOverall, I think both chapters are equally good but a bit different.\n\nThe Pros and Cons of the game for me stay the same from the first\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*]Great story, interesting mystery and captivating.\n[*]Visual are very pretty (with the fanmade patch)\n[*]Voice acting adds to the exprience (again, with the fanmade patch)\n[*]Music helps set the mood, especially in the more spooky moments.\n[/list]\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]Slow start but not as slow as the first chapter.\n[*]One particular track of the OST I don\u2019t like but it\u2019s beginning to grow on me.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1484270927, "timestamp_updated": 1484271114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28976139": {"recommendationid": "28976139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281294866", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469648798}, "language": "english", "review": "So this is the second chapter Watanagashi, which is to sum it up the story of Mion & another girl you'll get to know (I'm uncertain wether she already appeared in ch.1) I guess.\nYou'll learn more about her past and secrets, even though you still experience the whole story as keichi as in ch. 1.\n\nTo be honest, I don't know what to say.

This review is for those who are reluctant to continue after Chapter 1. \n\nI found the first chapter of Higurashi to be an overall great experience. The suspense and horror parts were written well enough to make them genuinely frightening and engaging, making up for the less interesting expository moments. The horror is still good in Chapter 2, though I found it to be less vivid and inspired than Chapter 1. The first chapter, even in its less believable parts, made an effort to put the player in the main character's perspective and managed to be fairly successful at it. Perhaps because several elements of Chapter 1 are reused, Chapter 2 feels less exciting and engrossing. The end also feels much longer than it needs to be, with several anti-climaxes making the ultimate turn of events less thrilling and more depressing. \n\nThe bigger problem this chapter suffers from is in the exposition. Whereas the build-up in Chapter 1 made the slow introduction worthwhile, Chapter 2 doubles down on the less appealing parts. The club activities are still drawn out and repetitive, and much of the first few hours feels like filler. Furthermore, the treatment of the female characters is abysmal, with even the youngest characters being treated like sex objects at times. It gives the entire first half of the game a very unpleasant atmosphere. While I realize this is an anime game from 2002, I'd really rather not read in detail about a perverted restaurant-goer attempting to get the attractive waiting staff to clean whipped cream off of his crotch. The game as a whole feels more fanservice-y than the first and detracts from the character interactions and plot. \n\nAs mentioned at the start of the review, if you loved Chapter 1, you'll still probably enjoy this chapter, but I found it to be much weaker overall.", "timestamp_created": 1481598898, "timestamp_updated": 1481598898, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460444", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28220842": {"recommendationid": "28220842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216369875", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481122440}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6700\u540e\u6740\u4eba\u90a3\u6bb5\u5b9e\u5728\u662f\u592a\u5e26\u611f\u4e86\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1481038135, "timestamp_updated": 1481038135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541244", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27576345": {"recommendationid": "27576345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083199715", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492045727}, "language": "english", "review": "buy it for Comrade K", "timestamp_created": 1480121989, "timestamp_updated": 1480121989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27553823": {"recommendationid": "27553823", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995817709", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468456648}, "language": "english", "review": "You think you're a detective type?

That means that it is more like a book with pictures, music and character sprites to illustrate and accompany the story. Unlike many other visual novels, this one does not feature any choices or different endings. \n\nIf that sounds to your liking and this is your first contact with Higurashi: DO NOT LOOK AT THE GAMES TRADING CARDS OR ACHIEVEMNTS! They contain spoilers. Especially the Trading Cards descriptions. Oh, and play Onikakushi before you play this.\n\nActual review: While I would definitely recommend Higurashi Ch. 2 to anyone, who is not turned away by this review's first paragraph, I feel that Ch.1 was a bit better. Watanagshi still delivers the promised horror, spine-tingly goose bumps and murder/conspiracy mistery. And towards the end it gets very, very dark! \n\n- pacing is not as good as Onikakushi's\n- one of the new music tracks seems to be of lower quality than the others\n- said track plays during one of the big reveals and was utterly unfitting\n- sometimes,  character sprites seemed to have the wrong facial expressions, also why aren't the ones with the different eyes from Onikakushi used?\n\n+ starts with a minor mistery, that actually had me thinking all the way through: is S really S and is M really M?\n+ some great plot twists\n+ Detective Rena is absolutely badass adorable!\n+ Holy crap did the ending scare me!\n\nSince I'm having a really hard time writing anything more without spoilers, I'll keep it at that and hope you will have as much fun as I did with this visual novel. I'm already looking forward to Ch.3.\n\n\n\n\"Huh...... hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee ... \"", "timestamp_created": 1478306093, "timestamp_updated": 1478306299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26336657": {"recommendationid": "26336657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037972002", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477915823}, "language": "french", "review": "Tout simplement excellent.

Now that that delightful tidbit is out of the way, this arc is important for providing us with several keys to the mystery. Some background on Hinamizawa is given, along with details about the worship of Oyashiro-sama. Random fact: in the Shinto religion, the spilling of blood is considered a form of pollution and unclean. Now, this part is creepy enough for Americans, but to the Japanese, this is pretty much blasphemy a la [i]Children of the Corn[/i]. Fun fact over. \n\nThe girl of this route is Mion, the game club leader, and we are introduced to her twin sister, Shion, which provides an answer to the question of [spoiler]how Mion knew Keiichi met with Oishi at the Angel Mort restaurant[/spoiler]. Along the way, we learn about the history of the Sonozaki family's role in Hinamizawa, and get an interesting glimpse at a character we barely got to know in [i]Onikakushi-hen[/i]. It's rather...interesting. Can you figure out what is going on?\n\nSo, this arc brings up some interesting questions about just what is going on here.

Whether this admission is worthy of forgiveness is the main source of suspense.\n\t[*][b]Mion (character)/character development[/b] --- Ch. 2 does a far better job at balancing setting establishment and character development in regards to its central character, who in this case is Mion. This is partly due to the village's history being integrated into her story rather than being a separate element as was the case with Rena in the previous chapter.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n[list]\n\t[*][b]Pacing[/b] --- It's expected that the reader is familiar with the characters established in the first chapter, so this one takes less time to set the stage.

Ch. 2 reels back the psychological horror element from Ch. 1 and becomes more of a slasher. The main character is not alone for this journey. During moments where he would have previously wrestled with his inner doubts on whether he could trust the friend standing beside him, this time he reaches out for help. Seeing it all unfold is only part of the excitement as the highlight of this chapter will come in the last few scenes when everything is thrown into question and the reader must struggle to make sense of what they actually experienced.\n\nNovel length is roughly [b]9 hours[/b] depending on reading speed.

So, to lay out the pros and cons in relation to Ch1:\n\nPros (aka. the reason why I do recommend this): \n- The beginning doesn't feel as slow, and it's also a little more entertaining.\n- You get to understand some characters' intentions a little better (I'm looking at you, Ooishi).\n- The sound during creepy/suspense moments is soooo much better.\n- More of the history of Hinamizawa.\n- In case you like Mion as much as I do, you get to see plenty of her backstory here as well.\n\nCons (aka. critique time! May be a little long and spoilery, so be warned):\n- It feels like this had a \"broader\"/more general point of view, focusing on what's going on with everybody and having Keiichi try to find out what happened to other people in these larger-scale incidents, making this more about mystery than psychological horror. Onikakushi, on the other hand, focused on both Rena's and Keiichi's mental breakdowns. The narrative had you at the edge of your seat much more often than Watanagashi. After all, it [i]does[/i] have a bigger impact when you read first-person descriptions of somebody stalking and trying to kill you than when you read a character talking about some other people who died.\n- Keiichi's character in this also made the end really lukewarm, in my opinion. His unconditional acceptance and near-blind trust in Mion made the horrible things at the end seem much more distant than his constant paranoia and fear of Rena (his development in both chapters is understandable, however).\n- The emphasis on gender roles and stereotypes for the first half of the game is SO ANNOYING.\n\nAlso, a little tip: you may think the \"after party\" is just a little extra, but I do recommend reading it. Characters get together as if they were actors just playing their roles and discuss the story, which may help you mull it over as well. I admit I had found the end to be incredibly underwhelming (especially in comparison to Onikakushi), but the after party shed light on some things I hadn't considered. I guess the generic writing at the start of each chapter really had me underestimating the writers...", "timestamp_created": 1466850201, "timestamp_updated": 1466978647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525370", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23779860": {"recommendationid": "23779860", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033457474", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466026956}, "language": "english", "review": "Watanagashi is like a different author writing a slightly altered version of Onikakushi, with the focus of much of the story on Mion instead of Rena. It has the same plodding pace in the first 4 or so chapters, same low budget get's-the-job-done backgrounds, and adds a single character. For the most part this can be \"played\" on its own, but many of the nuances of the characters, as well as a few references in the opening chapters and music changes (every time the music stops, that creeping dread comes in...). There is much more plot resolution in this chapter than in the previous one, but also raises a lot of questions (it took me about 2 hours to read the final chapter, and it just keeps throwing stuff at you).\n\nUltimately, I highly recommend this second chapter. It feels to be more informational than mysterious, as with the first chapter, and provides a lot of background information, especially about Mion.

This ruined the mystery for me once I found out who the culprit was as the main character was still \u2018not accepting\u2019 the \u2018person\u2019, it got a little frustrating. Although, it is a still a great read, but I do prefer the first novel. \n\n[b]Sound: 6/10[/b]\nApart from a few different soundtracks here and there, it does borrow the same soundtrack heard from the first novel. They did not improve it in any way of form, but they also didn\u2019t change it too drastically that it would mismatch the novel. \n\n[b]Gameplay: 9/10[/b]\nSame deal with the first novel, you get the exact same options. In addition, there were no translation errors that I spotted which is a plus. However, as with the first novel the game crashed a few times, so make to save often to avoid losing progress. \n\n[b]Price: 10/10[/b]\nWith a base price of \u00a35.59 it is worth significantly more than the first novel for nearly the same length.

[strike]O m\u00e1s xD La verdad es que no lo he comprobado.[/strike]\n\n[*][b]A pesar de todo esto y que no se puede interactuar de ninguna manera con la historia... \u00bfLa recomiendas?:[/b] S\u00ed, y mucho. Sobre todo si te gusta el misterio o una trama oscura. La historia, a mi parecer, es muy buena, la m\u00fasica es incre\u00edble (en este cap\u00edtulo aparecen algunas pistas de audio nuevas y son una pasada), los nuevos sprites est\u00e1n bastante bien y el juego de por s\u00ed intenta manipular tu percepci\u00f3n... \u00a1Puede hacerte creer cosas hasta el punto de estar seguro que luego te desmoronar\u00e1!  No puedo prometerles que les pase eso... Pero es algo que me sucedi\u00f3 en muchas ocasiones a lo largo de toda la saga... Es lo que pasa cuando tomas la postura de un detective (?) Que es de lo que va todo esto.\n\n[*][b]En cualquier caso, \u00bfno ser\u00eda m\u00e1s sencillo ver el anime o leer el manga?:[/b] No, no lo creo. Tanto el anime como el manga dejan mucha informaci\u00f3n fuera y habr\u00e1 cosas que nunca llegar\u00e1s a entender del todo. Esto lo s\u00e9 de primera mano porque es lo que yo hice antes de probar el juego y ahora que lo hago, me doy cuenta de todas las cosas que me perd\u00ed o que no entend\u00eda. Hay que tener en cuenta que el juego es el recurso original del que se han sacado todas las dem\u00e1s adaptaciones (inclu\u00eddo un live action que apenas tiene sentido), por lo tanto, jugarlo siempre va a ser la mejor opci\u00f3n. Por otro lado, suponiendo que quisieras hacerlo de forma legal (?), te saldr\u00eda MUCH\u00cdSIMO m\u00e1s caro comprar los tomos del manga que comprar todas las partes del juego. Vamos, yo creo que son todo ventajas.\n[/list]\n\u00bfSigues indeciso? Igual puedes echarle un ojo al manga y ver si te podr\u00eda interesar. Aseg\u00farate tambi\u00e9n de mirar las valoraciones del primer cap\u00edtulo, puesto que contienen mucha informaci\u00f3n valiosa para entender si puede ser la experiencia que buscas.\n\nSi me preguntas a m\u00ed, merece la pena.", "timestamp_created": 1462650161, "timestamp_updated": 1462650319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566667", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22831782": {"recommendationid": "22831782", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033059449", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462196641}, "language": "english", "review": "If you've played Onikakushi then you should know what to expect.

It's not bad but it's nowhere near the spook level of the first chapter, Onikakushi, which builds up to the bad scenes very well. This review's for the second chapter though so let me get to that..\n\nI feel like it's really difficult to read through much of this without having to take a long break before wanting to read it again. Some days it's nice to sit in silence and just read with some background music, but I felt like it was missing voices and the build up to the horrifying secrets of Hinamizawa. It leaves you desiring something more, and it doesn't have the same chilling effect. Highly recommend reading Ch.1 Onikakushi first, regardless.\n\nI would have liked if there was an option for alternative endings or at least SOME sort of thing that allowed you to choose between answers of what to do, as I feel that would have made it a fair bit more interesting as well. It just seems odd having one ending and nothing to play upon.\n\nAlso, be sure to download the voice (and graphics, if you so choose) patch if you want the story to be a little more interesting to follow. Since that unfortunately didn't come with the games, I'd probably give this a 7/10.

I had more issues with lines in Watanagashi than I did in Onikakushi, however, overall, MG did a good job.\n-Music!! !! ! It only gets better from here on out.\n-Honestly? There was a lot of hate being spread around the internet regarding the new sprites. While I do dislike some (which is only natural), I think MOST look great; I am particularly fond of Rena's, Shion's, and Takano's. If you dislike the new sprites, the game contains an option to use the original Sprites (which are hilarious yet endearing in their own way).\n\nI'm not sure at what speed MG intends to release Higurashi, but I hope they do so at a decent speed so we aren't waiting years to finish reading the Steam release.

Regardless, it's still an interesting, attention-grabbing and suspenseful story that's highly recommended to anyone who read the first chapter, has seen the anime or is a general horror fan (starting with Onikakushi is pretty much essential due to the way the story is structured)\n\nThe story kept my attention throughout and has been practically marathoned as I wasn't able to stop until it was over.\nHowever, it did have a few flaws that impacted its enjoyment.\nI found a number of character actions, mainly of the narrating protagonist, to be unrealistic and highly irrational. I understand that emotion and impulse heavily affected his choices and motives, but some of the decisions he makes near the vn's end as well as ways in which he reacts to what's going on seemed highly unbelievable and far from what any human being would do, no matter the situation or their feelings towards others involved. [spoiler]Who in their right mind would show so much sympathy towards a recently revealed mass murderer and follow her into the secluded crime scene alone? Or go outside at night to meet her after she tried to torture them to death? If I was Keiichi, I would feel nothing but disgust and resentment towards Mion. The vague \"demon\" explanation for her actions didn't feel like enough to change my view of her as a character in this arc, and the concept of heartbreak caused by Rena being given the doll in no way justified her development as a character/sadistic murderer[/spoiler]\nAnother issue I felt was present in this game, which was more apparent than in the first, was the repetitiveness of music at certain points, especially during longer scenes when the same track would loop many times despite my reasonably fast reading.\n\nThose points asside, I still highly recommend the game and appreciate the good translation as well as vastly improved character art.", "timestamp_created": 1453147378, "timestamp_updated": 1453147535, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20611268": {"recommendationid": "20611268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002522469", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453145954}, "language": "english", "review": "He was killed because I told him.\nHe was killed because he found out.\nI confessed everything...so he was killed.", "timestamp_created": 1453146564, "timestamp_updated": 1453146564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20606037": {"recommendationid": "20606037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068924458", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492315163}, "language": "english", "review": "God damn it whens the third installment coming out", "timestamp_created": 1453128885, "timestamp_updated": 1458628319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.334217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20595196": {"recommendationid": "20595196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025913007", "num_games_owned": 336, "num_reviews": 101, "playtime_forever": 711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452325690}, "language": "english", "review": "I was surprised when I played this game.  I was expecting either a prequel or a sequel to the first game but this is neither.  Each chapter in the Higurashi series tells the same story, with a number of subtle things changed around to yield different events and outcomes.  Apparently there are four such chapters, with those that come after explaining the mystery behind the previous stories.  So far, it seems like you could play the chapters in either order, but I suspect they will have more impact if you play them in the numbered order and that was probably the intention of the developer.\n\nGiven how the series is set up, if you're reading this review and have played the first chapter already, you may be iffy about wanting to go through the same story again.  But although the characters and setting are the same, most of the minor events and major plot points are different, and it gives you more insight into what might be going on in the town.  In fact, it's different enough that it almost feels like someone wrote two different novels with the same premise, setting, and characters.  Only a few things stay the same, and I had no idea what was going to happen until it was all over, even though I had read the first chapter.\n\nIf you've played the first chapter, buy this too.  If you haven't and are interested in the Higurashi series, start with the first one.\n\nIn terms of the writing, I still think too much time is being spent on the cringe-worthy anime slice of life stuff.  I understand that it is needed to help us get invested in the characters and to contrast with the actual seriousness of the plot, but it is still very badly written.  I watch a lot of anime, and I've never seen slice of life writing that made me cringe as much as the stuff in Higurashi.  But maybe that is because of the story's main character?

If anything, it only heightened the sense of dread because I knew exactly how messed up this would turn out.\n\nWatanagashi introduces a new character, but also heavily involves the cast that you met before, with Mion in particular standing out. While much is similar to Onikakushi, much is different as well - particularly how things turn out in the end. Even so, if you have played the first chapter (and you should), then you have some idea where this is headed. Except... you don't.\n\nAnnnd... I think that's all I will say because spoilers. But the gist of it is... I liked Watanagashi quite alot. More than Onikakushi, though that might just be because of my bias towards the \"answer arc\" for this, Meakashi, which is probably my favorite part of the entire series. Can't wait for that, or really the rest of the series to be honest. I hope they can release them faster. :o\n\nAnyway, if you have played Onikakushi... play this too. Right now.

In this VN, you're basically reading a novel with pictures, backdrops, music and sound effects thrown in for good measure. I think it makes good use of those elements to help sell the story by setting the mood for the reader, but your results may vary. \n\nI enjoyed the anime series a while ago, and I continue to enjoy these VNs as they come out. They flesh out the anime's story which came out at a breakneck speed. On this 'replay', I also have to credit the writers on how far ahead they thought about certain story elements while using misdirection. I don't want to spoil the storybecause that's part of the fun of murder mystery stories.\n\nLast time, I wrote down a list of Things I Learned in Hinamizawa. My list was considerably longer, but I narrowed it down to the ten I thought would best fit the events of the game and my impressions.\n\n- Learn to see things from other people's point of view, or risk exploitation when they use this ability against you.\n- Keep fighting until the last minute. \"As soon as you give up, it's all over.\"\n- It is just as important to talk about your feelings as it is hard to do so. \n- When you are trying to patch things up with someone, don't assume everything is alright just because you are on speaking terms again.\n- Ghost stories will never go out of fashion, for better or worse.\n- Do not underestimate mankind's capacity for cruelty to what he deems less than himself.\n- Lying is much harder than telling the truth. You can't keep the fake facts straight forever\n- Someone else might have to pay the price for your mistake, even when you really want to take responsibility for it. \n- You might not like what you find, but you must always persue the truth\n- Sometimes a person really is too far gone to help.

The story feels larger this time. Also we get to know more aspects about the characters and the village Hinamizawa. As a fan of the anime adaptation, I enjoyed this chapter a lot, discovering all the minute but interesting details that were omitted in the anime.\n\nIn summary:\n\nPros:\n+The twins theme of Mion/Shion is brilliantly explored. Depending on the context, the writing is funny, entertatining, or horrifying. Also, the twins theme echos well with the duality theme of village Hinamizawa (the bright and dark sides of the village).\n+The pacing has been improved. The last chapter has a very slow and sometimes boring start, featuring numerous club activities that have little contribution to the main plot. Not this time. The main story starts rather early on. Also, the story progresses smoothly, compared to the last chapter.\n+New background music an better BGM switching.\n+Sound effects are utilized better.  \n+Rena still rocks!\n\nCons:\n-The reader will be introduced to the curse of Oyashiro-sama in a boring exposition... for the second time ... as if we hadn't got enough in the last chapter.\n-The thoughts of the protagonist are written in a really repetitive fashion.\n-Although this is chapter dedicated to the character Mion, I cannot find any new portraits for Mion (aside from Shion of course), which is really disappointed.\n\nOverall, I strongly recommend buying it at full price.

If you loved Onikakushi (I know I did), then you're sure to love this one as well. If you haven't read through Onikakushi, go pick it up for a few dollars. Trust me, it's money well spent. Watanagashi gets into the mystery a little faster than Onikakushi did, since it doesn't have to establish characters as much as the first chapter did. However, there is a new character in this one, so still expect plenty of set-up before the madness begins. Also, the story this time around is a bit less mysterious. Onikakushi ended on a really weird note (trust me, this one does too), but having the knowledge from the first chapter really seems to make puzzle pieces fit a bit better. Overall, though, still plenty of mystery to go over, and you get a MUCH more detailed look into the past of Hinamiza. Trust me, it isn't pretty.\n\nThe only negatives I can give this game are a few typos here and there, but with work this dense, that's always going to happen. It's not something a patch can't fix either!\n\nOh, and in case you are new to this series and are on this page, Higurashi has no interaction when it comes to gameplay. I see so many people getting upset that it doesn't have branches, but honestly, there's so much mystery here that you're sure to play it through more than once! I know I am! Trust me, it's still worth it even without the choices.\n\n10/10 \nJust fantastic.

mind f**k. There were many moments where I was absolutely stunned and could do nothing but sit in disbelief with my mouth agape.\n\nHigurashi when they cry - Watanagashi Is the second chapter in the Higurashi series. The basic premise is that: protagonist Keiichi Maebara recently moved to a small village named Hinamizawa in the countryside. The story starts about a month after he moved to the village and he had just gotten settled in.\nSince this is the 2nd chapter, less time is spent introducing the reader to the world and characters.\nThe mood start off happy and light hearted to get the reader invested in the characters, then gradually become sinister.\n\n[olist]\n[*] [b]Story & Characters:[/b] Though the story is faster paced compared to Onikakushi, it still unfolds quite slow. It wasn't so slow to bore me. In fact, I think it's better for it. Because the story develops slowly and has a lot of Slice of Life moments during the opening chapters, It forces you to become closely attached to the characters. This make the later half of the story all the more brutal. Because the characters are so relatable. Their interactions were enjoyable to read about, and often hilarious. I got so invested in the characters that bad things happening to the characters were pretty upsetting.\n\nThe writing is great. Almost everything written about has a deeper meaning, if you were to re-read the story, you would see lots of clues hiding in plain sight. This is the kind of story where you aren't given a concise answer to the mystery, and the reader is supposed to look at the clues and come up with their own theory as to what the answer to the mystery is. (However, there is a \"correct\" answer). There are also many red herrings, so you are sometimes getting thrown off.\n\n[b]Story: 9/10[/b]\n\n[*] [b]Art & Graphics:[/b] The art style of the sprites looks good. The characters all have interesting designs. However my complaint is that often, the sprite doesn't match the descriptions of the characters facial expressions. [url=http://i.imgur.com/wIDaY8Y.png]This[/url] Is apparently Rena with an intense stare XD. This is common with most of the characters. However it isn't a huge deal.\nAnother complaint, is the background images are just photographs put through a filter to appear more... cartoonish/cell shaded? Anyway, when Onikakushi released on steam, it didn't take a month before someone released a mod which used the PS3 Sprites and Backgrounds. They will likely release a similar mod for Watanagashi.\n\nOne of the major issues, is the way the text is displayed. In most visual novels, the text appears in a text box at the bottom of the screen, and is usually titled with the speakers name. However, in Higurashi, The text takes up large portions of the screen, often covers the sprites and doesn't show the speakers name. Sometimes you don't know who is saying what. It becomes less of a problem later on. Because each character has a unique ways of speaking. But still, it can be really confusing. I hope to see a UI mod in the future.\n\n[b]Art: 7/10[/b]\n\n[*] [b]Music & Sound:[/b] The music is well made. The music does it's job, and can be atmospheric. During some of the creepy moments, you almost don't notice the music. The visual novel is so immersive, it all blends together. The music is pretty catchy, and I never found the music to get boring. Most of the tracks loop seamlessly.\nThe sound effects are used really well. They added a lot to the atmosphere along with the music. On more than one occasion I even jumped. I also was legitimately creeped out and glanced behind me a couple of times. It's great to read after midnight.\n\n[b]Music & Sound: 7.5[/b][/olist]\n\nOverall, this chapter is slightly better than the last. The last chapter had more Slice of Life content, and this one had more disturbing, s**t hitting the fan moments. As stated earlier, the pacing is faster. So if the pacing of the first one bored you, this one should be a more interesting read. Though, it still takes quite a while to get started. So if you are an impatient reader, and don't want to invest a few hours into a story before it kicks into full gear, then this visual novel may not be for you. Most people agree that the Higurashi Visual Novels are better than the anime (I share this opinion). However, if you are the impatient type, I would recommend buying the anime instead. As the Anime is still quite good. You can usually get the DVD from Ebay, or Amazon at a fair price. \n\n[b]Visual Novel Length: 15-20 hours[/b]\n\n[b]Overall: 8/10[/b] Would write a review longer than that which I am reviewing again XD.", "timestamp_created": 1447744917, "timestamp_updated": 1447834914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621366", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19125547": {"recommendationid": "19125547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108914256", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454365783}, "language": "english", "review": "I've always loved this series so i'm a bit biased here.\nthis one is a bit more expencive than the first chapter but i asume it's do to it being a longer story than the first chapter.\nyou'll find more about the watanagashi festival in this arc and much more if you pay close enough attention and don't get thrown off by red herrings.\nGlad Umineko got a release too ^.^", "timestamp_created": 1447744301, "timestamp_updated": 1479940525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582952", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19125116": {"recommendationid": "19125116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165315684", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447781988}, "language": "english", "review": "Do I recommend it? DO I RECOMMEND?! 1000% yes I do. Even at the slight price jump, this chapter is worth it. \n\nThis VN was an emotional roller coaster for me. The writing got better here then in Onikakushi. The story starts out as a fun humorous experience in the vein of Gintama I'd say with some of the ridiculousness. It then subtly lays the ground the plot ahead, but while it does this, at the midway point it kind of drags. After this midway point, you move onto the mystery part of the story. After this I cried. A lot. I've seen the anime and know the series plot already and all its secrets so maybe it made me cry because I knew what was to come. But the writing for the emotions of Keichi could not be captured like how an anime could try. His personal struggle with each event was heart wrenching. While it was limited to a single perspective unlike the anime (which showed more of the truth), it did a better job of conveying a story and the emotion behind it. The reused bgms still feel a little out of place and cheap imo, but the new ones that play late in the VN fit the mood perfectly and make it all the more emotional. This VN is simply wonderful and probably the best to come onto Steam.\n\n11/10 - Would cry like a little pussy again", "timestamp_created": 1447740416, "timestamp_updated": 1447740416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.715638", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19124144": {"recommendationid": "19124144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080355090", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466289324}, "language": "english", "review": "WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR CHAPTER 1, ONIKAKUSHI.

The original music is fully intact as it was in the original release nearly 13 years ago.\n[*] Like CH1, the translation quality of this release far surpasses the 2009 MG localization or the various fanslation projects, owing to MangaGamer's decision to retranslate this behemoth from scratch.

Alternatively, those who prefer the original art have the option to switch between the two on the fly by pressing 'P'. Going even further beyond these options, MangaGamer's intentional decision to allow modding of Higurashi's graphic assets means that discerning fans can even go as far as using the PS2 character sprites, or the PS3 backgrounds, or even custom fanmade sprites.

The two other games above were the usual PUBG and CSGO.\n\nNeedless to say, this made me INSTANTLY hit the \"purchase this game\" button, and to be honest, this was the best decision I made in my entire life... after I quit smoking! \n\nWhen I say that this game makes all the other games obsolete, it's because it REALLY does. Nothing comes close to Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and I've had my fair share of video games.\n\nI was so mesmerized by the quality of this game, that I didn't even leave a review on Steam...\n\nInstead, I took a pen and I wrote a REAL letter to thank the marvelous team in Czech Republic, because it would have been a grotesque insult to leave a banal online review for this unique piece of art!\n\nAnyways, the reason I made this post is simply because Kingdom Come: Deliverance is the ONLY game that managed to REVIVE my interest in video games.

That being said I expected nothing more than \"Oh look boobs\" from this game and honestly I can say I am pleasantly surrprised by what I got. While there is an uncensored to reinforce my initial thoughts of \"Just another Ero VN game\" there is an actual story to be had here and apparently a lot of content to see and read through.\n\nMy first playthrough took several hours -I had to walk away from my computer for a while- and I got Ending #20 so that alone tells me there's enough to see to justify another run. The game can end quickly or go on for a while based on decisions you make in the game and I'm not going to spoil anything for anyone, but I will give some fair warning. This game can get a bit dark. Still fun, but depending on some decisions made in game, can get dark.\n\nI could honestly make this a long and thorough reveiw, but I would just end up repeating myself and running on so I would rather settle for the traditional pros and cons. I break VN games down into 5 categories unless something unique happens The Story obviously, The Characters, The Pacing, The Music and The Art.\n\nCONS:\nThe music -The music is fine, far from the best, but passable. The reason I list it as a con is it seems to cut before it should, but that may be an issue with my PC so let's say this is a middle ground.\nSTART-UP -The game does not start off great, it starts off rather dull. Its kind of like \"Get past the first few episodes and your set\" deal. If you can make it past the first two-three days in game you'll be good\n\nPROS: \nTHE ART -While not the best I've ever seen is acceptable and I don't mean the character pictures I mean the background, the characters themselves are subpar at best.\nTHE CHARACTERS -They seem one dimensional at first and even a little cliche they are well written and as the game progresses they show depth and emotion that make them actual characters and not B-list cut outs.\nTHE STORY -If you get a summary of the story you will not expect it to be good, you just won't, but once you start and get past the first few steps you'll realize how good it could get. You won't get sucked in or really immersed in it, but it is enjoyable. Though it can take a long time or it could be over quickly based on decisions made.\n\nUltimately I honestly cannot recommend this game enough, while I do realize not everyone has my level of enjoyment out of visual novels this would be one I recommend because of how it can turn out and all the things that could happen. Obviously replaying it just to see everything can very easily and just as quickly become repetitive and tedious, but for the first few times I think it would be worth it. I do think this game is worth it, it is far more than it's initial appearance my suggest and BurstRay Games really hit the nail on the head with this one.", "timestamp_created": 1512969436, "timestamp_updated": 1512969436, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37986630": {"recommendationid": "37986630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010177928", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512411794}, "language": "english", "review": "I very good visual novel. \nLot of replayabiliy too. \nReal choices.\nNo regrets at all ! :)", "timestamp_created": 1512163400, "timestamp_updated": 1512163400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37387889": {"recommendationid": "37387889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219722469", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511504301}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game.", "timestamp_created": 1511546825, "timestamp_updated": 1511546825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37362169": {"recommendationid": "37362169", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194218175", "num_games_owned": 425, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512275630}, "language": "spanish", "review": "No estoy muy metido en las novelas visuales, ya que la mayoria que he jugado se me hacen lentas y muy largas como para seguir jugando a los diez minutos de haber empezado, sin embargo en army gals eso no paso y es por eso que tengo que darle el merito, ademas tiene uno de los mejores personajes que he visto en toda mi vida (Raen).

When he gets there, he meets three other delinquents stuck in the same situation as him, timid Andrea, no-nonsense Edda, and sex-crazed Raen. When the group's counselors leave and never come back, they realize they are stuck in the woods and now must find their way back to civilization. But surviving and getting out will not be an easy task.\n\nThis game is a visual novel, a type of video game that is more about reading than traditional gameplay. Along the way, there are numerous choices offered to the player that affect the course of the story. In total, there are a whopping twenty-one different endings to achieve.\n\nThe art in the game is okay at best. Being a visual novel, the characters mostly stick to a traditional anime-style. However, even within that style, the characters and other elements are notably plain looking with flat colors and a lack of detail. I was also disappointed with how often assets are reused for different scenes. I can understand reusing forest backgrounds since much of the story takes place in it, but several other examples just seems lazy like the use of a cabin interior for multiple locations.\n\nThe music is only okay at best, as well. There are only a few soundtracks so repetition quickly becomes the norm. I found this to often be more irritating than a good addition to the game.\n\nAs with any visual novel, the main attraction would be the story and writing. I will admit that I decided to try out this game because some reviews said it has an interesting story and is not just about the hentai material. Unfortunately, I found this not to be the case. To start, I did not really find any of the characters very interesting. I think it would have improved the game greatly if there was a lot more attention paid to character development. It seems there was an attempt to give each main character a personality and background, but it never feels as if it is very fleshed out. For instance, it is implied with Raen that she has had some troubles in her past that cause her bizarre behavior in the present. This would have made a great point to expand upon. Instead, she is portrayed as someone with some kind of hypersexual disorder and seems to ask for sex every five minutes. This feels like little more than lame wish-fulfillment that is not interesting and just becomes very tired as the game progresses.\n\nI was also disappointed with the tone in general of the story. Even after it becomes apparent in the story how dire their situation is, it still feels as though the game cannot decide whether to take itself seriously or not. There are some scenes, which I will avoid detailing to avoid spoilers, that seem to stray a little too far from the established reality the game takes place in and which ultimately feel out-of-place.\n\nI will admit there are a few jokes that I found funny in the game and I do laud the writers for the ambition of creating a visual novel with twenty-one endings.\n\nAs has been said, available on the developer's website is a free patch available to play the uncensored version. If not for the story, then I would assume that is one of the primary reasons most will play this game.\n\nPerhaps I went into this with the wrong expectations. I was hoping for a game with an interesting storyline and decent characters, but I found one with shallow writing and gratuitous nudity.

The title is a bit misleading a  ill admit but it more than makes up for it in the storyline. The character seems to change his attitude alot depending on your choices so it actually feels like everytime you do a diffrent path you act a bit diffrently. The art is great and stays true to the screenshots. The characters all have their own personal backstories that make you feel more connected and trying to find all the details in diffrent situations made me more interested in a replay. There is tons of variety in the choices you make and they can lead to some weird and interesting things (yay fairy field). \n\nThe music is a little iffy for me personally. There were some scenes where I think I was lying next to a girl and shes just talking about stuff and this really ominous music plays and other times where the music doesn't fit at all to what we are talking about. The music is also a little scant and could use a bit more variety and the background scenes are really awesome but after a while they seem to be reused alot. There is also one point where im lying with all the girls pretty much clad in nothing and ill talk to one (like you do every night) and it will switch to them fully clothed and the text will say their walking to their tent and just seemed a bit off to me or I could be remembering it wrong.\n\nOne of the smaller things that bugged me a little was a few pictures in the gallery of one of the girls where her face just seemed so weird like nothing what she looks like in-game. Another when you in the dungeon and her facial features and stuff just didn't sit right with me but that's just personal opinion. \n\n-This is a bit of a spoiler so if you want to get everything don't read this.-\nAt the end of the game you have to accuse someone and you can't just stay silent or anything. At that point I was romancing Andrea and I felt like I did a pretty good job and then she told me she loved me and whatever and my character didn't have a choice in turning her in or not and he just handed her over. I feel like that was really a situation that could of been better it feels like you have to get a lot of things right to get a ending you want. That didn't really sit well with me becuase as far as I know some of those situations are in a direction you have to choose so if you choose the wrong direction you don't get the ending. Even if you could just choose don't turn in and get a middle ending like friends who grow apart or something.\n\nI've only gotten like 10 or 15ish endings so there could be some lee way but it seems alot of the time ill just choose whatever direction and do whatever I can to get a girl to like me and at the end it will mostly turn bad. At one point I used a guide for a specific ending and it said a crucial point for endings are the directions and for me I thought that was irritation because that choice doesn't have anything to do with a girl or her personal likes/dislikes and so shouldn't reserve so many endings.\n\noverall I would recommened this game because it is well priced and gives pretty much exactly what it says it does.

With that said, I've been trying out some of Dharker Studio's games, and have come quite fond of them. Which is the main reason I'm doing this review, not just because I enjoyed this game, but pretty much all of them that I've played so far. I hope Dharker Studio continues to do such a great job and continues to put out many games to come.\n\nPros:\n-Nice art\n-Many choices\n-Many endings\n-Amazing story\n-Price\n-Difficulty (The game isn't too easy, as in, the choices aren't always obvious. I actually had to work to figure out how to get with the girls instead of the choice being easy. To me this is a plus, whats the point in giving options if there is only one obvious choice, right?)\n-Replay value (I've played through the game several times now and have about 7 hours played, still haven't unlocked all the achievements nor seen all the endings.)\n-Has an adult patch (This is just a personal preference of mine, I've been a gamer all my life, MMO's and FPS games do not censor their violence, which we all enjoy. So why censor nudity? I just think its lame to do so, so I'm cool with seeing the original uncensored adult content, which I think makes these games even better.)\n-Gallery (Not only just the pics but also the vids as well, first time seeing that in a game, that I recall. Nice feature.)\n\nCons: (I really don't have anything negative to say about the game, but to be fair to those who read this, I wanted to give a heads up.)\n-No voice acting (To me it didn't take away from the game, but it would have made for a nice feature to those who enjoy it.)\n-Music (Sadly the music isn't that great, but at the same time its not overly dramatic either, so good and bad.)\n\nAnd that about wraps it up. I can see me playing through the game some more to see if I can get the rest of the endings and achievements. When I'm finished with this one, I'm going to buy another Dharker Studio game, I really hope they continue to produce such great games and often.

There are few, but they all have their distinct characteristics.\nTrust me, especially the three gals, are rendered astonishingly well, and you will end up loving them because of how they are more than how they look.\n+Very well written story, i actually enjoyed the story a lot, especially because of a very big secret and surprise that i won't spoil you. It'd be a crime.\n+Good character art. Definitely liked the art style for the three gals.\n+Lots of endings, some good, some bad, and you really have to keep trying to get the ending you want. Trust me, it won't always go like you planned.\n+Realistic? Yes. But they throwed up a few nonsense stuff inside that... Well... You have to see it...\n+The dialogue feels good and quite real, actually. These gals won't fuck you randomly just 'cause you asked. At least, two of them won't.\n+The uncensored patch is a must. Bonus points for keeping it free. Noted. \n+Well written. Only two grammar errors spotted. Unless you're really paying a lot of attention, your brain will skip right through them.\n\nSo, there are a lot of pros. But what about the\n\nCONS\n\n-The backgrounds are reused way too often. There could've been more of them, especially because they get reused in the same scene pretty often.\n-There is a particular scene being really awkward, where a night conversation will take place in the wrong location. Probably  a dev oversight, but it won't be easy to fix, as the game would need another entire night to be added. \n-Would've liked a bit more choices that could influence my reputation with the girls. Sure, the choices are solid right now, but sometimes they ask something and you're railroaded to one answer. Not a large issue, and went unnoticed for the first runs.\n-Less H-Scenes than how many there actually are, leaving those to text description. \nSince the patch is free, tho, i'll give this one less points. \n\n------------------------\nVerdict\n\n\nArmy Gals is a very good VN, and i whole heartedly recommend it. \nYou' get affectionated to the characters, and the story really picks you up. \nA few hours of great fun.

The backgrounds clashed with the characters, the text windows were out of place and had no borders.\n\nIt seems like I'm missing a lot of the game, judging by the spoiler-filled community feed, but honestly I don't know if I care enough to go back and check it out.

Happy endings, escapism, and metric tons of sex. Before the next paragraph turns you off, I'd like to say, straight out, that this was a great game, and I'm glad I got it.\n\nFor this price, the game is worth trying out, at least. It's a bit rough around the edges; the UI is crude, there's no voice acting, and some of the H-scenes have no CG. The story straddles a border between heavy and light, and it's got a weird, outlandish feel.\n\nHowever, that's not a bad thing. If I had to describe this game using a cliche, I'd definitely call it a \"diamond-in-the-rough\". It's got all the qualities to be amazing (it even gives me Grisaia vibes, which I love) but everything just needs to be sanded more smoothly. Still, for this price, the game is definitely worth it. Despite all I said, the characters and story are memorable, and despite the awkward brevity with which they treat serious issues, there's still a sincere respect for it all that I can appreciate. There's enough reading, choices, and H-scenes that you don't feel cheated (again, for this great low price) and there's even a little animation at points for extra spice.\n\nThis was a great game. It may slip out of my memory soon enough, as I play enough VNs to kill a horse, but the ride was totally worth it. I definitely look forward to Dharker Studio's future works and may even check out their past works. The Western VN scene is small right now and I love that Dharker Studio is blazing their way into an unexplored wilderness, taking some notes from Japanese success but bringing their own unique flair to it, with a HUGE amount of endings and choices, unique subject matter catering to Western audiences, and a cool original art style.\n\nIf Dharker Studio is reading this, thanks, and keep up the great work!

The games story is about the main character \"Kyle\" going to a stupid program for delinquents because he was accused of setting fire to his school and something else i dont remeber right now...sorry. Anyway, you are being sent to this camp for other delinquents in the middle of nowhere, where there is 3 other girls who are in the same situation as you. To speed things up a bit, something happens that i wont spoil, that forces the 3 girls and you to find you're way back to civilization. The story isn't anything special, but it was certaintly enjoyable for me.\n\n2. If you like a visual novel with a lot of choices like me, then look no further. There is a Shit-ton of choices wich allows for a bunch of different endings, wich are all pretty different from each other.\n\n3. A important aspect of a visual novel is the grammer, sooooo does this game have good grammar?...Yes...well for the most part. There is a few typos here and there but nothing special if you dont pay attention you might even overlook them, that's how minor they are so don't worry about the grammar and writing they are both decent ;)\n\n4. There is bewbs and tits...nuff said ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n\n5. Visually the game looks okay. Its nothing amazing, but it's good. It's different from the other visual novels that i have played. And if you are wondering about the visuals...Just look at the screenshots.\n\nFinal Verdict: The Visual novel is solid in my opinion and is personally worth the 13 Euro's its asking for. And if you can get it on sale and you like visual novels, this should be a no-brainer ;)\n\nBTW: There is a 18+ patch that adds a few more \"Adult\" scenes to the whole thing and there's even an achivment for installing it...Yeah...GET IT!

I think. And spoilery.\nSo I found this scrolling through my queue and was going to look past it, thinking it another ecchi game that I'd regret wasting the money on. However, seeing all the positive reviews for it I decided to install it and give it a chance.\n\nNow granted, the ecchi stuff is still present (thanks mainly to the efforts of a certain blue-haired character), but it takes second stage to what is a truly interesting and at times harsh storyline. The amount of ways to affect how the story plays out are also good, meaning your choices do matter and decide which outcome you'll get. And trust me; you will find ones where you die. I've achieved a good chunk of the endings but it took me til my fourth playthrough to get what many would consider a good ending.\n\nThe characters are interesting. My one complaint is that I wish there could've been voice actors, even voice sound effects every now and then. That doesn't detract from the actual story though, and all three girls are well developed as people with layers of depth about them. The background art was fine, though on some it wasn't as good (like one of the instances you come across a cabin). The music was good, though I feel the tracks either weren't long enough or were used in scenes that might not match up, though that's my opinion and half the time I'm most likely wrong on audio stuff. As for the mechanics, it took me a while to find out how to bring up the menu mid-game, but otherwise it was fine. The fastforward button's a godsend when you're going completionist and don't want to wade through the same conversation a dozen times.\n\nOverall:\nThis game may appear as just another fanservice game, but beneath the skin there's quite a bit to like about this one. A good story with multiple avenues towards endings good and bad, meaning choices suddenly carry more weight, carry this game more than the girls assets. There are some areas for improvement but the majority of my complaints are nitpicks as I found myself enjoying it and driven to get all the endings.\n7.5/10\n\nTD;LR\nComes for the boobs, stay for the story.", "timestamp_created": 1501056893, "timestamp_updated": 1501057101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33659753": {"recommendationid": "33659753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314183747", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508122649}, "language": "english", "review": "Porn and death (with the uncensored add-on \ud83d\ude09).

The girls are very unique in appearance and personality, but they all clique together well at the same time. Even the side characters that aren't shown much are well designed. Every character you meet plays a critical role in the story. Despite being a VN, it also has a bit of choose your own adventure mixed in, which is great! Different directions you go within the forest can yield wildly different results, so try them all out. There are tons of endings, each girl has at least 3 (4 if you count harem ending) and there are endings for some side characters and 'short' endings. [spoiler] like getting mauled by a bear or \"eaten\" by a witch. [/spoiler]\n\nThe bad: Some of the text doesn't really match up with the scene at all, but that's pretty easy to look past. The routes can be overly complicated, some might think this is good, but I can't imagine most do.

I was expecting a quick casual anime-Visual Novel with a few 'Chievos in which the guy tries to romance every gal in the story and be done with it.  \n\nNot so fast there, Eider !  There is some meat on these VN bones ! \n\nAnd just to make it clear that this is not a \"compensated\" review, I paid $16.99 for it in April.  That is more than the current price in the Steam Store !  And I do not feel bad about that.  I got more than my money's worth of entertainment from ARMY GALS !!\n\nThis Visual Novel's story is worth your taking a look at it.  What I found in This ARMY GALS story is much more complex than the run-of-the-mill VN.  It has elements of  survival against the odds, a mad serial killer, tragedy, pathos, true love, murder {?} mystery, conspiracy plot, fantasy, and horror.  OK, it has its mandatory quota of sexual romps.  However, the overall story really is [u]compelling[/u].  \n\nARMY GALS has 21 game \u201cEndings\u201d which take a while to sort out.  Including these, there are 30 Steam Achievements to earn.  The Dev {Dharker Studios} has been responsive to gamer comments in the Forum.  One ending would not work in the initial release.  Dharker figured out what was wrong and promptly released a new version to fix it.  Dharker also has responded to Gamer questions and has given hints on how to reach endings.  \n\nSpeaking of the Dev, Dharker Studios has on easy-to-install online Restoration Patch that undoes the Steam censoring.  Dharker are pros at this and have done an excellent job of providing an 18++ rated VN. \n\n[u]The SETUP[/u]:\tYou become the Protagonist; Kyle, a male \"delinquent\" who was framed as being a Peeping Tom arsonist.  What a combination !!  You were sent here because they lacked proof of your \u201ccrimes\u201d.  What role will you play as this multi-ending tale evolves ? \n\nYou are met at a train station by the 2 Aggressive Rehabilitative Missionary Youth {A.R.M.Y.} Program counselors who will take you on a 2-day trip into the depths of a remote forest.   There you meet your fellow delinquents; 3 [u]Girls[/u], of course !  You all are to camp out here and commune with nature whilst the Counselors work their magic upon your collective psyches. \n\nThe next day, the head Counselor, of the famed {?} A.R.M.Y. Program, is found dead in a car wreck.  How did that happen ?  Was it an accident ?  Or was it murder ?  If murder, who \u201cdunnit\u201d ?  The only other Counselor left after a disagreement with that head Counselor, so she may never come back.  Nobody else knows where you are.  YOU don't know where you are. \n\nHow can this group of misguided and leaderless delinquents possibly get back to civilization from where you have been abandoned deep in a vast forest when you aren't sure of even the right direction to go ?  What deadly dangers lie in wait for you if you try; Bears, traps, ravines, mountains, serial killer, fantasy creatures ?  Or should you wait for rescue ?  How long will your food last. ?  Can you carry what you will need to make it out ? \n\nWell \u2026 Enough of this doom-and-gloom stuff.  Let's spend a day skinny dipping while we {try NOT to} think about it !  \n\nIf you work through this VN without a \u201cwalk-through\u201d to hold your hand, it should provide a challenge for several hours.  My Steam hours played is quite misleading.  You won't have to spend anywhere near that time to complete ARMY GALS.  I had the game up for days at a time while trying to put together a Guide, that now is available for your perusal.

This is now my favorite Dharker Studio's title:)\n\nU play as Kyle and get stranded in the woods with three beautiful ladies. U do meet two others also as u play the game. There are also references spinkled in the game I thought that was cool.\n\nI loved everything about Army Gals. The characters, story, art, bg, and music I loved all of them:)\n\nI didn't expect Army Gals to be a long game and I'm glad it was because I had a lot of fun getting all 30 endings.\n\nArmy Gals has lots of things that I didn't expect. Army Gals has comedy, romance, really hot scenes that some are animated;), creepy, and some horror elements. The creepy and horror elements were the two things I didn't expect which made Army Gals awesomer.\n\nOh boy some endings were really fucked up that that made u go oh with ur eyes turning wide. Some endings were sad and made me sad when I got the endings:( Endings that were happy made me happy:)\n\nMy favorite happy ending and character is Andrea. I just liked everything about her and I am glad I saved her happy ending for last:)\n\nI really wish somehow there was an ending with the fairy. The fairy part was my favorite part in the game. It made me laugh everytime I passed the fairy scene;)\n\nMake sure u get the adult patch because u will be missing out on a lot if u don't get the patch. The adult scenes were just great in my opinion.\n\nI highly recommend getting Army Gals as I had a lot of fun playing Army Gals;) :)", "timestamp_created": 1495491999, "timestamp_updated": 1495491999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31907539": {"recommendationid": "31907539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162703817", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495572544}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredibly dark.\n\nHands down, possibly the best work Dharker Studios has ever released, when it comes to story development. Although their writing usually consists of pairing the protagonist up with girls, and doing a bit of work to get towards 'certain' content, this goes well beyond that. At the beginning of the game, with Shelton's appearance, he infuriated me greatly.\n\nI figured his introduction would prove to make getting content difficult, because his attitude gave me that kind of impression. But after finding out what happens to him, then meeting Hannah, the game gets soo real. Raen is my all time favorite, with the chemistry the protag shows with Hannah being the only other relationship contesting that.\n\nFor her to be so serious after meeting Reed, was just way too fucked up. Son of a bitch got what he deserved. I was soo happy there was an ending where the girls all made it. This isn't an ordinary Dharker Studio game, as the content has pacing to it not normally found in others. Camping gone wrong though, is more fitting. \n\nVery replayable as far as I've seen, and I really can't emphasize how impressed I am how different the writing is in this one than others.\n\nIt's very well done, and deserves every purchase it gets.", "timestamp_created": 1495485483, "timestamp_updated": 1495494814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31834570": {"recommendationid": "31834570", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991964852", "num_games_owned": 506, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504283947}, "language": "english", "review": "Got eaten by a witch. 10/10 would get lost in woods again", "timestamp_created": 1495170795, "timestamp_updated": 1495170795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582014", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31763904": {"recommendationid": "31763904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068680779", "num_games_owned": 333, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504678299}, "language": "english", "review": "[b] Disclaimer - I bought the Deluxe Edition of this game full price, and got 100% Steam Achievements and played with the Adult Patch [/b]\n\n\n[b] Army Gals Review [/b] \nArmy Gals is a Multiple choice several route Visual Noval with an Adult patch, Developed by Dharker Studio and Brightly Studios, Published by Dharker Studio and released April 17, 2017 with a confirmed soon to be released DLC\n\n[b] Art/Music [/b]\nI want to say I 100% loved every bit of Art in this game with only a single complaint - there was not enough of it!!\nEspecially the Adult Art I felt there was so many situations in which instead of using the same Art they should have made  more of the beautiful Art I was so fond of. The music was nice, I found it set the mood perfectly throughout the game.\n\n[b] Story and Characters [/b]\nI found writing and story quite enjoyable, I laughed felt anger and was on the edge of my seat the entire time! I enjoyed getting every end without fail. Far as Edda Andrea, Raen and Kyle, I felt Kyle was pretty much an average Visual Noval main protagonist. I enjoyed Edda as being a strong confident Female character, with a interesting background (avoiding spoilers) Raen the typical Lovey Female as portrayed in most Visual Novals with quite the twist! And last but not least, Andrea now I enjoyed her as a character as much as the rest, but I felt that the personality they aimed for her kept getting lost, with her going from one way to the next, now that's not a complaint, I enjoy more diverse character's.\n\n[b] Pros and Cons [/b]\nPros:\nGood story\nFantastic art\nGood patch\nGood music\nDecent side character's\n\nCons:\nNot enough art\nSaves are kinda confusing\n\nA very enjoyable Visual Noval which I am EXCITED for more Art like this from Dharker Studios and the future (I hope) DLC(s) for this game! Overall I give it a 9/10 due to lack of art and pricing.\n\n[i] If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [/i]  [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/GameRelatedUniverse] The Group [/url]", "timestamp_created": 1494832658, "timestamp_updated": 1494832751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618079", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31719679": {"recommendationid": "31719679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295899501", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494667589}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5565\u90fd\u522b\u8bf4\u4e86\uff0c\u5750\u7b49\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u53ea\u6c42\u4e2d\u6587", "timestamp_created": 1494667637, "timestamp_updated": 1494667637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614343", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31597370": {"recommendationid": "31597370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354159779", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 549, "last_played": 1515957158}, "language": "english", "review": "not gonna lie: i was bullied into buying this.\n\n       @Blue im lookin at u\n\nupdate: finished the game and got Cheryl ending... once again not gonna lie: went from 0 to 100 in the deppresion factor real quick.\nHonestly kinda wanna play through again", "timestamp_created": 1494138668, "timestamp_updated": 1494142235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531673", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31592359": {"recommendationid": "31592359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130727834", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494113174}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow - 21 endings to track down, motion animation (w/patch), a variety of characters, and some true evil to vanquish...

I honestly enjoyed more than I expected, and it was quite satisfying to get all the achievements. The three main girls are the highlight together with the diverse choices that can lead to lots of possibilities. \n\nThe story seems simple at first, but there are so many possibilities here that it\u2019s insane. [spoiler]You can literally have an orgy because of a magical fairy\u2019s power and there\u2019s also a f*cking psycho wanting to kill you. NOW THAT\u2019S DIVERSITY.[/spoiler]\nThe girls are great too, even if the MC is somewhat blah with little personality. They definitely make that up with the narration and dialogues, and I found myself caring about the characters. It\u2019s not a masterpiece, but definitely a good experience if you want fan service and lots of interaction. \n\n7/10. I wish that the MC was more developed (and had a face lol) to be honest. BGM can get repetitive after a while, and the art style is okay (it could\u2019ve been better to be honest, but at the same time it kinda gave the game a certain charm. It\u2019s like, that\u2019s the \u201cArmy Gals style\u201d. I don\u2019t know how to explain). I recommend this title if you\u2019re not only after beewbs since there\u2019s lots of choices and dialogues. Also, the R18 scenes are animated.", "timestamp_created": 1492823774, "timestamp_updated": 1492823774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.790770", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31286163": {"recommendationid": "31286163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145491881", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 791, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504501448}, "language": "english", "review": "( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) expand dongus ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)", "timestamp_created": 1492821885, "timestamp_updated": 1492821885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.288783", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31282888": {"recommendationid": "31282888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021793898", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505256810}, "language": "english", "review": "Army Gals is a story about a high school student Named kyle who due to unlucky circumstances, ends up attending a \"Delinquent\" rehabilitation camp. Set in the woods, kyle meets a variety of characters, the main three being edda, raen, and andrea along with several minor characters. The story progresses as the characters interact, face perhaps deadly challenges, and have a little fun.\n\nArt 8/10 - The art resembled Japanese animation typical of a visual novel, but it felt more american. This does not take away from the good artwork of the characters, or the backgrounds of the game. This game does contain nudity, so please be advised.\n\nGameplay 10/10 - The gameplay is very limited because it is a visual novel, but thats exactly what you would expect from a visual novel. It did it's job in telling the story, and it seems to have many routes to take which offered a wide variety of outcomes, and a good enough compliment of possible choices. \n\nStory 8/10 - The story was quite interesting and actually had me guessing and wanting to know what was going to come next. Some scenes were well put together with a nice compliment of erotic, emotional, horror, and thrilling scenes. The game also provides multiple endings to suite the tastes of the player.\n\nMusic/Sound 6/10 - The Music for this game i found was nice, but also bland. While enjoying the game, i would actually sometimes forget that music did accompany the game.\n\nOverall 9/10 - Overall i really enjoyed the game, clocking in 12 hours of gameplay with all achievements completed. The amount of possible routes in the game made it fun and never boring, and well worth the 13.99$. \n\nA few last minute comments\n\nthe owners of the game have put out an uncensored patch for the game containing adult video scenes, adult illustrations, \nAdult Scenes, Character Sprites, Animated scenes, Extra adult section in the gallery, extra animation section, and you get to unlock the steam achievment \"patched at start\" \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/420980/discussions/0/135514231765617537/ <== uncensored path information\n\nAlso the developers of the game will also be releasing a new dlc scene with the deluxe editon some time this year.\n\nI highly recommend this game for any visual novel lover.", "timestamp_created": 1492806933, "timestamp_updated": 1512002895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517120", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31247071": {"recommendationid": "31247071", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986919262", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504313242}, "language": "english", "review": "This latest offering from Dharker Studios is perhaps their best yet.\n\nWith some truly complex conversation paths, and many interlocking pieces, there's at least a good 5 hours of play available, possibly even more if you don't make constant use of the skip button. I actually found myself re-reading the dialog many times over as I went through each of the 20 possible endings.\n\nThe artwork, while being standard Dharker fare for the most part, is at the higher end of their particular spectrum. If you use the uncensored patch, this game includes some pretty decent animated movie bits, and the H content is quite delightfully explicit, yet not over the top.\n\nThe characters are definitely some of my favourites (Andrea is now my top waifu), and the dialog flows well through most of the game. There's a few rough patches in less-traveled branches of the story, but the rest is some good reading.\n\nAll in all, if you like visual novels with sexual innuendo (and content!), this is a game for you.

Please don't take this too harshly as I really never play erotic novel games. Skip to bottom for tl/dr / conclusion.\n\nPROS:\n\n1. Let's start off possitive, this game brings a very decent variaty of possible endings. Some of them more interesting than the other but it feels like there is a lot variety which is good. Some storylines countain new characters that give an extra dimension to the story and feel a bit refreshing. I applaud the creators for putting effort into making 25+ storylines.\n\n2. The characters are clich\u00e9 but interesting enough to keep the story going.\n\n3. Original artwork! \n\n4. The sexual encounters you do find are pretty entertaining although sometimes a bit too much.\n\nCONS:\n\n1. This is a big one in my opinion. Despite bringing original art work into a game which I truly respect, and find refreshing, the drawings were lackluster. \nThere weren't nearly enough drawing of all the different settings (which were plentiful!) to support all the stories. I found a lot of drawing reused or simply mirrored for completely different settings. This was a big disappointment. Besides that the quality of the drawing left a lot to wish for. Weirdly shaped bodyparts, weird angles and sometimes facial expressions.\n\n2. Conversations were extremely long (actually some taking over 20 minutes to get through) and not interesting enough for me to actually read. Shame. There also aren't many options for you to interact with the story which made it even more of a stretch. Also I've encountered where the options you DID have lead to the same scenes over and over (sometimes even on different times in the story and in repetition!). Definitely could have used some more effort.\n\n3. There is no real way to go after any given girl. You just wound up in random situations with a random girl which can lead to some anoyance. Sometimes you spend hours trying to get to the specifics and end up nowhere which kinda defeats the purpose.\n\n4. A lack of sexual nudity if that is what you're looking for.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION/ TL:DR:\n\nAlthough this game brings some original artwork and a big variety of different endings, the subpar/mediocre artwork, stretched conversations and mostly the lack of interaction in those, combined with the lack of nudity/sexual content makes it impossible for me to recommend this game. It has good moments and features but it simply isnt enough to overlook the obvious flaws.

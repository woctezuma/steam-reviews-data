I recently picked it up again but sadly the recent patches/introduction of the deluxe version seems to have made it extremely unstable: It's been practically impossible to play this game without getting a hard crash at least every hour. In the last hour it even crashed 5 times. \nThe game itself is really fun, probably one of my favorite TD games, the story is actually quite intriguing which is unusual for a game of this type, plus it has a lot of wacky humour. The gameplay is what you would expect from a TD game, with some twist but most importantly some of the best QoL features I've seen in any TD game. \nHowever 5 crashes in a single hour? That's definitely a dealbreaker which is such a shame considering how good the game itself is. I might even try to go back to the old nondeluxe version to see if its actually more stable than the deluxe version", "timestamp_created": 1516121446, "timestamp_updated": 1516121628, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39381675": {"recommendationid": "39381675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005532802", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472798689}, "language": "english", "review": "Good almost great tower defense game.

I was expecting a fairly basic Kongregate-y tower defense game that I could run through once and get bored.\n\n78 hours of play in (in under a week), I still have a bunch more achievements left to get and I'm still having fun.\n\nNew Game+ I was expecting to be the base game over again but harder and with better stuff - nope, there's a huge extra plot reveal and new sidequests. And your equipment upgrades and leveling up transfer between regular and NG+ play! It's so well integrated.\n\nThere's also the Hero Mode achievements, which are what I'm working on now. I kind of expected to be bored playing through again to get them, but you have to completely revamp your strategy when you don't have generic heroes, and it's way more engaging than I expected.\n\nI also really, really appreciate the accessibility options for extra XP and treasure. They allow me to get through the hero mode game without having to do a bunch of boring grinding to get my level up high enough to be successful, which makes it way easier to stay engaged with the game instead of getting bored and wandering off because I'm sick of replaying the same fight. And I was stunned and delighted to find that the achievements don't punish me for using the acessibility scrap/xp boosts. Bravo, devs, I appreciate that so much.\n\nOh, and it actually has an interesting plot, which is the last thing I expected from a tower defense game!\n\nThis was absolutely worth what I paid for it on sale, and I would happily pay full price for it knowing what I do now. My only disappointment is that there aren't any other games by the dev for me to buy :)", "timestamp_created": 1515780406, "timestamp_updated": 1515780529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39242349": {"recommendationid": "39242349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018108667", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1384639769}, "language": "german", "review": "Sehr gutes kleines Tower Defense Spiel.

I'm very glad I did. The quality and hilarity of the writing does indeed extend to the game itself, and so much more really. This is easily the best story I've ever seen in a tower defense game, and indeed it ranks among the best stories I've read in a game period. The journal adds a ton of depth to the characters, and the game has made me gasp, worry about the characters, and at one point at least openly weep. The writing is AMAZING. I cannot hammer this home enough. \n\n\"But I don't care about all that namby pamby story and characters and emotion and stuff, how's the GAME play!?\" I hear you say, as I slowly reach for the lever on the makeshift guillotine poised precariously over your head. Fine. You want to know about the gameplay? I'll tell you about the gameplay. It's excellent. Tower/Hero defense games will never be earth shattering when it comes to innovating mechanics, but this is a very solid, tightly balanced tower defense game, and the most fun one I think I've ever played. Placement and tactics can make all the difference, but in true RPG fashion, you can always go level up and unlock some new skills or upgrade your equipment if your strategy of choice isn't -quiiiiitttee- cutting it. \n(A word about difficulty: if you play the game on normal, it's pretty easy, possibly distressingly so if you want a challenge. Play on advanced if you want the challenge, though you may want to come back later with new classes for certain enemies.)\n\nIt's the RPG side of the gameplay that really has me hooked, trying to move the story forward to unlock new shops for better gear and then using that gear to go back and try the expert level which lets me get some extra scrap for new gear or even better unlock a new UNIQUE ITEM (oooh, aaahhh) which, in new game + can be upgraded with delicious magic skulls for extremely epic unique items that have unique abilities as well. The gameplay loop is so engaging I have more than once looked up and noticed that 6 hours have gone by without me realizing.\n\nTL;DR: It's great. buy it. If you want to wait for a sale go for it, but seriously, buy it. amazing writing, excellent tower defense gameplay, and excellent RPG gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1514455299, "timestamp_updated": 1514455299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.570201", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38746393": {"recommendationid": "38746393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038832094", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 116, "last_played": 1516291510}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u505a\u5f97\u4e0d\u932f\u7684\u5854\u9632\u904a\u6232\uff0c\u4ee5\u6027\u50f9\u6bd4\u4f86\u8aaa\u4e5f\u6c92\u6709\u751a\u9ebc\u597d\u6311\u5254\u7684\u3002\u7e41\u4e2d\u6f22\u5316\u4ecd\u6709\u4e00\u9ede\u5c0f\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u7919\u904a\u73a9\u3002\u559c\u6b61\u73a9\u5854\u9632\u904a\u6232\u5c31\u8d81\u7279\u50f9\u6642\u8cb7\u4e0b\u5427\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1514395864, "timestamp_updated": 1514396048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38735069": {"recommendationid": "38735069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262615008", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514504593}, "language": "english", "review": "i love  this game.

Now they're a dime a dozen on Steam. The real question is \"which ones are worth a damn?\" and in my opinion, Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is one such worthwhile TD. Why? Well, let's see...\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nIt has a cartoon-like look to it, and has a smooth design, in my opinion. It's nothing visually jaw-dropping, but it gets the job done, and I feel like the characters' facial expressions and body language did an excellent job emoting and making me like the characters more. I won't say more on that until the story section, though.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nI really liked the music in this game. I wouldn't compare it to memorable tracks from a Final Fantasy game or a SuperGiant game (Bastion, etc.), but it's still good stuff that fits in well and was enjoyable while it played.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nYour protagonist summons different combat characters into a maze-like pre-established battle map, and as per the typical TD, you can place the characters where you want. The protagonist is locked down in a pre-set starting position and is the \"core\" or \"lives\" you're trying to guard. Each of the characters you summon can be \"boosted\" (i.e. leveled up per battle) up to five times, unlocking new abilities for use in the fight which will help out.\n\nI played this game twice: once something several years ago...a little while after it first came out and got a discount, and again just last night and tonight. The first time, I hired recruits, and the extra unnamed characters deteriorated my interest in the game and I stopped playing for a couple of years because I didn't like the recruits. This time, however, I was compelled to complete the game, as a \"hero mode\" setting (new, I think) was available where you only use story characters in battles, meaning a maximum of six combatants plus your spell-slinging protagonist.\n\nEach level has different rewards and star ratings with various difficulties to play them at. You can get unique gear that can't be bought in the game's various shops that is often better than what's offered in shops lby doing the tougher difficulties on maps. When you complete the game, new game + is unlocked. You can either go back to your first playthrough and try to get more stars/items unlocked, or you can start over in new game + with your gear and XP, and try to take the game on again. That said, I got my butt handed to me badly on new game + so I went back to the first playthrough. Unfortunately, despite my best efforts and doing a respec on my protagonist, I was not good enough to get the higher-star scenarios done in the latter part of a cave system onward. I could have tried the second hardest difficulty, but I didn't really want to bother with that.\n\n[h1]Storyline...Wait, Storyline in a Tower Defense Game???[/h1]\nI know I'm being redundant here, but this is a tower defense game...with a [i]storyline[/i] that's not awful. In fact, the good ending (there are two endings!) was rather satisfying and felt like a better conclusion than I've seen to a lot of movies, and certainly better than I've seen in most games. The dev kept the number of characters small enough to be fairly memorable and give different characters screen time, and the aforementioned facial expressions and the characters' dialog are bursting with charm. He enjoys being silly, and I found myself smiling many times throughout the game's storyline, thanks to the more entertaining characters' lines. \n\nI even really liked the lead protagonist. Leaders of groups are often very uninteresting, portrayed as perfectly balanced and level-headed, not doing anything exciting or interesting, and lacking fun dialog. With Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten, this was handled well in my opinion.\n\nAzra, the lead character in Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten, is fairly straight-laced externally, but does have some playful dialog with different characters, and you can read her journal which has tons of updates, both lore-filled and incredibly silly. It makes her a far better character than most group leaders I've seen in entertainment, and I cared about her and the other team members.\n\nNOTE TO DEV: In the \"bad\" ending, I can't recall it perfectly, but a word was missing in the text across the screen when it's dark. They're talking about a length of time that passed, and a word is missing on the screen. It may have been \"to\" or \"for\" or something like that. It was a brief word that was missing.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nDefender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is graphically simple, yet attractive in a nicely-drawn cartoon fashion, with enjoyable tower defense gameplay, and perhaps the deepest storyline I've seen in a tower defense game, at least from a character depth and lore depth perspective. This game obviously comes from a developer who was very into what he was making. Many people can be developers these days, put out a garbage game, and put no effort into it. Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten couldn't be further from that. It is one of the TDs I have enjoyed the most. I came for the gameplay, but I stayed for the storyline/characters. It's bizarre, but I'm okay with this. :D", "timestamp_created": 1507612066, "timestamp_updated": 1511464323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597140",

I like leveling up my charachters and equipping them and then putting my Tower Defense skills to the test. A great balance of difficulty and a proper difficulty curve. \n\nCons: The game sometimes freezes. I don't know why. And I will admit I have not tried to seek out the forum yet for possibly fixes. I use Windows 10. I 7700K, GTX 1070.  The longer a level lasts the more likely it's going to freeze. Some levels are like 30+ minutes when your trying to slowly burn down a boss. Meaning it can be annoying. However this is only a minor problem overall as I have not encountered this issue on more then 2-3 levels really. Some other crashes as well but it's fairly rare. Solution: If I know I beat a level 100% and it only froze because it was like 30+ minutes in and a boss was down to like 20% HP and it freezes.

I still found myself loving it, especially with the better art and looks at lore in the improved NG+ mode. The only thing that holds me back from really enjoying the game to its fullest is the fact that the gold/unobtanium? skull shop never opens for me even when I put the codes in. I know that there's a fix to this if you're on windows by exporting your save, opening the file, and editing it yourself. However, that's not really an option for me since I play on Mac and have no idea on how to fix such things.\n\n\nStill, I digress. Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten (DX Edition) is a continuously fun game to play for those who love the Tower Defense/RPG genre. Each of the characters shown have decently constructed personalities that are expanded upon through the MC's journal/diary. While the game itself can be cleared with relative ease, players should quickly find themselves attempting to clear \"extreme\" runs in order to give themselves a challenge and in order to get unique items. I look forward to the next game, whenever that may come. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1501011218, "timestamp_updated": 1501011218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33773991": {"recommendationid": "33773991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405504570", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500251231}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u597d\u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1500930840, "timestamp_updated": 1500930840, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.418848", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33744404": {"recommendationid": "33744404", "author": {"steamid": "76561198401201990", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501287605}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u592a\u597d\u73a9\u4e86\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u6211\u559c\u6b22TOWER DEFENDER\u7c7b\u578b\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u662f\u50cf\u7d20\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u8d76\u7d27\u5165\u624b\u5427\n\u8bbe\u7f6e\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u653b\u51fb\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5347\u7ea7\u4e70\u88c5\u5907\uff0c\u771f\u7684\u6709\u610f\u601d", "timestamp_created": 1500817430, "timestamp_updated": 1500817430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33729058": {"recommendationid": "33729058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058623259", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467506278}, "language": "english", "review": "I repurchased this after my original copy had stopped working due to flash/OS compatibility problems.

[/h1]\n\nI played through the normal game mode in around 13 hours, completeing the highest difficulty on about half of the levels.\nDefender's Quest plays in a rather novel way, where the 'towers' placed to defeat the incoming waves of enemies are actually characters with health, items, levels and individual abilites. Some of these characters take part in the story, which is surprisingly not as awful as in most other Tower Defense games. \n\nLeveling up, getting new items and some hilariously written dialogue lines make for a very addicting start of the game. \nHowever, about half-way through the repetitiveness of the gameplay really shines through.\nMoving down hordes of enemies is highly satisfying and thankfully levels can be sped up and slowed down any time, significantly lowering the time where you wait for your next action.\n\nI enjoyed my time with this game a lot. The 13 hours I put into the game over the course of a few days. It sets itself apart from the vast majority of Tower Defense games by giving the towers some actual life.\nUltimately I did stop after one playthrough, forgoing the New Game+ mode, as I have become tired of the repetitiveness.\nBut I rarely ever go for a NG+ mode in any game, so you might actually revel in grinding through some more of the levels.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1499771772, "timestamp_updated": 1499771772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33452165": {"recommendationid": "33452165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025628376", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498690048}, "language": "english", "review": "Addictive tower defense game with a twist: the turrets are characters who can be equipped, trained and taught new skills/attacks.

And woah, what a surprise it was!\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n [*] The gameplay for tower defense is extremely hooking! I suffered from \"just one more stage\" syndrome. I thorougly enjoyed it!\n [*] Game experience is customizable - you can adjust how much experience and gold you earn from battles - whether it's 100%, something less, or something more, up to 300%. I personally recommend something close to 200-300. With 100 the game feels very grindy and you have to repeat older stages over and over and over to get some exp. I think higher exp set up eases the grind while not making the challenge itself much easier. There is also decent option of changing speed of battles which lets you fluently change the speed, from 1/4x to 16x of normal one.\n [*] Game has some rpg elements - you can choose skill trees for your main units and it tries to have a decent story.\n [*] For an indie game music is quite decent. Nothing extremely memoriable, but it's fine and doing it's job well.\n [*] With skipping grind by boosting received exp, the length feels about right - about 20-25 hours to 100% I imagine. Very good value for current discounted price (~5 euro as of time of the review)\n [*] The game feels like labour of love from developers and not just a venue for making money. From what I see, it received free HD \"deluxe\" update in the past, and there was an update less than 2 weeks ago adding new languages support! Doesn't happen very often for over 4 years old game. I'm impressed by developers' care of it.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n [*] This is one of the worst presentation-wise game I've played in a very long time. While tower defense gameplay itself is a cool pixel-art, dialogues presenting story are very bad - just a still arts with static comic bubble speeches. It feels very lackluster and uniteresting. I'm also not a fan of the art - some characters, like an archer heroine just does not look good. It made story hard to follow for me, and ultimately I couldn't engage seriously into adventure of the main group and what was going on in the plot. I really wish there was anything to make presentation more lively. Some animations during dialogues akin to Neptunia? Some noises other than music during dialogue? Simply text appearing in a pace mimicking speech? Different fonts or effects to express emotions such as shaking of dialogue box to express fear? I'm not sure. Quite a decent writing was sunken by this in my opinion.\n [*] RPG trees are a facade for most of the characters - for example it's quickly quite obvious that any defensive option is a bad choice, since characters are more than enough durable. I don't think there is any meaningful choice or trade-off in build creation.\n [*] \"Experience as intended\" (aka 100% of exp/gold) is extremely grindy and I don't recommend it. It requires heading back to previously completed stages to grind them over and over to get more experience for the characters. It also leads to sudden difficulty spikes where you find out your characters are not good enough and need to grind again. Thankfully, developers added option to customize experience gain up to 300%, so it's not a major con.\n[/list]\n\nIf I had to give number score to the game, it would be [b]9/10[/b]. This game to me is a proof that gameplay is the most important component of the game. Sure, the presentation is abysmal, one of the worst I've ever seen. But it doesn't change the fact, that it was extremely engaging and hooking indie game to me. It's very well done tower defense with decent and funny at times story, albeit terribly presented.

The game consists mostly of mowing down a conga line of various enemies that constantly move towards your main character as an end goal. Place your Knights, Berserkers, Druids and Ice Mages like buildings beside the highway and enjoy the fireworks, swords and arrows flowing. Recruit more units and upgrade them while spending experience points or buy them better equipment.\n\nWhile looking at the bare game, RPG and Tower Defense mechanics aren't that much complicated. There aren't that many character classes, statistics and different weapon types like in a classic RPG game and Tower Defense parts aren't that much complex either. It's quite a simple game in reality, but this doesn't deter me from stating the fact that the game can be very enjoyable when you get the right flow for it, which is quite important and enforced by one of the weirdest difficulty curves I have ever seen in gaming period.\n\nWhile attending the battle, you have a choice between several difficulty levels. You level up and get cash after the fight, but even playing on Normal, you will find yourself struggling with keeping up with the enemies. Eventually you will hit that unmovable roadblock which might be very frustrating if you don't know what to do. [i]And what you should do? [/i]  Every time you hit that unreachable challenge, go back to the previous missions and play them on higher difficulties. You will find your team extremely overpowered while gaining wind in the sails back again. At this point the game starts becoming a task of choosing the right battles, backtracking and creative grind, while still getting meaningful progress with it by obtaining unique equipment, experience and skill points. You will be constantly switching back and forth between story progress and grinding to stack up. Your team will meander between being very powerful and unable to advance in this endless circle until the end credits, and truth be told, this somehow ends up as a satisfying experience. Because of those constantly shifting roadblocks, you will often times witness your party taking on previously unimaginable tasks and it is very cathartic to experience those situations. Mowing down tons and tons of zombies that previously were relentlessly biting your back? Those moments drive straight home.\n\nWhile this system creates a game where experience grinding is fun, it isn\u2019t without its flaws. This whole circle of  progress, backtracking and shifting difficulties is quite hard to notice and tune in to, making beginner\u2019s experience quite frustrating. People are conditioned to stick to one difficulty for a singular playthrough of a game. Break from that habit may come only after a few \u201cquits\u201d that I personally experienced. It takes some time to get the right clue and to find the flow. There is also that problem of New Game+ which basically extends the whole cycle for \u201canother round\u201d. Unfortunately, staying ahead of the difficulty curve becomes a real challenge, resulting in more roadblocks than I would wish for, putting progress to a crawl. This can be mitigated a little bit by using the punishment-free experience gain modifiers in options menu, but it kinda feels like cheating to me.\n\nLiking everything so far? That\u2019s very good, because the presentation sure wouldn\u2019t win you over. Even after the Deluxe update, sprites don\u2019t really look that good and story parts remind me of Newgrounds with its below-mediocre art and music. This is a big shame because the story itself isn\u2019t half-bad and also fits the gameplay in the sense that it also likes to flip-flop between several states: the [i]Deepest Lore[/i] mode with the serious, classic fantasy shtick and [i]Absolutely Don\u2019t Give a Damn About Convention[/i] mode where interactions between characters are so hilarious that you can be sure that writers had some real fun writing those. In both modes the quality stays on a decently high level, so I cannot really complain on that department. Those humorous moments can feel a little out of place, but most jokes hit that sweet mark leaving a positive impression.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m recommending Defender\u2019s Quest. If you like building your little snowballs of death, constantly tripping out while climbing the mountain and getting even bigger snowball in the process, then I invite you to put some dosh to dev\u2019s pocket. It is a curious little title which doesn\u2019t like to be put in a single niche and those looking for something different yet familiar to their tastes will definitely appreciate that.", "timestamp_created": 1498085154, "timestamp_updated": 1498086365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.860510", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32623790": {"recommendationid": "32623790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021604789", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6739, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498158361}, "language": "english", "review": "One (if not the) best Tower Defense Game i played (i tried them all...)\n\nThe gameplay is awesome - the content amounts allot (Replay Game+ with new quests and fights and rewards)\nThe story and quest texts are the funiest i ever read in a game!!!\n\nVery well done!

And Yes, I've actually played it for hundreds of hours. There was a time when every day while I was winding down I'd put youtube videos on and just play this game, for hours. It's hard to pinpoint what exactly about it is such a draw to me. I think that the gameplay is super satisfying, the story is well-written and actually interesting, and the progression of equipment and levels feels fair and gives you a lot of choices.\n\nBeating the game is really only the beginning and throughout your entire first playthrough the game won't be too challenging, your main strategy choice is where to put your archers, which are easily the best class early on. In New Game +, the enemies have various strengths that go beyond just \"more health and damage\" which is nice. Stuff like 50% ranged damage resistance to make you switch up tactics, fading in and out of targetability to make it harder to clump units into a death zone, etc.\n\nYou also get a new type of reward: in the first playthrough, you accumulate legendary weapons and armor by completing the levels on harder difficulties, which is great but has two issues. They don't feel very unique since it's just high stats, and eventually the stuff you can buy becomes better than the legendary stuff so they're useless. NG+ gives Skulls as a reward for beating higher difficulties that you trade in to upgrade the legendary items, and the upgrades fix both issues. The upgraded legendary items are better stats-wise than the stuff you buy, and they get unique abilities like extra bleed chance, higher crit damage, etc.\n\nAnother cool thing in NG+ is the addition of several levels where you can only use certain classes, so you might have a level with only berserkers and healers. These levels also introduce a new character who is cool. \n\nBasically if you like tower defense games this game is perfect for you, or if you just want a game to relax and wind down with it's been prefect for that for me.", "timestamp_created": 1494021361, "timestamp_updated": 1494021361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621444", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31516570": {"recommendationid": "31516570", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970914785", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493872947}, "language": "english", "review": "One of, if not the best tower defense game ever made.

It follows a typical X unit is good against X enemy type formula, and for the most part this works well.\n\n+ The story in this game is much better than you'd ever expect from a game of this type. You can more-or-less ignore it if you don't care, but if you take the time to read the journal entries, you'll find that the world and characters are very fleshed out. A lot of the characters and situations are very tongue-in-cheek, which relieves some of the tension a game like this can inspire. :)\n\n+ Level design constantly pushes  you out of your comfort zone. You often find that you can't quite use units in the way that you'd want to because of the limitations on the terrain. Things don't get as monotonous as a result of this.\n\n+ For a tower defense game, it's pretty long. If you're a veteran of the genre and can breeze through tough fights with effortless tactical accumen, you'll find that getting maximum stars on each level takes about 10-15+ hours.\n\n+ New Game Plus (NG+) adds sidequests that aren't available in the normal game, which includes new story and cutscenes. The behind-the-scenes journal entries are also really interesting.\n\n+ Hero Mode makes for an even more challenging game (you can only use the 6 story characters).\n\n+ Lots of customization for loadouts, units, etc. Branching skill trees make the customization feel a little more fleshed out, although some options are clearly better than others.\n\n+ The DX version of the game vastly improves the graphics. The biggest mark against the original game was that it was in SD and the art looked very amateur. With this update, the game supports HD/Widescreen resolutions, and all sprites/cutscenes look 1000% better.\n\n+ You have the option of increasing the amount of XP and Scrap (money) you get after each battle by up to 300%. Scrap isn't all that useful, but XP is mana from heaven. This is great, because if you left it at 100%, it'd take a metric fuckton of grinding to get to the end of the game. See cons for reasons why even this feature doesn't save NG+ from grindiness, unfortunately.\n\n- In the normal game, Rangers are by far the best unit. You can win almost every fight by just using them, even on Expert. It seems that the developers were very aware of this, which is why --\n\n- In NG+, the Ranger (the only [i]real[/i] ranged unit in the game) is the subject of immense nerfs. Many enemies that appear in large numbers and have high speed either have 50% resistance to ranged damage, or 60-70% ranged [b]evasion[/b]. These are the kinds of enemies you'd want an archer for because they can slip past your melee, but your archers can't hit them. This really hurts the unit's viability in a lot of fights. I feel like the challenge could have been increased without this frustrating change. There are some enemies that the Ranger is still really good at dealing with, but mostly you'll be relying on melee in Expert modes.\n\n- Most of the added difficulty in NG+ is artificial. Inflated HP and stats, enemies that phase out so that you can't target them, etc. You're often forced to spam global spells to deal with certain situations because your units simply can't no matter how you have them set up. This mode just isn't very well done in my opinion. It's frustrating and tedious, not fun.\n\n- The super sheep levels are tedious and not fun at all. You kill a slow moving sheep (that you can slow even more) that has about a bazillion HP and takes optimal tactics and resource management to kill before it reaches the end of the level. It is a very boring, very long fight even with the game sped up to 16x speed, and you have to do it TWICE in order to get all the achievements. If you're a completionist, you'll be subjected to several grindy annoyances, which brings me to the final gripe:\n\n- If you complete the game in Hero Mode (can't recruit units), once you've finished those achievements (after finishing NG+), you'll want to recruit units because there are some levels that are impossible to get 3 gold stars on with only the main 6 heroes. Unfortunately, the recruited units at that point will be so low level that even setting the XP to 300% is an unbearable grind to get them to 60. Battles take a long time to fight, and the XP from a battle -might- give your units half a level. You can imagine how long this would take. This was originally a community challenge that the developers put into the game later (along with associated achievements), but they didn't really balance the post-achievement gameplay for it. I actually gave up with only a few achievements left to get. Not worth it.\n\nOverall, if you're interested in a tower defense game that's challenging and satisfying in the base game, and aren't too concerned with unlocking every last achievement, then this game is for you.

The short of it is that if you like tower defense this is a good addition to your collection.  Even without a sale the price is worth it, though this game could have been more appropriate for a tablet I didn\u2019t feel cheated and was left satisfied overall.\n\nGraphics and Audio:  The art is basic, no way around that, but it gives a certain charm with that understanding.  Unlike many games this one understands that the core is gameplay not graphics and audio.  Instead of doing a poor job I feel that the developers made the most of they could without cutting quality or requiring a tripple A budget., can\u2019t really complain and the second game looks like they are bringing it to the next level without cutting that charm.\n\nTower Defense:  The game is simple enough, you \u2018build\u2019 towers by summoning characters and level them during the match which dramatically increases their power and unlocks a new attack (assuming they know the skill).  The combination of skills needed (like piercing armor or slowing) along with the unique pathing of each unit type gives a lot of strategy.\n\nRPG:  The leveling system is decent but a bit shallow; this really isn\u2019t an issue as the game\u2019s leveling mechanics do exactly what is intended.  Along with some gear (weapons, armor and books) and a small bit of color customization for your characters it certainly could be better but I left the game content.  This small addition gives you something to work towards, a reason to 'grind' levels over and a method to make levels harder wtihout require silly levels of micro or creating a game that simply overrun with templates and walkthroughs that anyone can copy.\n\nStory:  The narrative is good, the background and story told is very interesting in the premise although it could use a bit of work in the telling.  The mix of silly humor and playful tones keeps the game light without undermining the games overall serious story (looking at you Slak!), no, you aren\u2019t getting BioWare story telling, but you aren\u2019t getting generic forgettable story arc A either.  I\u2019d definitely read a novel based around this fiction.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure what else to say, it is a solid game, especially for the price.  Even more so if you are looking to scratch that tower defense itch that seems to be dried up for now.

If you're looking for the best-in-class tower defense game, this is not it.\n\n[b]details[/b]\nThe game has us accompany Azra, the royal librarian of a fantasy land, through her journey across the land where she must overcome various evils. You wouldn't play this game for its story per se but the dialogs and well crafted scenery and overworld make for a compelling reason to keep playing. Via overlay tutorials the player is introduced gently into the actual gameplay of placing and managing your figthers. While the start is great you soon realize that there isn't a lot of depth to the gameplay. I've played Warcraft 3 custom maps that had more mechanical variety in their tower defense than this game.\n\nThe mechanics merit a closer look because they are the Achilles' heel of this game really. There just isn't a lot to do other than the basics : placing your figthers (towers) and upgrading them, using your global hero powers now an dthen. There's no option to call a wave early for extra cash, no towers that teleport mobs to the beginning of the maze, no flying units that ignore the ground paths altogether, no possiblity to send your own troops against the enemy, etc., etc.\nMostly you'll be fighting against zombie like creatures which is justified by the story but it gets stale fast. There's a missed opportunity here for including a much more diverse set of enemies that challenge the player to adjust their strategy and tactics.\n\nOutside of combat you'll have the opportunity to manage your party by purchasing equipment, acquiring new fighters up your fighters by assigning points in a talent tree. The game limits itself to 6 classes of figthers (towers) all of which are nicely integrated into and justified by the story. Every figther has a unique role and there's little possiblity of straying from that role via the talent tree. You want your archers exel at ranged combat and your freeze mages to excel at slowing down foes. That is that. I dare to say that this game suffers from a mild sort of RPG syndrome: the inclusion of RPG elements (experience bars, talent trees, interchangeable equipment) for the mere sake of it.\n\nThe developers have included many interface features that are very useful in this type of game, like being able to slow or speed up time at will or being able to reuse your previous tower layout if you failed a mission. Being able to control the game's speed at will makes for relaxed play sessions and there's even the option to scale experience points and loot rewards if you feel the pace is to slow or to fast. \n\nOne of the decisions that astonishes me is that the developers decided to hide away some content like side missions and additional dialog in new game plus (ng+) mode. Since this game's story and presentation are on the strong side (for this genre) this baffles me. I've tried my fair share of ng+ and In the way of difficulty or mechanics there isn't much that varants a second playtrough. Defender's Quest is rather the kind of game that you play through once to see the plot come to its conclusion and then move on to something else.\n\nThis game supports the Steam controller ouf of the box and the layout is quite sensical. When using it though, the game would often hang in dialog scenes or null pointer crash. No such issues presented themselves however when playing with well though out keyboard layout.\n\nAll in all, I've had my fun with Defender's Quest and I'm looking forward to see the devs expand upon it with Defender's Quest 2 which is currently in development.\n\nEdit: the game supports modding via the Steam workshop.

"review": "I think I picked a good time to play Defender\u2019s Quest: Valley of the Forgotten (Deluxe Edition). The graphics are much better, the game has improved performance, a x16 speed is included, and much more. The smart changes and relentless support make this an extremely good and content rich tower defense game. I didn\u2019t care much for the main story though, but more on that later.\n\nI rather start with the gameplay where this game shines its brightest. As you progress through the 6-hour campaign, you unlock different heroes that function as your towers. Each hero you plop down on the field has four boost levels that can be purchased. You can only place heroes on predesignated spots as the game isn\u2019t about mazing as much as thoughtful placement in a level\u2019s limited space. Each hero has a distinct role to play such as Knights being able to pierce and destroy armor or Healers keeping everyone alive since some creeps attack and casting debuffs on enemies that amplify your damage. There are six hero types in all \u2013 Berzerker, Archer, Priest, Ice Mage, Knight, Dragon \u2013 that can be used to defeat the Revenant horde.\n\nHeroes and the player character, Azra, can also be equipped with items. Azra can equip two different books that can enhance spells or affect the stage such as heroes having a free Frenzy buff when placed. Books are earned from bonus stages which are unlocked via the perfect stars earned from completing levels without letting Azra receive damage. Heroes can either equip a weapon, armor, or nothing at all. You can purchase equipment and recruit more heroes at towns. You can also earn unique items from tackling the higher difficulties for specific stages. The unique items are worth it as they can also serve a purpose in NG+\n\nNew Game Plus adds a significant amount of content for both the reading type of player or TD lover and does more than make the enemies tougher and stronger. You\u2019ll run into new side-quests that provide additional story content or jokes and run into a couple of new characters. One of them is the Hermit, a crazy person who can upgrade all the unique items you\u2019ve earned and give them new, powerful properties. There are also new developer journal entries that can be unlocked by playing if you want even more things to read. Those entries can be surprisingly interesting to read since you can see the thought process behind some of the decisions made for the game. You can also read about what the different inspirations were for other parts including the names of the unique items or the Ash religion. Both the side-quests and dev entries came with the Deluxe upgrade.\n\nRunning back and forth between the standard game and NG+ to perfect all the levels, collect uniques, and upgrade the items will probably take a bit more than 20+ hours for players if the standard settings are kept. Keep in mind that you can alter the experience, scrap (currency), and penalty rates in the accessibility menu which is a great thing indeed. Don\u2019t forget about if you ever start to feel as though the game is becoming grindy as you go back and forth between stages in order to level up or earn more money to overcome the later levels. I had my fill of the game around the 20 hour mark and have no desire to go back for the time being.\n\nNow we come to the main story. I did not enjoy the story told through the cutscenes for almost 90% of it. I thought the main antagonist, Zelemir, had some interesting qualities that were revealed during the later levels, but then there\u2019s also Slak, the Berzerker, with his loud and wacky personality that felt really forced or possibly not meant for my age group. He came off as pretty lame with his style of humor and insatiable need to murder things. Maybe I just disliked how he spoke with Capslock. I thought the writing in the journal entries were better and more interesting as were some of the side-quests in NG+. Some of the journal entries explained the main characters in more depth and made certain events much more meaningful due to understanding the significance of certain actions. Some were tainted by Slak\u2019s handwriting and jests which didn\u2019t make me laugh.\n\nFinally, I\u2019d like to cover some other parts of what this game has to offer. The game saw heavy usage of the speed multiplier from me. I didn\u2019t use the x16 multiplier very often, but man, what a time saver for when you have a solid strategy prepared for a level. You can also go in the other direction and slow down time, but I used the Pause feature instead with Spacebar. B, for boosting, is also another good hotkey to know. In addition to the x16 and performance optimizations, the game runs in 60fps which makes fast forwarding very pleasant. There is also the HD art style version of the game which is on by default now, but you can go back to the older graphics if you wanted to when you\u2019re in the overworld map. The drawings for the cutscenes are vastly improved and I wouldn\u2019t want to go back to the original. The retro aesthetics might be preferred by some people though, so it\u2019s nice that you can switch whenever.  The game is very good with all the options it offers in general. Oh, also Steam Cloud and Steam Workshop are there now.\n\nDefender\u2019s Quest is an incredibly solid TD game with enough content to keep you entertained for a while. That\u2019s assuming that the gameplay sinks its hooks into you as I don\u2019t think the story is the major draw for players, unfortunately. The accessibility options can also make the experience friendly to newer players. DQ has been one of the better Tower Defense experiences I\u2019ve had in recent memory so I hope the sequel turns out well too.", "timestamp_created": 1483957525, "timestamp_updated": 1483957525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29133874": {"recommendationid": "29133874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045160507", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497311363}, "language": "english", "review": "Tower defense done right\n\nDefender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is a typical tower defense game that is done very well.

Mechanically it's flawless, and the RPG feature which lets you build your characters and upgrade them definitely adds the charm. Overall, if you enjoy tower defense type games and have nothing better to do for few hours/days, I highly recommend trying this game. It also has a good demo, which lets you play good part of the game for free. So there is no cost of initial admission.\n\nHowever the best part of this game is the active developers. After the devs being almost dead-silence for 2 years (prepping for a next game/sequel), they returned with HD version and constant updates and patches, which are really nice. Considering the game is over 4 years old, it's nice to see dev sticking to their games. So I recommend the game.\n\nBut, I have to nitpick few things before I leave. While none of these were deal breaker for me, your mileage may differ. The story arc is generic, the characters are not really new (by which I mean you saw all of these character archetypes somewhere), and humor in game are at best reddit /r/jokes level. The game is an infinite grindfest unless you change the reward level to 200~300%, which then lets you play a fair game that allows you to progress through all levels. I like the fact that devs included option to choose your own difficulty, but why the default values so low just boggles my mind. Finally, the default graphics option is not very optimized and you should turn off some graphical settings and sprites to prevent the game choking your CPU. \n\nAll in all, it's a solid tower defense game you can enjoy for few hours/days.

Spells and character damage and placement keep you engaged during the missions, and the persistence and meta elements keep the gameplay going outside of battle.\n\nI don't generally play tower defense games for their stories, but the one in Defender's Quest isn't bad.

A thing to note is that although the description does mention RPG elements, they are very lightly dashed throughout the game and could be attributed to a pretty standard tower defense game. The most RPG-esque element that I can think of after playing through is that every new city you encounter tends to unlock new weapons and armor, which to beat the rest of the game to follow, does require that you purchase. (At least in standard play. There are some specialized modes where this does not hold true.)\n\nThere is some grinding. Some modes have more grinding than others.\nThere is some frustration; some of the levels are very, very hard. Especially if you're trying to get all of the stars.\nActually, I still don't have all of the stars. There are a few levels that are so hard that they seem impossible.

I remember that I kept humming the soundtrack for it all the time. I then forgot about the game, and soon, my laptop broke. Fast forward four years later, seeing this on sale in Steam.

Then I looked into the options and saw you can change the art style to the original one. Obviously, I picked the original, since the game feels more better that way.

In this  TD your towers are characters, that you will place on predefined maze, in order to stop the creeps from getting to Azra (the main character). The characters have persistent level ups (RPG), along side traditional tower level ups (TD), this makes that game a bit easier to manage when it comes to placing them on the battlefield. Characters automatically attack and chose which ability to attack with, unless otherwise told not to use an ability. Azra has several spells that can fight back against the oncoming hordes such as healing all placed characters and raining down fireballs to continuously burn enemies.\n\n\nIn the game Azra has been tossed into the pit for contracting the plague, which she quickly overcomes to meet a loopy swordsman. The game manages to walk that fine line between seriousness and humor throughout the campaign. As you make your journey across the over-map you gained more survivors to your band with anywhere from 7-37 characters in your company, however only 7 are story related the rest are just generic copies of Azra 6 followers. You can assign all characters in your party with names other than the default ones, and generic defenders can be assign a color schema. There is a hard level cap of 60 for all characters, therefore you will not be able to max all characters abilities (higher difficulties you will have prioritize the best move set for your characters). \n\n\nThis is game is design philosophy has the old school mentality when it comes to unlockables: new game plus that adds sidequests/challenge maps (like fighting waves upon waves of sheep), harder story maps, and journal entries, books to equip Azra, unique weapons and armor/ their upgrades. Game allows you to fine to how easy or hard you want the game to be like granting no exp upon failure, increase the speed of the game.

It's got a solid story, endearing characters, and fun writing that doesn't take itself especially seriously. The game pretty much always feels balanced and makes good use of the mechanics it's established, at least over the course of the main story.\n\nSome of the end-game challenges can be very frustrating. At one point I decided I wanted to try to 100% this game, but I could never get those last few achievements no matter how hard I tried. I was putting so much time into the game that I got tired of the soundtrack and turned off the music to play my own tunes.

For example, you can have an archer causing bleeding next to another archer causing armor-piercing damage.\n\nDevelopers released few months ago an HD update for free.

In includes RPG-like progression for your characters, with leveling and skills. Every completed level will advance the story further, and always making you wonder what's happening next.\n\nLoved the story completely. Without spoilering too much, it revolves about a plague turning people into a sort of zombie that wouldn't die, until the main protagonist Azra, who was about to die because of the plague herself, but a strange series of events granted her mysterious powers to kill these zombies called \"Revenant\" in a \"half-way world\".\nI hate Slak though (the berserker that joins your party very early in the game). If somebody would scribble into my journal, I'd DEFINITELY make sure he wouldn't do that again, may it be with spells or weapons)\n\n(I also only noticed very late on in the game, that all the archers in this game are female, but I had created \"Mitsuhide\" (myself) already then, so yeah... read that how you want, haha.)\n\nReally nice art style, in the cutscenes and ingame.\n\nGlorious soundtrack too.\n\nOnly downside in the gameplay is that you have to grind at least some times in your first playthrough (when I just wanted to see what's happening next in the story) because the level numbers really don't say anything useful about strength. So it happens that 5 defenders with level 15 can kill level 40 enemies, but 2 defenders level 15 fail on a few level 30 enemies.\n\nI will come back to this game, as it has a new game + mode.

You have to go back and play earlier levels, until you grind enough XP and money to buy a better equipment. Then the level becomes easy, and you win it no matter what tactics you use. In other words, the game rewards you not for your talent, but for the time you spend playing it.\n\nIn addition, the graphics and sound are just like from the 80's.

At first, wasn't sure how well the genres would mix. Now, I can say they mix well, at least for this game. It reminds me a lot of Shining Force meets tower defense with realtime combat. The storyline is great, and not overbearing. I enjoyed reading the cutscenes quite a bit. Good sense of humor put into the game as well. I have not beat it yet, so this is based on what I have seen a few hours in.\n\nPositives\n- Great writing/story. Enough character development to understand the story and the role you play in it. At the same time, not necessary if you just want to skip to the tower defense part (though it is worth reading, I assure you).\n- Decent variety of tower/class types to choose from. You can choose if you want to specialize in a particular type of defender rather than being forced to use them all. Like most tower defense games, you will want some variety though.\n- Many quality of life features such as individual settings to save for each defender, prompts asking if you want to place defenders in the same place as last time when repeating a map, quick sell options when upgrading equipment, dialogue skip buttons, and many more. The developers were very considerate of our time to include efficient options.\n- Good replay value. Can go back to the maps you have done before to grind or to try a more challenging version for better rewards.\n- Well composed music. The music assets are very fitting and relaxing. A great addition to an already entertaining game.\n- Very robust controls. Clear usable keyboard shortcuts for almost all functions. Many different time controls to slow down or speed up combat to a pace you are comfortable with. And of course, with the ability to pause.\n- Permanent gear and skill upgrades for the defenders. As opposed to many tower defense games, there are progression elements that will stick with your defenders between maps. Buying/earning better weapons that will stay with your defender until you upgrade helps this feel more RPGish. Skills can be retrained for a reasonable cost of in game coin.\n\nNegatives (To be honest, there are not many negative points for this game in my opinion)\n- Lacking in character customization. While I realize the game is telling a story, I would have liked the ability to choose the gender of the main character. Perhaps if the campaign is completed, there will be something after that for the end game. Not sure.\n- On the matter of customization, I would have liked to do more than just change the colors of the defenders. Hair styles, a few different faces, nothing major.\n- Not enough variety in character drawings. This one is a bit nit-picky, but I am struggling to find complaints :p The only time you really see the character drawings in a form that matters is in the cutscenes. The problem with that is the same stances and reaction drawings are recycled throughout the game. I would have liked to see a bit more unique drawings for varying situations.\n- While the music is a great asset to the game, it does not repeat or transition cleanly in some cases.\n- Some of the skill progressions at low level seem a little lackluster. For example, a 2% chance to bleed targets per hit feels a bit useless when many of these things die relatively quick. I would prefer either high chance or guaranteed trigger with low or weakened effects to balance it. Granted, I am sure these abilities work well on bosses and larger enemies.\n\nTL;DR\nA great game with a mix of RPG and Tower Defense elements. Excellent musical scores, and a good storyline to boot.

It introduces new enemies and heroes (turrets) at a comfortable and accessible rate, so you never get swamped or overwhelmed, and with 3 difficulty levels for each stage, there is plenty of replayability and opportunity to level up your team.\n\nEvery unit and enemy has visible health, damage, range, bonuses and stats readily available for you, such that there is no information or mechanics hidden from the player. You even have complete control over the timing, being able to pause the game to micromanage, or play at various speeds from 0.25x to 16x game speed.\n\nThe in-game world has enough charm, and the characters enough personality and depth, to drive the story and the gameplay progression.\n\nI say tower defense, but there are also plenty of RPG elements, such as buying and upgrading weapons and armor, upgrading abilities, and even naming your recruits and heroes, and customising the colour of your recruits' clothing. Naming your knights after King Arthurs' Court of Camelot, for example, or your Mages after your favourite magical girls, lends tremendously to immersion.\n\nThe performance is excellence on almost anything. I get around 40fps on an old dual core Thinkpad at 1152x648, thanks to the native C++ engine and the game's 2D nature.\n\nA staple of any tower defense library.

(8.75/10)\n\nThe graphics aren't the best, but they're as good as they need to be; the soundtrack and effects are pleasant but not particularly obtrusive or overwhelming. The plot itself is as interesting as it needs to be, with dialogue amusing enough to read- but all of it can be readily skipped past or ignored as one pleases. \n\nIn terms of gameplay, this is a solid tower defense/tactical RPG. LUL manages to skillfully blend the two, producing a well thought out, fairly original tower defense where one identifies with, develops, and equips one's 'towers' much as one would one's characters in games like FF Tactics or Bahamut's Lagoon. What is particularly striking about this game however, is not the gameplay itself- it's present in the gameplay, to be sure; but what really marks this game as interesting is the attention to detail the studio has given to ALL of the aspects. The graphics aren't the best, but they're every bit as good as they need to be. The plot and dialoge are easily skipped because this is a casual game, where you are not expected to care in the slightest, and yet they are still amusing and substantial enough for if you do happen to care for some reason. \n\nIf you need solid proof that LUL clearly understands you, the gamer, just look at the attention they pay to the control scheme. You can play this game without a mouse. Easily. The mouse can help now and then, but these people have dialed in the control system of their game to such an extent that a skilled player could possibly even do better without a mouse than with one, and all the keys are fully mappable, in case their super-intuitive control scheme isn't super-intuitive enough. \n\nTo be fair, I've noticed a glitch or two, but they always seem to get corrected fast enough that you would miss them if you blinked at the right moment.\n\nOverall, always good to see this level of attention being given at all levels of development. 8.75/10", "timestamp_created": 1466151373, "timestamp_updated": 1466151373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23610111": {"recommendationid": "23610111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037891977", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1374096048}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little Classic tower defense game, with nice humor.", "timestamp_created": 1466150995, "timestamp_updated": 1466150995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23608679": {"recommendationid": "23608679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089279710", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466313004}, "language": "schinese", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1466141709, "timestamp_updated": 1466141709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23608273": {"recommendationid": "23608273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030931011", "num_games_owned": 942, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466652321}, "language": "english", "review": "Good God this game is a gem!

I bought it with hesitation, very unsure of if I'd like it or not.  It's loads of fun, the story seems good so far, the characters are detailed with their own histories and little quips they say to each other, sometimes humorous.  The gameplay itself works like most TD games except you place heroes that act as your towers, and they can level up and learn new active/passive skills.  Outside of battle you can also equip them with different gear to give them better offense/defense.\n\nI got this game after they came out with the Deluxe edition (mainly upgraded visuals) and I'm glad I did.  I'm sort of a visual person, and I like what I'm playing to be pretty and polished.  I'm not sure I would have enjoyed the Standard version as much, but this free visual upgrade to Deluxe is awesome and well done.\n\nAccording to their website the devs have already started working on a DA:VF 2 and I'm pretty excited about it.  I'll definitely look into it as more info is released and most likely buy it.\n\nThis is one of the best TD/RPG hybrids I've ever played.

But now I've put in 11 hours and can safely say it's deserving of praise. I have always loved TD's and have been playing them since way back in the WC3 BNET days. In that regards it doesn't play any different than any other TD. However, the leveling up aspect is fun. Adds a grinding element which forces you to play several levels multiple times.

Diese sind in 6 unterschiedlichen Klassen mit individuellen Fertigkeitsb\u00e4umen verf\u00fcgbar.\nW\u00e4hrend einer Partie k\u00f6nnen die angeheuerten Recken mittels Psi-Energie platziert und verbessert werden.

I love the story, the characters, and world. Great accessibility menu for hardcore and more casual players alike.\n\nMy only complaint is that there is a lot of stuff in New Game+ that felt like it should've just been left in the first playthrough. A normal play through feels like a light rpg experience you might get on a mobile game. The New Game+ on the other game actually feels more like a great new addition for RPG and Tower Defense fans alike.\n\nPS- If you are a completionist, or just want to challenge yourself, there is an achievement for finishing the game without hiring any generic units. You basically have to win the game with only one of each unit type. It can be done, and I actually found the game more fun to play this way.", "timestamp_created": 1452270948, "timestamp_updated": 1452270948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20389137": {"recommendationid": "20389137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005217257", "num_games_owned": 792, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487475980}, "language": "english", "review": "I forgot I had this game and I am ashamed that I forgot I had it. I had a lot of fun playing this before, as I did just now, but it is late. I feel it deserves my thumbs up. I'll tell ya why.\n\nYou are a lady who finds people to join you and help out as the story progresses. The story is quite nice. The people are funny and will often make jokes and claim that they hate the hero, when really they don't.\n\nThe actual gameplay itself is typical of most tower defense. You have a grid where you place your units (the 'people' that joined you), and they fight when something is near. What I like about this game is that the different types of units work together. I won't go into any detail about this because you'll probably want to experience it yourself.\n\nEach level is split up into four difficulties. So if you're feeling brave, you can try the hardest. Even if you fail your units will still gain experience points. If you're feeling like a wuss, try the casual setting.\n\nThe units have skill trees which you apply 1 point on each level up.

It's worth some money and time, but I wouldn't recommend paying full price for it.\n\nThe game bills itself as primarily a tower defense game. Tower defense games generally require you to come up with a strategy to defeat the enemies given a particular map and set of resources. Defender's Quest maps are much simpler, and to a large extent don't require much strategy. That's where the \"RPG\" part comes in. There's not really any role-playing going on, but your characters get stronger and you can buy better weapons and armor for them. The maps don't rely so much on strategy as on having characters that are high enough level and have good enough equipment. And that generally means grinding for XP. So when it comes to the advanced and extreme levels, it's not that the levels are possible but you have to have a better strategy. The levels are simply impossible to start with, and the only way you can beat them is by leveling up your characters.\n\nIn short, it's not a good tower defense game (because the challenges rely primarily on having high-level characters not strategy), and it's not a good RPG (because there's no real role-playing, just \"numbers going up\" as you and the enemy gain levels and equipment). So I think it rather fails the \"tactical depth\" promise.\n\nThe second promise is customization, and it does have options to rebind all the keys and change the XP scaling, character names and colors, etc., but I don't think it's a big deal. The developer also put thought into how he could accomodate people with certain disabilities (like epilepsy), which is nice.\n\nThe third is story, and I suppose that's where this game does best. The story isn't great, but it does give a reason to keep playing and it is fairly humorous in some parts.\n\nTechnically, the game is well-made, even if it appears dated. I can't recall any bugs in the game, and it has been very stable. The game runs at 800x600 resolution, which is fine for me. The sound effects and music are well-done, but lack variety, which is okay for me.\n\nI just wish the game rewarded thinking more than it rewards grinding.

Even with few units you need to think how use them, how upgrade them, which one should get better stuff first etc. Maps and monsters are interesting. Same goes for story. While music and graphics are not so flashy, it fits really great for a game from Tower Defense genre. It inspire player to beat levels on hardest settings not only for achievements but also for stuff you can get from doing it. Also, there is one level with really annoying cute monster and it will demand from you a little knowledge on each unit skills and to come with a good strategy to beat it. There are also endless challenges so you can do your best over and over, beating your (and maybe your friends) wave scores. \nI'm glad I finally decided to play it.

While you boost the characters in battle, there also is a leveling up system in which you also add points to certain skills which actually adds a lot of depth to the game - it makes you think about what is mostly valuable of each defender and if you boost them enough for a certain skill to be used.\n\nSome enemies go straight for Azra, some try to get Azra but attack defenders along the way, some are fast, some are slow, some have armor, some have an insane amount of hit points. The come in waves from different locations in different amounts.\n\nIt all sounds pretty basic, right? \n\nWhat makes this game so special is that it introduces new variables and level designs at just the right pace; there is never too much of one thing in the game, it's never a grind, it's never repetitious. The levels were never frustrating when they were heard either; it always just made me think hard about a better defense, who should get boosted and where I need to reposition during the battle. The idea of making something challenging without making frustrating is something they absolutely nailed on this game. On the flipside, if you are convinced you have everything figured out for your defense and even need to watch - just fast foward with the 2x or 4x button (this small feature is amazing).\n\nIf you want to go back and play the battles at a high difficulty, you can do that too, which I also found the be very fun (the higher difficulty didn't just add more enemies - it also changed what types of enemies and even changes the entry points. Once again, they did a great job of preventing this game from feeling like repetitious).\n\nThe game has an accompanying story which is kind of funny sometimes. I enjoyed the animations mostly and they were well done. A minor complaint of mine would be that the humor bits would take over the unfolding of the story occasionally and got in the way. I don't feel like the story development was conitinuous enough.\n\nThe music was pretty enjoyable and fitting for the game.

This time, your \"towers\", are RPG heroes you're summoning on the battle field. This makes for a much more interesting story, with many characters voicing their opinions on what you're doing (usually to complain about it :p). The story itself isn't revolutionary, but it's servicable.\n\nUnfortunately, by making the game an hybrid of TD and RPG, Defender's Quest brings with it the bad aspects of RPG. Mostly, the grind. There will be times where you're facing a level which you simply can't win because your characters/towers aren't levelled up enough. So you will have to grind by doing other stuff (like replaying levels on a harder difficulty) before coming back. It's even more notable and grindy when you're trying to keep your adventuring party small, like the games encourages you to do (by raising recruitement prices, but also having some achievements that only unlock if you never expand your roster).\n\nAnother problem with the small roster is that in many levels, there are some optimal positions to place your 5 or 6 people, and then you're pretty much done, you fast forward to see your team hacking and slashing away for several minutes until the level is done. There are some levels where you will more active, with your main character having to use its spells, and you having to replace some of your team in better places. But on the whole, it's a rather static tower defense, since you have limited number of people, an enticement to bunch them together (for increased efficiency) and a limited mana pool to summon.\n\nAll that bad stuff being said, Defender's Quest is still way better than most tower defense. The writing is good, the levels are interesting and you can always stop at any point. The main game is pretty easy to finish, while the main game plus will offer a bigger challenge, but also new items, additional missions and optional quests to keep it fresh, and reward you for staying with the game.

"playtime_forever": 6351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479962735}, "language": "english", "review": "I wrote a review for this about a year or so ago but thought I'd rewrite it as I have some different and new views on the game.\n\nFirst off, this is a tower defense game that revolves around a well written story with a nicely done narrative that includes all the who/what/when/where/why questions, along with moments of subtle humor and despair. On the first play through you get all the character dialogue that propels the story but not a whole lot more. On the second play through you get the main character's (Azra unless otherwise named) thoughts after each mission is completed. These journal entries go pretty in-depth for being subtext you don't even need to go through. There are some 30 entries and I do recommend reading them.\n\nThe game starts with the Azra wondering where the hell she is and finding the first warrior, Slak, entering into a battle against the Revenant (the dead). The story progresses and you will find all the other characters (read 'towers'). There are six others you find and you can have up to six of them in that class, in total allowing you to have an army of 36 towers and Azra.\n\nThe Berserker is a hack 'n' slash guy. He wields a sword, wears no shirt, and thirsts for blood.\nThe Ranger is your snarky and quick witted bow expert. She often griefs Azra on menial things such as, \"not being pretty enough to have her plans work out.\"\nThe Healer comes off as overprotective and cautious but holds the team together.\nThe Ice Mage is cold and has cynical tendencies but wields the power to stop hordes of foes.\nThe Knight is rightous and pledges himself to Azra. He takes down the strongest enemies by ripping them of their armor.\nThe Dragon is the last to join the group. She acts like a god and thinks the humans beneath her yet is impressed at how far Azra and her companions have traveled thus far. She also enjoys eating sheep.\n\nWith these characters you can create varying strategies on every battlefield in the game. Some will require a near exact positioning that you'll figure out by trial and error, while others are more liberal in placement. You can pull off a ton of combos though and it's cool to find something that synergizes well.\n\nNow, along with all the characters, each has a skill branch (not tree since there are only two directions it goes) and with each level you get one point to put in each skill slot. Most of them are damage boosts for their attack tier (each character has a five tier attack that is upgraded through Psi that is earned by killing enemies in the level) and the rest are passive buffs. They can include skill cooldowns, range, crit/poison/bleed/blind/armor piercing chance, slow/stun/burn, group damage amplifiers and tagging enemies so they take more damage.\n\nAzra also has six spells she can upgrade. There are three damage and three buff spells. A direct lightning attack, an area of effect crystal explosion, and a full screen flame attack. The buffs are sending your characters into a frenzy to increase attack speed, massive healing, and pushing back waves of enemies. There are also unlockable spell books that can be equipped to provide boosts.\n\nThere are three weapons in game that two classes can use. Swords for the Berserker and Knight, a bow for the Ranger, and staffs for the Healer and Ice Mage. Progressing through the story increases the price and damage of future weapons. Armor can be equipped to them as well, heavy and light variants. \n\nThe max level each member can achieve is 60 so you won't be able to max every skill on each character. The good thing about having multiple in a class means that you can have someone with a high bleed chance, and give the other person the higher armor piercing chance. At any point you can pay a small fee of scrap (currency) to respec their builds.\n\nSo that's the gist of the game. Pretty straight forward. Where things really get rolling are on the new game +. Much more challenging and rewarding. A new currency of \"skulls\" becomes used to upgrade the special weapons and armors you aquire through missions. It's pretty hard to get all the skulls as you'll need to grind to get your characters to a high enough level to beat the much harder than before levels. There are also a few puzzles hidden here and there that you need to keep an eye out for. I had some trouble with it and found a guide and without it there would've never been a way I'd have caught on.\n\nAll in all, more than your run of the mill tower defense game, great story, fun and unique characters, scaling rewards that only get better and better through all the challenges, and tons of replayability as there is mod support. \n\nOh, if you really want a challenge, there's an achievement to beat the game and new game + with only the original characters, not using any of the extra hired ones. And then getting 180 stars (awarded through level completion).

My recomendation is to WAIT for the free HD update before playing. Go ahead and buy it now if it is on sale.\n\n\nCounter review to all the fanboy hype for this game, as I just bought it on sale since it looked good and I needed something to play on my mac book.\n\nThis is JUST any other tower defense game. Because every tower defence game has its own unique mechanics for upgrades. The only thing this game \"blends\" is RPG lore/tropes into tower defense as a theme. This is done in that you upgrade individual towers and each tower levels up on its own. That's it. The blend is just graphical, and it does that poorly because the graphics are poorly done. I don't want to be harsh because I want to give the indie devs the benefit of the doubt in that they couldn't aquire funding/talent for aethistics, but this is worse than a free flash game I could have played instead. Another problem which just elludes to really ameature/cheap UI development is that the game cannot go into fullscreen correctly. It just remains at 800x600 and the fullscreen option simply draws a giant black box on your monitor and centers teh 800x600 game. Why couldn't they have actually developed the UI before releasing it...? Not really a pleasing game to play, way better TD games imho. A game like \"Castaway Tower Defense\" has much better graphics/UI/visual-imersion than this for example and is free.\n\nAs for the writing, it is cute but not good. Some of it is just wrong regarding vocabulary which is odd since one of the selling points was that it was \"actually written by an English Major\". For example, [SPOILER]one of the bad guys loses his entire army and complains that his forces were decimated[/SPOILER]. Just bad and confusing writing, as the verb \"to decimate\" means to reduce by 10%. This is something that the Romans would do to their own troops to instill fear into them, to punish them, and to prevent rebellion. It is not something that would happen if you lose all of your army, that would be to have been obliterated or to annihilate.", "timestamp_created": 1446360621, "timestamp_updated": 1446450906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469799", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18809139": {"recommendationid": "18809139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218778733", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458308313}, "language": "english", "review": "Wait, I've already spent 50+ hrs in this game!!\nI recommend this.   :D", "timestamp_created": 1446360610, "timestamp_updated": 1446360610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18798635": {"recommendationid": "18798635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249656062", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447483441}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc7ac\ubc0c\ub2e4.\n\n\uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc2e0\ubcd1\uc5c6\uc774 \uae68\uc57c\ud558\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\ub294 \uc808\ub9dd\uc774\ub2e4.\n\n\uacf5\ub7b5\ub3c4 \ucc3e\uc744 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub2e4 \u315c_\u315c\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\uc601\uc5b4\uac00 \uc9e7\uc544 \uc624\ud574\uac00 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \n\n\ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\ub3c4 \ud560\ub9cc\ud558\ub2e4. -_-b", "timestamp_created": 1446317179, "timestamp_updated": 1447483492, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18762206": {"recommendationid": "18762206", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054680404", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 1570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448299893}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u500b\u4eba\u7684\u306b\u30aa\u30fc\u30af\u30de\u30b9\u30c8\u30c0\u30a4\u3001\u30b5\u30f3\u30af\u30bf\u30e0\u4ee5\u6765\u3001\u4e45\u3005\u306b\u3088\u304f\u3067\u304d\u305f\u9762\u767dTD\u306b\u51fa\u4f1a\u3048\u305f\n\u5358\u7d14\u306b\u8a00\u3048\u3070RPG\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u80b2\u6210\u8981\u7d20\u306b\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u304cTD\n\u6b66\u5668\u9632\u5177\u306e\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3001\u5f93\u6765TD\u3067\u5b9a\u756a\u306e\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u305f\u3081\u3066\u306e\u30a6\u30a7\u30fc\u30d6\u4e2d\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9\u3001\u30eb\u30a4\u30fc\u30c0\u306e\u9152\u5834\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u4ee5\u5916\u3067\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u3092\u96c7\u3048\u308b\u3001\uff12\u5468\u76ee\u306e\u697d\u3057\u307f\u3082\u3042\u308a\u307e\u3059\n\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u306e\u540d\u524d\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u5165\u529b\u3082\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\n\u898b\u305f\u76ee\u306b\u591a\u69d8\u6027\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c\n\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u80b2\u6210\u8981\u7d20\u304c\u3042\u308b\u3060\u3051\u3067\u697d\u3057\u3044\u697d\u3057\u3044\n\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u5931\u6557\u3057\u3066\u3082\u7d4c\u9a13\u5024\u304c\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u306b\u5165\u308b\u3093\u3067\u7121\u99c4\u306b\u306f\u306a\u3089\u305a\n\u3044\u3064\u304b\u306f\u8ab0\u3067\u3082\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3067\u304d\u308b\u3067\u3057\u3087\u3046\n\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u9762\u3092\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3059\u308b\u3068\u5404\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u3054\u3068\u306b\u826f\u3044\u88c5\u5099\u54c1\u304cGET\u3067\u304d\u305f\u308a\n\u7d9a\u3051\u308b\u6c17\u306b\u306a\u308c\u308b\u8272\u3093\u306a\u8981\u7d20\u3092\u3061\u308a\u3070\u3081\u3066\u3044\u308b\n\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u4e8b\u306f\u4f55\u4e00\u3064\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\n\u3057\u304b\u3057\u8003\u3048\u3089\u308c\u308b\u5145\u5b9f\u3092\u8aa0\u5b9f\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3057\u3066\u308b\u826f\u3044\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u3059", "timestamp_created": 1446206167, "timestamp_updated": 1454749932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18666134": {"recommendationid": "18666134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009813290", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 1870, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451615297}, "language": "ukrainian", "review": "This is an ok little defense title, if not much more than a glorified flash game.

The protagonist is a librarian cast into a plague colony, and sets out on a quest to escape. She quickly discovers latent supernatural powers that allow others to defeat the zombified infected. She serves as the objective that must be defended. Besides the standard ability to summon units to defend her, she's also capable of casting spells for harming or buffing, and can equip spell books to further enhance her abilities.\n\nThroughout the game you'll encounter characters who join with you, unlocking new classes of characters (berserker, archer, healer, etc.) that you can hire and summon to defend you. The classes come with simple skill trees that unlock new abilities or enhance them in some way, and every individual unit can be leveled differently from the other, enabling a more diverse army to choose from.\n\nThe game is made for a wide variety of skill levels. New players and seasoned veterans alike will find something to challenge them when the game gets rolling, and you can replay maps as you please for practice or for XP/money. The map's rewards are better for higher difficulty settings, and can reward unique equipment for success. The game can seem like a grindfest, but the devs wisely included the option to increase XP/money gains and to ensure all units get equal access to it, regardless of whether or not they entered battle.\n\nThe story itself is very competent. The characters are largely likeable and the writing and humor is enjoyable. The cast tend to have something of an emphasis on their quirks, but mostly avoid becoming bland one notes with varying degrees of depth.\n\nThe game is not without its flaws. Completionists can find that the New Game+ might become something of a chore, the skill trees are rather simple in their execution, and certain parts of the story or characters can become tiresome (looking at you, Slak). If you can put this aside, you still have a fun and funny game that's worth a look. Grab the demo and give it a spin.

I used to play Warcraft III custom maps where the tower defense genre was cut from. Defender's Quest does a nice job of putting a well developed story with well developed characters into tower defense gameplay without it feeling pasted on. \n\nIt keeps it simple. There are only a few basic towers to choose from, but each tower acts like a character in your party and you can equip most of them with weapons and armor (no weapons or armor for a dragon and no armor for the barbarian/main melee guy). The maps are laid out well enough that consideration to where to place your troops does make a big difference.\n\nThere is also a nice take on the gameplay by offering 4 difficulty levels. You get rewards for completing the level, but you get bonus rewards for not taking a single point of damage. If you do that, you can get a lot of extra scrap (money) and unique items.\n\nWhat I'm doing on my second playthrough is going as far as I possibly can while only buying recruits and never any items on the easiest mode. When I hit my first failure, I go back to the very start and try to complete each level on the hardest mode possible. After I fail once, I will go down to an easier mode and so on until I am right back at the easiest mode and therefore, the furthest out I've ever been.\n\nThe main game is not that long and there isn't a ton of replayability to this game once you complete it. That is why it is only worth a few bucks...but it's worth a few bucks. I hear they are making a Defender's Quest II and I hope that is at least as good.

It's not a deal-breaker, but it does take away from game to some extent. I know that the Deluxe HD Update has been released, but the art style still looks primitive.

This is most likely the biggest surprise in my entire library. \n\nI originally bought this game about two years ago. The Steam Trading Card system  had just launched into beta (remember when everyone thought it was going to be huge and a card could be worth $5?) and I had gotten in. Curious to test the system out, I found I at the time did not own any games on the short list of applicable games. I immediately did two things. First, I purchased Half-Life 2 since I had played that game on another account and knew it was good. Second was I started scanning the list for cheap games. This was on a daily deal sale the following day. \n\nI checked it out and saw that is seemed like a pretty generic, if solid, tower defense game. Felt like one of those particularly good flash games on something like Kongregate or Armor Games. Still, for 5 bucks, I figured it was worth a shot. \n\nAnd I wasn't entirely wrong in my expectations. This does very much feel like a buffed up flash game in a lot of ways. And then I asked myself if that was a bad thing. The gameplay is simple and understandable yet plenty difficult. Creativity is encouraged and different strategies will be required. The graphics weren't amazing, certainly not HD (though a HD update is on its' way at time of writing) but I feel like the art has character to it. This of course is helped by the fact that there actuually is a solid storyline in the game, more than many games I've played. The characters don't have a lot of screentime for development, yet I still feel like they are real. \n\nAll in all, this game I found to be a very good surprise. Don't expect a AAA level game, but do expect a game whose simple charm and solid gameplay will leave you satisfied. This game doesn't amaze, but it does the one thing that all games have to do. It's simply entertaining. The devs (who btw are super communicative and dedicated to their games) really did a great job with this one, and I look forward to their future work. \n\n9/10 - Highly Reccomended", "timestamp_created": 1434221839, "timestamp_updated": 1434221839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585527", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16350835": {"recommendationid": "16350835", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997537239", "num_games_owned": 421, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1405056689}, "language": "english", "review": "An enjoyable RPG-Tower Defense hybrid.

I wasn't smart enough to stop.\n\n(1)  The tower defense gameplay was poor.  The appeal of tower defense games is usually to try and optimize your defense to be efficient and effective as possible against the oncoming force.   In Defender's Quest there are very few places where your characters can be placed rationally.  In other words, there was only one strategy to place your characters when you setup.  Since there were no other real elements to the game, this made it very boring.  When you lost a mission, you couldn't try and refine your process as there was nothing to refine.  You just needed to level up to get stronger.\n\n(2)  The character leveling up process was poor.  I decided to buy the game because the game boasted an RPG leveling-up process.  Although this is technically true, you DO HAVE TO CLICK A BUTTON in order for them to get more powerful, it could have been done automatically as your choices were thin, uncreative, and obvious.  Again, there was no game element in it.  You put the point where it was supposed to go and done.\n\n(3)  The storyline was not worth it.  I don't remember the storyline other than it seemed shallow.  The characters were the best part of the game.  Each character seemed unique and full of personality, but the storyline needed more to take away from the poor gameplay.  Because I liked the characters and I thought they were unique, it was a big letdown to find out later that you get more characters just like them gameplay wise.  Here you thought you had a unique crazy berserker guy or a badass ice mage, but no, they are just one of many.\n\n(4)  The enemies were uncreative.  The enemies were similar across the board.  At no point do you need to change your strategy based on the different types of enemies coming our way.    Some tower defense games have VERY uncreative enemies, but they don't need varied enemies as the game element is in the placing of the towers/characters, abilities, and tower synergy.

The characters are distinctive, fun and memorable. 7/10\n\nGameplay:  The gameplay is solid Tower Defence with light RPG elements. You equip and level up your heroes, which you place as towers to fight off the waves of encroaching enemies. Placement is key, such as placing your ice mages a good distance from your fire-breathing dragons as their abilities will counteract one another, or ensuring your knights will be able to shatter the enemy armour before your archers rain down their arrows for maximum impact. 9/10\n\nGraphics: Simple, pixelated graphics are stylistic and get the job done but have been done better elsewhere. Sprites look good, environments are dull and a bit repetitive. The cut-scene art is fantastic. 6/10\n\nSound/Music: The sound effects are basic and appropriate to the pixelated presentation. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is superb. 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1430824076, "timestamp_updated": 1433196560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15694430": {"recommendationid": "15694430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102910418", "num_games_owned": 458, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 914, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431126361}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e", "timestamp_created": 1430797352, "timestamp_updated": 1430797352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15592534": {"recommendationid": "15592534", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988112799", "num_games_owned": 2565, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430197199}, "language": "english", "review": "I usually think tower defense is very repetitive and not so much fun but this game is different...", "timestamp_created": 1430197254, "timestamp_updated": 1430197254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15580916": {"recommendationid": "15580916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070927422", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1357632000}, "language": "english", "review": "A well made tower defense game with a good story and hilarious characters and dialogue.", "timestamp_created": 1430143548, "timestamp_updated": 1430143548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15569514": {"recommendationid": "15569514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094842448", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419115689}, "language": "english", "review": "GOTTA LOVE DAT DEFENDIN", "timestamp_created": 1430082630, "timestamp_updated": 1430082630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15555539": {"recommendationid": "15555539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023992910", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 3813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489102439}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0443\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 tower-defence. \n+ \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044e\u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043a \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u044f\u0433\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442;

Each class a page out of a classic RPG history book, they each carry their own bevy of abilities based on the type (Berzerker, Archer, etc.) that will bolster your defenses either for the better or worse depending on placement and Psi investment. Characters may earn EXP by being used in battle, growing levels as the criteria becomes met and allowing the player to invest skill points into a basic (yet vital) skill tree.\n\nThe overall feel of this game is very old-school, but executes sleekly by today's standards. The World Map (level select screen) features a beautiful score, quite reminiscent of early RPG soundtracks. Interestingly enough, the site for Defender's Quest 2 claims to have musical talent brought forth from none other than Nobuo Uematsu himself. One of the millions (billions?) of Final Fantasy players and avid enjoyers of their dynamic, emotionally-captivating soundtracks, this notion that an industry veteran so well known is working with an indie developer brings me hope for the future generations of gaming. Imagine the experience this renowned professional can impart upon this team, and how this team may in turn inspire Nobou Uematsu, thusly conceiving the music that highlights some of gaming's most touching and well-loved moments. Relationships like these in the game industry are vital for its continuation as the younger generations may offer fresh ideas while in turn being nurtured by the experience and wisdom of seasoned developers having been in the industry since its near-conception (decades, folks!). I sincerely hope that veteran talent continues to  reach out to budding indie developers like Level Up Labs who clearly have a passion for delivering a lasting entertainment experience that is indeed inspiring to all. \n\nI thoroughly enjoy every moment I spend playing this game, and there is a very high probability that you will, too.\n\n*Reading Rainbow Transition*", "timestamp_created": 1426728091, "timestamp_updated": 1426728091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14950509": {"recommendationid": "14950509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032896249", "num_games_owned": 1188, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495058383}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice tower defense.\nWorth to buy for a few \u20ac\u20ac when it's on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1426706349, "timestamp_updated": 1426706349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14949830": {"recommendationid": "14949830", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993689169", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427108704}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game!

I don't even remember why I decided to try the game on a whim but I'm SO glad I did. The story is interesting and, even better, funny. There's tons of really good characters and the devs have done a good job of creating a story that walks the line between silly and serious pretty well. \n\nIn terms of the gameplay, like I said -- I don't particularly enjoy tower defense, mostly because the ones I've played previous to this have all seemed far too complicated to be worth the time and effort. Prior to Defender's Quest, the game that I've enjoyed the most in the genre was Plants vs. Zombies. Defender's Quest is a step above that, really, because DQ actually attempts to have a story and character development, though the basic goals of the two games are the same. I'd say DQ is a little bit tougher than PvZ, if only because there's a lot more variability in the maps, whereas PvQ was a fairly straight-forward flat plain. DQ offers maps with multiple enemy spawn points (three is the most I've seen so far), different terrain (e.g., water vs. land), and various restrictions in routes for enemies (and placement for allies). I especially enjoyed the way you can change battle speed to slow down -- or pause -- the enemies spawning to catch up or speed up (4X is amazing) if you're sure your allies can handle the enemies without much management. It's a nice mix that I liked, because I prefer to micro-manage at the start, rather than during the battle. Even better is the different battle difficulty settings, so you can go back and replay battles on a harder setting (same map, different enemies) PLUS bonus challenges and (so the achievements would suggest) a new game plus mode -- means there's tons of stuff to do. Playing DQ actually makes me want to go out and find similar tower  defense games to play because I enjoyed this one so much -- which is probably the best compliment I can give a game!", "timestamp_created": 1424618135, "timestamp_updated": 1424618135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14572431": {"recommendationid": "14572431", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102385608", "num_games_owned": 2501, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 1329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424507045}, "language": "russian", "review": "Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten -

Hailing to the final fantasy tactics series with its strategic character placement and pixel art sprites. The unique blend of tactical RPG and Tower defence mechanics offers something familiar but fresh. With a fully customisable cast of characters and intricate levelling system, Defenders Quest is a western effort to try reinvent a diluted genre.\n\nYou play as the heroine Azra, the former royal librarian of the Ash Kingdom who is exiled to the ruinous outskirts of the city when found dying from the plague. On the brink of death, Azra awakens in a purgatory state to be attacked by a swarm of zombie like creatures or 'Revenant', and by using newly acquired magic and the assistance of a fellow surviving berserk mercenary \u2013 you journey through the Pit to uncover the secrets of these creatures and the valley. As you progress you accumulate a small army of companions of different class from swordsman, archers and dragons to face off against a number of tyrants to free the land from the plague. \n\nThe game primarily revolves around a linear story driven campaign that places you in the overworld of the pit. From here you enter battles that charge waves of enemies at you from designated points, trying to reach and attack Azra. To defeat each wave you tactically place your available units across the map using your Psi resource to do so. Each unit has unique abilities and resistances to overcome each wave. You can also recall and reposition each unit, but this consumes further Psi. Azra also has a host of abilities that can boost her own units and fend off the waves of enemies. Each battle has 3 levels of difficulty and as you progress on normal you can revisit a previous battle to gain further XP and stars.\nThe Overworld also acts as a hub for towns and lairs. Before battles you can visit these locations to recruit units or purchase more effective weapons and armour. \nYou can also complete bonus levels that offer intense challenges for greater reward after gaining enough stars. \n\nDefenders Quest is highly accessible but introduces a depth to tower defence that elevates it requiring the player to strategize and carefully consider how each unit is levelled and their positioning in battle. The character development is clearly influenced by role playing games, whilst removing the repetition and time associated with grinding. This effectively ensures your steady progression through the story whilst each battle holds new challenges.\nThe narrative is also highly original and maintains intrigue and invention that is expected of a good RPG. Azra is the sympathetic protagonist facing off against an unknown villainy. \nThe ability to pause a battle at any time emphasises the necessity to properly prepare your units placing them in the most effective positions and levelling them appropriate to the incoming enemies.\nThe game aesthetic is very nostalgic, calling back to the pixel art of classic JRPGs such as Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger. Each recruit can also have a custom name and colours, allowing you to personalise your army.\nThe main campaign is appropriately paced across seven acts, but encourages you to revisit past levels for bonus equipment and increased challenge. You can complete your army with any class of your choice as their unlocked, further increasing the range of tactics when battling and tailoring your strategies the units you've selected. \n\n\nThe breadth and uniqueness of the story is commendable and gives engrossing context to the battles. However the static cut-scenes through which its told at times become unnecessarily prolonged and tedious, after the initial character introductions we generally skipped through them to get to the battles. \nFurthermore there is a distinct characterised design to the figures in these scenes which drastically differs to the more befitting pixel models. This lack of consistency is also noticeable against the painterly backdrops.\nDefenders Quest is strongly reminiscent of its influences, but also tries to introduce a more detailed textured interpretation of its characters, that unfortunately leaves to big a void in the games overall presentation.\n\nWhat starts out as a charming and casual game soon evolves into a challenge. \nUnlike most tower defence games there is no such thing as the ultimate deployment to beat every level. Each battle requires a unique strategy, that sometimes requires you to fine tune each unit. \n\nWhilst tower defence remains primarily a casual genre, Level up Labs have crafted a game with a refined battle system and immersive world that requires a fair investment of the players time. Through adapting existing RPG conventions and introducing a few new parameters, Defenders Quest's perilous journey is worthy of the most battle-hardened players.\n\nWatch at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KVFiflbRco", "timestamp_created": 1423311402, "timestamp_updated": 1423311402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14356521": {"recommendationid": "14356521", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970716737", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423250887}, "language": "english", "review": "This is easily one of the best Tower Defense games ever made.

The characters are bright and cartoony, and their dialogue is marked with sass. Their battle sprites display whimsical touches, like the ranger who spins her bow before firing. One of the promotional spellbooks Azra can equip, the Book of Face, introduces the Internet's beloved Trollface to the otherwise sword-and-sorcery setting. Focusing on the one-liners would be simple, as they are good. However, the core plot has heft: it would make a good Dungeons and Dragons campaign or fantasy adventure novel. Royal librarian Azra must survive in a quarantine pit the size of a small nation, while she's pursued by mysterious figures. It features conspiracy, betrayal, and explosions. Careful gamers shouldn't be surprised a USDA-certified English major wrote the script. The wacky comedy and childish in-fighting among Azra's companions allows the team to quickly bond. These light-hearted intra-party friendships and feuds add personal stakes to the more pervasive dangers of the pit. The story is delivered in slideshow style before every town and battle, tying the narrative neatly to combat.\n\nCombat is handled like a tower defense game. Enemies travel in waves from spawn points. As they walk into the attack range of stationary heroes, they suffer the effects of the heroes' attacks. The heroes are unable to move from where they're summoned, as they're doing combat on a spiritual plane where bodies just get in the way. The cornerstone of battle strategy comes from placing the six types of heroes in the appropriate location. After recruiting story characters (such as Slak, the madcap, murderous berserker), faceless extras of the same type become hirable. If that's all there was to combat, it would be a delightful diversion. However, each character gains experience points, which can be spent to learn new combat skills or boost existing ones. Once learned, most of these skills can't be used immediately. Characters must be boosted in battle, which draws from the same Psi pool Astra uses to summon allies and cast spells of her own. It can be a challenging balancing act to position the proper allies, keep them boosted, reposition troops to respond to new threats, and maintain wide scale battlefield control with Azra's spells. Thankfully, slowing the game's speed (and pausing it altogether) are simple options. The keyboard commands are simple to learn and encourage faster play, but nothing's wrong with the mouse either.\n\nWith all the moving parts that go into battle, the multiple levels of accessibility are a nice touch. Each character has nine different attack modes including \"attack the strongest enemy\" and \"attack the enemy with least immunity to status effects.\" Understanding the interplay between these attack modes isn't necessary for most of the core game, but integral to completing the optional levels. Furthermore, failure isn't necessarily punished. The default settings infer experience and money penalties for losing battles, but these can be changed based on individual preference. Redistributing skill points to explore different character builds costs money, but not a fortune. The steepest cost is the time it takes to click through all the advancements. The largest concession to the casual-vs.-hardcore debate is the option to increase experience points. Players who care more for the story and the thrill of rapid advancement can run with it. Players who want their hardcore bragging rights can lift their noses at the low-hanging fruit. True challenge-jockeys can set their sights on the more exclusive achievements, many of which are challenging even with gushing wells of experience points.\n\nDefender's Quest is a short game, but provides plenty of options to extend the experience. Completing every level at the highest difficulty takes about twenty hours; increasing the experience and money levels in the options decreases the playtime. However, the New Game+ mode, which becomes available after completing the base game, adds considerable challenge. The core story stays the same, but combat's modified with new enemy powers, new maps, and new bonus stages. The New Game+ also provides a delicious means of upgrading the magic items earned in the core game, unlocking unique modifiers for each relic. As enjoyable as these new features are, Azra's journal is the best addition to the New Game+. After every major battle, Azra updates her journal with commentary on the story. In the process, she details her internal struggles and fleshes out the world. The extra character moments in Azra's journal are enjoyable enough that their inclusion as bonus material seems strange. They'd serve the story better as part of its body rather than as bonus material.\n\nIn spite of all this praise, Defender's Quest isn't perfect. Despite the snap and crackle of the script, it features several glaring spelling and punctuation errors--especially in Azra's journal. Purchasing equipment isn't as interesting as other elements of character customization, but the numerical benefits encourage frequently clicking through upgrades. The music is initially encouraging, but loops quickly. Thankfully, it can be toggled independently of the sound effects, which provide texture and valuable combat cues. The final battle song is a notable exception. That beast should be blasted loud and proud.\n\nBetween its addictive gameplay and sliding difficulty scale, Defender's Quest offers gamers a great deal for such a small investment of time. It probably won't make a true believer out of anyone whose parents were killed by tower defense games, but it's good at what it does: drawing people in and refusing to let them go until they've finished \"just one more level.\"\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=387148680\n\n[h1][b]Highly Recommended[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1423104685, "timestamp_updated": 1485059846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.729809", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14302713": {"recommendationid": "14302713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050478086", "num_games_owned": 1310, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 1112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498816636}, "language": "english", "review": "Defender's quest is a mix of a tower defense + rpg elements and the result is a very addictive game.\nYou're Azra royal librarian casted into the pit because you got the plague, but for some reason you get a strange vision about a golden man and discover new powers capable of destroying revenants for good, now gathering new allies you on a search trying to get out of the pit for your freedom, but also learning why you're special.\nDuring the game you will unlock a total of 6 classes of heroes each with different pros and cons, archers low dmg but great range, knight high dmg but slow attack speed, berserker high attack speed medium dmg, ice priest area attacks with crow control skills, priest healer and buffer and dragons overally awesome.\nThere's a total of 30 levels each can be replayed on higher difficulties for more rewards (xp or unique gear for your defenders) but doing higher difficulties requires higher leveled defenders so they can unlock/upgrade skills and passives, unlike other TD games you upgrade the hero to give him a bonus in all stats and unlock his following active skill, which requires previously to level them up outside, kind of confusing but easy to understand as soon as you can see it.\nThere's a set of really hard achievements such as get 180 gold stars without buying generic heroes, reaching wave 100 on endless challenge, and killing a extremely overpowered sheep.\nOnce you beat the game newgame+ gets unlocked, tougher waves, newer gear, 7 side quests which some of them add a lot to the plot, journal logs after every level for more detailed lore about Azra's thoughs about everything than been happening, and items to upgrade the unique gear obtained from doing 3 star levels in normal play, can switch back and forth between both styles at will.\nHighly recommended even at full price, good TD system and interesting storyline with some (a lot) of funny scenes, i even played 4 hours on a row without even realizing.", "timestamp_created": 1422915224, "timestamp_updated": 1422915224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500072", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14288503": {"recommendationid": "14288503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068981796", "num_games_owned": 337, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485598365}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the best tower-defense game I've ever played plus the RPG element in this game made it interesting enough to hook you into playing for long hours.", "timestamp_created": 1422832323, "timestamp_updated": 1456971477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14237175": {"recommendationid": "14237175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006667338", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422604769}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't let the simple graphics fool you.

Still visuals are not important here.\nWhat is important is gameplay. What can I say, it's brilliant. You're placing heroes, of few classes, on battle field, changing tactic with each new level. Characters varies, have nice skills, synergize well. With each battle they gain experience points which leads to new levels and skill points, making your heroes stronger. It adds a little grind to classic Tower Defense game. You can revisit once done levels, increasing it's difficulty to gain bonuses. And then, after the game is over, there is new game plus, making things even more complicated.\nYou will have Dragon in your team and you will kill sheeps!\nStory starts suddenly, with our protagonist Azra, just like us, surprised with events that occurs. With time we will learn about plague and revenants, will find out who is the villain. It's nothing ground-breaking but is good excuse to continue the adventure. There is even a moral decision!\nThe key part is the dialogues. They're simply amazing. Heroes are crazy so we ends up with many fun jokes, that will leave you with minutes of laugh. There are few misses, still author's sense of humor turns out to be very good. Good stuff.\n\nDefender's Quest is great game. Fantastic example of how well Tower Defense can work with RPG.

See Conclusion[/h1]\n\n[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]\nDefender Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is a 2D game with a unique blend of TD and RPG from Level Up Labs. It features characters / companions who act as 'towers' and need to be strategically placed around the map to defend your main character Azra. Unlike a tower defense game, however, you can level up and equip items for your companions to help them improve in combat.\n\nYou take the role of Azra, a royal librarian of the Kingdom of Ash which is currently being ravaged by a plague. Azra gets infected and thrown into 'The Pit', a place where all dead or dying are placed to keep the kingdom safe because those who die from the Plague become 'Revenants', undead monsters that are immune to physical harm. Azra soon discovers that she has the power to enter both the living world and the 'Half-Way' world, a place between the living realm & the realm of the dead. In this realm, she can summon her companions to fight the Revenants in their spirit form and eventually kill them.\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n+ Refreshing new mix of genres\n+ 8-bit sprite art style that works well with the game\n+ Character / Companion progression is deep and extensive\n+ Well designed Maps and Mazes\n+ Very challenging difficulty levels\n+ 6 base classes (towers) which can progress into different builds depending on your play-style\n+ Dialogues between characters are humorous\n+ Steam Workshop support\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n- Cutscene art work could use a lot of improvement (especially the character designs)\n- Story is a bit weak\n- Balance issues (some classes are outright better than others)\n- Some necessary but boring grinding sessions to progress\n- No real 'HD' or Widescreen Support\n- No Steam Cloud Support\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\nIt is a GOOD GAME and one of the better tower defense games out there. I can easily recommend this game if you're looking for a challenging and unique game since it mixes RPG elements to the tried-and-tested Tower Defense genre. The 8-bit sprites, animations and effects are nice and work well with the game's art style although the Cutscene artwork could really use improvements. The levels are very well planned and are fun to play. Finally, the in-game dialogue between your companions is funny and quite entertaining.\n\nI can easily RECOMMEND this game even at full price since it\u2019s only $14.99 or your regional equivalent. With simple graphics, this game is not system requirement heavy and can easily run even on netbook computers making this a perfect game when you're on vacation, working, passing the time, or in any other situation where you are not with your main gaming system.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n[h1]Like my Reviews?

Com as torres, voc\u00ea deve impedir que os inimigos avancem at\u00e9 a protagonista (que fica est\u00e1tica), e lhe causem dano. S\u00e3o seis classes de personagens, com caracter\u00edsticas pr\u00f3prias. Cada classe tem um personagem principal, que aparecer\u00e1 nas cutscenes, mas \u00e9 poss\u00edvel recrutar mais personagens gen\u00e9ricos, totalizando seis torres de cada classe. \u00c9 poss\u00edvel vendar as torres ou realoc\u00e1-las, bem como fazer upgrade conforme se ganha recursos matando os inimigos. O n\u00famero de torres que voc\u00ea pode usar em cada fase \u00e9 determinado por quantas voc\u00ea conseguiu via hist\u00f3ria ou comprando. Ao concluir uma fase, ganha-se experi\u00eancia para sua personagem principal e para os demais, e com isso pontos que podem ser distribu\u00eddos em uma \u00e1rvore de talentos, sendo que habilidades mais avan\u00e7adas requerem pontos nas anteriores. Durante as fases, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio fazer upgrade das torres para ter acesso \u00e0s habilidades mais avan\u00e7adas, compradas na \u00e1rvore de talentos. No caso da personagem principal, pontos s\u00e3o distribu\u00eddos em magias, adquiridos conforme a hist\u00f3ria progride, e que podem ser usadas durante a fase, como raios que destroem inimigos, aumentar a velocidade de ataques das \"torres\" ou cur\u00e1-las (alguns inimigos causam dano a elas). Tamb\u00e9m se pode equipar itens na protagonista e nas torres, que aumentam suas estat\u00edsticas ou d\u00e3o habilidades especiais passivas. Esses itens podem ser comprados com recursos do jogo ou adquiridos em fases. N\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel fazer maze nesse jogo, isto \u00e9, o percurso dos inimigos e pr\u00e9-definido e n\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel inserir as torres em qualquer lugar. Voc\u00ea pode jogar as fases em quatro n\u00edveis de dificuldade, que d\u00e3o de uma a quatro estrelas, sendo que os mais dif\u00edceis d\u00e3o mais experi\u00eancia e melhores itens, mas somente completando os n\u00edveis mais f\u00e1ceis \u00e9 que a hist\u00f3ria avan\u00e7a. \u00c9 poss\u00edvel revisitar as fases posteriormente para tentar bater os n\u00edveis mais dif\u00edceis de dificuldade e ganhar seus b\u00f4nus e estrelas. Conforme se ganha mais estrelas, desbloqueia-se algumas \u201cfases-desafio\u201d, que d\u00e3o itens poderosos.\n\nHIST\u00d3RIA: A hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 legal, mas tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o \u00e9 espetacular. Achei interessante como justificaram personagens de fantasia batalhando com monstros em formato de TD. Tem humor e personagens legais, mas \u00e0s vezes o humor \u00e9 for\u00e7ado. Eu gosto de games com hist\u00f3ria, mas acho que exageraram ao colocar di\u00e1logos sempre antes e depois de todas as batalhas (d\u00e1 para pular as cenas). Os personagens s\u00e3o diferentes um do outro e t\u00eam seu charme. Convenhamos que hist\u00f3ria em jogo de TD \u00e9 um b\u00f4nus, apesar de que a hist\u00f3ria saiu-se melhor do que eu esperava \uf04a. Tem dois finais diferentes, baseados em uma escolha que se faz pr\u00f3ximo do fim do jogo.\n\nREJOGABILIDADE: Ap\u00f3s terminar o jogo, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel continuar pelo mapa batendo as fases nos n\u00edveis mais dif\u00edceis. Depois pode-se exportar os personagens para o New Game +, onde algumas coisas mudam. No NG+ a dificuldade aumenta, os itens vendidos s\u00e3o mais poderosos e \u00e9 poss\u00edvel fazer upgrade em itens \u00fanicos adquiridos na campanha. Esses upgrades n\u00e3o s\u00e3o feitos com dinheiro, mas sim trocando itens adquiridos ao finalizar as fases, sendo que alguns s\u00f3 podem ser conseguidos batendo os n\u00edveis mais dif\u00edceis. Uma coisa legal do NG+ \u00e9 que tem side quests, com desdobramentos da hist\u00f3ria, onde somente se pode usar alguns personagens pr\u00e9-definidos, e conseguir bons itens. Algumas conquistas s\u00e3o dif\u00edceis de conseguir, e podem deixar o jogador entretido at\u00e9 o NG++. H\u00e1 conquistas de terminar os game (sem comprar torres gen\u00e9ricas, o que acarretaria em finalizar o game no NG, NG+ e NG++ novamente. Digo isso porque tamb\u00e9m h\u00e1 conquistas de conseguir todas as estrelas, e fazer isso sem os gen\u00e9ricos \u00e9 bem complicado (acho que imposs\u00edvel).\n\nPRE\u00c7O: comprei o game de promo\u00e7\u00e3o.

Les graphismes sont vieillots, et font tr\u00e8s console pixelis\u00e9e (pas de mode plein \u00e9cran ?), mais c'est ce qui fait tout son charme, un vrai jeu \"Effet Vintage\", un peu comme Final Fantaisy Tactis, mais en moins Tactical RPG peut-\u00eatre , avec un gameplay assez r\u00e9tro. L'histoire et la trame narrative sont assez int\u00e9ressants pour \u00eatre signal\u00e9s, et se d\u00e9roulent comme un film d'animation en th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'ombres, sc\u00e8nes par sc\u00e8nes, avec dialogues et expressions des protagonistes, de fa\u00e7on assez soign\u00e9s, au point qu'il est difficile de dire ce qui fait son attrait, pourtant bien pr\u00e9sent, et ce malgr\u00e9 une histoire en anglais uniquement (pour ma part) qui ne pose pas vraiment de difficult\u00e9s. Un d\u00e9fi technique relev\u00e9 avec brio et peu de moyens, un retour aux sources du genre qui fait du bien et \u00e0 contre-courant du ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne de mode des pseudo-A-Rts actuels parfois vite lassants.

Si par contre vous vous \u00eates lass\u00e9 rapidement sur Plants vs Zombies, la dur\u00e9e de vie peut vite chuter, car il me semble qu'il vaut mieux aimer le genre pour s'en satisfaire sur la dur\u00e9e...:\n\n\nLes + :                                                                                  \n\n\u25a0 Histoire  int\u00e9ressante et humoristique\npersonnages attachants (le barbare cingl\u00e9 y joue pour beaucoup),\nm\u00eame si elle ne sert que d'excuse pour amener au Tower Defense.\n\n\u25a0  R\u00e9alisation simple et efficace, interface intuitive et bien pens\u00e9e, \non est en face d'un vrai Tower Defense pour tous (HCG et Casu).

Only a few gripes make this game short of perfect.\n\nLong: \"Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten\" is a Tower Defense game in which you fight hordes of enemies by using different classes and spells. The classes (of which there are 6) all differ in playstyle and give the game its RPG elements via XP gains, talent trees and weapon/armor aquisition. Even though the game looks simple, it offers a very deep combat and leveling system which will have to be adjusted multiple times in order to beat certain levels. Examples include making your archers target fastest enemies first, putting the stun sword in the hands of your knight, or making sure your ice skills don't get cancelled by your burn ones.  The story itself is amusing as well and gave me a few chuckles along the way. New Game+, 3 star rating per level, and challenges such as endless mode only extend the life of this game and make you want to play more. \n\nThere are however, a few issues. Some, like the \"Undo\" button, which removes ALL the points you just put into your character's skill tree instead of just the last one, should be renamed \"Restart\" because that's what it actually does. This gets very annoying when respeccing a character with 60 points in New Game+. However, the \"Undo\" button is not game breaking so it doesn't change my rating of the game. What does, however, is the terrible frame drop encountered during big fights. Even though I have a very powerful rig, it has caused the game to crash several times (once while on 95th wave of endless when attempting 100 wave achievement!). Another is the poor visual of the cursor, which when coupled with the fact the frame rates drop, makes it impossible to see. This has caused me to lose a few games or constantly pause to execute commands.\n\nBut the few imperfections get dwarfed by the fact this is a great game, and had me coming back for that \"JUST ONE MORE ROUND\" feel.

(In fact, functionally impossible at the hardest versions of some levels. Fortunately, you don't need 100% completion for those.) \n\nThe game is also pausable, for those who find some tower defense games too frantic to enjoy.

But I do love tower defense, and it runs on linux, so I went ahead with the purchase. Very impressed, this game is actually very excellent and has an old-school SNES feel with modern tower defense. I've been playing it over more publicly accredited games (it actually has pulled me away from DOTA 2), so decided that a positive review would help out a bit because I feel very strongly about how this hidden gem wasted an entire Sunday for me, and I'm still not done beating it 100%. I rarely care about beating games 100%, I think the last time I did it was for a little-known title called Goldeneye in the 90's.\n\n\nExcellent concept: merges RPG with tower defense. That's all there is to say, really. Units seem to be all useful, but as with ANY old-school RPG combat it can get super easy or impossible depending on whether or not you grind. Regardless on that, there are technically four difficulties (if you count casual) that change each battle's difficulty hugely. Story is alright -- the humor isn't my cup of tea, but then again, I have a picture of the dude from The Human Centipede 2 as my steam picture, so I just gotta say it's a me thing.\n\nLooks like they're making a sequel. Good, I'll be sure to buy it.\n\n\n\nIf you're on linux and can't figure out why the game doesn't start without an error message, you need Adobe AIR. Their website is quite good on showing you how to get it running. A minor setback, I'm sure with licensing reasons Steam can't install it as a dependency. However, it almost made me assume the game was poorly ported and bugged (like Dead Island which doesn't boot on linux for some and nobody knows why, LOL). \n\nThe devs obviously cared a lot about this game: it's not junk meant to be sold to chumps where they buy it on sale, play for 15 minutes, then never open it up again. The writing is good -- not perfect, but meant to be (ugh) all ages. It's not a super deep story, though I feel with more practice they could pull it off if they feel it wouldn't detract from the gameplay in the sequel.\n\nI would advise the devs to look at their website and tone down on the humor -- had my bored, cynical ass seen it without playing the game I would've assumed this game would be shit. \n\nThe art isn't AAA title, but as an indie game, what the fuck do you expect? The battles are mid 90's SNES quality (though better than Breath of Fire II, worse than FF6) and the cutscenes are adobe flash-esque and very similar to the indie game Sequence (minus the voice acting, plus more character gestures).\n\nIf the game was a teensy little longer and made for the SNES, with a little more \"professionalism\" mixed in, it would've been a classic everyone would've known about. \n\nI came in expecting shit and found a gem I hadn't heard about before. I'm old, drunk, and cranky, and this stole an entire day from me and perhaps longer. Def buy @ $10, even $15.

Colpa perlopi\u00f9 del motore grafico (Flixel, una libreria per Flash pensata per giochi dal look retr\u00f2 e visivamente non troppo impegnativi), che non ha permesso al team condotto da Lars Doucet di esprimersi come avrebbero dovuto. Una lancia va spezzata in favore della colonna sonora, realizzata dal talentuoso musicista australiano Kevin Penkin, le cui melodie dal sapore epico quasi contrastano con l'aspetto altrimenti semplicistico di Defender's Quest.\n\nIl gioco si apre su uno scenario desolato: una giovane di nome Azra cade preda della pestilenza che sta decimando il Regno di Ash e, senza troppe cerimonie, viene scaraventata nel Fosso, un luogo remoto in cui quanti hanno contratto il morbo vengono abbandonati nel tentativo di arginare il contagio. Ci\u00f2 che la attende in questa necropoli a cielo aperto \u00e8 forse ancor peggio della morte, poich\u00e9 scoprir\u00e0 che al suo interno si aggirano dei pericolosi Revenant, vittime della piaga risorte ad una famelica non-vita e guidate dalle parole arcane di una misteriosa figura dorata. Ma non tutto il male viene per nuocere: Azra \u00e8 infatti la depositaria di un potere ancestrale che le permette di raggiungere il Mondo di Mezzo, una dimensione fra la vita e la morte in cui \u00e8 consentito vedere e interagire con l'essenza spirituale di ogni creatura. Grazie al fortuito incontro con Slak, un berserker vagabondo, la ragazza avr\u00e0 cos\u00ec modo di affrontare e sconfiggere i Revenant, tanto invincibili nel mondo reale quanto vulnerabili in quello spirituale. Sar\u00e0 dunque l'inizio di un lungo viaggio che porter\u00e0 l'improbabile coppia e gli altri sopravvissuti che incontreranno a scoprire la vera natura del Fosso, le origini dell'epidemia e un male millenario che minaccia di annientare ogni cosa.\n\nUna volta iniziata una battaglia, ritroveremo Azra in un punto predefinito della mappa sul quale convergeranno le unit\u00e0 nemiche, il cui scopo \u00e8 quello di raggiungere la povera medium e azzerare la sua barra di HP. Per difenderci, potremo selezionare diverse unit\u00e0 da schierare tramite mouse o scorciatoie via tastiera, utili anche per gestire gli incantesimi che apprenderemo nel corso del tempo. L'energia psichica, o PSI, della protagonista \u00e8 l'unico limite imposto al numero di personaggi e di stregonerie invocabili, ma ogni nemico ucciso ne rilascer\u00e0 un certo quantitativo che andr\u00e0 a rimpinguare le nostre scorte. Ci\u00f2 che balza subito agli occhi \u00e8 la notevole quantit\u00e0 di impostazioni strategiche con cui si possono configurare i difensori, anche dopo averli posizionati sulla mappa: oltre ad aumentare fino a cinque volte la potenza dei personaggi, \u00e8 anche possibile personalizzare le loro modalit\u00e0 di attacco, dal tipo di nemico sul quale concentrarsi al modo di utilizzo delle capacit\u00e0 speciali, a loro volta attivabili e disattivabili a piacere.\n\nAl termine del combattimento si aprir\u00e0 la schermata di riepilogo del gruppo di avventurieri, mediante la quale abbiamo l'opportunit\u00e0 di esaminare il loro livello, modificarne l'equipaggiamento e assegnare punti in una classica struttura progressiva ad albero. E' qui che le influenze RPG si fanno sentire con prepotenza: i personaggi infatti guadagnano esperienza, livelli e abilit\u00e0 alla stregua di un qualsiasi gioco di ruolo. Il level cap \u00e8 fissato a 60, insufficiente per massimizzare ogni singolo privilegio di classe, ma possiamo sempre redistribuire i punti previo un piccolo pagamento in denaro, oppure reclutare unit\u00e0 supplementari da evolvere in maniera differente. Il denaro o, meglio, gli scarti accumulati completando gli scontri (che rappresentano la valuta in vigore nel Fosso) serviranno anche per acquistare armi e armature pi\u00f9 efficaci.\n\nCiascuna mappa presenta quattro livelli di difficolt\u00e0, che forniscono ricompense in proporzione sempre maggiori, nonch\u00e9 stelle che valutano la nostra prestazione. Azra non pu\u00f2 impiegare alcun oggetto per difendersi da sola, ma ha invece la possibilit\u00e0 di sfruttare la potenza di alcuni tomi magici con effetti variabili, dal potenziamento degli incantesimi conosciuti ad una serie di penalit\u00e0 applicabili agli attaccanti. I libri si ottengono completando le sfide speciali, mappe particolari che vengono sbloccate soltanto dopo aver ottenuto un certo numero di stelle.\n\nMenzione speciale per la sceneggiatura e la caratterizzazione dei personaggi, con i toni spesso umoristici dei loro variopinti battibecchi che fanno da contraltare perfetto al pathos e alla drammaticit\u00e0 della prima. Alla Level Up Labs sanno perfettamente come scrivere un racconto e renderlo coinvolgente, lezione che molti degli sviluppatori pi\u00f9 blasonati dovrebbero prendere ad esempio.\n\nDunque, la promessa citata all'inizio \u00e8 stata mantenuta? La risposta non pu\u00f2 che essere affermativa e, se tutto ci\u00f2 non bastasse, dopo la conclusione delle peripezie di Azra \u00e8 presente anche una modalit\u00e0 New Game+, che include una moltitudine di subquest e di biforcazioni della storia principale, arricchita inoltre da un elemento supplementare: il diario della protagonista, sul quale vengono annotati molti approfondimenti legati all'ambientazione e alla mitologia del mondo, alcune brillanti considerazioni sui suoi compagni di viaggio... e brevi appunti degli stessi su di lei, che pare non riesca a nascondere il prezioso registro tanto bene quanto dovrebbe. Completano il tutto una nuova serie di sfide speciali e un mercante in grado di migliorare gli oggetti rari recuperati nella partita precedente.\n\nUnica nota negativa di un prodotto cos\u00ec ben confezionato \u00e8 il bisogno eccessivo di grinding per sviluppare al meglio i nostri eroi: sebbene l'avventura (sia base che New Game+) sia completabile seguendo la normale progressione della storia, i nemici dell'ultima fase di gioco sono semplicemente troppi e troppo forti ai livelli pi\u00f9 alti. E' vero, si tratta di un elemento extra che non inficia il valore del titolo in alcun modo, ma avrei gradito un maggiore bilanciamento della sfida piuttosto che una dilatazione esponenziale delle stat dei mostri, che dunque necessitano di unit\u00e0 altrettanto \"mostruose\" per essere sconfitti.\n\nComparto grafico a parte, Defender's Quest sale di diritto in cima alla classifica dei migliori tower defense in circolazione: accattivante, ben scritto e con una pletora di contenuti da scoprire, se amate il genere non riuscirete a staccarvene con facilit\u00e0.", "timestamp_created": 1414429154, "timestamp_updated": 1414443671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511401", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12656168": {"recommendationid": "12656168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064445036", "num_games_owned": 1280, "num_reviews": 160, "playtime_forever": 616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1387368045}, "language": "german", "review": "Story:         7/10 f\u00fcr ein Tower Defends Spiel \u00fcberraschend gut\nIdeen:         9/10 Final Fantasy trifft Tower Defends, Episch\nGrafik:        5/10 leider nur Standart\nGameplay:   5/10 Tower Defends Gamplay\nSpielspass:   9/10 Motiviert und fordert, hervorragend\n\nFazit: Defender\u2019s Quest Valley of the Forgotten ist eine echte Perle in der Mann sich \u00fcber Stunden verlieren kann, was f\u00fcr ein Tower Defends Spiel einzigartig ist.\n\nwww.tumblr.com/blog/thebenjaminkendrick", "timestamp_created": 1414418302, "timestamp_updated": 1414418302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511876", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12642126": {"recommendationid": "12642126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036798137", "num_games_owned": 1553, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1414167560}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub514\ud39c\uc2a4 \uac8c\uc784\uacfc RPG \uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uc870\ud654. \n\n\ud55c\uae00\ud328\uce58 \ub0b4\ub824\uac00\ub3c4 \ud560\ub9cc\ud558\uace0 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\n\ud074\ub9ac\uc5b4\ud558\uace0 +\ubaa8\ub4dc \uaf2d \ud574\ubcf4\uc138\uc694\n\nhttp://retro-like.blogspot.com/2014/10/game-review-defenders-quest-valley-of.html", "timestamp_created": 1414332538, "timestamp_updated": 1414332538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12635702": {"recommendationid": "12635702", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990268182", "num_games_owned": 941, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432960888}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub514\ud39c\ub529 \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac \uc9c4\ud589\uc774\ub098 \uc704\ud2b8\uc788\ub294 \ub300\uc0ac\ub4f1\uc774 \uc5b4\uc6b0\ub7ec\uc838 \uc790\uce6b \uc9c0\uaca8\uc6b8 \uc218 \uc788\ub294  \uac8c\uc784\ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ud65c\ub825\uc744 \uc8fc\ub294 \uc810\uc774 \ub9d8\uc5d0 \ub4dc\ub124\uc694.\n\ub610\ud55c \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ubcc4 \ubcf4\uc0c1\ub3c4 \ub3c4\uc804\uc695\uad6c\ub97c \uc790\uadf9\uc2dc\ucf1c \ubc18\ubcf5 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uac8c \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uc2ec\uc758\ud1b5\uacfc\ub85c \ud55c\uae00\ud654 \uac71\uc815\ub3c4 \uc0ac\ub77c\uc84c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1414296255, "timestamp_updated": 1456622084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12616740": {"recommendationid": "12616740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016162724", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492639326}, "language": "english", "review": "This classic Tower defence game is really great.

You go around with your ragtag bunch of misfit heroes, trying to save your skin and possibly the world. As you make your way, battle after battle, through hordes of zombies... I mean, Revenants, everyone's skills improve, making them harder, better, faster, stronger at slicing-and-dicing more undead meat.\n\nIs that all? No. DQ has a delicious old-school feel, partly thanks to the pixellated sprites, partly because of the great soundtrack which will make you think of the glorious days of SNES JRPGs. It also has some notably well-written dialogue, snappy and fun (though let's face it, the art in those scenes leaves something to be desired...). DQ also has lots of challenges for you. Playing levels at regular difficulty is getting too easy? No problem, you can replay them at Advanced or Extreme to get bonuses and goodies. Finished the game? No problem, there's a New Game+ with more difficulties awaiting for you. The learning curve is extremely well-balanced and I especially enjoyed being able to complete the main story without ever getting really stuck but with a very real sense of increased hardship towards the end (the last two-three battles, especially, I barely managed to power through).\n\nIt's definitely a very good game, especially if you like tower defense. Get it.\n\nEDIT: the developers released a \"DX\" patch for this game adding new content, remaking the engine with HaxeFlixel and redrawing the art to be better - thus the only complaint I could ever muster about this game has now gone.

No real challenge... or even tower defense.\n\nWhere most tower defense makes you think about how best to place towers and what to upgrade when, this game is completely stripped of thought. You learn the optimal locations for each \"tower\" type early on, and, as evidenced by \"hero mode\", the levels are almost all designed with a choke or two that takes full advantage of a single group's optimal patterns, so most levels play like this:\n\n1. Plug one, rarely two, \"tower\" groups into obvious optimal [strike]sockets[/strike] locations\n OPTIONAL: Spam archers\n2. Upgrade (Mostly whenever, you'll have plenty of 'power'.)\n3. WIN\n\nThe \"RPG\" side certainly gives math nerds something to obsess over, but it's similarly simplistic:\n\n1. Level up!\n2. Damage +1\n OPTIONAL: Reset points at any time, because you somehow screwed that up\n\nThat's it. You want your healers to heal, of course, (skip Holy Light completely) and to take advantage of each \"tower's\" secondary effects, (armor break, chill, bleed, range, light/blind, devour) but for the most part, you'll just have to decide which usually low-end skill or two to neglect. Usually the lowest. You can safely ignore most defensive skills. (The actual numbers are utterly pointless because adequate info to calculate DPS and some secondary interactions aren't provided, and you learn how effective everything is by \"feel\"/sight same as any TD game anyways... but don't tell the math nerds!)\n\nAnd that's the game for you. The art is bland, the story is absurd, but occaisionally amusing. Nothing to see here. While not a \"worst game ever\", if you're out for an actually good tower defense/game, look elsewhere. You might enjoy this if you're a math nerd, part of the Number Enlargement crowd, or just want something easy and amusing to click on and only plan to throw a few hours away with it anyways.

If you don't like the genre, I doubt any game would be able to change your mind, and suggest that you carry on.\n\nDefender's Quest managed to impress me by literally exceeding the average in every way I can think of.\n\n+ Not a rehash of another tower defense game - it didn't really do anything extraordinary within the genre, yet I can't think of a single game I'd call it similar to.\n+ Holy shit, the story is actually good, the characters fun, and the funny parts actually funny.\n+ There is no ultimate strategy that works for the game (build/upgrade order, etc). Each map forces a new strategy based on the availability of locations to place your characters, and enemy monster types.\n+ There are dozens of maps, with 4 different difficulty settings, all of which have a New Game+ version which play differently.

Shoddy writing? A beautiful \"skip\" button in every cutscene and dialogue can be turned off. Difficulty? If you hit a brick wall in story mode you can go back and do slightly harder versions of prior maps to level up. Tower diversity? Unique equipment means your second Berserker probably won't be as good as your first, so it's harder to spam one tower. The slog of New Game+ not going fast enough? Triple experience is an option in the menus. All this lets you focus on the core tower defense game, which is best played at 4X speed.\n\nPlenty of weaknesses can't be worked around, though. Workshop mods are few in number, and the first one I tried locked up the game in the first level. Character level is too huge a factor in whether you pass a level or not, meaning few maps feel appropriately scaled to your level at any given time. The game has a fixed resolution, even in fullscreen, and in fullscreen Steam notifications will leave artifacts on the screen. It's a little too easy to fall into a \"two of each\" mentality, setting up two identical sets of towers on the two major paths of most maps, with the only major variance between maps being what towers you level up first. The tower \"skill trees\" don't contribute much especially for those towers that only have variants of \"melee attack\" or \"shoot arrows\". \n\nFor all the weaknesses I've pointed out, there are few high points in the game.

I found it very enjoyable and satisfying to beat both the normal game and the new game plus (hard mode) first in \"hero\" mode where you only use the characters introduced in the main story line and then go back to recruit extra troops to tackle some of the more advanced extreme difficulties.  There is an interesting storyline to follow.  The dialog between the characters has a sometimes wacky sense of humor that I really enjoyed, while the overall storyline was still serious.  I thought they struck a nice balance.  While the game may look simplistic in graphic design, the experience is anything but and I got my money's worth many times over.

I liked it; overall, it's a quaint little game.  The characters are likable and the story (although not too original) is well paced and engaging enough.  There were a few times where the gameplay felt a little grindy to me (make sure you level up more than one priest, for example - I didn't and had to grind one up before I could proceed) but you can redo levels on harder difficulties for more experience and money or on easier difficulties to move the game along.\n\nEventually, I just started playing on easy to advance the story along, then I just quit playing altogether.  Although I didn't finish it I still liked the game and would recommend it to fans of TDs, especially if the added RPG elements interest you.  \n\nI also liked how it asked you to like the author on Facebook or something to get a free item at the beginning.  I always give games that ask me to do this a resounding, \"Hell No!\" and when I did with Defender's Quest it gave me the items anyway, so I thought that was nice.\n\nNothing to write home about, but it wasn't a bad attempt.

There are a lot of achievements in this game, and some of them are quite difficult to get. A single level can be solved in many different ways. And, the whole game can be played in newgame+ mode, which makes beating it a second time a new challenge.\n\nOnce I finished the plot, I found that I don't like to play for hours on end.

Also the generic characters you make have the potential to be clones of your main heroes, each class' talent tree provides customization but (at least at low levels) leaves little advantage to stray.

As an RPG Tower Defense hybrid, it's a blast. Solid mechanics that allow you to micro-manage as much (or as little) as you like, while offering simple tweaks to XP accumulation, allow for a high degree of accessibility. On top of that, the story is great. It does its own thing without relying too heavily on established fantasy tropes, and also mixes in some really successful humor - it actually reminds me a bit of Avatar: The Last Airbender.\n\nIf you're going to pick the game up, I'd highly recommend heading to the game's site. There's a sequel in development, which will have a score by no other than Nobuo Uematsu, and pre-ordering it there will net you a free copy of this game as well.\n\nBonus Note: For a more classic RPG experience, don't pick up any additional recruits in the towns you visit along the way. Instead, use only the characters you get directly through the story, and bump up experience gains to 300% - this will lend itself to a few special achievements, minimize micro-management headaches, and generally let you bask in the glory of your awesome, uber-powered characters.\n\nBonus Note+: The New Game+ is incredible, and so worth playing. It adds side quests, and a journal (which is actually really well written), giving loads of meat to the story and characters that was only hinted at on the first playthrough.

YES. Well, almost completely yes.\n\nI hate this genre with a passion. I enjoyed those first one or two tower defenses I've played, and I'm consistently disappointed with every successive iteration that there is basically no variation whatsoever, especially given how crowded the genre has been. I think it's to do with tower defenses being easy to make, in terms of design, programming, and graphics, so that a lamentably successful game can be made on a dime.\n\nHowever, I do have to give this one game a recommendation. As much as I dislike the genre, this one definitely feels fresher. It blends significant RPG elements into the usual formula. Firstly, it has an engaging story, with plenty of humour and quirky characters. The levels support the story, including the occasional boss fight. Your \"towers\" are in fact your party members, belonging to six classes, who gain experience from encounters and level up to gain additional skills, or hone their own skills further. This allows for plenty of variation amongst your party, although I found myself sticking to a single formula for each of my types.\n\nThe gameplay itself is not typical of tower defense. There's no placing your people so that they block enemies; they must be placed on the sidelines of a preset path. Also, there isn't an emphasis on placing more and more towers to increase the length of the gauntlet. Although you can place all 36 members of your party in a level, doing so is generally not recommended, because it is far more efficient to simply upgrade the party members you have. The end result is a far more sparse tower defense game, one that greatly favours tactical placement, and consequently, can be fun for the most jaded tower defense anti-fan.\n\nI also appreciated the difficulty system, whereby you can choose from three difficulty settings when playing each level (and a fourth that doesn't exactly count, for casual gamers). You can also come back and play the level on a higher difficulty setting, with different enemy types and levels, to get greater rewards (like unique items). It really added to the longevity of the game. Add in some challenges to complete, and you well and truly get your $15 worth.\n\nSo, for the first time, I have played a tower defense that has left me wanting more! I'm keeping an eye out on Defender's Quest 2, which is currently in development. If you too are as jaded as I am, don't instantly discount this one.

It doesn't hinge on playing a very abstract match 3 game. Its a hybrid of an adventuring party management game, and a battle based puzzler. \n\nThe fact that it sort of follows Tower Defense rules, in that you have waves of enemies, and they follow known paths, is all by the by. Goblin hordes usually follow dungeon tunnels anyway as they charge the brave adventurers!  I've played my fair share of Tower Defense games and hundreds of them bore me to tears, but this one seems to get the balance between RPG party management and planning, and the try it and then refine it mechanic. It's not overly complex, each class (and there are about six in total, I think) have skill trees that are only two branches. You need to earn money (loot and scrap) to purchase more adventurers to sign up. Then you have to train them up from level 1, and customise their skillsets to complement the team you already have.\n\nThere are beserkers who lend the chopping/slashing muscle - for corner killzones - and your archers can thin out the horde on the way, as well as try and catch the speedy monsters early. You also have (so far) Ice mages, for slowing effects and mages for healing or area of effect spells. You can specialise zerkers as damage soakers or fast dps dealers. You can specialise archers as heavy critical hitter, or speedy bleeders. Plus you've got the inventory to manage with different armours and weapons etc. \n\nSome of the harder levels later on in the story, require a little bit of farming to get enough money and people to do them. It just hit a sweet spot for me, in terms of low maintenance RPG adventuring, with just enough tweaking, twiddling and puzzling to keep me going back to it over and over again. Repeating the same levels with harder foes doesn't seem to get old, you have to adjust your tactics for a longer harder game. All the while you're crafting up a team whose skills work intimately with each other, making the sum of the parts greater than the individual.", "timestamp_created": 1403202711, "timestamp_updated": 1403202711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10526563": {"recommendationid": "10526563", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999203962", "num_games_owned": 3168, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 635, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465971537}, "language": "polish", "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJwqQ3n0Z_k", "timestamp_created": 1403188395, "timestamp_updated": 1403188395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507186", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10522345": {"recommendationid": "10522345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118844805", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404119103}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0417\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435,\u044d\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 Tower Defence,\u044d\u0442\u043e \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u0445\u0443\u0436\u0435.\n\u0415\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435,\u0447\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c,\u0442\u0430\u043a \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439.\u0421\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0430\u043c \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u044f \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u043b.\n\u0413\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0439:4/10.\n\u0421\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442:\u044d\u0442\u043e \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c,\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442,\u0445\u043e\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0438 \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439,\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u043b \u0441\u0443\u0442\u044c.\u041a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439-\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0432\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0443 \u043e\u0442 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432.\u0412\u043e\u0442 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0430.0/10.\n\u041d\u0435 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0442\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0433\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443,\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0441 \u0435\u0451 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439,\u0432\u0435\u0434\u044c \u044f \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0435\u0451 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0435,\u0438 \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c.", "timestamp_created": 1403157354, "timestamp_updated": 1403157354, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.213852", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10502797": {"recommendationid": "10502797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054192383", "num_games_owned": 503, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1382342044}, "language": "english", "review": "i like the visual novel style of this game great td.8/10", "timestamp_created": 1403006284, "timestamp_updated": 1403006284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10491460": {"recommendationid": "10491460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065641635", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442166169}, "language": "russian", "review": "Defender Queast: its cool Game", "timestamp_created": 1402914548, "timestamp_updated": 1402914548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10489197": {"recommendationid": "10489197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065379181", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 268, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403121259}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Como bien dice la descripci\u00f3n, es un juego de protege la torre con un poco de RPG.

One of the game types that has benefitted the most from the rise the indie market is the Tower Defense genre, and there are few games that exemplify the quality an indie title can reach like Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten.\n\nAt first glance Defender's Quest does little to inspire confidence in the overall product. With a rudimentary title screen and an almost complete lack of graphics options the game will seem lean on content to start with. Even the cinematics in the game are somewhat jarring and a let down, consisting of still images that, in all honesty, would feel more at home in a flash game than a title developed for sale.\n\nDelving deeper into the game, however, will quickly show you the quality that lies beneath this initially lackluster veneer. The in-game graphics are a wonderful modern take on the 16-bit era, colorful and with enough animation to keep battles fairly lively and interesting. While the graphics options are sparse at best, the game wows with how much customization it allows in its gameplay experience, allowing players the option to tune experience gains, character downtime penalties, and even monetary gains to suit most players from the most hard-core strategy gamers to those who are looking for a more relaxed experience. Despite the less than stellar presentation for cutscenes the characters themselves are all colorful and fun, and the art design itself only fails due to a lack of consistency between cinematics and gameplay. Characters offer a rudimentary RPG-style skill and level up tree, and combining that with the ability to level up characters mid-level to gain access to more advanced combat techniques gives the entire game a great deal of depth. The equipment system is underwhelming, with new swords and armor offering nothing in terms of rewards beyond an incremental stat boost, but the entire design shows a great deal of promise, if not polish.\n\nGameplay is often quick, but can be paused to allow the player time to consider strategy as often as one needs to. Overall the difficulty curve on the game is well managed: with rewards turned up the game is a relaxing affair that still manages to hold your attention, while turning them down increases the difficulty and need for strategy without ever becoming unfair. Controls with either the keyboard or mouse are generally responsive and convenient, and there is next to nothing in the experience that will frustrate most players unduly. Level design is well handled as well, with the levels scaling nicely to present new placement and enemy challenges as the player progresses through the game.\n\nWith an intriguing storyline, good characters, and incredibly scalable gameplay that allows it to appeal to audiences of varied skill or dedication, Defender's Quest succeeds in presenting its players with a high-quality product worth investing your time in. While visual presentation suffers due to a mish-mash of different styles, it is only a minor flaw in the face of an otherwise well-made and solid game.\n\nFinal Rating: 8 out of 10.\n\nDespite its visual shortcomings many game designers could learn a thing or two from Level Up Labs about accessible gameplay. By appealing to users seeking a hardcore strategy experience as well as those looking for a more casual game the creators have come up with a stand-out strategy title for both markets.", "timestamp_created": 1401323759, "timestamp_updated": 1401323759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10201270": {"recommendationid": "10201270", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004364547", "num_games_owned": 1221, "num_reviews": 149, "playtime_forever": 1177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471149874}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041c\u0438\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u0441\u043e \u0432\u043a\u0443\u0441\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0430\u043d\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441 \u0434\u0435\u0444\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0441.", "timestamp_created": 1400793206, "timestamp_updated": 1400793206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10185506": {"recommendationid": "10185506", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999689387", "num_games_owned": 2310, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1720, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1398667531}, "language": "french", "review": "L'un de mes coups de coeur de tous les temps !", "timestamp_created": 1400656005, "timestamp_updated": 1400656005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10182230": {"recommendationid": "10182230", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001346663", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466214985}, "language": "english", "review": "Oddly one of my favorite games that I continue to go back to.

This is where the writing really shines and is honestly probably the strongest part of the game.\n\nGameplay:  It's pretty standard tower defense.  Each class has skills, attack range, hit points, etc.  Set them up in likely positions and away you go.  Fail?  Try a different set up.  Characters also level up with experience for new skills, high attack, so forth.  Getting too easy? There's a Newgame+ with harder enemies and achievements that will test you.\n\nGraphics:  During gameplay it is high quality pixel art style, detailed and well done.  Cut scenes before and after battles are...I'm not sure what to call it.  Cell shaded stop motion?  It's nice and it does the trick without being flashy.\n\nLike I said, I just keep coming back for more, figured I might as well review it.

The window is so small it could very well fit on an 8\" tablet. This means playing for an extended period will likely hurt your eyes. I really wish I could make the game bigger without having to use fullscreen. The second complaint is the sound. It gets very bad when you have a healer and ice hero on the field.

The video trailer is pithy, suggesting that the game and its creators don't take themselves seriously, but don't be fooled. The story is simple but effective, not avoiding the cliches but embracing them and making them its own, but not with the wink and nod of the lampooner, but of a storyteller with an earnest wish to convey to you the world they've imagined.

The gameplay is tight, well-balanced, and clever.  Tower defense games are rarely this clever and the RPG system rewards good play.  The downfall of virtually all RPG systems is a sense of grind - you want the best stuff, you're going to have to perform repetitive tasks until you've got the prerequisite numbers.  Grinding reminds me of a job.  Defender's Quest lets you bypass that - anything you'd have to grind for is optional, and if you want the optional content, then you can toggle the exp and gold gain.  This also lets you set the difficulty to as difficult or as easy as you want.\n\nThe amazing thing is that the gameplay is so good, and the rest of the game is also so good.  The graphics aren't the modern blockbusters, but the character art is charming and clever, and the dialog is well-written and allows you to connect to the characters.  Fun gameplay, thoughtful gameplay, good art, good dialog, fun plot.  The game can even be replayed, and the new game+ has additional insight into the world if you're that hooked.  It also ramps up the difficulty if you like a challenge.  To top it off, the game is inexpensive.

There's even an option to increase game speed to make those usually slow lane defense games super fast, for either convenience or increased difficulty.

Using mysterious special powers (that excellently explain the tower defense gameplay) and the help of a band of ragtag adventures you'll pick up it is your job to guide her out of the pit. There is more at stake, and the plot has plenty of developments to keep you interested, but what surprised me the most were the story's pacing and its humour.\nNo story segment lasts more than a minute or two, excluding the ending but not the opening, yet it tells a cohesive and engaging story. You'll never feel like the levels are just there to pad out the story or vice versa.\n\n[b]Strategy & Replayability[/b]\nWithin levels you get to place your defenders along the paths your enemies will take to reach Azra. Doing so spends mana, so unless Azra has a lot of Mana (maximum mana increases by increasing her level) you'll need to consider which allies to summon. You can 'boost' these allies to unlock more attacks and increase their core stats, up to 5 times, this is equivalent to the traditional tower defense game's tower upgrade. Combine that with being able to place allies whenever you want, advanced targetting settings and certain allies working very well together while others negate some aspects of other powers (frozen vs. burning) and you have a deeply rewarding tactical system.\nIs this required to enjoy or finish the game? No.\n\nThe ability to play and replay any level you've cleared at any of 4 difficulties means that you set your own pace and your own challenge. On the lowest difficulty you can basically breeze through the game and just enjoy the story, never having to put a lot of thought into tactics or grinding, and the hardest difficulty will have you either rethinking your tactics or grinding a few more levels.\nClearing the game once, with any of its 5 endings (only 2 distinct ones really, one just has 4 different versions) will unlock new game+ mode parallel to the regular game mode. This features new powers for all enemies, several sidequests telling the story of one of the characters relevant to the plot, the ability to understand the 'ancient language' spoken in some of the dialogue and a 'journal' that offers lovely (and often hilarious) glances into the protagonist's mind as her journey progresses.\nIt will challenge you and reward you, and this is completely free extra content that was released months after the game was originally launched that is automatically included. I've put dozens of hours into this game and still revisit it regularly to see if I can't beat a few of the levels I still have problems with on a higher difficulty or to work on my Hero Mode run.\n\nSummary:\n+great plot\n+great tower defense gameplay\n+great RPG-style customization\n+replay levels\n+multiple difficulties\n+multiple endings\n+best way to do new game+\n-graphics are serviceable, but nothing to write home about\n-no voice acting (which to me is better than bad voice acting...)\n-Defender's Quest 2 isn't out yet, give it to meeeeee!", "timestamp_created": 1396450863, "timestamp_updated": 1396450863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641006", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9702777": {"recommendationid": "9702777", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964575577", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1401940062}, "language": "english", "review": "can't stand the cutscene art but the TD mechanics are great and there are options to make the game 3x less grindy", "timestamp_created": 1396430778, "timestamp_updated": 1396430778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502413", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9693942": {"recommendationid": "9693942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112087272", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481389946}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so much fun, a tower defense game with some rpg elements.

As a commander, you can recruit troops, equip them with weapons and armor and control their few skills when leveling up. It is pretty basic, yet very deep. The levels are single screen and grid based. You place your characters down and they automatically attack as enemies approach them. There are 6 classes, a basic melee, long range, healer, ice mage, slow defensive breaker and all powerful dragon with short and long range attacks. It costs PSI to place your characters, and more PSI to retract them (to move them).\n\nHow do you get PSI? Well you start with it, but then as you kill enemies, you gain more PSI and you have a maximum of course. You are defending a summoner against the waves of enemies and the summoner (your player character) can take a beating and has plenty of HP, so the game is forgiving, but rewarding if you make it through the level without being damaged.\n\nYou can 'boost' your characters at the cost of PSI. There are many levels of boos that enable skills that you've unlocked through leveling up your characters. When you level up your characters, you select their perk. Which has a simple perk tree of skills and passive abilities. It is a nice little system, but I find myself making the same perk choices instead of diversifying.\n\nOh and death is not perminant for your characters. If someone dies, just use PSI to bring them back. If your player character dies, you lose the level and need to restart. These levels are quick, especially at 4x speed, so nothing is really lost.\n\nWhile the game boasts a rich story.... I found myself hitting the skip button. I just don't play games for the story. You read the story as you unlock new levels and progress through a Mario World style map with all of the levels plotted as map points.\n\nThe game is very easy to pick up and play, but not just that, it encourages replaying the levels with 3 different difficulties (and a 'casual' difficulty as a 4th). If there's an insurmountable level.... replay old levels *cough* grind. But replaying old levels never seems like a chore, its more of a joy. Even if you keep replaying the same level on the same difficulty, every playthrough is different, since your characters level up and you can change your tactics.\n\nThe game is a lot of fun, and while its deep, its never overwhelmingly deep. There's not an overwhelming micro management either, even if you can micro manage everything.\n\nI highly recommend it. Its a fun little game, relaxing and never gets all that intense. I found myself playing it on 4x speed and that seems like it should be the average speed. Is it worth the $15?

However, there is plenty of incentive to come back and try it again for special items, experience and rewards. Battles are short and varied so there is not really a sense of grinding; indeed, it is interesting to come back with new options through skills and classes.\n\nThere is plenty of scope for strategy in the battles. There are six different classes, each having different skills and attributes which can be levelled up. They can be boosted during the battle, and can be recalled and replaced. \n\nThere can be incredibly tense moments late in a battle when a powerful enemy is closing in and you have to frantically recall fighters to put them into better positions. The ability to pause or slow time means that success depends on your strategy, not your reflexes. \n\nThe variety of battle maps and enemies make for a different experience in each battle. \n\nThere are genuine laugh-out-loud moments throughout the campaign, which adds to the pleasurable experience of progressing through it.\n\nThe New Game+ is the finest example of this mode that I've ever seen.

Instead of placing towers, you're placing party members. Like a traditional TD game, there are resource points you acquire within a round that you can spend on placing new towers (i.e. allies) or buffing the towers you've already placed. In Defender's Quest, this resource is called \"PSI\", which is essentially the \"mana\" of Azra (aka: you, the commander).  Howevever, Defender's Quest also gives you two other resources to spend BETWEEN rounds: gold and experience. \n\nExperience is used to unlock abilities on an ally's skill tree, thereby making them available to use in battle. (Each skill is assigned a power level and is not available in battle until you buff this ally to that level using PSI points.)\n\nGold is used to hire new allies into the party or to purchase armor/weapon upgrades for individual allies, which immediately and permanently boosts their stats (i.e. unlike skill upgrades, these are conferred immediately at the start of battle---no PSI points required.)\n\nEvery level can be replayed as many times as you want to farm XP and gold, and every level has multiple difficulty settings that earn you better gold/XP rewards for beating them. (There is no penalty for running away.) Beating the highest difficulty on some levels earns you a legendary weapon or armor, far more powerful than anything you'll find in shops.\n\nThe only bad thing I could possibly say about the game is that the art in the cutscenes makes the game's aesthetic somewhat comparable to something you'd find on a flash portal. By flash portal standards, the artwork is amazing. By overall industry standards, the art seems a little amateur. The in-game art is pixely and SNES-tastic. I criticize only the cutscene art here. But in the end, it doesn't even really matter, because the cutscenes have no effect on gameplay, and you can even skip over them all if you like. The game itself is A+.\n\nIf you like Tower Defense, it's one of the better TD games in the Steam catalogue.", "timestamp_created": 1394658503, "timestamp_updated": 1394658503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496057", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9415713": {"recommendationid": "9415713", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996298254", "num_games_owned": 521, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423008979}, "language": "english", "review": "Run.\nRun away while you can.\nGrab your precious time and run far, far away from this game.\nIt will consume you, and you will know RPG Tower-Defense bliss.", "timestamp_created": 1394501130, "timestamp_updated": 1394501130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9413233": {"recommendationid": "9413233", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038002905", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452847329}, "language": "english", "review": "My strategy boner masterrace fucking pc gaming tower defense with rpg elements so deep such story much strategy wow", "timestamp_created": 1394482514, "timestamp_updated": 1412283810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9410892": {"recommendationid": "9410892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006486844", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1381705367}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely worth it: If you like Tower Defense, Snarky Writing, and a bit of RPG stat management, this is the game for you.

Turns out that was a pretty damn sweet deal. Defender's Quest isn't overly complex, innovative, super-artistic or genre-defining. What it is, though, is easy to get into, sort of addicitve, and a lot of fun.\n\nHonestly, the core mechanics are pretty simple - you have six character classes, each with slight customizability (basically skill trees and pallete swapping consist of the variations in-class), and each serve their own purpose. The challenges definitely lend themselves to exploiting this variation - you WILL not beat this game using just your archers, for example. The key strategical elements will be where along the paths you place your characters, how you choose to boost them during battle, and how to time the protagonist's abilities (a feature which helps engage a player and prevents one from just sitting back and watching the level unfold). Add in a mild RPG-twist with how you choose to level up skill sets, and you have a very simple concept turned into something that has multiple layers of combat. Good move on their part.\n\nThe story, while simple, is sufficient enough to make you want to keep going. Characters are all pretty eccentric for the most part, and the humor is just average. I'm okay with that, though, as when I bought a game that looked like it could be run on a flash-based website, I really expected a cliche-ridden excuse plot with bland characters. Kudos to the creators on that front.\n\nThe real downside of the game comes in the form of some rather noticeable forced level-grinding. The advanced and extreme challenges often change the way you play a level, but the general root of how you play it is still going to be there. Most average players (see: me) will have to repeat a level one or two times before confidently progressing on to the next challenge. This is extremely obvious in the otherwise-enteretaining new game+ as the enemy traits mean you have to work waaaay harder to beat the level.\n\nOther than that though, this is a straight-forward game with a lot upside.

Cut scenes are minimalistic but very well done.\n\nI bought this game on sale without really knowing anything about it other than it looked cool and was really cheap yet I really wish I had bought it sooner.

In StarCraft, I'd spend more time stacking cannons than playing the ladder, and Team Fortress 2's MvM mode reveals a certain primal fun of killing tons of heartless, unfeeling dudes. To that end, Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten presents a well-rounded, core dude-killing experience, but the cracks in the polish are evident.\n\nYou're given six classes to play, all fairly standard for the genre: heavy damage, light damage, healer, ranged, status effects, and tank. Upgrade trees for each class are fleshed out for the game's length, and most powers are distinct from the moment you first receive them. Leveling up your characters before and during battle using \"Psi\" adds a certain urgency to the fight, and doesn't feel forced.\n\nBut between battles there exists some friction between the player and the imperfect interface. Between the fast-forward of battle and the clunky number-comparison engine to power up your party, you'll be wishing for a patch to streamline or automate the process. You could do worse but you could do better; not even trendy not-loading-but-loading-messages like 'reticulating splines' or 'powering up the thermal core' are to be seen. You might hope to find some solace in the story, but it's just as hacked-on as the interface and I couldn't be bothered to follow it.\n\nMy first playthrough entailed of spamming rangers (long-range) with the range upgrade and blew through the game without breaking a sweat, but in Hero Mode, where you limit yourself to one of each class, is where the game's difficulty felt most appropriate. Oftentimes you'll have three or four spawn points to deal with, and you'll need to consider the most optimal placement to cover all your bases, evoking the puzzle modes of yore.\n\nAll in all I'm giving this a weak recommendation. The game itself is pretty solid - gameplay is mostly balanced, and it can be as hard as you want it to be. The lore isn't engaging and you won't miss much from skipping it; on the other hand, if you're the type for a story maybe tower defense wasn't going to be your cup of tea anyway. If it goes on sale again for 90% off you'll get a fun one-off to pick up and play, not unlike something you'd find on a phone or tablet.

Le varie missioni sulla mappa potranno essere ripetute in un secondo momento anche a difficolt\u00e0 pi\u00f9 alte prolungando la longevit\u00e0 del gioco. Non mancano le modali\u00e0 Endeless e sfide bonus.\n\nL'unica pecca, secondo me, \u00e8 la grafica e il prezzo. La grafica \u00e8 un p\u00f2 in basso alle esigenze minime di oggi in un gioco a pagamento, che tra l'altro costa 14\u20ac. Ovviamente non infuisce affatto sul gameplay, ma non sarebbe sgradito un upgrade grafico, magari in un aggiornamento o in un possibile sequel, lo dico anche perch\u00e8 esistono dei Tower Defense in Flash gratuiti con grafica migliore.", "timestamp_created": 1392056820, "timestamp_updated": 1392056820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9042319": {"recommendationid": "9042319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024821938", "num_games_owned": 603, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513949735}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "This game is really awesome.

This game is simply awesome, it has everything a TD enthusiast could ever hope for. The game is quite challenging, which I consider a plus when playing TD games. I hate when TD games are overly simplistic and require very little strategy to win. Even when your characters are max level and you've obtained all the best gear it's still quite hard in the later stages of NG+.  Unit placement is extremely important as well as choosing the right skills/passives for your characters based on the level you're playing. On that note, the game has quite a few levels in the main storyline along which a bunch of bonus levels in the NG+ mode. The artwork is nice and the story is pretty decent. The characters are very likable and a bit comedic at times. I usually mute games and play my own music but I rarely did that with this game, the soundtrack is quite enjoyable. Overall I would give the game a solid 8/10. Looking forward to playing the second game when it's released. \n", "timestamp_created": 1391776841, "timestamp_updated": 1391776841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9004917": {"recommendationid": "9004917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017071068", "num_games_owned": 363, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468292209}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u982d\u3092\u3072\u306d\u3063\u3066\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3059\u308b\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\n\u30bf\u30ef\u30fc\u30c7\u30a3\u30d5\u30a7\u30f3\u30b9\u306bRPG\u8981\u7d20\u304c\u8ffd\u52a0\u3055\u308c\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\n\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3067\u624b\u306b\u5165\u308b\u7d4c\u9a13\u5024\u3068\u304a\u91d1\u3092\u4f7f\u3063\u3066\n\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u3092\u899a\u3048\u305f\u308a\u88c5\u5099\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u3066\u3001\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u5f37\u5316\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u9032\u3081\u308b\n\n\u6b63\u76f4\u914d\u7f6e\u306b\u60a9\u3080\u3088\u3046\u306a\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u306f1\u5ea6\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3057\u305f\u5f8c\u306e2\u5468\u76ee\u4ee5\u964d\u3067\n1\u5468\u76ee\u306a\u3089\u5f37\u5316\u3057\u305f\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u3092\u9069\u5f53\u306b\u914d\u7f6e\u3057\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3060\u3051\u3067\u6700\u9ad8\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u3082\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3067\u304d\u308b\n\u540c\u3058\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u4f55\u5ea6\u3082\u653b\u7565\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3051\u3069\u3001\u30aa\u30d7\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u7372\u5f97\u91cf\u3092\u6700\u59273\u500d\u306b\u3067\u304d\n\u5b9f\u7e3e\u89e3\u9664\u306b\u3082\u5f71\u97ff\u306a\u3055\u305d\u3046\u306a\u306e\u30673\u500d\u306b\u3057\u3066\u30b5\u30af\u30b5\u30af\u9032\u3081\u3089\u308c\u308b", "timestamp_created": 1391775413, "timestamp_updated": 1391775413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508938", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9003763": {"recommendationid": "9003763", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999650596", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1391729885}, "language": "english", "review": "Let's be honest: you will not be super impressed with the graphics and the game play is not going to astound you with its originality.\n\nNow that's out of the way I suggest you play it.

I find them repetitive, grindy, bland, and not innovative.\n\nBUT, Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is a true gem in the tower defense genre. It combines the elements of a tower defense game along with rpg elements, which gives the game a surprisingly fun twist. Instead of just placing troops that do not have meaning around, I was able to level up my characters and as I progressed I learned their stories.\n\nDefender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten is not only a tower defense game, it has a story, unlike many games of the same genre. The story was nothing special, but there was a story nonetheless.\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter (whore) like I am, then you'll be disappointed because a few of the achievements are a bit grindy. On the other hand, the developers were nice enough to allow you to go into the Options and increase exp and gold gain by 300%. I cannot stress enough how this option is amazing and that I think more devs should implement it, because of how grindy some achievements are. This also makes the game a little bit more on the easier side. I hardly ever lost a round. I can count on both hands how many times I've lost. \n\nThe game is very simple, I was able to beat the base game without generic recruits. I did recruit the generic characters in order to obtain all the gold stars/side quests. The UI is also very simple. Skill trees are simple.

Too many of them revolve around mechanics I consider boring, such as interest, and generally, they don\u2019t offer much beyond the core, basic gameplay expected from the genre. With that out of the way, I\u2019ll try to explain how Defender\u2019s Quest won me over.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible not to mention the fantastic writing present in the game: The story is overall serious, but the script makes no commitment to sounding mature or gritty. To the contrary: while some may argue the cast is composed of very standard archetypes, it\u2019s still highly varied, and the humorous exchanges between the characters are a joy to see. Ironically, it\u2019s their likability that makes the story much easier to care about, not presentation or \u201cvisceral\u201d experiences. Take notes, games industry.\n\nWhile I\u2019m at it, the soundtrack is also a very strong point, and is included in the game\u2019s folder for free. Plot and music are hardly all the game has to offer, though. As I said, I don\u2019t like TDs and what impresses me the most about Defender\u2019s Quest is how it carefully avoids annoying mechanics I\u2019ve come to associate with the genre.\n\nIn this game, you don\u2019t have to worry about insane resource management (interest) or fast finger movement (since you can pause mid-wave). It\u2019s only about character loadout and positioning. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy, but that it\u2019s the right kind of hard. That it offers depth.\n\nGoing through the game should take you about five hours, but that can increase tenfold if you try to finish all level variations and challenges. For me, it clocked at just over sixty hours, and was definitely worth its price.

As with any tower defense game, your goal is to prevent enemy units from reaching your tower. In this case, your tower is a librarian who has obtained magical powers to battle in the realm between life and death. To defend herself, she can cast some magic spells and she can pull her allies (berserkers, archers, healers, knights, ice mages, and dragons) into her realm and position them for defense. Besides the librarian, all units act on their own once placed. The defenders' skills and the librarian's spells can all be leveled up by earning experience. The skill trees, along with armor and weapons, provide the ability to customize each defender's strengths.\n\nWhat makes the game addictive is the variation. Each battle provides a different set of enemies and a different map with sometimes challenging unit placement options. As the game progresses, the type, number, and skill of available defenders increases which provides for different strategies to be employed. Each battle can also be completed at one of four difficulty levels, with higher levels producing different, more powerful, more numerous enemies. Completing battles perfectly (with no tower damage) unlocks bonus levels for additional variation. Once the main story is completed (10 - 20 hours depending on replays, bonus levels, etc.), a \"Play+\" option allows the story to be run again, this time with additional side quests, newly-enhanced enemies, upgraded weapons/armor, etc. The librarian's journal is also unlocked, adding some more humor to the game (which was already very light hearted in tone).", "timestamp_created": 1391437127, "timestamp_updated": 1391437127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8960728": {"recommendationid": "8960728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048432350", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1401941774}, "language": "english", "review": "When I first saw the screenshots I though it would be confusing and just plain hard.

Jeder Char kann individuell geskillt, eingef\u00e4rbt und ausger\u00fcstet werden. In jeder Mission kann ein Char maximal 4-mal upgedatet werden.\nJede Missionen ist in vier Schwierigkeitsgraden spielbar und das ganze Spiel kann sp\u00e4ter im Plusmodus nochmals durchgespielt werden, auch dann gibt es wieder 4 Schwierigkeitsgrade. Der Weg der Gegner kann nicht beeinflusst werden und man kann einzelne Wellen nicht zur\u00fcckspulen.\n\nDieses Spiel geh\u00f6rt zur oberen Spitzenklasse der Tower Defense Spiele, besonders stark ist es in den folgenden Bereichen:\n - Ausgefeilte Spielmechanik\n - Sehr gute Einstellungsm\u00f6glichkeiten f\u00fcr die Zieleprioit\u00e4ten der einzelnen T\u00fcrme\n - Gro\u00dfartige RPG-Einbindung und Geschichte f\u00fcr ein TD-Spiel\n - Gut balancierter und ansteigender Schwierigkeitsgrad der Karten\n - F\u00fcr jeden Schwierigkeitsgrad eigens zusammengestellte Gegnerwellen und Eintrittspunkte\n - Die Pr\u00e4senz der Entwickler im dazugeh\u00f6rigem Steam-Forum\n - Auch Monate nach Verkaufsstart wird sich um auftretende Probleme gek\u00fcmmert.\n\n[u]Fazit[/u]\nDie alte Version hatte mich trotz der einfachen Grafik gefesselt, wie kaum ein anderes Tower Defense Spiel.

Instead of using Towers you call forth allies to your astral plane (Current Map) to help defend yourself from Revenent's (The bad guys). \n\nThere are several different Allies to choose from and each ally can be specifically tailored for any given purpose. There is a suprising amount of depth involved in deciding where to place your unused talent points. Each character is Namable and has cosmetic customizable options. Naming a Character after yourself makes you want to use that character which is alot of fun to role play. If your into that sort of thing.The town's have places to recruit new allies and buy new weapon and armor. \n\nThe map plays out alot like Mario World or the equivalent and you can go back and beat older levels on harder diff's to get better gear and level. There is also a storyline written by some type of Wrinting/English major and the writing isn't too terrible. Some if it will give you a laugh and some will just make you scratch your head. But all in all this game is a lot of fun and is definitely worth the little money asked.\n\n-Casey", "timestamp_created": 1391207273, "timestamp_updated": 1391207273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500241", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8922059": {"recommendationid": "8922059", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040067018", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404795412}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like to play TD, you will definitely like this!

Por si esto fuera poco, cada clase tiene un arbol de habilidad que podemos recorrer como queramos, de forma que dos personajes de la misma clase pueden ser totalmente diferentes (podemos tener dos magos uno destinado a ralentizar enemigos y otro a hacer mucho da\u00f1o magico). Tambi\u00e9n podremos equiparlos con armas y armaduras que compraremos en los pueblos.\n\nLos gr\u00e1ficos y la historia no es nada del otro mundo, pero en este juego es lo de menos.

I've spent hours analyzing while playing this game. It all boils down to several pros/cons\n\n\n+ You can level up your units\n+ You can go back to the stage you've done to train\n+ Each stage has different level settings and rewards so you don't have to toggle difficulty\n+ Different combinations to try out\n+ Story is funny as much as it is serious\n+ Multiple Endings?\n\n- Story does get boring so I'm glad theres comedy in it\n- After awhile, you get tired of the grind\n- Story is short\n- Once you reach that point where you're no longer playing but \"working\" through the game. Typical for most rpgs\n- Limited content\n\n\nWith that said, I still recommend this game. It leaves you to wonder how much potential it has and hope the devs do a much better version next installment. It was enjoyable while it last. And don't let the price scare you. If you guys actually spent time learning how much time, effort and your own money is spent to develop the game... you wouldn't be b**ching and moaning about games being expensive.

Gerade die RPG Elemente steigern die Langzeitmotivation ins unerm\u00e4sslich. Hier ein besseres Schwert, da ein besserer Bogen oder vielleicht doch lieber einen Heiler oder Ritter mehr?\n\nDass die Tower hier durch Ritter, Magier, Bogensch\u00fctzen und anderen Figuren aus dem klassischen Rollenspielgenre entstammen, verleiht dem ganzen Spiel eine sch\u00f6ne Atmosph\u00e4re in die man gerne und vor allem immer wieder eintauchen m\u00f6chte. \n\nDie Musik untermalt die Kulisse und die K\u00e4mpfe sehr passend und wirkt an keiner Stelle im Spiel aufgesetzt oder nervt\u00f6tend. \n\nDer Schwierigkeitsgrad steigt angenehm, f\u00fchrt aber nicht zur totalen Unterforderung. Gerade zur Mitte des Spiels wird es sogar fast notwendig vorangegangene Level auf einem h\u00f6heren Schwierigkeits zu spielen, um bessere Waffen und neue Helden ordern zu k\u00f6nnen. Dies st\u00f6rt allerdings in keinster Weise den Spielfluss, sondern senkt lediglich die Frusttrationsgrenze.\n\nEin wirklich sch\u00f6nes Feature ist, dass die \"T\u00fcrme\" und die Heldin nach jedem Kampf, egal ob gewonnen oder verloren, XP erhalten und so im Laufe des Spiels weiter aufsteigen und neue F\u00e4higkeiten freischalten. Da ich bis zum Schluss nicht alle F\u00e4higkeiten erspielen konnte, bleibt die Langzeitmotivation auch nach dem ersten Durchspielen, immerhin 12 Stunden Spielzeit, weiter erhalten.\n\nEin klare Kaufempfehlung f\u00fcr alle die gerne Leveln und denen ein Funkeln in den Augen steht, wenn links und rechts die Feinde darnieder gehen.", "timestamp_created": 1390962579, "timestamp_updated": 1390962579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.673202", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8895318": {"recommendationid": "8895318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045477362", "num_games_owned": 387, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1390808792}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game, enjoyable mix of strategy/RPG/Tower defense.

It does however get a bit repetetive after a while and beating heroic difficulties requires playing maps over and over to level up your characters which I just didn't have the dedication to do.

Much to my delight, I was half-wrong. The plot might be your tried and true \"unlikely hero saves the world because, well, destiny\" fare, but the characters and the writing are frequently reminiscent of the humor that characterized the Penny Arcade: OTRSPOD games. \nOne notable feature of the game is that it does engage in some of the good, old-fashioned grinding that some RPGs are famous for, but this game lets you control just how \"grindy\" it is, giving you control of how much XP and scrap (money) that you receive at the end of each battle. This allows players to either keep the default settings and go through the basic plot, or to turn up the rewards to max so that they don't have to spend days grinding the same level over and over for XP so that they can run the special challenges. \nEach level has four settings ranging from Casual, where enemies have lessened HP and damage potential, to Extreme, where you better be ready because foes will WRECK an underpowered group. Playing extreme challenges unlock rewards for your party, giving you unique equipment and larger XP and scrap rewards, so there is a reason to tackle these challenges.\nA new game+ feature is a welcome sight, and the fact that this mode allows you to unlock upgrades for your unique gear gives you an incentive to play again. \nOverall, I found the game to be fun and engaging, well worth the price of admission.", "timestamp_created": 1390943648, "timestamp_updated": 1390943728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8892911": {"recommendationid": "8892911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076127515", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450792274}, "language": "english", "review": "Original retro styled fun, maybe slightly casual but still enjoyable.

But, it turns out that it's not your average build and kill game. For the first 4 hours I've been trying to finish up the story of the game. The story took me in and I just wanted to know how it all ends. If you are thinking about buying this game read on to see why you probably should. \n\nAfter playing 12 hours of the game I have finished the main story and went on to do some harder difficulties and other challenges. This game is fun in it's own unique way. Not only do you get an interesting story to follow, but also get stuck in character menu thinking how you should level up the skills for each fighter. \n\nThe only hotkey you will probably need to remember is \"space bar\" for pause. That is the only thing you will constantly hit to allow yourself some time to think before everything goes to hell. The game can be challenging even on the normal level. [i]( The level difficulties go as follows: Casual \u2013 Normal \u2013 Advanced \u2013 Extreme)[/i]. After your done with Normal, you can move on to a New Game+, which is way harder and more challenging. \n\nAnd yes, this is an RPG game. You will probably spend more time looking at the level up menu for characters rather than fighting monsters. It's not bad at all, but be prepared to think and compare different builds for the same class of fighter. There are 7 types of characters \u2013 Berserker, Ranger, Healer, Ice mage, Knight, Dragon and Librarian ( who is the thing that you actually need to protect).\n\nThe simple graphics was also done in a pretty good way. All characters are different and you can easily tell the difference. Everything looks the way it should in this kind of game. The only thing I noticed is that when the Ice mage casts his spells it can be quite hard to see the enemy and how much health they still have. On a positive note, the graphics look smooth overall and you won't feel like your playing the game from the 80's at the same time. To add to this I can also point out that the soundtrack is very good. It fits the theme of the game very nice and allows you to feel emotions from the battle field and from dialogues. \n\nI am yet not sure how many hours you can play until you finish everything, but I would guess it's quite a bit. I think this game will keep you from sleeping for at least a few hours after you should have gone to bed. \n\nI honestly think that this game is a must have product for not just RPG and TD lovers but also for average gamers.

Adding character growth and party management similar to something like Final Fantasy Tactics stop it from becoming stale like a lot of other tower defence games. The stat trees don't seem especially deep, but they're interesting enough in the early game and everything seems well balanced.\n\nThe story is simple but well told, the art style is also very simple (the 6th party member/character type in particular looks a little goofy) but the character of the game shines through it, and your party members are all expressive, interesting and actually quite charming. Lots of good, strong female characters here as well which is refreshing.\n\nEach level has an advanced and extreme version, which will require you to come back later when you're stronger. They're unnecessary to progress, but they will give you extra goodies if you go back and do them.\n\nCurrently on sale for $1.50, which is a steal, I'd consider it well worth it at the regular $15 for fans of good tower defence or tactics based RPGs.", "timestamp_created": 1390814762, "timestamp_updated": 1390814762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580553", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8866173": {"recommendationid": "8866173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085482286", "num_games_owned": 2118, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1392890047}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc2a4\ud300\uc5d0\uc11c 90% \uc138\uc77c\ub85c 1.49\uc5d0 \ub098\uc640\uc11c \ucc3e\uc544\ubcf4\ub2c8 \ud0c0\uc6cc\ub514\ud39c\uc2a4\ub958(TD\ub294 \uc544\uc8fc \uc9c8\ub824\uc11c..)\uc5d0 8\ube44\ud2b8\uc2dd\uc758 \uadf8\ub798\ud53d\uc774\ub77c \ub9dd\uc124\uc774\ub2e4 \uc0c0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uadf8\ub7f0\ub370 \uc774\uac70....\uae30\ub300\ub97c \uc548\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc11c \uadf8\ub7f0\uac00 \uc740\uadfc \uc7ac\ubc0c\ub124\uc694...^^\n\n\uadf8\ub798\ud53d\uc774 \uc804\ubd80\uac00 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c\ub294\uac78 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900 \uc778\ub514\uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uc5ed\uc791\uc784.\n", "timestamp_created": 1390812295, "timestamp_updated": 1390812295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8866172": {"recommendationid": "8866172", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965204694", "num_games_owned": 424, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470534741}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really fun game, and perfect for me as the father of a 5 month old as I can dip and out easily.

I usually compare tower defense and flash to something on Kongregate, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. Its a Tower-Defense RPG hybrid where your 'towers' level up as you progress through the maps. Each stage has extra difficulties to come back to for additional challenge and rewards through unique armor or weapons that you can give to your teammates. You can change the AI for targeting, which comes in handy during challenge stages and boss fights. When you're done with the game, you can also replay the game with New Game+ and unlock your previous team (while facing minions with new abilities, and unlocking unique item powers). The story isn't anything new, but the characters are engaging enough to let that slide.

If you're looking for a deeper challenge, you can replay earlier levels at a higher difficulty, or if you're feeling stuck or underpowered you have the option to go back a few levels until you're prepared to advance.\n\nThe actual game itself revolves around a band of characters replete with customizable appearances, skills, invetory, and a set base class that allows for a wide variety of playstyles and setups. The actual mechanics of the game are designed to allow you to either place your towers (units) down and work from there, or micromanage them for greater effect. As you progress you'll be unlocking spells to engage you further and allow for more in depth strategy.\n\nThat all being said, I find myself falling most in love with the games charming and quirky characters that really sell the rather contrived story. Through the course of the game you'll meet a wide variety of personalites that play off of each other with a dry sense of humor and extremely comedic results. They each feel consistant and defined, and it's always a pleasure to see how they interact when they're not dealing with the plot. Even the main character has witty dialogue and interplay with the party, making you feel legitimately connected to people who are essentially stationary sources of damage in the actual game.\n\nThe only point that could be held against it is the fact that the graphics and art style feel 'cheap'. The world map and actual gameplay is set in the old sprite style that we've all seen for the past few decades, and it makes the game feel dated. When you're watching the games cutscenes, you're stuck looking at a few stationary characters that look like the bastard combination of paper cutouts and Protector characters. It's nice that they took the time to set up full cutscenes and dialogue, but the graphics just aren't there.\n\nAs it stands, I'd say that this game is a real gem. On sale for 90% I'd say 'buy it' every time no matter who you are. If you find it on sale for anything over 25%, at least give it a good look, hopefully you'll like what you see.

A great game to have in windowed mode while doing other things, it's a pleasant distraction, very refreshing, and easy to learn. There is a ton of depth with characters having their own skill trees, each defensive unit becoming special in their own way. It has good areas to level up quickly if you want to power up, but it doesn't feel necessary. In fact, the game has a good pace, and you could pick it up and play just a few minutes, or a few hours! The ability to slow down, pause, or speed up combat is so pleasing to have also, allowing me to follow a flow I'm comfortable with, never too pressured, but always leaving you thinking.

It was more of a pain and tedious grinding than fun and epic adventure.\n\n\"Defender's Quest\" however kept me in my seat. It's basically an RPG mixed with tower defense, the best of both worlds if you ask me. I like everyone else play tower defense games because of it's gameplay, which is why this game is great. I took out the part that I hate in RPGs and replaced it with one of the most replayable gametypes that there is, which makes me wonder why no one have come up with this earlier. \n\nIt seems that alot of games are jumping on the \"Mix RPG with other genres\" train which really makes me happy to see. This game is great from what I've seen so far and great for anyone who have always wanted to get into RPGs but been scared of due to the grindy and difficult gameplay. I have played \"Final Fantasy XIII\" and didn't know what the heck I was doing 15 hours into the game, it felt like a fancy pokemon without the fun. I'm currently only 6 hours in and feel comfortable already, \n\nYes this game is hard and you will have to grind to get the best gear. However, each level has a difficulty setting like any mobile game, making it really easy if you want to speed through the story, still providing a challenge and bonuses for those willing to get them.\n\nI am currently only 6 hours in I cant wait to play more, I'm just hoping the game is as lengthy as an actual RPG, which if it isn't might be off putting. And it's worth noting that I only stopped played due to a game crash, it is the first time it has happened so I cannot say if it i a regular.\n\nEither way I do sincerely recommend this game, it is currently on sale, definitely worth it for the price tag, grab it now to save some cash.", "timestamp_created": 1390770172, "timestamp_updated": 1390770172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502472", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8861016": {"recommendationid": "8861016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029008599", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1391738160}, "language": "english", "review": "Like Fire Emblem, Tactics, and WC3 tower D put in a blender fullof awesomesauce!", "timestamp_created": 1390769495, "timestamp_updated": 1390769495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499985", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8860830": {"recommendationid": "8860830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116311076", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1409589597}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0439 tower defence. \u041d\u0435 \u0432\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0439 =)", "timestamp_created": 1390768491, "timestamp_updated": 1390768491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8860098": {"recommendationid": "8860098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053347381", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1397833370}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a surprising gem.\nAnd the writing is both interesting and laugh-out-loud hilarious, to be totally honest.\nI would pay the fifteen for this.\nI am however currently getting it for  $1.50.

This game is a whole lot of bang for the buck and I can't recommend it enough.\n\nIf you ever need proof that Flash Games can be worth paying for, take a look at this.\nWith so many TD games out there, it's hard to choose a good one. This is a good way to ease into the genre, with solid mechanics and just a sprinkling of plot and simple yet engaging characters. Mix in a little touch of RPG elements for upgrades and skill trees for your human \"Towers\" and here you are. There are many routes to victory, and challenging achievements to encourage you to try replaying with a different strategy.

a user agreement which is fairly common now days however unlike others I actually read it was very simple and easy to understand made a nice impression and told me about their attention to detail before even accessing the first screen of the game, this attention to detail was further proven once within the game the customization in just the options menu alone warrants this game being noticeable, I can't say if you will find it worth your money but if you have a few bucks burning a hole in your pocket or see this on sale (well worth full price in my opinion) grab it.\n\nThis game and its Developers are like a Unicorn in this day and age they clearly care about their players and the product itself Will be keeping a eye out for future releases from them.\n\nIf you have any

This was a fun game mechanic and it would pop up with different themes in different games through the years. But, it was not until Defender\u2019s Quest: Valley of the Forgotten that I found a game that used that mechanics to great effect in an Role Playing Game fashion.\n\nThe opening of the game shows you as the main character being dragged out of her house and thrown into the Pit. She has the plague but also realizes she has special powers.  From here it opens the ability to play the game.  She can bring warriors into the Half-Way Realm and allow them to kill the revenants, monsters people turn into after they die of the plague. The story starts taking twists from there as you follow what has really been happening to two kingdoms and what the ultimate goal is.\n\nThere are a host of characters that arrive in the game and each comes with their own personality.  The first people you find are barbarians, who wear no armor and are humorously suicidal in their combat tactics. Then you meet the rangers, who are far more practical about their need for survival. Each of the units you meet have a person who is going to be seen in cut scenes and helps give you a feel of the personality of that unit.\n\nEach of the units levels up, gains new skills, and can even be upgraded with new equipment.  Most of this is done in towns.  When in a town you can recruit units you have access to, but need to keep a close eye on the cost as the more units you have, the higher the price for the next one.  Gear comes in two main forms armor and weapons. There are also things that your main character can equip, but those mainly augment her abilities and are not purchasable.  When a character gains experience they level up just like you would expect in a normal RPG. Each unit has a skill tree with two branches. This means one barbarian might do a lot more damage and another might recover from wounds faster, it is up to you how you want them to work.\n\nThis game was not  anywhere on my radar and that is sad because it is a great game.  The units seem well thought out so as to be different and fit a certain use at a certain time. The story told through still frames is well done with attention to facial expressions and a great sense of humor.

Each character levels-up, learns skills, and equips gear individually, allowing the player to customize their battle experience and strategy. The overall game structure is similar to \"tactical\" RPG's, but with a real-time battle system. Game speed is adjustable, and commands can even be issued while the game is paused.\n\nIt also features an engaging, character-driven story written by an actual English major! The story strives to be fast-paced, snappy, and always relevant to gameplay.

If you haven't but like rpgs, this is your best bet to find out what a great TD can be like, with the RPG elements to help carry you along. Really, if the (very generous) demo to this game doesn't get you hooked, then tower defense may simply not be your genre, and at least now you know. ;)\n\n*** ***\n\nDefender's Quest is one of those games that without too much fanfare and fancy graphics simply get gameplay right. The rpg elements are well embedded, the story is not just an excuse for progression, the dialogues are well written and funny, the music is good and sets the mood nicely - but it's really all just about the balanced, fun, just-one-more-level gameplay.\n\nIt takes place in a plague colony, where the afflicted are turned into horrors controlled by a necromancer master villain. Your hero realizes she's capable of bringing herself and her allies into a halfway world, where the horrors and ultimately the villain can be fought with. While this is a simple enough premise, the way it brilliantly ties the story to the game's mechanics is one of the stellar design aspects of the game. (More on that [url=http://www.fortressofdoors.com/story-telling-as-problem-solving-defenders-quest-gdc-2013-narrative-summit/]here[/url], if you're interested in game design).\n\nDue to the fact that you customize the appearance of your pawns, equip them with weapons and armour, and train them towards permanent experience that you can put towards an interesting skill tree, you end up becoming more attached to them then if you just had \"towers\" to play with. Especially your set crew of 6 archetypical towers/heroes is a fun bunch with entertaining banter in the (skippable) cut scenes, and by the end of the game you are genuinely interested in their actions and story decisions.\n\nI appreciated the attention to detail that allows you to customize both the difficulty and the game experience: active pause, different speed controls, highly configurable hotkeys, customizable general difficulty on top of the ability to replay maps on different difficulty levels (which actually play differently, instead of simply increasing the number of enemies or turning them into sponges). And then there's the Game+, which may just be even more fun to play than the normal game - if you can survive it. Plus, there's the sheep. Good luck with that. ;)\n\nWith its 30+ grindable main levels, the endless levels, a couple of different endings, a Game+, side missions to unlock and many interesting achievements, there is a very generous amount of content there for the price. Plus, a full HD/60 FPS upgrade is coming soon, for free, with redesigned graphics (the one aspect of the game that many may find lacking), so what more do you want?\n\nMaybe what you want is Defender's Quest 2, which is expected to come out some time in 2016 - giving you plenty of time to finish playing 1 first. :)", "timestamp_created": 1390687732, "timestamp_updated": 1463515162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557064", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8847829": {"recommendationid": "8847829", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015788962", "num_games_owned": 2409, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466131825}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the few tower defense game I would play multiple times and still very much enjoy it.

What's more, it never loses its intuitive and elegant design as it becomes more mechanically complex, and the game does a fine job of presenting you with a tough challenge but essentially giving you all the tools you need to overcome said challenge. Success is not determined simply by grinding to level up your characters, but rather by finding a way to better manage your resources until you find the optimal way to succeed.\n\nThis was one of my sleeper hits from 2013, and it's one of my favourite tower defence games on Steam, up there with Defence Grid: The Awakening and Plants vs. Zombies. It's a great starter tower defence game and introduces less experienced players to its mechanics in a very manageable way, but it also provides the depth and strategy that you just won't get from most of the free flash-based TD games you can find online. It's a fresh take on the genre and its very well executed...just don't expect to be too engaged by the cutscenes and character interactions that break up the combat missions. They're occasionally funny, but often rote and unnecessarily long.

Quite like when you were presented with the task of making up a story and including certain words or characters, only Level Up Labs made a game out of that. The benefit is mostly avoiding pitfalls growing out of weird game mechanics. IMHO, while the story did not blow my mind it is still very fine and the result works quite well.\n\nSo, like any tower defense, you defend a place from creeps that have different stats and abilities by placing \"towers\". In this they're game characters who have their own class and the associated, developable skills, i.e. attacks, buffs and debuffs. Azra summons them up and places them into the labyrinth in suitable locations. Every character is useful and has their role: to spell it out no one works as an instakill device against everything. The enemies always follow shortest path towards Azra, so you can plan accordingly even when some enemies can swim. Finally, if the troops fail, you can beat the horde back with spells. Everything uses kills for money.\n\nOn the world map, you move along a linear path that sometimes diverges for sidequests. Every space is either a level with attacking waves of enemies or a town where you can buy weapons and armor and recruit troops. Story advances in every space so you're never bored unless getting stuck in a difficult level. That does not happen often, for the easy levels are really easy and you can even go to casual difficulty and/or set experience and money gain to 3x normal for faster leveling up without any penalty. You do get better rewards for higher difficulties, and to master a level it has to be beaten on extreme: this always rewards you with a special item granting the incentive for beating them all, if the associated achievement won't do it alone. You can also return to beat the levels again after you've grown in strength.\n\nWhen the levels run out, there are several \"challenge\" levels to beat, two of which are of endless type with ever-so stronger incoming waves. After beating the game you can also give it another go with NG+ that is more difficult with monsters getting additional special abilities. NG+ also adds several additional sidequests and its own version of the challenges.\n\nWhile the flash graphics aren't eye candy, the music is engaging and the residing mechanics will let you enjoy the game for several tens of hours. However, trying to beat every level perfectly can become tedious, for the levels get tougher and tougher as you advance. Typing this, I've yet to beat the last few levels on extreme. Still, I would heartily recommend the game for tower defense fans: I sure got a blast with it. I especially recommend going for the Hero Mode+ challenge (and to lesser extent the Hero Mode++).", "timestamp_created": 1388188938, "timestamp_updated": 1388188938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528639", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8301712": {"recommendationid": "8301712", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977325824", "num_games_owned": 515, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1374518773}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Muy adictivo, he estado totalmente engachado a este juego.\n\nDemostraci\u00f3n de que lo importante es la mec\u00e1nica de juego y no los gr\u00e1ficos, aunque est\u00e1 claro que el juego est\u00e1 enfocado as\u00ed a prop\u00f3sito, y de hecho los gr\u00e1ficos son muy chulos y llevan ilustraciones de por medio.\n\nMuy recomendado y a buen precio! ;)", "timestamp_created": 1388068206, "timestamp_updated": 1388068206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8268561": {"recommendationid": "8268561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024198707", "num_games_owned": 460, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465968393}, "language": "koreana", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1387953919, "timestamp_updated": 1387953919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8261429": {"recommendationid": "8261429", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971141457", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1388849749}, "language": "english", "review": "Great little TD", "timestamp_created": 1387922998, "timestamp_updated": 1387922998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499985", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8243518": {"recommendationid": "8243518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031075431", "num_games_owned": 425, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 1522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1388030104}, "language": "english", "review": "Thanks Ray for gifting me this game.

That and the RPG mechanics give an attachment to your characters (who act as the \"towers\"), and a sense of progression, that make this game so much more than most tower defense games.

It really left me just wanting more of it (which made me squee when I heard there making a DQ2)\n\nBut at $15 us it would have been worth every penny, let alone the $5 I got it for.

However, that would be doing the game and the developers a real disservice.\n\nGranted, the 16-bit style is one you're either going to like or not, but it is executed very well indeed, as the use of colour is very done so that it remains pleasing on the eye and never jarring. The execution and balance of the game overall is very polished, and belies the developers' size - it really appears to be well-tested and difficulty is a very smooth and progressive curve. \n\nPacing is similarly excellent, and it definitely evokes that magic \"just one more go\" response. The icing on the cake is the story, which is nice and humorous without being too cheesy or vulgar, so it greatly appeals to a wide audience. As comedy is a very difficult thing to write, they have done a fantastic job here; it's very tongue-in-cheek, and it fits the game perfectly.\n\nThe meat of the game lies in having characters as your \"towers\" to place on a map. You can purchase extra characters to a maximum of 6 of each, and level them individually.

That in and of itself would make an interesting game, but the designers saw fit to include an interesting story to explain away the game mechanics as part of the plot. While the central theme of plague and the risen dead is dark, the dialogue between characters is lighthearted and oftentimes funny. Such a combination of serious undertones and bright interplay amongst the characters helped me enjoy the game quite a bit.\n\nInsofar as the actual mechanics are concerned, this is not a \"maze building\" tower defense game. The enemies will come in waves along pre-defined paths with limited placement for your defenders (the towers, essentially) available. Defenders can be upgraded by \"boosting\" them through five levels which unlocks any abilities they may have earned through levelling and a rudimentary talent system. Speaking of levelling, this is where the rpg mechanic comes into play; every level gained by a defender gives you talent points which you can use to tweak the character and gain new abilities. While the talent system is very basic, it does give you a feeling of satisfaction to distribute your points when a defender levels or you gain access to a new class. \n\nWhile there are only six classes of defender to use in the game, the customization inherent in the rpg progression system means there is the possibility of some differentiation. Additional defenders can be recruited in towns across the game's story map, wherein the plot is advanced and new battlefields are opened up. In battle, these defenders are placed with the same resource you use for upgrading, but recruiting new defenders gets progressively expensive with the game's story mode currency (won through battle). That same currency is used for equipping your defenders with weapons and armor, so there is an opportunity cost. As additional currency can be won by going back and fighting harder versions of prior story mode battles at any time, you never truly feel strapped for cash.\n\nAs the game is 2d, the question isn't whether the graphics are advanced, but how good and cohesive they look. Cut scenes to advance the plot are drawn with a style which gels extremely well with the battle sprites and look pleasing to the eye. Opinions on art styles will vary, but the cleanliness and cohesiveness of the game's visuals can not be denied. There are no sloppy looking sprites in this game and your defender's colors can even be customized to a limited degree to further suit your tastes. \n\nUnfortunately, while the animations of your defenders (and especially that of a certain antagonist at the very end of the game) are fluid and pleasing to watch, the animations of the monsters which you are tasked to kill are very basic and stilted. Still, most of the time said monsters are drowning in a sea of pleasing damage numbers as your defenders are chopping them to pieces, so perhaps some gamers will be able to overlook this as I did.\n\nAccording to steam, I was able to extract 13 hours out of this game and there are still bonus challenges to complete and a new game plus mode to experiment with. Whether that is worth the price of admission is a decision that I encourage you to weigh carefully if you would normally pass up a game based on length: it is lovingly crafted and an enjoyable experience that I can recommend to any rpg fan, even those who aren't familliar with tower defense games.\n\nThe long and short of it: 8/10, buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1385566400, "timestamp_updated": 1385566400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7783644": {"recommendationid": "7783644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039630868", "num_games_owned": 1210, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1387021240}, "language": "english", "review": "Never thought RPG and Tower defence genre could have a great cross-bred like this!\n\nLike any other TD games out there, your main mission is prevent any enimies from reaching the party leader standing at the end of the road.

Where Defense Grid's strength is the perfect distillation of the tower-defense formula, Defender's Quest remains toe-to-toe with it because of how it radically adapts the basic idea of tower-defense -- deploying stationary defenses along a path or series of paths -- to work with a highly original fantasy setting and a set of solid RPG-like mechanics. The presentation, while not sophisticated, is incredibly appealing, and the writing is nothing short of superb.  It's also endlessly replayable, and the New Game + mode actually gives you a reason to do so.\n\nHighly recommended to everyone, tower-defense fans and non-fans alike.

I like RPGs, it\u2019s reassuring to know you can grind and level up to make up for your lack of skill and intelligence.\nThe game offers 25 stages plus bonus levels that are all replayable (didn\u2019t realize that\u2019s not a real word) at not just different difficulties but also with a different mix of enemies.  There are only six characters (towers) but each has 10 or so skills which adds to the variety.  There are 19 enemies including repallets (figured that wasn\u2019t a real word) and five bosses.\nThe best part is the characters.  The dialogue and interaction is engrossing often hilarious.

For starters, rather than building soulless towers that you have zero attachment to, you employ RPG style characters to defend your \"Librarian.\" These characters can be named, stylized (to a slight degree with color options) and then leveled the more they're used. They each even have a system of perks that can be unlocked through the course of the campaign. You can employ as many as you can find the dosh for, but each requires \"mana\" to be deployed in battle. This is a finite pool that is replenished by killing baddies. The maximum mana you can have increases as your librarian levels as well, so in essence it is a clever way of keeping the player from throwing 70 towers up at the start of a new mission and steam rolling. \n\nThe game also has a pretty humorous story line, and memorable main characters. There's unique items you can unlock for your favorite minions, and even a brutally hard Game+ mode if you desire even more once you finish the campaign.

Your towers are characters you gain as you progress in the story, or purchase at various points. Your team protects your summoner, and both the characters and summoner, gain XP after each battle (win or lose, although that can be adjusted). If the game becomes too hard, you can replay an earlier level for extra XP / scrap (the game's currency). However, replaying levels is not grindy-feeling, since each level can be played at three different difficulty levels, which is a different than just the same monsters with more HP (for example, sometimes there are additional spawn points and sometimes the monsters have additional bonuses). (And if you really don't like redoing levels for XP and scrap, you can increase the gain of each of them.)\n\nUnlike some TD games, there is no pathing manipulation: the squares the characters can be placed on are different than the creeps' travel squares. That doesn't mean that character placement is permanent: it is sometimes useful to remove and re-place characters (especially in boss levels or the bonus levels available during the second playthrough).\n\nSpeaking of the second playthrough, that isn't just the same monsters, but more HP. Usually the second playthrough monsters have additional abilities, such as attacking your characters as they walk by, or become temporarily immune to non-area damage. The second playthrough also allows purchase or unlock of the best weaponry. Another nice touch is that switching between the first and second playthrough is just a matter of returning to the menu; your entire party and loot remains the same. (I worked a bit on the second playthrough, got stuck, went back to the first playthrough to do some of the harder difficulties of the levels, got stuck, went back to the second playthrough, et cetera.)\n\nBesides your party characters, the summoner has a few spells that unlock while progressing through the story and can be increased as the summoner's level increases. These spells can help out during tight spots in earlier levels, and are pretty much required for the hardest levels.\n\nSlak says to at least try the demo; pants are optional.", "timestamp_created": 1373840221, "timestamp_updated": 1480391921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "787330": {"recommendationid": "787330", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978346635", "num_games_owned": 571, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468544733}, "language": "english", "review": "I am seriously impressed by this game!!

The game itself doesn't give you much freedom of movement in general, you just kind of advance to one point of the story to the next, but that didn't actually bother me, surprisingly. \n\nOne of the nicest aspects of the game is the option of giving every single one of the characters your group gets a name of your choice. There's always some dialog, main char asking \"What's your name?\" and you get a prompt asking you for a name, which is then used throughout the rest of the game (and can be changed if desired).\n\nThe game puts you in the shoes of \"The Librarian\" (her name will be asked for first) who has the unique ability to summon her allies (regular fighters, archers mages and the like) into a \"spirit realm\" where the undead, which make up the bulk of the enemies encountered in the game, can be actually made re-dead for good.\nTherefore she's the one who needs to be tower-defended. The army of defenders consists of six different classes of units which can become six of each type (additional characters can just be recruited in towns for ingame scrap). They all level up and have skill that can be improved by the player with each levelup.\n\nThe dialogues and the general story is actually quite good and really really funny, all the characters are quite sympathetic and just lovely insane.\nAlso, the game has a neat turn when it comes to playing it a second time (new game+) because the second playthrough mode actually adds several new sidequest, an upgrade option for the unique weapons found during the first playthrough and a simply hilarious journal, which recieves entries every now and then as the journey progresses... extremely funny =D.\n\nEven though the game seems to be a finished release, I gather there's still people working on it, so it might even get additional content updates.\n\n\nDefinitely recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1372787289, "timestamp_updated": 1372787289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "5670509": {"recommendationid": "5670509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053843545", "num_games_owned": 569, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1811, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1373112625}, "language": "english", "review": "A highly addictive TD game with some RPG elements.

Also going by the comments in the games forums which is what piqued my curiosity at this title in the first place.\n\nVery happy i bought it on sale but after playing it id of happily considered buying it while it was @ normal prices.

But she doesn't. For unknown reason, she returns from the halfway to the hell. In return, the terrible experience on the verge of life and death gives her a new spiritual ability, making her capable of leading people to fight against the undead.

I'll try to explain why I love it so much, and why I'm so excited for the sequel that was recently announced.\n\nMechanics\n\nThis game provides somewhat traditional mechanics if you're familiar with TD games. Players can build units on the perimeter of the path only, so there is no blocking/routing mechanics to worry about. Unit's have different attack types that are better and worse for some situations\nWhat is unique about this game is that units level up in a persistent manner between levels, allowing your units to grow over time, This included an entire skill tree for each class of units that can be customized to your play style. Additionally, units have a weapon and armor equipment slot and the game does a good job of making this meaningful by introducing rare equipment a bit later in the game.\nLevels are replayable so you can grind your team a bit if you feel a little weak or would like to beef up a bit before a boss level. To compliment this aspect of the game, each level can be played on different difficulty levels, which provide bigger rewards at the cost of a higher difficulty. This aspect of the game kept me going back and trying to beat my records and old levels in order to get some of the better rare gear.\nLastly, the game features a fast forward mode which is a welcome sight for those who play a lot of tower defense games. It really helps grinding out those later levels.\n\nStory\n\nIt's rare for a TD game to have an in-depth story, but Defender's Quest does a great job with this. It's not ground breaking, but it certainly sets a nice tone and even introduces a bit of moral dilemma that plays into the unit mechanics later in the game. I won't spoil it, but I will say that the level of narrative impressed me, and kept me engaged until the end.\n\nGraphics/Sounds\n\nAll standard stuff here. You can look at the screenshots and get an idea of what you're into. In general I'd say that the graphics do a good job of matching the needs of the gameplay, and the animations are smooth and crisp even during hectic late game levels. The graphics change into a pleasant style during story segments and do a good job of relaying the emotion and facial expressions of the characters.\n\nSummary\n\nAll in all, this game really scratched a Tower Defense/RPG itch that I'd been craving for a long time. If you can pick the game up on sale and like TD games I'd recommend buying it without hesitation.", "timestamp_created": 1372463110, "timestamp_updated": 1385408519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.707941", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "297867": {"recommendationid": "297867", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967992446", "num_games_owned": 847, "num_reviews": 508, "playtime_forever": 670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1372855244}, "language": "english", "review": "You know, just when I compared the genre of tower defense to a 90's boy band and most aspects of Final Fantasy as tedious wank, there comes a game that I probably would be beaming hate rays at.

When I read tower defence rpg I was a little lost. I have never heard of the two being combined and wondered how it could be done. \n\nThe rpg side of this game is based around the story of Azra; Azra is a royal librarian who found herself in the forgotten zone - a plague ridden part of the kingdom and things went crazy. Along the way Azra met people to aid her in her journy to find out what is going on. People like Slak and khetti (names can be changed I kept them default though). the players met along your journy become your towers and placed in a standard tower defence way, slak for example is a berserker who slashes and slaughters light hp targets, and khetti is an archer. The characters are leveld up over time so the player can equip them with gear and put points into skills such as slaks flurry to hit 5 targets at once. \n\nNow back to Azra; since the game revolves around her what role does this librarian play. Well in combat you are summoned to the spirit world to kill the plague ridden posessed citizens. Azra levels up with your characters so she can cast damage spells, buffs, and heals to your people during combat. The heal is very advantagous because your people will die. . . HOWEVER they can be resummoned. To prevent deaths one of the options is to equip them with armor which can be purchased and unlocked at certain points in the game along with other mercenaries.\n\noverall I rate this game 5/5  due to the 5 dollar sale price during steam weekly sale and the unique story and combat. The game also supports the steam workshop so that you can continue the game with player made levels which I have not tried yet.\n\nFor the cons of this game I have not found any but some players might be turned off by the non applicable voice acting, all of the narrating is texted out.", "timestamp_created": 1372368215, "timestamp_updated": 1372368215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "4043863": {"recommendationid": "4043863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031225726", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 3759, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1377689254}, "language": "english", "review": "A nice mix about:\n+\"Final Fantasy\"\n+\"Plants vs Zombies\"\n+\"Fish vs Crab\" or \"Go home dinosaurs\" [Tower Defense]\n+Mann vs Machine (upgrates) from the game \"Team Fortress 2\"\n\nPS: Trailer-bad, Screen shots-bad; BUT demo awesome and big.", "timestamp_created": 1372366754, "timestamp_updated": 1385646297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485963", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "910400": {"recommendationid": "910400", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981754850", "num_games_owned": 1225, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1372361481}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome , Awesome to the max .", "timestamp_created": 1372365328, "timestamp_updated": 1372365328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "731645": {"recommendationid": "731645", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976827634", "num_games_owned": 375, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 1119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481636332}, "language": "english", "review": "I love Tower Defender games and I love RPGs. \"Defender's Quest\" does a beautiful job of combining the two into a epic game!

Titles that have been released five years ago and receive an official \u201cmakeover\u201d, even less so. Yet Defender's Quest Valley of the Forgotten (DX edition) stands as testament that you don\u2019t always have to rely on modders, in order to refresh the looks and feel of a video game that has stood out since its initial release date. True, not many devs take such matters into their own hands, yet the exception sets the rule. We should never reach a point at which we can relax and be satisfied simply with what we achieved so far. There's plenty more to see and do, on the horizon.\n\nIt is Level Up Labs\u2019 Steam debut but this developer has wisely opted for improving their first and so far only project, rather than churning out more titles in the meantime. So Defender's Quest Valley of the Forgotten was a 2012 release until the Deluxe Edition of 2016. The past year and a half has been spent by the dev team, patching things up, so I would have really nominated this game as a \u201clabour of love\u201d, if only I knew of its existence sooner. Curator Connect has remedied that issue though. Onwards with the review!\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nI wasn\u2019t a notable fan of tower defense titles since it\u2019s usually the least developed strategic subgenre of them all. As in, less story and far more action. At times, without even the slightest hint of an exposition. But not Defender\u2019s Quest, obviously. Even before its graphic overhaul, this game already had an excellent and surprisingly original storyline which details the adventures and struggle for survival of a gifted young mage/medium and her increasingly larger party of warriors and mystical creatures. Of course there are dragons. What self-respecting fantasy setting could do without them? I'm geniunely pleased by this decision, it's not sarcasm. Just check my avatar.\n\nYes, we have a female protagonist whose background has been set in stone, yet her name is a choice left entirely to the players themselves. A lot of customization is involved in Defender's Quest Valley of the Forgotten and that is a vast part of its appeal. You wouldn\u2019t expect much if any, replay value or character development from your run-of-the-mill indie tower defense. I shall discuss in general terms about the story while avoiding any spoilers, naturally. Also, I will refer to the default character names, since I didn\u2019t feel like renaming anyone just yet. \n\nThe game\u2019s protagonist is Azra, a former royal librarian of the Ash Kingdom. This is a high fantasy realm in which magic and supernatural monsters are a common sight. Azra gets stricken with the Revenant Plague, a terrible disease which not only kills most of its victims, but it also resurrects them, thus increasing the hordes of seemingly mindless undead. These zombies and slug-like creatures are susceptible to necromantic control, so there are more than a few sorcerers who can manipulate the Revenant to their own twisted will. \n\nThe Ash Kingdom created a massive containment area in which all the citizens showing signs of the plague, are thrown in. Abandoned, by a state which obviously has no intention of caring for the sick or finding a cure. The Pit doesn\u2019t kill all those plague bearers though. Azra found new strength in her sickness, reinforcing the adage of \u201cwhat doesn\u2019t kill you, makes you stronger\u201d. I refer to our heroine as a cross between a  mage and a medium, precisely because she can manipulate the ethereal and material realms in equal measure. \n\nThe Half-Way World is the spiritual plane on which the previously invulnerable Revenant hordes can be fought and defeated. Azra possesses such powers that she became the keystone to this encompassing battle which can finally bring back the kingdom to sanity and prosperity. As a direct result of her actions, she is an asset to both do-gooders and the antagonistic necromancers who wish to exert further control over the undead. The protagonist shall not be alone, for she\u2019s a natural leader as well. \n\nHeroes and commoners alike, shall join her fight to escape and subsequently destroy the Pit, by removing the necessity for containment in the first place. Being a story-driven experience, between battles, there will be a lot of cutscenes and interaction between all involved characters. There is plenty of room for humor as well, despite the gloomy themes present in Defender's Quest. A journal keeps track of Azra\u2019s thoughts, fears and it also serves as a compendium for the title\u2019s surprisingly rich lore.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nDefender's Quest Valley of the Forgotten (DX edition) is powered by the HaxeFlixel graphics engine. It\u2019s inherently rendered in 2D, but I don\u2019t regard this as a limitation. Quite the contrary, you can notice just how much the game improved since 2012, by just watching the first official clip on its Steam Store page. \u201cDeluxified\u201d, as the devs claim so eloquently. A free update which gave the title new animation sprites, an overhauled map and journal, along with redrawn cutscene characters and native support for resolutions higher than 1080p.\n\nIndeed, the fonts and the HUD itself, have scaled perfectly to 4K resolution and I never encountered a single glitch or crash. The control scheme allows for some variation on its own, by even taking into consideration keyboard layouts which aren't very common. Devs really thought of everything that can accommodate PC gamers, despite the recent console ports of their title. PC gaming may not always be a focal point, but it should never be given the \"short end of the stick\" under any circumstances. I really like the visual style present in Defender's Quest DX and I think that even the initial version looked more than decent. Now it\u2019s been streamlined and showcasing fewer visible pixels than ever before. Bravo, Level Up Labs!\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nIf only I could praise the sounds in equal measure to the game\u2019s visuals. Sadly, all we have to contend with in Defender's Quest, are a simplistic soundtrack (that\u2019s adequate, if nothing special) and a general set of sounds. No voice acting at all. While a regular, boring tower defense title could have dispensed with audio pleasantries, ours is a fascinating tale in the game I\u2019m reviewing today. Its colorful cast of unique characters, each with his or her own quirky personality, deserved more than radio silence and simply expressing themselves through subtitles. I get it, Defender's Quest was likely made on a tight budget by a few enthusiastic indie devs. \n\nSteam and gaming itself looked very different than nowadays. In 2012, I wouldn\u2019t even joke about having a Steam account and yet, a full makeover to warrant the \u201cDeluxe\u201d moniker, implies that sounds aren\u2019t playing second fiddle. Unfortunately, they aren\u2019t even part of this orchestra. They are outside the concert hall and that is far too obvious for me to overlook. Such a title deserved at least a semi-professional voice acting. Its price tag and polished quality demand it, even if this issue is not game-breaking. I'm certain that I can't be the only one who's come to expect voice acting even in indie titles of our contemporary times.\n\n[h1]Gameplay, Verdict, Summary & Rating are below in the Comment Section.[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1519913422, "timestamp_updated": 1520201246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679346", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40477134": {"recommendationid": "40477134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004094821", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519065872}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uac8c\uc784\uc740 \ud560\ub9cc\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uadfc\ub370 \ud55c\uae00\ud654\uac00 \uac1c\ud310\uc774\ub124\uc694.\n\u3141\u3141\u3141\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\uc624\ub294\ub370\ub3c4\uc788\uace0 \ubc88\uc5ed\uc548\ub41c\ubd80\ubd84\ub3c4\uc788\uace0 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\uc124\uba85\uc740 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\ucf54\ub4dc\ub97c \uad6c\uae00\ubc88\uc5ed\ud574\ub193\uc740\ub4ef\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84\ub3c4 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uadf8\ub798\uc11c \uc800\ub294 \ubcc4\ub85c\ub77c\uace0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uadf8 \ubd80\ubd84\uc744 \uac10\uc218\ud558\uace0 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ud558\uc2dc\uaca0\ub2e4\uba74\uc740 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uac8c \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744\ub4ef \ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1519874107, "timestamp_updated": 1519874107, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40451053": {"recommendationid": "40451053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120304116", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 382, "last_played": 1521604266}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "A mistura Tower Defense com RPG resultou em sucesso!

Just units and stats and enemies and some levels. Pointless. Just generating some content to make it bigger. Why would I want to waste time reading about further aspects of a bad story in a journal book? Completely uninteresting.

Sounds like a formula for a weak story and boring gameplay, right? Wrong! First of all, the writing of this game is phenomenal. It doesn't take itself too seriously, with plenty of actual laugh out loud moments for me. But it also has a pretty great story, and I actually began to care about the characters. Very well done on that front. Second, the gameplay is addictive and fun. I love the balance of classes and how they each contribute to the overall defense. I thought the ranger class was the best, but I only began to see the true awesomeness that was the Knight and the Dragon toward the end. Many, many ways to play through this game. I will be going back to see what achievements I can unlock and which missions I can beat on the hardest difficulties. \n\nTLDR: great writing, fun complex gameplay.

When I launched it, I was very very dissapointed. I felt deceived. Why does that bad game have Overwhelmingly Positive rating?\nI played for 30 minutes, deleted it and requested a refund. Some time after that, I purchased this game again, because I set a task to play and review all popular TD games. At the second glance I proved my feelings. Only after 4-5 attempt I could find something interesting in this game, so I started playing it.\n\nFor now, I completed main campaign, passed a lot of extra star missions, started new campaign with increased difficulty. \nI have a rule, if I passed the game - the game is at least not bad :D\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1290795128\n\nAuthors told that the game focuses on on three things: tactical depth, customization, and story. Yes, there are in the game. There is a story with cutscenes and a lot of text. I tried to read them in the start. I couldn't find the story interesting, so I skipped all other cutscenes. \n\nThere is customization. You could choose how your towers looks by selecting colors. You can choose which skills your hero should learn. Mostly, skill tree is the same for all units of same class. Finally, you can by items for your units. In the end of the game, all unis has the same best weapon. So, in real game, you play with units who has the same weapons, who learnt same skills, but has different hair color. Is it customization?\n\nTactical depth. This is absolute lie. I passed all campaign on normal by using same units in the same order in mostly all missions. Tactic is about making the best decisions in different situations. If you use same tactic in all situations, there can't be tactical depth.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1290795367\n\nSo, why did I give this game positive rating?\nThis game is kinda unique. It is a mix of different genres. So, this game has a lot of huge flaws, but anyway if you are TD fan, you must to try it. I am sure, someone will find the story interesting, someone will find graphics cute, someone will be happy to \"customize\" units.\n\nThe idea with leveling up units was fresh and I liked it. Missions have not enough diversity, but it is pretty funny to pass it in 20 seconds at 16x speed setting with right starting unit placement.\n\nAnd I really liked battles with bosses. \nAlso, there are some unique level which are fun too (sheep mission, all water mission and etc.)\n\nSo, the game is worth for a trying.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1290795313\n\nPros\n- Unique mix of genres. There is only one game with such gameplay\n- A lot of missions. Each has 3 modes. After completing the game, there is new huge mode unlocks\n- Interesting Boss battles\n- A lot of different game speed settings\n- Easy to learn\n\nNeutral\n- No strategy included. It's more management than TD/strategy. Level up your guys and watch how they fight.\n- Story cutscenes sometimes are annoying. But there are a lot of player who likes the story of the game.\n- Individual skill tree and equip for all units which is usually the same for all class. (best items, most useful skills)\n\nCons\n- Grind\n- Absolutely outdated graphics\n- Now screen resolution (only ~800*600 window mode)\n- Low difference between levels and enemies\n- The first 3-5 missions are really not attractive\n\n[h1]Resume[/h1]\nMy 4 attempts to plat this game were failed. It's less TD game and more Management game. Don't try to find there strategy. Game is old and definitely doesn't cost 15$... but...meanwhile, it's unique game with some cool features. If you are in TD, i recommend you at least to try this game with 66% discount.

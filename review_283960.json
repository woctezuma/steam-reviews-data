Pajama Sam's reviews have the unfortunately quality of seeming like ironical memes, so I was somewhat skeptical when grabbing them.  I'm glad I overcame my trepidation because the series -- particularly the first game -- is excellent.\n\nBasically, Pajama Sam is a pared-down point-and-click with wonderfully animated Saturday-morning-cartoon graphics and a story pitched at young children.  Despite the game's being aimed at children, there is enough cleverness in the writing -- and strangeness in the world -- that an adult can enjoy its content.  \n\nWhile Pajama Sam is \"pared down\" in comparison to Monkey Island and King's Quest V, it is considerably more complicated than most of what passes for adventure games today.  The world is larger; the puzzles are more varied (employing a mix of inventory, logic, and observational puzzles); and there is a generous helping of the kind of extra content familiar from old games: the rooms are full of hotspots that provide amusing interactions.  \n\nThe game also has a host of optional content, and every time you play the world is slightly randomized, with certain puzzles only appearing in certain games, certain areas having different significance, and certain items being moved about.  This is an odd choice because the game is not particularly replayable and there is no choice in which puzzles you get -- you might play again and have the exact same distribution of content and items -- but it is an interesting novelty all the same.\n\nIn short, this is a lovingly made and endearing game perfectly suited for kids who are learning to love adventures.  It would make an excellent entry point to the genre, one that would set them on the path of the puzzle-oriented classics, rather than in the direction of the narrative-choice model that currently prevails.", "timestamp_created": 1499472861, "timestamp_updated": 1499472861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.737342", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33245548": {"recommendationid": "33245548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080963150", "num_games_owned": 537, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498951063}, "language": "english", "review": "This was literally the first video game I ever played.

I was really worried that this game wouldn't hold up as well, playing it as an adult, but I can say that I still enjoyed the humor and the characters. Some of the animations might be a little dated, but what do you expect it's from 1996 (God I'm old). I had so much fun, I might just check out the other Pajama Sam games that are now available, as this was the only one I played as a kid.\n\nPajama Sam: NNHWIDO has basically an Alice in Wonderland-type story. Pajama Sam gets transported to the Land of Darkness through his bedroom closet, and goes on a journey through the land to vanquish Darkness, the character whom the land is so aptly named after. It's pretty simple, but that's really all it needs to be. The real focus is the humor and characters and both are just filled with so much charm. There's the boat who's afraid of water, the old mine car who's become rusted to the tracks, and the (literal) wishing well, who makes wishes when you throw him a penny. Yeah, this game's pretty weird, but that's what makes it so fun.\n\nLike I said earlier practically everything in the game reacts to you clicking it, usually in more ways than one. One item may have multiple comedic reactions to you clicking on it. Seriously try and click everything in this game, even stuff in the background that just looks like it's part of the environment. I discovered some clickables playing the game now, that I never found as a kid.\n\nThis game also has surprising replay value. There will often be different parts of the environment generated in future playthroughs that replace some from previous playthroughs. These add more to the game; more jokes, more story, more characters.\n\nEven if you aren't a kid check this game out, it's still pretty entertaining as an adult, plus it's fairly priced. It kind of reminds me of watching some of the old Cartoon Network shows I grew up with as a kid, it may be kind of old, but it's still fun.

I think this is a game that is perfect for children and those who are young at heart. Its a gentle little time waster, it has a bubblegum like taste to it. Its meant to be short, sweet, and to the point. The story in itself is extremely simplistic, almost a run of the mill point and click, but the game carries a ton of padding. Every little thing can be clicked on and is perfect for entertaining those of a young mind. This is one of the quintessential games for children, it helps build problem solving skills when presented with an assortment of choices and exploration. It can be beaten in a very short amount of time, but if you're new to adventure games it may take some time. The bottom line is that it is all good clean fun that can really be enjoyed by all ages.

For this little town lies on the boundary between two German states which we of the younger generation at least have made it our life work to reunite by every means at our disposal.\nGerman-Austria must return to the great German mother country, and not because of any economic considerations. No, and again no: even if such a union were unimportant from an economic point of view; yes, even if it were harmful, it must nevertheless take place. One blood demands one Reich. Never will the German nation possess the moral right to engage in colonial politics until, at least, it embraces its own sons within a single state. Only when the Reich borders include the very last German, but can no longer guarantee his daily bread, will the moral right to acquire foreign soil arise from the distress of our own people. Their sword will become our plow, and from the tears of war the daily bread of future generations will grow. And so this little city on the border seems to me the symbol of a great mission. And in another respect as well, it looms as an admonition to the present day. More than a hundred years ago, this insignificant place had the distinction of being immortalized in the annals at least of German history, for it was the scene of a tragic catastrophe which gripped the entire German nation. At the time of our fatherland's deepest humiliation, Johannes Palm of Nuremberg, burgher, bookseller, uncompromising nationalist and French hater, died there for the Germany which he loved so passionately even in her misfortune. He had stubbornly refused to denounce his accomplices who were in fact his superiors. In thus he resembled Leo Schlageter. And like him, he was denounced to the French by a representative of his government An Augsburg police chief won this unenviable fame, thus furnishing an example for our modern German officials in Herr Severing's Reich.\nIn this little town on the Inn, gilded by the rays of German martyrdom, Bavarian by blood, technically Austrian, lived my parents in the late eighties of the past century; my father a dutiful civil servants my mother giving all her being to the household, and devoted above all to us children in eternal, loving care Little remains in my memory of this period, for after a few years my father had to leave the little border city he had learned to love, moving down the Inn to take a new position in Passau, that is, in Germany proper.\nIn those days constant moving was the lot of an Austrian customs official. A short time later, my father was sent to Linz, and there he was finally pensioned. Yet, indeed, this was not to mean \"res\"' for the old gentleman. In his younger days, as the son of a poor cottager, he couldn't bear to stay at home. Before he was even thirteen, the little boy laced his tiny knapsack and ran away from his home in the Waldviertel. Despite the at tempts of 'experienced' villagers to dissuade him, he made his way to Vienna, there to learn a trade. This was in the fifties of the past century. A desperate decision, to take to the road with only three gulden for travel money, and plunge into the unknown. By the time the thirteen-year-old grew to be seventeen, he had passed his apprentice's examination, but he was not yet content. On the contrary. The long period of hardship, endless misery, and suffering he had gone through strengthened his determination to give up his trade and become ' something better. Formerly the poor boy had regarded the priest as the embodiment of all humanly attainable heights; now in the big city, which had so greatly widened his perspective, it was the rank of civil servant. With all the tenacity of a young man whom suffering and care had made 'old' while still half a child, the seventeen-year-old clung to his new decision-he did enter the civil service. And after nearly twenty-three years, I believe, he reached his goal. Thus he seemed to have fulfilled a vow which he had made as a poor boy: that he would not return to his beloved native village until he had made something of himself.\nHis goal was achieved; but no one in the village could remember the little boy of former days, and to him the village had grown strange.\nWhen finally, at the age of fifty-six, he went into retirement, he could not bear to spend a single day of his leisure in idleness. Near the Upper Austrian market village of Lambach he bought a farm, which he worked himself, and thus, in the circuit of a long and industrious life, returned to the origins of his forefathers.\nIt was at this time that the first ideals took shape in my breast. All my playing about in the open, the long walk to school, and particularly my association with extremely 'husky' boys, which sometimes caused my mother bitter anguish, made me the very opposite of a stay-at-home. And though at that time I scarcely had any serious ideas as to the profession I should one day pursue, my sympathies were in any case not in the direction of my father's career. I believe that even then my oratorical talent was being developed in the form of more or less violent arguments with my schoolmates. I had become a little ringleader; at school I learned easily and at that time very well, but was otherwise rather hard to handle. Since in my free time I received singing lessons in the cloister at Lambach, I had excellent opportunity to intoxicate myself with the solemn splendor of the brilliant church festivals. As was only natural the abbot seemed to me, as the village priest had once seemed to my father, the highest and most desirable ideal. For a time, at least, this was the case. But since my father, for understandable reasons, proved unable to appreciate the oratorical talents of his pugnacious boy, or to draw from them any favorable conclusions regarding the future of his offspring, he could, it goes without saying, achieve no understanding for such youthful ideas. With concern he observed this conflict of nature.\nAs it happened, my temporary aspiration for this profession was in any case soon to vanish, making place for hopes more stated to my temperament. Rummaging through my father's library, I had come across various books of a military nature among them a popular edition of the Franco-German War of 1870-7I It consisted of two issues of an illustrated periodical from those years, which now became my favorite reading matter It was not long before the great heroic struggle had become my greatest inner experience. From then on I became more and more enthusiastic about everything that was in any way connected with war or, for that matter, with soldiering\nBut in another respect as well, this was to assume importance for me. For the first time, though as yet in a confused form, the question was forced upon my consciousness: Was there a difference -and if so what difference-between the Germans who fought these battles and other Germans? Why hadn't Austria taken part in this war; why hadn't my father and all the others fought?\nAre we not the same as all other Germans?\nDo we not all belong together? This problem began to gnaw at my little brain for the first time. I asked cautious questions and with secret envy received the answer that not every German was fortunate enough to belong to Bismarck's Reich..\nThis was more than I could understand.", "timestamp_created": 1486971438, "timestamp_updated": 1486971457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494382", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29856215": {"recommendationid": "29856215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130162827", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475906935}, "language": "english", "review": "Not scared of the dark anymore. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1486843573, "timestamp_updated": 1486843573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29828901": {"recommendationid": "29828901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076546450", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485044590}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this game in my childhood.

A lot of the humor in the game I really didn't catch until I was older due to it's clever word play. I would go so far as to call this the Disney of point and click games.\n\nThe story is simple; yet very charming. Every character is interesting and full of personality. More personality than I would say a lot of current gen games have. The other thing that makes this so great is that Sam can interact with a lot of the characters, typically in multiple ways. The continuations of the dialog may not always serve a purpose, but it is definitely entertaining!\n\nThe puzzles in this game are pretty basic, yet satisfying. Nothing is ever really unclear and if you missed something or messed up, it's because you didn't look closely enough. There are, however, a few multistep puzzles that can get tricky if you aren't paying attention. I think it goes without saying that all of the puzzles are geared towards kids, so if you want something that won't be too difficult for them, this is a great choice. Definitely not as challenging as some of the Spy Fox ones were.\n\nThe other highlight of this is game is that is truly does look wonderful!

From scene to scene, each area has something new to see and experience, from throwing pennies in a well to finding gold in the mines. It isn't a straightforward gaming experience, you can take your time and not be bugged by AI characters constantly telling to you move on with the game. \n\nAlong with the main storyline, there are THREE amazing minigames to play throughout The Land of Darkness:\n\n1. The Brain Tickler: This minigame isn't much of a \"minigame\" as it is more of a game that you can experience along your way throughout the main in-depth storyline that is \"Pajama Sam: No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside\". This game contains extremely hard multiple-choice questions such as \"How is a star formed?\", and even harder \"What color is an orange?\". These are extremely difficult questions that you will have to endure to be able to get to a certain area in the diverse open world of The Land of Darkness.\n\n2. Cheese and Crackers: An extremely difficult minigame that consists of a 3x3 board where you play a toaster in a game of \"Cheese and Crackers\", a game where you must get 3 cheeses in a row before he gets 3 crackers in a row, taking turns placing down a cheese (you) and a cracker (the toaster). There are also other board sizes that you will be able to play on, but before you can even play the game, you must [spoiler]traverse the long and complex labyrinth that is the mines in order to find the gold mine, mine out the gold you find there with the pickaxe you picked up along the way, and give the gold to the toll-man that blocks your way to get to the Cheese and Crackers lounge.[/spoiler] There is no game in the world that can compare to this one.\n\n3. Remote Mining Terminal: Quite possibly the best minigame within a game of all time. In this minigame, you take control of a minecart picking up gems in a grid, and each time you pick up a stone, the cart behind you increases. It is an extremely complex game to explain in text, you have to play it in the actual game.\n\nThe storyline goes as follows: Sam is about to go to bed for the first time without his big-boy night light, but gets scared of the dark, as we all do. You must then take it upon yourself to turn into... [i]PAJAMA SAM![/i] You enter your closet to find that is The Land of Darkness, a magical land filled with toys and socks that Darkness lives in. However, you are stopped by the customs trees, which take your stuff that you must find to be able to defeat darkness. You go on a long and dangerous journey through The Land of Darkness, making lots of friends, such as a boat and a minecart, to help you find your extremely important items: a flashlight, a limited edition all metal Pajama Man lunchbox, and your mask. I will not spoil the difficult steps you must take to get said things, as each playthrough the items are in a different area, providing you replayability like there's no tomorrow.\n\nIn addition to all of this, the game comes at the price of only $6.99, an extremely low price for what you are earning in the end. I definitely recommend that you pick this game up, as there isn't another game like this with quite the content and replayability as this. \n\nI rate this game 20/20 socks, a game to end all games.", "timestamp_created": 1473297456, "timestamp_updated": 1473739741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657536", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25220833": {"recommendationid": "25220833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044439368", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 865, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472743643}, "language": "english", "review": "Minecarts.", "timestamp_created": 1472441156, "timestamp_updated": 1472441156, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.328198", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25173847": {"recommendationid": "25173847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025158752", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448315887}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm sure I'm not the only person who picked up this game due to it being featured on Vegeta's Renegade For Life series.\nOkay, I'm gonna just jump straight to the point.

It was the third series Humongous made after Putt Putt and Freddi Fish, and proved to be one of the most successful. Today it's well regarded as one of the best games that the developer ever made, and for being one of the very first games Jeremy Soule of Elder Scrolls fame worked on.\n\nThe premise is Pajama Sam is a child who is afraid of the dark. Inspired by his favorite comic book hero Pajama Man, he decides to journey into his closet to combat \"Darkness\". He finds himself trapped in \"the Lands of Darkness\". Where he must find his belongings and finally confront Darkness. What I like about the story is it has this very epic feel to it but the entire story is framed as being part of a child's imagination. The \"lands of darkness\" resemble Mordor but are littered with things you'd find in a closet like socks and lunchboxes. Moreover Pajama Sam himself is a very likeable protagonist who grows as a character over the course of his journey and it has a very nice somber ending.\n\nMuch like other Humongous games Pajama Sam also contains random elements. The locations of all of Pajama Sam's missing gadgets are randomized every playthrough. Meaning what locations are mandatory varies from playthrough to playthrough. This makes the game much more replayable, albiet to compensate for the general short length of the game. Alongside that the game has collectables in the form of socks that you can locate throughout the game. This was so well recieved that Humongous would later create a puzzle game devoted to this.\n\nAmong all of Humongous's games the Pajama Sam trilogy remains one of my favorite. It's one of my favorite adventure games and I've replayed it several times. It has a blend of polish that is very rarely seen in games even today, and I dearly recommend it to fans of children's games and fans of games that tell a good story.", "timestamp_created": 1465677102, "timestamp_updated": 1465677131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23465633": {"recommendationid": "23465633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079103865", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470633324}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS GAME OH MY GOODNESS, nostalgic af and it was beautiful.

However, tonight, it's the first time he'll sleep without the light. He really wants to do it but he's afraid of Darkness, a evil enemy. So, he turns into Pajama Sam, a super-hero and is resolved to capture his nemesis so that he can sleep without fear....\n\nPajama Sam: No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside is a game aimed at children: it's a point-&-click adventure, with minigames in it, though they're not all needed to advance. The story can also speak for the little ones: it's showing Sam willing to sleep without light and getting over his fears. Kids can relate to him.\n\nBut to manage to do so, Sam is living an extraordinary adventure: he looses his flashlight, lunchbox and mask because trees are stealing them and before confronting Darkness, he needs to find them and retrieve them. Sam will have to show for example to Otto the boat that wood is floating, to oil the wheels of the wagon, etc..\n\nWhat I realized is that the game is random: indeed, you have each time two possible locations for the items and so, a different solution for them (for example, the mask was with the carrot, I had to free the carrots in the fridge to get it - however, the mask would have been in the dance room, I would have made an invisibility potion). And I also liked the fact that you can choose your path in the mine. It means that you can find new locations, useful or not depending the \"storyline\" thrown at you. And as you're also in a quest to retrieve all socks in the game, some of them are there - be quick to click on them as Sam will not stop at them.\n\nThere is a minigame where you need to answer questions. And while one of them is tied to Darkness's domain, the others are about culture. However, I don't know if knowing how much fuel does a space shuttle need is pertinent. It's something very specific. Other questions were more general like the artist having paint Mona Lisa or the dinosaurs. There are also a Tic-Tac-Toe with crackers and cheese, a Snake-like game, a music room where you can hear several tunes, a laboratory where you can make many potions, ...\n\nWhile I found the gameplay nice, Pajama Sam is also a testimony of its era: the '90. Indeed, in educational games or in children games, you tend to throw a lot of information. Big Thinkers, from the same developers/publishers, if you remember my review, were also full of items you can click and look at a special animation. Many easter eggs are also included: you can find Freddi Fish and Luther, Putt-Putt and Pep, characters from the same house.\n\nAnother thing is a testimony of the '90: the graphics themselves. However, contrary to Big Thinkers, Pajama Sam seems to have less aged. The soundtrack is also good.\n\nThe good surprise was the fact that the game is in French (and support other languages). It means that children will not need adults to translate or help them understand a foreign word. While the adults are still needed for anything else, it's a burden in less for them, particulary if they're not fluent at all with English.\n\nBut there is a little problem too: the inventory is showing itself by putting the cursor at the bottom of the screen. It's how you can find the menu too. There is no main menu, no tutorial about the keys to use, etc.. I had to search in a forum how to save, after having to exit the game and come back later - no progress was saved. I don't know if I was expecting it to be saved as in Big Thinkers but the lack of a profile was my first clue to that. So if you need to save and load, press S and L. It's apparently something related to the system used so that the game can run on recent machines.\n\nPajama Sam is really a good little moment for both children and adults. It may also be an help to get over fears. If I look into the second title, it's about thunders, so, I suppose that Pajama Sam was conceived to help children understand that some of their fears can be conquered. Anyway, if you search for a good children games, Pajama Sam should be considered to be in your list.", "timestamp_created": 1464854778, "timestamp_updated": 1464854778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.682063", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23275247": {"recommendationid": "23275247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087834803", "num_games_owned": 2958, "num_reviews": 150, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467318996}, "language": "english", "review": "Short and easy point & click adventure with great voice work and some clever writing.

For some games, this would be a disaster waiting to happen, but in the case of Pajama Sam, this is done almost consistently masterfully, holding back information on such subjects such as the location of the flashlight or what color an orange is. Many have critisized the holding of frames later in the series, but taken into the context of the fact they were running out of money to make the game, is is understandable.\n\nFor many fans, their major criticism of the game is the handling of the ending, which many consider far too 'out there' and simply crap. I too, am not a huge fan of the ending, but taking the ending to the game, inside the context of the 'true' ending sequel, Pajama Sam 3: You are what you Eat from your Head to your Feet, the ending can make a lot more sense, and thus I enjoy it far, far more. To stop me from ranting on for ages, Pajama Sam's story is a master stroke in writing, one which has been a hard feat to replicate.\n\nArt and Sound: I was introduced to Pajama Sam through the in-progress tetraology of games, The Rebuild of Pajama Sam; due to this, I became used to the cutting edge graphics employed for the higher-budget games. And to be honest, yes, the original game's art is beginning to show it's age 20 years on; however, this does not detract from the series in any major capcity, as the art compliments the anime extremely well.\n\nThe sound is also fantastic, and a very high-point for the show. Excellent music is employed to showcase the chaos of finding your lost socks, and for darker moments such as the internal struggles of the main cast of the game. Some of Beethoven's music is featured later in the series, which coupled with the emotional impact of the scene, produces one of the most excellent scenes in video game history.\n\nCharacters: By a massive leap, the highlight of the series. Pajama Sam features in it's story the struggles of the main characters, to devastatingly wonderful effect. Weak, timid, daddy-issues Sam, to powerful, arrogant, egotistical Mom, to the quiet, mysterious Boat, and the brooding, apparently agnostical Darkness, Pajama Sam develes into the mind and motivations of these characters, showcasing exactly what makes them tick, and this is what gives us some of gaming's most regonisable and wonderful characters.\n\nI am certain entire essays have been written on why certain charcters tick, and that's another reason so many of these characters are so wonderful. Fans are so devoted to their favorite characters (personally I am partial to Mom and Boat), and this creates a wonderful feeling when learning about these characters and then discussing this with other fans. Generally, Pajama Sam employs some of the most human characters in games, showing us that the heroes of gaming aren't always strong, both mentally and physically, or not even in control of their lives.\n\nIn closing, Pajama Sam is one of the strongest games ever produced. It employs powerful characters, a deep, deep story, and art that has only just began to show it's age. What makes the game's longevity even more powerful is that even now on sites such as PJSamGeeks people are still analysing this series, trying to know everything about it. I hope Pajama Sam will live on in the hearts of it's fans, who'll continue to appreciate it's deep, metaphorical story. I hope that Pajama Sam will always remain an game that will be treasured, for all the ages.", "timestamp_created": 1460171008, "timestamp_updated": 1465509197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468338", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22308307": {"recommendationid": "22308307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027620247", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 277, "last_played": 1514218088}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1460155054, "timestamp_updated": 1460155054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529412", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22307649": {"recommendationid": "22307649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035121177", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461210628}, "language": "english", "review": "Got this game originally in a cereal box.

For real? You're favorite games are The Last of Us and Spec Ops: The Line! Those games are INTENSE! And you're suggesting a kid's educational game from the 90's belongs up at the top of the list with some of the greatest games ever?\" \n\nIn my opinion? Yeah.\n\nSee, Pajama Sam was a game DESIGNED for kids, but the developers had enough mind to add enough humor that only adults would get. I'm not saying there are any sex jokes, and there aren't, but there are plenty of jokes that I know would go over most kids' heads. The game is also much more maturely designed. Of all of the Humongous Games, you mainly are told specifically what to do (Spy Fox, Freddi Fish), or you meet completely foolish characters that tell you what they need but are more than capable of getting the job done themselves (Putt Putt). But Pajama Sam did something different... it plays with empathy. Think about it. You run into situations, and mainly Sam reacts to the situation or you- the player- does. Otto can't go out on the river, just as he can't move along the land since he's a boat. The King can't move because he's rusted to the track. For the few seconds you speak with each character, you feel sorry for their problems (mainly Otto's stupidity) and solve them yourself.\n\nThe game also does incredibly well with it's design. The artwork is beautiful to look at, and the way each frame is shot to emphasize different perspectives and imply you can move in different directions makes the game very clear and concise. It's not like some point-and-click games where you stumbled across a door fifteen times and didn't notice it till you looked up the FAQ on the game. And, yes, the game is simple. It is easy. But, like I once told my ex, it doesn't have to be hard to be good. The voice acting is decent. as are all the sound effects, and the music is very ambient and creates a lively atmosphere.\n\nThe game revolves around a large puzzle for one of your three lost items, and each item has two randomly-selected puzzles that can be mixed and matched any which was, creating a lot of different \"games\" for you to play through. Of course, I got each different puzzle for the missing items after playing three times. But with this, and the 20 missing socks you can find, Pajama Sam could take up roughly 2-3 hours for you to play in its entirety, where you can take 40 minutes of your day to sit down and relax to the Land of Darkness.\n\nPajama Sam may not look like much, but of all the old point-and-click games I've played as a child, this one certainly has a lot more substance to it. There were the second and third official ones (we don't talk about the fourth), but the first one really got a strong identity for the character of Pajama Sam and his world of imagination. It's no masterpiece, and I'll never try to sell it like it is, but it is really, really, really good. It's a lot better than a lot of games I've played out there. Granted, it may not be for everyone, but it still is worth checking out for anyone looking for a very unique video game.", "timestamp_created": 1447123204, "timestamp_updated": 1447123484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500151", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18918788": {"recommendationid": "18918788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129675900", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508300552}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember the good ol' days when computer gaming was brand new and innovative.

Sure, I hold this game on the nostalgic pedestal a bit, but not without good reason. \n   Now about the Steam version: I'm a bit disappointed. I've ran my original copy in the Scumm engine before and reached the same performance differences here: voice dialogue loads faster then normal, so characters talking in cutscenes sound like they don't take a break to breathe and just go into the next sentence. Here and there I see animations changed or cut out altogether, particularly during the intro dialogue with King where he says \"Loop-de-Loops\" and his face doesn't move. The game is still fully playable, but these emulation problems still got to me. It would be unreasonable to recommend getting an original copy and seeing for yourself, as this game was designed for Windows '95 and the like; the game would most certainly not work without a virtual machine.

The plot is based on a comic that the main character, Pajama Sam, reads. He is on a mission to venture into his closet and defeat darkness so he won't have to be afraid of the dark anymore. You mainly click around to go to different screens and explore. You can talk to other characters, pick up items, and click on various parts of the environments as well for reactions or clues. And key locations of items are changed between playthroughs, giving it a few different ways to play. There's a lot of voicework in the game, with many characters having multiple dialogues for continued clicks. There's also a good amound of music and lots of sound effects to help go along with the colorful, cartoon style. You'll need to use a bit of problem solving for getting items and figuring out where to use them. There are even a few minigames to try out. Plus, there's a side quest for the more adventurous players to try and collect 10 pairs of socks. The socks are hidden throughout the game so you'll have 20 to try and spot as you search the screens of the game. It's a nice little touch for some extra challenge. Oh, and some of the humor is actually pretty good.\n\nHowever, there are problems with this game. While there are many things to click on in any given location, a majority of them are simply there as goofy asides. There are typically a variety of different reactions for each item, but all they do is distract you from the main game. They don't really add much atmosphere, instead generally being there to keep kids entertained. It makes sense, sure, but it's not really something I'd call good game design, regardless of the target audience. There are even a few parts that don't have any real point to them, depending on which random set of circumstances the game gives you on your playthrough. Sometimes areas will have things to interact with but no reason to do so. Not that the extra bits aren't nice for a little more world there, or possibly an area to house a sock or two, but they don't feel necessary enough to include without looking at it as padding just a little bit. There also doesn't seem to be much reason to get all the socks. Not that there NEEDS to be a reward, and possibly there is as I missed a few, but it seems like the game just ends and doesn't really give you much incentive to go get them other than just wanting to do it for yourself. \n\nOverall, it's a surprisingly solid game. I just randomly won it in a giveaway and figured it was going to be some lame kids' game. It actually isn't too bad. It could do more, do some things better, and be more challenging... but I understand its for kids that would probably spend more time figuring it out as it is. I didn't grow up with this game. I'm not blinded by nostalgia. I just thought it was genuinely a nice little experience. My only gripe is that it costs 7 bucks. That's a bit steep for this game, unless you're actually getting it for a kid. If you're getting it to check it out and you're not a kid, especially considering it's on Steam, then you're better off waiting for a sale to get it for only a few bucks. I wouldn't say it's worth full price, but if you're curious, it IS worth checking out.

Beat it again and again and made us smarter in a way. Pajama Sam: No Need To Hide When It's Dark Outside is the most cleverly written children's game I've ever played. It also looks charming, has a great soundtrack, and three different routes each time you start from the beginning. It's enjoyable for kids and adults, and you won't regret giving it a try.\n\nA key element for any children\u2019s adventure game is voice acting \u2013 if the performances aren\u2019t engaging, it\u2019s likely that interest will be lost quickly. Thankfully, every moment you spend with these characters is a delight thanks to the brilliant and varied voices. Ranging from Sam\u2019s high and chirpy voice to Otto\u2019s hesitant and slightly wary style to the quiz show door\u2019s enthusiastic zeal, each actor injects a highly distinctive personality into their respective roles. The music complements this perfectly, with upbeat tunes keeping the mood light while mixing in the occasional chime to add an unearthly air. Music even takes part in the game itself, with furniture dancing in secret and kitchen appliances singing about their functions.\n\nThe trees are just a sample of the unusual characters that will make an appearance. Sam is the only human (if you can call him that) in this world, an innocent and friendly young boy who is keen to assist others. Along the way he\u2019ll encounter a toaster, a coat stand and a fridge, to name but a few of the everyday items that have come to life. The most memorable are Otto the boat and King the mine cart, both of whom you\u2019ll help out with their troubles. They act as modes of transport, and thus you\u2019ll spend more time connecting with them than anyone else. It\u2019s a shame other minor characters don\u2019t play a bigger role, because everyone has a unique personality (such as the carrot trying to rescue his friends from being used in a salad and the over-worked water well) and I\u2019d have liked to interact more with this colourfully assorted cast.", "timestamp_created": 1418437198, "timestamp_updated": 1486409330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509108", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13324759": {"recommendationid": "13324759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047010251", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1398105114}, "language": "english", "review": "pajama sam goes so hard in the muthafucking paint nigga watcha thank nigga\nme and my friends when we are sucking diicks and talking about pajama sam: http://gfycat.com/AntiqueHospitableBluebird", "timestamp_created": 1418353648, "timestamp_updated": 1418353648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13283703": {"recommendationid": "13283703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081469067", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417179459}, "language": "french", "review": "jeu plein de nostalgie ! il m'as fait retourner en enfance !", "timestamp_created": 1418056566, "timestamp_updated": 1418056566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13191143": {"recommendationid": "13191143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030640036", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488853643}, "language": "english", "review": "I have never been so scared in my entire life.

This game can change your life, your lifestyle, your friends and even more! If even a terrorist plays this game, he might will be thinking: \"Holy Allah! It was lied to me to fear darkness! Thank you Pajama Sam! *Boom.*\nI thought that the darkness would violate me at night, but with this game, i fought against this fear! I've beaten it, just because it black (Just American Style!)\n\nBut now to be serious: I pooped in my pants. It was scarier than Slender, or even more than Amnesia!\nAfter all, after playing this game and beating the fear to darkness, i sadly was not able to find all socks! I was in rage! Over 9000 people died, after all i screamed \"RAHHHHHHHHHHH!\" with a poop-laser coming out of my nose. It was a huge mess! Might it was not my fault, but this game even can make you traumatized of everything you did in your life. I don't know.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty funny compared to Grand Theft Auto 5.  The characterdesign of The Last of Us is nothing compared to the character \"Otto the Boat\"! I love you Otto. #BrosB5Hoes (because 5 is higher than 4.)\n\nThe graphics of this game is pretty fascinating! Even Leonardo Da Vinci's art is nothing compared to the draw-style of this amazing game.\n\nGot to love the 480x640 Resolution and the 30 Frames-Per-Second. That's so Next-Gen!\n\n\n\n[Please do not take this Review seriously. It is just meant for a joke, and i don't want to make any racist jokes, or what so ever. All in one, i can prefer this game...

Try not to rage when the purple dancing couch doesn't get off your mask though. Not only is this game a spooky and fun past time, but I also learned about gysers and physics. Pajama Sam weighs less than 3 rocks so we needed 3 rocks in the opposite basket to lift Sam in his basket to get us into the house that Darkness lives in. I'm confident in physics now thanks to this game!

When I heard that they had created a game which would utilize the elements of their art/animation style, I was estatic! I had been well aware of their talent for character design, their funky style of animation, and their incredible way of creating such beautiful, intricate, colorful backgrounds! For the longest time, I wasn't able to buy the game and kept myself from spoilers as much as I could. I kept my ground and pushed through, until I was finally able to purchase the game today!\n\nWithout a doubt, it was well worth the wait. For such a short, simple, little game, it brought me so much emotion and enjoyment. Each character, though given small interactions with Maggie, has their own diverse personality and uniqueness! I fell absolutely in love with these characters! They're all so varied in design, dialogue, story. It's pretty amazing! The background design is just as beautiful as I hoped it would be. All of the fractals of color within each background stuck out to me a lot! I love the care put into it all! I love the way each piece of the game fits together into something so humorous and charming. Figuring out each piece of the puzzle was so fun and honestly scary at times!! I felt so mant emotions for Maggie's struggle, as well as Beauty's....hell...even Dunc's! It was an incredible experience all around and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys well written characters, story, and gorgeous artistry! \n\nI'd also highly recommend this game to anyone who has experiences with trauma or abuse? As silly as it may seem, this game and its story provided a lot of comfort for me as someone who has been through many experiences with abuse/sexual harrassment/manipulation/or otherwise. It's a very comforting, loving story with so much care and so much humor, so much turmoil and so much struggle. I couldn't ask for a better game from 'Tola. Keep 'em coming, bud!

But let me tell you why it's so good.\n\nAs a game, the puzzles are mostly simple and make sense. You have no inventory so it's a very streamlined experience. The bulk of the game is conversations with Maggie's neighbors, which are done through the thin walls of her apartment, so you don't see most of them visually. However, the conversations are where the game shines. The neighbors, despite being a voice on the other side of a wall, all come off as fleshed out people, they feel real. The quality of the writing and voice acting was my favorite part of this game. I was honestly impressed by what I thought was a low-budget indie-game. And grew to like several of the characters, which I also think is the mark of good writing.\n\nTo speak to sound design, as someone who lives in New York City, and played this game with headphones, I had to take my headphones off a few times to check if the sounds I was hearing where in-game, or outside my own apartment building. The credits page is 2 screens long, and the second page is sound licensing, so if you want a true big-city sound experience, this game does it the best I've ever heard. The goofy sound effects are fun, but the real city noises I did have trouble distingusing from in-game, or the real city outside my own window.\n\nYou are sometimes given dialog path decisions to determine the other character's opinion of Maggie. Though I feel the scope of the game requires only one true path through the game, I still enjoyed the occasional \"I agree\", \"No you're wrong!\" option, and it makes me consider a second play-through to see what would happen if I picked other options. Again, the conversations are the strong point, so I would want to hear more of them. I also enjoyed the prerogative this game has that this binary decision isn't \"good\" or \"bad\" and more \"what would advance the plot\" so you are sometimes forced into picking what would normally be \"bad\" because you know it's the only way the story would make sense. Which is a nice diversion from the triple-A \"moral\" games, which get on my nerves, and I enjoyed the dedication to story in this game.\n\nAs stated before, the game is short, it took me a little over 2 hours to get from beginning to end. But it is very much a mystery story. Throughout the game they hint at what the conclusion could be, and I drew my own conclusions based on the clues, and while I was close, the ending took me by surprise. And I very much enjoyed not only the ending to the story, but the the plot wrap-up where everything was completely explained by the information already given, which I think is the mark of a good mystery story.\n\n\nWatch the trailer, the last quarter is actual gameplay, it'll give you a sense of the animation and visual quality. But the bulk of the game is in story telling, and character development that is really the quality of this game. The single conversation the trailer shows with a character is so limited, and that's really the game's strength. It's a fun mystery, lead by conversations, and I think the trailer relies too much on the artistic style, which ends up being a small part of the experience.\n\nI enjoyed my time with Maggie, and would reccomend it to others.", "timestamp_created": 1505595854, "timestamp_updated": 1505682678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34945839": {"recommendationid": "34945839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067543686", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505331819}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm just gonna start with some complaining to get it out of the way, but trust me, if I didn't like this game, I wouldn't bother to write this.\n\nFirst, the tone is kind of all over the place. One minute I'm cackling at a cactus elaborately dissing the sun, the other it's the genuinely tragic story about lies, manipulation and attempted murder. \n\nDidn't really get why we had to painstakingly give the police guy four bottles one by one and watch him drink each of it. I thought that maybe it was going to be a plotpoint later, like Randy gets angry that you gave away X beer bottles, but nope?\n\nBeauty's voiceacting sounds a little too bored and emotionless. It's cute in small doses, but she has to dramatically narrate at the end a lot. I really enjoyed Shrimp and Cheesey's voices, though.\n\nI'm also still confused whether Beauty and Dunc are the actual inhabitants of this world, or Maggie just imagined herself some friends. I mean, Randy knew about Beauty's existence, but all the other characters we see look humanoid.\n\nAside from that, I really like the artwork (hell, I basically bought the game because of it), and the characters are fun and likeable. The bit with the cop and the pirated music made me laugh out loud.\n\nI love that this game has a retro feeling to it. It's like I'm playing some old point-and-click adventure from the classic era, I have a huge soft spot for that.\n\nAlso, I gotta say, it would've been really easy to ridicule a fat girl who watches TV in her undies all day and gushes about her flamboyant husbando, but the game just lovingly pokes fun at her, and I respect that.\n\nAs someone who also tried developing games in a team of two people, I kinda admire the way you managed to cut so many corners. The game takes place in one room, you never see most of the characters you talk to, the major plotpoint is described over the radio, the main character is a simplified white blob that's easy to animate, the other two major characters are just a cactus and a radish... And I don't mean it in a bad way, since a) the game is short enough so that you don't get tired of it b) the voiceacting adds more character to the people we can't see c) it's claustrophobic, but it fits Maggie, who doesn't go out much and just focuses on her boyfriend. It's so cleverly low-budget, it's impressive.\n\nOverall, a cute little experience. Can't say I didn't have fun.

Its fantastic visuals and simple yet satisfying game play make this a must have.\n\nThe artwork and animation are visually stunning.  Character movements are not programmed sprite sliding around on the screen but rather fully animated natural movements.  Maggie bounces, shakes and shimmies at every interaction.  There are few backgrounds, but this is to the effect of the creative design.  But the backgrounds that are included feel lived in and characterize Maggie and her world.\n\nThe game play mechanics are a simplified form of point and click. The entire game takes place in Maggie\u2019s apartment. Her only interactions are to her house plants and her neighbors through the walls. You would think this would make the game feel small and restrictive, but it doesn\u2019t, there is a lot to learn talking to the walls.  Further, Maggie cannot pick up any items. Instead you drag items as the lay in her apartment to what you want to interact with.  This works really well, since you never leave the apartment, it is very intuitive and lets Maggie assemble the mess she lives in.  The game play is simple and revolves around the concept of discovery.  It is not so much as puzzling out how to do something but discovering solutions.\n\nVoice acting in the game was brilliant as well.  Characters were well developed and every voice personified them perfectly.  No phoned in acting here, accents (albeit cartoonish) were well done and unique to the characters. Even the sound engineering was spot on.  Voices were muffled in a way that made you feel like you were listening through walls.  Moreover, the radio in the apartment played music which doubled as the menu to control sound in the game (clever).\n\nMaggie\u2019s Apartment is fine example of excellent writing.  Maggie is deeply flawed and incredibly endearing.  For the entire story, Maggie is mostly naked and exposed, while in the supposed safety of her apartment. In contrast the private and intimate lives of those around her seep through the walls easily.  Even outside Maggie\u2019s apartment the game makes a point to show that everything going on around is completely exposed. These concepts re-enforce the revelation of the truth. And, without spoiling the game to much, its conclusion is wonderful. The dialogue is engrossing and with every revelation I was eager to learn more.  Plotting and theme are creative and build an argument that has very real truth to it. Put simply, this game is written splendidly.\n\nMaggie's Apartment scores perfect tens on all counts. Art and animation were lively, voice acting and music where brilliant, and the game play was simple yet fun. But the star of the show was the well written story.

Now that I've played it, would I say that my hype was deserved? Yes, absolutely.\n\nMaggie's Apartment is a wonderful game, and it feels like a love letter to the kind of wonder and excitement that 90s point-and-click games held back in their heydey, and especially the charm of the Humongous Entertainment games. The animation style, while largely minimal, does exactly what it needs to, and combined with the offbeat character designs feels charming and friendly to look at. The warmth of the visuals also provides an interesting contrast to the sorrows of the plot, but you'll have to find out exactly how for yourself. The writing and voicework for the game is also top-notch, as every character's voice and dialogue feels completely natural to them, and the writing feels clever without being smarmy or annoying.\n\nThe game is not without its flaws, but I'd say largely they're the kind of flaws that the majority of point-and-click games suffer from. Figuring out how to progress can be baffling and require solutions that are hard to logically reach unless you remember the old point-and-click gameplay standby of \"examine everything, try to combine every object with every other object, exhaust every dialogue choice\". The minimalist animation style, while charming, also means that during some of the conversations (and some of them go on for QUITE a while, as some characters love to talk about nothing in order to cover up the SOMETHING that's the real issue they're having) there's not a lot to look at, and I found myself looking away from the game during these points, which felt like a crime, because it IS a very beautiful game.\n\nIf you're a point-and-click fan, or someone who loves to play games for character intriuge, or who loves the look of hand-drawn animation, I'd absolutely recommend the game. I would not recommend it for kids (unless you got some weird kids) because as charming as the style is, the game deals with some fairly dark concepts here and there, and the ending is fairly intense.

She's a cute, short, chubby girl who is WAY too lost in her hopeless romantic outlook, just like me! It was honestly a bit humbling to see a character so much like myself in a story like this. I feel wonderful after playing this, because I really feel like I UNDERSTAND what Maggie goes through. It's not just a surface-level conflict, even if it is a bit SILLY of a conflict.\n\nIn short, this game was fantastic.

It feels like you're learning just as much about Maggie and her relationships as you are about the mystery. I'm not going to spoil what happens, but the game definitely has some interesting commentary on celebrity culture and idolization.\n\nI really like the art style in this. It has kind of an 80's quality to it, for lack of a better description. Lots of highly-saturated colors and dramatic, rubbery character designs reminiscent of the work of Craig McCracken or David Feiss (the person who animated this is a Calarts student if you couldn't already tell). I dig the designs of Rascal and Randy in particular- they're both very funny and memorable. I know it's not a huge deal for point n' click games to be hand-animated, but I think it's honorable here nonetheless, especially given how much care is given when it comes to basic movements, like climbing onto a couch.\n\nAs with many point n' click adventure games, Maggie's Apartment can be a little cryptic sometimes- there are points where you have to exhaust every single character's dialogue options (sometimes multiple times) to advance the plot. Keep that in mind particularly when talking to Rascal. The game also doesn't explain this right away, but instead of having an inventory, you just click and drag objects in the room to other objects. Sometimes both objects are move-able, and sometimes only one, like when objects need to interact with the window or the Randy poster. \n\nI was kind of hoping the game would have some branching paths, but it appears to be a series of puzzles based around a linear, predetermined path.

It's a genre with a lot of very interesting experiments.\n\nThis is a quirky, charming, extremely experimental little game that revolves around a neat twist. The artstyle is simplistic but has a kind of old style caricature comic strip charm to it. There's a few inconsistencies with the animation, but It's pretty obvious this was done on a student's budget so it's perfectly excusable and the personality of the protagonist in all of her little actions makes up for it. The game also has a kind of dark sense of humor, but it's subdued and doesn't overdo it.\n\nAs it is a priced release, I do have to point a few things out though. Even by point and click standards, some clues and overall the progression of events the player must trigger to move things forward can be especially vague. The ability to actually drag items isn't really even hinted and I only discovered it after fanatical clicks on the screen by accident. There's a minor glitch involving the mini fridge becoming unclickable (that has an easy fix as stated on the hub. Nonetheless though, I gotta note it.). The game crashed a few times when accessing the menu for me as well.\n\nFinally, in the \"not bad not good\" notes territory...the game is quite short. Not necessarily a negative, as the game is obviously a bit of an experiment and short and to the point can be a big plus. However aspects of the story, keeping things as vague as possible in order to avoid spoilers, go unresolved by the end. The game concludes its main plot well enough, but there's a certain something big that isn't really explained. I can only assume it's meant to be interpretive, but it might leave some confused as there isn't really even much in way of hint as to what to make of said detail.\n\nAll and all though, it's an interesting little experimental scene of a game. A part of me does wish it were a bit longer perhaps, but that's kind of a good thing to. Just know that it is just that, an experiment. I might say as well that  for the type of game it is and the short length...it might be a bit overpriced, however it's certainly not a purchase I regret.

As for me... I had some suspension of disbelief, but it quickly spiraled away with events that made little to no sense. I figure I wasn't this game's target audience, and I base that on how the game goes from being silly to serious as a heart attack... and I sort of only value serious material I can connect with.

Throughout the story, you meet a variety of colorful characters, most of them non-human. The dialogue itself if wonderful, and the jokes throughout the game are clever, silly, and downright smart. I am a sucker for good dialogue, so this game was an honest treat.\nThe story itself is very cute, and at the same time, kind of heart-wrenching towards the end. The game, however, relies on point-and-click and some puzzle solving to progress the story. I am not fond of point & click games, but I love a good puzzle. This game had a nice blend of the two, and I was invested enough in the story to get past the point-and-click aspect of the game. The difficulty is also not too hard. There are some spots that had me stumped for a little while, but I was able to progress through trial and error. Some parts were a little confusing, and the first real obstacle was finding out you can drag items to make them interact with other objects and such.\nThe art style is interesting but unique. I loved Maggie's design and the general art direction of the game. The sound effects and movement of the characters were perfect, and it didn't take away from the story or immersion at all. The animation is a bit choppy, but once you get used to it after a few minutes of playing, you really start to appreciate the style. There were a few instances, however, where the sound felt out of place or too low. This is not a serious problem and is easily overlooked.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game to anyone that's a fan of adventure, point & click, or just a good story in general.\n10/10, would get emotional over a radish again.", "timestamp_created": 1501745967, "timestamp_updated": 1501745967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33984600": {"recommendationid": "33984600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052457456", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501730063}, "language": "english", "review": "A lovely gem of a game, and one that nails a very peculiar note of cheerful uneasiness so skillfully.

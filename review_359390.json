A guide also comes in handy if you're gunning for certain endings, especially when some of the choices you have to make to reach those endings often feel unintuitive or going against everything you have ever learnt about romance [spoiler] *cough cough* literally everything involving Toma. [/spoiler] \n\nWhile it doesn't matter which world you choose first, I recommend chosing Clover World first; Kent's good storyline is the least popular but it is also the most straight forward. Playing it gives you a good grip on the style and characters  [spoiler] not to mention, Kent is bae and I found his good ending to be the most romantic... just remember to keep a calculator handy if you aren't good at math [/spoiler]\n\nThe characters aree great and are very real. Unlike some otome games which make idealized archetypical characters, Amnesia boys have major flaws. When getting to know them, it's things that you work through with them and sometimes things you can't get past. This really humanized the characters for me, and at times made me go against the guides and completely change the ending I was heading towards. \n\nThere are a few cons. One, the female lead really has no personality since most of her thoughts are spoken through Orion (basically a spirit stuck in your memories), and when one is suggested, she seems really unlikeable. I think this is probably done so that we the players can insert our own personality on to her, but it honestly is a pet peeve of mine within the genre. Two, everyone is really sex negative, but especially other women and the romantic leads towards the main character. Three, [spoiler] I often wanted to date Sawa more than the guy I was supposed to want to date... Bi people problems\t[/spoiler]\n\nThe game is really well done, with loads of replayability and mini games.

The tag of \"visual novel\" feels like a more accurate description of this game as there is a lot of reading (I don't see this as a bad point but some might because there actually is a decent amount) and not a whole lot of involvement from the player's character (the protagonist's dialogue is relatively short and infrequent), however, which I found to be slightly disappointing as I feel these games should be a bit more immersive to make the story really hit home with the player. It's also not very clear at all which dialogue is suitable to choose for the ending the player wants to receieve most of the time (some of the dialogue options seem tremendously similar and it started to feel a little bit repetitive in some places).

I thoroughly enjoyed this game, playing through each route and the plethora of endings (good, normal and bad) for each world, and clocking up an impressive 35.7 hours of gameplay - definitely the most I've played on a visual novel before.\n\nFive fully-fleshed out, divergent storylines with a multitude of interesting characters - including five very eligible love interests - who have their own independant histories and plots that differ from world to world is an incredible feat from what I've seen of visual novels/otomes so far. The art for this game was absolutely stunning, the dialogue refreshing and funny, and the payoffs - when they came - incredibly satisfying. The CG's in particular were very well-crafted, and I'm so happy to see them have an independant gallery so you can review them once you've completed the story!\n\nThere was some repetition to the conversations the Heroine had with Orion, but this was negligible in comparison to the sheer amount of original content packed into each storyline. The \"Skip Read\" function assisted greatly in multiple playthoughs of the same world, ensuring I flipped through what I had already seen but didn't miss what I hadn't when pursuing the multitude of endings available.\n\nDespite the so far glowing review, this game isn't without it's flaws. Some of the plot was cringeworthy at best, downright horrifying at worst, and the way certain love interests behaved at times was almost enough to turn me off one of the routes. Yet, I persisted with it and I'm very glad I did because all personal feelings aside, the world in question was one that had me on the edge of my seat the entire time - not so much for the romantic conclusion, but the wider one.\n\nI still thoroughly enjoyed the ride, even the parts of the game I can't agree with. Clover and Joker were by far my favorite worlds; the latter in particular I wasn't expecting to like as much as I did, considering all I knew about the character from the other routes. It managed to surprise me with its depth, both of the character in question and the plot he was involved in. It wasn't until I reached the end of this route that I understood the way everything was connected, and how it came together from there was marvelous; I was quite emotional when the last \"good ending\" CG popped up, and even thinking about it gets me a little teary.\n\nI've added some observations on the heavier themes in this game under the cut below. They aren't necessary for the review, but something I thought I'd include anyway for anyone who has already played the game:\n\n[spoiler]\nThe discussion surrounding Ukyo's mental illness was brief (a passing line, even) but incredibly important, and upon learning of his plight I couldn't help but be sympathetic to the part of him that had struggled with such horrifying death for so long.\n\nI feel that in comparison to this, Toma's character was done a disservice in that no such discussion was extended to his actions in either Heart or Diamond; actions which weren't quite as drastic as Ukyo's, but were felt more keenly by the player when the game refused to give us a choice in how to handle it, especially in Diamond. To me, the final choice in Joker made all the difference in allowing me to control how I ended things, and whether or not I extended that forgiveness to Ukyo for all he had done.\n\nI wish we'd seen an official explanation of Toma's illness and how this resolved in his world. 'Oh, so you returned my feelings after all? Guess I'll stop gaslighting, drugging and caging you now' wasn't a good enough \"good\" ending in my opinion, and the lack of this follow-through ultimately bumps my preference for Diamond from the \"good\" ending to the \"normal\" one. I don't hate Toma, but I wish the game did more to get us to understand him like it did it's other love interests. [/spoiler] \n\nAll in all, Amnesia\u2122: Memories was a fun, entertaining, well-rounded game that equal parts shocked and delighted me.

For the simple reason that there are no \"fairy-tale relationships\", \"dream guys\" and \"pink veil of first love\" throughout the storyline. The main story tells of an ordinary girl with amnesia, but in an unusual world. Monochrome colors of streets, strange NPC's clothes and much more. However, all this does not prevent you from completely immersing yourself in the wonderful atmosphere of the Amnesia game universe. On the contrary, all this monotonousness and undisclosed backgrounds help to understand the colorful and non-ordinary characters of the main characters. Submission of the main story is very dosed, not boring and interesting. Throughout the gameplay, until the last game minutes, you are not left intrigue and a lot of thinking in an attempt to find answers to such questions as, \"Why don't I remember anything?\", \"Who are all these people? \" and \"Can they be trusted?\" The visual part is also performed very well, similar quality of the picture is rare, and more often, the latest and popular Japanese novels for portable consoles.

As CGs s\u00e3o ainda mais maravilhosas. Al\u00e9m disso, a ideia de vozear os personagens \u00e9 simplesmente genial; creio que isso nos conecta ainda mais com ele e com sua hist\u00f3ria. Cada voz reflete bem a personalidade de cada um.\n\nOs personagens t\u00eam personalidades completamente diferentes, o que nos leva a ficar cada vez mais envolvidas com eles e, por conseguinte, com as diferentes hist\u00f3rias que a protagonista tem com eles. Os desenvolvedores souberam muito bem, por exemplo, manter em segredo todos os mist\u00e9rios at\u00e9 a rota do Ukyo - a qual s\u00f3 \u00e9 liberada ap\u00f3s jogarmos com todos os outros 4 personagens. O plot da hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 muito bem desenvolvido, bem sustentado pelo pr\u00f3prio jogo - e n\u00e3o algo bem aleat\u00f3rio. \n\nOs finais ruins s\u00e3o chocantes. Talvez n\u00e3o t\u00e3o chocantes quanto Dramatical Murder, por exemplo (creio que n\u00e3o \u00e9 a inten\u00e7\u00e3o chocar TANTO), mas, ainda assim, alguns finais s\u00e3o mais perturbadores que outros. O interessante \u00e9 o jeito que foi escrito, pois, conforme a hist\u00f3ria corria na bad ending, era poss\u00edvel j\u00e1 sentir um clima de tens\u00e3o e o envolvimento com a hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 ainda muito maior; ao final, sente-se aquele aperto na garganta, cujo creio que seja a inten\u00e7\u00e3o de uma bad ending: causar desconforto e ang\u00fastia. Toda a escrita do jogo contribui para, ent\u00e3o, todo o efeito de sentido, nos leva a ter sentimentos que n\u00e3o ter\u00edamos se a hist\u00f3ria fosse escrita de outra maneira (isso n\u00e3o se limita apenas aos finais ruins). \n\nAl\u00e9m disso, ap\u00f3s acabar o final bom da quinta rota (Ukyo), uma s\u00e9rie de light novels s\u00e3o liberadas, cada personagem com sua respectiva light novel. Al\u00e9m disso, temos as mem\u00f3rias, que se passam em dias espec\u00edficos para cada um dos personagens (e estas sim, s\u00e3o visual novel). Por fim, temos tamb\u00e9m os joguinhos. \n\nTudo isso contribui para que haja um jogo completo: uma hist\u00f3ria maravilhosa e bem desenvolvida, com \u00f3timas ilustra\u00e7\u00f5es e \u00f3timos dubladores, al\u00e9m de hist\u00f3rias de apoio, para sustentar ainda mais o romance entre voc\u00ea e o seu escolhido - al\u00e9m do plot em si -, e, pra quebrar o gelo, mini-jogos para se divertir com os personagens. \n\nObviamente, \u00e9 um jogo que cont\u00e9m algumas falhas - mas qual jogo n\u00e3o tem, n\u00e3o \u00e9 mesmo? \u00c9 super recomend\u00e1vel.", "timestamp_created": 1513958160, "timestamp_updated": 1513958160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38536084": {"recommendationid": "38536084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036817726", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514023958}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved this game so much! Easily one of my top Visual Novel games.\n\nGorgeous art and characterization. The background/landscape art is beautiful and uniquely drawn, the BGM as well is fun to listen to and doesn't get tiresome. \n\nThe story is so interesting and the game encourages you to go through every route, which is such a treat in the case of Amnesia because each route is SO different!

I like -most- of the routes (Particularly Kents' and Shins') so far, but one of the routes is just...toxic, as others have stated in their reviews too. Not sure if that's a cultural misunderstanding (is kidnapping/forcible confinement okay in Japanese culture?) but to a western viewer like myself...that was NOT a display of affection or overprotectiveness, that was a display of extreme obsession, selfish manipulation, and disregard for individuality. Aside from the main character being a doormat like Yuna in FFX (for a quick comparison of personality), the art assets, music(the opening theme is fantastic) and the use of color is top-notch. The main outfits for the male characters look laughable, but the other outfits for side characters, and special event scenes look good. The voice acting has some top notch talent, and only Orion comes across as grating at times. thankfully, individual voices can be turned off in the menu opitions. I do like that the game starts out with your character in separate worlds; that you don't start from point A, meet all the guys, then from choices you make, get stuck in a given route with a guy you may not like. For example; Heart World has you as Shin's girlfriend from the start, rather than you picking and choosing between men as you progress based on choices. i still recommend the game; not all of the routes are bad relationships, and no one should look to a fictional heroine as a real-world model for behavior. If you enjoy otome games, and can get over the heroine being a doormat at times,and the aforementioned toxic route, you should derive some enjoyment from the game. it generally goes on sale for $10 or less pretty regularly, so i wouldn't recommend paying full price for it. I would enjoy seeing other games in the lineup (Amnesia Later, etc) get an English translation too. I think Idea Factory and Otomate have done a solid job on bringing games of this type to a western audience within the past 5+ years. I play a fair amount of games in this genre, and i feel like Amnesia: Memories, is legitimately worth the time/money spent if you catch it on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1512852675,

And if you get easily mad at passive, obedient heroines this is definitely NOT for you.\n\nI cannot on good conscience recommend this to anyone. I have to say though that i did not do two of the routes Shin's and the secret one. Why?\nBecause I made Toma's in 3rd place...\n\nThis must have been the first otome i did not fully finish. \nMy 2 problems:\n1) Passive, obedient heroine. She does not have a mind of her own. She's a doll and that's it.\n2) Disturbing, toxic relationships. Sure I guess they wanted to focus on that but this is not the way to do it. If you want to make people see that these are disturbed people you should have a heroine that reacts to it in some matter but she DOESN'T! This is problematic because you might have a susceptible audience that is supposed to be guided by this heroine, to have her as a role model. This is not a good role model and this kind of toxicity shouldn't be approached in a \"oh, poor guy he just suffered so much, that's why he is like this.\" This is very problematic. In real life this could be the beginning of a true horror story that many women are suffering as I write this.\n\nI have no intention of supporting this game but i must thank it for one thing: it has made me realize that many of these otome games have serious problems with portraying toxic people/relationships and that any visual novel creator should have this in consideration when creating their work.", "timestamp_created": 1512780159, "timestamp_updated": 1512852189, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599368", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38144017": {"recommendationid": "38144017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198413397184", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512968501}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game!

All i knew is that in this game your heroine can die in many ways (and btw, all of those deaths are for reason) and that the characters are not what you expect them to be. This turned out to be true and very interesting.\n\nFirst, there are characters I loved and characters I loathed with passion. \n\nAs all otome games, you are able to choose between four guys (in order to unlock the fifth one) to reach all endings. Ofc some may be more tragic than you hope for, but it was really interesting.\n\nThe thing is, it's about your Heroine who got amnesia when spirit Orion accidentally bumped into her when crossing through parallel worlds. Because of it, the heroine has to reconnect with people in order to reclaim her memories on her own, because hospitals would only shun her from people and she would be unable to remember and there would be severe consequences. So, you can chose which world you wanna start with.\n\nShin's route is detective route - you were attacked and you don't know who it was or if it was on purpose. \nIkki's route is more like a tense love x-angle where Ikki's fans are trying to make your life worse and Ikki is trying to protect you from them\nKent's route is so far the most normal of them all: he just wants to figure out what dating means and to throw math puzzles at you (and Ikki)\nToma's route is more of a \"i'll protect you from everything\" route, so if you are looking for extremes... here you go, have him.\nAnd finally, the last person: Ukyo - is the one who is a constant through all routes - after all, in most of them he kills you or just disappears entirely. So what is his reason for doing this? Stay tunned and suffer through all routes to unlock his tragic white haired anime boy story (oops his hair is green though).\n\nFInally, the remaining cast of characters is great. In each route they had few of their characterstics the same, and sometimes it was complete 180 degrees flip (like Rika and Waka). I loved that there were girls in the game like Mine and Sawa and Rika - they were a refreshment. \n\nThe art is gorgeous but the fashion is really disasturous lol.\n\nAnyway, in my opinion this game was worth for Ukyo's, Kent's and Shin's routes. I wasn't fan of Ikki's route and I'll do Toma's route once I am ready to reach for some... extreme in my gaming life.\n\nOverall, not bad and everything is explained in the final route, even the things I thought were unimportant - even though they were kept mentioned in each route (such as the [spoiler]weather problems in august [/spoiler]. \n", "timestamp_created": 1512563325, "timestamp_updated": 1512563325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38092973": {"recommendationid": "38092973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202885474", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515116465}, "language": "english", "review": "<3", "timestamp_created": 1512524672, "timestamp_updated": 1512524672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38050451": {"recommendationid": "38050451", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027550928", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512364398}, "language": "english", "review": "I just...\nI love this game.\nI LOVE this game.\nIt's unexpected, well-written, lovely, great cgs that you don't have to jump through hoops to get (the last 2 you get from beating all 5 in both mini-games), and the mystery is very interesting.\nI am almost embarrassed to talk about how deeply I enjoyed this experience.\nKent <3 also Ikki was pretty great.\nI loved all the stories and the voice acting and just deeply enjoyed the intrigue and mystery to it.\n\n(Spoiler? below)\n... not you Toma................... never you Toma.......", "timestamp_created": 1512365237, "timestamp_updated": 1512365350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38048761": {"recommendationid": "38048761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198375318700", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512257312}, "language": "english", "review": "I haven't played an otome game in years (since Hakuoki on PSP) and honestly this game was super refreshing to play.

I've played many over the years, and a good majority will always have \"that one guy\" who is certifiably nuts and you're better off avoiding-- unless you're into that sort of thing. This game not only has that, but quite a few disturbing elements even in the most innocuous routes. \n\nPros:\n- I love a good twist and the game is full of them. The overarching concept I thought was very interesting. \n- The artwork is fairly stunning. There's some odd proportions on some of the characters but overall all of the eligible male characters are very attractive. The voice acting is also excellent and includes famous ones like Akira Ishida. \n- A long, involved storyline with interesting characters, all of whom have their own motivations. \n\nCons: \n- There were times where it felt as if the heroine's choices were fairly meaningless. If you're someone attempting to get only good endings, I could definitely see how it would be a challenge in this game. This was not a problem for me, as I always try to get 100% of all the endings, so just be aware of that. \n- I mentioned the story is long as a pro, but it could also be a con. The branches feel a bit sprawling for some of them, with some conversations that might not necessarily be relevant and tedious after a while.\n- The heroine herself is a character who has lost her memories (hence the title) and thus in a lot of ways it makes sense that she is fairly \"cookie cutter\". However, I found myself a bit bothered by the fact that this seems to stifle the amount of personality one is able to infer from her.\n- As is often mentioned in other reviews, one of the characters has a very controversial approach that, no matter one's choices, is impossible to avoid. Depending on how squeamish you are, it can be a bit shocking.\n\nOverall I did enjoy this game, but that was because I was looking for something shocking to play and I had an idea of what I'd be getting into. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for standard otome fare, you may find yourself disappointed. If you do like dark dramas, then you may like this a lot.", "timestamp_created": 1512164916, "timestamp_updated": 1512164916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37978239": {"recommendationid": "37978239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405531809", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 868, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1515633804}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6211\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u5feb\u8fdb\uff0c\u597d\u60f3\u54ed", "timestamp_created": 1512140154, "timestamp_updated": 1512140154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37965930": {"recommendationid": "37965930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185625814", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508562008}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Simplemente hermoso, me encanta, un juego muy bien hecho, en especial si te agradan las novelas visuales.\nTe pone en papel de la protagonista y realmente sientes la misma intriga que ella, llena de misterios y sorpresas, aqu\u00ed s\u00ed importan tus decisiones, la personalidad de los chicos var\u00eda de uno a otro, no es una novela visual cualquiera, por algo tuvo tanto \u00e9xito, es una historia bastante interesante, realmente vale la pena comprarlo :)", "timestamp_created": 1512092031, "timestamp_updated": 1512092031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37941035": {"recommendationid": "37941035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115056364", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 91, "last_played": 1516246516}, "language": "english", "review": "fuck", "timestamp_created": 1512000681, "timestamp_updated": 1512000681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37940603": {"recommendationid": "37940603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198447733136", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514853419}, "language": "english", "review": "This.

If you've never read an otome style VN, then this is a fine place to start. I like the game's explanation for the different routes; the game begins with you being lost in between parallel worlds, and your guide, Orion, gives you the choice of which world to enter. The protagonist is a young woman who was in an accident and lost her memories. In Shin's route, it plays out like a murder mystery (without the murder since no one died). On top of trying to piece together the protagonist's lost memories, you are also trying to determine what exactly happened the night of the accident. In the Heart World, Shin is/was your boyfriend before the accident. He's not a bad person, but he's rough around the edges and it isn't unreasonable to be suspicious of him. You make choices through the story about whom you trust, whom you don't trust, and your feelings for different characters all leading to multiple endings in every route.\n\nIf you enjoy visual novels and romance stories, then you can't go wrong, especially when it's only $3.", "timestamp_created": 1511750617, "timestamp_updated": 1511750617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37736771": {"recommendationid": "37736771", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026330759", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 165, "last_played": 1515950857}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me recomendaron este juego.

With this game, there was no contest between quantity and quality; it sacrificed neither, boasting five beautifully made routes with about twenty-six different endings. I got it on sale for about three dollars, but the content is easily worth as much as the usual price asks for.\n\nThe art used in the game is beatifully made, for all of the CGs, backgrounds, and character models. Everything is extremely detailed, and there are over one-hundred images to be collected for the gallery. Even the layout is aesthetically pleasing. The title screens, load screens, and text boxes all share a common theme and are easy on the eyes, unlike those belonging to more flamboyant visual novels. The only aspect of the game that wasn't very visually appealing was the air hockey mini-game, but this flaw is highly insignificant. \n\nThe plots for all routes were very engaging, and wildly different depending on the character of your choosing. The game did not bore, even as I replayed portions of it to achieve all endings. There are many interconnecting factors between the routes that increase the compelling force of the story, and plot twists are executed effortlessly. Character development was an extremely well thought out factor for this game, and made playing it an emotional journey.\n\nIn all, this game is everything you'd want out of a visual novel and more. With an abundance of high-quality content, it is worth every penny.

It's not quite the same story, nor is it complete. So, I was happy to jump into the full version in game form.\n\nWell, after almost 50 hours total, I've gotten all the good endings and several of the others (both bad and normal). I enjoyed every route, even if the character wasn't my usual \"type\". I started with Kent, 'cause I often like the stoic/nerdy type, which pretty much sums him up. He still has plenty of cute, awkward moments, though, and like all the others, he is deeply in love with your character. Next I went with Shin, because I liked his intensity. He's kinda grouchy, sometimes distant, but there's reason behind it. He gets jealous the most often which is a pro to me, heh. Then there's Toma, his competition, who alongside Shin was a childhood friend or brother figure. He plays the indulgent older brother, kind of a foil to Shin's sometimes tough love. But, his protective nature can sometimes make him go too far. Lastly - or so I thought - there's Ikki. I left him for last because I'm not as fond of playboy characters, but in his case, he's an unwilling playboy. And in the end, I loved each of their stories. Plenty of emotional and blush-inducing moments!\n\nThere is a fifth route once you've gotten the four good endings. Ukyo is a mysterious character that shows up here and there in the other routes, and he clearly has feelings for the protagonist, but is for some reason keeping his distance. Finishing his route addresses many of the questions that have cropped up throughout the game - thus, his story is quite different from the others. I liked that there was more to reveal about the world and circumstances in general once you've gotten through the first four routes. He's a fun character as well - probably the most awkward yet affectionate of the bunch.\n\nThe art style worked for me. It's not the most detailed, but every character has their own little flair. The sound is not bad - I quite enjoyed the voice-acting. On the other hand, the music is mostly boring and repetitive. Guess that's pretty common in these kinds of games.\n\nThe tone of the game is about average for otome games, too. Some routes deal with somewhat mundane problems (like choosing between a dream career and love), while others deal with kidnapping or murder. They're all pretty serious and tug on the heartstrings, though. The game doesn't really have gore, but it does describe some brutal events. In all, it's not a particularly dark game, but your character can be killed in each route. She also gets into some slightly...rapey situations. They don't go into detail, but there is talk of \"taking by force\" and such. It didn't go too far for my tastes, but if you don't like that sort of thing...uh, it must be hard to find otome games to play, 'cause they really seem to think girls are into that. Anyway, that stuff is in the minority - mostly the guys are being sweet or protective. Each one has four or five good scenes with a special CG - I could've done with more, but then, can't we always?\n\nIn between such scenes, I did get a little bored sometimes. I think it's a positive that the game isn't terribly long to get through - it doesn't go huge amounts of time between the good bits (the juicy stuff). I mean, who cares that much about seeing a girl trying to relearn her waitressing job? Especially FIVE DIFFERENT TIMES? And of course I didn't have much interest in her female friends, either, but they are still kinda cute and not too, too annoying with their squeaky voices.\n\nNot sure this is worth full price - I got it on sale - but if you have the cash to spare, it could be a pretty good investment of your time, too.", "timestamp_created": 1511080173, "timestamp_updated": 1511080438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36528039": {"recommendationid": "36528039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143148968", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509641243}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Hikayesi di\u011fer otomelere g\u00f6re daha basit olsada, oyun esnas\u0131nda sizi heyecanland\u0131rmas\u0131 muhtemel :D Otome oyunlar\u0131 seviyorsan\u0131z ald\u0131\u011f\u0131n\u0131z her bad endingte \u00e7\u0131ld\u0131rman\u0131z muhtemel.

It's not so easy to find a visual novel so greatly polished.\nThe plot is awesome and there are lots of different endings and routes, it'll take many hours to complete everything for sure. Voice acting (Japanese) and music are great too!\nThere are no forced/stupid endings or plot twists, it's really like a book. All the characters have their personalities and I think that this game had a very long and important phase of study behind it.\nI'd not suggest this to those who are new to visual novels (ok, otome, you won't have me, I'll never be a wapanese sorry ahah), since although here everything goes smooth and there are no flaws at all, it's a long and dramatic story that can bother someone who has never played a visual novel before.\nApart from this, it's really really awesome. Pretty much how a visual novel should be done. Maybe a little too difficult and too long, but it's ok. \nI mean, this game has an Italian wikipedia page long like a novel. I think that I really can't add anything else, it should be famous all over the world :P\nYeah, I think that being an all-around gamer I sound only stupid to those who have passed 20 years in these games while I'm jumping from Yoshi's Island to fps shooters and RPGs made in Vietnam.\nGet this visual novel and play it offline and online for hours ;)", "timestamp_created": 1509737685, "timestamp_updated": 1509737685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615877", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36226891": {"recommendationid": "36226891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134700310", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509855303}, "language": "spanish", "review": "\u00a1Me encanto!.

What I once dismissed as a rom-com genre is happy home to more blood and guts and homicidal maniacs than any FPS or RPG in my experience. Bare bones example of one of the many, many, many, many bad endings my hapless heroine met with: [spoiler]in one playthrough, my story ended with being pushed in front of a car, surviving that to be taken to a hospital, and then that night being snatched from my bed and dropped off the hospital roof to my doom.[/spoiler] \n\nAfter dying many a gruesome death in the name of love, I found myself addicted. Truth be told, I don't really find the \"romances\" in Amnesia romantic, but they're cathartic and the characters are fascinating. Sure, most of the leading men have control issues, and some have serious consent issues, and the plot is frankly a bit thin on the ground, but whether it's just exorcising the worst fears women live with, or if a cypher of a main character is really just a placeholder while, contrary to gender expectations, we identify with \"male\" controlling / angry / possessive desires, there is a great deal of satisfaction to be derived from even the bloodiest of bad endings here. There are emotions taboo and conventional to explore, and those emotions are validated without judgment, even if the validation is a little bit twisted. Simply surviving is a challenging and rewarding puzzle on its own.\n\nThis all sounds bananas, but the game is both bananas and awesome. I laughed, I died, I died some more, I got a good end. I looked up walkthroughs to make sure I got all the good and bad ends. There are many more bad than good ends.  \n\nRecommendation on play order: the game obviously wants you to like Shin and (Secret Route) best, but Ikki is, bizarrely, the least problematic for those who care about consent and respect for bodily autonomy, in my opinion. I'd recommend Ikki/Spade > Kent/Club > Shin/Heart > Toma/Diamond > (Secret Route)/Joker. It's a slow degradation from warped but cute to lots and lots and lots of death (and laughter). \n\nOn a technical note, there are some issues with achievements triggering, but overall? 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1506932276, "timestamp_updated": 1506932276, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.772883", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35394788": {"recommendationid": "35394788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198374234507", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512708565}, "language": "english", "review": "Unlocking all the CGs is tricky and a pain in the ass, but other than that everything's good: Plot, art, mini games, & bgms.

Yes, amnesia is an overdone story gimmick in video games, but here the game is actually built around the amnesia, rather than having it as a convenient way of hiding story elements to the player and make some cheap plot twist. The character has to regain her memories in order to obviously live a normal life, but also to kick a spirit out of her mind (I swear it makes sense... kinda). \n\nWhat is nice is that the five main routes all happen in parallel universes (ok, here's another cliche, but much more used in comics than in video games), but they all connect to each other. Your relationships with the other characters change in the different universes, but if two of them are friends in a universe, they tend to be friends in the others, and to have somewhat similar personalities. The fifth route, where everything is explained, is pretty satisfying. \n\nThe art is very pretty, there are some very cute moments (I took way too many screenshots while playing this game), there is a nice mystery in all of the routes, and the writing, without being outstanding, is good. Plus, there are fun minigames, and I haven't played with the voiceovers for a very long time (it distracts me too much), but it was well done from what I heard. \n\nHowever, there are a few issues. Within a route, there isn't a lot of branching. If you take very different decisions, the few following dialogues will vary, and maybe the ending will be different, but that's it. There are no different scenes other than that. Sure, you can skip the rest of the dialogues, but it still makes replaying a route not that worth it. \n\nThen, between each of the five main routes (especially the first four routes), there's a lot of redundance. You always work at the same place with the same people, one of them as a lot of success with the ladies and has a dangerous group of fans, one of them is a mathematics genius, two are childhood friends, and so on. It's like being served more or less the same VN four times. I would have prefered four shorter stories that are more varied than those long stories that almost don't change. \n\nFinally, speaking of redundancy, Amnesia has a recurrent theme: the borderline abusive boyfriend. Except for one of them (Kent, not the most loving guy, but at least the only decent one), they all have some kind of inappropriate relationship with the protagonist. Switching between the very emotional or melting moments and the ones where they treat you wrongly is a very messed up pattern. In every good ending, I'm mixed in a very bad way. I think \"Well, this is a very happy and lovely moment... if you ignore how badly he treats me the rest of the time, but shhhhh\". I know it's fiction and it's not meant to represent what should be reality, but it's bad that in a dating-sim game, I don't feel invested in the relationships, and even a lot reluctant.", "timestamp_created": 1505284482, "timestamp_updated": 1505284572, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587948", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34894527": {"recommendationid": "34894527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314670457", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504754021}, "language": "english", "review": "While I have yet to finish every route the game has to offer (3/5 routes have been finished), I can say with certainty that this game is worth the buy. Last year, I bought this during the summer sale after learning that it was finally localized. This is one of these Otome games where it's highly reccommended that you play the character routes in a certain order for plot reasons. I didn't know this initially myself but that's what I came to learn after I started on Shin's route. I was glad I started with his route for the very reason that is the route you're supposed to start out with. This is the specific order that I reccommend to go in:\nShin (Heart)\nToma (Diamond)\nKent (Clover)\nIkki (Spade)\n\nThen lastly, Ukyo. That's the route to do last no matter what since in every version except for Android, you have to unlock him by getting the normal endings of each characters. I have seen sites where it's reccommended that you go through Ikki's route 2nd then Toma's route 4th and you can't exactly go wrong with either or. It's very much like Mystic Messenger in this sense when it comes to doing the routes in order.\n\nThe art (done by: Hanamura Mai) is fantastic. There is no doubt that this artist has an abundance of experience under her belt, and ontop of that her style fits in well with the style of story. The colors are very vibrant as well, which adds to the wonderfulness that is Hanamura Mai's art. The voice acting is really good, you have so many amazing seiyus involved in this game that you're pretty much bound to recognize at least one of them or more. Every one of them did an amazing job in bringing the cast of characters to life. I must mention the characterization too is well done, with even fleshing out secondary characters instead of just making them well... side characters!\n\nThere isn't much to say as far as gameplay goes considering this is a visual novel otome first and foremost. Your dialogue options tend to determine what your ending is going to be, and I would say that works well, and is typical of a game like this. I do wish however that there would be more instances where you could have dialogue options. But since the main character has amnesia (not really a spoiler) it's only natural that she would be so quiet.\n\nThe only bad thing I can say is this... While it's better than nothing, this is the only Amnesia game that has been localized so far as of this review. I am hoping that soon maybe, the other games get localized as it would be nice to have every game easily accessible. It wouldn't be such a problem really if I was able to fluently able to speak + understand as well as being able to read Japanese. I'm not sure if this game got very much traction though here which may explain why there hasn't been any confirmation regarding the other games being released outside of Japan.\n\nOverall, an amazing VN and Otome game", "timestamp_created": 1505187885, "timestamp_updated": 1505187885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34885364": {"recommendationid": "34885364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287547494", "num_games_owned": 354, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505532504}, "language": "english", "review": "I died in this otome so I bought Amnesia again as a present for my boyfriend.

Without spoiling I will say that the the way everything is pulled together in the end is beautiful and phenomenal. \n\nShin and Ukyo were my two favorites, with Kent as a close third. Kent's story was moving and touching in a very genuine way. Shin is rough around the edges, but never came across to me like a real jerk, as he respects the heroine's choices first and foremost. He seems cold at first but his character is actually very caring and compassionate, even for the person who ends up being the villain in his storyline. Which makes him the embodiment of the \"Heart\" in the deck of cards, as contradictory as it seemed at first. Ukyo ... without saying too much, his story is the one that made me cry. Dangit. A very ordinary, humble, creative soul grappling with something mindbendingly terrible. Ikki's story I enjoyed though it didn't quite get up to love for me. I can't stand Toma, though I know others enjoyed him. I can empathize with the issues he was dealing with but he would have had to be incredibly more proactive about them to be a convincing love interest imo. Then again, maybe you have to get one bad apple in the bunch and that was the point. Idk. \n\nThe art is lovely, immensely appealing to look at. I loved the side characters who all felt very distinctive and memorable. That made the world feel realer and more enjoyable even when you're not with your love interest. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1505141016, "timestamp_updated": 1505141016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34881479": {"recommendationid": "34881479", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321900428", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483615680}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6ca1\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\u5b57\u5e55\u54e6", "timestamp_created": 1505131580, "timestamp_updated": 1505131580, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.412935", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34758365": {"recommendationid": "34758365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245422544", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503418292}, "language": "english", "review": "my boyfriend calls me a weaboo because i played this game but i don't care because i totally loved it.  10/10 if there's a sequel someone better tell me bc i'm all for it", "timestamp_created": 1504624029, "timestamp_updated": 1504624029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34719851": {"recommendationid": "34719851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200024139", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 3226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513452546}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful game with wonderful story lines.", "timestamp_created": 1504467189, "timestamp_updated": 1511384617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34713453": {"recommendationid": "34713453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053481505", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504297029}, "language": "french", "review": "Vous interpr\u00e9tez une jeune fille amn\u00e9sique qui cherche \u00e0 recouvrer ses souvenirs \u00e0 travers des rencontres et dialogues. \nPlusieurs \"mondes\" sont possibles et chaque monde poss\u00e8de plusieurs fins alternatives.

I ended up getting caught by the otome game world's cruel claws *being dramatic*. It is true in some sense because I couldn't stop myself playing it. And I ended up buying it, I didn't even wait for sale. In my opinion, it's worth every penny! \n\nI was so curious with what's going to happen with the next choice or character. It is a very well written visual novel. Characters have some depths and are not some shallow love interests. Developer did very good job on that. Every character has some reason behind why they decided to act that way, some more convincing than others but still ok. And what's the most amazing thing for me is that the story is consistent in every possible character. It doesn't matter who you choose as your love interest other love interest that haven't chosen have the traits. It really gives parallel universe feeling, like you're exploring what could have been in other universe. And it was this kept me in this game.  \n\nThe game start with the introduction of Orion, a spirit. By some unknown reason that you are not going to learn until you unlock last character, Orion trapped inside you and it caused you to lost your memories. He is your guide during the game. And by his suggestion, you're entering different parallel universes that can be the universe you're coming from on equal chances. \n\nIn this game, you have five love interests. You're choosing one of them when choose your \"world\". As soon as you choose the character, every choice you make lead you one of the good, bad, and normal endings. Every character has one good ending and can be intriguing to get. Luckily, there are plenty of walkthroughs on the internet. I happened to always get normal or bad ending on my own. Apart from that, every love interest has several normal and bad endings. Some bad endings can be shocking. I sometimes said \"no way!\" and it can be creepy. But it is just a game, isn't it?! \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game even if you never played otome before. It is story rich and it is not some game that you make every obvious decisions to end the game and get the guy.

If so, then this game is for you. I have only played against 2 of the 5 datable characters so far. One is pretty much a rapist. One glance at his eyes makes anyone want to sleep with him. This is true even of your best friend who knows he is your boyfriend. Basically he is drugging them into having sex with him. The only exception is you, which is his reason for dating you. Another is emotionless and doesn't understand why he should even want to wish you good morning. He is only interested in numbers and treats you horribly. I know one of the remaining 3 guys is a literal loony. He tries to kill you when you are dating other guys. The game is a dating sim with creeps. I expected with the 'regaining your memories' that the girl would actually have a life worth regaining. Instead she has maybe 1 friend and a job plus no contact with her family.

Anw, Playing a visual novel on PC/Laptop does give a person who've spent time on portable device a new sense of experience. Not only the art quality, the chance to see your husbando(s) on a large screen is... basicly better, not to mention that Amnesia itself has reached people from all around the community since many Otome titles are being translated to English now.\n\nAs a oldie of this game, I love the experience and it did brought back \"memories\" :lol: If you've played this game before on PSP, it won't be a bad idea to revisit it. I mean, heck, this game was on the sale list, so why not? Voice lines for CGs, English-translated plus some new contents. So... why not? :v Well, I'm writting this review when the sale was closed already, so yeah, wait for another chance then.\n\nAnd for new people who haven't play this game before. If you're familiar with otome game, then try this game ( it'll be weird if you haven't touched this game tho... ) it was and still good for newbies. If you haven't played otome game before, try it, it's a new experience, calls \"visual novels\" not for show y' know. \n\nStill, grab it when it's sale only.

I bought it during the steam winter sale and did one route, but I didn't pick it up again until this summer. I don't regret it at all. The artwork is very well done and is appealing to the eye.\nEach path you choose is different from one another, and I personally found all routes intruiging. The guys in this game aren't necessarily the best with some of their personalities. (Not the worst by any means, though!) The route order you choose to do doesn't matter all that much, but I would strongly advise you to save the Diamond route for last, as for the overall tone of the game takes a dark turn. The \"true\" route tied up the game very nicely!\nOrion was a very entertaining companion throughtout the entire game, but for some his incessant babbling may become annoying.\nThe MC: As a lot of people have mentioned, the MC really doesn't have much of a personality. If you want a MC with a personality, this game mignt not be for you.\nOverall, Amnesia: Memories is an excellent game for all otome lovers. The characters are certaintly memorable and there is a lot of content on this game. (The mini games and side stories). This game tends to be on sale quite frequently for a superb price, so if you don't want to pay full price, the sales would be an amazing opportunity to obtain this game!

This review was written after completing every route and achievement in the game. This game gets a 10/10 from me.\n\nIf you are a fan of visual novels or otome games, this game is definitely one you should consider buying! Futhermore, it often goes on sale for ~$2 which is definitely a steal. Keep a lookout for this game during sales!\n\nFirstly, this game has gorgeous art. I know art shouldn't be the main factor in a VN but it is a huge plus! There are five love interests you can romance, and each love interest has more than one ending. The personalities of the guys also varies so you should more than likely be able to find a favourite. Their routes branch out quite a bit as well, so you wouldn't feel like you are repeating the same storyline for a different character. The personalities of your friends and other extra characters changes depending on your route, which brought about a certain kind of freshness. Saving, loading and skipping functions were bug-free and worked well - which is essential if you are planning to complete all routes.\n\nAlthough some parts were pretty cheesy and cringe (quite common in otome games though), I truly enjoyed playing through this game. There were many surprises and I even teared at some of the scenes... especially at the true ending. However, the MC doesn't really have a character of her own (except in one of the routes) and she is very passive, often letting Orion voice her thoughts for you. This is due to her amnesia. Honestly, this caused me to be quite irritated at her at some points in the game. Some of the routes (especially the bad endings) may be quite triggering too.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game, especially when it's on sale. My favourite routes are Kent and Ukyo, and I did enjoy all five main routes so I hope you would too.", "timestamp_created": 1499262459, "timestamp_updated": 1499446453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581380", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33275246": {"recommendationid": "33275246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110141196", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481466046}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10\n\nkent is my love\n\n[spoiler]I would let toma kill me again[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1499261823, "timestamp_updated": 1499261849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33258857": {"recommendationid": "33258857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198238303474", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498968635}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me preface this review by saying that I've played visual novels like Hakuoki and Code: Realize (and XBlaze Code: Embryo, though it has some of the same faults as this) so I might be a little spoiled in my VN expectations.\n\nI have the game on Steam but have been playing it on my Vita. I've played through two routes in the past couple of days in order to get a decent enough feel of it for a review. I played through Ikki's/Spade World first just as random selection, and then through Shin's/Heart. You aren't introduced to the characters at all before you pick, but I had seen some screen shots beforehand to know names/faces.\n\nThis really shouldn't be spoilery. I'm not going into any plot points.\n\nPROS:\n\n--You're not determining the love interest based on choices in the first 5 chapters or so, like I'm used to. After the brief intro/prologue, you pick a route based on a card suit, and that determines the love interest and story. This is a plus in the sense that you don't have to read several chapters that are 98% similar to the other routes each time.\n\n--The stories themselves aren't nearly as long as what I'm used to. Generally, I would prefer longer, fleshed out stories, but dragging these stories out would probably just get tiring. The length suits them because so far they seem to just be \"slice of life\" and nothing super involved.\n\n--The characters aren't the same personality dropped into a bunch of different skins. You have your playboy type, childhood friend(s), some mystery dude, math nerd, mean girl, etc. They're tropes, sure, but at least you can tell them all apart by personality, actions, etc. They're interesting and colorful. \n\nCONS:\n\n--The MC is like, nonexistent. I guess it was an attempt at making the player feel like they're her, but it just ended up making everyone talk in these extended monologues and wasn't AT ALL immersive. Someone is talking to her and her only responses are when you're prompted to make a choice, but that's usually while they've said a million things that you'd expect her to respond to so that it actually feels like a conversation. Toward the end of both routes, she had actual dialogue, but that's after going through the whole story with the spirit in her head saying things like, \"You're really tired,\" or otherwise voicing her feelings aloud as if she's incapable. She lost her memories, she's not a vegetable. \n\n--Tying into the last one...there's no real narration. Other than the spirit's comments about what's happening or on the day's events, there's no narrator describing the surroundings or otherwise doing any world-building. It made the stories a little flat for me. All dialogue and no \"I went to work the next day, nervous about blah blah blah.\" The characters are obviously the main focus in the art, but they're not really deep enough for the game to simply be character-driven.\n\n\nHALF PRO/HALF CON:\n--The character art is pretty, as expected from otomate. They're expressive, beautifully-colored, and the outfits are interesting. The backgrounds are detailed enough drawings, but then they're just monochrome watercolor-splashed, so they're all pretty muted and not very immersive. Again, this could be because they wanted to focus on characters, but...see above.\n\n--Not a whole lot happened in Ikki's route, but Shin's was kind of a mystery investigation. They're totally different stories, which I liked (going back to what I said about not having to play half of the story in order to choose the love interest). Just about all of the characters are present in each, but they play somewhat different roles.\n\nAll of that being said, I'm definitely going to read through the other routes, but the experience hasn't been nearly what I expected. I was used to the lively narration of both Code: Realize and Hakuoki, in which the narrator actually had dialogue and told a story in between interactions with other characters. It was hard to really feel anything for this MC because it was like she wasn't even there until a CG popped up.\n\nIf you go into it expecting a casual VN that will be entertaining enough but not super immersive, then go for it, especially while it's on sale. The focus seems to be on characters, not backgrounds or deep plots that take several hours to read through. I don't dislike the game, but I have certainly played better VNs.", "timestamp_created": 1499226010, "timestamp_updated": 1499309142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33251982": {"recommendationid": "33251982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198399433348", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509530378}, "language": "english", "review": "This is actually my favorite otome game, and the one that made me an otome fan.

I don't reccommend doing Toma first, as it will completely turn you off from the game. Do them in the order the worlds appear. Heart, Spade, Clover, Diamond, and then Joker once you unlock it.\n\nThe art quality is fantastic, despite everyones very....um...odd choices of fashion. The artist really REALLY loves belt buckles. The only thing I didn't like about the art is the ridiculous stunned bunny look the MC always has on her face. Compared to the guys, she's always an expresionless doll. She doesn't really have any personality, for obvious reasons, but I was fine with that, as at least she's not dumb as a doorknob with no common sense like the MC in OZMAFIA!! so I was able to skim past her flaws. Orion more than makes up for her.\n\nI knew going into it, that there was going to be a lot of messed up stuff, and that one of the characters is a hardcore yandere. I ended up taking a screenshot every time someone he said raised a red flag, and I made a game of it to make it a bit more lighthearted. By the 15th day, I had over 70 screenshots. I ended up just giving up, since I didn't want a thousand more screenshots.\n\nFrom best to worst, my characters would be-\nUkyo + Orion cuz he's B E S T B O Y E\nIkki\nKent\nShin\nToma\n\nToma is well...Toma...It's funny, if I didn't know information about the game before hand, Toma would have been my first route. The sweet, scincere, protective childhood friend. *snorts*.  Toma's good ending is \"um....\" Toma's normal ending is \"um....\" Toma's two bad endings are \"um....\"\n\nShin's romance was meh. I was more interested in the actual murder mystery who-dunint than anything else. Not much else to say, really. I don't like tsunderes, they remind me of a child still stuck in the 'pulling the hair of the girl you like' stage. Shin's good ending is \"That's it?\". Shin's normal ending is \"Meh\" but Shin's two bad endings? They give you the true taste of what is to come in the game, and they are great. Which is why I reccomend doing him first.\n\nKent is the cyborg learning emotions for the first time. It's endearing most of the time, but can get kind of cringy at times. His good ending was very sweet. Normal end is kind of bittersweet, while I haven't bothered to do his bad ends yet.\n\nIkki was a surprise. I knew he was the playboy type character which I always loathe, but once you get into his route more, he's one of those \"surounded and 'loved' by everyone but still lonely\" characters, which I always end up being a sucker for. I enjoyed his route a lot. I figured he'd be my top guy at the end, but Ukyo came out of left field and shoved everyone else off the pedestal. Good end is just great. His three bad ends are great as well. \n\nFinally is Ukyo. Ukyo, Ukyo, Ukyo. He is locked at the beginning of the game. You need to obtain the good ending with the four other characters to unlock him, but honestly it's so worth suffering through Toma route for him. During all the other guys, you'll get bits and peices that will make you very curious as to who this guy is. This shit is the true ending. I haven't done his normal or his SEVEN BAD ENDS (SEVEN!!!) but his good ending...*muwah* it's a masterpeice. Ties everything together, and it's just fantastic. \n\nIt's on sale for $3.29CAD right now, no reason not to buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1498856189, "timestamp_updated": 1498856189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33027681": {"recommendationid": "33027681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281315344", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498812856}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "top devo ser o unico homi cabra macho com coragem que gosto", "timestamp_created": 1498809177, "timestamp_updated": 1498809177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501685", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33010066": {"recommendationid": "33010066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051246620", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498482853}, "language": "english", "review": "Money well spent :)", "timestamp_created": 1498770208, "timestamp_updated": 1498770208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597888", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33009463": {"recommendationid": "33009463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035262345", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462596757}, "language": "english", "review": "otome game nice 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1498769208, "timestamp_updated": 1498769208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499198", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33008282": {"recommendationid": "33008282", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124054127", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491824483}, "language": "english", "review": "good game but can become boring after a while so 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1498767415, "timestamp_updated": 1498767415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499198", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33001372": {"recommendationid": "33001372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139659456", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476845752}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoy this game, but it is quite slow.

It has beautiful artwork, unique characters, voice acting, lots of choices, numerous endings, and a deep well-written story. Each route can feel like they drag on for a bit but as this isn't free, I appreciated the amount of content. The characters are all extremely well-written and are easily recognizable from one another both physically and personality-wise.

It seems that\u2019s true of a lot of people who bought it. First of all, I really enjoyed it, however, it is a fairly dark game and people who are easily bothered by such things should be careful. There is a lot of death and many instances of possibly upsetting implications made by the guys. The diamond world is especially upsetting. The characters are all pretty sexist, too.\nWith that warning done, I had a lot of fun playing this game. Even having watched the anime, there were still things that I found surprising. Kent and Shin's stories where hardly covered at all in the anime so those routes were mostly surprising. Ikki's route was not fully covered, either. Because of the way that the anime tried to show all of the different worlds, some aspects are different as well. I think the game is still worth it to play even after having seen the anime. If you haven't seen the anime then it's probably even more worthwhile, assuming you like this type of dark story. Additionally: I very much do not like romance stories and have no interest in that type of thign. It was the story that I found enjoyable.\nIn regards to the mechanics, there is A Lot of reading. This type of game is called a visual Novel for a reason. A single route, unless you die early, takes several hours to get through. The only other dating sim I've ever played is mystic messenger which gives significantly more freedom for decision making than Amnesia does. The decisions that cause the most variation in plot are the ones that get you killed.

To be fair, her passiveness does actually have a plot reason, unlike a lot of other MCs, but that doesn't help your urge to shake her to see if you can hear her brain rattle. Her dazed baby bunny impression just highlights how crazytoons everything else is. Characters are walking tropes dialed up to 11, dressed like renaissance fair addicts who got stranded naked one night in a Hot Topic and had to make do. The story and romances are often plodding, but just as you're nodding off to sleep you'll hit a wrong option and see the bland love story twist and end horribly in a variety of entertaining ways. \n\nFor best effect and an exponential increase in the WTF factor, go through in order of line-up: Start with the verbally and emotionally abusive childhood friend; then the playboy with the supernatural roofie ability; continue on with Borg unit 3 of 5; then the other childhood friend, the sweet, sincere one - oh yeah, definitely go out with that guy. What a keeper! And once you've survived all those yahoos, you unlock the Mystery Dude. IT PUTS THE LOTION ON ITS SKIN! \n\nSome parts are boring and some are cringeworthy, and a lotta people will find this downright disturbing, but overall I had just as much fun playing this VN as many others, though probably not in the way the creators of this game intended. \n\n(To be fair, Mystery Dude's story actually turned out to be a bit of a page turner dovetailing neatly back into the other four stories, with the dark humor - or tragic angst if that's how you read it - hitting its apogee, and it actually improved my overall impression of the whole as an actual game rather than a five car pile-up.

Some of them even outright kill the MC, depending on how much she tolerates abuse.[/spoiler] As others have said the MC is VERY passive, and disturbingly calm about the men in her life man-handling her and even [spoiler] threatening/implying they might r@pe her [/spoiler] at various points in the playthrough. [spoiler] One character even impirsions the MC in a dog cage for a length of time. And no, it's not kinky. Just scary. [/spoiler] The last, unlockable route is definetly the best in the game, but it still has its problems, and that's if you can get through all of the dialouge. And hoo boy, there is [i] a lot of it.[/i] It feels like The first or second draft, because a lot of the chatter you get from Orion is extremely redundant. This kid never shuts up, at all. I enjoy visual novels and paperback novels alike, but there is  only so much redundancy I can tolerate before I start skimming or turning on the skip button.\n\nPRODUCTION VALUES: Top notch. Beautiful graphics, lovely music, talented voice actors (it's all in Japanese though, no English dubbing). It's a shame the people behind these elements of the game didn't find something with a better story to work on. \n\nGAMEPLAY: Very little actual choices to be made here, sadly. And when you do get choices, a lot of times they either don't actually matter, are trial and error, or just don't make sense. I remember at least one choice is you can pick between something along the lines of \"...\" OR \".....\" Brilliant. \n\n\nIn closing, unless you're looking for something to read while looking at pretty graphics and you don't mind reading about a horrificly dull and boring girl getting abused at every step, I'd look elsewhere for a dating sim or VN.

Ich war zu beginn recht kritisch ob ich mir dieses Spiel holen soll, da ich noch nie ein otome/visual novel gespielt habe. Und da ich keinen sale oder so was erwischt habe, war es ja auch ne ganze menge Geld.... aber im Nachhinein bin ich froh es getan zu haben. Ich habe das Spiel jetzt einmal komplett durch, oder sagen wir besser ich habe f\u00fcr alle Charaktere das bestm\u00f6gliche Ende erspielt. Da ich noch kein schlechtes oder normales Ende gesehen habe kann ich dar\u00fcber jetzt nichts sagen, aber was ich an enden kenne gef\u00e4llt mir sehr. Aber gehen wir der Reihe nach. \n\nZuerst mal der Zeichenstiel: der hat mir wirklich sehr gefallen. Die Hintergr\u00fcnde waren einfach, aber gut, die Charaktere daf\u00fcr umso besser, unterschiedliches aussehen, viele verschiedene K\u00f6rperhaltungen, kurz um: sehr sch\u00f6n anzusehen.\n\nStimmen: also das ist etwas, das ich, als jemand der von solchen spielen bis dato keine Ahnung hatte, nicht erwartet hatte... alle Charaktere haben ihren Text auf japanisch gesprochen, was mir wirklich sehr gefallen hat. Die m\u00e4nnlichen Stimmen wahren...naja wie soll ich sagen...\u201clecker\u201c...kann man das so sagen? Ich denke mal das passt so ;)\n\ndann zur Musik: die Hintergrundmusik war simpel aber sch\u00f6n. Die meiste zeit war es die selbe, was aber nicht gest\u00f6rt hat. Je nach Situation und darin vorhandenen Gef\u00fchlen ver\u00e4nderte sie sich und unterstreicht das Gesamtbild perfekt. Die Musik war nie st\u00f6rend oder wirkte deplatziert, ebenso war sie nie langweilig.\n\nKommen wir zu einem sehr interessanten Punkt, der Vielfalt: \nA) wie gesagt, ich hab vorher nie so ein Spiel gehabt, meine \u00fcblichen spielen entsprechen eher OpenWorld, sandbox, survival, fantasy und RPG, weshalb ich mit keinen gro\u00dfen Erwartungen an Handlungsfreiheit oder spielerische Vielfalt/Freiheit an das hier herangegangen bin. Wie erwartet hat man nur sehr eingeschenkte M\u00f6glichkeiten. Aber: nur wenn man auf ein bestimmtes Ende hinarbeitet. Ich hatte von Anfang an zum Ziel alle Welten beim ersten Anlauf mit dem bestm\u00f6glichen Ende abzuschlie\u00dfen. Und dementsprechend habe ich auch meine Antworten gew\u00e4hlt. Tut man das allerdings nicht, gibt es eine doch recht hohe Vielfalt was die Entwicklung und deine Beziehung zu dem jeweiligen Hauptcharakter angeht. Nebencharaktere kann man jedoch kaum beeinflussen. Jedoch alles in allen mehr und besser als ich erwartet habe, es gab durchaus Momente in denen ich sehr genau bzw lange \u00fcberlegen musste welche Antwort \u201erichtig\u201c ist.\nB) die Vielfalt der Charaktere/Geschichten ist ausgewogen. Prinzipiell hat man hier folgende Geschichten zu erleben: Kindheitsfreund wird zum geliebten, M\u00e4dchen angelt sich Idol, bzw beliebtesten Typen der Stadt, M\u00e4dchen erobert unnarrbarens Mathe -genie bzw rationalisten, Kindheitsfreund wird zum geliebten Version 2, und schlie\u00dflich die Trag\u00f6die mit dem \u201eSeelenverwandten\u201c... klingt erstmals nach nichts besonderem, allem schon dagewesenem, und so ist es auch. Aber trotz allem wurden die einzelnen Charaktere und Situationen extrem gut umgesetzt, so dass keine der Geschichten langweilig oder (auf unangenehme weise) vorhersehbar war. Tats\u00e4chlich gab es viele Stellen die mich sehr positiv \u00fcberrascht haben, haupts\u00e4chlich in Form von lustigen Momenten. Die zu erobernden Jungs hatten alle sehr sch\u00f6ne, verschiedene Eigenschaften und erstaunlich genaue Hintergrundgeschichten.

The writing is decent majority of the time; there are some hiccups with it but I would go as far as to forgive the VN for those as it can be enjoyed even despite said hiccups. The length feels appropriate as well. Overall I have a positive opinion of the VN and so my negative points about this game are nitpicks more than anything.\n\nIn addition to those I've mentioned above, there's something that is a personal con for me \u2013 this VN allows you to name your protagonist. It's just a matter of preferences and thus I didn't include it on the list above, but I still have to note that being able to choose a name in games that have full voice acting just seems weird choice regarless; it results in some awkward moments when the characters are supposed to be saying the protagonist's name. \n\nThe premise for the story \u2013 a heroine suffering from amnesia \u2013 is undoubtedly a clich\u00e9, but it's a clich\u00e9 that works because of how it was presented. It was interesting that in this VN your companion was set based on the world you chose to enter rather than your choices in interacting with all of them. This made it much more rewarding to replay the game because every character's world/route was distinctive and altogether a new experience. If you are looking at the selection of dateable characters and already have someone in mind, then I recommend looking up which one belongs to which world. \n\nI've never researched a visual novel to determine choices or routes before playing it. I'm the type who likes to first play it by hand, picking choices that would be closest to ones I'd pick in real life rather than with the intention of reaching a good ending. That tactic usually brings some interesting results and this VN was no exception. I'm going to talk about the worlds/characters in the order I cleared them. Vague spoilers will follow!\n\n[b]Toma:[/b] Ending I got first: BAD [spoiler](We\u2019ll be together forever (Toma-centric))[/spoiler]\nI ended up on his route by pure accident, but was pleased since he looked like an interesting character. However, I very quickly begun to have a different vibe from him, downright menacing from the way he acted and talked. It really doesn't help that he never seems sure what he feels, and even his good ending isn't all that good for anyone involved \u2013 himself included. If this visual novel had you end up with a partner based on your decisions, then I'd whole-heartedly expect him to be the representative of a bad ending. I think Toma and his good route could have been really, really interesting if the writing had been handled differently. His good route is where the writing of this game really limped around, but I suppose there's still some appeal in it regardless. \n\n[b]Kent:[/b] Ending I got first: NORMAL [spoiler](I want to see you)[/spoiler]\nI found Kent to be really interesting character because of his apparent level-headedness, stoic demeanor, and general attitude. The writing worked well in all of his routes and kept him in character; it really did feel like your choices as a player were the only things affecting the ending as Kent seemed to be reacting accordingly to everything you did. The Kent related bad ending wasn't bad because of Kent and he did nothing wrong in that, while the Ukyo related bad ending wasn't his fault either. I personally found the Normal ending to be the best one, because it was the most realistic and not as syrup sweet as the Good ending.\n\n[b]Ikki:[/b] Ending I got first: BAD [spoiler](I wanted us to live together)[/spoiler]\nThis was by far the most tedious route to play and I was already fed up with Ikki during the first week with him. I tried to see what his appeal would be but failed to find any, and thus getting a bad ending didn't come as a surprise. The humorous part was that the bad ending I landed on seemed like a good ending for the protagonist! However, the writing for Ikki's routes was decent and consistent with his character no matter which ending you landed on so I have commend the world for that reason. In addition some of the writing of the supporting characters was very entertaining!\n\n[b]Shin:[/b] Ending I got first: NORMAL [spoiler](I will steal you away)[/spoiler]\nI was rather looking forward to his world after his appearances in the other worlds had made Shin seem like a fun character. His route was more of a mystery solving adventure than romantic one, which was a strange choice compared to the previous ones. Writing was consistent but the route brought no surprises, so in that regard you might consider it somewhat of a failure. The good ending in this world was the most realistic one of all worlds. \n\n[b]Ukyo:[/b] Ending I got first: BAD [spoiler](Can you take tomorrow off work?)[/spoiler]\nAdmittedly I was highly skeptical when starting this, because of his appearances in other characters worlds. However I quickly found myself intrigued by Ukyo's personality and wanted to find out what his deal was. While the big reveal about him wasn't surprising, I still found it to be written decently and have to consider the good ending from his world as the true ending for the visual novel. \n\nIn conclusion, when only looking at the writing of each world and their routes (and ignoring my personal bias for characters) I'd say that the best to worst written worlds are as follows:\nKent \u2192 Ukyo \u2192 Ikki \u2192 Shin \u2192 Toma", "timestamp_created": 1493553323, "timestamp_updated": 1493553323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640621", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31454085": {"recommendationid": "31454085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106330489", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461136430}, "language": "english", "review": "The most high-quality, well-produced visual novel I've ever played.

I enjoyed the game and its production value a lot.\n\nThat being said, this is also the most f***ed up visual novel I've ever played.

Vorallem das Voice Akting hat mir gut gefallen *_*!\nMeine erste route war Diamond.... was evtl nicht die beste entscheidung gewesen ist aber ich bin dennoch froh dar\u00fcber dass ich es getan habe. Meine vermutung war, dass es eines dieser typischen girly games wird wo es sich nur um wundervolle zeiten handelt nur dass man unterschiedliche \"lover\" w\u00e4hlen kann. Wie es sich herrausgestellt hat... falsch gedacht. Es geht in den ersten geschichten tats\u00e4chlich ziemlich hart zur sache. Jede deiner entscheidungen bestimmt ob du stibst, dein lover stirbt, ihr \u00fcberlebt usw. . Es ist so dramatisch und gleichzeitig schwer den richtigen weg zu einem Happy End zu finden, dass man sich in diesem spiel richtig hart verlieren kann. Nachdem man die ersten 4 Welten durchgespielt hat er\u00f6ffnet sich ein neuer part... der meiner meinung nach der beste von allen ist. Ich habe bei diesem spiel so oft geweint weil es mir einfach so gut gefallen hat... . Jede Welt hat ein Ziemlich \u00fcberraschendes Ende und es wird nie langweilig wenn man alle sehen will (Es gibt 5 Happy ends, 5 Normale endings und dutzend schlechter die einfach nur zu empfehlen sind).\n\nZu sagen ist jedoch, dass dieses spiel sich evtl nicht so f\u00fcr die M\u00e4nnlichen Gesch\u00f6pfe unter uns eignet, die keinen kitschigen oder \u00fcberheblichen romanzen vertragen. Auch f\u00fcr Kinder ist es nicht zu empfehlen, weil es in manchen Situationen pervers wird. Aber der Mind-Fuck factor ist bei diesem Visual Novel definitiv gegeben.

While I recommend it, I don't have any strong feelings about A:M which was enjoyable, but felt superficial to me despite the length.\n\nThe voice acting is stellar and a pleasure to listen to. The OST is nice and I only muted it in the last routes, when I wanted to listen to my own music.\nThe CGs are beautiful and many have additional voicelines that can be triggered in the album by clicking over them. A nice touch!\nThe character design is... questionable. Almost everybody looks like a fashion monster, with Kent and his belt covered arm as worst offender in my book. The male characters suffer from abnormally elongated limbs and yaoi hands, with their noodle fingers being really distracting.\nThe backgrounds look like photos heavily filtered. While consistent, they are generic, dull and look lazy, and the only reason I'm mentioning them is that this is not your average indie VN, this is an Otomate product.\n\nThe personalities and general relationships among the characters stay the same across all routes, but the plot is vastly different. Completing the first 4 available routes opens up a 5th in which the overarching plot is explained.\nMC deserves a couple of lines. She is so pretty! Her design made me really happy... and yet. She loses, on top of her memories, her personality as well. Orion serves as main narrator, and while he is cute and funny, it makes me seriously wonder what the fuck do these guys find in someone who stays silent for 95% of the time and only asks questions. She was so not present that most of the game is either a Orion monologue or a love interest monologue. \nThe bad endings are many and extremely easy to meet. You definitely need guides for good and normal routes. Choices matter and there are a lot, yet the system is so intricated that following a guide takes out the fun of actually choosing.\nA short description of the guys and my feels about their routes (I hid the most spoilery bits just in case):\n[list][*]Shin is blunt, protective of MC and could be defined a light tsundere. His route deals mostly with mystery solving. I found him one of the most positive characters overall. His route was interesting, and his personality and care for MC's wellbeing is consistent in all routes. With that said, his bluntness is quick to become verbal abuse. If MC had a personality she could have snapped back, but she drank up his insults like water. My favorite overall.\n[*]Ikki's cheeerful flirtatiousness is caused by his eyes, which have the power to seduce everyone who looks into them. He has a fan club of obsessed girls that serve as antagonist in almost all routes. His aphrodisiac eyes don't work on MC, of course. While he's pretty cute, he's also indecisive and so starved for praise that he enables the fan club's toxicity. His friendship with Kent is amusing, but I found his character shallow and pretty stupid [spoiler](the three months rule smh)[/spoiler].\n[*]Kent is often regarded as the game's teddy bear, but I couldn't stand him. He's overanalytic, academically dissects cost/benefit of every action and is socially oblivious. While he mellows out, I found him frustrating and painful to read because of such extreme characterization. [spoiler]No, I do not think that delaying your achievements to go visit the girl you've been dating for 1 month is romantic. I also do not think that talking about marriage after said month is cute. But I'm a disillusioned adult\u2122.[/spoiler]\n[*]Toma is the overprotective childhood friend who decided to take on the role of the big brother. He's also a pretty mellow yandere. Many consider his route shocking, and I was promised extremes such as what Harada/Paraiso writes... yet in the end he's a goody two shoes. [spoiler]When he mentioned the harrassment being his own doing, I was actually impressed. I was hoping it would be true. Instead, he just wanted to protect MC from the real threat of the fan club, had good intentions and was actually working to frame the fan club all along (in his twisted way). It made me feel very meh regarding the good ending, and I actually liked his bad ending more. The CG reminds me of DMMd Clear's bad end, in all its tragic, perverted glory.[/spoiler]\n[*]Once you unlock all the good endings for the first 4 guys, you can select [spoiler]Ukyo[/spoiler], which popped up in all the other routes. Based on his previous appearances and his vague dialogue, I had already guessed that he was [spoiler]a discount Homura from MadoMagica[/spoiler]. His route was a maze to navigate, but paradoxically the one in which MC had most agency and personality gain (despite the utterly stupid choices and poor tastes). Again, I felt meh about him, and can't really understand his appeal [spoiler](Toma at least had the whole yandere thing going on, but with Ukyo it's straight murder)[/spoiler]. He goes from protective, caring yet torn by [spoiler]the distance he needs to keep[/spoiler] to [spoiler]serial killer[/spoiler] whenever the plot needs him to.\n[*]The supporting cast deserves a shoutout. Orion is a nice narrator; Sawa is a undeveloped but loyal friend; despite her rivalry with MC, Mine has mini redemption-arcs that make me like her; the manager has the most drastic personality changes and it becomes pretty funny; Rika is generally meh but gets bearable in the fifth route.\n[/list]\nI expected more from this apparently dark and twisted otome, but I guess the MC's amnesia and loss of personality limit how far things go. Maybe I'm too hooked on smut mobage ports, but the lack of intimacy irked me. They're in college ffs, yet we only have hugs, kisses... and a marriage proposal after those. Yeah, right. It's a PEGI 12 so I shouldn't have expected much, but again it feels like a missed opportunity to really explore the full potential of the characters.\nI might have sounded overly negative, but I'm just disappointed in the wasted possibilities. It's a good otome and a good VN overall, but MC really limited my enjoyement of it and made many situations, especially the romances, unbelievable. Ultimately the darkness felt superficial because of the goody two shoes natures of even the characters who are supposed to be twisted. \nDespite my status of desensitized disillusioned adult\u2122, some stuff might make readers uncomfortable, especially the younger ones (this is a PEGI 12 after all...), so approach with care.", "timestamp_created": 1493341233, "timestamp_updated": 1493386112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537869", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31389674": {"recommendationid": "31389674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057726297", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9397, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509068058}, "language": "english", "review": "This game broke my life.", "timestamp_created": 1493282537, "timestamp_updated": 1493282537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532192", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31383957": {"recommendationid": "31383957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294991558", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510722490}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u60f3\u8981\u8ffd\u6c42\u5965\u5229\u5965\u5c0f\u5929\u4f7f\uff01\uff01\uff01\u4ed6\u592a\u53ef\u7231\u4e86\u2026\u2026\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7a7f\u5973\u4ec6\u88c5\u7684\u6837\u5b50\u2026\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1493246019, "timestamp_updated": 1493246019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509312", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31351687": {"recommendationid": "31351687", "author": {"steamid": "76561198366507294", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513821124}, "language": "english", "review": "I always like playing an otome where the general story is different in each path, and I was not disappointed with Amnesia: Memories on this aspect. Beware of marked and unmarked spoilers ahead.\n\nFirst, I want to talk about the guys and Orion, starting with Orion and Toma. Orion could be incredibly overbearing at times. Ultimately, I like Orion. He obviously cares about the player and even though he doesn't shut up and is at lest 50% of why everyone in the game thinks you are weird, he's nice. Downside, in his desire to protect her, he's kinda paranoid. At least, outside Toma's route where he's weirdly supportive of Toma for most of it, where the other four he distrusts for most of the game. This is probably because around the time he starts to trust the other guys in their storylines, [spoiler]he stops trusting Toma in his because he's been drugging you[/spoiler]. Toma's route was the least interesting one, I think, due to [spoiler]Toma being a rather weak yandere. I hesitate to say he's a badly written yandere, but I would call him a mild or weak yandere. He's more stable and sane than the typical yandere, likely to make him seem more normal and keep in with his friendly attitude, but the effect doesn't really work. You can see they CAN write yandere characters, because Ikki's fangirls contain a lot of yanderes, namely Rika in Ikki's route[/spoiler]. I will say, though, his route calls for trigger warnings, so be cautious. Toma also has a unique metre that I feel Shin and Ukyo could have used, but meh.\n\nKent is slightly possessive and unsure of his emotions (he actually reminds me a little of Axel from OZMAFIA! in that he's slightly robotic about emotions and possessive). He's calm, cool, collected, and kind of a dork? Kent's idea of an apology present is a maths workbook he made for me and I found that to be ridiculously adorable even though I don't like maths and I think that was when I decided that yeah, he was a keeper.\n\nIkki is actually enjoyable once you get past the initial few days (I actually started his route first because I wasn't paying attention to the opening video and missed the cues that said who was what route. I was actually aiming for Kent's route first, I'm a fan of glasses characters, and started Ikki's by accident. I would have done it if not for his saying I can \"wait as long as I need to\" for him on that first day). Once you get past that, he's actually pretty darling, and I'm usually averse to the flirty guys. He's also the only one I got a bad end for. I got it on purpose, though.\n\nShin is actually pretty fun and I took to him pretty fast even though he comes off as kind of a jerk because it's clear his comments come from a good place. His I did third and it really threw me for a loop because I just wasn't expecting [spoiler]an Ace Attorney-esque attempted murder investigation. I really was reminded of Ace Attorney Investigations[/spoiler]. Shin I think might have the most deep feelings for the heroine, and I love the sheer trust he has in her and that she has in him. I can see why he's the mascot guy. Shin treats his feelings very matter-of-fact, which helps sell the bit.\n\nUkyo is an absolute sweetheart once you are on his route most of the time and like Shin, his kind of has a mystery going. His ending made me cry because I'm a sucker for stuff like that. Ukyo isn't my favourite of the guys, but I do like him a great deal. His feelings are the strongest, I think, compared to Shin's running the deepest. Ukyo seems to feel the need to prove it more than Shin and goes to great lengths for that happy ending. Also it's crazy easy to get a bad end in his route.\n\nThe other characters- the Heroine, Mine, Waka, Rika, and Sawa- are pretty fun. Mine is your frenemy and she's actually kind of fun, Sawa reminds me of my IRL best friend and I thought she was Axel's sister at first because they dress alike, Waka's personality changes depending on the route and this is hilarious to me (especially on Ikki's route. Say it with me: \"the customer is the enemy!\"), and Rika is... well, the game says she's weird and I can't disagree with that. Also she tried to kill me dead once so I was paranoid around her in Ukyo's route. The Heroine is just an idiot sometimes, or all the time in Toma's route.\n\nHaving cleared the game('s good endings), I do kinda wonder [spoiler]why they even have a \"Suspicion\" metre if three of the five guys are gonna figure it out before Day 3. Kent figures it out midway through the month and Ikki has to be outright told near the end of the month, but Ukyo figures it out after one dialogue tree, Toma by the end of the first day, and Shin by the morning of Day 2, regardless of your choices[/spoiler]. Seems useless outside the first two routes I did.\n\nOverall, the gameplay is fun. I really like the stories, I like the characters, the voices are fitting, I was never bored playing it, the art is gorgeous. Also speaking of, I've never played Persona but the art style and layouts remind me a lot of what I've seen of Persona. Which for all I know, the same people made it but I don't know. The only real issue I come away with is most of Toma's arc. I did come in not knowing that [spoiler]he's supposed to be a yandere, though, so I was surprised by it[/spoiler]. So sure, yeah, I can recommend this game. I had a lot of fun playing it and each storyline was interesting in its own way, Toma's included. There's five long and unique routes for you to play with lots of endings(mostly bad, but there are Normal and Good ones). Oh, and minigames.\n\nSpeaking of the minigames, I wouldn't recommend using a trackpad or a touchscreen with them, the game nopes into oblivion and you lose.

These relationships are not healthy at all. My first route was Kent, since I like nerdier guys, but he was awful. He was mean and bossy.\n-- But! There are som fun things in this game even though I didn't like it that much. The art and voice acting is indeed perfect. I liked the voices a lot and they fit their character.

In their stead, there's a spirit named Orion. Apparently, for reasons unknown, Orion has crashed into the mind of our protagonist and caused her to lose her memories. Now, n order to get them back and return to normal life ASAP, our protagonist - with Orion's much-needed help - must reclaim them herself all the while hiding it from the people around her. With her memories gone, who can she trust? \n\nAs always, I would highly recommend playing each route at least once on your own before turning to walkthroughs. \nI used this one (https://otomedreamworld.wordpress.com/?s=amnesia+memories). Without a doubt the best I found. \n\nThe characters - \n\nOrion: \nOrion doesn't have a route, as he is your ever so cheerful and ever so hilarious spirit guide.\nJust think of him as your best friend and the voice of reason. He'll always be on your side and will always do his best to help you out. Orion is a true friend during the tough times to come. \n\nShin: \nShin is your childhood friend turned boyfriend. \nHe may be harsh at times - who am I kidding, pretty much all the time - but underneath it all there's a heart that beats just for you. \nPersonally speaking, Shin is my first favorite turned the second favorite (Sorry, Shin! I love you but I couldn't resist Ukyo once I reached his route). \n\nIkki: \nIkki is a true contradiction. \nPrepare yourself for some major confusion and frustration. \nBut if you play your cards right, you'll find out what's really going on under all of the pretend. \nJust beware of the girls. \n\nKent: \nYou may want to punch Kent in the face more often than not but restrain yourselves and you won't regret it. \nKent may seem like a heartless genius, but it's only what there is on the surface. You don't have to wait too long to see that. \n\nToma: \nAh, Toma. \nEver so protective \"big brother\" Toma. \nI shall say no more about him since the rest should come as a complete and utter surprise (mixed with shock). \n\nUkyo: \n.... \nYou can only play Ukyo's route after getting all of the other characters good endings. \nThink of Ukyo as the last boss. \nEvery question still left unanswered... you'll get on his route. \n\nAnd that's pretty much it. \nDon't forget to play the mini games and the memories after completing each route for some more fun times. \nAnd when you complete it all, you'll also unlock some extras to read. \n\nTrust your gut, follow Orion, and find our the truth. \nAfter that... \nGood luck!", "timestamp_created": 1492152312, "timestamp_updated": 1492152312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31126977": {"recommendationid": "31126977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012727270", "num_games_owned": 455, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489326475}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm feeling violated after this.\nI enjoyed it.", "timestamp_created": 1492132530, "timestamp_updated": 1492132530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31116507": {"recommendationid": "31116507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291099355", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500973274}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\n\u96d6\u7136\u73a9\u7684\u4e00\u982d\u9727\u6c34\n\u4f46\u662f\u5f88\u80fd\u6eff\u8db3\u5c11\u5973\u5fc3", "timestamp_created": 1492090475, "timestamp_updated": 1492090475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31109894": {"recommendationid": "31109894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116668487", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1932, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511989962}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of my favorite visual novels.\n\nI was really stunned, how good this game is, although it's so old (for a vn). The story is great, the pacing is really good and the music also fits very well.\n\nThe story, although it's [spoiler] about amnesia [/spoiler] is very well done. The main isn't that stupid or helpless and she isn't a damsel in distress, but tries to do her best in her own way. I really like her. She also doesn't try to seduce the guys, but tries to be not a burden to them. It's more about love than romance - she tries to find [spoiler] her own memories, while falling in love with the guys, who are kind to her[/spoiler]. Also it has something like redemption as a theme too [spoiler] e.g. in Shin's route, when Touma explains that he tried to kill her... or when the MC realizes that Kent really loves her and she was just awful to him without a real \"reason\" [/spoiler] \n\nThe art is rather okay, but you can't expect it to be as well as in the recent games. BTW Amnesia has sequels, but they aren't translated in english. But in those you can see, how the art improved.\n\nAbout the stories itself: There were good one's and there were not that good ones. My favorite is Touma, although [spoiler] he is a yandere, who drugs you, kills you a few times and locks you in a cage, if you don't pay attention.[/spoiler] But Touma is also [spoiler] a really sweet guy. He is the one, who knows that you have amnesia from the beginning, and I SWEAR IF THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE LOVES YOU A LOT THAN I DON'T KNOW OK [/spoiler]\nAside from trying to explain my liking to him, there are also Kent's and [spoiler] Ukyo's [/spoiler] stories that are great.\nIkki's story was okay-ish, but maybe it's because I don't like this type of guys...\nShin's story wasn't that good though, so I'd start with him. His personality wasn't really ... well, he is slightly annoying and I don't like him. He's a jerk most of the time... a very cold jerk.\n\nAnyway, a fair warning: Most likely you will play through the whole game after buying it... And you won't sleep or do anything else before finishing it. \n\nSUMMARY:\nThere is a great story, great characters and great music\nThe pacing is awesome\nYou don't want to stop playing after buying it\nThe order I'd recommend:\nShin -> Ikki -> Kent -> Touma -> [spoiler] Ukyo [/spoiler]\nThe main character is REALLY AMAZING \n-> I don't know many vn, where the main isn't annoying or a damsel in distress...\nThe art is also very nice\n\n==> Buy it. Play it. And you will like it, if you like visual novel.

What annoyed me is how much of a freaking doormat the MC is-- I know that's the norm in otome games but this was ridiculous.  Her life is in danger and all she can say is \"I still love you~  uwu~\" Like c'mon, at least run away you idiot.

I like otome games and dating sims, and the art looked great. Unfortunately, I didn't think to check the negative reviews and really wish I had. Reviewers bring up legitimate concerns about the way the game handles abusive relationships that anyone thinking about buying the game should really consider. \n\nMy main complaints are:\n\n1) I know it's a visual novel, but I would've liked more choices in general. I.e., more dialogue/response choices, and the ability to override Orion's mandates (or ANY of the characters' decisions, actually) and make your own decisions about what the MC is going to do. Instead, I felt like a helpless bystander watching the MC be victimized again and again. \n\n2) The MC is a blank slate but you can't really do anything with that. She is passive and submissive throughout. It would've been so much better if you could actually shape her character (there was so much potential there!). It's really telling that she works at a maid cafe where customers are addressed as \"master\" and whatnot. That same subservience translates into her personal relationships, apparently. \n\n3) The MC's lack of characterization is replaced by Orion, who reacts to and reiterates everything; basically, he's telling you how you \"should\" respond to what's going on. This could've been ok if he provided insight rather than pointing out the immediately obvious, and if you could actually shape the MC's character. \n\n4) Lastly, though a matter of personal taste, I wish there was more variety in the characters' styles. As in, it'd be ok if one or two characters were punk or whatever they are, but they're ALL part of the Hot Topic clique. Except the MC, oddly enough. \n\nAll that said, I do want to acknowledge that the artwork looks good and the voice acting was good. And some might really like the characters' aesthetic and some or all of the routes, unhealthy as they are IRL. I get that.

After watching the anime series, I knew a few things about the characters, but the dark turns that the game takes are just perfect.  It really shows that everyone has secrets or flaws that they don't show the world, and in my opinion, really helps make them seem more real despite their fantastical appearances.\n\nOverall, I would highly recomend this game to anyone who enjoys visual novels or dating sims, or to someone who is just getting into the genre.

Because I was that tomboy, too. Then I gave this game a try and I was fully surprised at the twists and turns this story took. There's a lot more here than just trying to get your choice of supposedly hot guy, and all the characters have their own distinct personalities. There's even character to the girl you play as, though most of it's still trying to be as directly interactive as it can.\n\nThere are surprisingly dark turns in here as well, and one of my favorite features for any video game: multiple endings.

through rock and through.\nCome apart at the seams.\nNow I know what dying means.\n\nI am not my rose itself,\nLeft my roses on my shelf.\nTake the wild ones, they're my favorites.\nIt's the side

I didn't expect much, but I was pleasantly surprised at how engaged I was. While each romance option is a stereotype, I feel they're very well done here. Character tropes are fine as long as the execution is there. My personal favorites are Shin and Kent. The stories for each individual guy are easy to follow and told pretty well. The overarching plot, as explained in Ukyo's route, is a bit confusing, but nothing too egregious (they fucked it up real bad in the anime though). The art is gorgeous, and while the soundtrack as a whole is nothing to write home about, I'm a huge fan of the OP and ED.\n\nAs for the topic of unhealthy relationships, I can certainly agree Toma's is fucked as all hell, and shit gets pretty crazy with Ukyo, but other than that... eh? Shin is rough around the edges, Ikki's flirtation is explained by his \"condition,\" and Kent just doesn't understand love. But they all take care of you, never go further than they sense you're comfortable with, and it's established that you were in a relationship with them before hand. OF COURSE they're going to be affectionate until they learn of your amnesia. \n\nAnyways, that's just my thoughts. Heroine is a terrible character though, I'll give you that. 8/10\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1485906948, "timestamp_updated": 1485906948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647510", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29603012": {"recommendationid": "29603012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088152220", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485860051}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich bin vermutlich das falsche Publikum f\u00fcr dieses Spiel.

This includes but not limited to; Murdering, kidnapping,  sexual asult. So please keep that in mind while playing this game. Its really stressful and heart wrenching at times, but maybe its like a train wreck, that everyone kinda wants to watch.\n\nThrough the game you make choices that lead to many endings, Good, Normal, and Bad endings. Good endings is where everything that happened comes to a good light hearted conclusion, a 360 turn around from the rough story you just went through. Normal ending is pretty much....well normal, it ends well, though you are not in any relationship. Bad endings are those horrid ones, the ones where the screen goes red with the \"BAD END\" written in black letters.....pretty much, you died, game over, hope you made a save spot because you might want to retry that crap. (Though luckily for those who dont save the game has a skip feature that skips all the reading and even highlights your last choices so you know what you may have chosen wrong) That being said however it must be noted, Guess what! You get achievements for each end! Goody!\n\nThe art, story and characters all have real depth, amazingly done! I even had to take pictures of the little slides between days to enjoy the cute scetches of the man of choice! Which brings me to my last point. Least violent characters, and most violent characters. However no matter where on the list you still get abused in ways, hurt, and even murdered.\n here is my personal list on who is least violent to most and some what why. \n[b]Slight spoiler warning if you want this info so you have been warned. [/b]\n\n[olist]\n\n[*] [spoiler]Kent: He is the logical one, kinda just never did relationships. Gets excited for dating just half a month, kinda slow but cute.[/spoiler]\n\n[*][spoiler] Ikki: He opens up as cocky, but turns out to just be looking for love, though you fear him dumping you and his fans are horrid to you. Bitches be crazy.[/spoiler]\n\n[*][spoiler]Shin : Nothing like being called an Idiot every 10 minutes and getting lied to every 5 minutes! This attempt of murder to you is done and you have to find out who done it! Careful![/spoiler]\n\n[*][spoiler] Toma: Nothing like waking up locked away! <3 #relationshipgoals! (oh god please no) My personal least favorite, been through slimier bad relationships, not wanting to let you go anywhere, you cant do this, wear this, but to an extreme. IM NOT YOUR PET TOMA![/spoiler]\n\n[*] [spoiler]Ukyo: Yeah, that is right, by the time you get this you have had to gotten at least one good or normal ending in all the others, and if you haven't gotten the bad ones..... you may be thinking, \"Oh him..? No way....he was so sweet and innocent!~\" NEVER TRUST THE QUIET ONES!\n[/spoiler]\n\n\nI highly recommend this game if you dont want the normal OTOME experience. This dark mystery will leave you guessing for a while. Just remember, This is not how you want your real relationships people, Normalizing real abuse is not a good thing, things like this happen, well....without all the mythical, magical, demon stuff. Abuse happens, and if you are in an abusive relationship, get help the national abuse hotline is toll free, 24/7 at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

Each route has different trials and tribulations as you develop your relationship.\n\n[spoiler]Sometimes, the plot can seem a bit forced like awkwardly penned fanfiction, especially in Ikki\u2019s route. I personally found Kent\u2019s route to be the most normal, refreshing, and fulfilling.[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, it\u2019s really enjoyable getting to know all the different characters. By the time I got 100% on the game, I liked (or at least understood) everyone, which is rare. See the Game-Specific Comments for more detail.\n\n[h1]Gameplay [10/10][/h1]\nIt\u2019s a visual novel with typical choices. It\u2019s a 10 for lack of things to criticize.\n\n[h1]Graphics [5/10][/h1]\nWhile the characters are crisply drawn, unique, and expressive, you have to wonder why they\u2019re walking around wearing punk-rock outfits all the time. You\u2019re a university student; some of the love interests are also students \u2014 there\u2019s no way they\u2019re wearing that day-to-day in Japan! Also, in contrast to the abysmal anime of Amnesia, [spoiler]there\u2019s no ballin\u2019 rock band get-together in any of the routes[/spoiler], so the design choice to have [spoiler]Kent[/spoiler], especially, wrapped in a trenchcoat and belts is a strange one. Though the backgrounds are decent enough, they have little detail and become repetitive as you play though the game. This game really wants you to focus on the foreground; the characters and their expressions. The characters are intricate, so mission accomplished.\n\n[h1]Soundtrack [6/10][/h1]\nThe soundtrack is mostly there just to fill silences. None of the pieces are very memorable during the game, though the title sequence by Zoetrope as well as the theme played at the successful end of the route get honorable mentions. You might get some of the tracks stuck in your head if you play the game for a while, but they aren\u2019t melodies you\u2019ll carry with you after (in contrast to games like Skyrim with songs you\u2019ll probably listen to once you\u2019re done playing).\n\n[h1]Replayability [8/10][/h1]\nI read a guide to get all possible endings, including the bad ones. It was fun (and occasionally disturbing) to see all of the outcomes for the heroine. If you fall in love with fictional characters, you\u2019ll enjoy playing through the routes again for [strike]a bishounen fix[/strike] waifu simulation.\n\n[h1]Overall [8/10][/h1]\nIt\u2019s well-made and one of the better visual novels you can get on Steam. I enjoyed playing it all the way to 100% completion and will probably replay my favourite routes a few times.\n\n[h1]Game-Specific Comments[/h1]\nAs many other reviewers note, this game tends to portray [b]very unhealthy relationships[/b]. Two of the routes involve the heroine [spoiler]being physically assaulted and being trapped in a cage. No exaggeration. Your boyfriends in those routes have serious mental problems that aren\u2019t really examined or brought to light. And, in [i]another[/i] route, one of those boyfriends becomes the antagonist![/spoiler] Though I personally find two of the love interests to make very unhealthy/distasteful/abusive choices as partners, it may be examined differently in Japanese than Western culture. The remainder of the love interests are fairly human and make normal relationship mistakes.

It helped me to understand real-life people and how they express themselves, if more pensive or passion showed. It may sound cheesy, but it did.

If you played this route, you might already know why I felt the need to do this. \n\nI played Kent's route first. It seemed fairly normal, for the most part, the way these sort of games go. I eventually came around to liking him a little, despite his stupid sexist reactions to be being in a bathing suit where other men *gasp* might see me. I don't like the underlining theme that men just can't control themselves around a beautiful girl. And girls have to protect themselves by not being so damn cute. Gag me. \n\nBut I put up with it, assuming it was just a culture thing from Japan. Not that I approve of it nor would I put up with it in my own relationship. But okay, it's a game. Whatever. At least it's not abuse...\n\nAnd then I played the diamond route. \n\nThis game gets super messed up in a really creepy and uncomfortable way. I thought it was just because I was triggering his bad ending, but then upon another (extremely reluctant) playthrough, the events pretty much follow the same lines. It was extremely unsettling the amount of abuse dished upon you that in order to get a good ending, you needed to forgive. I did not want to forgive. That seems like the most volitale destructive relationship I have ever witnessed in media. And all the characters seem to just laugh off Toma's actions at the end as just overprotectiveness. I'm sorry, no? How about hell no? Nothing could be done to forgive what Toma put your character through. Absolutely nothing.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful. The stories I've played so far have been engaging and interesting. But I'm gonna say, do not play Toma's story if you are looking for a healthy relationship. You will not find it there. Please do not idolize that relationship in any way.

[spoiler]Osananajimi x2.[/spoiler]\n*I liked the presence of other characters in a particular capture target's route. [spoiler]\"It was as if devil had granted my wish.\" ...Or Lord Nhil...[/spoiler]\n*I enjoyed the mini-games, especially winning at them; I would've liked for them to have been incorporated into the story itself though.\n*I loved doing Kent's math puzzles.\n*[spoiler]Despite what others say, I thought yandere Toma was cute~[/spoiler]\n\nWhat I Disliked\n*I'm not too big a fan of having a character route locked down so quickly. I'd prefer several choices to be made in order to choose a route. (I was expecting that the heroine would have to raise affection with a particular character first to lock into their route.)\n*I would have liked for the heroine to be have been voiced even though she has few lines.\n*Additionally, I would have liked for every character to have a sprite even though some some minor. [spoiler]I believe *Kent's mother and Taeko did not have sprites but did have voiced lines. I mainly feel this way because some of Ikki's fanclub members do have sprites.[/spoiler] \n*I wish there was a music room, so the BGM could be replayed on its own.\n*I would have liked a harem option.

[spoiler]Though I suppose some of the bad endings are?[/spoiler]\n*I wished there were more math puzzles. [spoiler]Especially the more complex one Kent mentioned in his good ending...[/spoiler]\n*I felt like some Ukyo could have been fleshed out some more. [spoiler]I don't think the game really got much into why he has such a destructive alternate personality much, other than saying it was due to the distress of dying so many times. My first assumption was that Lord Nhil became corrupted from being with Ukyo for so long, and he was the alternate personality.[/spoiler]\n\nOther Comments\n*I read one review complaining about the heroine lacking a personality, but I think it's purposely that way because it's an otome game. The heroine is supposed to be [i]you[/i] after all. It's something of an immersion factor I suppose, so you can pretend that you're truly dating these guys.\n*I...didn't know there was an anime...", "timestamp_created": 1484055764, "timestamp_updated": 1484093644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29159344": {"recommendationid": "29159344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281338075", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483289641}, "language": "english", "review": "The storyline as well as the character personality of each of the characters (depending on the route you take) were very well though out.

I have played backstage pass and Blood Code. One thing that makes this game stand apart from the others is the fact YOU DO NOT PLAY THE SAME STORY OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN PURSUING THE OTHER CHARACTERS! THIS IS AWESOME! I think this is a huge feature. I know I haven't played a whole lot of Otome games, but I am thinking, based on my experience, that a lot of otome games force you to replay the same story and based on your choices, changes your end story a bit. \n\nVisually, this story is good (just wish they wore better clothing...yikes!), but overall it is stunning. Amnesia memories is a novel game sort of like a choose your own adventure books you might have read and been familiar with when you were younger. \n\nThe story line is decent too. If you like otome games you will most likely like this game. The basic premise of the story is a girl who had a spirit collide her mind and now has amnesia. She needs to go through the various worlds (where there is a new guy she is supposed to pursue) without letting them know she HAS amnesia. The mystery of the story involves a guy who pops up occasionally. He seems to know more about the heroine than he should and warns the heroine of danger. He either appears that he has genuine concern or is downright creepy - seeming to take pleasure in the idea that the heroine might die. \n\nThere is one path that really depicts an unhealthy relationship with boy Yandere (in the simplistic term...a psychopath) if it was to happen in the real world there is no way I would entertain someone like that...BUT it isn't the real world. Personally, I liked his path, if nothing else than to scare the hell out of me. It made me tread very carefully in all the paths and raised my level of distrust.\n\nIn each path you can have a bad ending, normal ending, and good ending. It was fun to see what happened if I responded to the characters naturally. \n\nThe final path wraps the story nicely. It explains the reason Orion (the spirit) collides with her mind and why this guy keeps showing up. \n\nI guess that is all I can say about it without giving away the story. Its good! I like it. I hope Idea Factory brings out more games including Amnesia Later, Crowd, and World. BUT I also heard they have a few other popular games as well. Most North Americans do not own psp vita in comparison to over there and instead have the consoles or computers. Just don't download illegally. It is annoying and is apparently one of the main sole reasons they are hesitant to introduce these games over here. \n\nThe fact is that these kind of games are new to North Americans.

Plus, the dialogue is all voice-acting with English subtitles.  That alone makes it worth the money spent (though I bought it on sale, I did not pay full price for it).  The only gripe I have is how the game calculates your answers to give the endings.  Without revealing too much in the way of spoilers, I read through one story, got all the way up to a love confession/kiss scene, yet immediately after that the story took a downhill turn (without any more input from me) and I ended up with a neutral ending.  The story clearly took a turn based on my immediate choices (the kiss scene), then reached a point of calculation to add up all of my choices to provide me with a neutral ending.  I was quite frustrated since everything after that scene made no sense.  Still, the characters were well-developed and the plot was interesting.  I'm currently in the heart world as my second story choice, and it is a completely different story though the characters are all the same.

Once in a while I caught myself stopping to read just to look at the pictures that appear once in a while (which you can afterwards find in the gallery :DD) and I really enjoyed everything.\n\nThe stories you can experience are not only very different and crisp, they sometimes touch each other so that if you've already gone one path, you might be reminded of something that happened in the other path, only that in this path it's not really affecting you. So it feels really well thought-out and you keep on guessing, what might be the big mystery of each story and even though I flatter myself to be good in foreseeing the ending or the background of a story, I was hopelessly pushed around by so many theories I made up. So the game gives you hints but it's still pretty hard to find out until the end. (It's also hard to figure out, which answer is best to get your desired ending).\n\nAbout the characters I must say that they really have very different personalities and you end up liking everyone in their own way. My first path was Ikki and I didn't like Kent from the beginning. But when I got to his path and storyline, I ended up smiling and liking him so very much. I'm glad I didn't skip him.\n\nOne story was kind of... borderline and some dialogues or happenings in the game shouldn't be seen as more than drama in a game (the asian cultures likes to push drama to it's limits I guess). Of course all this is not to be seen serious and only (science) fiction without the display of real relationships in our world. But that's what you play a gome for. To experience something different to our world and have fun. \n\nDespite the fact that your character really seems a bit faceless (which might be because of her memory-loss - though it's at least handy to not have a heroine you don't like...) and the sometimes borderline scenes, there was one thing that I would have liked different. There are seemingly only three types of music. The normal track, the drama/dangerous track and the soft/lovely track. That's all...

Firstly, I have to say I enjoyed the art and voice-acting. The story was intriguing enough that I played through all five worlds so that I could figure out the entire mystery.\n\nBut Amnesia left me with a really bad taste in my mouth. It doesn't portray any healthy relationships, and makes light of verbal and sexual abuse, kidnapping, and murder in the name of love. It feels like the company is going for  dark, edgy stories, but they're creating some really horrible and abusive male characters in the process. \"Anything is okay, as long as I love you\" is the message that gets sent. It's not romantic or beautiful, it's creepy and disturbing. I didn't get the warm, fluffy feelings I was looking for, but unsettling ones instead.\n\nI needed brain bleach after Toma's route, in which you're held hostage \"for your own protection.\" Shin, the token bad boy that dishes out tough love and verbally abuses you throughout his entire story, was intolerable. Yes, there is Kent, the only normal one, but he was too little, too late. Playing through all the routes, I didn't feel as if I was being offered different stories about love, but more of the same crap treatment. While I wanted to run in the opposite direction, getting the good endings required me to love him unconditionally no matter what he did to me. I know Amnesia is a work of fiction, but toxic relationships should not be romanticized. I really wish the men were better people. Then I would have actually enjoyed this game.\n\nIt also made me uncomfortable and gross to play as a helpless female character that goes along with everything the men feel like doing and saying to her. She is sexually harassed in most of the routes. She is drugged and caged in a second, and murdered multiple times in a third. Yet, she says nothing, never fights back, and forgives instantly. For the entirety of the game, she comes off as a passive and docile robot doll whose life revolves around not offending her love interest. I wonder if the developers think this is an attractive way to act in relationships--meek, obedient, and willing to forgive all the horrible things done to her. The MC could have easily been written as someone proactive and smart, and unwilling to take BS. I would play the hell out of a game like that. But instead, we got someone whose dialogue choices are literally \"...\" or \"...Um.\"\n\nLastly, all the other women in the game, with the exception of her best friend, Sawa, are created to be jealous of the attention MC is receiving from men to the point of bullying and attempting murder on her. It really aggravates me when female characters are created to be so one dimensional, as if women's lives revolve solely around hating and plotting against each other.\n\nHonestly, I feel bad that I supported a game like this instead of one with healthy portrayals of relationships, respectful treatment and representation of women, and a strong heroine. I'm in the process of playing Nameless ~The one thing you must recall~ by Cheritz, the amazing company that developed Mystic Messenger. So far, I would highly recommend it over Amnesia. The MC has a personality and the men are likable and not creepy. Cheritz also made Dandelion - Wishes brought to you -.

I had already watched the anime, so I knew a few things about the characters beforehand. I love how all of them are more than what you see at first glance, there's always another layer hidden underneath what you see immediately.\n\nThere's Shin, your kinda tsundere childhood friend,[spoiler] who manages to figure out you don't have your memories immediately. He's been into you for so long, and depsite acting a bit aloof at times, he cares deeply and will fight to make you fall in love with him again.[/spoiler]\n\nIkki, the flirty guy who seems to change girlfriends more often than he does his clothes. [spoiler]But it wasn't him who started it - [i]They[/i] broke up with [i]him[/i]. So he decided if that's all he gets, he'll just have fun, despite still hoping for actual love.[/spoiler]\n\nKent, a guy who studies math and seems almost emotionless. [spoiler]He's trying, he's just so incredibly bad with people. He even researches how to act with your girlfriend, trying to make you happy.[/spoiler]\n\nToma, your other childhood friend who's been almost like your older brother (Which he even calls himself in other routes). [spoiler]OH GREAT NOW THAT DARN YANDERE DRUGGED YOU AND PUT YOU IN A CAGE! [s]He honestly scared the hell out of me, sorry Toma fans[/s].[/spoiler]\n\nAnd after finishing all others, you get access to Ukyo's route. [spoiler]Yep, that guy who seemed rather deranged and, depending on your play style, may have killed you before. Talking about him would take up WAY too much space, so I won't do so here.[/spoiler]\n\nEvery boy has several endings. One good, one normal and several bad, depending on your relationship with him (Although some choices get you immediate Bad Ends), so you have more than enough reason to play the game again and again, trying out the other choices. Since you can save at any time, there's nothing stopping you from especially trying out the ones you immediately know are bad.\n\nI've gotten 100% in this game, all endings, all CGs, all achievements...

It's just like anime, the character you play [spoiler] doesnt have any actual freaking character at all. In every storyline, you actually realize that she acted differently to different people, not just that, you really have no idea why would these people fell in love with the Heroine, because shes an empty shell.[/spoiler] PROS OF THIS: [spoiler]you're not stuck with a heroine you don't really like most of the time, dream. I guess It's good she's not a dumb 3rd grader that youd hate. [/spoiler]\n\nNot CONS not PROS\n = Ugh achievements. I mean, Story achievements are fun to get because that's what makes this game beautiful, storylines, but ffs that Gallery sound achievement is just ridiculous.\n=  Mini games. OK they're rather easy, but just to let you know, Air Hockey game can get annoying because the faster you try to move, the faster the FPS drops. Remember, this game was made for Vita, not PC. \n\nTL;DR\nIt's an amazing game for otome/visual novel lovers. A must have I say. For people who are not really into them, If you're not cringing by just seeing shoujos/animes, then just try it, storylines won't really bore you, and they're enjoyable a lot.", "timestamp_created": 1481889574, "timestamp_updated": 1482452589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629630", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28353358": {"recommendationid": "28353358", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049991149", "num_games_owned": 1382, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 1999, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482573296}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an impressive game.

Were there routes that I didn't enjoy very much, sure. But this didn't take away from my over all enjoyment of the game itself. There were times that I found myself frustrated with the heroine and my lack of ability to answer the way I felt I would (there we a good few \"Oh hell no's\" that I would have liked to slap down now and then but couldn't). But an otome game cannot reasonably encompass any and all possible reactions that a person would have to a situation and still tell a cohesive story. On that note the story here is, in my opinion, a good one. It is also a rather expansive amount of content for the price. While a good deal of my hours logged were spent leaving the game on while I did other things, I still spent several hours playing through this game and getting each end.\n\nThere's also a bit of a culture gap for this game. It's not severe (and by no means a reason to over look the game) but it's definitely there. This occationally frustrated me as well, the way the males act with the heroine at times and the meek way that she reacts probably stems from a culture thing more then her being a \"weak character\" as some are prone to describe. I try to remind myself when playing games that originate somewhere so different that in certain cultures it is seen as attractive or appropriete for a man to tell a woman she shouldn't let other men look at her, or to grab her and roughly drag her away and then yell. This is seen as being \"manly\" and \"protective\", it is considered a good trait in a partner. Though I may strongly disagree with that conclusion, my culture is different.\n\nTLDR: It's a really good game and if you like otome games you should play it.

Trust me, his path is not logical at all, and you may end up having a frustrative bad ending even if you do not set it as your goal. You may want to enjoy the other, better routes at first.\n\nThe four different characters are all very different. Toma is secretive and shows his kind mask, Shin is a bit of a cool delinquent, who is very smart and amazing sometimes. Ikki is a womanizer on the outside, but he has more to it. Kent is sosially very thick-headed, but clever as a mathbook. And needless to say, your companion spirit-boy Orion is very entertaining with all the comments and funny faces he does. He really adds more to the game.\n\nAlso, the starting music is awesome and the soundtrack is nicely supporting the athmosphere.

I'm really not into men who keep women in cages without their consent. \n\nOn a more serious note, my consensus: Definitely not the best visual novel I've played, but definitely not the worst. You can tell a lot of effort and polish had gone into this game, it's very well made and gorgeous to look at, even if the writing and characters fell flat for me. Considering how rare it is for games of any substance to be translated from Japanese, and how widely known and popular this game is I'd likely reccomend this to any otome/romance gamer... just know what you're getting into. II seem to be mostly alone in my opinion that it's cliche ridden in a bad way, and quite frustrating. The plot had a lot of potential, some of the characters did too, it just didn't hit any of the right notes for me. On top of that, there is a LOT of non-consenual/violent behaviour/groping/pinning/bad stuff, which is EXTREMELY BAD in a certain route, less present in the others but still definitely a factor. I can't stand this kind of behaviour glorified, not just in the 'yandere route' but in the others that are supposed to be far from that. There are otome games that handle yandere/violent characters in ways that make it interesting, this is not one of them.\n\nHowever, there's a lot of content in this game, considering the price tag, and it's an absolute steal on sale. As aforementioned it'is not without it's flaws, quite stuck in standard character tropes and hindered by a frustratingly blank slate main character and cute-but-annoying-after-a-while sidekick. The appeal of the love interests is highly dependent on personal preference, it's not really a well rounded cast in my opinion. It's likely that one will appeal to you and the others will be 'meh' [strike]or AHHH GET AWAY FROM ME[/strike], which takes away from the overall enjoyment of the game. The plot was interesting enough to pull me through, though I thought it was poorly handled, once I'd commited to it I didn't stop.\n\nSo, should you buy this game? I don't know. I really don't. It was a mixed bag, but if supporting it means other Japanese games potentially being translated? I don't know. Did I enjoy this game? To an extent, yes.

It's a high quality release with gorgeous art and extra features. That alone was enough to make the whole $3 I paid (thanks Steam sales!) more than worth the price. After playing the game, I can say that I could have paid more and still gotten my money's worth. Not sure if I would feel the same if I had paid full price, though.\n\nAs far as visual novels go, the story of this one was...interesting. I had read reviews of Amnesia, so I knew what I was getting into before I bought it. It's a strange cookie...definitely not my usual reading material. But I was thoroughly entertained, nonetheless. This is no masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but I think it more than qualifies as a guilty pleasure.\n\nAt the least, I enjoyed the game enough to want to play more otome games.

Parece que ela simplesmente ama o boy sem ele ter feito nada. \nPor\u00e9m, no sentido da rela\u00e7\u00e3o boy-heroine, fica pouco a desejar. T\u00eam cenas fofas, e elas v\u00e3o te deixar corada.

Meio carinho por\u00e9m vale a pena - s\u00e3o muitas horas de gameplay at\u00e9 pegar todos os finais. Tome cuidado que alguns finais d\u00e3o medo e podem te deixar mal.

Each of them has their good and bad sides, each of them can be liked. I also enjoyed secondary characters, especially Waka.\n\n[b]Writing.[/b] Writing is very good and same goes for translation - very often translated games are overly simplistic in terms of used words and dialogues tends to looks fake, but here everything is polished.\n\n[b]Story.[/b] There is a depth to this game, few secrets to uncover, there are also some darker corners that you may find yourself in, if you made a bad choices along the way. I really like the sense of threat in this game. The atmosphere really drags you in, even on the routes that may be less interesting. \n\n[b]MC isn't a victim.[/b] After my long and painful adventures with Dandelion and Nameless, where protagonists were presented as the most unhappy people in the world, despite not having legitimately good reasons for it, this was a very refreshing thing. Especially since here, protagonist actually could easily be painted that way - she suffers from memory loss, she hears a spirit that never shuts up (seriously, dear God!), she doesn't know who to trust, on few routes she is almost murdered, her life and health is in danger, yet neither she, nor other characters, refers to her in a way that makes her look like a constant victim.\n\n[b]Price.[/b] I will be honest with you, if Amnesia: Memories is a type of game you would enjoy, full price for the whole content is almost a steal, especially if it's compared to other titles available on Steam. Each route (4 normal + secret one) has one good, one normal and at least two bad ends to experience. There is fair amount of text, CGs, there are extras, like gallery and even mini-games and additional scenes to unlock. Also, if you can't afford the full price, wait for sale - this games usually get a big discount, so you can buy it for around 5$.\n\n[b]Endings.[/b] Most of good/normal endings felt very satisfying to me. Actually, on some routes I preferred normal ending over good one, because it seem more natural to the characters. Bad ends really deserve a praise and the reason is rather simple. Very often, in visual novels, bad ends comes out of nowhere. You made a wrong choice somewhere and then suddenly you end up dead, in some strange love triangle, as a sex slave or something similarly \"pleasant\" even though it's never established before or hinted in any way. Here, pretty much every bad ending feels natural to the story. Usually [spoiler]Toma, Ukyo or Ikky's fans are the one causing protagonist harm[/spoiler] and their intentions are obvious, so when something bad happens, it has more meaning and sense.\n\n[h1]Bad things[/h1]\n\n[b]Orion.[/b] Yes, he's cute, for like first few scenes and then he gets more annoying with every spoken word. Just shut up, Orion, please, I don't need to you to repeat to me what I just witnessed or tell me how I should feel or perceive certain things, seriously, I'm playing this, am I not?! Of course Orion serves his purpose sometimes, but most of the time it seems like he's there just to cover the fact that protagonist says few sentences during whole route. There were moments when I was getting so frustrated with his long obvious monologues that I just skipped them and I rarely do that.\n\n[b]Protagonist.[/b] Now, this one is not that obvious. Despite her not being a victim, she's still a classic VN protagonist - naive, innocent and almost completely silent. I get it, she has amnesia and she tries to cover it, still, it would be nice for her to speak up a little bit more and ask about something for a change. That being said, amnesia is a pretty good explanation after all. Also, during flashbacks, protagonist has a bit more to say and from her boyfriends/friends words about her \"past self\" it seems like she had a pretty strong personality. \n\n[b]Provoking, oh provoking.[/b] I was so tired of hearing MC chosen ones saying (or should I say threatening?) that they will have \"their way with her\" or that she provokes them by just sitting next to them, or that they won't be able to hold back and all that bs. You would imagine she's doing something really bold to get this sort of reactions, but nope, she's just... there. \n\n[b]Few route-specific aspects that I will mention below.[/b]\n\n[h1]Routes[/h1]\n\n[b]Shin.[/b] [spoiler]I really liked his route. He's cold-headed and seem too mean at first, but the truth is, he's just honest. He prefers painful truth over sweet lies. There is an intriguing story here, about finding the culprit who harmed main character and even though it's fairly obvious, there were moments when I was suspecting Sawa.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Ikkyu.[/b] [spoiler]He's my least favorite. He's the most cliche of them all, his super eyes were beyond my suspension of disbelief, I didn't feel like he actually made an effort to make protagonist like him - he was just overly pushy and pretty creepy at times. Sorry, Ikkyu, but I don't think I would be willing to live under one roof with someone who openly states that he won't be able to hold his advances on me, to then change his mind and say that he was joking, to then change his mind again and say that I shouldn't be surprise if that happens. Thanks, but no thanks, stay with your fanclub.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Kent[/b] [spoiler]turned out to be my absolute favorite one. He's just so adorable at times, he tries to calculate his every move, he's very non-sociable and inexperienced in human relations. I felt like protagonist was the most honest with him and he, despite scientific approach, respected her explanation. He's also very caring and serious in his intentions from the very beginning.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Toma.[/b] [spoiler] Riiight. So I get it, we are on dangerous territory now, because some people adore Toma and defend him while others write this game a negative review only because his route is THAT way. So yeah, Toma is a creep. If this was your first route and you're, understandably, not into this sort of stuff, you may be disgusted and not enthusiastic to experience other routes. That being said, I don't feel like this route was as bad as it could be and I don't mean Toma's behavior. It was well written. On other routes (especially Shin's) there are heavy hints that Toma's feelings towards MC are very weird and that he's able to do bad things to her. When I was playing this route, I honestly felt the sense of threat, it was disturbing, like a good thriller story should be. I felt like my objective was to get as far away from this a-hole as I can and honestly, I would really wish if they went with something like that on good/normal endings and not classic Stockholm Syndrome: you've locked me up in cage and almost raped me, but I love you, so let's be together forever <3. Still, I would say it was enjoyable route, in this \"thriller-ish\" way.

My. Goodness.\nThis game is absolutely fantastic. I enjoyed every minute while playing this game. I loved all of the characters and how different they were from each other, the voice acting was amazing, the art is great, and the music was perfect at setting the mood. I truly wish I could play this again for the first time, even though I just finished every route and every possible ending just minutes ago.\n\nFirst of all, Orion (the MC's companion) is absolutely adorable. He truly made the game entertaining with his snarky side comments. At many points, he stated my exact IRL reaction to things that the boys say to the MC, and it's absolutely hilarious. He is the MC's voice of reason (usually). All of the romanceable boys were likable (although Ikki was my least favorite, but I still like him!) and each route brings something new to the table. I was not once bored playing this game. It's nice to see not only the boys grow during their routes, but the MC as well. When you can actually see her personality shine through, she's extremely likeable.\n\nNow, when I say all of the romanceable boys were likable, I know people will disagree with me since \"Diamond World\" boy is, uh, pretty crazy. Well, he is, it's true. Despite how insane he is, I did enjoy his route. It was very unconventional and portrayed the yandere type quite well. I enjoy when otome games shake things up a bit, so I found his route to be interesting. The MC seemed like she had some sort of stockholm syndrome thing goin' on if you play to get the good end... I'd rather have her knock some sense into him, but that's just me! At least the good end for him was nice. Anyways, all of the boys have some sort of flaw, but that's what makes them more interesting, real, and it drives the game further. They can't be perfect--that'd be boring.\n\nThe confusion you feel starting each route leaves you binging the game in order to get answers. The good endings of each route were very satisfying and the bad endings were FUN! Some of them are quite morbid, but good Lord, they're fun to see.\n\nThis game was an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, laughed, got a bit angry at certain characters for being absolutely psychotic... but, my God, let me tell you: the true ending for the 5th romanceable character was heartwrenching. I absolutely adored it, though. The \"true\" 5th route answers all of your questions and leaves you with a sense of \"Ah, I understand now!\" and it does not fall short of being satisfying.\n\nI really don't have much to analyze or go in depth over in this review. The game is just... yes.\nI highly recommend it if you like otome visual novels. It's a must play for the genre. Here's to hoping that they eventually localize the other Amnesia titles soon.

This one doesn't have any gratuitous nudity or sex scenes. Now that half of you have probably stopped reading I have to say this was an interesting game. This time you play a girl and have the option of getting to know 4 unique guys . I have to say the whole amnesia aspect was interesting. As you are interacting with each guy you have to recover your memories and the feelings you had for them while not letting them know you've lost your memories. \n\nI found myself invested in each story more than I'd ever care to admit. In such a way that you start to have favorites. The guys all have distinct personalities in how they act with you. Some are pushy, while others are cold and indifferent. As they warm up to you and get more familiar you find yourself warming up to them and you learn that they're not as heartless their initial personality. \n\nThere is an underlying mystery that includes one secret guy who you can only play out once you've finished the ending of each of the main 4. This is a little more scary as you will discover him in other play throughs and adds a bit of horror element to the game. There are 3 types of endings, good, normal and bad. Bad usually ends with your death and you'll see it coming once the music changes. And boy does that music send chills down your spine once it starts and you realize that something bad is going to happen you can't help but feel a bit of terror. \n\nWhile the entire game is spoken in Japanese there is an option to skip or fast forward a lot of the seen dialogue so subsequent playthroughs are quicker. And to get all the endings you're going to have to replay quite a bit. There's a bit of trial and error in balancing out your relationships and sometimes the choices you're presented with aren't so clear as to what outcome it will lead. Despite that I enjoyed the story and diverse personalities of the guys you date. You should play this if you are a fan of VNs otherwise without the sex and nudity I think it wouldn't be for everyone.", "timestamp_created": 1478398871, "timestamp_updated": 1478398871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556392", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26442867": {"recommendationid": "26442867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103496212", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508186542}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich kannte vorher den Anime \"Amnesia\" und habe ihn bereits geliebt.\nDas Spiel schuf das Fundament zu der wundersch\u00f6nen Animeserie und umfasst vier Geschichtsverl\u00e4ufe mit je vier verschiedenen Enden.\n\nDie Charaktere sind in einem sch\u00f6nen Anime-Zeichenstil gehalten und wirken alle \u00e4hnlich sympathisch, wenn man erst die Erz\u00e4hlstr\u00e4nge mitverfolgt.\nIch spielte zuerst nat\u00fcrlich erst die Storys um meine Favoriten und musste feststellen, dass es doch recht schwer ist, das gute Ende zu erhalten. \n\nDie Dialoge kann man gl\u00fccklicherweise auch beschleunigen, sodass man nicht alles so oft lesen muss. \nBeim Spielen werden die Bilder und Szenen in der Gallery gespeichert, sodass man sie auch sp\u00e4ter nochmals aufrufen kann.\n\nAll in all empfehle ich dieses Spiel jenen, die sowohl die Animeserie als auch Anime generell lieben und Visual Novels m\u00f6gen.\nDie Serie als auch das Spiel ist meiner Meinung nach eher f\u00fcr Frauen ausgelegt.

worth it.  It's really long.  I let it autoplay with all the voice acting and basically watched it like a video (while doing other things).  Used a guide to make all the choices to unlock the final route.\n\nThis is definitely one of those VNs where all of the datable guys are horrible people and yet the MC doesn't care at all.  I'm not sure there was a single guy I actually thought was an okay person in this game.  Spoilers: You've got the boy-next-door who's mean to you, the smart guy who's really condescending, the guy who seduces girls with his eyes but it's okay because he can't help it (strangely, also the least creepy and annoying one), and the guy who straight up kidnaps you and locks you in a cage.  And if you do the \"secret\" route, the guy who seems alright but has an alternate personality who's totally insane.  And your MC's just like, yeah, that's cool with me.

An interesting way to give meaning to the way you usually play these VNs over and over getting all the different endings, and the routes were quite different from one another unlike in some games.

It has pretty much everything in it; mystery, suspicion, supernatural, humor and of course, romance. It's a perfect mix of everything that interests me, so naturally it would be an instant hit with me. And it was. All of the routes are different, with varying dominant genres in them (one character is more focused on mystery, another on suspicion) and your relationships with the side characters change as well, depending on who you chose. So things change in every route enough to keep you interested, even in the similar settings.\n\nI LOVED almost every romanceable character and even the side characters! They're a group of colorful personalities, with good and bad characteristics. What I liked about this game is that despite seeing the good and the bad, I didn't hate any of the romanceable characters. They might have stereotypical personalities at first glance, but there's more to it, for all characters. They are not perfect, but I still loved them. Perhaps even more because of it. \n\nThe art is GORGEOUS. I liked the amount of color this game had, especially on the characters. The background stayed very mellow with extremely light colors, but it worked. The focus is more on the characters as it should be. The CGs are beautiful, but so is rest of the game.\n\nThe animation was a nice touch. I wouldn't have minded if they didn't have it, but it does make them more real. They don't just blink, their mouths move too. Combined with the incredible, emotional voice acting... I have no words. A tiny thing that I did notice was that the mouths might still move even if there's a pause in the voice, but I only just saw it, so I was fine with it.\n\nI haven't played that many otome games, but I have played enough to say that the gameplay was HARD. First of all, there's three different meters (affection, trust and suspicion) and you weren't informed what rose after a choice. And if you checked the parameters, you didn't necessarily see where the change happened. IF anything happened. It was really hard for me because I wanted to play without a guide, but I couldn't avoid it. I could reach a Normal End without a guide, but Good End was too difficult.\n\nDespite the last part, I full heartedly recommend this game. It's has an extremely interesting story, beautiful visuals, lovable male characters and likeable female ones, and amazing voice acting. I might have bought it on sale but if this game ever got a physical English release, I would buy it.

I loved the art, enjoyed several of the routes as well as the overall story. I think I only really liked 2 of the 5 possible guys to date but I still enjoyed the other ones as I was able to get the good end with all the routes. I also felt like this game was a good length as it took me around 40 hours just to get though all the good endings, which is well worth the money spent on this game. I still have a couple more hours to spend with this game as there are some other endings I would like to try to get as well as some extras. \n\nI don't think I have any major criticisms with this game to be honest. Sometimes the story can feel rather over the top but I found myself laughing at those bits rather then being annoyed by them. If there is one thing I would want to see changed in this game is to make it easier to skip to certain days as while I did save, I found it annoying having to skip  through so much text and I found it much difficult replaying certain routes..\n\nIf you can get this game on sale and are wanting to try out an Otome then I do recommend this one. \n\nOverall rating: 7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1477855043, "timestamp_updated": 1477855179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26318533": {"recommendationid": "26318533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120525652", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477686932}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is just fantastic.

Algo que siempre es m\u00e1s agradable que empezar el juego con una pantalla fija. Adem\u00e1s, en el men\u00fa inicial, da la opci\u00f3n de jugar a dos minijuegos sin necesidad de hacer nada para desbloquearlos. Y nunca en mi vida hab\u00eda disfrutado tanto el jugar a piedras, papel o tijera. Divertido, tanto que incluso se echa de menos alg\u00fan otro minijuego.\n\nLas cuatro opciones iniciales que da para escoger entre cuatro mundos, representan a los cuatro chicos. Pero hay sorpresa al acabar todas las rutas. Todas las historias son divertidas y algunas est\u00e1n de ellas est\u00e1n en parte ligadas pero no se hacen repetitivas al variar las rutas. Es m\u00e1s, te quedas alucinada con lo que llegas a descubrir sobre ellos al escoger su historia. \n\nLa m\u00fasica: agradable, para nada molesta o que no coincida con el momento; y las voces en japon\u00e9s (que no es tanto pedir!!!). Si nos ponemos un poco quiquillosos, podemos decir que la voz a veces no cuadra del todo con los movimientos de la boca. Pero es que es buscar fallos por buscar. No da una mala impresi\u00f3n.\n\nApartado gr\u00e1fico/art\u00edstico: Los fondos son m\u00e1s tenues, no parece que est\u00e9 pegada una imagen sobre otra. Cosa que ya he visto m\u00e1s veces de las que me gustar\u00eda en otros juegos. El color tiene degradados y en general da una impresi\u00f3n muy agradable que resalta m\u00e1s a los personajes. Los chicos, pues sin quejas, los dibujos son impresionantes. Las poses tambi\u00e9n var\u00edan. No est\u00e1s delante de una persona que siempre mantiene la misma pose. Se giran, dan la espalda, y adem\u00e1s los personajes PARPADEAN. Puede parecer una tonter\u00eda, pero es que cuando est\u00e1s mirando la pantalla y te quedas con ese detalle, te parece que lo tengas delante de verdad. La impresi\u00f3n que deja es muy buena. Los CG's impresionantes, 10 de 10. Y es que a nivel gr\u00e1fico, se pueden encontrar detalles que gusten m\u00e1s o menos, pero da la talla. Adem\u00e1s es curioso encontrar alguna referencia al juego de Moujuutsukai to oujisama -Beastmaster and prince- (un p\u00f3ster del pr\u00edncipe Lucia). Si no recuerdo mal es donde el cine.\n\nLa historia, creo que el propio nombre ya deja claro el tema, \u00bfno? Un recurso t\u00edpico de los mangas pero encuentro que el juego le da una vuelta m\u00e1s al introducir al personaje de Orion. Es tan KAWAII que te lo llevar\u00edas a casa. Adem\u00e1s los gestos que pone son divertidos y su voz muy agradable. Pero si quer\u00e9is saber mejor a qu\u00e9 me refiero, os aconsejo jugarlo. Porque es de los mejores otome que he jugado para PC.\n\n[b]Mi \u00fanico \"pero\" es respecto a la dificultad de saber si vas por el camino adecuado dentro de una ruta.[/b] En cuanto a las respuesta correctas para un buen final, a veces puedes sudar un poco para saber si vas bien o no.

Anyways, the artwork is beautiful, the backgrounds are so soft, and the music fits in so well with everything. Not only that though, at times it gets kinda creepy, in my opinion. I know, I know, I said I watched the anime, but it's not like I'll remember EVERYTHING... At those 'creepy' times though, it really does get my heart racing, and its a nice difference from other Otome that I play. I do wish that as the player, 'I'/ the heroine speaks more.

All the backgrounds are well made and the character models have a lot of detail. The character models in general are gorgeous, the clothes seem to have a marble-like texture and the eyes stand out. They even move from pose to pose during dialogue and blink.\n-The music keeps getting stuck in my head and is pleasant to listen to, there are quite a few different tracks to suit the different moods and they're also very well done.\n-All of the routes are very different from one another, so playing a new route isn't a 'oh, this again' experience excluding the prologue. I haven't played many otome aside from free to plays, but the routes here seem to be very unique. [spoiler] Never have I ever been locked in a dog cage by my boyfriend[/spoiler].\n-Gosh, do I love the characters. Maybe they wont all be everyone's cup of tea [spoiler]specifically Toma[/spoiler] but I found most the characters to be interesting and likeable.\n-Voice acting!!! I do love me some voice acting and Amnesia has it, professional voice acting even! I didn't find that any of the voice actors got annoying throughout my play, though I did find some voice actors to be better than others. Waka's voice actor specifically shone to me despite him being a side-characer.\n-There were a few mysterys here and there- heck, one of the routes is essentailly a murder mystery without the murder. I found them enjoyable enough and finding out things bit by bit feels like putting together a puzzle.\n-You can name your character whatever you want, which is nice.\n-Choices you've already picked are highlighted green when you play through again.\n\nNEGATIVES\n-As gorgeous as the character models are if they don't move for a while or if your making a tough desicion it feels like they're staring into your soul. Also the necks look a bit weird, specifically Shin's.\n-The same music tracks are used throughout ALL of the routes, so some of the more common everyday songs can be a bit boring after a while.\n-...[spoiler]Toma's route. Just. Toma's route. It can be very polarizing and off-putting, not mention how immoral it all is! I get some people are into that but honestly, Toma's the worst TuT[/spoiler]\n-Cheesy dialogue at times. I suppose that's common in otome though.\n-Rina, as I called her, doesn't have a voice. Maybe it's just me who's disappointed by that, but I found it a bit off-putting.\n-I experienced quite a bit of lag while playing, nothing game breaking but enough to make switching between screens and menus a bit irking.\n\nTIPS (some spoilers? maybe?)\n-Don't start with the diamond world. Any of the other three routes would be good to start with but I feel that the Dimond world gives away too much for the other worlds and is too polarizing for a first route.\n-Save at the end of the prologue when you're offered the choice of which world you want to go to, it saves time when you want to start a new route.\n-The 'S' button is the shortcut to skip dialogue you've already read, which is useful for trying to get different endings in routes you've already completed.\n-If you really want to wrap up the story you have to get the good ends in all four worlds[spoiler]which then unlocks the fifth world, Joker world[/spoiler].\n\n[spoiler]Kent is best route, Toma's route can burn, Orion is practically my son at this point and poor Ukyo deserves all the cookies- Enjoy.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1471050940, "timestamp_updated": 1471050940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500499", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24835725": {"recommendationid": "24835725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160719148", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471303395}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me ha gustado mucho este juego.

As far as otomes go, Amnesia: Memories is as much of an otome as you can get. Unfortunately this meant putting up with bland conversations, exasperating males, and a frustratingly bland protagonist. I'm forcing myself to play this for completion, but this is a long game. As of this review I've finished two routes.\n\nCharacter art: 9/10   } Very shiny, very pretty. All characters have lovely art, not just the husbandos.\n\nBackground art: 2/10   } Simple background designs that look like an architecture student finished half a blueprint and left.\n\nCGs: 7/10   } Good quality CGs, but I can't stop laughing at the noses haha.\n\nMusic: 5/10   } Standard VN music.\n\nWingman(s): 10/10   } Frankly speaking, Orion's the only reason why I didn't give up this game. You go, Orion!\n\nVoice acting: 8/10   } Probably the reason why the game costs so much. Good voice acting.\n\nRoute(s): 4/10   } Spoilers below for why.\n\n[SPOILERS START]\nIkki's route - good God I was just [i]waiting[/i] for this route to end. Ikki looks cool but is a broken record and completely unchanging. Early bad end incites rage, other early bad end feels like a horror game. The satisfaction of the good end barely outweighs the frustration of having to put up with him for the rest of the route.\nToma's route - I have no words for this. Toma's route is a topic that splits people into two clear parties. Sorry Toma, but that was too much.\n\nGet Amnesia: Memories while it's on sale, and enjoy your pure otome.", "timestamp_created": 1470611812, "timestamp_updated": 1470611812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24729716": {"recommendationid": "24729716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198177908866", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512894444}, "language": "english", "review": "X'D bro what great than ikeman otome game!

There was never a dull moment for me when playing this game, theres countless things to explore and many ways to play the game. Also, with each route, there will be a good ending, a normal ending and a bad ending (Sometimes theres more than just one bad ending, so be prepared) Not going to lie, sometimes I feel like the normal endings are just as terrible as the bad endings; You should definately strive for the good endings in all routes though. There's four guy's routes in the beginning, but if you stay until the end you'll be able to enter a special world and get a true ending! \nWhen I first started playing this game I was hopelessly obsessed, there's something like a magnetic attraction that charms and pulls you into all the little odds and ends of this game.. With each guy, there's different personality; you're bound to find the one you like. Within the four main routes, the heroine will experience different instances; some lovely, sympathetic, scary or even questionable.. Its all in how you want to interpret the many feelings of this game. Amnesia Memories is also a very humorous game, It's fun to see how things turn out in the end since choices really do matter. \nOverall, Amnesia Memories is a gem of a game, don't miss out.. Solid 10/10. If you're still contemplating on buying this game, be sure to have one to multiple boxes of tissues close by, you might just cry a river.

Amnesia is very atmospheric, and each character's route is unique, slowly completing the puzzle that is the MC's mysterious predicament.

There are now quite a few otome games available for the Western market, most of them developed by westerners themselves and in English. However for those of us that really want to play Japanese Otome, the offerings are still very few. Amnesia does not dissapoint, it is excellent and what we all expect. A couple of things *are* missing, for me at least: 1) a little more darkness (the anime had me on the edge of my seat with some characters that were evidently innocent in the game playthrough); 2) a little bit more sexiness to the game.

A few notes, from the perspective of someone unfamiliar with the genre:\n\nPROS:\n- Overall story and character development are generally well done\n- Interesting variance between the stories; some things remain fairly constant, other things... don't\n- Stylistic choices work well (minimalistic backgrounds, card game theme)\n- Artwork is reasonably good and use of it in key moments is well executed\n\nCONS:\n- Orion is basically Navi\n- Choices can feel very limited at times and the story gets a bit railroady in some places\n\nAlso keep the difficulty in mind - if you enjoy having to work for a good (or even a normal!) ending, you'll likely appreciate it, but if you get tilted by a bad ending, you might want to be wary.

I've been checking out some free games from NaNoReno challenges and let me tell you - storylines in some of the free stuff FAR surpass the scripts of paid content. But, Amnesia is a great story, great gameplay and great experience, and a benchmark I use against any new otome games I want to play. I got it last autumn when it initially went on the big -90% sale, and I believe you really should be on a look-out for it as it has been done again for the Summer Sale, and you could have snatched the title for mere 2 quid instead of paying over 22 pounds.\n\n[h1] ART STYLE[/h1] \nThe sprites are beautiful! And I really mean it when I say beautiful. Each guy is very distinctive, with their flair of style, set of clothes and colours. Supporting characters are unique as well, easily recognizable in each route. Even though some people complain about the backgrounds, I actually like the Photoshop, minimalist style of them - considering the careful design of characters, you'd get a headache if everything was just as detailed. Apart from that - expressions! The changing poses (although, I have to say this, most times Shin and Ikki look AWEFUL facing back, and some of Ikki's CGs look as if he was a different person altogether, with very wonky features. It's been a let-down for me, as I've seen art from later Amnesia games and he looked good in them, not only when facing front. Oh well, can't have Medusa eyes beautiful from all angles, right?). The change in lighting and colours is a very good touch as well, \"sunset setting\" is done really well, as well as when night comes around and the whole colour scheme of backgrounds changes. BEAUTIFUL.\n\n[h1] CHARACTERS[/h1] \nSo far I've found two of my favourites, and have been constantly replaying their routes, with Shin first and now Ikki settled as my fav, fav, FAV character for a long while. Each guy has their own problems, quirks and things you are going to learn about them only if pursuing them directly, I really like the setting of having separate worlds and interacting with recurring characters in different circumstances. For once, Ikki made a \"whatever\" impression on me outside of his own route but baby, in his own - GOLD, GOLD, GOLD SWEET BABY. \n\nAnd it's really satisfying [spoiler] to be able to call Toma  a pervert and have Ikki nearly fight him, too. #neverforget #cageisnotmysafespace [/spoiler] \n\n[h1] CHOICES[/h1] \nVisual novels rely mostly on your own control over the story, and I find the choices here pretty varied, and actually compelling. Endings are really good overall, although true ones could be potentially more romantic. BAD ENDS however, oh MAN. I LOVE THEM. THEY'RE SO SICK. Like, really, really bad. It's no \"oh man I'm lonely blah, blah\", it's actual shit going down, [spoiler] characters getting murdered, your memory not returning, backstabbing [/spoiler] , and other drama, Bad ends are actually one of the reasons I use Amnesia as a benchmark while judging other games - it's an art to make bad choices entertaining, and have people investigate all options. Some of them are hidden so well, I had to resort to Let's plays to even notice what pattern you should have taken to even start on their route of destruction The menu is really helpful to keep track of all those already opened, or still left to witness.\n\n[h1] ADDITIONAL CONTENT[/h1] \nThere are two mini-games within the main menu you can play, some of the CGs are interactive where you can hear more from the characters \"in that exact moment\" after poking them a lot, and there are so called \"Memories\" that I find most entertaining of this bunch. It's the defining moment in each route that you can replay to learn more about the guy in that highlighting moment, and it's really, really sweet! Only after completing the route do they open, I believe, and only after checking them out will you realize the normal playthrough kind of omits the stuff said without losing an ounce of the romance. Clever screenwriting, I have to say, because it is essentially cut content you only notice missing after having played a Memory.\n\n[h1] OVERALL[/h1] \nEven though the trope of an amnesiac MC is an overused trope, this was the first game for me with it (lucky me!) and so it did not feel straining to go through the motions and the journey of reclaiming them. Guys are awesome, choices do matter, your heroine is actually pretty well rounded for not having memories for much of the playthrough - what I mean, is that you learn from interactions with the guys how mostly independent and level-headed she's been up to her amnesia, which is really nice for a change. I am currently playing OZMAFIA!!, and let me tell you - the MC in Amnesia is a Terminator compared to the MC there, who is simply an idiot that goes rogue against your own choices, fair and square.\nAmnesia is much less frustrating in this regard, but I have not even fully unlocked a romance of OZMAFIA!! so yup, not gonna give up hope yet.\n\nAs said already, be on the lookout for promotions and discounts, as the premiere last year was a big success, and more high budget otomes have started appearing on Steam (OZMAFIA!! as one of the other key productions) ever since Amnesia got released. Rejoice, rejoice, dear otome brethren! Get on it if you want a really interesting story set in different worlds, AMAZING boyfriends (Ikki is the best, just put up with all the drama, and you'll see), CRAZY bad ends and really pretty artwork.\n\nNow I actually want to [spoiler] give Diamond World a spin now, even though I know all the spoilers craziness within, [/spoiler]  but I miss the edginess of Amnesia. It's a hilariously dark and frightening world the more you think about it, and the more you learn about their problems.

Originally made for Playstation Portable and later Playstation Vita; Amnesia game series were started in 2011 and it was well received primarily in Japan. Within a year or so, the franchise earned a notable fan base and a reputation all over the world as a high quality otome series with countless merchandise and many sequels. Here we have [i]Amnesia: Memories[/i], which is actually the 4th game in the series, yet it is consistent and well elaborated enough within its own self, so you don't necessarily have to play any other games to enjoy it.\n\nOur heroine is a college student whose life will take an unexpected and unexplainable turn with the appearance of a spirit called Orion. Apparently, Orion was pulled into our consciousness and merged with our heroine accidentally while he was travelling between worlds. As it may be significant to mention, Orion's merge into our mind pushed our former memories out and our heroine ended up with Amnesia! We have no idea about who we were supposed to be, what was our personality like, whom might be our friends etc. and we are stuck with a spirit only we can hear or see. Luckily, Orion is a good natured one and takes full responsibility of this accident, even agreeing to stay by our side until we can recover our memories and adapt into our life. By the way, it seems that we are surrounded by charming yet problematic gentlemen with interesting backstories whom are desperately in love with us and there is no reason that we shouldn't pursue the romance of our hearts... Will our heroine be able to find her memories and win the heart of her preferred gentleman while doing so?\n\nCheesy? Yeah, a bit. The storyline isn't terribly imaginative for our chosen romance options, but all their singular stories are relevantly intertwined on a bigger picture. Once you complete four different romance paths with good endings, you'll be allowed to explore a fifth path to take a glance on this bigger picture and discover the reasoning behind seemingly irrelevant plot holes in all other stories. By its ability to collect all different paths in a unified story consistency, the core story is amazing and surely refreshing in this genre. According to my own experience, a solid core story for the starting plot and the setting consistency always wins over pretty romanceable boys with not so interesting personality defects. Thus, the final story was my favorite. Our 4 primary romance, on the other hand, felt a bit rushed and hollow. Sure, the narrative is good, event correlation is amazing etc. but only one of our pretty boys felt like an actually likable sort for me. Then again, this is a matter of taste.\n\nAs the game starts, we are asked to choose between four different worlds, where our heroine and any other character connected to her will take a different incarnation and a difference in interrelation. Core liaisons between characters rarely change. In all worlds, we are a college student with psychology major who lives alone, works in a maid cafe named Meido no Hitsuji during the summer and has more or less similar kind of relationships with people around her. In each incarnation, our primary romance target changes though and we gain new opportunities to discover more about our pretty boys.\n\nArtworks are glamorous with a good amount of CGs used. Character designs are a bit flamboyant and exaggerated for my taste - like a Final Fantasy villain fashion show - but they are quite unique. All the boys are designed to be a symbolic representative of four French suits of a pack of cards: hearts (Shin), spades (Ikki), clubs (Kent) and diamonds (Toma) - Ukyo being the joker. That presents an Alice-like taste for the whole game: elegant yet uncanny. All characters are properly voice acted with suitable choices. Environment design might be called stylized, - pastel colored renderings of some basic drawings - but it wasn't really appealing or remarkable.\n\n5 romance paths with each their good and normal endings + a truck load of bad endings thanks to the world being a constant danger to you for some reason + extra memories and short story routes present you a nearly 50-60 hour experience, and this is by skipping already seen text. There is also a great amount of choice options within each path with a good cause - consequence relation presented. If you are not using a guide, I highly recommend for you to take frequent saves. When you are bored of all the drama, you can take a break by playing some mini-games too.\n\nFor any otome gamer, Amnesia is a good deal and goes into a decent sale like %90 twice in a year or so. Okay, I'm hushing myself now. It was already hard for me not to spoil the actual story in this review. I'm going away before I blabber about something.

Sometimes it was really painful.\n- the protagonist is irritatingly passive. She hardly ever speaks. She hardly ever reacts. And it's not like she is just a kuudere or dandere type. There are countless amount of moments when somebody asks a direct question to protagonist. You expect some choices to pop up, but \u2014 nothing. The one who asked a question answers to himself and makes conclusions about what do you think or feel without your responce. Then he makes a decision about what to do then. You, the player, just feel like a wordless dog.\n- the protagonist has no personality at all. Literally. I almost laughed out when one of the guys said something like: \"Now when I know what it's like to be with you I couldn't bear to lose you\".

Especially since so many people recommended this to me as one of the holy grails of otome games. I was very excited to try this game, but after my first playthrough I felt very confused and disappointed. So I tried another route, thinking that I just had a bad route on my first try. The second route I tried was even worse than the first. I did not like this game at all. Perhaps it was my incredibly high expectations for this game that made it such a large disappointment. But either way, the game was just not enjoyable at all.\n\nThe main problem I have with this game is the story and characters. The story is very cliche and the game sometimes moves at a painfully slow rate. The characters are so unrealistic and their actions and motives make absolutely no sense at all. Almost all of the guys are either egocentric jerks or literal psychopaths. They never apologize for their hurtful behavior. EVER. These men constantly hurt the protagonist and expect her to forgive them and welcome them with open arms without showing any remorse or guilt over their previous actions. The only way to get the \"good ends\" involve either forgiving them, submitting to them, apologising for things that are not your fault, or ignoring their behaviour. The routes I played just aggravated me. I hated the fact that these men treated me so poorly and I was just supposed to ignore it. This game would be great if the premise was to teach people what unhealthy abusive relationships look like. But unfortunately, that is not the case.\n\nThe protagonist has literally no personality at all. And I get that the character you play as often doesn't have as much depth as the characters you meet, but this was just ridiculous. The entire game you feel like Orion is controlling all of your emotions and thoughts-- because he pretty much is. This character has no thoughts. She simply has Orion to tell her his feelings and what HE thinks she should do in the situation. \n\nThis game was just bad. Each time I played it I became very anxious to just get it over with and finish it already. Then each time I ended a route, I felt even more annoyed than when I was playing because the endings were so awful and uneventful. It's very unfortunate that a game with such beautiful art and stellar voice acting would be cursed with such a bad plot and characters.

So far, I've done one route and thouroughly enjoyed it. I plan to do all the paths and if my views change, I'll edit this review.[/i]\n\n[h1]The Story[/h1]\nYou meet a spirit named Orion who now inhabits your consciousness, telling you that you must now choose which reality to go back to in order to regain your lost memories due to him accidentally shoving them out. You're then given four choices and sent into that world to meet your friends and those important to you to try and remember. Each path has a different story to it, which is actually pretty nice for a game like this. Much better than what you can end up with when it comes to this type of game.\n\nFrom what I understand, each path has a good ending, a normal ending, and one - two bad endings, so there's a lot to explore even after your first playthrough through a world, as the game calls them. Each of your datable boys is based off of a suit in cards. Hearts, Diamonds, Clovers, and Spades. Going through the story, you'll easily be able to tell which boy is which suit (and in turn which world).\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] The visuals in this game are stunning.\n[*] A bunch of unlockables throughout the game, as well as a way to keep track of them.\n[*] The music fits and is pleasing to listen to. It also fits with what's going on with the story.\n[*] Replayability (obviously)\n[*] Paths are distinct from one another and are a decent length each time through.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[*] The backgrounds tend to be a little drab compared to the drawings of the characters and the CGs.\n[*] If you don't like boys who tend to be a little rough, this isn't for you. (It's a cultural things since it's original Japanese which I can look past, but some may not be able to)\n[*] The characters can be hard to read, so it can be difficult to figure out the \"right\" choice.\n[*] Minor words repeated in some text boxes (because I know that bothers some people, especially when you're reading all of what's spoken)\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Ending Thoughts[/h1]\nIf you're a fan of the genre, I think you'll enjoy this. I had my doubts because of negative reviews that I read, but I thouroughly enjoyed this game. I'll definitely be trying to get all of the acheivements in it. I'm curious how all of the other stories will play out in the different worlds.\n\nThe price for this game at the time I bought it was $2.99 due to the summer sale, but I would definitely have bought it at full price if I had the funds to support Idea Factory.\n\n[h1]Ending Score:[/h1] [b]8/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1467566340, "timestamp_updated": 1467963898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24053442": {"recommendationid": "24053442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068985058", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2021, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469745737}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is crazy addictive!

This creates a much better understanding of some of the incomprehensible social decisions several of the characters make, and the main character's extreme lack of characterization until she interacts with everyone more. Best Artificial Intelligence. Clearly, the fairy is only there as a navigational system for the AI's judgment calls.\n\nIt has a lot of things going for it...and a lot of things completely not. As one of the initial otome games to be released stateside, I was eager to support more of a genre coming out and bought it the day of its release.\n\nI'll try to encapsulate the pros and cons as succinctly as possible.\n\nPROS:\n- You play the cutest character in the game (or maybe that's not a pro)\n- The game itself clearly thinks succumbing to the whims of a creepy stalking and controlling boyfriend is a bad idea, and tells you so if you actually get a certain character's good ending by questioning your taste.\n- It's another otome in the market that's fun, even if it isn't stellar.\n- The final route is pretty damn fun.\n- Shin is probably one of the most refreshingly sensible characters I've seen in a visual novel when it comes to using his brain. I just wish he didn't look like a Hot Topic victim, though if he was the only one who did, it would make more sense as a style choice? Everyone dressing this way was pretty bizarre.\n- Ukyo.\n- I can only assume that every single character in this is secretly a cyborg trying to pass as a human, given their eyes.\n- Has one of the most healthy relationships I've seen in the Clover route, though it's also one of the most boring routes to me ever. I would've much preferred it if the Clover route had more of a murder mystery going for it, with Ken being extremely helpful and aiding the character or...something. I dunno, that route REALLY NEEDS SOMETHING, but it still gets in the PRO section due to the rarity of a sane relationship in otome games.\n\nCONS:\n- TOMA. \n- TOMA.\n- A lot of Ukyo's appearances are less intriguing than intended, even if I get the intention behind the portrayal, it's still a bit of a failure.\n- Some of the style choices of the artwork itself is ridiculous, such as proportions and the like at certain angles. This is a preference thing and I probably wouldn't notice it as much if the men didn't look designed for the next Hot Topic Barbie Contest.\n- Most of the routes are really, really, really uninteresting for me. \n\nUltimately I think a lot of people will love Amnesia...and a lot of people really won't. Ultimately, I recommend going for better visual novels, or better otomes, if that particular subgenre is what you're searching for. \n\nBetter Otomes in particular: Sweet Fuse for the PSP, Nameless on Steam, Hakuoki on PS3, VITA or PSP.\nBetter Visual Novels in general: Any visual novel with an interesting plot like Fate/Stay Night, Fruit of Grisaia (from what I've played; Haven't completed this one yet), or Nameless.", "timestamp_created": 1467049580, "timestamp_updated": 1467049580, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567186", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23864675": {"recommendationid": "23864675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076603357", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1088, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472503610}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

I would not let impressionable, young audiences play it.\n\nI should start by saying that the reason I bought this game is because I watched the anime (which is based off this game) and I thought it would be interesting to see the different adaptations and interpretations. I think watching the anime can give you a good idea of what to expect in the most extreme paths (Diamond/Joker worlds). \n\nIn the game, each path leads to a full story, which makes it a lot easier to understand. The main character is still passive, which was the main complaint people had about the anime. Not every path leads to a healthy, happy relationship. I don't think anyone should play this game with the expectation of using it as reference for real life romance. That said, the CGs and voice acting are amazing. I also enjoyed the mini games, even if they're a bit buggy. \n\nThe general storyline/world building is not that great, but I didn't buy an otome game expecting to get the next Game of Thrones. What's important is the special scenes and those were really nicely written. I managed to laugh and be torn in quite a few of them. \n\nMy advice: if you want a mild, happy romance, this is not it (unless you stick to the clover world). Watch the anime first, then figure out if the themes are something you're ok with.

Maybe it's not worth $30 (i got it for $3), but a very solid otome game nonetheless (i would buy it for 10-20 bucks). It took me about 4 hours to finish 1 of the paths and there are ~3 paths for each character. it took me 17 hours to finish all the paths for one character plus all the minigames ( this includes me leaving the game open and forgetting to pick choices for minutes on end).  If youre like me and keep going back into the game to see all the endings, you should save the game right before you pick the worlds while youre in the dream world, so you dont need to keep going through the intro everytime you go back to pick a character or redo a route. \n\n(I'll edit this review after i finish the game and all achievements)\n\nTL;DR pretty cool game. Has it's bugs and can be contradicting. Choices dont really translate well so they seem similar. if you keep playing for all endings can get boring and repetative, however picking different chocies can lead to long interesting scenes which can ease your boredom when replaying. imo not as good as the ones you can get on your phone. (be my princess, thief x, My forged wedding, etc...)\n\nPros\n--- Cute story\n\n--- The routes, though they have similar aspects to keep the story going, all have different flows depending on the path you take so its not too repetitive like other otome games i've played. \n\n--- Nice art\n\n--- The choices are good and things I would actually say\n\n--- No misunderstanding in the choices (example. if the choice is 'I wanna go with you...' it wont turn into a i wanna go with you, but *some excuse why you actually dont want to*. It really will be I wanna go with you...)\n\n--- Voices\n\n--- You are the main character. Since she lost her memories and such you pretty much are her and what you think are her thoughts. Orion makes up for some things by being the voice only you can hear which is also nice.\n\nCons\n--- slow start\n\n--- Price (30 bucks is just too much for an otome game imo, but it really is well developed so if youre okay with paying this much go for it. it is worth it)\n\n--- All voice acting is in Japanese. i was okay with it, but others may not be\n\n--- Game crashes when you try to adjust the size of the window (sometimes)\n\n--- You cant alt+tab to change (you can alt+enter, but it just makes it windowed and it bothered me a bit)\n\n--- Had to be windowed in order to exit game (no button/option to exit)\n\nBoth\n--- MC doesnt do much all talking is done by other character\n                     I dont like this because i would like to have some characterization on the girl, but i do like it because it makes me feel more like i am the character in the game.\n\n--- Even though the story is good i noticed some places where it wasnt very consistent. It would be like they forgot the choice you made earlier or just ignore it all together. Not too big of a deal though.\n\n---you sometimes get similar options (yeah or yes) i was okay with this but i read reviews where others disliked this. In japan there are formal ways to speak to people and informal, so the yeah would be informal and yes would be formal. It made sense, but i understand wanting variety\n\n--- sometimes you only get one option. This is because the options come up when the MC needs to talk or make any decision (which is understandable). this doesnt happen too often and usually only after making a 2/3 option decision.", "timestamp_created": 1466935237, "timestamp_updated": 1471846723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23818445": {"recommendationid": "23818445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168552564", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466925286}, "language": "english", "review": "I've never been more bored by a game. \nI've played way better Dating sims for free.", "timestamp_created": 1466925421, "timestamp_updated": 1466925421, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.366835", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23813144": {"recommendationid": "23813144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130243141", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505361205}, "language": "schinese", "review": "KENT!\nKENT!\nKENT!\n[Run", "timestamp_created": 1466910270, "timestamp_updated": 1466910270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23808920": {"recommendationid": "23808920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066648417", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466898535}, "language": "english", "review": "I really had high hopes because of the high reviews, but I was very disappointed, and relieved I bought it on sale.\n\nPros :\n- Nice art\n- Nice voice acting\n\nCons :\n- Everything else\n\nAs most bad reviews have pointed (should've read them before buying), the main character is very passive, rarely gets to speak and the choices barely matter. I only played part-way into the Toma storyline at the moment I am writing this review, but found it very distrubing. You just lost your memories and if they don't come back within 3 days, the caring friend he seems to be is supposed to take you back at the hospital. However, he doesn't seem to even bother checking if your memories have improved. He is very creepy very early on and so are most other characters you meet. I mean, eveyone in this game is a psycho, or have major issues, and you're suppoed to be okay with being basically the prisoner of your \"boyfriend\" who \"will try to control himself\" and not abuse of you. And you're supposed to be grateful and see him as your knight in shining armor. I mean, if you go out without his permission, he gets mad and you're supposed to feel bad.  it is the most boring thing ever, and so unromantic. It's so boring and unromantic, plus the main character is so submissive and lets Orion do all the talk - and does he ever shut up...\n\nMaybe some people like this kind of controlling relationship, I know I don't.

As it centres around a girl who has amnesia and sets out to remember her past without letting others suspect her of her memory loss. It has a mystery plot with a twist [spoiler] which you\u2019ll find out once you get to the joker route.\t[/spoiler]  At that point it will start to make sense and it eventually comes to a nice conclusion.\n\nCharacters- you have your clich\u00e9 love interests, the tsundere, the emotionless smart guy, the playboy, the yandere and the\u2026I\u2019ll leave the last guys personality up in the air, as he\u2019s my favourite character and it\u2019s best to discover what he\u2019s like as you progress through the story. Furthermore each hero is unique and different enough to keep you interested. Side characters such as Mine and the manager seem to have a different personality depending on the route which keeps you guessing there motive and whether they want to hurt you or befriend you.\n\nThe soundtrack and voice acting is superb. \n\nAt times their may have been moments where I wanted to scream at the heroine [spoiler] especially during Tomas route\t[/spoiler] but I endured through them so I could get to the Joker route and get the good ending in that, I did not regret it one bit.\n\nOverall I recommend this visual novel to those who are fans of the genre, want to get into visual novels or simply want something more and better than its anime adaption. \n", "timestamp_created": 1466558851, "timestamp_updated": 1466558851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23693124": {"recommendationid": "23693124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139202047", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468682671}, "language": "english", "review": "Okey, I LOVE THIS GAME!

Since this game is nothing but story, I'll try to keep it spoiler-free.\n\n(Side-note: This visual novel has an anime! It's crap compared to the game though, so I don't recommend that)\n\nOverall Positive Features:\n\nStory - This is the most important part of the game, so respectfully it's the best part. There are five arcs to this game, each pertaining to one of the five main male characters. Even if you aren't the biggest fan of the main male character to the arc, the heroine's relationship to him is generally not the only focus of the story, so it's still enjoyable.\n\nJapanese Voice-acting - the voice acting work of this game is well-done; character voices fit the personalities appropriately, and nobody sounds like an emotionless brick unless they're supposed to.\n\nCharacter art and CGs - The design of the characters and the CGs are really nice in my opinion- even if you're really stingy about art, the designs are at the very least tolerable.\n\nMusic - The soundtrack of this game is fantastic and fits the mood extremely well. The song for the opening movie also has a lot of hype, I love it.\n\nThings You May Find Iffy:\n\nOrion - Orion is a character that is with you throughout the entire game and provides commentary on what's happening around you for the majority of the game. He's also extremely important to the plot, so even if you don't like him, you're stuck with him. Personally I like Orion, but his constant presence can be annoying to players. Since you can't 'disable' him, it can ruin the game for you if you don't like him.\n\nBackground Art - I'll level with you. There's only like three or four colors along with some gradient in them most of the time, excluding white. I personally don't mind this since it allows me to focus on the characters in front of me rather than being distracted by a super-detailed background, but you may find it a bit too washed-out for your taste (check the screenshots on the store page to see if you like it or not).\n\nBonus:\n\nEndings - This game has A LOT of endings. Every arc has at least four endings: The good ending, the normal ending, and at least two bad endings, with a total of 26 endings.\n\nMemories & Extras - Okay, so at some point, you will unlock the item \"Memories\" for the main menu. The Memories are little bonus scenes where the heroine spends time with that character at some point during the story. Next, there's the item \"Extras\" which you also unlock at some point for the main menu. These are basically silent thoughts from the main male of a particular arc. And by silent, I mean there isn't any voice acting, it's pretty much just pure reading.\n\nCG Voice Clips: As you unlock CGs, you can review them in the gallery, which is pretty standard. Certain CGs (that is, CGs with a little red rose in the corner of the preview) will play voice clips when you ctrl + left click certain areas with about five different voice clips to each CG (this includes alternate versions of that CG, by the way). While it's a nice feature, looking for these things becomes a clicking hunt as there is no indication that you can actually click there (and for shorter voice clips, you're sometimes supposed to click on an area multiple times).\n\nMini-Games: Okay, now this is kind of silly, but this game has it's own version of rock-paper-scissors and air hockey. Rock-paper-scissors got turned into a reflex game where you have to \"attack\" if you win so you get a point, or \"defend\" if you lose so they don't get a point. Air hockey is, well, air hockey. You can play against the five main guys as kind of varying levels of difficulty, and you get an achievement for beating them all. The moral of this story is that if you're getting frustrated at one of the guys, you can just beat them at air hockey and rock-paper-scissors.\n\nMy Final Thoughts:\n\nOverall I think this game is fantastic and while it's definitely not an experience meant for everybody (the heroine having a romantic relationship with one of five guys should have made that obvious) I personally believe that the story is enjoyable to anyone who enjoys romance (I do suggest however that if you're not of the intended audience you should just look up a walkthrough of this game, and again, don't even bother with the anime).", "timestamp_created": 1463726270, "timestamp_updated": 1479965743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502316", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23092889": {"recommendationid": "23092889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202572485", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507250660}, "language": "english", "review": "I did Toma's world last, and now I can't see him the same way again.

Maybe at a wall instead? Or....perhaps, do you squeeze the juice out and make lemonade? The possibilities are pretty much endless. Excuse me for my silly segue, but in an odd way Amnesia: Memories reminds us that life is full of possibilities - so, which will you take?\n\n[h1]The Breakdown[/h1]\nAmnesia (no, not the horror game that exploded in popularity on YouTube a few years back!) is a Japanese visual novel developed and published by Idea Factory under their \"Otomate\" brand. Now, if you're not familiar with the term \"otome\", that usually refers to visual novels with a female main character that dates males. If you don't recognize the term \"visual novel\", it's basically what it sounds like: a novel of sorts with accompanying visuals. \n\nThe gameplay in Amnesia involves choices quite often, so it's more of a choose your own adventure sort of deal instead of just walls of text. Personally, I really liked this approach because the game has a lot of endings (20+), especially bad ones. The differences between \"good\" and \"normal\" endings are usually somewhat minor, but the difference between a \"good\" and a \"bad\" ending is huge - usually bad endings result in death, I was really surprised to see this from a visual novel, especially one about dating pretty dudes. Sure, a lot of the bad endings are silly, but some of them were genuinely creepy. The dark aspects hiding under the game's innocent front were a little surprising to say the least.\n\nWhat truly surprised me though was the game's characters, especially the main 5 \"dateable\" guys. At the start of the game, you're given a choice between 4 worlds (Heart, Spade, Clover, Diamond), each of which has a main dude to focus on. Sure, in most of the worlds nearly all of the main cast is present (which includes coworkers, occasionally family members, and the extra friend or two), but clearly the male lead is what the game wants you to focus on. However, nearly all of the characters in this game are pretty interesting, from the bizarre manager at work to the mysterious Ukyo, the 5th unlockable \"true ending\" guy. There were a few exceptions, but I think that all comes down to personal preference in the end. Personally I didn't care for Shin or Ikki's routes much, while Kent (my favorite), Toma, and Ukyo all had pretty interesting routes with some nice twists and turns along the way. \n\nI loved Kent's route in particular because it was great to see him develop as a character along the way; he goes from being a serious, rational, analytical type of person with seemingly no emotions to someone who is very sweet and caring. Most of the main dudes also develop along their routes, but just to clarify - it doesn't ever really feel like the game is overly mushy-gushy or stereotypical for visual novels. The dialogue is cleverly written and it helps to make the experience quite enjoyable.\n\nWell, mostly at least. There was one character in particular that bugged me to no end: Orion. \"Who the hell is that?\" you might ask. Well, he's the little guy who caused you to have amnesia in the first place. He's a spirit that follows you around everywhere, and I think he seriously could have been handled a bit better. Orion [i]loves[/i] to state the obvious, and he does so at every occasion. I think the entire game's length could be shrunk by an hour or two if Orion talked less honestly, though some of his dialogue is pretty important so I think he's still a fairly worthwhile addition to the cast.\n\nDespite that gripe though, I really enjoyed my time with Amnesia. The visuals are lovely and the music is a good mix between emotionally stirring melodies and casual background tunes. Whether you're a secret anime boyfriend harem lover, a fan of visual novels, or even just someone that enjoys solid writing, I think Amnesia is certainly a great experience.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Superb writing, dialogue, and characters\n[*]20+ endings, many of which are bad ones that may or may not result in death\n[*]4 dateable dudes with an extra mysterious 5th unlockable one\n[*]Takes about 20-30 hours to get all the endings (about 3-5 hours for each route), depending on how fast you read and how well you manage save files\n[*]Lovely music + visuals\n[*]Japanese voice acting\n[*]Steam achievements, trading cards, and Cloud support\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Orion (the reason you have amnesia in the first place) can be annoying at times - he talks way too much and his voice isn't exactly easy on the ears after hours and hours of listening to him\n[*]The outfits of the males (and 1 female) are a little ridiculous.....oh, who am I kidding? This is such a minor complaint. Just go play the game!\n[/list]\n\nAmnesia: Memories isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn excellent. For fans of otome (girls x guys) visual novels, anime, or just reading in general, this is an absolutely great game that shouldn't be missed!\n\n\n\n\nOh, and Kent is the best.

This is the story of Amnesia: memories.[/i]\n\n[h1]Introduction[/h1]\n\nWhat if you have an accident and forget everything of the past months? What would you do? How would we start again? When you wake up there's no friends or family at that moment. But maybe you don't wake up in a familiar place but at another dimension. Then you meet someone who wants to help,a spirit - he said, called Orion. He explains what's going on, he's attached to your soul and also, he's gonna help you to recover your memories. And at the end, he gives you a choice, to back to your world. Which one? Several, infinite dimensions, but you have five. Just pick one, and the adventure begins.\n\nIf you love anime you'll love Amnesia: memories. Personally , I'm not a big anime fan but I use to watch some. And believe me, is even better than just watching a series. Here you are part of the story, in a sort of \"choose your own adventure\" with the condiment of romance and many other things. Things about life after all, and you won't regret to explore every way of choices ahead. Just be careful in what you say or do, things could be good or wrong. You are advised!\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nHere you play with a girl, and you can choose her name. Personally, I'd love to play as a boy too but I think the game was conceived for visual novel fan girls. When I told you about the five worlds, that's because every world has a male main character and you will see the rest as secondaries. The worlds have a unique history and several endings, some sad, some great and some... spoilers!\n\nHow the game works? basically, you'll have several dialogues, and you Orion, this spirit will help you telling what to do, sometimes Orion could be a little bit irritating sometimes, but he is constantly helping us. Of course, he has his own opinions about what's going on around us. \n\nOld memories are lost but they will come, you have to achieve that, of course, will depend on wich path you follow and how you act with the people around your character.  This is the story of a girl, maybe many girls in many universes with different situations.\n\nThis game has something I don't use to see a lot, even in graphic adventures which I love to play: the voices. Every character has a unique voice and shows perfect their nature, along with the great storyboard that makes this game a jewel in the genre of visual novels. \n\nMusic and graphics: lovely, they are so anime(ish), and all ambience, music, art concept, it's great. I repeat, a jewel in many aspects this game Amnesia: memories.\n\n[h1]Extra Issues and final thoughts[/h1]\n\nAbout playing... I advise you to save the game when you have the chance of pick one of the five worlds, so you can skip the whole conversation with Orion at the beginning wich is a little long for my taste. Also, save just in case, there are several save slots, use them! So you can go back just in case and let's see what happen if you pick a different dialogue option.\n\nAs an extra there are minigames you can play at the introduction, and also you have steam achievements to get.\n\nThanks for this game, it's really just awesome, maybe on of the best visual novels. Is like reading a book, but with choices, something very immersive. I'm sure you will enjoy playing Amnesia: Memories.\n\nThanks to the developers for such great game!", "timestamp_created": 1463451759, "timestamp_updated": 1463463416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521801", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23022323": {"recommendationid": "23022323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165536927", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466454908}, "language": "english", "review": "I was annoyed with Orion, but overall I love this game. Orion annoyed me so much, I finally muted the game so I didn't have to hear his voice (right clicked volume in taskbar, opened volume mixer, muted game... in case anyone else wants to). I also wish there was a way to ONLY skip over Orion's dialogue, because all he really does is point out the obvious, and reiterate what we've already learned. He also asks questions that annoyed me, like \"why is he acting different suddenly?\" and I would heckel him the ENTIRE time, asking if he's even paying attention to the story or the datable males. If he asks a question requiring a response, the scroll wheel works to see what the question was when the options pop up.\nI did experience the weird screen glitch where some green writing would be displayed for a split second, but it didn't bother me because it was so fast.\n\nI finished this game in a matter of days (two, I think?). I stayed up after midnight just to finish one storyline. Each character took a few hours to finish, even if I was skipping through already read dialogue the second and third time around (this is with saves corresponding to a walkthrough). I got every ending, though I'm still missing a couple of pictures in the album. Each character has his endearing qualities, and not-so-endearing qualities, and each ending left me either disappointed or flying high.

I wasn't really eager to play this at first but I wanted to get a better impression of everything \"Amnesia\" - related after watching the dissapointing anime. When it was on steam sale I couldn't resist... So... here I am, writing a review about - what I call - a freaking amazing visual novel. \n\nNot only was the story intruiging, well-written, dark, yet romantic, but also mysterious, no, the art is also marvellous and beautiful. I can't really describe with words just how much I enjoyed it up til now. And don't get me started on the voice acting... There aren't all that many things to nitpick on... if you could really call it that.\n\nThe minigames were sweet and funny but nothing groundbreaking. I mean... it's a nice feature but it didn't do much for the visual novel. Even more so storywise. I mean... there was about one situation when those minigames also were mentionned within the story ... but there wasn't more to it. But it's okay...\n\nI'd totally recommend it.

For two reasons. The first one (being a bit of a negative) is at least for me it seemed a bit too easy to get the \u201cbad endings\u201d with most (if not all) of the guys in question which made it a bit hard to carry on when you get invested in a character to basically be in full tears and just want to lay on the floor for hours like human trash. However at the same time this is a POSITIVE partly because it means you can get into the story that is unfolding enjoy to feel those endings and just to hate yourself and what causes said events to happen.\n\nThe seconds reason (which is a big positive) I like how they connect everything. By this I mean the characters and the stories all at once. (not going to go into detail because spoilers) Also all not only do each of the dateable guys seem to have completely different personalities and likes so do the outside characters such as friends and co-workers. Which really gives it a nice touch since it doesn\u2019t feel like you're just interacting with Guy A or Guy B. When you talk to someone like Kent it\u2019s different talking to him as it would if you were talking to someone like Ikki. \n\nThe only other \u201cNegative\u201d that came up for me would be that Orion can get on my nerves. I think this is because after going after the same guy for roughly the fourth time in an attempt to get the good ending you kind of want to strangle him when you sits there just recapping what happened not even three minutes ago in game.\n\nOverall though I deeply enjoyed this game, yes it has some rather adult themes and dark scenarios but I rather enjoyed it since some of them catch you off guard and end up adding something to the story and even making you re-think about some of the characters you meet when you go down different paths.\n", "timestamp_created": 1463215773, "timestamp_updated": 1463215773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501156", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22969457": {"recommendationid": "22969457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152003792", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498645837}, "language": "english", "review": "11/10 would stick my dick in Shin again.", "timestamp_created": 1463204225, "timestamp_updated": 1463204225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502596", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22963542": {"recommendationid": "22963542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007282774", "num_games_owned": 484, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2591, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447855496}, "language": "english", "review": "I must say that this is the first otome that I bought and I don't regret it at all.

La presenza di Orion ha fatto perdere alla protagonista tutti i propri ricordi, fatta eccezione per il senso comune e per i ricordi legati alle sue funzioni vitali - come si mangia, come si dorme, come si respira.\nLa ragazza, per sopravvivere, deve subito attraversare una delle quattro [spoiler]o cinque[/spoiler] porte che si ritrova davanti: ognuna la condurr\u00e0 in un diverso mondo, dove dovr\u00e0 interagire con le persone che la circondano e cercare cos\u00ec di rievocare i propri ricordi perduti. Non pu\u00f2 tuttavia andare in un ospedale (restare inattiva e lontana da tutti peggiorerebbe le sue condizioni), inoltre deve fare attenzione a non rivelare la verit\u00e0 sulla propria amnesia alla persona sbagliata, se non vuole rischiare che questa cerchi di approfittare della sua situazione.\n\nParlando del gioco in s\u00e9, l'ho trovato davvero molto godibile.

Mi \u00e8 piaciuto moltissimo il fatto che non ci sia una narrazione di ci\u00f2 che succede, ma solo i dialoghi dei vari personaggi (con audio in giapponese), oltre a quello di Orion che, per quanto sia il personaggio che parla di pi\u00f9 in tutto il gioco, non ho mai sentito come una presenza fastidiosa o pesante, come invece succede di solito con i personaggi del suo stesso genere. Ho apprezzato molto di pi\u00f9 i design dei personaggi nel corso del gioco rispetto ai CG, ma questa \u00e8 tutta una questione di gusti personali.\nSe cercate degli avvertimenti pi\u00f9 specifici per ci\u00f2 che potreste trovare nel gioco, li scrivo qui sotto come spoiler.\n[spoiler]Oltre a una quantit\u00e0 abbondante di momenti romantici e adorabili, nel gioco ci sono anche minacce di morte, assassinii pi\u00f9 o meno espliciti e pi\u00f9 o meno riusciti, cooldere, yandere, casi di sdoppiamento di personalit\u00e0, possessione, elementi fantasy e tanto, TANTO drama.[/spoiler]\n\n\u00c8 un gioco che consiglio in generale, sia agli amanti del genere che a chi non ha mai preso in mano nessun videogioco come questo prima d'ora. Le good ending non sono troppo facili da ottenere e a ogni lieto fine corrisponde una buona quantit\u00e0 di bad ending in cui si rischia di incappare: posso dire che il gioco non si lascia concludere con facilit\u00e0, ma proprio per questo mi ha dato un'impressione ancora migliore.", "timestamp_created": 1462886581, "timestamp_updated": 1462886581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22884007": {"recommendationid": "22884007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032797211", "num_games_owned": 469, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467157838}, "language": "english", "review": "May have a short amount of time cause I just started it but I already love it.

However, certain storylines were compelling enough to make me continue regardless. In particular, I enjoyed the Heart, Diamond & Joker worlds. The characters, while nothing I haven't seen before, were fun & enjoyable, & all had their own unique personalities. I also liked that you're only romancing one boy per world, so there's no half-hearted romances with the other characters. The art style, as in the anime, in gorgeous, & I personally enjoyed the ability to skip dialogue you've already seen until you get to a choice or new content, which makes the inevitable repeated playthroughs much less tedious.\n\nOverall, I recommend Amnesia: Memories for anyone who enjoys narrative-driven visual novels & gamers who are curious about the growing trend.

So I don't really have any complaints in that regard.\n\nAmnesia is a fantastic mystery-oriented, somewhat dark romance dating sim. You play as a heroine who wakes up with amnesia and you must try to hide your amnesia. This concept works really well because you as the player don't have any idea what's going on with the heroine's life. All the characters have their own charm and they're not stereotypical or flat. The UI is super smooth, the art is gorgeous, the music suits the mood and doesn't get too repetitive, and the voice acting...-it's really good. I got this game on sale and I felt like it was a great catch. This game made me question my choices and I actually learned a bit more about myself and how I would react in certain touchy situations.\n\nIndividual route reviews! Characters completed so far: CONTAINS SPOILERS \n\n[b]Toma:[/b] Toma was the first one I chose, and yeah, many people find his to be the most shocking route. In fact, I got the bad end as my first playthrough, ahaha. I find it diificult to like or dislike him. I...am aware of the fact that's he not quite right in the head, but...I'm ashamed to say that I really like Toma. Since he's not real, he's not a threat to my well-being. Although if he were real then I'd stay far away. But I was beside myself with mixed emotions when I did the happy end. Toma is a really pitiful character, his pain makes me feel sorry for him and I wish I could help him, so I guess the happy end did work out for me in the end, although some people might disagree. Overall, I actually like Toma (though a part of me is fighting it).\n\n[b]Shin:[/b] the second character I decided to play. He has a really harsh personality, and he's younger than you, which makes him act even more harsh and independent because he wants to be on equal footing with you. He's pretty much the opposite of Toma; bitter on the outside, sweet on the inside. He does have a lot of swoon-worthy qualities, such as his sense of honor and his sudden kisses, and his bass playing in secret so he could surprise you and join your band, and he's also very human because he does have his weaknesses. It's easy to see why he's the featured character for the game. I remember his happy end made me cry because it was really sweet. Personally, his harsh personality isn't my type but he's a pretty likeable character.\n\n[b]Kent:[/b] by far the biggest surprise for me. He is introduced as a very stoic graduate student who loves to disagree and argue with you. He's also very blunt and can say insensitive things. BUT. Kent is a very innocent and sweet character (once you get to know him later, of course). Having no experience in romance, he's extremely cute and honest. I do find his personality rather rare if not unrealistic. I absolutely loved his happy end (and I got it on my first try too). If you thought Shin's happy end was sweet, Kent's happy end was ten times as sweet. He's also the only one (I know, so far) that knows and believes Orion.\n\n[b]Ikki:[/b] this is your playboy character. He's surrounded by fangirls and I initially thought it would be similar to Toma's route, but nope. The bullying was way worse in Toma's route. Ikki really isn't my type. He's sincere with you, so it's a matter of getting your character to trust Ikki. There were some quirks in Ikki's personality that I was surprised by...like how fragile he actually is (but not as fragile as Toma). He's also not very perceptive, unlike Shin and Toma who were super sharp and figured out you had amnesia on day 1 (Ikki finds out on the last day...gg). I thought the story would delve deeper into why Ikki wanted you to fall in love with him within 3 months (I thought it had something to do with breaking the spell put on his eyes, but I guess not). Overall, I found that it was pretty enjoyable, he's a smooth talker but I can never put much value on his words and I had a hard time seeing a logical progression of feelings. It could be just me, though.\n\n[b]Ukyo:[/b] poor crybaby Ukyo, I cried too.\n\nAfter all that, I can't decide who I liked best. I know Ikki comes in last (sorry Ikki fans), just because he wasn't my type. If you had to twist my arm and make me choose, I'll probably go for Toma...even though he's disliked for various reasons. ^^\n\nSome minor complaints I have is that some scenarios aren't really consistent. It seems like only the good end route is the route that's completely consistent, while in the other routes the game seems to forget some details based on the choices you make. I also am not too fond of rereading the same text 4 times to get all the endings since there isn't too much variation in the story except for the end, but most VNs are like that. I also don't like rereading the prologue 50 times because it really doesn't add to the reading experience each time, I'd suggest adding a skip option for the prologue so the player can just get on with it.  It also bothers me that the lip flap movements don't sync up with the voice acting, especially when the speech is being dragged out (I'm looking at you, Toma's seiyuu), but it's easy to ignore if you're reading the text most of the time. I really love the character art, but when the characters look surprised, they actually look like they're terrified...but these are all pretty minor flaws.\n\nOverall, this game is fantastic and I would definitely recommend playing if you're into dark romance dating sims!", "timestamp_created": 1462472593, "timestamp_updated": 1470533409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22813544": {"recommendationid": "22813544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119712102", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467342183}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "This game is reaaaaaaly amazing so far, i'm in love with shin's world, its really worth it. <3", "timestamp_created": 1462467632, "timestamp_updated": 1462467632, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22804819": {"recommendationid": "22804819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260945221", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462395478}, "language": "english", "review": "Through out playing this game I frequently said to myself, \"Yo WHAT is even going OOOOOON,\" but then I realized that the MC has amnesia and the frustration I was feeling at being so confused was actually similar to what she would be feeling, so mad props for that.

Unlike other otome games, this story changes radically depending on what answers you take and what man you go for. It's nice to know I can pay full attention to the game after just one guy, unlike others where sometimes picking someone different just changes maybe about three or four scenes tops and it's all the same the rest of the time.\n\nThe only thing is that it's hard to get a handle on the guy at first, though considering you don't know him it fits the story, but it's also terribly hard to know which action will please him. Spoiler: Going with what you think Kent wants to hear will win you no points, but being very affectionate despite that being clearly stated rouses his suspicions about you is much more helpful.\n\nStill, I haven't gotten any bad endings on accident so far, so while getting the best endings aren't easy the first time through, normal endings are still satisfying. Also, as said before it does fit the story so I can't complain too much.

Przyczyn\u0105 ca\u0142ego ambarasu jest Orion - uroczy duszek z r\u00f3wnoleg\u0142ej rzeczywisto\u015bci, kt\u00f3ry przez przypadek wpad\u0142 w umys\u0142 bohaterki, wypychaj\u0105c z niego wspomnienia. Kierowany poczuciem winy, postanawia pom\u00f3c jej z\u0142o\u017cy\u0107 wszystko w ca\u0142o\u015b\u0107. Nie b\u0119dzie to jednak \u0142atwym zadaniem - nie tylko dlatego, \u017ce Orion nie mo\u017ce mie\u0107 \u017cadnego wp\u0142ywu na \u015bwiat zewn\u0119trzny (a wi\u0119c do ko\u0144ca pozostanie jedynie g\u0142osem w naszej g\u0142owie), ale r\u00f3wnie\u017c dlatego, \u017ce musimy uchroni\u0107 si\u0119 przed lud\u017ami, kt\u00f3rzy mogliby zechcie\u0107 wykorzysta\u0107 nasz\u0105 amnezj\u0119 do w\u0142asnych cel\u00f3w. W dodatku w tle grasuje morderca, kt\u00f3ry jedynie czeka na pope\u0142niony przez nas b\u0142\u0105d.

Jednak jedynie od nas zale\u017cy, czy nasz ukochany rzeczywi\u015bcie zostanie naszym sprzymierze\u0144cem, czy te\u017c przemieni si\u0119 w naszego najgorszego wroga.\n\nNale\u017cy zaznaczy\u0107, \u017ce poszczeg\u00f3lne w\u0105tki w por\u00f3wnaniu z innymi grami otome s\u0105 raczej kr\u00f3tkie - ka\u017cdy z nich mo\u017cna spokojnie uko\u0144czy\u0107 w 7-8 godzin. Jest jednak pewna rzecz, kt\u00f3ra je wyr\u00f3\u017cnia - korzystaj\u0105 z tego samego settingu, ale opowiadaj\u0105 zupe\u0142nie r\u00f3\u017cne historie. I tak w jednym Toma mo\u017ce by\u0107 naszym ch\u0142opakiem tylko po to, \u017ceby w innym wskoczy\u0107 na miejsce starszego brata. W jednym szef kawiarenki, w kt\u00f3rej pracujemy, jest osob\u0105 ciep\u0142\u0105 i \u0142agodn\u0105, a w innym tyranem strzelaj\u0105cycm do ludzi laserami z oczu (chocia\u017c na szcz\u0119\u015bcie nie dos\u0142ownie). Jednocze\u015bnie fabu\u0142a ka\u017cdego z w\u0105tk\u00f3w jest zaskakuj\u0105co sp\u00f3jna, ciekawa i dosy\u0107 mroczna - ilo\u015b\u0107 trudnych i kontrowersyjnych temat\u00f3w sprawia, \u017ce gra mo\u017ce nie spodoba\u0107 si\u0119 m\u0142odszym osobom. Ca\u0142o\u015b\u0107 czyta si\u0119 naprawd\u0119 dobrze i je\u015bli jedynie lubicie podobne klimaty, powinni\u015bcie by\u0107 zadowoleni.\n\nJest jednak w tej grze rzecz, kt\u00f3ra ewidentnie kuleje - kreacja bohater\u00f3w. Jestem przyzwyczajona do tego, \u017ce bohaterkami gier otome s\u0105 zazwyczaj szare myszki, ale w przypadku \"Amnesii...\" mamy do czynienia z chyba najbardziej biern\u0105 protagonistk\u0105 wszech czas\u00f3w. Tw\u00f3rcy niemal\u017ce wymuszaj\u0105 na nas uleg\u0142o\u015b\u0107 wzgl\u0119dem innych postaci, nie pozwalaj\u0105c na zdecydowane rozwi\u0105zania i nie pozostawiaj\u0105c nam du\u017cego pola do manewru. Ch\u0142opcy s\u0105 sympatyczni i warci poznania, ale przyznam szczerze, \u017ce chyba \u017cadna inna gra nie przedstawia tak du\u017cej zbieraniny m\u0119\u017cczyzn z zaburzeniami osobowo\u015bci. Osobi\u015bcie lubi\u0119, kiedy bohaterowie przedstawiaj\u0105 sob\u0105 r\u00f3\u017cne typy charakter\u00f3w, ale jednak zachowuj\u0105 si\u0119 w spos\u00f3b naturalny i swobodny. Lubi\u0119, kiedy mog\u0119 powiedzie\u0107: \"Z takim m\u0119\u017cczyzn\u0105 jak X na pewno zwi\u0105za\u0142abym si\u0119 w realnym \u015bwiecie\". Tymczasem gdybym spotka\u0142a realnego Tom\u0119, Shina, Ikkiego i Kenta (o Ukyo nie wspominaj\u0105c), to ucieka\u0142abym od nich jak najdalej. By\u0107 mo\u017ce problem tkwi tak naprawd\u0119 w r\u00f3\u017cnicach kulturowych i zachowania, kt\u00f3re podobaj\u0105 si\u0119 Azjatkom, niekoniecznie musz\u0105 trafia\u0107 w gusta Europejek. W kolejnych wpisach postaram si\u0119 przybli\u017cy\u0107 Wam bohater\u00f3w \"Amnesii...\", wi\u0119c b\u0119dziecie mogli wyrobi\u0107 sobie swoj\u0105 w\u0142asn\u0105 opini\u0119.\n\nNa uwag\u0119 zas\u0142uguje r\u00f3wnie\u017c oprawa audiowizualna. Muzyka nie przyt\u0142acza i s\u0142u\u017cy oddaniu klimatu okre\u015blonej sceny w grze - nie wpada w ucho, ale r\u00f3wnie\u017c nie irytuje swoj\u0105 powtarzalno\u015bci\u0105. Je\u015bli za\u015b chodzi o grafik\u0119, to w przypadku \"Amnesii...\" zachodzi pewien paradoks - ilustracje wygl\u0105daj\u0105 gorzej, ni\u017c przedstawienie postaci w grze. Przyznam szczerze, \u017ce w zasadzie \u017cadna z ilustracji nie przypad\u0142a mi do gustu, g\u0142\u00f3wnie ze wzgl\u0119du na ma\u0142o proporcjonalne twarze bohater\u00f3w, a szczeg\u00f3lnie protagonistki. Natomiast w grze postacie wygl\u0105daj\u0105 naprawd\u0119 dobrze i s\u0105 przepi\u0119knie animowane - gra\u0142am w wiele gier otome, ale to w\u0142a\u015bnie w tej urzek\u0142 mnie spos\u00f3b animowania oczu i ust. Sam design postaci mo\u017ce si\u0119 podoba\u0107 lub nie - to oczywi\u015bcie kwestia gustu. W mojej opinii bohaterowie s\u0105 zdecydowanie za bardzo wychudzeni i nieproporcjonalni - ja wiem, \u017ce wed\u0142ug japo\u0144skich standard\u00f3w posta\u0107 powinna mie\u0107 nogi a\u017c do nieba, ale mi akurat \u015brednio to odpowiada. R\u00f3wnie\u017c ubi\u00f3r naszych ulubie\u0144c\u00f3w jest dosy\u0107... dyskusyjny. Zdaj\u0119 sobie spraw\u0119 z tego, \u017ce narzuca go sama konwencja gry, ale jednak wola\u0142abym, \u017ceby byli ubrani w normalne ciuchy.\nOsobnym tematem s\u0105 t\u0142a - proste, ma\u0142o skomplikowane, utrzymane jedynie w paru odcieniach. Podejrzewam, \u017ce mia\u0142o to s\u0142u\u017cy\u0107 przede wszystkim konsolowcom graj\u0105cym w o wiele mniejszej rozdzielczo\u015bci.\n\nCzy gr\u0119 polecam? Generalnie tak, bo je\u015bli przymkniemy oko na dosy\u0107 ekscentryczne zachowania bohater\u00f3w, to otrzymamy naprawd\u0119 dobr\u0105 i wci\u0105gaj\u0105c\u0105 opowie\u015b\u0107 o poszukiwaniu w\u0142asnej to\u017csamo\u015bci. Je\u017celi jednak wolicie lekkie komedie, to raczej b\u0119dziecie zawiedzeni.

Do not confuse it with a Horror game of nearly the same name, because rather than leave you fearful, this title has the potential to leave you with a tremendous sense of awe, and almost sadness; not that the story is sad, but that it is over and you will never again experience it as you did that first time.\n\nI 100%\u2019d this game, something I almost never do, simply because I HAD to see all the endings, and the thought of being done with this game was more than I could handle. It is voiced (a big plus vs. other otomes) and keeps the story moving without burdening you with excessive side jobs to grind likeability stats.\n\nI'll attempt to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but if you don't want to risk it, I will say this: get this game. This is the first game I have purchased where I wish I had spent MORE on it. I got this game on sale for $7, and I've seen it go under $5. It is worth full price. If you see it on sale, do not hesitate, grab it. This is a beautiful, smart and joyful game any visual novel fan should experience. Use one of the guides, I recommend Pie-inator\u2019s, to help you get to each of the endings and enjoy. \n\nPossible Spoilers Below\n\nAmensia: Memories is about a girl who loses her memory when as stray spirit collides with her head. Whoops. Now, instead of any sense of self, she has a friendly little guide by the name of Orion to help her get through life and figure out who she is, and who she can trust. After a brief introduction to Orion, you\u2019ll pick your world, meaning, pick your guy.\n\nThe first choice is Shin. Shin\u2019s path is a good mystery. He\u2019s a pretty typical tsundere, and your childhood friend. His best quality is that he understands the MC and will do absolutely anything to help and protect her. This path\u2019s main function is to introduce you to the cast of characters that will play important roles as you continue your journey to understand the truth about this world you have stepped into.\n\nNext up is Toma. If you didn\u2019t think there is a little something wrong, and dark, about your situation while playing Shin\u2019s path, you will understand it now. Toma\u2019s path is not overly unique for otome\u2019s and visual novels, but it\u2019s pretty twisted. Orion\u2019s interaction with your character takes it to the next level, especially if you\u2019re going for the happy ending. It\u2019s pretty great making bizarre choices in a game and having someone actually call you out on it.  \n\nNext up is Ikki, a playboy type who you think you have all figured out the moment you meet him. But this is the path where you begin to realize this world has some really strange things going on, far beyond the normal. Ikki\u2019s path is very sweet and really turns all of your assumptions about the character around. By the end, you\u2019ll probably have a little crush on Ikki, and that\u2019s ok.\n\nThe forth path is Kent, a character who has mostly sat in the background in the previous paths. He is quiet and intelligent, and a bit harsh. As you begin this path, both you, Orion, and the MC wonder how it is that you are actually dating this guy. Your relationship is pretty rocky, to say the least. But the further you go down this path, the more and more Kent\u2019s true character comes out. This is probably the most romantic path, and ends in such a sweet way that you may find yourself falling for this adorable nerd. \n\nAlong the way, as mentioned, you\u2019ll also be interacting with Orion. His presence up until this point is pretty much a mystery, though if you\u2019ve been paying attention you\u2019ve started to get some clues as to what\u2019s going on. His company really elevates the entire experience so far through his adorable reactions and unwavering support of the MC.\n\nIf you\u2019ve gone this far, you have also met the strangest character in the cast, Ukyo, and buckle up, because now that you\u2019ve completed the other four guys\u2019 paths, Ukyo\u2019s is now available to you. This is where the story goes from strong to unreal. Ukyo\u2019s path is the story of the world, the overarching plot that ties all other paths together and explains exactly what happened to the MC. It is heartbreaking and beautiful and very well may have you in tears by the end. Not to mention Ukyo\u2019s path has a grand total of NINE different endings. \n\nWalking the path with Ukyo is dangerous and confusing, but leads to one of the biggest payoffs I have ever experienced in a game. It takes some time to get to this path, but to not experience this path is to not experience the game.\nOverall this game is breathtaking, with beautiful art, fantastic music and an out of this world story. It is a SMART story, and doesn\u2019t talk down to the player, but rather challenges you to accept unbelievable circumstances as truths. It is not your typical otome. There is a depth to this world that you would expect out of a big triple-A RPG, not a casual visual novel. It is a must have for any visual novel fan.\n", "timestamp_created": 1462214824, "timestamp_updated": 1462214824, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22763256": {"recommendationid": "22763256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198228126776", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480008282}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0421\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0430 \u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0435.

The Japanese voice acting is stellar and there is a considerable amount of humour in the game as well. There are lots of other reviews that do an excellent job of pointing out the highlights of this game, so I would just like to address any concerns on the negative ones.\n\n[h1]Toma's path[/h1]\nAs someone who has played many Japanese visual novels, read manga and watched anime, I can unfortunately attest to the fact that Japanese r.ape culture is surprisingly (or not?) bad. Part of the reason why I have trouble playing Japanese made visual novels is because of the rape culture (*cough*The Second Reproduction*cough). Off the top of my head, I can think of a few in the game that I've seen many other times in Japanese VNs/anime/manga: \"Only I can see you in a swimsuit\", \"If you let me into your room alone, it's your fault if I do something to you\", \"All men care only about sex\", \"I can't trust you alone with another man\", or literally anything that Toma says. Now, the sad truth is that this is not something that is necessarily problematic with the visual novel\u2014it's simple ignorance apparent in many Japanese visual novels. I would recommend trying to look past this in order to enjoy the visual novel. I think Toma's path is very well-written, but as a woman (or as anyone, really) it's terrifying. What's even more terrifying is that some people who played that path actually enjoyed it! The path is disgusting in the sense that it's a tragic reality (perhaps not as extreme as what Toma did) that many people in abusive relationships face, and the fact that the game romanticizes it is awful.\n\nHowever! Toma's path does not ruin the rest of the paths for me. In fact, it makes Shin's all the more satisfying. I still think it's worth playing because it provides lots of background information and is has the ability to make me keep reading, like how those nasty zit-popping videos I can't tear my eyes from. (Also, you need to play Toma's path in order to get the final path, soooo\u2026)\n\n[h1]Protagonist's Passivity[/h1]\nI understand how this might frustrate some people who either i) don't play many visual novels or ii) are used to badass protagonists with a zinger around every corner. Admittedly, I enjoy badass protagonists, but the protagonist we're given is recovering from amnesia and is in a very vulnerable position. Hers is the personality to stay calm in extraordinary circumstances\u2014that doesn't make her boring. I found it interesting to see her 'original' personality form, as well as new bits from her interacting with the world differently. The guys comment on it as well, and at the end of the game it's almost startling when the protagonist speaks for herself (to represent the memories coming back) in a way that removes choice from the player. It's only at the end that we (the protagonist, Orion, and us the player) see the protagonist's true personality. \n\nOverall, I would give this game a big thumbs up. The rape-culture is very cringe-worthy, and if you have had experiences with abusive relationships and/or sexual assault, I would steer clear of Toma's route. I did buy the game on sale (90% off!) and I'm not sure if I would buy it for $33\u2014but then, when have I ever spent that much money on a game? My route preference was: Shin, Ikki, Kent, Ukyo\u2026 Waka, Orion, Sawa, Mine, Rika\u2026 uh, the heroine? The apartment, maybe.

He seemed two faced and a bit obnoxious. I told him I hated him and he took his fanclub out to karaoke, leaving me in the yukata and missing the fireworks show. What a prat. If someone had done that in real life, no matter how popular they were, I really would've told them to piss off. [spoiler]It ended with him bemoaning how lonely he was and implied that he was off to drown himself in the sea.[/spoiler]\n\nSecond time it went a little better. With Shin I appreciated his honesty and trusted him to the best of my ability, earning a normal ending. Sometimes I questioned his actions, but I knew in my heart that I could trust him. [spoiler]I thought I had done enough, but ultimately I couldn't unlock the true ending and didn't managed to confront Towa.[/spoiler] I was still happy with Shin, though. He was a good guy who said it like it was, even if it was sometimes a little harsh he had the best intentions. He reminded me of my partner in real life, having a less than ideal childhood and a few close friends. Very likeable once you get to know him.\n\nThird time I romanced Kent. It was really difficult at first, as that over logical personality kept grating on me, but as the character himself admitted, he was used to being \"disliked for this reason\". I felt stupid around him, which is not an attractive qulaity. However, I persevered, and I grew to appreciate that he really was doing nothing more than trying his best. [spoiler]I eventually unlocked the memories he was so scared of me finding out and in the end, it didn't change my feelings for him one bit.[/spoiler] Being intelligent and logical isn't a bad thing, and in the end he found his emotions were more important.  Love isn't an equation. [spoiler]I achieved the true ending in this case, and I did feel very happy knowing my actions didn't cause him to miss out on a chance to study abroad.[/spoiler]\n\nUpdate: Fourth, Toma. I just finished Toma's story and I hope he dies in a fire. I actually feel angry at this game for romanticising toxic relationships. As another character says, the dangerous thing is that Toma doesn't realise his insanity.

Good for me, because I'm a loser when it comes to horror games. Travelling in a world filled with beautiful, thoughtful yet stubborn men was an experience I was happy to have. \n\nThe thing is, almost all of the men seem to be too unrealistic for my taste. There're many personality disorders, anime stereotypes: you have your tsunderes, overly self-confident guys and everything you can imagine. Considering that this is a \"date simulator\" - it's completely understandable, that the game developers have wanted to make the guys appeal more desireable and mysterious. The game itself can carry on the story pretty well, but when it comes to your playable character - everything seems to fall apart. \n\nOur protagonist, you, doesn't really have any type of thoughts - besides this mysterious Orion-bugboy, who says everything you supposedly think out loud to you. You won't have any monologue by yourself throughout the whole story - Orion will be the one to take care of that. To be honest that was a bit of a disappointment for me. \n\nOtherwise, the game is fun and you get emerged into the story pretty quickly. \n\nPROS of this game are... \n+ The graphics are beautiful and I really like the voice actors in this one \n+ You've got a variety of supporting characters with pretty interesting personalities. So you don't always have to talk to the guys. \n+ Every milieu is kind of connected and you get to see the different roles of the people on different storylines. This makes everything more interesting and surprising. \n+ The game shows which options you have already chosen, in case you decide to play one \"world\" again. \n+ You also get fun mini games and screenshots, linked to your actual gameplay. \n\nCONS of this game are... \n- The characters aren't really that original and some of them aren't even good looking. (To me, at least) \n- The achievements are easy, but it's very difficult to know how to get the good endings. I've only managed to get two bad and \"average\" ending. \n- Some of the parts are the same (obviously) and it kind of boring. \n- The storylines aren't that long, so if you're a fast reader - you'll get through of them quickly. \n+/- You don't get to choose your gender.\n\nMy overall experience was fine. I liked the game, it's fun and it's a great way to kill time. I actually had a little crush on one of the main characters, so I think it worked out for me quite well.

It was a very highly received title in Japan as well.\n\nBased on other otome I've played, I think this is... sort of junk food. Lots of people like it, but that doesn't make it good. Even from a graphic novel standpoint, it's not especially well put together. That said, if you like the premise and you like the fetishes the routes offer, of course you'll overlook these flaws. I'm the same way with other games.\n\nMy first issue was that you have to choose a route at the start of the game. There's no 'let's get to know the characters' thing before you choose a route, which is why I preferred when this sort of mechanic was used in Nameless. \n\nAs others said, you have a passive heroine. Normally, this would be ok, since most otome heroines are self-insert anyway, but she is notable among the genre for her debilitating lack of agency. Based on dialogue which hints at your pre-amnesiac self, it seems that you were a bit of a selfish, needy and demanding person before. The guys generally express a sort of relief with this new, placid 'you'. So, basically, the guys like you because you're pretty, regardless of how you act. There's not even the pretense of personality here and for me, that their standards are so shallow makes me like the bachelors way less. I can't even say it's misogynistic either, since your heroine also doesn't have much reason to like these characters besides their looks.  \n\nYou get a good ending if you're agreeable, a bad ending if you're not. You start the routes essentially already in a relationship, so for me, that already negates one of the most engaging aspects of these sorts of games.\n\nBoth the characters and the storyline are borderline satire. The smart guy's shtick is that he's like a computer; the 'big bro' shtick is that he's crazy obsessed with you, but seems normal; the crazy guy is laughing maniacally one second and remorseful and moe the next; the story keeps making excuses as to why you can't just do the reasonable thing for the sake of pursuing romantic interests. One step more and this game would have gone into Hatoful Boyfriend territory with the ludicrous nature of it all.\n\nIn total, the game caters to the fetish of 'helplessness', which has seen growing popularity in both Japan and North America. Basically, you have determined love interests (no need to search), in pre-selected routes (no risk of not getting guy), where you have no memory (not accountable for past errors or responsibilities) which is caused by a supernatural force (no concerns over actual medical problems), who takes responsibility over not just your memory, but your relationship status (no need for hard decisions) and your boyfriend(s) routinely put in you in a position where 'they will take care of everything' and restrict your agency. There's segments in all the routes which basically have your heroine wait in her room for days at a time, with occasional visits from one of the bachelors. \n\nFor me, there are other English otome that did most of the elements presented in Amnesia much better. It's a shallow game that caters to the right niches.

HE TAKES ADVANTAGE!! why would you want to date this young man, please tell.\ni find it insulting that the game devs expect me to want to be with this mutant of a man with glasses and a frankenstiens monster outfit it is just truly disguting and he is tall and wears glasses. he reminds me of the children in classrooms who are sitting in the back and chew on their pencils and sharpen them with their teeth just for fun. this is freakish. who would want to have a fantasy like this induldged???? tell me please. and furthermore, let me ask this; how am i supposed to believe that this mutant thing is best friends with the aforementioned \"ladies man\" that has gray hair and is ladylike ??? this is a universal improssiblity.\ni cannot remember the rest of the young men they expect me to date because i dont know why maybe they should have tried harder to make me interested in dating these young men but i am not. \ni am most offended by the fact that this company expects and assumes i will believe that this ELF BOY FROM SPACE is just supposed to be inside my head but he can float around and do things on his own??????? does this company believe i am the retard??? because i am not and i do not buy this load of absolute BS for one gosh darn second. Not one. NOT A SINGLE ONE. and it enrages me to think that after all this i am supposed to fit my name in the lines that they provide for me to enter my name. i believe there is something like 7 lines for me enter my name into. this is discriminatory. and i do not like people who do that kind of thing. it is insulting. how am i supposed to fit my entire name in there? instead i had to settle for my screenname on AOL HotDog95! and that just sounded ridiculous coming out of the characters mouth when we are doing the romantic things like kissing. It was not acceptable for this to happen. \nI would also like to add i have no idea why the manager is different in every time line and i think its stupid that they did not offer a detailed explanation why this is the case. I would like a DLC in which you get to play the Managers route in every time line to see how each personality is crafted from the different experinces the manager has and why they are different just because you are dating a different boy. i find this offensive. \n\nlong story short good game good family fun time \n\njust kidding this game is trash and i am not okay with its racist attitude. \n", "timestamp_created": 1455159100, "timestamp_updated": 1455159100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21116292": {"recommendationid": "21116292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084119229", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449698306}, "language": "english", "review": "I love otome games, and there aren\u2019t many that I rave over (that are in English).

Each route starts out practically the same way; the protagonist wakes up as an amnesia victim at the start of August and  her only companions for this is a spirit who can't leave the protagonist's mind until she regains her memory. The spirit helps her try to regain her memories bit by bit whilst trying to keep her amnesia a secret to everyone for special reasons. The more she regains her memories the more separated the protagonist and the spirit become until she can no longer see him.

I don't mind that it's repetitive in nature, it's a studio-quality soundtrack. Atmospheric and easy on the ears.\n\nArt: 8/10 -- I personally enjoy the blurry, hand-drawn look of the backgrounds for each scene, but I know not everybody would agree. Also the outfits on the boys take me to the lawlacaust.\n\nStory: 7.5/10 -- Overall the plotlines in each route are at least tolerable, though the protagonist can be [b]incredibly[/b] frustrating and downright stupid. Holes in different places. Not Swiss Cheese holey, but still holey. \n\nBoys: 7/10 -- For what we get to see of them, the boys whose emotions we get to know the most intimately are Shin's and Ikki's; both of these boys have powerful feelings that come through without them always having to say it. Toma and Ukyo both felt out-of-touch for me, because their characters were a bit outlandish. Toma felt far more troubled than he let on and Ukyo had lost his fucking marbles. I'd have liked to learn more about them. The most \"alive\" of the boys, for me, was Kent. Kent reminded me of a very close friend I used to have and I'll say his characterization for prickly-intellect was spot-on. \n\nCharacters: 10/10 -- THE CUSTOMER IS THE ENEMY!!!! For real though, I enjoyed the supporting characters and how you saw them treat the protagonist in each route. It always changed depending on the love interest and I think it made them more human.\n\nOverall: 10/10, Senpais noticed me\n\n[b]Routes[/b]\n\n[i]Hearts:[/i] Shin is the dream bad-boy of a girl that never grew out of her \"edgy\" phase. He's an insensitive ass-hat at his worst and a loving protector at his best. The plot of his route is overwhelmingly melodramatic with a super-secret-agent-spy-detective-mission. By the time you get to the conclusion of the mission your heart is achy and confused. Your [spoiler]animu best friend tried to kill you[/spoiler]. This is the childhood romance stuff that's so cute I could puke. Shin is a great character and feels like the \"canon\" route [spoiler]aside from Ukyo[/spoiler].\n\n[i]Diamonds:[/i] Toma is attractive, intelligent, and protective of the protagonist [spoiler]even if it means locking her in a cage[/spoiler]. His route follows [spoiler]preventing the protag's imminent death and harassment from Ikki's fan club.[/spoiler] Toma would do anything for the protag because that's what he feels his responsibility is as an older brother and oh my god this whole route made me want to strangle the protagonist because there needs to be a \"tell Toma how you feel\" option WAY early on. All the BS could've been avoided.\n\n[i]Clubs:[/i] Kent is a hyper-critical young man with a hard gaze and soft heart. His social awkwardness will melt the ice on your heart. His logical processes behind every action he takes will make your eyebrows raise up. Kent's route [spoiler]is about learning to live life before he leaves to study abroad.[/spoiler] He is [spoiler]the only male that communicates with Orion throughout the game.[/spoiler] His character really pulls on the heartstrings with his long thoughtful walks and desire to spend time with the protag.

I bought Amnesia when it was 90% off for the winter sale, and it's certainly one of the best visual novels I've ever played. \n\nFor one thing, this game is just incredibly well-made. Now, a good 90% of the visual novels I've played have been freeware ones I've found online across various forums. None of them have had particularly high production values or anything like that; at most they've feature a couple of CGs and a bonus scene or some questions answered by the creator about their game, but besides that they're pretty basic. To get a game with so many CGs, which are remarkably well-drawn and colored; voice acting; an awesome soundtrack (I may or may not have gotten about 60-65% of my playing hours for this game by just leaving it open while I did other stuff on my computer in different windows, just because I really liked the music); mini-games (albeit ones with rather poor controls in several cases, though that may be due to my mouse being particularly terrible);  and over 20 different endings is a completely new experience for me. It's been somewhat hard for me to go back to playing games without most of these nice features, or at least where these features aren't as well done as they are in Amnesia. I feel like I stole something by getting a game this nice for only three dollars.\n\nBut speaking of all of those endings I mentioned, let me discuss the actual routes and characters, since they make up a bulk of the game's experience. The routes are set in different alternate 'worlds', each of which is named after suits on playing cards. Please note that you should probably play the routes in the order they're listed as choices; I made the mistake of playing Toma's route first, since he was the only character I was curious about going in, and I can't help but feel like I would've enjoyed the game that much more if I had just chosen his route last. (In Shin's route, at least, things become a *lot* more predictable once you know the sort of stunts Toma's capable of pulling.) Each route has a good end, a normal end, and several bad ends. Note: there's 5 routes to play, not 4, but the fifth is only unlockable after you've done the others.\n\nNow onto the characters themselves. For the most part, I thought all the romanceable guys were pretty likeable and well-portrayed. Not all of them strike me as 'boyfriend' material, but nonetheless, every one of them was quite interesting in his own right. While the guys are essentially stock otome love interests- we have a blunt tsundere with a heart of gold, a chivalrous playboy whose only *sincere* romantic interest is in you (the heroine), a logical and seemingly cold (but entirely adorkable) nerd, and a yandere willing to do anything to protect you- they're all either played to perfection or with an interesting twist on the usual 'type'. \n\nMy personal favorite character is Ikki, which says a lot, since I typically dislike the 'playboy' type (if I don't ignore them as an option altogether). But Ikki was sweet and had quite a bit more depth to his character than I was expecting, and several times I really wanted to hug him because I felt so badly for him. That said, I don't think I actually disliked any of the love interests, at least not in retrospect. Some of them made me very frustrated, and some of the routes were outright morally compromising (I'm looking at you, Toma), but they were really enjoyable overall. Hell, Toma's route was the first one I wanted to replay- I don't like him as a love interest, particularly, but he was damn entertaining.\n\nAnd while I haven't said anything about Ukyo, he was a different sort of character than I've dealt with in any otome game before. I'm still not quite sure what to make of his route. I will once again offer a bit of advice and say this: DO NOT LOOK UP ANYTHING RELATED TO UKYO UNTIL YOU'VE PLAYED THROUGH HIS ROUTE AT LEAST ONCE. Once again, I made the mistake of spoiling the twist with him before I even unlocked his route, which took away a lot of his charm for me. Instead, playing through his route was something of a drag because I didn't have to piece together any of his cryptic statements or anything.\n\nThis whole review has turned into one long TL;DR, so I'll say this in conclusion: Amnesia was a thoroughly enjoyable game. Even the characters who I didn't particularly like as love interests were quite entertaining regardless, and this is certainly the most professional, well-presented otome game- or visual novel in general- that I've ever played. I probably would've liked it even more had I not spoiled some major aspects of the story for myself, but even given that, Amnesia totally won me over. I'd love to see more on Steam from Idea Factory in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1453751495, "timestamp_updated": 1453751495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.970223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20749475": {"recommendationid": "20749475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198236146358", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452982505}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok.", "timestamp_created": 1453738250, "timestamp_updated": 1453738250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20745360": {"recommendationid": "20745360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032222365", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453556743}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me encanta.

The characters are very well made and it's nice to see such details put into a game. \n\nI really am inspired to write better because Amnesia has very good storytelling and keeps you guessing. I would say if this was a mystery game instead of a romantic game, I would give the game a 10/10 because I couldn't figure how where things were going to go half the time. Visuals and sound 10. But if I added the love aspect of the game in it would be 6/10 altogether. I appreciated that each route was pretty different from one another and mysterious.\n\nI was drawn in by the mystery in Shin's route. Trying to figure out if Ikku was a playboy or not actually was enjoyable when I usually hate characters like him and ended up liking his character anyways, surprise, surprise. Toma's route was terrible for me, I was bored but I completed it anyway. I didn't want to start Ukyo's route at all because I hated him (since he kills you so many times in other character routes) but I ended up loving his storyline the most because it connects the whole storylines together in a way. Kent is still my favorite character route to play I suppose because he is the most realistic out of all the guys in the storyline. I have to give many stars to the creators or writer of Amnesia because it is a well written, imaginative story.\n\nFor romantic storylines?\nAs for the belive-ability of the love stories, I would rate it a 4/10. There were times that I got really bored with the direction of love the story was supposed to be taking. I don't know why I am picky about that. I believe part of it was because the main character herself didn't have much of an interest to me, but then again it's not her fault since she has amnesia. But even when she did recover her memories I didn't like her in most of the routes. The love stories were unique though I have to say. The only ones where she was endearing to me as a character were Kent and Ukyo's routes. Surprise, surprise! Good thing Orion is there to help move love plots along, or else I think I would have hated the love stories in other routes even more!\n\nI recommend this game if you are into most love otome games. If you are not, the next good appeal about it is the mystery and figuring out what's going to happen which was the major score for me. I recommend buying it at a lower price, but I guess the quality of this game is worth the full price for some people.", "timestamp_created": 1453411294, "timestamp_updated": 1453419361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20661470": {"recommendationid": "20661470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036316241", "num_games_owned": 558, "num_reviews": 304, "playtime_forever": 557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453223111}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4 \ud329\ud1a0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc81c\uc791\ud55c \uc5ec\uc131\ud5a5 \ube44\uc96c\uc5bc \ub178\ubca8 \uc554\ub124\uc2dc\uc544 : \uba54\ubaa8\ub9ac\uc988\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uae30\uc5b5\uc0c1\uc2e4\uc744 \ub73b\ud558\ub294 \uc554\ub124\uc2dc\uc544\ub77c\ub294 \ub2e8\uc5b4\uac00 \uc81c\ubaa9\ub2f5\uac8c \ub09c\ub370\uc5c6\uc774 \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uc783\uc740 \ucc44\ub85c \uae68\uc5b4\ub09c \uc5ec\ub300\uc0dd\uc5d0 \ube59\uc758\ud574\uc11c \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud558\uac8c \ub418\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uc5b5\uc744 \uc783\uae30 \uc804 \uc5b4\uc7a5\uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc798 \ud558\ub358 \uc5b4\uc7a5\ub140\uc600\ub294\uc9c0 \uc8fc\uc778\uacf5\uc5d0\uac8c \uce5c\ud55c \ucc99\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \ub124\uba85\uc758 \ub0a8\uc131\uc774 \ucd9c\ubab0\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uba74\uc11c \uc774\ub4e4 \uc911 \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4\uac00 \uc6d0\ud558\ub294 \ud55c\uba85\uacfc \uc5f0\uc560\uc9c8\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc758 \uac8c\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uc5ec\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubcf4\uba74 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uac00 \uc790\uc8fc \ud558\ub358 \ubbf8\uc18c\ub140 \uc5f0\uc560 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc5d0\uc11c \uc8fc\uc778\uacf5\ub9cc \uc5ec\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ubc14\ub010 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\uaca0\uc9c0\ub9cc \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\ub2e4\uac00 \ub0a8\uc131\ub4e4\uc758 \uc2ec\uae30\ub97c \ubd88\ud3b8\ud558\uac8c \ud558\uba74 \uace7\ubc14\ub85c \uadf8\ub4e4\uc758 \uc190\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc808\ubcbd\uc774\ub098 \uac74\ubb3c \uc625\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \ub358\uc838\uc9c0\ub294\ub4f1\uc758 \ucd5c\ud6c4\ub97c \ub9de\uc774\ud558\uac70\ub098 \ubc29\uc2ec\ud558\ub358 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce5c 5\ud1a4 \ub364\ud504\ud2b8\ub7ed\uc5d0 \uae54\ub824\uc11c \uc5ec\uc8fc\uc778\uacf5\uc774 \uc548 \uadf8\ub798\ub3c4 \ub0a9\uc791\ud588\ub358 \ud749\ubd80\uc5d0 \uc774\uc5b4 \ub300\ud1f4\ubd80\uc640 \ub450\ubd80\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub0a9\uc791\ud574\uc9c0\ub294 \uacb0\ub9d0\uc744 \ub9de\uc774\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\ub370\n\n\uc774\ub807\uac8c \uc704\ud5d8\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \uac00\ub4dd\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uacfc \uc8fc\uc778\uacf5\uc5d0\uac8c \uc811\uadfc\ud558\ub294 \ub0a8\uc131\ub4e4\uc758 \uc678\ubaa8\uac00 \uc774\uc0c1\ud558\uac8c \uc0dd\uacbc\ub2e4\ub294 \uacf5\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uc18c, \uc81c\ubaa9\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc544 \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \ud504\ub9ad\uc154\ub110 \uac8c\uc784\uc988\uc758 \uacf5\ud3ec \uac8c\uc784\uc778 \uc554\ub124\uc2dc\uc544 : \ub354 \ub2e4\ud06c \ub514\uc13c\ud2b8\uc640 \uadf8 \ud6c4\uc18d\uc791 \uc554\ub124\uc2dc\uc544 : \uc5b4 \uba38\uc2e0 \ud3ec \ud53d\uc2a4\uc758 \uc815\uc2e0\uc801 \uacc4\uc2b9\uc791\uc774\ub77c \ud310\ub2e8\uc774 \ub418\uba70 \uadf8 \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \ubcfc \ub54c \uad1c\ucc2e\uc740 \uac8c\uc784\uc774\ub77c \uc0dd\uac01\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1453389722, "timestamp_updated": 1453391333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502296", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20653835": {"recommendationid": "20653835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074462904", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510794888}, "language": "english", "review": "Great! it's such a wonderful and touching game with great characters!!!!!

Since Steam's change in discount policy, Amnesia has been on sale for $3 after 90% discount.  That alone should be enough to invest at least 3 hours of your time in a guy you're interested in.  [i]Side note, you can't just call off the relationship with a guy in the world you pick, because this type of game is built with the assumption that you intend to pursue these guys.[/i]  It's $3 worth of silly writing, romance, and good-looking guys.  Now... Reasons why $3 is worth your time...\n\n[h1]Likes[/h1]\n\n1.  Character and CG art are done well.  The artist does a good enough job with mixing up different viewing angles of the scene, but the placement of hair or other parts of the characters makes the viewing angles of their faces look weird (i.e. their noses seem to disappear).  Similarly to CG viewing angles, it was a nice touch to have character sprites facing the player in order to convey a sense of direction.  Likewise, these additions add to some imagination that two characters are directly looking at each other.  There's also lip movement when characters talk so the player isn't staring at stiff mouths all the time.\n\n2.  Plots for 4/5 guys are done well in the sense that it's not romance-focused, but more mystery-focused as the player pieces together what happened before the heroine lost her memories.  At the same time, the player has to take care to not max out the suspicion parameter lest that triggers bad endings or characters may take advantage of that.\n\n3.  Each guy has a distinct archetype so the player can freely pick any to start.  Overall, Shin and Toma are the childhood friends (i.e. romantically aggressive and romantically a doormat, in that order); Ikki, Kent, and Ukyo (<- unlocked after playing the other 4) are the older guys roughly ages 21-26 (i.e. not-typical-playboy; stoic, logical guy; and aloof romanticist).  [b]Word of advice[/b]: Don't pick Toma's route (Diamond world) if you're not familiar with an archetype made popular with Mirai Nikki.\n\n[h1]Dislikes[/h1]\n\n1.  [b]Whoever wrote Orion's lines needs to be suspended for a while[/b].  A lot of people hate hearing Orion, and I agree in that Orion was the weakest link.  Although I appreciated Orion's hinting of how to respond to specific situations, his role as the heroine's voice and partner-in-crime was horrible.  The game's rated T for Teens, but Orion's regurgitation of really obvious information and constant attempts to get you to doubt everything were patronizing at best, and very insulting at worst to the average 13-19 yr old's reading and problem-solving skills (or am I giving teens too much credit?).  Furthermore, taking his advice seriously in Ikki's route(Spade) can get you the bad ending quickly.  Likewise, Orion forgot to remind the heroine to read her diary in Toma's route (Diamond) which would've saved a lot of headache.\n\n2.  Beyond Orion, writing is [b]very spotty[/b] in Toma's route and a bit in Ikki's route.  Logic was missing and anyone who understood dramatic irony can piece together the mysteries quickly, which makes Orion's remarks even more irritating.  Overall, the heroine is written so then she only has more lines [i]after she regains her memories[/i].  Before she gets all of her memories back, she is practically silent except when picking dialogue choices.  I'm sure people don't stay silent all the time just because some memories are missing, especially if it's a survival issue of not letting others know they have amnesia.  Something to keep in mind is that the almost-silent heroine exists [u]because it's a common storytelling device to allow the players to project themselves onto her[/u] (e.g. Persona 3 and 4's silent protagonists... except they had personalities too...).  While I wouldn't mind it in an otome game, this storytelling device was done poorly and if you want a voiced otome heroine, look to [i]Hakuoki: Demon of the Fleeting Blossom, Code: Realize, or Norn9: Var Commons[/i].  The wording of the dialogue choices can be frustrating sometimes, because there are the obvious ones and the less obvious ones that boost the trust and affection parameters.\n\n3.  A minor dislike in the backgrounds.  Although stylistic and doesn't clash with character art, the resolution was noticeably awful when zoomed in for the purpose of perspective.  Not only was the resolution bad, but the backgrounds don't look like they were manually drawn and look like filtered photos.\n\n4.  Getting the air hockey achievement wouldn't be so bad if the devs just optimized the friggin' game.  The lag is intense and there has already been a major thread providing self-taught solutions to minimizing the lag so the mini-game can be tolerable.\n\n[h1]Final Say[/h1]\n\nFor $3, you can't go wrong with purchasing this game if you're into the otome visual novel genre.  Just think of it as a discounted game that can provide you with a light story and some laughs along the way.

Because there are plenty of non-Japanese gamers who were instantly turned off by a silent heroine and some of the things the guys say (e.g. \"Watch your surroundings full of guys oogling your bikini\", \"Don't you know it's dangerous to invite a guy to your room when living alone?\", \"I don't know if I can control my urges\" etc) because part of the writing is influenced by Japanese storytelling targeted at Japanese women.", "timestamp_created": 1452927740, "timestamp_updated": 1452927740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20553860": {"recommendationid": "20553860", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047384465", "num_games_owned": 1421, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452920119}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Otome visual novel!

Usually I'm pretty satisfied when I drop the VNs that I've been working on regardless of completion status, but it's a first this time that not only have I completed Amnesia within 20-25 hours across the span of two short days but that I still want [i]more[/i]. \n\nFive paths. All unique. All satisfying. I loved how the characters tied back into each other across parallel worlds, picking each subsequent playthrough based on the character that intrigued me the most in the previous. Perhaps it was just a mark of how well things were done that I felt that with every playthrough I found out more and more about the overall storyline with no extraneous or repetitive revelations (so regardless of order, the sentiment would be the same) or that I somehow managed to pick the one best combination for optimal satisfaction: [spoiler]Ikki > Toma > Shin > Kent. The revelation about the girls at the end of Ikki's route really helped when I met them in subsequent routes. And Kent just ended off everything with the sweetest note.[/spoiler]\n\nSinful voices. Gorgeous character art. Memorable personalities. And happily ever afters that I just want more of. Some of the paths are a little counterintuitive (to my personality) but there isn't really any choice that doesn't have plenty of clues laid out if you're paying attention. If I have one complaint is that there isn't more of the side characters; you do get more of them when you pursue Bad routes, but I'd have liked it more if the MC could've had both guy and friends, y'know? [spoiler]I felt awful about the lack of attention that Sawa got for the most of the game if you were trying for the Good ends; you needed to ignore her so many times![/spoiler]\n\nStill. If you like VNs and you haven't played this game, please do. If you like anime, give it a shot since everything is fully voiced anyway, so you could technically just set it on autoplay, kick back and enjoy it. 10/10 would play again. Confession?

The mystery evolves very smoothly, and the more you go on the more you want to know what happened to the heroine or what the other characters are 'hiding'.\nSome people may find the fact that the heroin doesn't actually talk till the very end of the game weird or irritating, but I didn't mind it 'cause Orion was always speaking for her (sometimes I wish he would just shut up lol).\nThe minigames are very easy, and I think they were...Unnecessary, maybe? Idk, I played them just to get the achievements, they were pretty boring.\nEvery character is interesting and none of the routes are boring. Well, I already knew about THE THING in Touma's route, so it made me laugh lol. Yeah, maybe that was avoidable. Oh, my favorite pg is Ukyo btw, but his route is full of feels and I actually liked him more in the fandisk (Amnesia Crowd for PSP). I can't decide who gets the 2nd place between Kent and Shin, they were both cute~\nThe translation was very well done imho. I play games in japanese all the time, and translations aren't always well done so I was a bit worried about Amnesia, but I was pleasantly surprised. There were, however, some lines that didn't match at all with what was being said, or lines where the subject of the sentence was wrong, causing a bit of confusion (I remember noticing this near the end of Ukyo's route: the written lines didn't make sense and were a bit confusing, so I ignored them and listened to his voice instead). The lines that didn't match were for the most part minor parts (like insults or short sentences), so it didn't affect the quality of the game. PS: I'm not talking about things hard to translate: they were \"normal\" sentences which could have been easily translated. I wonder why you do a nice translation and then make such avoidable mistakes or totally change the meaning of a line. \nSo, to sum it up: I LOVE Amnesia, and if you don't understand japanese then this is perfect for you. I bought it when it was \u20ac2.79 and, honestly, if I had to buy it now at full price I wouldn't, because I like japanese games more and bought this just out of curiosity. Amnesia is worth its price tho. It's well done, it has VERY nice graphics and a good plot.

This isn't an indie title or an OELVN, this is one of the most popular otome titles in Japan by one of the largest otome game companies localized for PC. The game goes for $80+ or more in Japan, so $30 is more than worth the price of the game's content. It also gets a lot of discounted sales, so there is no reason to not buy this.\n\nIf you haven't watched the anime, I would suggest playing the game first. Also, consider using a random playing card generator to pick your route order, it was really fun for me lol. Playing in the order from top to bottom is best though.\n\n+ Art is top notch quality and absolutely beautiful. Gorgeous colors, complex character designs, and a multitude of CGs. Although the backgrounds are a little weak, you don't spend too much time in one place.\n+ Japanese voice acting is and always will be an A+ for any game. Personally, I put the text speed to 0, so the text could match up with the spoken dialogue length.\n+ The routes are long. Multiple endings add a lot of replayability.\n+ A great choice system that applies to you (the player) and the heroine's personality. The consequences do matter as you could put yourself into a bad ending. Getting the good endings without a guide was extremely satisfying for me. The effort to reach all the endings don't require walkthroughs (though tempting), it just requires a lot of patience (a quick save/load function would have been appreciated).\n+ A strong mystery story and good use of the amnesia trope. The routes cover entirely different storylines with an overlapping mystery that is revealed through the final route. The story reaches a satisfying conclusion, although bittersweet, and should answer all questions.\n+ Strong character personalities that go beyond otome stereotypes, I was thoroughly surprised that Ikki became my favorite guy when I had written him off as the player type.\n+ A lot of extras such as short stories, minigames, and nice CG rewards for being a completionist\n+ I prefer a balance between story and romantic scenes, which Amnesia does right. There are cute moments and sexual tension scenes. Ikki managed to make me blush after trying hard not to. I felt satisfied with each world's relationships *except Toma's\n+/- The minigames in the menu aren't utilized in the main game at all, even though there are scenes where the minigames could have been used. For that reason, they felt more like an afterthought as an extra. Also, the air hockey minigame has unexplainable lag, which makes it frustrating to beat, but not impossible.\n+/- Music is so-so. It sets the mystery (with a bit of horror) mood, but no tracks really stood out to me.\n\n*A note for achievement advice: the gallery has a hidden minigame. The rose stickers on certain CGs have voice clips hidden in several spots of the photo (follow the controls). [u]I can confirm that you must do this in ONE SITTING to unlock the achievement.[/u] Thoroughly click all over the pictures because there is about 6-7 dialogues each (don't forget the variations and zooming out).\n\nOverall, Amnesia has become one of my favorite otome games and I really hope the other titles (Crowd, World, and Later) can be localized.", "timestamp_created": 1452307634, "timestamp_updated": 1458291186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618611", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20406291": {"recommendationid": "20406291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015694250", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 151, "playtime_forever": 1143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452266598}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0434\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043a. \u0425\u043e\u0442\u044f \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e \u0441 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0443\u0434\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0432 \u0438\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0435, \u0443\u0436 \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043c \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f. \u0425\u043e\u0442\u044f \u0432 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043c \u043d\u0430 9\\10 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u044f\u043d\u0435\u0442", "timestamp_created": 1452289314, "timestamp_updated": 1452289314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.440379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20402325": {"recommendationid": "20402325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061787871", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452880052}, "language": "english", "review": "I hadn't heard of this game before, only saw some of the characters, and I have to say it's quite unexpected!

I didn't know much about the game before hand since I only decided to play this when I saw a friend tweet about it. Good thing I bought it on a discount. \n\nOverall it's a nice game to waste your time with. The character art is so pretty.The routes that I liked at most part was Ikki's and Kent's but barely (one reason why I liked the other is because there's an option to break their kokoro hahahaha). The plot is interesting at the start, but for some reason I end up fast speeding throughout the game. I think Kent's adorable, but he's a jerk. Well, most of the guys are really. \n\nThe plot would have been great if it was executed properly and it maybe it showed us more about the MC's inner struggle instead focusing on her rude male leads. Like maybe add drama to how she felt personally. I'd like to see her looking through old pictures of friends/family and feeling sad. Or how would she react if she realized that her family isn't in good terms? Or wondering if the her before was better than the her now.\n\nI didn't like that most of the guys were passive-aggressive or sexually aggressive to the MC. I can't believe she can't even call the police even though that is the most reasonable choice. Or go to her family. Find her relative's address. Get ideas from her classmates/workplace instead of trailing along strange guys who you happen to be \"in love\" with in your pre-amnesia days.  \n\nMost of the guy's weren't nice at all, especially Toma. If you guys are suffering from a past abuse it'll probably trigger  some bad memories. Love can't alone can't cure someone. In the end, you have to cure yourself. And right now, I think I'm just probably forcing myself to finish the game for the sake of the trophy's. \n\nThe game itself feels like it's forcing you to be a submissive, \"innocent\" and guy-pleasing girl. Most of the time I had to wince while the guys manhandle the poor heroine. I wish there was an option which allowed the heroine to break up with them and find her own way of solving her amnesia without relying to some strange guy who says he \"loves the heroine\" meh. [spoiler] I never felt so happy when the heroine broke up with Ikki it was really satisfying especially throughout the whole time I forced the heroine to handle those scary fangirls. [/spoiler]\n\nLastly, I wish the female lead had more voice. She's so passive. So quiet. Why can't she talk back? Why can't she disobey the guy? And why is she blushing when obviously what the guy is doing to you is disturbing, degrading and embarrassing? Why does she have to listen to Orion when some of his advises aren't reasonable at all? \n\n I don't hate the game. I just really am frustrated about it. The story would have been good if they added some emotional moments centering on the heroine instead of her current love problems.

However, this is not your average VN because of its dynamic complex plot where a \"spirit\" named Orion bumps into you and you get the option to choose between worlds to enter and live. In addition, you remember nothing other than your name and are doing your best not to raise suspicions among co-workers and friends. Your family are who-knows-where.\nNeedless to say, you start each world with a different boyfriend and different realities or personas between characters. Take \"Manager\" for example, the guy changes his behavior between each world.\nThere is a hidden theme in the game (spade...clover...Diamond...Heart... and I'm not sure what was the fifth one they made represent the fifth / Ukyo )\n\nComing from Con Vs. Pros.\nPro: \n-Somewhat unique storyline -- I mean you still have amnesia throughout all of it, but the boys have different backgrounds you will have to go through and learn about. (( (Slight spoiler) There is a yandere & someone with split psycho behavioral disorder amongst the five. ))\n-Voiced -- Not everyday will you get a completely Japanese voiced Otome game for a reasonable price based on the quality of the game given.\n-Beautiful Illustrations -- Many of us know that this is as high quality as it gets. / Hot as hell. / Even the simply backgrounds give a sense of professionalism\n-Five Long Routes & multiple endings. It does have some replay value if you don't get the good ending on the first try, but if you are like me and after doing four rounds of Ukyo and not doing so hot, you'll have to rely on guides. It's impossible unless you have a million hours to spend crashing and burning. However, if you're also like me, I fear bad endings so it's been a tough ride. The endings are also satisfying to an extent. I mean, no one has babies or anything too drastic, but you do get a peek into their future. I highly recommend Kent because well, he's simply cute, but many tend to like Ikki or Shin (no matter how mysterious that guy is.) If you look at my hours now, which should surpass around a day's worth (I took breaks in between routes) , that is how long it'll take to finish four routes (depending if you don't get short bad endings) & by looking at the guide, it feels like I'm just going to constantly get spooked by Ukyo for an eternity. It has taken me about a night and evening to finish a route so I'd say about 5-7 hours per route on good ending, but it really depends on your speed. I like to immerse myself and understand the storyline before continuing panels so I might be one of the slower readers. \n*Trading cards\n*Cute CC's / Wallpapers\n*Minigames\n\nCon: \n-Price I think the hardest choice for me was judging whether the price was worth it.

But basically, our MC has had an accident, rooted from multiple ways (it's what I like about this game most- after one playthrough with one route, it's not the same base story like other visual novels/otomes when you do another route) and as a result from the accident she has amnesia. In the game, you need to figure out stuff about your past whilst not making it obvious that you have amnesia. Also you pursue a guy.\n\nEssential Characters:\n\n[b]Orion[/b]\n-Am I the only one who is heartbroken we can't pursue him? No? Okay..\n[spoiler]Spirit dude who collided with the MC and took up her memories. He helps the MC recover her memories throughout the game and is very adept to do so. A typical shota, energetic and cute.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Shin[/b]\n-He actually isn't as Tsundere as he seems.\n[spoiler]The MC's childhood friend. His route is the most mystery/crime surrounded, and I really like that about his route because it gets you hooked. He seems fairly rude at first, but later in the route warms up.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Toma[/b]\n-YANDERE SATAN. DO NOT TRUST THIS BASTARD ;;\n[spoiler]Toma is also the MC's childhood friend. He is very friendly and caring, loving & affectionate towards the MC. He's a nice guy, as you can see, but later in his route you will be suprised. Even shocked.[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]....if you like being drugged, locked inside a cage, and treated like a pet, Toma is for you.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Ikki[/b]\n-Don't know what to include in this side note, other than I'm 100% sure his zodiac sign is Leo.\n[spoiler]Ikki is friendly. His arch is 'the flirt', though. Girls surround him all the time during his route. He has a certain condition, where his eyes - if looked into - make you fall in love. This doesn't work on the MC, for reasons explained later in the route. His route is quite interesting and even his bad ends make you wonder.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Kent[/b]\n-Definetly the most romance-ish with his route. It's a great route if you like the 'they thawed the ice-man' type of love story.\n[spoiler]Kent is the detached, methodical cold & calculating type. He's a math freak. You have to do a math quiz thing during his route, which is either a great challenge that is stimulating or irritating and pointless by your personality. Don't know what else to put here.[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]J o k e r - W o r l d - U k y o[/spoiler]\n[spoiler]......

It's up to you, with the help of a spirit called Orion to navigate and try not to get yourself thrown into the explosions of Bad Ends.\n\nIf you're expecting full-on fluff and all, this VN won't be for you. There're some fluffy moments, mixed with slight comedy but otherwise you're on the mystery/thriller/emotional rollercoaster train. This VN explores some dark elements in terms of human nature, as well as the struggles between doing what feels right and what doesn't, whether to follow your heart or your mind.\n\nAll the routes differ from one another, but overall there's actually a hidden connection between all of them which makes it all the more fascinating.\n\nSo far I'm thoroughly enjoying it. The writing is interesting, though it can be a little slow-paced in a route or two but otherwise it's very well-written. Especially the Joker route.

interacting with characters around you, some of whom may be trying to manipulate you. Like we're talking \"oh, this guy seems nice...... Welp, I'm trapped in a cage now.\"\n\nThere's multiple different playthroughs and each playthrough has at least one good, one normal and one bad end.

But more importantly, this game really shines as a whole. A lot of visual novels try just go with the different routes being unconnected so that you get a different experience with each, but not too much of a whole story. Amensia memories is able to provide the unique experience of multiple, separate routes while all braiding back together into a beautiful story. \n\nThe characters are also incredibly well done. While it is true your boys have this tendency to monologue at you, I rarely found myself wanting to skip through it. Often, I would say man, I wish there was a route for the girls in this game just because they too are well done and I would love to see more of them. \n\nThe final detail that makes Amesia Memories unique is the story telling is refreshing because of one lovable spirit. Orion takes the role of the narrator, guide, and friend so while the protagonist is not entirely robbed of her own voice and personality, it puts her on the back burner from having to forcibly describe every scenario and feeling. Often, visual novels get into an awkward form of story telling where the protagonist fails at \"show, not tell\" and painfully details every thought and feeling. Instead, we have Orion asking your opinion and formulating plans that show how the protagonist, and subsequently the player, feel about it.\n\nYou will laugh, you will cry, you will spend the night in a dog cage, and you will die plenty of times. It's a wild ride, but it really is worth it. I highly recommend finishing each possible ending to get the full extent of its value. Like I said, this visual novel is at its best as a whole, so if you pick it up, be prepared to devote some time to getting the big picture.

"review": "I bought this game during the 2015 Autumn sale. I've never watched the anime, but I heard bad things about it. But since the game was insanely cheap during the sale, I decided to buy it and I didn't regret it.\n\nYou play a girl who has lost her memories. And depending on which \"world\" you choose during the prologue, you're the target attention of a certain guy. Your goal is to try and recover your lost memories without letting anyone on to you having amnesia. \n\nThere are 5 guys, each with their own route. In order to unlock the 5th guy's route you have to get the \"Good Endings\" for the 4 other routes. \n\nThe guys in the game are pretty likeable. At the start of each route, I was like \"wtf who the fuck are you\" but by the end of each route, I ended up really liking each guy. \n\nEach of the guys have their own personalities:\nShin- The guy who acts like he doesn't give a shit, but he actually does give a shit\nToma- The guy who acts like your older brother, but secretly wants the V. \nIkki- The ladies man\nKent- The nerd who is awkward as fuck in a relationship\nUkyo- The guy with a double personality. \n\nPersonally, Shin is my favorite (and so is his route). \n\nThe art and music are both BEAUTIFUL. 10/10 \n\nThere's also 2 mini-games you can play (by selecting them on the title screen): Rock-paper-scissors and Air Hockey. Unfortunatley, the air-hockey doesn't work for me because it lags a lot :/  The rock-paper-scissors is kinda fun, but I only played it to get the achievements. :P\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game. I did find some of the routes a bit boring, though. I really liked Shin's, Toma's, and Ukyo's route, but I found Ikki's and Kent's a bit boring at times. I still did enjoy them though. :) Now I might try watching the anime series because I heard it's not as confusing if you've played the game.\n\nTL;DR buy this if you want to date a bunch of hot animu guys", "timestamp_created": 1451371668, "timestamp_updated": 1451373172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20056825": {"recommendationid": "20056825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061133147", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3098, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449535509}, "language": "english", "review": "Amnesia: Memories includes beautiful visuals, voices from characters, mini games, and everything as mentioned.\nThere is more options that will fit with most personalities of the player.\nAs other reviewers have mentioned, there are questionable messages in the game to reaching the \"best ending\". \nTo sum it up,\nthis particular otome is a mix of romance and horror. Most likely leaning towards horror depending on which ending or route it leads to.\nThe plot is interesting enough to invest your time in the story whether you play to jump into the romantic aspect or not.\nI give my sympathies for those who were in hopes for a lovey dovey time. \nThis game is full of surprises, bad or good. \nOnly you, the player, can decide.", "timestamp_created": 1451364271, "timestamp_updated": 1451364271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20056768": {"recommendationid": "20056768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247903852", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463064604}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my first review here ^^  I loved this game since it appeared but I had the oportunity thanks to Steam to play it in english, wich is very nice.

Even though he talks a bit too much, he adds a lot of needed personality to the game\n\n\nCons:\n-Toma\n-Romanticizes toxic relationships \n-Sexist. The male protagonists treat the heroine like an item who can\u2019t fend for herself and blatantly don\u2019t respect her (Something I don\u2019t exactly fancy in general otome)\n-Not enough original thoughts or insight from the heroine. I understand that the heroine is supposed to be a self-insert, but it would be nice to give her a bit of in-game personality. It felt like I was controlling a lifeless doll.\n-Predictable, limited in-game choices. You can tell a bit too obviously which choice is \u201cgood\u201d and which is \u201cbad\u201d\n-Not enough slots to save and bookmark \n-Vague parameter system\t\n-Pointless, boring mini games\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t the type of game I\u2019d usually play, but after reading good reviews and finding out it was on sale for a good price, I decided to try it out. When push comes to shove, It's nothing that special. If you like otome games and gorgeous art, you\u2019ll enjoy this game. The translation has its flaws, but it\u2019s much better than most of the otome games you can buy on mobile nowadays. It\u2019s also less expensive, since you don\u2019t have to spend $2.99 to buy each chapter. If you want to play this game but have no prior knowledge of visual novels, I would definitely recommend playing some low-key, less intense games before buying this one. I can\u2019t imagine going into this game without being familiar with anime tropes and the culture behind its gameplay, since some of the characters and places can come off as odd or unsettling. The key is to not overthink the story flaws (even though they\u2019re in abundance) and just play it for the romance routes. If I wasn\u2019t a person who relied heavily on story growth and world building, I would have given this game a higher score.

I wasn't disappointed.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID... I do have some issues with this game. \n\n1. I absolutely hate how passive the heroine is. She just lets all these guys tell her what to do and she doesn't even care. Unfortunately this is a trope that a player will see in almost any otome game they play. :(\n\n2. IF you haven't played this game, which I'm assuming you haven't because you're reading reviews, DO NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES play the DIAMOND WORLD first. DIAMOND WORLD. Make sure you remember DIAMOND WORLD. Fortunately I didn't play Diamond first but I can say that if you aren't into creepy boyfriends, Diamond World will most likely leave you with a terrible first impression and might even make you never want to play this game. I will always 100% recommend Clover World to start out with because in my experience it is the best and least aggrivating (still somewhat aggrivating however, due to the nature of the man the heroine dates in that world)  I could have a little bit of a bias though because I've always had a soft spot for the nerdy types <3\n\n3. Orion. Most people love him. However, I found him to be a little annoying because he never stops talking. \n\n4. This game does a really good job of making Ukyo freak you out. I have yet to play his story (I haven't unlocked it yet because I can't go back to *shudder* Diamond World to get the ending I need) but from what I hear his actions in the game are justified and he's really sweet.\n\nAll of these things aside, this is a really good game if you want a little bit of mystery mixed with a lot of hot anime boys. I really really liked this game, although it might not seem like it. The hot shirtless anime boy scene was totally worth the creepiness of Toma and Ukyo. The math part of Clover world almost makes me turn the game off and chuck my laptop (I really hate math yo) but Kent keeps me coming back er'rytime. \n\n19000000/10 would touch Kent's butt again.

Die ist ein wenig kr\u00e4nk.\n\n[i]\"But I'd be okay if you kept touching me forever.\"[/i]\n\n\u00dcberdramatische Wendungen (teilw. schon Klischees) hat jede Story. Nachdem man die vier durch hat schaltet sich eine f\u00fcnfte Welt frei, Joker, in der die universelle Verbindung zum Vorschein kommt. Auch wenn ich es mir schon im Groben zusammengereimt hatte, fand ich die komplette Storyidee am Ende klasse, inkl. der \u00fcberdramatischen Teenieschei\u00dfe. Es war herzerweichend. Am Ende war ich doch zutiefst ger\u00fchrt vom Gesamtbild.\n\nWer nicht genug von den Liebesschw\u00fcren bekommen kann, der kann in der Galerie noch Bilder mit versteckten Audiohinterlegungen anklicken (sind mit ner Rose markiert) oder sich noch diverse Erinnerungen angucken/durchgehen die nicht in den Hauptstories eingebettet wurden.\n\nSpiel startet im Fenstermodus.

Wer nicht auf eine 100% bei den Errungenschaften aus ist, kann beides aber komplett auslassen.\nZum beenden des Programms musste ich aber immer Alt+F4 nutzen.\n\nAu\u00dferdem bietet dieser visuelle Roman nen Automodus bei dem sich die Dialoge selbst fortsetzen in normaler Sprechgeschwindigkeit (Start am Controller), und auch ein Skip-Modus wo bereits bekannte Dialoge in rasender Geschwindigkeit abgehandelt werden (X Button beim Xbox Controller) und nur gestoppt wird wenn entweder gehandelt werden muss (Auswahl) oder noch ungelesene Dialoge auftauchen. Vergangene Dialoge kann man sich auch anzeigen lassen (linker Joystick -> hoch; beim Controller).\nFind ich alles klasse. Besonders wenn man die Welten wiederholt f\u00fcr andere Enden.\nSchlecht find ich dass man eine Auswahl nicht r\u00fcckg\u00e4ngig machen kann, hab mich 2x verklickt bei ner Option und musste dann von vorne, bzw. letzten Speicherpunkt nochmal anfangen.

So things get crazy pretty quick. You have many hours that you can put into the game, depending on how fast you read, it may vary. The characters are all unique in their own way, some more unexpected than others. The Art is very beautiful, followed along with very well chosen voice actors. The stories all can get you very involved and wanting more. Only bleh is some achievements suck and Orion constantly yappin'.\n\nRecommend: To those who like Visual Novels, unique characters, romance, engaging stories, and pretty art.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nGame: There are lots of hours that can be put into this game which is good when seeing the price on this game. You get also a lot of unlockable additional content which makes it more worthwhile.  Such as memories and short stories in the boys' perspectives. Oh and mini-games which are pretty fun if you aren't in the mood for reading. Good amount of save slots, but in the end, I was wishing for more for Ukyo ~ n ~  Also is great that you can choose how it is read. You can turn on and off the V.A.'s, put it on Auto, Speed through text, show text and previous text all together, etc... Made it definitely a good experience. AND to make things better, if you're trying to get a different ending and playing through again, if you speed through, it will stop and play if there is text that you have previously not read in your other playthroughs! And it will highlight which answers you've already inputed. No trying to remember now :3\n\n\nAchievements: Some of these achievemnts are literally so annoying I just gave up -.- One is where you have to click the image multiple times just for the guy to say a couple things. Looked up where to click and it still does absolutely nothing.  Everyone, but Kent's, I have had difficulty getting one part of their picture to work, It is seriously the dumbest thing ever. >_> The others are easy to obtain.\n\nAnime VS. Otome: I found out about the anime first then the otome. I'm happy I came across the otome because now I realize how BAD the anime is. The anime doesn't cover really anything, Like the first 5-10 mins of the boys' story in the otome, so it was nice to really get to delve into these boys stories way more than the anime ever did.  Only thing is I kind of liked in the anime that Orion wasn't there 24/7. The otome he just literally drove me bonkers @ n @\n\nArt: The art is very beautiful and definitely draws you in.  Their character design is actually very well thought out and you see a bunch of tiny things that really bring everything together, Also with their personalities, it ties in with the design. They have different poses which are good as well. The only weird thing for me is how large some of their hands were... But the style and coloring is very pretty. The gallery has lots of pretty images that are saved from your specific route and you can even move around the picture and check out different areas of it. There was a lot of variety and ones you unlock just from completing certain acheivements. Though that stupid ctrl-left click thing for their \"hidden\" message things were annoying. I'd click and it would end up going to the next image instead. I had an immensley hard time trying to get parts of an image to register. No matter how many times I clicked Toma's fist in the 2nd variation nothing happened, Shin and Heroine picture variation 2, her face would not react at all, Ikki and the heroine at the theatre, the hand wouldn't register. I've looked this stuff up to see if I'm just clicking slightly off, but I am clicking where I need it. So that part gets a 0 in my book because it was just frustrating.\n\nMusic: The music wasn't distracting and pretty good for the most part.\n\nCharacters: The characters all had variety and interesting endings, though some just seemed completely random at times. I wish there could have been more choices to choose from and Orion would STOP making decisions for me -.- I'm looking at Toma's route heavily when Orion becomes really annoying. Speaking of Toma, [spoiler]I wish we could have learned more about why and when he started to have yandere tendencies. Just seeing his past with the heroine, it just seems odd that such a sweetie would now go nut-so if you ask me [/spoiler] I liked the guy characters because they all had their set personality making it fresh when you go to a different route. And many of the stories were very interesting to go into. I don't want to go into too much detail so this will be spoiler free.\n\nShin-> He is such a tsun tsun but  a sweetie ^ u ^ Oh and suprisingly the smartest guy out of the bunch in the end. I guess seemed a bit more realistic to me than the other boys.\n\nToma-> I personally really liked his character, he's definietly not for everyone. I just liked he was really out there compared to the other characters. [spoiler] Though I think the Heroine shouldn't have been all okay after what he did to her @ m @ [/spoiler]\n\nKent-> He starts off a total meanie-poo but like Shin he really isn't that bad. He goes off onto a lot of tangents of things like math and what not. But he was an amusing character.\n\nIkki-> The \"playboy\" or \"pretty boy\" character but reading his story, there is so much more to him than on the surface.\n\nUkyo-> Prepare for the feels! His story is so bittersweet. You can't help but like this guy T w T\n\nBased on the characters themselves and how much I liked them:\n[b]Toma>Ukyo>Shin>Kent>Ikki[/b]\n\n\nBased on stories I found the most interesting are in the order: [b] Ukyo>Shin>Toma>Ikki>Kent[/b]. Ikki and Kent's story didn't interest me as much, I guess they just felt, I guess more like slice-of-life, while the others seemed to be a bit crazier with their stories, drawing me in more. (However, this is just a personal preference)\n\nStory itself: I found it a quite interesting premise, though I wish you could voice up more, Orion ends up taking the brunt of everything, which kind of ruins the effect for me. But  [spoiler] unraveling the mystery in some character's stories for why you have Amnesia were actually quite interesting, some were very dumb though...) [/spoiler]\n\nVoices: The characters' voice acting is very good @ w @ I really enjoyed them. I especially liked Shins. Haha. But I think they all fit the characters very well.\n\n~Overall. I really enjoyed the story and the characters in  it.

What a strange ride this was. It was my first 'real' otome game and I bought it on sale for around $1 and all I can say that it was more than worth it! I loved it so much that I even bought another copy for my PS Vita.\n\n[u]Art[/u]\n\nThe art in [i]Amnesia[/i] was gorgeous! Although some of the character designs were a bit more eccentric for my taste, they were all so detailed and fun and certainly fit into the strange world that [i]Amnesia[/i] is set in. There were varied character sprites for given situations and helped emphasize the characters' moods. CGs were generally varied and detailed. I don't remember there being any 'lazy' CGs, although there were eyecatch CGs that you could get. I don't really count them necessarily as proper CGs though. Sometimes faces of the heroine was a bit awkward, but it didn't detract from anything.\n\nThe only disappointing thing about the art in this game is the how little effort was spent on the backgrounds. The backgrounds are basically nonexistent. While the game was good enough in every other area for me to overlook it, I think some fully realized background art would have greatly helped in the immersion of the story for the player. I can't decide if backgrounds were done in the strange minimal way they did because of budget, laziness or somehow to fit their theme of needing to remember their past/[spoiler]days getting colder/perhaps less realized because of the whole multiworld thing going on[/spoiler].\n\n[u]Story[/u]\n\nWhen I went into this game, I kind of just expected something fairly cheesy and while it was certainly cheesy, it was also a mystery/psycho-thriller of sorts! Most of the routes revolve around a bit of a mystery and puts the heroine in dangerous situations. I felt like I was often doubting the truth of the situation and who to trust. I actually played Ikki's route first without knowing anything about who I was picking in the hub world and was it certainly a shock when [spoiler]I got pushed down a cliff and Ikki goes to avenge me by murdering (???) his fangirls[/spoiler]. \n\nEach character route is pretty much its own contained story and all of them were engaging in their own way. I played Ken's route last and that was a nice break from all the craziness of the other routes. \n\nYou don't really get to know the 'real' story behind the game until you play the hidden route, but it reveals some fun things that explain more about the heroine's situation and all the strange things going on in her life.\n\nIndividual character routes can be hit or miss depending on what you like in a story. I haven't gotten all the endings for all the characters, but the replayability of this game is pretty high and I will probably try to tackle that at some point in the future. \n\nThe writing was generally good. I don't remember any glaring typos or grammatical mistakes. There were a few lines here or there that were a bit strange, but the translation overall seemed sound and very readable. \n\n[u]Characters[/u]\n\nAll the characters were pretty likeable - some moreso than others. As you change routes, your relationships to and with certain characters may shift a bit and this changes how they act towards you as well. The 4 main bachelors were all interesting in their own regard and I won't go too much detail into what each are like, but here are a few sort descriptions:\n\nShin - Your childhood friend in most routes and is one year your junior. He is pretty loyal and kind of hotheaded. He really, [i]really[/i] wants to prove himself to you.\n\nIkki - Super flirty and has his own fanclub of girls. He was the first route I played and I pretty much loved him, even if [spoiler]his \"problems\" were non-issues[/spoiler]!\n\nKent - Highly intelligent and socially stunted, Kent doesn't really understand how to vocalize emotions and ends up just appearing to people a bit like a robot. It's up to ~you~ to help him out of his shell.\n\nToma - Toma is the \"older brother\" figure. He's overprotective [spoiler](that is the biggest understatement of the year!)[/spoiler] and does everything in his power to keep the heroine 'safe'. I hates his route the most, but it was also the weirdest and most surprising route? If you like [spoiler]yanderes who treat you like a living doll[/spoiler], you'll love Toma.\n\nHidden Route - You'll know who it is when you play the game! This will unlock after you get the good endings for all the other guys. [spoiler]At first I felt a bit dubious about how I would like Ukyo, but after learning about what happened to him and the heroine in the \"originating\" world, I found him very sympathetic and I actually liked him! Although he was pretty much a yandere too, I thought his route explained his actions much better than Toma's. Toma's just felt really scary to me! I know some people like that, but it just freaked me out.[/spoiler]\n\nSide Characters - \n\nAll the side characters were fun and added things to the story. Orion, the stand-in for the heroine, as the heroine is more or less mute in this game, was also pretty great! He brought a lot of comedic relief to an otherwise dark story. Orion also was pretty much the voice of reason when the heroine made stupid decisions (I know, I know, I made them [i]for[/i] her, but the game gives me no choice in the matter if I want a certain ending!). It was fun having some sort of company on this strange, wonderful journey of trying to remember if you were in love with a certain boy or not!\n\n[u]Choices and Replayability[/u]\n\nUnlike some other otome games (which I have been obsessively playing after playing [i]Amnesia[/i]), you can pick your character route right away from a hub world. You aren't told who you are picking per se, but are given a choice between worlds named after card suits. Each suit is affiliated with one of the guys and you just pick a world and boom, you're already on your way to woo the guy of your choice. \n\nOnce you are put on a route, you can see some affections meters. There are a few meters you need to keep your eye on and the choices in the game really made a difference. I think I got two variations of Ikki's bad endings before looking up a walkthrough and getting his good ending! With at least 3 endings for each bachelor and little variations in between, I felt like your choices did have an impact, even if you didn't necessarily see it straight away. The deviations in how a story concludes isn't too different between the endings but I think they are different enough to merit seeing all of them.\n\nAs there are so many endings, the replayability is pretty high for this game! Like it said at the beginning, I will probably end up replaying this at some point to get all the endings. I only have the bad endings and normal endings left though so I will probably feel a bit said when I reach them.\n\n[u]Overall[/u]\n\nThis is a pretty fun game to spend a good chunk of time on. Using a walkthrough will definitely help speed up the process of getting the route you want. The art is gorgeous and the story is engaging! If you haven't tried playing an otome game before, I would definitely pick this up. It is 100% worth the full price of the game, but it often goes on sale for a few dollars on Steam. If you're unsure about the game, pick it up then, but I still think it's be worth it if you like visual novel type games with a good chunk of mystery and suspense.\n\nSuggested route orders I've seen end up being a variation of:\n\nKent > Ikki > Shin > Toma > Hidden Route\n\nWith Kent being first as it is the leasty spoilery.\n\nMy route order (as this was before I knew there might be spoilers in one route for another) went:\n\nIkki > Shin > Kent > Toma > Hidden Route\n\nShin and Toma's routes kind of spoil each other's I'd say.

The story was a tad cliche but it is forgiven by having unique characters placed into an immersive setting. Because this game deals with amnesia, the protagonist is in the same situation as you; trying to understand what is going on.\n\nAmnesia Memories has four main routes as well as a possible fifth; each being their own world - Heart, Spade, Diamond and Clubs. The path I chose was Spade World so I do not know what is different using the different routes. I must say that spending around 10 hours to complete the whole route seems somewhat acceptable, it does help that it cost me around 25p for each hour spend playing... You could easily spend 50+ hours in this game and still want to come back to get \"one more ending\".\n\nThe music of the game is good enough to listen to without feeling it is being repeated and the artstyle is very appealing to me.

Shinya Arino was challenged to win somebody's heart in [i]Angelique Trois[/i], an entry in a highly-regarded Otome series. Despite spending 13 hours, following guides, and doing seemingly everything right, his confession of love to Seiran was met with: \"It's 1000 years too soon for you to make fun of me. Wash your face and try again.\" Working so hard only to fail has to be absolutely heart-wrenching, and yet...strangely exciting. \n\nThe strength of a game is in its ability to engage everyone outside of its target audience. On the surface, an Otome game involves romancing attractive men, which to a straight male gamer like myself, doesn't sound all that enticing. However, by utilizing a compelling narrative and/or intriguing game-play elements, I'll find myself immersed in every aspect of the game. Despite my inexperience with the genre, I believe Amnesia: Memories is a fantastic game. It couples a strong plot with great characters, and the few game-play elements bring everything together.\n\nDue to the meddling of a strange kid named Orion, you've lost your memories. As pay-back for the mess he's put you in, Orion offers to guide you through five parallel worlds. In each world, you meet the same characters, but their personalities - as well as yours - are different. Moreover, the world you choose determines which man you could have a serious relationship with. There are other events that can occur, some funny, some dangerous, but all worth experiencing. Whether you find true love, see the story to its conclusion, or even meet a miserable end, is all determined by what you say and the actions that you perform.\n\nAs in real life, the lack of communication can ruin any relationship. Due to your amnesia, you won't know the right thing to say, so you'll have to pay attention to conversations and keep track of the details. While it would be very easy to use a guide and guarantee the best endings, I think actually putting in the effort to know someone is far more rewarding. On the other hand, my initial play-throughs mostly resulted in failure, so maybe I'm not cut out for videogame relationships. The point is that the less hints you have to work with, the more likely you'll become attached to the person you're interested in. \n\nAs your story progresses, a handy chart tracks your relationship with the male lead, as well as suspicions due to your lack of memories. It's amusing that one of the few distinctly \"game-like\" elements actually isn't all that effective. For one, it isn't always clear whenever you say the right or wrong thing. Orion or one of the other characters may chime in, but sometimes you're left in the dark. The charts are more likely to shift when your attention is elsewhere, not when you're saving, reloading, and looking for the slightest change in your \"does he love me?\" gauge. Furthermore, this is all the more reason to not refer to a guide early on. After all, real relationships aren't forged through the use of cheat-sheets.\n\nAs for the guys themselves, I think the writers did a fantastic job giving them plenty of depth. I mean sure, they're attractive enough, but that's to be expected. The most appealing aspect is finding out what they're really all about, and discovering just how much they care. These guys know exactly what to say and when to say it, so those special moments really have a lot of impact. The average story takes about 4-5 hours to complete, and if you're really into someone, there's going to be those few times where he'll really turn up the charm. I'll admit, I get a little light-headed whenever Shin blushes. On the other hand, a couple of the storylines are more intriguing and disturbing than they are romantic. If you've browsed the community hub, or read some of the other reviews, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. If not, then my advice is to play through the stories from top to bottom, exactly as they're listed in the game. In any case, there are more than enough dark and mysterious elements that make for very compelling entertainment. \n\nThis game also benefits from having high production values. Aside from the heroine, everyone is fully-voiced, and the acting is more than serviceable. The CG scenes are very nicely drawn, and the soundtrack is decent enough for setting the mood. The fast-forward system makes replays a breeze, and the mini-games are an amusing diversion. The backgrounds are a little washed-out and bland, but they're the last thing you'll notice when playing the game. Again, this is my very first experience with the genre, but I can tell that the developers really cared to deliver an appealing product. Although, I did notice a few typos in this localization. It's nothing major, especially considering the size of the game, but all the same it's worth mentioning.\n\nAll in all, Amnesia: Memories is a superb example of an Otome Visual Novel. Not only are the stories well-told, but the characters are endearing, and everything looks and sounds wonderful.. It'll take 25+ hours to experience all of the content, so anyone out there wondering if they'll get their money's worth doesn't need to be concerned. Still, I have to admit that I'm a little frustrated with myself. I played through all of the stories and not once was I able to get a good ending without a guide. There was always that one moment where I treated the guy I was dating as a third wheel, or didn't appreciate his gestures of affection, or failed his math test. Ahh...if only relationships were as easy to understand as [i]Dark Souls[/i].\n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:

$3 on a steam sale (might be worth a shot then) there are other VN titles out there with more intriguing situations that will better suit a read be it for story or an emotional experience.\n\nThe concept is interesting in regards to throwing the player as an amnesiac (overly used RPG trope) and you are to interact with her most recent boyfriend (which the player gets to choose which route at the start of a play) to try to remember what  key events lead you to being in a relationship in the first place (which will solve your amnesia if you can manage the standard or good end for the route)\n\nthe ISSUE lies in the execution and weather or not the reader is \"ok\" with relatively passive Japanese young woman as there silent protagonist.\n\nFor its full price, there are many other worthwhile VNs out there that will create more authentic \"feels\" than this, but if you can get it for a bargain price and aren't too serious about reading what amounts to VN twilight (note there are no sparkling vampires, but there is a spirit in your head for a different fantasy cue) and enjoy the work for an ironic reason then Amnesia might be worth it for an unintended laugh.",

In Route B ist Person X eine gute Freundin von dir die viel von dir h\u00e4lt und dich stets sch\u00fctzt.\nAm Anfang des Spiels wird dies auf jeden Fall genauer erl\u00e4utert.\n\nIhr wacht bei jeder Route am 1 August auf und das ohne jegliche Erinnerung an eure Vergangenheit und m\u00fcsst ohne Verdacht zu sch\u00f6pfen zun\u00e4chst durchs Leben kommen.\nDenn wenn ihr allen erz\u00e4hlen w\u00fcrdet das ihr eure Erinnerung verloren habt, weil ein Geist mit deiner Pr\u00e4senz kollidiert ist und dieser Geist in dich eingedrungen ist und deine Erinnerungen ersetzt hat... naja man wird euch als Verr\u00fcckt einstufen und ins Krankenhaus bringen.\nLeuchtet wohl ein :')\nDie Hauptaufgabe besteht darin euer Ged\u00e4chtnis wiederzuerlangen, aber vielmehr auch herauszufinden welche Art von Gef\u00fchlen ihr f\u00fcr den Mann empfunden hattet der euch in den jeweiligen Routen am n\u00e4chsten Stand.\nDas allein ist schon schwierig genug, denn ihr habt viele unterschiedliche Antwortm\u00f6glichkeiten die euch auch schnell zum schlechten Ende f\u00fchren l\u00e4sst.\nUnd so m\u00fcsst ihr euch durchschlagen um am Ende gl\u00fccklich zu sein, so dass der Geist euch wieder verlassen kann.\nDas ist gar nicht mal so leicht!\n\nIch hab auch nach meinem ersten Durchgang ohne jegliche Hilfe angefangen ein Guide zu benutzen um alle m\u00f6glichen Endings sehen zu k\u00f6nnen.\nBis zum jetztigen Stand habe ich beinahe 31h gespielt und habe 5 gute Ending, 2 normale Endings und 3 schlechte Endings gesehen, das verdanke ich zum einen den Guides die ich benutzt habe und zum anderen auch der Tatsache das ich an vielen stellen einen anderen Spielstand angelegt hatte, um da dann eine andere Entscheidung zu treffen!\nAnsonsten h\u00e4tte ich noch gar nicht \"so viel\" an Endings sehen k\u00f6nnen.\n\nDas Spiel hat durch die verschiedenen Endings (5 gute, 5 normale und 16 schlechte) einen hohen Widerspielfaktor.\nWenn ihr 4 gute Endings in den ersten Welten erreicht habt wird die letzte Welt freigeschalten und durch eine aufmerksame Spielweise wird einem auch schnell bewusst weshalb es so viele schlechte Endings gibt.\nIndem ihr auch ein gutes Ending in dieser Welt erhaltet bekommt ihr die letzten Informationen die euch fehlten um alles zu 100% zu verstehen und das ist ein sehr zufriedenstellendes Gef\u00fchl, nachdem alles immer so verworren und durcheinander war!\n\nLeider bin ich noch nicht mit den positiven Aspekten des Spiels durch, denn die Musik im Hintergrund ist stets stimming und passend f\u00fcr alle jeweiligen Situationen gew\u00e4hlt.\nIch bin wirklich ein Fan von der Musik geworden, kann selbstverst\u00e4ndlich auch nicht aufh\u00f6ren die Musik dementsprechend rauf und runter zu h\u00f6ren.\nLiegt aber wahrscheinlich mit daran das ich mit jedem einzelnen Musikst\u00fcck eine gewisse Erinnerung nun verbinde.\nSowas gef\u00e4llt mir bei Spielen immer sehr gut, wenn die Musik ebenfalls einen bleibenden Eindruck hinterlassen hat!\n\nIch hoffe sehr das Idea Factory ein weiteres Otome-Spiel ver\u00f6ffentlichen wird und es wieder so grandios werden l\u00e4sst wie Amnesia: Memories \u2665", "timestamp_created": 1449364732, "timestamp_updated": 1511375240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.659632", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19512916": {"recommendationid": "19512916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021788941", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499901645}, "language": "english", "review": "yanderes\nedit: at least they're hot honestly", "timestamp_created": 1449357775, "timestamp_updated": 1479928814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "4.972962", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19511762": {"recommendationid": "19511762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175117641", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497017447}, "language": "english", "review": "first of all.. damnnnnn the animu is shit compared to this VN. \n\nJust finished Shin's good ending in one sitting and damn the story telling is pretty awesome!

However, trudging through some of the weird premise that all the boys love you without any memories, you'll find a pretty intricate foundation for the world of Amnesia. I found it pretty fascinating in the aspect for world building. I've always been interested in a visual novel that basically goes backwards (due to amnesia).  Story-wise, it's a lot deeper than it appears. It may seem shallow at first, but once added together it has some depth and darkness. It's eerily dark and convoluted for an otome, actually.\n\nA note: Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend it to a male audience. I imagine it would be well welcomed by girls (because it's made for girls). The game is also based on Japanese culture, so some parts may not relatable to a Western audience(?).\n\nGame-wise, while I enjoyed the routes to some degree, half of the characters lacked the development they needed/deserved in their respective routes. A lot of issues especially with Toma and Ukyo are shoved under the rug rather than resolved in a constructive and healthy way. I'm assuming that this may be addressed in the sequel games (Amnesia Later).\n\nI really like the characters themselves! Possibly the only reason I continued to read.

One of the best otome game I've played so far. I highly recommend it! \n\n---\n\n[b]Warning:[/b] This review may contain [b][u]spoilers.[/u][/b]\n\nIn Amnesia: Memories, you first open your eyes to a vast empty space which - you soon learn - is the gateway to many parallel realities. You then meet a spirit (Orion) who basically tells you that he's stuck inside your consciousness; his collision being the cause of your memory loss. The first major choice you make in the game is to pick which reality/world you came from: Heart, Spade, Clover or Diamond, i.e. according to the motifs associated with each of your love interests. There's also an unlockable world (Joker) you can only get after achieving good endings in the other realities.\n\n[b][u]Story:[/u][/b] (5/5)\nUnlike many other visual novels in which you gradually form a relationship with your chosen love interest, I find it refreshing that in Amnesia: Memories you're already in one at the very start. The five routes (worlds) have a similar theme of you having some sort of relationship issues (plus the memory loss), but the plot in each is very different - giving the game a [b]high replay value.[/b] Some of the minor characters even have completely different personalities: most notably, Waka, the manager of caf\u00e9 you work at. Each route took me about 5-7 hours to complete and the game, around 30 hours.\n\nWhile there are some internal monologues at the end of each route, you are entirely silent unless making a choice. Because of this, I feel that it is [b]easy to get immersed[/b] in the story. It's like you're holding a conversation (although one-sided) with Orion throughout the game. Don't worry though, he knows when to make himself scarce during the more romantic scenes.\n\nThe story itself is lighthearted at the beginning, but around the halfway mark it becomes more suspenseful, tragic and even creepy in some storylines; [spoiler]Toma's (Diamond) route in particular (and Ikki's fangirls). The whole incident where he drugs you and put you in a cage made me very uncomfortable; and the fact that we're (as the main character) expected to just forgive him to get the good ending left me really baffled.[/spoiler] Other than that, I truly enjoyed the other routes with Kent's (Clover) and Ukyo's (Joker) being the stand out. At least Kent's route provides some reprieve from the craziness of [spoiler]Ikki's fanclub.[/spoiler] And Ukyo...I can probably write an essay on how I feel about his story but I'll just say it's worth experiencing for yourself.\n\nThere are also a few things I feel that aren't as clearly explained [spoiler](e.g. the wishes, Lord Nhil and the world Orion came from)[/spoiler] but overall it's [b]very well-written[/b] with only a few, minor typos. I also want to mention the various instances where characters tease you with obscure(?) hints (spoilers really) of what can happen to you in the other routes. I find these very amusing especially if you only realize it after playing a few times.\n\n[b][u]Gameplay:[/u][/b] (3/5)\nThe game [b]plays like a basic VN[/b] with dialogue branches and unlockable CGs. There are unfortunately [b]only 24 save slots[/b] in the game. I would've much preferred to keep all my saves instead of having to overwrite each time I start on a new route. If there is a way to watch the complete ending scenes again, I wouldn't mind as much. But since there's not, I think the game could do with unlimited save slots.\n\nThe game provides you with a [b]'Parameter' system[/b] (shown on the 3rd screenshot) to check the status of your relationship and maybe which ending you get in the end(?), but I think it [b]is a bit unnecessary.[/b] The 'Suspicion' meter, in particular, maxes out at some point in the story no matter what you do anyway.\n\nThe 2 mini games available are simple, short and somewhat enjoyable. What I do appreciate about the Rock-Paper-Scissors mini game is the Hit 'N' Guard mechanic that ensures it relies less on luck and more on your reflexes. It does make the mini game way easier however.\n\nThere are also a few extra content unlocked after finishing the game including short stories told from the perspective of the love interests that I find interesting. I recommend reading at least Ukyo's.\n\n[b][u]Controls:[/u][/b] (3/5)\nI was pleasantly surprised to find out that the keyboard (and gamepad?) [b]controls are re-bindable.[/b] Although I don't think I would ever need to re-bind anything for this particular game, I do appreciate the devs putting that feature in regardless. [b]I do wish there was an option to skip the story after picking a choice,[/b] but other than that, I have nothing bad to say about the options menu.\n\n[b][u]Graphics:[/u][/b] (5/5)\nPractically [b]every character in the game is gorgeously designed,[/b] and every voiced dialogue is accompanied by effective use of expressions and eye blinking. The [b]stylized backdrops[/b] with little tints of color suit the game in my opinion and [b]makes it look very surreal/dream-like[/b] in its simplicity. A close-up of the curtains at the Shinano mountain lodge in a few conversations, however, looked very messy and amateurish but that's just me nitpicking.\n\n[b][u]Sound:[/u][/b] (4/5)\nThe [b]voice acting for all the characters are done very professionally[/b] by accomplished voice actors. There are no English voices but the high quality of the Japanese voices more than makes up for it. The [b]lip syncing is just okay[/b]; it's a bit distracting when their mouths move even when they're not actually saying anything. Tracks used for the background music are generally soft and tranquil but slightly repetitive. I can listen to the opening song all day though and to a lesser extent, the ending song as well.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion:[/u][/b]\nA must try for [b]fans[/b] of the genre. I can't say if it's worth it for $30 since I bought it on sale. But for $3, I would definitely recommend buying it.", "timestamp_created": 1449321775, "timestamp_updated": 1449332090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589226", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19499516": {"recommendationid": "19499516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101373104", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449508368}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want to get your heart ripped out of your chest, get depressed, cry a lot and get heartbroken, because you can't find love like one with one of the guys, when this game is for you.\n\n11/10, would get trapped in a cage again.", "timestamp_created": 1449319180, "timestamp_updated": 1449319180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "4.974450", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19498781": {"recommendationid": "19498781", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999876030", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449491348}, "language": "english", "review": "'Date N' joke here, because I am original as well.\n\nIf only bug-boy didn't exist though, would've made it overall better.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1449316742, "timestamp_updated": 1449316742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19487519": {"recommendationid": "19487519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064694238", "num_games_owned": 313, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449268307}, "language": "english", "review": "oh god...

This one isn't quite as amazing bad ending wise, as other Otome games but - There still were many bad ends with several CG's, and it allows for further interactions later.\n\n1) Music: 8/10. The music Looped really well, and I didn't get annoyed with it despite playing the game continually from start to finish. \n2) Voice/Translation: 10/10. The voices came out really well and I actually liked all of the male actor's voices in this. In the story, and the \"extras\" which I won't spoil. There were no bugs or typos in the translated to English version.  \n3) Artwork: 10/10. This was beautiful. All of the CG's/Artwork was impeccable with this. I didn't find any weird looking scenes or anything off with any of them. All of the characters looked like themselves, and MC looked pretty in any of them where you see her.\n4) Characters: 8/10. There's a few things I didn't like which I'll place in spoilers, ordered by who I liked best (A), to who I didn't like much.(E)\n\nA. Toma [spoiler]Not yandere enough. He only went full blown yandere even in what is arguably the \"scariest\" ending for Toma in Ukyo's route.  Toma didn't get maniacal enough on any of the bad paths in his route so it made that one end on Ukyo's route, creepier. Oh, and the fanclub thing. Toma handled it better than Ikki which made me like Ikki less.[/spoiler]\n\n B. Shin [spoiler] I couldn't figure out his character typing. Somewhere between kuudere and tsundere. That annoyed me, he also had a few wtf  choices to get his \"true\" path or all CG's. I also didn't like how Shin confronts Toma at the end for the True End. I get that he's not a criminal but it seems a little tame to just let Toma go with a punch to the face.[/spoiler]\n\n C. Secret Path [spoiler] Ukyo was kind of a cry-baby, I'm not into that type of character either, but at least he had no math and a ton of endings lol. Ukyo's related bad ends in other guy's routes either as they weren't dark enough to make him appear as disturbed as he's portrayed in his own route. Also a couple of his bad ends were similar. I think that there could have been a few more alternate ones added, to tie up what he says to heroine for \"advice\". I think it would have been an interesting bad end to get between Shin and Toma since Ukyo tells you not to, but you really only see Toma lose his mind and go crazy whereas Shin doesn't do anything.[/spoiler]\n\nD. Kent [spoiler] If I recall correctly one of his bad ends literally made me have blank stare face, since It was that predictable too. Not to mention the rival confusion which was MC's boss (yikes.). The math questions... WHY??? Those were not fun to work out in my head when I was just interested in getting the story. To pair all of it off, out of all the guys, Kent to me was the least good looking character model. His hairstyle threw me off, and I didn't like his attitude. It was only later on in the path that I found him okay and I liked his True end. He didn't appear to be as \"book-smart\" as Shin, although he was the character is meant to be mathematical - so that didn't make sense to me. I get that he's supposed to be the intellectual guy but Shin seemed smarter.[/spoiler]\n\nE. Ikki [spoiler]I seriously didn't enjoy this path. At all. I actually found his paths to all be boring to find/get. He didn't seem to have any emotion when MC was being threatened by the fan club at first. and he seemed like a huge coward/paper boyfriend. A few of the options for his true end seem wrong, and it was not that romantic or sweet. I wasn't a fan of the CG for his true end either, and I hated Ikki's personality. This could be bias because I hate the \"player\" type in these games. They have similar \"fanclub\" problems, which gets annoying. It didn't seem like Ikki cared a whole lot, and he didn't give his fanclub a harsh enough punishment for doing what they did to MC. >_> *tosses him in the trash* [/spoiler]\n\n\n5) Story: I haven't watched the Anime Entirely yet, so I'm not certain how much of this comes from the Anime or if the Anime was made based on this game, BUT - The storylines here get pretty deep and they all have at least one or two things in common. I do think that overall the story was really good, but it had a few places where the story seemed to be a little slow, or a few extra days where they weren't really adding much to the story. I also want to say that some of the bad ends I would have prefered to see CG's on. They didn't really seem to have much \"closure\" and the fade to red thing seemed a bit cheap, given how hard some of those ends are to find.\n\nThings I liked:\n*CG Menu. \nI liked the fact that you have the cg with ability to scroll over and see the whole image as some of the cg images are rather huge. I also liked that they're organized by the character's name, as it makes it easier to browse though. \n*Extra stories/Minigames:\nI liked the extra stories that you can unlock, as well as the minigames. At first you don't realise that some of the things are only unlocked by playing these.\n*Bonus True Ending: TL;DR: That path ties everything together and makes the game make sense. \n\nThings I didn't like:\n* No ability to Replay Endings from the Endings menu. \nI didn't like this because while it is fine to replay a game, It's really hard to remember what the right choices were if you have \"already seen\" answers highlighted. \n\nAdvice on what I would do differently:  If you could have the ability to re-watch the full story with an ending that you already unlocked. Then have the game just let you click/confirm the choices for you since you've already unlocked the path. That's something I haven't seen in any other otome game. \n\n*MC wasn't voiced. I don't like this because in auto mode, if MC says something, it skips over it instantly.\n\n*Spoiler for CG's: [spoiler]Point and Click - CG Game. This sucked. To get literally every single CG done, there's no icon change, or any sort of way of telling which picture you have left to click through. It made getting that harder than it needed to be.[/spoiler]\n\nBonus: \nThe Secret Character path... Spoiler alert:[spoiler]This was my third favorite path simply because of all of the bad endings. I wished that all of the other characters would have equally as many bad paths, especially Toma. I don't know if that's related to the anime, or whatnot however so I understand why that is. (Still other guys were not as \"bad\" as they could have gotten on the bad ends.) I sincerely loved the \"true ending\" on the Secret path because it filled in a few of the \"gaps\" that the story left out in the other worlds.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1449202215, "timestamp_updated": 1449203898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19465645": {"recommendationid": "19465645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253185749", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459864760}, "language": "french", "review": "Finally I can play this game !

However, I strongly advise against buying this game for and by young people.\n\nFirst of all, although some of the game plots are interesting, some of the ideas in this game are just plain wrong and often illegal. This is a game promoting violence and objectifying women and glorfying the image of ever timid, submissive and forgiving lady. You invite a boyfriend to your flat for tea - you are asking him to \"have his way with you\". You are walking alone in the evening - \"you are putting yourself in danger and asking for it\". The guy turns insane, holds you in a cage, tries to rape you - the good ending is to \"show how much you still love him\". Another crazy dude is killing you in the most elaborate of ways on various occasions - \"forgive him and be truly happy together\". Most of your boyfriends treat you like crap; to one you are like an item that needs to be protected, another one calls you an idiot most of the time, yet another treats you like shit in public. And the good ending to all of that - be timid, don't complain, let them do what they want and be completely forgving and understanding when they hurt you. Otherwise you won't even hear an apology. This is game makes toxic relationships look romantic and \"fixable with the power of love\". The whole message is so wrong on so many levels that only adult people that already have some life experience and their own opinions should play this game.\n\nThe game is quite passive; a lot of it is just talk talk talk that is basically redundant. The translation is ok at best, there are many grammar errors and weird constructions. The artwork and audio are quite good, though I must admit that in certain CGs or positions the characters look quite \"derped\". Some of the plot ideas are interesting; for example, Shin's mystery line is quite interesting. Some are really, really dumb - Ikki is pure Twilight.

The art is beautiful, the voices are so cool too and the storyline is better than the Anime. Though the anime is cool, this visual novel is better. \n\nYou get to be up close and personal, actually feeling what the character you play feels throughout it. In the anime, the main character seems dull and boring, since she doesn't really have memory to have a personality. But in this visual novel you can choose what sort of personality your character has! \n\nThough the personality you give your character can lead her to trouble, eg Bad ends, it's nice to be yourself or follow a certain personality trait you like and see how that develops with characters! \n\nLike with Kent, it was my first playhrough of the game, didn't know how it worked yet and decided to be myself in it. My character then had her first happy end! I was very happy with Kent. I think I like the intellectual (sp?) type - especially the ones who seem cold and distant, they seem lonely, and before I knew it I started falling in love with Clover! \n\nI did think that some of the storyline from the anime was going to be in the visual novel, which it is was, so I knew what was going to perhaps come with every character.

I wasn't very impressed with the anime (it was gorgeous, but just wasn't that great otherwise) and the initial pre-release reviews for it weren't that exciting. But once I completed it, it became one of my favorite VNs/otome games. I think it's well-worth being a game in your collection, even if you're not normally interested in otome.\n\n[b]Content[/b]: Disturbing themes. As I said in my tl;dr, expect to be murdered a few times. As a minor spoiler, one of the love interests could easily fit under the 'yandere' (sick-love) type. The images never get beyond about PG-13 (for sexiness - you see very little or nothing in terms of violent images). As long as you're prepared for murder and yandere, you should be able to handle what the game throws at you. \n\nI will note that one of the endings was so disturbing I had to walk away for a few minutes. Several of the Bad endings are actually quite disturbing, so while I kind of enjoyed it in the thriller sense, some people might not.\n\n[b]Translation[/b]: Seems quite good! I didn't have any issues understanding what was going on and it reads quite well.\n\n[b]Editing[/b]: A few minor issues. A few typos here and there, but nothing to really disrupt your enjoyment.\n\n[b]Art[/b]: Really top notch. Plenty of gorgeous CGs, a wide range of character sprites, and a really cool style overall. This is absolutely a game you could buy just for the art and be satisfied by if you like what you see from the screenshots. (Granted, it's not flawless, but it is very high quality.)\n\n[b]Character Design[/b]: I personally enjoy it quite a lot. It's a shame you don't see the Heroine very much since I really dig her design, but all of the characters are quite nice to look at. (Okay, it's over the top, but it seems to be normal in their worlds, so it works for me!)\n\n[b]Story[/b]: Have you ever had one of those dreams where you're dropped unprepared into a situation? Like, for me, I get dreams where I have to take a test I didn't know about, or I'm given a role in a play right before the curtains rise, or I'm being put on the field for a ColorGuard performance and have to rely on my memories of doing it in high school. Imagine that, but \"for real\". At least the Heroine has a cute and friendly Orion to help her out a little bit.\n\nYou need to figure out what your life is like in the world you choose and what your relationships are like with the people you meet. Eventually, you'll come to understand you're in a relationship with a guy in the world you're dropped into and balance trusting him and giving him the benefit of the doubt with not letting on too much too soon about not being the woman he knew. \n\nThis delicate balancing act is the heart of each story and I personally found it interesting every time. The individual stories are a little linear, so the first part of a story route is pretty well the same, but it does branch out towards the end, meaning multiple distinct endings for each hero. \n\nFor the most part, I enjoyed each hero's routes. (The \"yandere\" hero, not so much, but I can't say his route wasn't [i]interesting[/i], just not one I'd experience for romance purposes.) I think that most otome fans will find at least one hero they'll really enjoy.\n\n[b]The Heroine[/b]: A blank slate - pretty literally, too. She has almost no text dialogue in the game and you have to simply infer she says something. This means a lot of monologuing on the part of the heroes - which is great if you're digging the voice actors (personally - I love them), but it does feel a little awkward sometimes, especially if the other characters point out that the Heroine is silent. It's clear from the flashbacks and comments from the other characters that she [i]had[/i] a distinct personality of her own before her amnesia, so I'm willing to give it a bit of a pass. Once she gets most of her memories back (assuming she does, that is), she starts having lines of dialogue, so I infer that means she's in full control of her \"self\" again, so the lack of real personality of her own before then feels fine to me in a story sense. \n\n[b]In closing...[/b] I highly recommend the game and hope you enjoy it too!", "timestamp_created": 1445486008, "timestamp_updated": 1445486008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500268", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18553199": {"recommendationid": "18553199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067729159", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445967514}, "language": "german", "review": "Wundervolles Spiel.\nIch hab es schon vor einer Weile hier gesucht, weil die Auswahl hier so gro\u00df ist aber nicht gefunden.\nDaher freue ich mich umso mehr, dass es jetzt hier erh\u00e4ltlich ist.

I went into the game figuring the game would be standard otome fare, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that it's actually very well written, supplemented with good art and sound.  Each of the routes had their own particular charms, which surprised me, and my own expectations of which routes I'd prefer turned out to be totally wrong due to the strength of the story and the characterizations.\n\nLocalization for the game is very good.  For me, poor localization, typos, and awkward phrasing completely breaks immersion for me in visual novels.  In Amnesia, I can't even remember any awkward phrases, and I found only two typos during my entire playthrough.  \n\nThe game does suffer from situations where the protagonist's actions (or lack thereof) defy common sense, though the use of Orion, her onboarded spirit, actually does help.  Orion tends to embody a lot of the inner dialogue (and outrage) of the gamer, embodying sentiments such as \"how dare he say that!\" that the protagonist unfortunately doesn't really ever act upon.  Amnesia also suffers from the common visual novel ailment where as the player it can be virtually impossible to know how to avoid bad ends.  There were thankfully less of these than in some other games I've played, but I did find it often frustrating how a single choice led to a bad end that the game gave me no reasonable clues to predict.  Similarly, I found the good ends frustrating to get because they didn't really follow obvious choice paths.\n\nOverall though, Amnesia is definitely worth the asking price.  It has many hours of gameplay and for any otome fans out there, it's one of the highest quality otome games I've played here in the West.  When playing, I couldn't put it down and basically marathoned the game for a week, and was left wanting more.

And what i like about the game that you finally know how the heroine ends up with each Character .\n\nThe endings are great too ! my favourite would really be Kent's  good ending ! \nPOSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!\nUkyos good Ending was so sweet and sad too . What i loved about that is that you get to know what happend with Orion and that the heroine was able to meet him again.

It's a must have for people who like these sort of games!!\n\nAfter watching the anime back in 2013 and finding out that this game would come out in 2015, I was extremely happy... so after managing to 100% the game, I have to offically say that this is one of my favorite game series of all time! (Now hurry up and release the sequels for us impatient fans!! [Later, Crowd and World]).\n\nWith this being my 2nd otome game that I'd play and with this game already having very high praise from Japan, I was very excited to jump into this new and exciting world where I will finally get the whole story of this universe. Oh how I was impressed with the way this game gave off a very care-free choice option off the bat.\n\nWant to be serious and make a good and believe able example of yourself as the MC of this otome game, or do you want to be as unserious and awkward as possible and make your boyfriend suspicious of you? The choice is all there, especially when you get to chose between 4 (actually 5) worlds off the bat!\n\nI was actually a little anxious that the MC would be one of those annoying, way too obvious or innocent type of girl... sure she is in the beginning, but once she remembers more memories and gets to understand how her boyfriend acts, she manages to remember her personality and is actually very likeable (you even get to see this by the options you have to chose to interact with different people).\n\nBecause of the free reign, it made the story progress very smoothly. There were no unnesecary moments/fillers (if there were they were either fluff moments where the boyfriend is acting all cute or comedy moments to shake off a little drama when it became too much) when playing through the different worlds, which again made each route and ending very enjoyable. And since it's a straight up visual novel, it makes the game very relaxing to play, as if you were going to watch an anime.\n\nFinished all the routes? Why not go for ALL the possible endings? ...Still not enough? Then go ahead and go to your gallery and get some secret messages when you Ctrl+click on rose images where your chosen dream boyfriend whispers sweet-nothingness into your ear as they keep complaining about you clicking on them. Wow, still not satisfied when you have clickable boys and extra fluff memories? Well then air hockey and rock-paper-scissor might just be your thing!\n\nThe ammount of work, time and passion which went through with making this game is unbeliveable to grasp compared to how other games today are released. And this game was released in 2011 in Japan! I still can't thank Idea Factory enough, I couldn't help myself than to buy their limited edition box of this game to support them even more.\n\nAnyway, to sum it all up:\n\nPROS:\n* Characters\n* Beautiful Artstyle (especially the unique eyes)\n* Pro voice acting\n* Very interesting and good story for each of the characters\n* Music\n* Mini Games + extra CG/Gallery hidden story (extras unlock once you get every ending!!)\n* Achivements\n\nCONS:\n* Minor visual/gameplay bugs when quick speeding (but this almost never happened or it recently got patched)\n* Too few save slots\n* Can't replay any kind of endings on the good/normal and bad ending list\n\nOverall score: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1444186103, "timestamp_updated": 1444310176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500268", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18310807": {"recommendationid": "18310807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141540256", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491878487}, "language": "english", "review": "It finally came out in english and on steam to boot <3 \n\nThe art style is beautiful and the multiple endings are a plus.

All of the sprites and CGs are really pretty, and the backgrounds are sort of a muted colors with white.\n\nUnlike some otome games where you spend the first part of the game getting to know the characters and then figuring out which ones you want to romance, this game makes you choose immediately and then you are locked into that guy's route and can only succeed or fail (spectacularly) at it.\n\nThe good part about this is that the stories for each guy are very different, and as your character starts with amnesia (like the title) the mysterious and unknown parts of your life are different between routes. The relationships you have to the love interests and other characters change, which is really interesting and gives the game a lot of replayability since each route is basically its own thing.\n\nThe stories are all very engaging, but there are some definite yandere aspects to some of the relationships, so if that isn't your cup of tea you may want to look into which guys have that before playing so that you can avoid those routes. Or choose them, I guess, if you want to be locked in a cage by a possessive crazy person. :)\n\nThe bad ends definitely kill you, and since the MC has amnesia, she does tend to fall into the otome heroine trope of being fairly passive. There's a story reason for it, obviously, but if you're looking for a spunky MC with her own personality you won't find that here. MC has a few moments, but she's clearly intended to be pretty bland so that you can read whatever you want into her.\n\nI recommend this game, it's a beautiful game with an engaging story, but it's definitely a Japanese otome game in a lot of ways which can be a good or  bad thing depending on how you look at it.", "timestamp_created": 1443325480, "timestamp_updated": 1443325480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18210236": {"recommendationid": "18210236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048917122", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443147226}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

The only thing that I would have liked more was if the heroine had more interaction. She just felt too blank slate-y for me. I like it when the MC\u2019s have a lot of personality and actual dialogue lines! She had 15 lines tops in each route. I\u2019m not complaining fully since I know she had amnesia and whatnot, but she was a bit dull for my liking. My favorite route was [spoiler]Ukyo\u2019s\u2014I honestly found it very emotional and it reminded me a lot of a shoujo/otome version of Mirai Nikki.

Already have 19 hours on it and I have not finished the game yet.\n- [b]Gorgeous graphics and CGs[/b] - The graphics are extreamly colourful and beautiful. There are a lot of CGs, placed at the right place and and very emotional.\n- [b]Mini games[b] - the games are very simple and can be beaten fast, but I highly appreciate them being there. Also rewards you for complition.\n- [b]Emotional endings[/b] - you have 3 types of endings. Good endings are entirly satisfying; normal endings are positive yet not compleatly satisfying; bad endings go from a standart bad ending (the two characters don't end up togehter) to death (main character dies). I was never disapointed by the endings.\n\nCONs:\n- [b]Bad stories[/b] - I still don't have a story I was not bored of. It starts interesting but gets very old in the middle of it. That is due to dragging out plots that are not made for long gameplay.\n- [b]Too long stories[/b] - a path is 8 hours (listening to all the dialogs and no breaks), The stories are not made for such long playthoughs so they drag out. The first story (shins) drags out unnessesary long and I was left with the impression 3 times that it was suppose to end.\n- [b]Orion[/b] - Orion is a character that from now on became a definition for this problem. The little spirit that is to serve as narator speaks too much and takes too much of the screen time. He always states the obvious and repeats what the player already figured out.

Going into the game I had expected to like Ikki the best.\n\n-Spade: Ikki - a playboy who has a \"condition\" where anyone who looks into his eyes falls in love with him. An interesting story that I enjoyed, even if I wanted to shake Ikki most of the time.\n\n-Clubs: Kent - aka the Vulcan option. If you think Spock is hot, then Kent'll be right up your ally. This is probably the one route that was straight romance without a major plot thread involving murder mysteries, supernatural abilities, or crazy yandere boyfriends.\n\n-Joker: I don't want to give much away for this route.

Le pregunta cu\u00e1l es su mundo y le advierte que no debe ir al hospital bajo ninguna circunstancia, ya que su amnesia no es algo psicol\u00f3gico, por lo que debe hacer lo posible por recuperar sus recuerdos sin que nadie sospeche que los ha perdido.  \n\n\u2022Gr\u00e1ficos y Jugabilidad\n\nAl comenzar, tendremos que elegir entre distintos mundos: Hearts world, Spades world, Clovers world, Diamonds World y Joker world (el cual permanecer\u00e1 bloqueado hasta que completes todos los Good endings de los mundo anteriores). Cada mundo tiene como chico principal al personaje con el que m\u00e1s interactuaremos a lo largo de la ruta, manteniendo con \u00e9l una relaci\u00f3n rom\u00e1ntica. Cada mundo no solo se diferencia por los distintos chicos, si no que el entorno, los personajes y las circunstancias tambi\u00e9n var\u00edan entre s\u00ed. Existen diferentes par\u00e1metros, desde la sinceridad y fuerza de la relaci\u00f3n, hasta el nivel de sospecha del chico sobre la amnesia de la protagonista. Tus respuestas y elecciones alterar\u00e1n dichos par\u00e1metros, llev\u00e1ndote a diferentes finales. El juego consta de m\u00e1s de 20 finales diferentes. Y, a diferencia de muchos otros otome game, el peor final no es una mala relaci\u00f3n con uno de los chicos. La protagonista se enfrentar\u00e1 a serios peligros, como amenazas de muerte e intentos de asesinato, lo que hace que la historia tenga un buen punto de misterio y suspense. Por supuesto, no revelar\u00e9 m\u00e1s para evitar spoilers. Tambi\u00e9n tiene varios extras, como historias adicionales de cada personaje y dos minijuegos. Uno de ellos trata de hockey de aire, el cual consiste en marcar X cantidad de goles para derrotar a varios de los chicos que elijamos. El otro (el m\u00e1s entretenido a mi parecer) es el cl\u00e1sico piedra papel o tijera. Si ganamos, se debe golpear al oponente. Si se tarda un instante, \u00e9ste se protege y no obtenemos puntos. Si eres de los que quieren ver todos los finales de cada mundo y quieres volver a jugarlo, tienes la opci\u00f3n de pasar a c\u00e1mara r\u00e1pida los di\u00e1logos que quieras, haciendo el juego a\u00fan m\u00e1s llevadero para los que quieran repetirlo. En cuanto a los dise\u00f1os de los personajes, son fabulosos. Muy coloridos, pero sin perder la seriedad y esencia de cada personaje, adem\u00e1s de un muy buen estilo de dibujo. Sus expresiones faciales cambian seg\u00fan la conversaci\u00f3n, lo cual puede guiarnos en ocasiones para hacernos una idea de qu\u00e9 pueden estar pensando o c\u00f3mo se han podido tomar un comentario. Los escenarios son de un solo color, cambiando el susodicho seg\u00fan la hora del d\u00eda. \n\n\u2022Banda sonora y sonido\n\nLas voces est\u00e1n en japon\u00e9s, lo cual les gustar\u00e1 a las personas amantes de \u00e9sta cultura (hablando claro, al 95% de los que compren \u00e9ste juego). La m\u00fasica no es nada especial, pues consta de  un gran repertorio de m\u00fasica tranquila, a excepci\u00f3n de algunos momentos de tensi\u00f3n y peligro, pero nada que pueda sea recordado notablemente.\n\n\u2022Lo bueno\n\n-La profundidad de los diferentes personajes\n\n-La gran cantidad de finales\n\n\u2022Lo malo\n\n-\u00danicamente est\u00e1 en ingl\u00e9s.\n\n\u2022Conclusi\u00f3n: Es uno de mis otome game favoritos. Jugu\u00e9 por primera vez en la PSP en japon\u00e9s, y ahora he tenido la gran oportunidad de poder tenerlo aqu\u00ed. Para los amantes de \u00e9ste g\u00e9nero, \u00e9sta debe ser una de las joyas de su colecci\u00f3n. Es complicado que los buenos juegos de \u00e9ste g\u00e9nero salgan de Jap\u00f3n, por lo que \u00e9sta es una gran oportunidad que no debes desaprovechar. \n\n\u2022Nota personal: 7\u20199\n", "timestamp_created": 1442326626, "timestamp_updated": 1442326626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18037645": {"recommendationid": "18037645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160591442", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478141014}, "language": "english", "review": "Just as good as I had hoped it would be!

Ikki's story line is fun but you (as well as the main character) feel the frustration. I was very worried about Toma's story line and I would have to say it probably my least favorite.

Unterst\u00fctzt vom Spirit Orion soll sie nun ihre verloren gegangenen Erinnerungen wieder zur\u00fcckholen. Nat\u00fcrlich ist es nicht ganz einfach, sich zurecht zu finden, wenn man sich nicht daran erinnern kann, wo man wohnt, wo man arbeitet oder wer Freund oder Feind ist. Man befindet sich zuerst in einer Art mystischen Raum, in welchem man entscheiden kann, in welche Welt man eintauchen will und je nach Welt gibt es eine andere Geschichte, einen anderen Mann, dessen Herz man gewinnen kann (oder auch nicht), jede Entscheidung hat auf l\u00e4ngere (oder k\u00fcrzere) Sicht eine andere Auswirkung, man kann sich nie sicher sein, ob es richtig war seinem Kindheitsfreund zu vertrauen oder mit dem mysteri\u00f6sen Mann von der Stra\u00dfe mitzugehen (ihr macht das nat\u00fcrlich NICHT!... oder doch? Was hatte Mami doch immer gesagt...? :D).\n\nSonstiges:\n\nMan sollte das Spiel auf alle F\u00e4lle mit Ton spielen, da es eins der stimmungsvollsten Soundtracks hat, die ich je geh\u00f6rt habe. Je nach Situation variiert die Musik, auch Hauptmen\u00fc und die einzelnen Unterpunkte haben Musik. Die Synchronisation (japanisch (\u00fcbrigens englische Untertitel)) finde ich auch sehr passend f\u00fcr jeden Charakter. Es gibt auch ein kleines Minispiel-Feature, wo man gegen alle 5 Jungs Air Hockey oder Rock-Paper-Scissors spielen kann, jeder Mann steht auch f\u00fcr einen anderen Schwierigkeitsgrad. Es gibt 26 Erfolge, die meisten gibt es zu den verschiedenen guten, normalen und b\u00f6sen Endings. Wer Schwierigkeiten hat, alle Endings zu bekommen, sollte es mal hier (https://welcometowonderland.wordpress.com/2015/08/26/amnesia-memories-shin-walkthrough/) probieren, die fand ich ganz gut, weil man auf einige Sachen auch manchmal nicht kommt. Probiert es aber erst mal ohne, man bekommt relativ leicht mindestens das normale Ending bei jedem Chara au\u00dfer Ukyo und da es auch auf alle normalen Endings einen Erfolg gibt, ist das auch nicht verkehrt.\nDas Artwork erinnert an den Anime, es gibt sehr viele Parallelen, nur, dass das Spiel eben mehr Tiefe hat als der Anime, was aber verst\u00e4ndlich ist, schlie\u00dflich hat man in einem Spiel mehr Zeit, die Charaktere und Geschichte kennenzulernen.\n\nSchwierigkeitsgrad:\n\nIch fand jetzt alle Spieldurchg\u00e4nge machbar, ich hatte mindestens das normale Ending bei Shin, Toma, Ikkyu und Kent. Wer es hier ein wenig schwerer macht, ist der liebe (?) Ukyo. \n\nUnd wer soll dein Herzblatt sein?\n\nWie schon gesagt, ihr k\u00f6nnt verschiedene Geschichten spielen, aber wenn ihr im Voraus schon euren Favoriten haben wollt, dann hier ein paar kleine Einblicke:\n\nShin:\nIn der Heart World k\u00f6nnt ihr an ihn euer Herz verlieren und wer auf den geheimnisvollen, ruppigen Typ steht, ist hier richtig. Harte Schale, weicher Kern, das passt gut auf Shin und er ist auch immer wieder f\u00fcr eine \u00dcberraschung gut.\n\nIkkyu/Ikki:\n\nIhr steht auf den Mann, der euch jeden Wunsch von den Augen abliest und euch die Welt vor die F\u00fc\u00dfe legt... allerdings m\u00fcsst ihr ihn euch mit dem Rest der Frauenwelt teilen, denn Ikki kann sich vor Angeboten nicht retten, da seine Augen MAGISCH sind. Wenn ihr damit leben k\u00f6nnt, dann ab in die Spade World.\n\nToma:\n\nIhr kennt ihn seit Kindheitstagen, er ist immer f\u00fcr euch da und scheint alles im Griff zu haben, aber irgendwie verliert er bei euch die Kontrolle, vor allem, wenn ihr Unterw\u00e4sche kaufen wollt... wie weit das geht, erfahrt ihr mit Toma in der Diamond World.\n\nKent:\n\nEr ist schlau, er ist logisch, er ist gut in Mathe und er hat seine Zukunft geplant... aber Frauen sind f\u00fcr ihn ein gro\u00dfes R\u00e4tsel. Das ist Kent, der gro\u00dfe Starke mit der Brille... und er sagt, dass ihr ihn hasst O_O... warum? Findet es heraus in der Clover World.\n\nUkyo:\n\nIhr m\u00f6gt den unberechenbaren Typ, bei dem man oft nie wei\u00df woran man ist? Zwar kann er ganz nett sein und wahrscheinlich seid ihr ihm wichtig, wenn er euch warnt. Aber warum warnt er euch vor sich selbst?... Findet es heraus in der Joker World (und speichert viel :D)\nIhm k\u00f6nnt ihr euch erst n\u00e4hern, wenn ihr alle anderen Welten gemeistert habt (Wichtig: ihr braucht alle guten Endings!).\n\nFazit:\nEins der besten Visual Novels, die ich je gespielt habe. Die Geschichten sind glaubhaft, \u00fcberraschend und auch witzig und s\u00fc\u00df. Was mir noch gefallen w\u00fcrde, w\u00e4re, wenn man den Charakter, den man spielt, selbst gestalten k\u00f6nnte. Die sieht n\u00e4mlich neben den ganzen h\u00fcbschen M\u00e4nnern irgendwie langweilig und blass aus. Ansonsten ist das Spiel echt klasse, gerade diese Vielfalt an Geschichten finde ich super und die vielen M\u00f6glichkeiten (soooooo viele Endings *o*). Der Preis ist nat\u00fcrlich etwas happig, aber im Vergleich zur Spielzeit ist es das wert.

The basic premise is that you as the main character are suffering amnesia, as well as basically a spiritual possession, and are attempting to regain your memories  and free the spirit from your mind.  \n\nThere are 5 total romanceable characters, all male.  The first 4 are available as soon as you start the game, the fifth one unlocks after finishing the good endings for the first 4 characters.  All of them have 1 good ending, 1 normal ending and between 1 and 7 bad endings.  They are all very well defined characters, with elaborate stories and very very different personalities.  You have a tsundere, a popular/playboy who yearns for real love, an intellectual who's aloof and bad with emotions and socializing, and 2 yandere characters that are on opposite ends of the yandere spectrum.  Each one of their stories take place on alternate dimensions, so even though the basic story premise is the same for each, the stories themselves are completely different and the side characters will sometimes have vastly different personalities in each route. As a fair warning, if you are someone who needs trigger warnings, you may have problems with one of the routes.\n\nGetting the different endings requires making different selections during the story branches.  Each selection will either raise, lower, or leave your attributes in their current level of accumulation.  There is no stat raising or grinding, it's just a matter of selecting conversation options to raise or lower your trust, relationship and suspicion with each character.

Truly an otome game after my own heart, portrayed in a way that's great for those who are not generally fans of the gaming genre or looking to play their first one. Possessing beautiful graphics, an A+ storyline, as well as characters each with their own distinct opinions, feelings and identities, this game was well-worth the time I put into it and hopefully the start of many more otome games to come (to Steam). \n\nI found this game to be unique in it's large cast of characters and the relationship dynamics between them, both romantic and platonic. As well as the heroine there are three other girls, Sawa, Mine, and Rika (plus Ikki's crazy fangirls), who each have unique relationships between eachother and the heroine, and of course Waka, the manager, the authority figure of the group who while his personality might change from world to world, his essence does not. The verisimilitude of this game brought about by these dynamics was truly a breath of fresh air. \n\nOf course, no game is perfect. There seem to be issues with recieving the Steam achievments for this game (hopefully that will be fixed, the game is still quite new), I found Ukyo's good end to be a little anti-climatic (I'd already seen the anime, so that probably had an impact), the backgrounds were somewhat underwhelming (pointed out to me while I was broadcasting this game to a friend, though I think it helps to not distract from the characters), Orion was used a [i]little too much[/i] to portray the characters thoughts and feelings (of course, due to their bond he would know all about them), and I was a little concerned about how in Toma's good end [spoiler]after escaping the cage, kissing and making up with Toma, the topic of Toma's mental health and his extreme actions in locking the heroine in a [i]cage[/i] for her [i]protection[/i] were never properly adressed and discussed[/spoiler]. \n\nThis game does possess some subjects that while horror visual novel fans might love, some might find triggering. This isn't an innocent, cutesy otome game. While there's no sex, there are mentions of it in discussions, as well as gory off-screen deaths involving fire, knives, roofs, etc. Plus [spoiler]Toma's cage *shudders*[/spoiler]. \n\nSo to sum it up;\n[list]\n[*]great game,\n[*]well-developed characters,\n[*]unique storyline,\n[*]a perfect start for those looking to try their first otome game or who are not generally fans of the genre,\n[*]hopefully the start of many an otome game to come to Steam.\n[/list]\n\nIf this looks like a game you would enjoy and you have money to spare I reccomend you purchase the game, both for the game itself and to show Steam and game developers that otome games have a viable market here.", "timestamp_created": 1441418563, "timestamp_updated": 1468093101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "4.963904", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17879498": {"recommendationid": "17879498", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020700141", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 668, "last_played": 1516178736}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game so much out of all my otome games PC/Mobile this by far is my favorite <3 I've only played through one route but i am so excited to play the rest.

I should start with a disclaimer that I'm fairly unusual in that I'm a straight male who generally prefers otome VNs, but if you can get over being a virtual girl chasing after virtual boys (or rather being a virtual girl being chased by virtual boys, I suppose) then I would recommend this VN to you regardless of your preferences... assuming those preferences didn't exclude VNs themselves, I suppose.\n\nThe story is fairly simple- you're a girl who lost her memories because I spirit crashed into your noggin or something and threw them across time and space and you gotta retrieve them by talking to a bunch of cute boys in parallel worlds who knew you before you lost your memories... that's about it (well, for the most part... the final arc has quite a bit more to it, but I'm not gonna spoil). Though this fairly simple setup allows it to focus more on the characters rather than developing a convoluted plot, and it does so very well. The writing is very good, dare I say quite exceptional by most standards, I found myself genuinely laughing and crying many times, it was really quite absorbing.\n\nIf I have any criticisms though, the first one would be the character design. Some of the characters look really good: I love the look of the Main Character (henceforth referred to as MC-chan because I'm a weeb and generally a terrible person) and Orion was cute... annoying at first, but he really grew on me; and Toma and Shin are both pretty good looking, but everyone else out of the main cast have outfits that look straight-up ridiculous... I mean, there's a character (Ukyo) who looks like he was a cab driver airlifted straight from the chessboard dimension... another character (Ikki) has what appears to be a tattoo of a spade on his face, which I assume they thought for god knows what reason accented nicely with his spade hairclip... like, what even the..? I mean, the boys themselves look really good, it's just their normal clothing is generally just absurd. I know this seems like a small complaint and it's totally subjective but considering you'll spend the majority of the game staring at them and reading text, if you don't like the way they look it can get pretty grating.\n\nMy second criticism is that in almost all of the CGs, MC-chan looks like a deer in headlights, like \"OMFG HE'S KISSING ME WHAT DO I DO!?\", even when there's no reason for her to do so. I mean I'm not exaggerating when I say that there was an instance in which I (and by proxy, she) asked a boy to hug her, he did, and she looked surprised that he did so in the resulting CG... like, why? Did she suddenly realize she left the stove on back home?\n\nOther than that, there's a minor thing of the talking animations being... kinda lazy, it's basically characters just opening their mouths over and over again in the same robotic way until the speaking audio is done, it reminded me of the Putt-Putt games I played when I was a kid.

I've played games like the Persona series and Harvest Moon series where there are these type of dating sims, but usually those games focused more on other types of gameplay (RPG and farming sim), but this is my first time picking a otome dating sim game where the main point of the game is to go through a span of 30 days with a chosen character where each answer and choice determines if you will be able to truly unlock the memories you've lost through Amnesia. \n\nI thought that after 1 or 2 routes, I would get bored, but I was wrong. I think the strong element that Amnesia: Memories has is its ability to make you continuously want to know what's going to happen next, if you picked the right choices and what the ending you will get. The plot for each 'world' you choose in order to retrieve your memories is determined by the character you interact with. Every route has its differences and you will see how your chosen character develops through the span of 30 days you are given to unlock your memories. I found myself doing my best to get to the bottom of each conflict in each route and when I successfully got through it and achieved the good ending of a route, I felt rewarded for my efforts. and when I got a bad ending, I'd be screeching at my computer wondering what the heck I did wrong. I never thought I'd be invested so deeply in a game where all I literally do is click buttons. \n\nAmnesia: memories caught my interest primarily because of its art. The CG images that are unlockable with each route and sprites are all so beautifully drawn. I also watched the anime that was revolved around this before I realized the game was coming out a week after I watched it. Watching the anime made me more curious about how the game would be and because of having that background, I was able to see how much more the game developed the characters and plot, something the anime could not (due to the amount of episodes). \n\nThe reason I am giving this game a 9/10 and not a full solid 10/10 is because I think that after I have completed and unlocked everything, the game has close to no replay value. I think that if there was additional content or gameplay, there would be a higher chance of this game keeping my interest in the long run if I ever wanted to pick it up and play it again. Unfortunately, after I complete everything, there's not much for me to go back to.  Since this is my first otome game, I'm not sure if that's how otome games are or if there's differences in each one in terms of mini-games and gameplay. \n\nNevertheless, I have been enjoying this game a lot. I am really happy that Amnesia: Memories was my first otome game. It left a lasting impression and I am eager to look into more otome games. I hope Idea Factory decides to localize the other games in the Amnesia series. I know I'd definitely be picking them up.\n\nGameplay: B+\nArt: A+\nMusic: A\nStoryline: A\nVoice Acting: A+\nReplay Value: C", "timestamp_created": 1441135914, "timestamp_updated": 1441137059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17835455": {"recommendationid": "17835455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114680467", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514254511}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a great game!!!!

It was a very rewarding experience, and I do recommend it to anyone who's into that sort of thing. I read a lot of warnings about this game (which are important to take note of!) before buying, and was almost scared away. I'm glad I ended up buying it, though.\n\nFirst off: Not all of the characters are nice. I initially thought every character would be trying to sweep me off my feet, but it's not like that at all. You pick a single route to pursue and navigate your relationship with the chosen male character (and your other friends) in each playthrough. \n\nSecondly: There are multiple endings. For some reason, I had been lead to believe there were only the four routes and each had a single conclusion (which is ridiculous in retrospect).  A \"bad\" character may have multiple sides just as a \"good\" character does. Keep an open mind.\n\nAnd finally, some have said this game is too hard. I disagree! Which I think I can do since this is my first time completing an otome game. I just had some fun exploring the options, saving often, and checking each character's reactions to my behaviour. Save often and if you absolutely MUST get the good ending, don't be afraid to consult a guide for some help.\n\nOne thing I disliked about this game was [spoiler] the diamond route. Toma's route [i]really[/i] creeped me out. I don't want to spoil much, even under a spoiler tag, but he's horribly abusive to the protagonist. However, all his actions are forgiven when she remembers she loved him prior to losing her memories, so they can be together now! Gross. Game would be better without that route. [/spoiler]\n\nOverall, I would definitely say this game is worth the full price, although I bought it when it was on sale.

On one hand, I think some of the plotlines are interesting, and I ended up really wrapped up in what would happen -- Shin and Ikki were my favorites by far. The character art is gorgeous, and I think that the game did an amazing job with the cliche amnesia storyline -- there's a lot you don't know but I felt like characters were suspicious when they should be and not when they shouldn't. There are things about the game that drive me crazy. \n\nThe character you play is so passive. Orion ends up being the voice for nearly everything that happens and all the recapping irritated me. Yes, I know what that character just said, Orion, I was there and there's no need to tell me yet again. I have no idea why your character would even listen to what Orion is saying given that you don't know him and he's just a random spirit that invaded your consciousness and pushed out your memories. Honestly, the game would have been a 1000% better by cutting the part Orion plays in the story in half. I never fully get why in the Toma or Shin storylines you shouldn't call the police, other than Orion tells you not to, so it ends up making no sense at all. Not to mention how you spend the games supposedly trying to recover your memories, but in the Toma storyline you find your diary and then proceed not to read it for no good reason. Why even have you find it when you did when the game doesn't allow you to read it? Orion might have forgot, but the diary is my character's person, and she definitely didn't forget.\n\nIt seems like a lot of people liked Kurt, but I really didn't, and I was so frustrated when I realized there was no way to break up with him. I would have taken a bad ending death to end their relationship, but I couldn't, and in the end, Orion ended up telling me that Kurt was a nice guy, he cared for my character, and obviously my character had feelings for him. WTF. No, no she did not. Her dialogue throughout the path made that more than clear. You see this again at the end of Shin's storyline when your character is sympathetic and apologetic to Toma who was absolutely terrible. I hate it when games force you to think a way that's completely inconsistent with how you're playing your character. There should have been an option for you to say whether you forgive him or not. (The answer is definitely not.)\n\nI was also a little disturbed by the fact that nearly every storyline but one includes either your love interest physically manhandling you in a way that's scary or uncomfortable, initiating sexual contact without consent, or telling you that something you've said or done is going to get you sexually assaulted. Seriously, game? Whether it's a boy that likes you but you don't like them back, or someone who's sexually interested in you while you're either unsure of your interest in them or don't have any interest at all, the game makes it sound like your character has done something wrong. Also, when the women in the game are jealous, they're crazy and murderous, when the men are, it's just because they love you so much. That's not a good message to send. Jealousy isn't sexy or romantic and shouldn't be portrayed like it is. (And as much as a personally liked Ikki's character, I wish the game had addressed the fact that the members of his fan club were all essentially magically roofied by his eyes. This game had so many consent issues in it, and that's before you get to crazy Toma.)\n\nAlso, while this is definitely less important than the other issues I had in the game. I really became sick of some of the repetive background art, particularly during Kurt's storyline where you seem to walk a lot but with no dialogue the repetition is both more obvious and tedious. As negative as I'm being about the game, I didn't hate it. I think it could have been a really amazing game, and I did like playing several of the storylines. But the physical and sexual aggression we see from guys we are supposed to like was a bit too far for me. I get it in Ukyo and Toma's storylines but I hate that it pops up in everyone single one of them.", "timestamp_created": 1441063369, "timestamp_updated": 1441063878, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 115, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.753719", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17819773": {"recommendationid": "17819773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239017584", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1930, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468605508}, "language": "english", "review": "I have waited years for Amnesia to be fully in English!!

[i]This game is not related to the horror game Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, this is an entirely different game.[/i]\n\n[h1]Crazy boys, gorgeous art and some mystery.[/h1]\nYou play as a heroine whom Orion (a spirit) accidentally collided into, and because of that you lost some of your memories. In a span of 1 month you need to figure out whom to trust, what happened,  and piece it out (while the people around you should not know that you have lost your memory so you wont get taken advantage of). I've never had a dull moment in the craziness of some routes. Yes crazy I tell you, like [b]being caged[/b] or [b]almost dead[/b]!   Best of all it's 1080p (high resolution), compared to the original small scaled handheld game.\n\nI have to recommend Amnesia:Memories  because of what it offers: a twist of fun, sweet,  and something crazy. With regards to the difficulty in picking the right direction for a good end to happen, feel free to refer to walkthoughs. I have to say I ran into the bad end multiple times without a guide because the choices are not obvious at all.

Specifying any further would be explicit spoilers, though the information is relayed within the first 10 or so minutes of the game.\n\nHowever Orion acts as the protagonsit providing both your reactions and your motivation in all situations, with your choices, the only means of interaction you have, usually just change 1 to 3 lines of dialouge. Effectively whatever Orion says is what you say, even though he is supposed to be nonexistent fo ranyone but you, also he gets into it way too much...\nOrion winds up being nothing but a bunch of plot convenience, e.g. with no explicit spoilers \"Oh this route's guy is in some kind of problematic situation with local authoreties, we know he is innocent, but I'm worried nonetheless, and that means you have to be as well even though the story gave you no reason to.\" \n\nA story that utilizes amnesia as a story relevant tool has one simple advantage, you can forge all bonds and ties to other characters simulatniously to explaining them to the player, meaning, if used correctly you can combine exposition with story telling. It isn't used correctly though, while the protagonist was portrayed as worried I did nothing but shrug in apathy as the whole \"conflict\" was not an actual issue and easily debunked/resolved.\n\nThe story forces a linear approach on the player, even though the concept doesn't fit that kind of story-telling, causing a huge discrepancy between player and protagonist, having Orion being the actual protagonsit, rather than the player, he makes the calls, influences the interactions between characters and is nothing but a hypocrite in the process and that's putting it lightly...\n\nBy extension that also is quite telling in regards to the writer, here's some examples of the hypocracy and how it's bad writing:\n1st. Orion thinks that Amnesia is treated by confining the patient to a hospital room or their home, took me about 5 minutes of using google to debunk that, he does however know what a goddamn maid cafe is.\n\n2nd. He bases his opinion of humans on the subjective opinion of one of his acquantances and considers them greedy/egoistic, at the same time he thinks you would consider anything they say to be the truth and obey their every whim, making you little else but a toddler\n\n\nThis creates a fun little problem, you are treated as if, by losing all of your memories, you can not understand concepts such as lies, meaning that you wouldn't have common sense either, leading to apathy, otherwise you'd retain things such a common sense thus being able to do simple things such as saying \"No\" or debunking someones bullshit claims.  \n\nHere is a direct quote from Orion to put some of the issues into perspective:\n\"Hee-hee. I'm pretty knowledgeable about human life, aren't I?\"\nThe writer acknowledges the issue, but doesn't bother to fix it... We are talking about a commercial product here, if you know there is an issue fix it, you don't get a free pass by mentioning it and not giving another shit.\n\nNow here is another fun quote:\n\"[...] try to actively meet people and investigate what kind of person you used to be.\"\nThis represents his initial motivation, as for plot related reasons he wants you to recover your lost memories, shortly afterwards however he ignores this objective in order to waste time on investigating an accident in order to make sure it was an accident.\nYou as the player get to point  out, that the clues at hand are insufficient to really bother wasting time on this investgation, but not a single fuck is given by Orion and by extension the writer...\n\nI might not be the actual target group, being male and all, but I sure as hell can tell when a story is written in a bad fashion and the fact that some of the issues are acknowledged within the game is quite telling.\nAll I can say is: Don't bother if you are expecting quality, if you can just roll with all kind of bullshit and don't expect good writing, aka looking for a good laugh, this might be worth 20 bucks or less.\n\np.s. if you are wondering why I didn't use the formatting given by steam in certain places, that is because it didn't work properly", "timestamp_created": 1440712786, "timestamp_updated": 1440713311, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.317907", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17744222": {"recommendationid": "17744222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045713362", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443984720}, "language": "english", "review": "why", "timestamp_created": 1440709486, "timestamp_updated": 1440709486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479626", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17743136": {"recommendationid": "17743136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205431548", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440800973}, "language": "english", "review": "Have you ever watched a Let's Play of a game? Have you ever watched one with an incredibly annoying narrator who talks about 10x more than the entire narration of the game and his attempts at being fun are just incredibly irritating?\n\nAmnesia is an otome game about a girl who has lost her memories and must discover the truth behind who she is and her situation without arousing suspicion. You can choose from 4 different scenarios in which her life is different from each other. However, no matter which reality you pick, her life is pretty complicated, and you will need to get your bearings fast if you are to make the right choices. To make matters worse, in each world you are pursued by a green haired maniac hell bent on murdering you although the reasons aren't immediately apparent\n\nFortunately you have 4 hunks to help you out, though you can only pursue a relationship with one in each world. They each differ in personality and while they do have the typical Otome game borderline obsession with the comparatively bland protagonist it's very toned back in this game compared to your usual Otome game and they actually have conversations with you and other characters in which the subject of the conversation ISN'T you! For me this was a breath of fresh air since I was sick to death of the Twilight creepy obsession\n\nI recommend this game, but only barely. And the reason for that is the opening paragraph of this review. For those of you who have played Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, you will probably understand what I mean right away. Remember that fairy Navi? This game makes me wish I could have her as my companion again\n\nYou will be followed throughout the game by a shota boy with a chipmunk voice who learned to speak from watching the entire 7 seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. He gets 75% of the dialogue in the game, no more than 2 sentences can be spoken before he gives his long winded, annoying and completely unfunny commentary, and there's no way you can get this little pest to shut up! The only positive thing I have to say about him is that at least he isn't PewDiePie\n\nI recommend this game, and I recommend that every time you see an Orion dialogue bubble you immediately click past it.

If you keep reading, I\u2019m going to assume you totally came here on purpose and share my strange passion for dating hot, fictional men who just can\u2019t help falling for me\u2026with the help of a walkthrough, anyway. (Sadly, I have a rotten personality and can never self-insert.)[/h1]\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=506376209\n\nHey look, otome fans: it\u2019s Amnesia in English on Steam! Those who have been desperately hoping for an English localization of Amnesia (and may even be veterans of the Not-So-Civil Dialoveable-Amnesiac War) will probably get this regardless of reviews. I may just be writing this for my own amusement, but hey, why not? Maybe there's someone on the fence.\n\n...Or in a cage.\n\nLike many of the Japanese games making their way to Steam now, Amnesia: Memories is a port. Unlike most Japanese Steam games\u2019 ports, however, this is Amnesia\u2019s English debut, alongside a simultaneous Vita release. The text is all translated into English with the Japanese voice acting intact.  Fortunately, Amnesia makes a good transition from handheld to PC. Things that may seem like annoyances at first\u2014such as being forced to left-click to progress the text\u2014are easily overcome thanks to the ability to remap keys and controller support.\n\nThe game itself looks great in 1080p as well, with easily legible text, though close-ups of characters and backgrounds suffer from minor aliasing. While the character sprites and CGs are beautiful, the backgrounds seem like stock photographs and simple line drawings with your 12-year-old cousin\u2019s favorite \u201cUnicorn Diarrhea\u201d Instagram filter applied. However, my BFF (who normally has good taste) calls them \u201cstylized\u201d and \u201cappropriate\u201d so it could just be my severe unicorn allergy speaking. \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=506379697\n\nPlus there are mini-games, so you get to beat your boyfriend(s) in air hockey and cackle maniacally at the first hint of their sad, sad anime boyfriend tears. Or if they beat you, [i]Oh my god I was playing in windowed mode and I accidentally Skyped my mom when I meant to fling the puck back at you, okay, so get over yourself, Kent.[/i] There\u2019s also Inexplicably Violent Rock-Paper-Scissors if you prefer. (I would\u2019ve enjoyed seeing additional mini-games, such as Flowerpot-Dodging or Knee-the-Yandere-in-the-Groin, but I understand that this is a visual novel first and foremost.)\n\nAmnesia is a traditional, story-focused visual novel without any stat-raising; endings are determined entirely by the series of choices you make and the parameters those choices affect. Exploring alternate realities and unraveling the mystery of your past(s) is an intriguing approach that takes precedence over the romance in most routes, and completing all five routes is necessary to reveal the full picture. I recommend seeking out the bad endings even if you\u2019re normally averse to your boyfriends hating, stabbing, or dismembering you. Then again, I probably took too much fiendish delight in finding new ways to get what\u2019s-her-face killed.\n\nEach route begins with already well-established relationships, though our heroine has to relearn (and hopefully remember) the exact nature of those relationships over one month. Having amnesia\u2019s rough\u2014even when you regain consciousness and immediately find out you have a hot boyfriend. Ikki\u2019s and Kent\u2019s routes felt like the best introduction to Amnesia\u2019s setting and made the parameters feel especially relevant to the story. There\u2019s no common route at all, so the scenes and events in each guy\u2019s route are unique.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=506377418\n\nThe love interests themselves were diverse and well-written, though how appealing the routes and characters themselves are likely comes down to personal preference. I [i]absolutely loved[/i] one route, enjoyed two very much, plodded through another because I totally already knew whodunit, and then one I fdgsffdgguyuggyhuyghgyuyuyuygugujyguyuyyujuyyhgnugngnnggyhdfrtgdhftrsgfd\n\nSorry, I must have gotten dizzy after recovering a repressed memory.\n\nIf you\u2019re expecting light, breezy romance, this isn\u2019t your best bet, but the feeling that you\u2019re one misstep away from a horrible fate is far stronger in some routes than others. Your adorable giant bug sidekick Orion serves as the game\u2019s main source of comic relief and also doubles as the heroine\u2019s personality, because she apparently lost hers with her memories. I\u2019m not a fan of \u201cblank slate\u201d visual novel protagonists (probably because of my aforementioned rotten personality), and it was off-putting that the MC doesn\u2019t speak, with Orion reacting, thinking, and narrating in her stead. Luckily, Orion is the best. THE BEST. \n\nEven taking my (exaggerated) criticisms into account, I enjoyed Amnesia very much and am thrilled that it got such a fantastic English localization from Idea Factory International. It took me 47 hours total to complete all the routes with their many endings and they were hours very well spent. I hope this is the first of many Otomate releases on Steam and I\u2019d love for Amnesia to help prove that there\u2019s a market for Japanese otome games here.\n\nOne last thing\u2014I forgot to make fun of the guys\u2019 outfits, which made them look like they all rolled out of a Hot Topic going-out-of-business sale circa 1995 and woke up in a giant barrel full of rejected Final Fantasy characters\u2019 belts decades later. There, my duty is now fulfilled; it is time for me to leave you. One day (probably today), you will forget ever reading this review\u2026\n\n[i]Note: The publisher provided each volunteer beta tester\u2014including me!\u2014with a complimentary Steam copy of the game as a thank-you for testing.

Classified as an \"otome\" (girl) game, Amnesia is equal parts fascinating and hilarious.\n\nThe game starts with your character entering a spirit world, where a being named Orion tells you that he has somehow become lodged in your consciousness, and can't leave until you recover your memories. At that point, you gain the choice of one of four different paths (with one unlockable later), and you have to make decisions over the course of the story in terms how much information you gather and who you choose to romance/hang out with.\n\nThe most interesting part of Amnesia is that there's a lot of replay value. There are five distinct storylines, each with a wildly different set of situations and stories that occur. I was part of the beta testing team for this, and was initially struck by how separate each path is. The first storyline I played through (Shin's) had the characters attempting to solve a mystery, while the second was so off-the-wall that it might qualify as a parody of visual novels.\n\nI know the opening line might seem a bit flippant, but that is the crux of the game. You can only trigger your memories by spending as much time as possible with your respective suitor(s), who have a bad habit of not revealing anything important to you until later on in the storyline.\n\nFrom a plot standpoint, Amnesia is absolutely bonkers. In a good way, of course. The novelty of being a girl trying to collect information about her missing memories is balanced by a set of off-the-wall characters. Depending on which storyline you play, you'll run into a pair of childhood friends competing for your affections (one of whom locks you in a dog cage for half of his storyline), another teen who has somehow been gifted with the ability to be attractive to every woman he sees (thus explaining why he has a harem of girls who harass the player character) and a \"Mr. Nice Guy\" tutor.\n\nThe art style really sets this apart from other visual novels. Characters are expressive, blinking, moving their mouths and speaking in full Japanese. The backgrounds are generally detailed and varied, and there are nice interstitial moments that break up each scene.\n\nThere are also a pair of minigames that can be accessed through the main menu, but I didn't spend enough time to have much of an opinion. They're very simple (rock-paper-scissors), but are a neat diversion for anyone who wants to go for high scores.\n\nIn the end, Amnesia: Memories is one of the most interesting games I've played this year, and certainly among the best visual novels I've experienced in quite some time. It's well worth a look and offers a lot of value for the money.\n\nDefinitely worth a look.", "timestamp_created": 1440529555, "timestamp_updated": 1440529555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 129, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.821943", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17713126": {"recommendationid": "17713126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070792337", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440452380}, "language": "english", "review": "[Disclaimer: In no way, shape, or form was I compensated for the composition or publication of this review. This by my own volition. A review copy of the game was kindly provided by Ideal Factory International.]\n\nDeveloped by Idea Factory under its Otome game brand Otomate, Amnesia: Memories is among one of the companies pioneering titles that finally gets a western release. And while Otoge or Otome games are meant to cater specifically toward a female audience, a male audience can also partake of them. The story puts players into the shoes of an unnamed female protagonist that has lost her memories after a strange incident. With help of mysterious young boy named Orion, the two work together to help make sense of the heroine\u2019s past life, while trying not raise suspicion from friends and a boyfriend she never knew existed.\n\nWith Amnesia: Memories actually being my first Otome game and looking that is from the perspective of a newcomer, I do think that first timers like myself or those completely new to visual novels in general will be able to navigate it easily. For one, before you even start to meet the eligible bachelors, you will be able to choose who you want to interact with from the start by choosing a world \u2013 each holding a symbolic card corresponding to that person. You have the aloof Shin of the \u201cHeart\u201d world, playboy Ikki of the \u201cSpade\u201d world, his logical best friend Kent of \u201cClub\u201d world, and the big brother figure Toma of \u201cDiamnond\u201d world. There is a fifth guy and the route that puts all this into perspective, but needs to be unlocked by completing the others. Not only do each the routes play out differently depending on the world, but also changes how certain people will treat you. For instance, Waka, the manager at the place the herione works at is very nice in the \u201cHeart\u201d route, but his personality does shift greatly in others \u2013 going from docile to abrasive. This does apply to the other characters you meet as well to varying degrees, and serves as a nice change of pace to see how each route differs despite the feature being nothing new to visual novels.\n\nEven though the main love interest and their personalities play into the typical paradigm most shoujo anime seems to reach for, I did honestly enjoy exploring the backstories of the guys I did go after. My favorite character would have to be the titular Shin, learning the reason behind his distant attitude that stems from a past event with his father. The writing is very simple in many ways and not that great when it comes to giving the story some interesting twist and turns, but still okay in its own right. The individual routes are fine on their own, but overall does fall short of being particularly great. That\u2019s all I can offer on the subject without spoiling it. By the same admission, the characters themselves also aren\u2019t as detailed as they could be, but still found them interesting. Especially in the case of Toma. Yup, very\u2026 fascinating personality shift for that guy.\n\nGetting back to gameplay, the same orthodox process of reading text and making decisions at certain points become the norm like most visual novels, with one exception. Keeping with the theme of trying to piece together your life without letting your boyfriend be any wiser, the choices you make do have implications on 3 values: \u201cAffection\u201d, \u201cTrust\u201d, and \u201cSuspicion\u201d. The goal of is to ideally get a \u201cGood\u201d or \u201cNormal\u201d ending by keeping your Affection and Trust values high and Suspicion low. Again, depending on the choices, these values will fluctuate, so it is important to be mindful of what choices you make and keep tabs on your parameter menu frequently. Often or not, it is pretty easy to know how to response, yet can abuse the system by saving your game and seeing how a certain choice goes. In the event that you do have your Suspicion high, the game will continue, but will be able to get a bad ending more easily from making a wrong choice or simply getting the normal ending for that route if you happen to make it through successfully. Since replay value is a big part of games of this nature, it doesn\u2019t hurt and obvious that making multiple saves will offer some assistance.\n\nWhen you tire of trying to get through the story or even completed the game, besides viewing the CG library for illustrations, listening to tracks, or keeping track of the endings you received, the game does have two mini-games you can play at anytime: Rock-paper-scissors and Air hockey. There not the most interesting thing in the world, but it\u2019s there if you need it as a brief diversion. I would like to detail this section, but since I never actually won a game, I will leave the outcome of what happens (if anything) to be a surprise.\n\nOn the aesthetic side of things, the artwork and animation for the game is very impressive. In a lot ways, the color scheme and style used kind of reminds me of that found in Steins;Gate, despite not having the same exact appearance or as drab. Animations are crisp and lively, and actually show off a lot of technical muscle such as changing the characters sprite angles (seeing them from the side or back) that really makes them come alive without having to go toward excess. My favorite animation would have to be of Ikki holding his signature sunglasses and smoothly slipping them on in the same scene almost like it was in one movement. The musical score is very genteel and well-done, piano pieces being the most prominent holding up the sentimental mood \u2013 that admittedly, tends get lost at various times. By the time you get through half of the routes it will become droning, yet mildly tolerable.\n\nWith visual novels gaining more acceptance and familiarity in the West, I do believe titles like Amnesia: Memories will be great boon for its biggest supporters. It definitely isn\u2019t the cream of crop, especially when it comes to the overall writing, but still fairly remarkable in other areas like presentation and making that presentation work for it during the course of the game. While it won\u2019t be for a couple of months until see Idea Factory\u2019s other Otome offerings, Amnesia is a pretty pleasant harbinger of what to expect and do think this one will keep most fans satisfied for the time being.\n", "timestamp_created": 1440528185, "timestamp_updated": 1440528185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460717", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39487842": {"recommendationid": "39487842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150047020", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1463, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1463, "last_played": 1516551990}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e21\u0e35\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e34\u0e28\u0e19\u0e32\u0e0b\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48\u0e40\u0e22\u0e2d\u0e30\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01 \u0e23\u0e39\u0e17\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e38\u0e48\u0e21\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e25\u0e30\u0e04\u0e19\u0e01\u0e47\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e23\u0e21\u0e13\u0e4c\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e01\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e22 \u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e0b\u0e49\u0e33\u0e0b\u0e32\u0e01\u0e08\u0e33\u0e40\u0e08 \u0e41\u0e16\u0e21\u0e22\u0e31\u0e07\u0e21\u0e35\u0e2d\u0e38\u0e1b\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e23\u0e04 \u0e1b\u0e31\u0e0d\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e41\u0e15\u0e01\u0e15\u0e48\u0e32\u0e07\u0e01\u0e31\u0e19\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e43\u0e19\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e25\u0e30\u0e23\u0e39\u0e17\n\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e14\u0e39\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e34\u0e40\u0e21\u0e30\u0e21\u0e32 \u0e43\u0e19\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e41\u0e23\u0e01\u0e19\u0e36\u0e01\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e08\u0e30\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e41\u0e19\u0e27\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e32\u0e19\u0e08\u0e4b\u0e32\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22 \u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e43\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e41\u0e2e\u0e30 \u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e21\u0e35\u0e01\u0e34\u0e21\u0e21\u0e34\u0e04 \u0e21\u0e35\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e34\u0e28\u0e19\u0e32\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e40\u0e23\u0e32\u0e04\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e44\u0e02\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e46 \u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e40\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e19\u0e32\u0e19\u0e1e\u0e2d\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e04\u0e27\u0e23\u0e01\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e08\u0e30\u0e08\u0e1a\u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e25\u0e30\u0e23\u0e39\u0e17\n\u0e0b\u0e35\u0e08\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e27\u0e22\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01 \u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e43\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e01\u0e47\u0e42\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e04\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22 \u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e32\u0e30\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1516466898, "timestamp_updated": 1516466898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39473488": {"recommendationid": "39473488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198799760509", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2021, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 802, "last_played": 1516566652}, "language": "english", "review": "Watched the anime first and then bought this game when it was 90% off.

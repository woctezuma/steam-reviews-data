However that does lead me to what bugged me about this game at first. Stats did not change through experience points rather you bought your stat point upgrades. It is something that you have to get used to. I rather enjoy it now as it has a bit more for me to think about instead of me rushing in head first with little thought.\n\nShort story is I will recomend this game as it is a fun little gem.

The map design can't be overstated, either. Every room is crammed with stuff to find and interact with, and the constant threat of (lightning-fast) random encounters draining your health adds tension to your exploration. The game has a very simple stat system, but the resource that upgrades your combat performance also upgrades your exploration skills, so deciding between one more point of Defense to survive a little longer and one more point of Agility to slide past those deadly lasers is very immediately meaningful.\n\nVoid Pyramid is just a fantastic, tightly woven experience that always offers more danger, more to explore, and a setting you definitely have not seen before, completely free of magic forests and military bases.", "timestamp_created": 1487046491, "timestamp_updated": 1487046491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612695", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29749516": {"recommendationid": "29749516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041760296", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483847220}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice little game lots of fun", "timestamp_created": 1486415754, "timestamp_updated": 1486415754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29726323": {"recommendationid": "29726323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053449383", "num_games_owned": 425, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 539, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486397920}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent minimalist RPG set within a very weird universe, somewhere between Final Fantasy Legend and Space Funeral. The Ancient Egyptian / Sci-Fi atmosphere mix works very well, and manages to be both creepy and hilarious. The writing is particularly good, and is kinda reminiscent of these weird 80s PnP RPG manuals or Fighting Fantasy gamebooks, with MONSTER NAMES IN CAPS and an extremely serious tone applied to the most ridiculous subjects.\n\nYour character has three \"dungeon stats\" (corresponding to the classic fighter / mage / rogue archetypes) which are used extensively through skillchecks, allowing you to explore rooms in different ways. There are optional treasures to find (which are described in detail and are a great contribution towards world-building, in a Dark Souls kind of way), and multiple endings (most of which being bad ends). Sadly, the combat is pretty barebones and usually amounts to spamming attack (or, when facing bosses, the item which allows you to attack twice), although the \"dungeon stats\" can alter the fights in a variety of ways (by allowing you to run away, killing the enemy instantly, or increasing the chances of a reward).\n\nAlthough it's not really innovative gameplay-wise, it has that sense of wonder early 8/16-bit RPGs had, which is kind of lost nowadays.\n\n+ Bizarre and fun setting\n+ Excellent writing\n+ Rewards exploration\n\n- Kinda grindy\n- Combat has very little tactical depth\n\n7/10 It's free, it's not very long, it's fun and original.

I'm super proud of what Mr. Hagen has accomplished.\n\nVoid Pyramid's design philosophy is almost paradoxical. It strips the dungeon crawler RPG elements to a minimalist, barebones approach that resembles mechanics you might find in an early to mid 80s CRPG for IBM or Apple II, with a relatively tiny game world to explore. And yet the game world is full of a densely packed and highly detailed variety of novel situations and features, NPC and narrator flavor text is taken to a high art, and the hazy history and ecology of a dismal, far-future posthuman society is yours to discover and piece together as you go along. And of course there are a lot of ways to die horribly.\n\nThe tone of the narration is simultaneously dire, morbid, flippant and occasionally hilarious. It's rare to see descriptive text that's done this well in an RPG. If you enjoy games where the graphics are chiefly symbolic and the real details are to be found in word form, this is a must try.\n\nThe combat is frequent, yet mercifully brief - both you and your foes are liable to die in 2 or 3 blows, or even 1. Only health, attack and defense stats come into play during battles, and there are no spells or special abilities, only a few consumable items at your disposal. But each fight is tense, as the damage dealt by enemies needs to be gauged closely. Misjudging a single turn in combat even if you're at mostly full health can quickly get you immediately slain by a critical hit, randomly losing some or all of your gold or items, and sent back to respawn. Even with such simple mechanics at play, the combat is very strategic; players of tough single-hero RPGs like Dragon Warrior 1 will feel right at home. (There's no autosave on death, so save scumming is totally viable if that's how you want to handle the death setbacks.)\n\nThe music and sounds together have a trippy, somewhat psychedelic feeling and add to the atmosphere of the game without being obtrusive. The graphics are minimalist but done with style and originality, with a lot of bright pastels contrasting with brown and yellow neutral tones. The monster designs are generally pretty fantastic.\n\nThe lack of gameplay depth in some areas may be a turn off for some players, as well as the retro style and rough graphical edges, but if you enjoy exploring a finely detailed game world and overcoming challenges at every turn, you need to give Void Pyramid a try.

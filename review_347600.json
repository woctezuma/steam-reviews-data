This game alone has brought me back to a genre of game I told myself I\u2019d never play again. That\u2019s how good Total Miner is.\n\nIf you in any way, shape, or form like block games, or just like being creative, get this game.

For years I've wanted to play it on the computer and have been keeping up to date on the progress since it got greenlit. \nNostalgia aside, this game is constantly being updated and gets closer to perfection every time it does. To put you in perspective, this game was orginally a small world with an almost infinite supply of surprises beneath the ground. Now it's a full blown rpg. \nWhile on the surface it looks like another shameless minecraft rip off, I can safely say that this masterpiece never has felt or played like minecraft. Because of Craig's (The Creator) dedication to the game it achived much more than minecraft has through updates. Minecraft may have come first in creation, but there are many features that Total Miner had before minecraft, for example Duel Weilding, Ingame blocks used for scripting, Multiple types of stone, customized flatworlds, hightlimit reaching the 1000s, llamas/alpacas, a craft menu and ways to find new recepies, and more that I can't think of off the top of my head because of how different the games play. \nAs well as features that minecraft eventually got after Total Miner, because this game doesn't need to keep that \"minecrafty feel\" that most devs who work on updating Minecraft often refer to, there are many features that make the world in Total Miner feel more real. These are things such as layers of rock the lower you get which you can't mine until you've gotten strong enough tools, an optional skill system that will unlock items so making the game feel more progressive, shops that you can use to buy and sell items, trees that come in all shapes and sizes, many role playing items that allow you to do things like fly, an insane amount of creatures that roam the world at night, making it almost impossible to survive without propper protection, marker blocks that you can use in creative which work like a sort of world edit to remove/build large areas quickly, I seriously can go on about the vastness of this game but instead I ask you to play it for yourself.\nRight now it's very clearly in early access when you play, although for everything I've already said I truly belive that this game will soon be flawless.", "timestamp_created": 1514565820, "timestamp_updated": 1514565820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38807578": {"recommendationid": "38807578", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183894701", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 94, "last_played": 1514533496}, "language": "english", "review": "i wish u put up dig deep and multiplayer that all i need and really confused about new menu lol and great work lol i remember i play this alot and then they stop update xbox 360 rip", "timestamp_created": 1514526685, "timestamp_updated": 1514526742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.426784", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38806871": {"recommendationid": "38806871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313037225", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 180, "last_played": 1514527412}, "language": "english", "review": "This Game is AMAZING.

Despite the game has bugs and being in EA this game is completly playable upon download. There are kinks in the game but its too be expected with being a port and an EA game. Bear with them since now they are selling it at 10$ rather than 3$ like on XBLIG they will make revenue to bring better content. \n\ndef a 10/10 for a powerful Game for having fun and tool for making games within a game. Best Voxel game out there to compete against MC, especially for being on steam only\n\n[h1] The Nostolgia [/h1]\n\nI've been with this game since XBLIG 1.1 wayy before graphical over hauls, way before you stopped spawing on a basalt 3x6 platform with two shops on it,way before the spiders got a graphical over haul and wayy before the day night cycle. back when the map seeds 666 existed for the devil, 2400 existed for night time maps and back in the time when this game was drab but fun to watch develop and be next to. after all that who-ha, came the big update, UPDATE 1.5! the multiplayer update! My friend ryan didnt really like voxel crafting games so it took some convincing to get him on it, and i convertied him into a total miner lover. Those were my good ol days. Making hardcore maps with a castle, then a business and made apartments for people who joined the server often, made a working economy that worked it self out and mining business that took off actually where we provided the blocks and stuff that people didnt wanna take the time to do so they could craft in exchange for coin. every thing was so damn fun. they came 1.6-1.8 where the changed the map lay outs, added the 3 bioms, added more MOBS like the indian (pre-1.8) and zombies, then came the djinns, trolls, orcs, the devil , (post 1.8). This game has massive nostolgia with my friends n i on being the most fun, retarded, edgy, 2spooky4mi game at times.

The game has your usual standard survival modes, creative modes, and it's very own skill system that carries across games. But where the game REALLY shines is in the creative potential of the players. \n\nIn Total Miner you can copy/paste your builds, save them and bring them to other worlds, download other people's creations, flood fill and delete and all kinds of other creative tools built into the game itself. Hands down one of the best creative building toolsets in any of the block game genre. \n\nBut it doesn't stop there, there's also a robust scripting system built into the game. Create moving platforms, secret doors, make a boss mob, create spawns, make your own hailstorm staff for players to get, make scripted dungeons the possibilites are endless. \n\nBut wait, there's more. Craig has been working on creating a quest system for NPCs to actually talk to you and have things to say about quests in a dialogue tree. \n\nBUT WAIT, THERE'S EVEN MORE. With the unique pixel system you can create your own furniture and unique pixel decor.\n\nI can't wait to see what the community does with this game.

Likely, fans of the original. It's an homage, a continuation, a preservation effort. To me, it's a love letter.

I love it because i loved making maps and hosting them and to see people playing on a map i put time and effort into. I've been through days where challenge maps were popular to skilling maps now currently deathmatch maps. I also liked the challenges to do and in return you got an NPC.\n\nsuggestions:\nMe personally i dont like the new menu and im glad there is a feature to switch to the old menu in the game but i hate it because you have keep clicking it everytime you go to the menu. I think it would be great if it stayed on the old menu until you changed it back yourself instead of having to change it everytime you go to the menus. I would also love it if the shops went back to the old menu aswell. Another suggestion is a way to bind \"T\" or \"/\" as the text button instead of going to the menu all the time. I would also like a controls section in the menu so you can customise your controls because some people might not be happy with the default controls. Im not to sure if you can do this but i would be awesome to let people transfer their xbox 360 worlds over to PC.\n\nThings i like:\nIts still the good old total miner i love! I like how there is controller support for people who prefer using a controller. I like how you can atleast change your menu back to the old one. I like hoe the game runs i've ran into no crashes and everything runs fine i haven't had any random FPS drops or framerate issues. I love the addition of mod support! Even though there is no mods right now, there will defenitly be in the future/\n\nShould you buy it?????\nIf you love building maps and playing survival alone and just want to play this game because its awesome, you should get it, its just like the 360 version but without dig deep or multiplayer yet. But if you are the kind of person to explore online worlds, host online worlds, play survival with friends, play dig deep and/or try to unlock avatars, if i was you i would wait and buy this game later on when these features have been added.\n\nI feel like if the devs dont totally abondon this game like some other early access games and get it out of early access, this game might get some attention again like itt did in 2011/12.", "timestamp_created": 1514125144, "timestamp_updated": 1514125144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567270", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38622149": {"recommendationid": "38622149", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994097323", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 25, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "last_played": 1514057775}, "language": "english", "review": "F I N A L L Y. \n\nBefore you cast this off as a Minecraft clone, though that was its original intention way back when, this game brings more to the table.

I played 2000+ hours on Xbox.\nTotal Miner Forge is one of my all-time favorite games, if not, my favorite.  \nI\u2019m not a big creative guy, but as far as I\u2019ve played, the creative tools are powerful and easy to use, and the selection of blocks far surpass other games in the same genre.  \nThe primary adventure game types (survival or dig deep) have given me some of the most exhilarating experiences I\u2019ve ever had in my life in gaming.  It sounds odd, since this is an indie game with pretty much just a single guy working on the thick of it.  But the music, the mechanics, and the late nights spent trying just to get to the next layer or rock layer all blended together to make a great experience.  \nDig Deep goes thousands of blocks down through harder and harder rock types and provide endless caves to explore and loot to find.  There\u2019s also an economy system in the adventure game types, which sounded off-putting at first, but once I played it for a while, I felt that it was necessary.  It increases the pace of the adventure without compromising the feel of it.  You could return from your long days in the deep mines with a large haul of gold doubloons and gems.  It draws strong influences from Runescape, such as skills, an economy, and technology.  \nIn my opinion, however: \nIf you\u2019re a creative junky, this game is great alone and with friends.  \nIf you\u2019re a survival junky, this game is not fun alone, but with friends, I can guarantee you will love it.  \nIt\u2019s just my opinion, remember, take it with a grain of salt!\n", "timestamp_created": 1514088688, "timestamp_updated": 1514088688, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38605822": {"recommendationid": "38605822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039927690", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 219, "last_played": 1514097668}, "language": "english", "review": "I forgot how many years ago I backed this game because it was my favorite indie game on the 360.

But as of right now, there is no multiplayer, no deep dig, and I had a few bugs trying to get it running at 1080p as well. Some button prompts are still for the Xbox 360 controller, and because of this some features like the map is completely unusable. Still though, for what is here it is fun. In fact, the survival mode actually has far more features than the last time I played it. The new UI for the PC is quite nice, and it hints at built in mod support and scripts, which should make for some interesting multiplayer worlds once people far more creative than me get their hands on them. \n\nNow, people may ask: \"Why should I play this when I have minecraft?\"\n\nWell, the simple answer is this game isn't much like minecraft outside of creative. As Fortress Craft Evolved is automation machine management simulator in the vein of Factorio, Total Miner is an exploration game in the vein of Terraria. While the gamplay is inarguably not as smooth as either Minecraft, the game simply has a lot going for it to make up for that. A real sense of progression, a market economy shop system, skill progression, and much, much more. If you want to simply write this off as a Minecraft clone that's fine, but you'd only be doing yourself a diservice by ignoring what I'm sure, once complete, will be a fantastic experience. \n\nAs of now though, I would say unless you're a hardcore fan wait a few months until the game is feature and bug complete to pick it up.", "timestamp_created": 1514086039, "timestamp_updated": 1514086039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594300", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38605048": {"recommendationid": "38605048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119511428", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 92, "last_played": 1514251550}, "language": "english", "review": "this is literally the best game\nthat has ever been made.\n\ni used to play this on the xbox 360, best indie game.", "timestamp_created": 1514085933, "timestamp_updated": 1514085933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492308", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38603799": {"recommendationid": "38603799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114145035", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 370, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 370, "last_played": 1514350783}, "language": "english", "review": "Thank you so much for getting this on PC.

This game is known for a insanely long development cycle and it shows even within the community. 1.8 on the Xbox took a serious amount of time to get done. Nonetheless, this game is amazing port to PC and has for me personally been highly anticipated. \n\nPros:\n+This is by far your best minecraft clone \n+More indepth features than similar games\n+Community is a quite positive community\n+Consistent development\n+From what I've seen day one it is a stable release. \n+Mods\n+Scripting\n+Texture mods built into the game\n\nCons:\n-Devlopment cycle is long.. really long. (This may be changed due to the different systems that are in place from microsoft to steam.)\n-Minecraft clone \n\n\nSummary:\nIf you enjoy Minecraft, you will enjoy Total Miner as this game incorporates some of what Minecraft has to offer but with its own flavor. The game itself its ok to look at but gets enhanced by the texture mods that are actually built into the game along with the dedicated supportive community that it has. The development cycles while they are long and can be frustrating to some people are quite expansive on the changes and improvments. Again for example,  the 1.8 update on the xbox took years to complete but in the end the game was not the game that it originally derived from. I am glad Studio Forge was dedicated on giving thier community what they desperately asked for a port that we all can enjoy.   \n", "timestamp_created": 1514072589, "timestamp_updated": 1514072589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516908", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38598650": {"recommendationid": "38598650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275485230", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 202, "last_played": 1514147046}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is almost exactly like how it was on Xbox 360, Even thought there's alot of Items and block missing, it's still very playable, even if there's various glitches or bugs that can be seen,\nand it's kinda funny to see the enemies fighting each others for no reason at all\nBut there's something really annoying in the pause menu, the scrolling system is totally bad\n\nI recommand this game if peoples loves Minecraft and survival\n", "timestamp_created": 1514069651, "timestamp_updated": 1514069651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497925", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38598639": {"recommendationid": "38598639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069103560", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 86, "last_played": 1514506361}, "language": "english", "review": "It was one of the best indie games on the 360 and now,it's on PC.Buy it,you won't regret it.", "timestamp_created": 1514069638, "timestamp_updated": 1514069638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38597862": {"recommendationid": "38597862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316890876", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "last_played": 1514067857}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game, but I think the menu needs to be worked on.

I felt so nolgastic as this was the game I would play when I didn't have a PC nor a potato of a laptop so I couldn't play Minecraft. When this game released on the 360 Minecraft was getting increasingly popular but wasn't available on console yet. This game was a fantasic subsitute. I haven't played much of the PC version yet so I am going to base this review of what I have played and my past expierence on the 360.\n\nFirstly, the cons. Dig Deep is not available yet but will be included in a future update. Being honest I can not remember what that is, therefore not very bothered. The controls are extremely awkward in my opinion so you have to do a lot of tweaking in the menus. Which are also very awkward. When you move your cursor the menu moves postion which is just not needed and is a terrible feature. Don't know if it does that with a controller. Biggest con, no multiplayer yet, multiplayer was the best thing about the game on console. You could play many different challenge maps and see what the community had built, therefore, annoying that is not included as of yet.\n\nNow, the postives. If you like a creative sandbox games, the creative mode is great for you. Despite a lack of blocks at the moment, there is a block called a \"Marker\". It allows you to quickly clear or fill areas which means building is much quicker than on Minecraft. You can also spawn NPC's. On console I am pretty sure they stay still but for those making a city it's nice to have people in shops etc. \n\nBear in mind this game is in early access.

Super cool!\n5) It runs well and has a TON of options and features even its first hour of early access launch\n\nHere are some reasons to hold off..\n1) It doesn't yet support online or co-op play of any kind at early access launch\n2) It may not be original enough to even support your $10, especially if you already own Minecraft\n\nAll in all though, it looks like a great new Minecraft for Steam and seems to run very well with my first quick play test.

The creative mode with its markers & script based system far surpasses any other voxel based game and the dig deep mode brings something completely new to the whole genre.\n\nIf you are a fan of the voxel based genre yet yearn for something different, then this is the game for you.

I loved playing this on 360 back in the day. I probably sunk more hours into this than I ever have on Minecraft.

That is most likely where you will spend most of your time. It's the same as Survival but has a better shine to it. \n\nWhat do I mean by \"better shine\"? Well it's really in the name. In Dig Deep the world is thousands of blocks deep. This is compensated by layered tiers with increasingly better mats to find. The cave systems are amazing, and finding blueprints is the most satisfying thing you will do in this gamemode aside from getting higher level tools etc..\n\nAnywho, I have had my say on this, and I hope this review briefly sums up the hidden gem of this game.

Sadly, back in 2015, he went Black. He wasn't online when I went online (Usually he would msg me and we would play nearly daily) as he normally would be. I wonder what happened to him for months before I converted over to PC completely.  I messaged him about this, but he was not online.

Knowing the fact that it is an early access game, it is off to a bit of a rocky start, and that's okay, it is an overall nice game, but there are a few things I would consider adding in or keep from the 360 version.\n\n-Keep in the old menu, It's nice and it suits it more than the newer one, I got confused pretty fast with it.\n-With the menu, maybe consider adding in a mouse sensitivity option. When I was playing it was a little harder to navigate because the mouse was either too fast or too slow.\n-I don't know if this is just me, but when I entered the game, I saw no option to put the game itself on fullscreen.\n-This may be in a future update, but the red dots on the compass bar on the top was really nice, maybe add that in.\n-Keep the character unlocking thing were you need to do specific tasks to unlock those characters.\n-I can't wait for Dig Deep, that was one of my favorite gamemodes in Total Miner Forge.\n-Maybe add in a way to collect crafted materials faster, trying to get wood planks from 50+ wood is slow and can get annoying pretty fast.\n-Multiplayer should be a MUST. So many people loved multiplayer on the Xbox 360 version, including me, so I HIGHLY RECOMMEND adding it in the future.\n\nOverall, this game is really great, but considering the amount of bugs that they still need to work on, I would consider waiting to purchase it until it's in a more stable state, but for bringing back so many childhood memories, It's worth the purchase. 10/10 Studio Forge, You guys are doing great!", "timestamp_created": 1515874851, "timestamp_updated": 1515874851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39318906": {"recommendationid": "39318906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276956703", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 238, "last_played": 1516079201}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a fun game i use to play back in the indie game days. been waitng on this for a couple years now and its better than ever", "timestamp_created": 1515873857, "timestamp_updated": 1515873857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39281077": {"recommendationid": "39281077", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980092367", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 31, "last_played": 1515852579}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is my childhood i played this game when i first found out the game even exist and actually played it it was lots of fun on xbox 360 and i still play it but im hoping for online multiplayer for pc hopefully soon but this game is fantastic and i think you should get it and play it for yourself unless you play it on xbox 360 love this game and adore it.", "timestamp_created": 1515765011, "timestamp_updated": 1515765011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39280213": {"recommendationid": "39280213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314610729", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "last_played": 1515544808}, "language": "english", "review": "Good stuff", "timestamp_created": 1515762456, "timestamp_updated": 1515762456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39267682": {"recommendationid": "39267682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152622549", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 235, "last_played": 1515625576}, "language": "english", "review": "before minecraft even came to the xbox360, 12 year old me wanted a good substitute. a buddy of mine showed me this game and i fell in love. take minecraft but with more mobs, items, and blocks and combine it with the skills from runescape. eversince i heard it was coming to steam i flipped out. i was so happy. now i get to play it all over again, and hopfully with the friends i played it with then once multiplayer comes back into the game. cant wait for mp and dig deep mode. 12?10. i love this game more than my childhood.", "timestamp_created": 1515711639, "timestamp_updated": 1515711639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39219216": {"recommendationid": "39219216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067307232", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 51, "last_played": 1515539918}, "language": "english", "review": "this game was literally sex on xbox360 literally OG minecraft for console and now that in came to pc i've been dying to play the game and its very unfinished atm. theres no multiplayer except local, all characters are unlocked, dig deep is not unlocked, only thing to is play survival by yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1515540104, "timestamp_updated": 1515540104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496780", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39197541": {"recommendationid": "39197541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125136110", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1924, "last_played": 1516079257}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game you can get in my opinion.

Trust me, this game is worth the money.\nEveryone compares it to minecraft, i honestly like this game more than minecraft. This game is much different and has much more to do overall. The feel is different, at least to me. I am glad the creator of this game decided to come out with it on PC. As he can probably do much more improving and updating to it. He seems to be updating quite frequently, so thats good. So if you are having doubts of buying this, buy it. because once dig deep comes back, im gonna end up pouring my life into it again.\nI personally want to thank the developer for releasing it on PC.

Failing to do so will not allow you to progress in the game with the XP system active. They also have the basic survial and creative modes that other block based games have, so you are probably thinking \"why should i purchase this game if its only selling point is a XP system?\"\n\nwell the XP system is only the tip of the iceberg my friend, TotalMiner has its own unique mode (ON THE WAY SHORTLY) called DigDeep. Dig Deep mode is kind of like your standard block game but with a twist. You have to mine the earth layer by layer finding certain ores to progress to the next layer and also discover blueprints to get better equipment\n\nOverall I Highly Recommend this game to anybody looking for a casual cheap infinte adventure.

I see this game linking with the Consle players so the community isn't seperated by PC and Consle people.\n\nCreative mode can let a person expand on not only creativity, but scripts and coding. This can make for an excellent way to build adventure worlds, or interactive worlds.\n\nSurvival can give a very different experiance. If you enable skills, it gives that vibe that Skyrim and Minecraft had a baby. Disabling skills can give a smooth normal survival feel and make players rely on items they craft and find with their own skills.\n\nThe items span very far and give a unique feel to the game as you aren't limited to just Iron and Diamonds. You can play defensively, offensively, or ranged.\n\nThe mobs are intresting. Each of them having their own levels. All of them spawn if skills are disabled. Enabling skills can make the mobs scale with you in level, making it so you won't die by a diablo on your first night.\n\nAll in all, 10/10 IGN and I r8 8/8 m8!

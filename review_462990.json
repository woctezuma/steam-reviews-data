This game, is devastating. It crushes you. It beats you so hard, you'll feel like someone just ripped out your spine. \n\nBut apparently, that's nothing bad. As a matter of fact, I can say that no game will ever get you this emotional. Even if you might end up with a horrible post-Clannad depression. Even if you want to kill yourself after playing this, I can't help but recommend it to anybody that ever wanted to know, how much life is actually worth. You see, this game will most likely completely take you apart, but still. In the end, you WILL realize, if you don't want that sadness in your own life, then you have to enjoy it as much as possible.\n\nTomoyo After is all about loss. It shows you how cruel life can be, but it also shows you that there are people that bring some light into the darkness. Yes, people like Tomoya. Always trying, always giving there best, just so others can be happy. [spoiler]And then... well the people that played it, they'll know what happens to those people sometimes. They go, one way or another. [/spoiler] But even so, what Tomoyo After is trying to say here is, you shouldn't let yourself get downed by tragedies. You always have to keep going. You have to move on, so you can expierence other happy and fun things in life. Even when it's hard, you have to keep fighting, to achive your own happiness. The happiness that can never be stolen away from you!\n\nI know, this review didn't tell you too much about Tomoyo Afters actual content, but what exactly do you expect from a Key/Visual Arts production that is labled as a Visual Novel? Anyways, I tried to explain the way I feel about this game and why, to me, it's the most beautiful piece of art ever created. \nPeace out.

Tomoya really shines in this VN, it shows how he grew up from Clannad, his attitude and determination, sometimes even has a change of position from Tomoya to Tomoyo, it is a interesting twist that really surprised me. \n\nI would divide this game in two sections, one is focus on Tomoya, the other Tomoyo, it is interesting, by the end of the story you really buy Tomoyo as a character if you did not bought before, because what makes a good story, its good characters, and Tomoyo delivered, i never were that big of a fan of Tomoya but after, this character is my God. \n\nAt the end of the day, there isnt much to say about it, just some points here and there but if you like Clannad or Tomoyo/Tomoya in general, well, you probably already bought, but something to point it out as a music nerd its the OST, Key always destroys in OST, just by entering in the menu, 1 minute in, you're on the ground crying and your mother thinks you're weird. This game its a testament of whats true love, not that bullshit you see in movies or novels, love its not about being romantic, its about loyalty, unshaken belief and companionship.\n\nAnd by the way, if you are a fan of Sunohara, he has if i'm not mistaken, just one scene and one dialog, but it was the dialog that broke my heart the most, what a sad world it is Clannad.", "timestamp_created": 1510703659, "timestamp_updated": 1513120259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36405792": {"recommendationid": "36405792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069619221", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510423160}, "language": "english", "review": "Tissues required. 10/10\n\nFor those Clannad fans that want to experience the continued story of Tomoyo and Tomoya.

The beginning of the game shows this most glaringly. I think I mainly found it hard to believe since almost barely any time has passed since the end of the original route, so in theory the characters should be much more familiar than they are. Tomoya is a lot more forward and kinda pervy in the beginning, and Tomoyo is much more girly and has mostly lost her tomboy-ish charm. She also basically ingnores Tomoya for a good portion of the game when a certain character is introduced, which is odd considering the game seems like it wants to setup the continuation of their romance and life together. I got over it pretty quickly, but I had just finished Tomoyo's Route for the first time the previous day before starting this game, so it was a little offputting.\n\nWhich brings me to my other big problem with the game, (and I feel like CLANNAD and Air seem to have this problem as well) which is that a lot of the depressing and bad things that happen to the characters kind of fell like they are there simply because they CAN happen, rather than whether or not the SHOULD happen. I'm not saying that everything needs to always be tied up in a nice bow by the time the credits roll, but overall it feels like the the final overall tension in the plot is somewhat forced rather than organic.\n\nExample: The tension in the original Tomoyo Route in CLANNAD makes perfect sense given what you know about Tomoya and Tomoyo by that point, so all the drama and strife that complicates their relationship and how they respond to it makes perfect sense and is totally believeable (In fact, Tomoyo's original Route is probably the most realistic/believeable one in CLANNAD). \n\nThose are my main issues, other than that, it is actually a really fun ride just watching Tomoya's everyday life. The side characters are decent and fun to talk to, if not lacking a little depth. The final arc of the True Ending was actually quite touching and very enjoyable, but again, I felt the actual final moments of the game with a bit half-baked and forced. In most of the endings it seemed like they were going for a \"bittersweet\" vibe, but really ended up feeling a bit abrupt and unsatisfying. Specifcally, the final CG \"cutscene\" quickly runs through a lot of really important threads that could have maybe just been expanded on in 2-3 normal VN gameplay moments to make a little less rushed.\n\nThe best thing I can say about it is that the True Ending will surely make you feeling something about it, whether that's good or bad. The overall normal day to day characters interactions are really good, but lacks some side character depth when compared to the original game.\n\nI'm also not going to comment on the Dungeons and Takifumis (D&T) JRPG mode because A). I haven't tried it yet, and B). it's not the reason I got the game.\n\nUltimately, it's more CLANNAD if that's what you are looking for (which I totally was), but I personally was hoping for a little better execution of it, given how excellently done the original Route this is game is based of was.

No spoilers shall be left in the comments please. This is something you have to see for yourself. So no peeking at spoiler stuff.\n\n[h1] Main Game [/h1]\nI am going to leave this short by saying you need to play this for yourself to understand everything. As words cant express how amazing this story was. However don't expect it to be a long one like Clannad. As this focus on one story alone. However I will say short can be better than long and in this case; Key have done it right. Nothings dragged out and everything you see has a purpose. Treat this like an alt universe to Clannad.\n\nThere are mutiple ways this story can end. Can you find them all :D\n\n[h1]Dungeons and Takafumis[/h1]\nFor this version of Tomoyo After it is unlocked from the beginning meaning you can go and dive stright into this. For other versions you had to choice certain options with Takafumis. (I don't remenber how you do this however someone will have put up a guide on unlocking this if you play a different version that doesn't give you Dungeons and Takafumis stright away)\n\nThis is a game within a game (Inception within Inception) and you play 4 of the 5 main characters as you try to clear a certain amount of floors to defeat a bad guy (I will also add that Fuko is in this however havent figured out how to get her). Takafumi will guide you through the game giving pointers and suggestions at the beginning. I havent played enough to give a great detail however it is confusing as it is fun (If I remenber there is 50 floors to beat, this will be updated when confirmed). It is styled like dungeons and dragons sort of with other elements of RPG's and Turn Based Strategys. You will get more time out of this game with this if your looking at original price to hours.\n\n[h1]Overall Judgement[/h1]\nIs it worth it? Yes. If your a fan of visual novels this is a game you shouldn't miss out on. I would recommend this to people who are looking into visual novel regardless that this is a continuation of Tomoyo's route from Clannad (Yes i've stated that this is an alt universe however so are all of the routes of Clannad apart from the main one).

Key is infamous for their (nukige) heart-wrenching stories and they certainly don't skimp on the drama here. The focus for most of the game lies upon newly introduced characters, giving everyone at least one arc. \n\nThere are a handful of decisions that seem out of character for the protagonist, but he does come to realize his mistakes and reflect upon them. The actual choices given to the player are minimal and generally have obvious outcomes. A couple choices work counter-intuitively though, so don't fret over keeping a guide open to prevent yourself from getting an abrupt bad end.\n\nEvery arc connects to one another in a fluid narrative with one exception. The final arc marks a massive shift and while the transition is rough the content is well worth experiencing. Just be sure to have read the original Clannad before diving in. \n\n[b]Visual[/b]\nA remarkable improvement from the portrait art in the prequel, even the gallery images are smartly drawn. Recycled assets are sprinkled among the newly drawn backgrounds. \n\n[b]Sound[/b]\nNot as impacting as its predecessor, but what can possibly compare to it? The same artists worked on music in both games, so expect more somber, foreboding melodies to rain down upon you.\n\n[b]Four stars out of five[/b]\nThe story meanders a bit since the focus is split between so many different characters.

Even at the cost of being almost completely disconnected from the rest of the visual novel, it ties in perfectly with Clannad, which is something the core story of Tomoyo After seemed to go out of its way to avoid at every opportunity. The premise is familiar, but not the roles. Characters regain the qualities that made them likable in the first place. The Tomoyo route comes full circle and gets as satisfying of a conclusion as possible given the nature of the setting. The only criticisms are that it's relatively brief and it wasn't better integrated into the rest of the story.\n\t[*][b]Dungeons and Takafumis side-game[/b] --- A small, turn-based RPG featuring the characters from the visual novel is available as optional content from the main menu.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n\t[*][b]Story[/b] --- Uninteresting and at times forced by way of characters being blatantly written as unnaturally oblivious and passive for the sake of drama. One plotline is proven meaningless upon conclusion despite some stretching to justify the whole misunderstanding. Another passes by so quickly and changes absolutely nothing for the characters involved, it may as well not have taken place.\n\n\tDuring the rare moments when the story is at its best, it's on par with the Clannad visual novel's weakest routes. The theme of family that is core to the series is there, but is severely underdeveloped. It's a poorly planned and executed story with misplaced focus on the wrong characters and problems. Up until the sudden turn of events towards the end, it was easy to be misled into thinking the story would conclude the same way.\n\t[*][b]Characters[/b] --- The main character from Clannad and Tomoyo return, although they sometimes act out of character. The brother that was a motivating factor behind the Tomoyo route becomes a permanent addition while receiving some elaboration on his past. The other few, new characters aren't compelling. One is an annoyance that not only lacks any sort of character growth but also actively detracts from the story at crucial moments, dragging it back down before it can accomplish anything.\n\n\tNew characters receive poor presentation as they barge in with introductions all the while established characters put up feigned resistance to give the illusion of agency as the story pushes forward.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nHaving considered the Tomoyo storyline to be one of the best routes in Clannad, reading through the majority of Tomoyo After was disappointing. Given her situation in Clannad, it was natural for her relationship with the main character to grow impersonal as the story progressed. Retreading that path here with the role reversal could have worked, but without the engaging characters and story, it failed to be entertaining from the onset. That is up until the ending, where out of nowhere the story finally meets and exceeds all original expectations. If the journey had been anywhere near as great as the destination, Tomoyo After would have been an easy recommendation. Looking at the work as a whole, the ending alone isn't enough to make up for the slog getting there.\n\nAt a length of about [b]11 hours[/b] without taking the optional Dungeons & Takafumis RPG into account, only those that have at least completed the Tomoyo route in Clannad and enjoyed it immensely should consider picking up Tomoyo After.

Tomoya pracuje w warsztacie, gdzie naprawia sprz\u0119d AGD, mieszka \"na swoim\" i wolny czas sp\u0119dza z ukochan\u0105, oraz jej niesfornym bratem. W pewnym momencie, ich zycie przewraca si\u0119 o 180 stopni...by nie ociera\u0107 si\u0119 o spojlery, napisz\u0119 tylko, i\u017c ca\u0142a historia, kt\u00f3ra tutaj jest opowiedziana, zakrawa o surrealizm. Wszystko dzieje si\u0119 \"nagle\" i z dnia na dzie\u0144 zaburza spokojny rytm \u017cycia wszystkich bohater\u00f3w. Dalej s\u0105 ju\u017c tylko emocje i wi\u0119cej emocji. Powiem wprost - kiedy gracz my\u015bli, \u017ce ju\u017c wszystkie \u0142zy uroni\u0142, \u017ce to ju\u017c wszystko, \u017ce bardziej wstrz\u0105\u015bni\u0119tym by\u0107 si\u0119 ju\u017c nie da - Tomoyo After uderza znienacka z drugiej strony z jeszcze wi\u0119ksz\u0105 dawk\u0105 emocji i \u015bciska serca do samego ko\u0144ca. Po niemrawym wst\u0119pie, kt\u00f3ry ma chyba u\u015bpi\u0107 nasz\u0105 czujno\u015b\u0107 otrzymujemy tak\u0105 bomb\u0119, kt\u00f3ra moim zdaniem ma silniejsz\u0105 moc ni\u017c sam Clannad.\n\nOwszem, nie mamy tu zbyt wielu wybor\u00f3w, \u015bcie\u017cek - ale pami\u0119ta\u0107 trzeba, \u017ce to nie ta sama skala, co Clannad. Tutaj otrzymujemy histori\u0119 kr\u00f3tsz\u0105, z mniejsz\u0105 ilo\u015bci\u0105 \u015bcie\u017cek - ale za to z wi\u0119kszym nat\u0119\u017ceniem emocji.

Nie ma tu wielkiej filozofii - wybory s\u0105 proste i logiczne.  \n\nW kwestii technikali\u00f3w, tw\u00f3rcy nie ustrzegli si\u0119 kilku liter\u00f3wek, ale nie ra\u017c\u0105 one w oczy. Muzyka jak zwykle subtelna i trafnie dobrana do sytuacji. Voice acting r\u00f3wnie\u017c. Malkontenci przyczepi\u0105 si\u0119 do delikatnie zmienionego designu bohater\u00f3w - mi to nie przeszkadza\u0142o w zabawie ani troch\u0119.  Czytania mamy na oko\u0142o 20 godzin, ale to nie koniec zabawy. Otrzymujemy  mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107 zagrania w tzw.

W wersji steam D&T dost\u0119pne jest od samego pocz\u0105tku w menu, gdzie we wcze\u015bniejszej wersji, trzeba by\u0142o uko\u0144czy\u0107 ca\u0142\u0105 fabu\u0142\u0119 i w kolejnym podej\u015bciu do gry dotrze\u0107 do konkretnego momentu, w kt\u00f3rym owa minigra jest odblokowywana. \n\nCo jeszcze? Co jeszcze mo\u017cna powiedzie\u0107 o tytule, kt\u00f3ry w 95% skupia si\u0119 na fabule, a my nie mo\u017cemy jej zdradza\u0107?

Tomo too, she feels like somewhat of a missed opportunity because her character arc didn't have a definitive \"end\" in my opinion...\n\nTo be frank, this game has flaws, many of which are prevalent, however I feel the end completely made up for everything the game didn't accomplish, it truly does conclude in such a unique and definitive way, that honestly I just can't describe it in a way that does it justice, this is a game that must be played if you are a fan of the original, there are simply just too many things to touch upon that set this apart from the original and other Visual Novels I have played in the past. To say this was a great experience does not truly show my true feelings about the narrative, it was beyond that, it was beautiful...

It's long, and the true route (After Story) is one of the most influential stories I've read, truly changing me as a person.\n\nThough out of all the praise I have for CLANNAD, there's one thing that really bugged me when reading. That was the differing quality between routes. Out of the 10 routes, there were about 7 that I found to be truly great. \n\nThat may not seem bad, but when one of the routes that I found lacking ended up being a main heroine route, I can't help but feel disappointed. In case you couldn't tell, I think that Tomoyo's route is the weakest out of the 5 main routes. My main complaint is that not much happens in it. The drama is a little difficult to get through, and the first half drags on a bit much. Not to mention, Tomoyo didn't get much development, at least compared to the other heroines.\n\nWhat a great thing, then, that Tomoyo recieved her very own game a year later.\n\n[h1]Details[/h1]\n\nFull Title: Tomoyo After ~It's a Wonderful Life~\n\nReleased: 25th November 2005\n\nStudio: Key\n\nScenario: Jun Maeda\n\nLength: 10-15 hours\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nWe follow Tomoya Okazaki once again, but this time he's graduated from school, has his own job and lives in an apartment. Kinda like After Story, but the difference is that he is with Tomoyo this time. \n\nShe doesn't live with Tomoya, but she and her brother, Takafumi (Best character) always visit Tomoya.\n\nIt turns out that Tomoyo has a half sister from her father's side, called Tomo (coincidence?). Tomoyo and Tomoya end up looking after Tomo due to Tomo's mother being ill, and so begins the beautiful story. I won't go further than that Synopsis, because I really don't want to spoil a single thing about this VN.\n\nThe Visual Novel has a few routes, though it is rather linear. There aren't any branching paths like other Visual Novels, rather the choices either continue the story or lead to a bad ending. This works in the Visual Novel's favour because of the length. It's about 15 hours long, and never slows it's pacing.\n\nIt feels more like an anime, because it goes from one route to another in a linear fashion. It's such an enjoyable experience.\n\nThe final arc in this Visual Novel, titled 'After' is absolutely a Masterpiece. Not only is it a throwback to the original CLANNAD, it is also a beautifully disheartening epilogue that will stay with you for a long time after you've finished it.\n\nThe ending is nothing short of incredible. If you can actually read the final text through all your tears, you will realise that it is open ended, as it doesn't give a definitive answer as to what happened. I've said it before, but these are my favourite types of endings. Ones where I can speculate as to what happened; where I can interpret it in my own way. \n\nLuckily, there has been a Steam release which has no H-Scenes. The steam version also contains full voice acting for Tomoya, which is awesome. I strongly recommend buying the Steam version if you want the best experience, especially if you don't like eroge. \n\nI think that without the H-Scenes, this story is almost flawless, and it it one of the best stories in any Key Visual Novel.\n\n[h1]Characters[/h1]\n\nAnother thing that this Visual Novel does right is character development. There aren't many, but this means that they all get fleshed out extremely well. Even the ones that appear towards the end are great.\n---\n[h1]Tomoya Okazaki[/h1]\n\nCome on, we all know who Tomoya is! He's the main character. He's sarcastic and cynical. CLANNAD taught Okazaki what it means to live, but with Tomoyo After, his development is almost the complete opposite. I like the fact that they changed how he grows as a character, because it shows us another side to him that we didn't see in the original.\n---\n[h1]Tomoyo Sakagami[/h1]\n\nOur main heroine, and the titled character. I always thought that Tomoyo was extremely overrated, because she was kinda flat and boring in CLANNAD. Tomoyo After completely changed my opinion on her. Her decisions in this VN are... Questionable, but she has a lot of depth. Seeing her selfishness is detestable, though I feel that's what Jun Maeda intended.\n---\n[h1]Takafumi Sakagami[/h1]\n\nHands down, Takafumi is one if my favourite characters in all of CLANNAD. We knew a little about him in the original. We learned that he jumped off of a bridge, and became injured. Luckily he is no longer in a wheelchair here. I was a bit confused at first, but then I was like 'that's Takafumi?!' He's kind of the comic relief character but he's not dumb like Sunohara.\n\nThere are segments in this Visual Novel where you are sat in your apartment and get to choose which characters to speak to, and I always went to Takafumi.\n---\n[h1]Mishima Tomo[/h1]\n\nThe aforementioned half sister to Takafumi and Tomoyo. She's sees Tomoyo and Tomoya as her parents, as her real mother sort of dumped her with them. Even though she is aware of her mother's condition, she simply wants to be with her. Tomo is the main focus for most of the story, and Tomoya has a real bond with Tomo.\n---\n[h1]Kanako[/h1]\n\nYou can't not have a Tsundere in a Visual Novel. Joking aside, she's great. She may or may not know Takafumi from the past. I'll just say that she shares her route with him. She ran away from home because why not and lives in the Okazaki household because... Why not?\n\n[h1]Art[/h1]\n\nThis Visual Novel came out in 2005. 2005!!! It looks incredible. Little Busters always gets praise for being ahead of its time, but this came out 2 years earlier and arguably looks even better. I can't stress enough how beautiful this Visual Novel is. Ignore the fact that it has a 800x600 resolution; it geniunely looks better than most anime that comes out nowadays.\n\nThe backgrounds are beautiful, and whilst some are recycled from CLANNAD, the new ones are incredibly detailed. Tomoya looks a bit odd though...\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n\nThe soundtrack is great. I think it's a given that a Key work will have great music, but I still have to mention it. As for the Voice Acting, it's also great. The fact that Tomoya is voiced (by the same person who did his voice in the anime) in the steam version is also a great thing.\n\nI am a big fan of the Opening, (who isn't), and the ending song still makes those tears start flowing O_O\n\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\n\nPlease, for the love of god, play the steam \nversion! It's so much better. It has a few extra scenes, cuts out the H-Scenes and has voice acting for Tomoya. If you don't happen to play the steam version for whatever reason, just skip through the first hour.

Most notably, in the first five minutes of the game, she's making \"nyaaaaaaa\" sounds and wearing silly outfits. But this was originally an eroge, after all, and the novel HEAVILY subverts this pandering later on so whatever. Other than that, though, her CLANNAD character traits are a little flanderized and exaggerated so she can come off as totally stupid sometimes in Tomoyo After.\n\nTo top it off, one of the major characters is really forgettable and completely annoying [spoiler](kanako is the jar jar binks of KEY. takafumi was right to dump that thot).[/spoiler]\n\nHowever, if you came for more CLANNAD content and an oversized feels bomb that'll smash your soul with a 25-pound sledgehammer, you'll get that here. Besides the aformentioned issues the writing is top-tier KEY. Tomoya is a stronger character than ever. There are tracks here that are actually god-tier and WILL make you weep. And you get more Tomoyo, even if she's a bit worse for wear.\n\nIf you don't want to spend money, though, go look up the Tomoyo After manga. It's from Tomoyo's perspective and, honestly, I find the manga's version of her more fitting than the VN's.

As the title suggests, it's Tomoyo's After Story. Comparisons and contrasts will inevitably be drawn with the parent visual novel's penultimate chapter. Regardless, Tomoyo After holds up remarkably well. It may not reach the heights of After Story, but it is about as close as you could feasibly get.\n\nTomoyo After takes place soon after the ending of Tomoyo's story in Clannad. Having resolved to spend their lives together, Tomoya works a modest job at a plant that collects broken parts and re-purposes them for better use (a subtle parallel to how Tomoya himself hopes to make better of his withered husk of a life up until now). Tomoyo visits him every day after school in his apartment. After a disappointing prologue that does little but objectify Tomoyo, the plot kicks off when Tomoyo's younger brother, Takafumi, drops some startling news on their couple; Tomoyo's father had a daughter named Tomo prior to his reconciling with his wife, and her mother has mysteriously vanished. \n\nFrom this point on, Tomoya and Tomoyo adjust to the stunning realization that they are now surrogate parents to this child in their own unique ways. Tomoyo easily slides into the role of a parent, bonding easily with Tomo by showering her with love and affection. Tomoya, initially a passive player in this change of events, hopes to prove he has both initative and resolve by finding a way to deal with an old flame of Tomoyo's by himself. Without getting in to too much detail, Tomoya admittedly decides to take some very irresponsible risks in this portion of the story, but the purpose of him doing so is laid out effectively by Maeda. Many may not find fault with it at all.\n\nIt's around this point that Tomoyo After shines. Our five main characters (Tomoya, Tomoyo, Takafumi, Tomo, and Takafumi's ex, Kanako) are an endearing group of leads who play off each other very well. Kanako's vulgar frankness interacts nicely with Tomoya's quirky imagination and contrasts effectively with Tomoyo's straight-laced, matter-of-factness. Tomoya and Takafumi's bond as brothers is also portrayed organically, with the two ribbing each other in a good-natured, heartwarming manner. Regardless of their differences, all of the cast members love Tomo and wish only the best for her. The interesting tension this causes about halfway through the story is one of the most compelling parts of the story.\n\nThe much-discussed After arc of the story is worthy of its fame. It's thought-provoking, true to the characters involved, and deeply emotional. I have a feeling it will stick with me almost as long as After Story will.\n\nFor some much needed levity, the game allows you to play an RPG minigame, Dungeons and Takafumis, a surprisingly complex and lengthy bonus that delivers good humor and (for better or for worse) challenging game design. At level 35, I've yet to finish it :P.\n\nTomoyo After is another solid entry from Japan's best visual novel company. If you enjoyed Tomoyo's arc in Clannad, then I would recommend this game in a heartbeat.\n\n4.5/5\n", "timestamp_created": 1474774516, "timestamp_updated": 1474774516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25633056": {"recommendationid": "25633056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148120781", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 4420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479931735}, "language": "english", "review": "Come for Tomoyo & Tomoya, stay for Dungeons & Takafumis.\n\nIf it's been said before, it's because it's true.\n\n[EDIT 24 November for Steam Award:] \nDungeons & Takafumis (D&T) is a minigame within Tomoyo After that is straightforwad to play and somewhat difficult to master. D&T is like a tactical RPG, except you can only give orders at the start of a battle. Once the battle starts, you lose all control of your characters - they will move around the map to follow those orders (mostly for the best, but not always). Besides the orders, you control character starting position, equipped gear, and stat growth via allocating growth points and changing jobs. \n\nThe relatively small number of options under the player's control makes D&T straightforward to play. The difficulty is that the equipment won at the end of a battle is random. The Random Number God might give you what you need when you need it, or forsake you. The challenge in D&T is to win all battles within an in-game time limit by optimising your orders, starting positions and stat growth, while making the best use of the randomised equipment.", "timestamp_created": 1474541774, "timestamp_updated": 1479933349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.433708", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25507419": {"recommendationid": "25507419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120806889", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 14117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483167674}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u8001\u5a46\uff0c\u5f53\u7136\u8981\u4e70\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1473924165, "timestamp_updated": 1473924165, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504681", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25484174": {"recommendationid": "25484174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041024658", "num_games_owned": 1291, "num_reviews": 112, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495637180}, "language": "english", "review": "I should give this game a not recommend.\n\nCons:\nUnlike Clannad, this game didn;t receive an HD upgrade.\nThe original version is 18X and thus Steam Version ,like the original one ,used a different CV than the one who was in Clannad.\n\nPros:\nClannad Series\nDeveloper: VisualArts/Key\n\n\nSHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY", "timestamp_created": 1473711205, "timestamp_updated": 1473711205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.280241", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25482005": {"recommendationid": "25482005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208658955", "num_games_owned": 1052, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474032244}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u667a\u4ee3after\u51fasteam\u5361\u7247\u4e86\uff0c\u60f3\u5408\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u8d76\u7d27\u4e70\u4e70\u4e70", "timestamp_created": 1473701840, "timestamp_updated": 1473701840, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25477413": {"recommendationid": "25477413", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982210063", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510538919}, "language": "english", "review": "A good alternate story away from the main story of CLANNAD which provides readers a touching story about perseverance and determination.

It's not enough to take you out of the story, but it's enough to make return players feel like something's off.\n\nBut still, I'm recommending this. Why? Because no other game has had me sitting up at 2 in the morning, shaking my monitor, yelling \"GIVE ME MY HAPPY ENDING OR I'LL CUT YOU!\".

if you followed Tomoyo's route (which you should have, it is the best route in my opinion)\n\nThis visual novel has funny, likeable characters and a great story. While the VN is not as long as Clannad (explains the low price in comparison) It does have multiple routes you can follow to get many different endings based on the choices you make.\nI, for one, am glad they decided to bring this to Steam. I did own the uncensored H-version originally, and I decided to uninstall that in favor of this one, as in my opinion, the H-scenes add nothing to the game and honestly make Tomoyo and Tomoya act drastically out of character. The alternate scenarios they used to replace the scenes are more enjoyable and some made me laugh (If I want porn, that's what google is for. I can live without it in my reading materials thank you).\n\n\nAll in all this is well worth the full price, and even better on sale (was $15 on launch with the 20% discount).\nI can't reccommend this game enough, sadly there's only a thumbs up and not a big flashing neon YES! button.\n\nIf you decide this isn't the kind of game for you, that's fine. Hopefully you find one that suits you.\n\nIf you like romance, Clannad/Little Busters!/KARAKARA/ and Tomoyo after is a good choice.\n\nMystery/Detective? Steins;Gate(not on steam at the time of this review) and even most definitely Danganronpa 1+2 are excellent choices.\n\nAction? Fault;Milestone 1 and 2.\n\n\n\nFeel free to add me if you have any questions or just wanna chat it up.

Tomoyo After ~It's a Wonderful Life~ is finally on Steam! The tagline for this visual novel has been on my Steam profile description for as long as I can remember and while this VN is short, it has a powerful impact which I think is much more powerful than CLANNAD. Even so, CLANNAD and Tomoyo After still works on the same premise: the importance of family.\n\nTomoyo After ~It's a Wonderful Life~ is the spin-off to the highly acclaimed visual novel CLANNAD which picks up where Tomoyo route ended in CLANNAD. Developed by Key back in 2005, this VN was originally released as 18+ eroge thus why the voice actor for Tomoyo is different and the art direction is slightly different than how it was in CLANNAD. This time around Key didn't use Sekai Project to publish their game, instead they publish it under VisualArts brand while the translation is handled by another company using Doki's translation as a base (probably). Nevertheless, thx based Doki.\n\nTomoyo After picks up few months after Tomoyo's route ended in CLANNAD. Tomoya now works in a local workshop fixing home appliance while Tomoyo is now in her Senior Year. After the problem between Tomoya and Tomoyo in CLANNAD, the couple promise to be more forward with each other so they can overcome all the problem in life no matter how hard it is. One day, Takafumi, Tomoyo's younger brother, brought a young girl named Tomo which turns out to be the sibling's illegal stepsister. Takafumi, not wanting the Sakagami family to be torn apart again, decided to make Tomo live with Tomoya. Tomo is living happily with Tomoyo and Tomoya, despite that she still wants to be with her mother, thus began the journey to find Tomo's mother and the reason why she abandons Tomo to the Sakagami family.\n\nWithout giving too much spoilers, Tomoyo After follows on its tagline [b]\u300cLet's look for the treasure of life\u300d[/b] by taking us on a journey of how Tomoyo overcoming her weakness with the help of Tomoya while Takafumi have to face the consequences of what he had done in CLANNAD and the burden that his choice has put upon him. Tomoya himself also wants to prove that he is no longer the person that he was back in his high school days and show the world that the love between him and Tomoyo are [b] eternal [/b] and cannot be broken by anything for their power of love will overcome all troubles.\n\nThe art for Tomoyo After was directed mainly by Fumio and not by Hinoue, thus why Tomoyo looks similar but visibly different from how she was in CLANNAD. While Hinoue might not be the main art director like how she was in CLANNAD, she still helps with the character design. Everything else was handled in-house by Key with another notable thing to note is that Kashida Leo, a new scenario writer for Key, helped Maeda Jun in making the scenario for Tomoyo After.\n\nThe VN will take about 15-20 hours to finish depending on your reading speed. The VN alone is worth the current pricetag that it carry. But it doesn't stop there! As if the epic closure for Tomoyo story is not enough, they put an icing on the cake with Dungeon & Takafumi! A tactical role-playing game centered around the game that Takafumi is currently developing along with his overseas friend. It is time consuming and quite fun once you get the hang of it plus it has its own story centered around Takafumi and Kanako, Takafumi's girlfriend. On that note, I kinda dislike the fact that the Steam version lets you to play D&T even when starting Tomoyo After for the first time instead of unlocking it through the choice that you made while conversing with Takafumi in the VN.\n\nSince this VN has many revision and re-release, I actually managed to read this VN multiple times across multiple version across multiple console. I will list all the edition here + the platform I read them on while also adding a comparison of what each version have and don't have.\n[olist]\n[*][b]The Original release[/b]: Played on PC, 18+ eroge.\n[*][b]CS (Consumer Software) Edition[/b]: Played on PS3, All-Ages. Retconned the \"bad\" ending in Original release because everyone hates it while adding voice acting for Tomoya. I prefer the Original release ending rather than the retconned ending since it delivers a much more impactful ending than the one in CS Edition but I guess everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Also I never platinum this Edition because I don't like playing RPG on my couch.\n[*][b]Memorial Edition[/b]: Played on PC, this edition is basically CS Edition but for PC since the CS Edition only released on console.\n[*][b]Perfect Edition[/b]: Played on PC, includes all the content in Memorial Edition with added 18+ scene, but removed Tomoya's voice acting.\n[*][b]English Edition[/b]: Played on PC via Steam. This Edition is based on the Memorial Edition of Tomoyo After. [b][u]Remember[/u][/b], this is [u][i]English Edition[/i][/u] so it make sense that it won't be translated to other language.\n[/olist]\n\nClosing my review, I strongly suggest that you read CLANNAD before picking up Tomoyo After or at least have watched Tomoyo-hen otherwise you will be lost as to what is going on in the story. This visual novel is definitely a must have if you're love Tomoyo like I am or if you want to delve further into the CLANNAD universe.", "timestamp_created": 1467622931, "timestamp_updated": 1480071100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 88, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.877563", "comment_count": "17", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24070725": {"recommendationid": "24070725", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999204821", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480485914}, "language": "english", "review": "Sorry Nagisa but Tomoyo has always been my favorite waifu\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for the thumbs up!

It's more or a less a \"What if\" scenario if Tomoya had formed a relationship with her instead of Nagisa. So yes, it is highly recommended you play her route from Clannad first before playing this game. It will really help you to understand the characters background, and other characters that were mention in her route in Clannad and make an appearance in Tomoyo After. \n\nNow I must say, Tomoyo is a more independent charismatic character compared to Nagisa. Now I like both characters, but Tomoyo is far more enjoyable. Tomoya and Tomoyo have some really good exchanges in dialogue that really make the relationship feel \"real\". The supporting cast is interesting as well, with plenty of time given to them for their subplots to have satisfying conclusions, while also adding to the main plot of the story. \n\nAlso, my favourite part of the game is the soundtrack. My favourite song being the main title theme song called \"Hope\", and its played a few times throughout of the entire game. If your heart strings get pulled when you think of Dango Daikazoku from Clannad, then just prepare that they will be ripped entirely when you finish the game and listen to Hope. Honestly, this is strongly based on my opinion but I think Tomoyo After has very amazing ending that really will pulse out a large array of emotions towards you. It is in many ways, bitter sweet. \n\nSo yes! If you are a VN fan, and certainly a Clannad fan, pick this game up for sure. It will not disappoint, it is truly amazing, and 100% my favourite VN to date.

I'd also like to mention, while it has absolutely no inkling on the Steam version, another thing that contributes to the jarring nature of this is at least the KNOWLEDGE that the original was an 18+ game.

Just wow. I been hearing for a long long time that Tomoyo After It's a Wonderful Life is a very bittersweet but powerful story and I kept those thoughts to heart, and finally after finishing Clannad and Clannad Side Stories I finally got to experience this and I have to say right now: this got me right in the heart in a more stronger way than Clannad did. Little backstory this is a vn based on after the events of Tomoyo's path in Clannad but this might be a spoiler to say but just in case you wish to know: there is only 1 or 2 mentions of characters from Clannad in this and some references to Tomoyo's events in there too. Other than that I do believe you could still give this a read even if you have not read Clannad yet or ever (though I highly recommend you do cause they are great).  I think my only negatives about Tomoyo After is there wasn't much characters in this like less than 5 or 6 compared to Clannad and it's not a short vn but about like half as long as Clannad like you could finish this in less than 9 to 10 hours or even 5. But I don't think those would damage the experience cause the story itself overall I think was well written but as I alluded it's very tragic and bittersweet which kinda makes sense cause I believe Jun Maeda his original vision for Clannad was to have a tragic and bittersweet end to the story but his colluges talked him into writting a happy ending to Clannad which I think was fair but that's a debatable topic so no need to go there, but regardless it seems that original goal he was able to get it somehow into this story which ok I will not spoil the ending at all but I will say it made me cry a lot more than Clannad and hence it's the reason why people say Tomoyo After is more sadder than Clannad. Anyway so to end this how does this to me hold up compared to Clannad? Is it better than Clannad? Is it not? To me I believe this is great on it's own and it's up there with Clannad.I give Key so much applause to making this story that isn't even canon but still makes a great story involving a very interesting character (their favorite too btw true story Jun wanted to make this cause he loves Tomoyo lol). I gave Clannad a 10/10 and I didn't say this for my Side Stories review but I give that maybe a 8/10 but as for Tomoyo After It's a Wonderful Life, I give this a 9/10. It's a very good visual novel I highly recommend it and I urge to those who are interested in all three of these vns please do get the bundle it'll be worth it. Just one last thing to send this off: remember do not give up on finding your treasure, your meaning of life. The path can be rough but know you're not alone in this and someday you will find it.

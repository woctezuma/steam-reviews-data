And this is a shame:  I think this game is fantastic, with very few flaws I can think of.  Though, others may spot certain flaws in places where there arent any for me, and they could be deal-breakers... we'll get to that later.\n\nThis is effectively a board game, where the \"board\" is built up and expanded during the game by exploring and revealing new sectors (cards), and playing cards from your hand (which are played on top of already revealed cards, not on blank spaces).  You have colonists, which are your pieces that you move around the board to accomplish various tasks, and assorted resources that need managing.  Due to the random nature of the board and the cards you draw, each game can be very different from the last.  All of this provides a very solid, if not particularly unique, base that the game as a whole then builds upon.  \n\nYour goal in each playthrough is simple:  Settle a certain number of colonists within a limited number of turns.  You'll start each game with exactly three colonists, a homeworld (which is a unique card type that cannot appear elsewhere), and the four cards adjacent to it revealed.  The overall board's basic shape is the same every time, as is the placement of sectors that require military strength to reveal.  These are the only things that are the same from one game to the next... everything else will depend on the luck of the draw, and more importantly, your ability to react and adapt to what happens as new cards are drawn and revealed.\n\nThis is a game that's about strategy, decision making, and planning, and much of this revolves around the resources that you'll use for everything.  You have oxygen, needed to keep your guys from being dead, hydrogen that you spend to move those guys around the board, metal that is spent to build stuff, and military strength, a special resource that is not spent when used but is much harder to get than the others.  And lastly, you have habitats, which are where your colonists can settle.  These resources and their functions are very easy to understand, and as there arent that many types, it makes it nice and easy to keep track of what's going on.  Which is good, because these resources are the key to absolutely everything.  The gameplay as a whole revolves entirely around using and managing these resources to get to a point of having both enough habitats and also producing enough colonists to then settle in those habitats and win the game, before you run out of turns.\n\nNaturally, you'll use the cards themselves to get things done.  One great thing about the game is that the cards are very easy to understand at a glance, yet stuffed full of depth and potential.  Most cards will have one or two abilities that can be activated to do something.  This could be something like simply gaining some resources or cards, trading one resource for another, gaining another colonist, or various other effects.  And these are easy to read, as unlike many card-based games, these cards arent covered in blobs of text.  Simple symbols are used to show what they do.  When text does come into play for cards with more complex functions, it's kept very short, concise, and easy to understand.  This is good, because you'll have a heck of alot of cards on the board, and you need to be able to have a good grasp of the situation in order to know where to send your colonists.  Card abilities are activated by having the required number of colonists on them, yet each colonist activates the ability seperately.  So if you have an ability that requires two of them standing on it, you can have each of the two activate it seperately.  Using an ability requiring less colonists however cannot be used if a higher ability is available, which means that the specific timing you use can be very important, and is one of the harder aspects of the game to get used to.   There are many different cards, and many times the difference between two cards may appear subtle at first glance, but you'll quickly learn that these differences can actually be pretty huge.   Which means that you have to carefully think over where and when to place cards from your hand, because using them at the wrong time in the wrong spots could spell your doom.\n\nNot that the game will eat your face right away though.  Aside from the excellent tutorial, the game does a great job of easing you into the gameplay via it's rank system.  As you get better and win more rounds, your rank will increase, and it will get progressively harder, requiring you to learn new strategies and go further into the depth of the game's mechanics in order to win.  If you are having too much trouble at a certain rank, it will start to lower, keeping the game's challenge at a point that keeps things interesting and tough while not being overwhelming, increasing as you gain skill and knowledge.  In addition, as you go you will unlock new races to play as, which have unique mechanics and aspects that apply to them.  Unlocking the Formids for example brings the concept of stacking into play, which is the act of putting multiple cards on the same space.  Plenty of cards will revolve around how high of a stack a given space has.  This creates a very different sort of challenge, as while you can stack cards while playing as the humans, it's not at all important.  But with the Formids, it becomes a focus.\n\nSo, lots of depth and challenge going on here.  However, some things may be a bit of a turnoff.  The very limited graphics, for instance, or the near total lack of any sort of story or lore.  Or the fact that the game isnt hugely unique.  If you play board games, you've probably seen many other similar games out there.  The whole \"build the board as you go and deal with random lunacy\" type game is pretty popular, after all. So, while well executed, if you're looking for something truly new and unique, you may not find what you want here.  These things could easily be deal-breakers for some, and need to be considered before making a purchase.  The game just isnt going to work for everyone.  Not to mention that the fact that the game eases you into things slowly is sort of a double-edged sword: early playthroughs, at low ranks, can make things seem a bit too simple, and can make it look like the same basic strategy is going to work every single time.  This is a game that requires some time spent before you're going to see what it can really bring to the table, and that can be a bit of a problem.  It's something that I've had trouble with in other games myself as well.  I'm a few hours in, and while there's plenty going on, I still feel like I've only scratched the surface and have much more to learn.  Which is fine, but again, that may give the wrong impression due to the time it takes for the game to truly reveal it's depth and challenge.\n\nIf the game turns out to be a good fit for you, there's alot to love here.  The increasing challenge and complexity, the RNG aspect, the unlocks, and even the short game length make for a massive amount of replayability here, and lots of enjoyment.  And the potential for more content down the line.  Not to mention the game being very, very good at easing you into things while still being capable of providing incredible difficulty and requiring alot of careful thinking and strategizing once you reach a point where it gets tough for you.  It isnt for everyone, but for me at least, it's just the sort of thing I love.

You have three people and as you move squares (using energy) you reveal new locations.  The locations allow you to produce resources (different production depending on whether one or two people are standing on the space).  Each person uses an oxygen and so on your first turn you need to ensure you have found an oxygen generating planet and an energy generating planet.\nAdditionally you have cards in your hand (max 7) which are planets you can build on existing locations, or scrapping the card for a resource.  Squares near the edges need a particular amount of military power to explore (from cards that have military power on them).\nWhen you play humans enough times you unlock the next of 3 other races which have somewhat different dynamics.  Also playing games gives you XP which allows you to unlock additional cards.\n\nOverall a fun game.  I was worried from the description of rank system that I would hit a wall after a few games, but humans are pretty easy to play and I've racked up a good number of hours already.  Each rank reduces the turns you have to win, and increases the number of settled people needed to win.  Looking at the other reviews I can see a reasonable number of hours played despite it being a new game.\n\nMy two small grumbles are:\n- Card graphics could be better.  Its good that they are clear and simple, but perhaps they could have a touch of card texture and rounded edges to look a bit more like real cards.  Or perhaps build this into the options for us to have a choice of looks?\n- As you play you progress in two ways - unlocked cards and unlocked new races.  This is good and gives a lot of hours gameplay - however I would have liked a third progress area which is the ability to spend XP on upgrading the cards to higher levels (give slightly more resource from upgrades, or cost slightly less etc.).  I like the feeling of 'working for rewards' and having a choice of spending my XP on card upgrades / new cards / race unlocks would make me feel my time spend on earning XP was more valuable - plus make the game last much longer.\n\nOverall very happy with my purchase - great blend of relaxing strategy with enough random chance that I won't beat myself up when I lose (although I haven't yet lost a game so far).", "timestamp_created": 1500828752, "timestamp_updated": 1500828752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33745428": {"recommendationid": "33745428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037222425", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512247823}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow!

The catch being it costs resources just to move and maintain them, and if you settle a colonist, they're then out of action (kind of like dying for points).\n\nAnother big factor in your success is maximizing the use of your hand of cards by strategically upgrading the various worlds you've uncovered.  These cards will usually have some restriction as to where they can be placed and often a cost in resources to create.

I was one of the first to buy the game and I had some issues (on the Linux version). He immediately listened and tried to figure it out. He already told me some fixes are on the way. And I trust they are because he still fixes stuff in his older games even though he will probably not earn much more money from them (I guess, I really don't know how well these games sell and I certainly advice you to look at his other games).

Move your space explorers around an unknown galaxy, collect cards and increasing your population and production, build up enough habitats, and settle enough people before the game ends in the sixth round.  Succeed, and your rank goes up.  Fail, and all your colonists perish in the abyss of space.  More importantly, your rank goes down.\n\nFrom a very straightforward rule set emerges a very complicated strategic game.  Population increases production and allows expansion, so you want to grow your population.  But do you prioritize that over exploring the more profitable corners of the map, or over drawing cards to find a high production upgrade to your planets?  The cards add even more variety to your gameplay.  Each card can be discarded for a resource instead of being played, so even if you get a building you don\u2019t need, you can make use of the card.  Some cards have benefits based on map location, so placement on the map matters too.  Others synergize really well, so if you draw two such cards you might end up altering your entire game plan to take advantage of it.  \n\nA characteristic of this game (and all previous BGG games) is that a ranking system gradually increases the difficulty to match your skill level.  There will always be a new challenge awaiting you.  Solar Settlers takes it even a step further.  The game has 5 races, each with their own starting planet(s) and unique bonus.  Each race and starting planet plays very differently, to the point where some cards that you might consider essential for one race will get discarded for another.  Even your general strategy for exploration/population growth/settlement is strongly affected by race.\n\nAnother perk is the response time of the dev.  Though I cannot confirm this, I feel certain that if his house was being broken into, he would finish adding that feature you requested before calling 911.  So you know the game you buy today will be improved a week later, improved again a month later, and so on.  \n\nIf this is your first BGG game, I am truly envious of you.  You can go through the whole catalog and experience for the first time all the other awesome BGG games.  If you\u2019re already familiar with his past games, you probably just bought this without reading the reviews.  That\u2019s what I did.\n", "timestamp_created": 1500653308, "timestamp_updated": 1500653308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559682", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33699740": {"recommendationid": "33699740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036404809", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501867594}, "language": "english", "review": "Solar Settlers is a refreshing new direction from BrainGoodGames earlier games like Militia and Minos Strategos. They retain the same \"cards on a grid\" play structure but, with the addition of settlers and resource management, strike the balance between casual fun and strategic gameplay. Solar Settlers is all about bringing your crew of colonists to a new system in space and making the system viable for human habitation within 12 turns or less. There is no timer except the impending 12th Round.\n\nSolar Settlers has a terrific and encompassing tutorial which does what all tutorials should do: give you the basics of gameplay without overwhelming you or boring you to death. Each turn is made up of movement on the grid, limited by the amount of fuel you expend moving between spaces on the grid, using abilities stated on the cards in play, and settling colonists. You have to manage oxygen usage every turn as well. If you have more colonists on the grid than oxygen reserves, the extra will suffocate. Not very helpful when you are trying to colonize space.\n\nThis game is casual fun. While I found that BrainGoodGames previous installments lacked anything to keep me playing long-term, the variations within each system and the unpredictability of the game mean that this has very high replayability.\n\nPick up Solar Settlers, you won't be disappointed. Just make sure you have enough oxygen to continue your gameplay sessions.\n\nPros:\n+Easy to Learn\n+Educational\n+Great, minimalist UI\n+High Replayability\n\nCons:\n-NONE!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PXdykAmmOJM", "timestamp_created": 1500652878, "timestamp_updated": 1500652878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476011", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 63, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 64}}

Sound design follows suit with catchy music, striking sound effects, and voice samples that lend this title an extra bit of arcadey flair.\n\nI was also pleased at the extra care put into balancing the difficulty of this game over Bot Vice; while the former title clearly expects players to perch squarely on the edge of their seats through each teeth-grittingly chaotic stage, Strikey Sisters takes a much more leisurely approach. Enemies attack less frequently, bullets move more slowly, and in general the hazards present in stages are much easier to identify as the screen is much less crowded thanks to the increased play area. That isn't to say that Strikey Sisters isn't still a challenge; you still have limited chances to clear a stage, and once you run out of lives you'll need to restart from scratch.\n\nStill, Strikey Sisters does an excellent job of addressing the inherently random nature of clearing blocks by giving the player more direct control over directing the ball, providing a variety of powerups that are useful in both attacking enemies, defending against bullets, and clearing blocks off the playfield. When used correctly this greatly cuts down on the amount of down time the player has waiting for the ball to return.\n\nDYA Games even manages to fit in some extra replay value in the form of Gems and the Bestiary; in each stage there is one Gem to collect, and throughout the stages you can pick up the Card spell which allows you to \"capture\" an enemy to add it to your collection percentage. While it doesn't do much to extend the gamplay for someone simply looking to finish all the stages, anyone who deems themselves a completionist will appreciate the gesture.\n\nIf you appreciate arcade-style games with tight controls and top-tier production value I would definitely recommend checking this out, especially for the price.", "timestamp_created": 1515967969, "timestamp_updated": 1515967969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39350667": {"recommendationid": "39350667", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095924054", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 109, "playtime_forever": 367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 367, "last_played": 1515966921}, "language": "english", "review": "A simple fun arcade game.

The soundtrack really makes it feel like a long lost PC Engine CD game, it feels retro without going the obvious chiptune route.  The story is pretty amusing with some good voice acting barring one of the main sisters who is just kind of grating. You can turn off the cut scene voices but unfortunately not the in-game ones which is a shame as the bosses voices are incredibly repetitive.\n\nThe bosses are a pain in the backside simply because they have too many hit poinys, can only be hit from the back and constantly move (sometimes dodging and teleporting) making it very time consuming and almost pure luck to hit them with the ball. \n\nI also wish the game was clear about how you unlock some hidden levels as it doesn't explain that you have to grab enough coins in some levels for a blue chest to appear with a key inside. Comparing mymap to a complete map on the Steam coummnity was the only way I could tell where these hidden levels were: there needs to be a padlock or something to give you a hint where to go to get keys.\n\nAll in all a bit flawed in spots but for how cheap it is it's definitely one of the better breakout genre games on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1514720365, "timestamp_updated": 1514720365,

However, for being that, it still manages to build on top of that and be a pretty fun romp. Graphically, it gives me a lot of iREM vibes, and the music is pretty cute for the tone the game is going for.

Qu'elle bon jeu, surtout quand celui ci as etait represent\u00e9 de toutes les manieres a toutes les sauces et sous toutes les formes et ce depuis longtemps deja. Mais revenons a notre sujet ...\n\nComme dit plus haut celui ci est un arkanoid like avec un gameplay pas tres originale et des graphismes assez basique pour le coup et comme tout les jeux du genre. Mais celui ci presente toutefois un charme qui n'est pas negligeable. \n\nVous controlez deux soeurs au choix, qui se doivent de reussir une mission quelconque et le encore rien d'originale, mais ce qui rend le jeu interessant, c'est deja que cest un arkanoid mais aussi que le jeu est tres mignons  et les couleurs bien choisis. Sortileges, coup charger et speciaux, accessoires vous seront utiles de meme qu'amasser les differents tresors des differents niveaux que proposes le jeu pour les succ\u00e9s mais aussi atteindre les 100%. \n\nLe jeu est difficile et souvent punitif si vous n'avez pas assez de reflexe et de concentration voir rageant a pas mal de moment. \"Die and retry\" si je puis me permettre ses termes ou \"meurs et recommence\" en bon FR. \nMais meme si la difficult\u00e9 est elev\u00e9 et le jeu resistant aux assaults repet\u00e9s ! \nRien n'est meilleurs que le moment ou vous mettez le dernier coup de balle dans la derniere pierre ou le dernier monstre qui vous barre le chemin du succ\u00e9s !!! \n\nEnfin tres bon petit jeu qui vaut toutefois bien son prix, amusant de temps a autres, redondant certe mais attachant quand aussi. Y'as quand meme un travail sur ce jeu et rien est laiss\u00e9 au hazard. \n\nDonc bon defouloir, a recommand\u00e9 aux fans du genre meurs et reviens demain ou aux petits curieux qui cherche des jeux pas forcement cher et qui veulent s'amuser et bien sur aux fans du genre arkanoid.\n\nPour ma part je m'amuse bien de temps a autres donc je le recommande. \n\nMerci de me lire et  bon jeu.\n", "timestamp_created": 1513013518, "timestamp_updated": 1513013518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38208915": {"recommendationid": "38208915", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143107094", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 935, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513222503}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u96be\u4ee5\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6e38\u620f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u628a\u5f53\u5e74\u5728\u9ed1\u767d\u5c4f\u4e0a\u73a9\u7684\u6253\u7816\u5757\u8fdb\u5316\u6210\u4e86\u73b0\u5728\u7684\u6837\u5b50\uff0c\u6709\u70b9\u627e\u56de\u5f53\u5e74\u5728\u8857\u673a\u5385\u73a9\u70b8\u5f39\u4eba\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u4e86\uff0c\u5f88\u53ef\u60dc\u4e0d\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u6211\u7684\u8857\u673a\u6447\u6746\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u8857\u673a\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u7c7b\u6253\u7816\u5757\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u5206\u4e3a\u666e\u901a\u5173\u5361\u548cBoss\u6218\u5173\u5361\u3002\u666e\u901a\u5173\u5361\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u6253\u7816\u5757\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u6e05\u7406\u6389\u573a\u4e0a\u6240\u6709\u7816\u5757\u624d\u80fd\u8fc7\u5173\uff0c\u5f53\u7136\u5728\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u91cc\u8fd8\u5f97\u6e05\u7406\u5b8c\u573a\u4e0a\u7684\u602a\u7269\u3002\u800cBoss\u6218\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u51fb\u8d25Boss\u5934\u76ee\u5c31\u884c\u4e86\uff0c\u987a\u4fbf\u503c\u7684\u4e00\u63d0\u662fBoss\u6218\u524d\u7684\u8fc7\u573a\u52a8\u753b\u8fd8\u86ee\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u786c\u8981\u8bf4\u7f3a\u70b9\u7684\u8bdd\u90a3\u5c31\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4f60\u53d1\u884c\u5f97\u592a\u665a\u5566\uff01\u4f60\u8981\u65e9\u4e00\u4e24\u5e74\u53d1\u884c\u7684\u8bdd\u6211\u5728\u5927\u5b66\u5bbf\u820d\u548c\u5ba4\u53cb\u4ee5\u53ca\u597d\u57fa\u53cb\u5565\u7684\u53c8\u591a\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u5a31\u4e50\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u65f6\u95f4\u6570\u4e0a\u767e\u5c0f\u65f6\u59a5\u59a5\u7684\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u4f60\u8ba9\u6211\u627e\u4eba\u548c\u6211\u4e00\u8d77\u73a9\u8fd8\u771f\u662f\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u6709\u7238\u5988\u5427\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u6e38\u620f\u6709\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u6709\u4e2a\u59d0\u5427\uff0c\u5979\u53c8\u4e0d\u600e\u4e48\u73a9\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6709\u4e2a\u59b9\u5427\uff0c\u5979\u53c8\u8ddd\u79bb\u6211\u592a\u8fdc\u5566\uff01\u5509\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u5bc4\u5e0c\u671b\u4e8e\u4ee5\u540e\u6709\u4e86\u59bb\u5b50\u548c\u5b69\u5b50\u540c\u5979\u4eec\u4e00\u8d77\u73a9\u800d\u4e86\u3002\u603b\u4e4b\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u5341\u5206\u5408\u6211\u7684\u80c3\u53e3\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4eba\u73a9\u7684\u8bdd\u5e94\u8be5\u4f1a\u5f88\u6709\u8da3\u5427\uff0c\u563f\u563f\u563f\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1512909345, "timestamp_updated": 1512909345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38205951": {"recommendationid": "38205951", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978456381", "num_games_owned": 430, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512900773}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing brick brock game with RPG elements !\nYou can either play alone or with a teammate.\n\nYour goal is to destroy every block and then kill the remaining ennemies to finish a level.\nEvery block you destroy gives you a gold coin you can pick up.\nEvery ennemy killed gives you a powerful bonus item.\nWhen having 50% of total coins, a green chest appears : it contains a green card which can be thrown to an ennemy to add it to the bestiary.\nAt 60% total coins, you get a brown chest containing a green emeraude -

When I started up the game, it brought me into that memory of my youth when played those many arcade games back in the days, which they where all great times for me.  This game from DYA Games, has given me so much motivation to go and create a full cabinet arcade system to have at home.\n\nStrikey Sisters brings many other game element styles into the mix.  You got the map to choose which levels areas you want to start off from. just like Super Mario Brothers 3.  With the gameplay style of Brick Breaker arcade gameplay, which i was very impress that this game was that kind of gameplay, but with action style in the mix.  It also give that pixel arcade style feel and look.  That fans of retro games, will surely enjoy, with good sound effects and good music too.\n\nThe game is also a local two player co-op, which you and friend can play as ether one of the two sisters.  Marie and Elene.  Which they both do the same attack style when you press the attack button.  But they do not look or sound the same.  The story of the game, is very interesting and funny.  All character designs and look, just give you those old time nostlagia feel when playing a game back in the days on the consoles like nintendo & sega genesis system.\n\nArt design of the game is so right on with the pixel graphic look, of those retro games back in the days.  As i mention before anyone enjoy the retro games of times past before, will feel right at home with this game.  The game also as many other features, such as changing the difficult from easy to hard and etc.  \n\nNow to the pros and cons\n\nPros+\n\n+Good Story\n\n+Amainzg Pixel Art Style\n\n+Good Soundtrack & Sound Effects\n\n+Great Fun Gameplay\n\n+Hours of play\n\n+Local 2 Player Co-op\n\nCons-\n\n-Nothing to complain\n\nSo this is my review of the Strikey Sisters.  Would i recommend this game to a family or friend?  Yes i would, is it worth the full price?  Yes it is, but if you are still unsure if paying full price is worth it.  Then wait for a sale but in honest truth, it not that pricey which wouldn't break your wallet or purse at all.\n\nHope this helps anyone that has been wondering if the game is worth it or not.", "timestamp_created": 1511854866, "timestamp_updated": 1511854866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37786043": {"recommendationid": "37786043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103905655", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511116338}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "Um jogo em tudo muito semelhante ao velhinho e cl\u00e1ssico estilo de arkanoid!\nGrau de dificuldade aceit\u00e1vel, jogava algumas fases algumas vezes, o que me dava mais vontade de rebentar com os \"monstrinhos\".\nA hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 simples e com um final que n\u00e3o estava nada \u00e0 espera.

Really enjoying it now. \n\nAll the ingredients for a solid game are here, but unfortunately I'm finding it a little frustrating. The stages are too small vertically. You play very close to the blocks, which means it's easy to toss the ball behind you accidentally, and the unbreakable blocks tend to be annoyingly in the way too often. I would also argue that you move too slow. Especially if you consider getting all the coins. Each block drops a coin down to you when broken, and each level shows you how many coins you've collected in it. Getting all of them in one stage is frustrating and takes a lot away from the fun of the game, because using power ups can cause blocks to break all over the place and you'll never be able to get all of them at once, not to mention the need to catch the ball. Getting 100% completion would be a nightmare.\n\nAesthetically this game is fantastic. Looks, sounds and feels like a 16-bit arcade classic. I would guess that the game was inspired by the SNES game Firestriker, because it's sort of a beefed up version of that, although not so much in terms of gameplay. I was actually really hoping it would be more like Firestriker, because that game did this sort of thing incredibly well, in my opinion. But the premise here is still good.

It plays like a more complicated and engaging version of Atari Breakout. It has most of the pros and cons of a brick breaker, meaning that I'd recommmend it to people who already enjoy the genre.\n\nPros:\n - Quick-paced and keeps you on your toes with enemies and lots of collectibles\n - Great amount of enemy variety and powerups that all do different things\n - AWESOME graphical style\n - Difficulty options\n - Lots of levels to play through\n - Good sense of accomplishment after beating every level\n\nCons:\n - Though it is unavoidable in the genre, the endgame of each level can last for a long time. The game does compensate for this with some of its powerups.\n - There is no real acknowledgement for finishing levels/collecting things on a higher difficulty. Some people might be incentivized to play on the easiest mode the whole time (which I wouldn't imagine to be too much easier, because I'd think it would make levels take longer+there would be less powerups; probably mroe of a \"beginner\" mode). The normal difficulty is recommended, and it is is what I'm going to play with the whole time, but it would be nice to have some sort of incentive to play on the higher difficulty.\n\nIt's still a lot more fun than most games, and it's worth the price.", "timestamp_created": 1503276990, "timestamp_updated": 1503596179, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34378541": {"recommendationid": "34378541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304216232", "num_games_owned": 774, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503293520}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0417\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0435\u0441\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043b 70% \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b. \u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0443\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e! \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0445 (\u0438\u0445 \u0436\u0435 3, \u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e?) \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u043f\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435, \u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043e \u0437\u0432\u0443\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u041d\u0435\u0447\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0435, \u043b\u0430\u043c\u043f\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435, \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 SEGA)\nAddictive gameplay, Fast and bright!", "timestamp_created": 1503250269, "timestamp_updated": 1503250269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34359291": {"recommendationid": "34359291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011794200", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503181533}, "language": "english", "review": "Hello, after beating this game (with all achievement) and I read I will review if I like this game. \nOf course, I will review, because I love this game.\n\nThis game has a style of Arkanoid but there lot stuff to do, like a catch all \" Pokemon \", scout all maps, get all gems, etc... this very long to beat games, now I will talk about [i]Pros[/i] and [i]cons[/i]:\n\n[i]Pros[/i]:\n\n[b]Story[/b] - The story is understandable and is easy to read that what happens about this game is not confused.\n\n[b]Art[/b] - The pixels and arts are so beautiful is a reminder from Snes 90s but is very nice. Is cute to watch.\n\n[b]Characters[/b] - Those characters, bosses, and an enemy are pretty cute, voice acting is nice when they talking some a  funnies, angry, etc.... sometimes I laugh.\n\n[b]Soundtrack and sound[/b] - The sound look good and the song pretty awesome, there no hate all list, the guy who did the song from this game call Dominic Ninmark, should check him in Bandcamp, those songs are very good.\n\n[b]Control[/b] - the control is 100% flow there no problem\n\n[i]Cons[/i]:\n\nI dont know is bug or not.\nSome bosses sometimes they will go very near you, if you kill him by sword or ball, he die but if you try to pass him you get hit and die and the game will start again. The good example that Boss of cat (Nabel) she will jump on you if you made hit her same time, she down and you just happy because you defeat her but if you try to pass her you die and restart again.\nCan you if you defeat those bosses that characters should be invincible (this happen me 4 time)\n\nIs this game worth in your library?\nYes this game is Arkanoid, style art Snes 90s, lot stuff and is very good 9/10\n\nI hope DYA Games get famous and popular, all your games is awesome.\n\nMy English is not good but I trying to write lol\n\nGo guys PLAY THIS GAME\n\n", "timestamp_created":

now i will say this, no i didn\u2019t play this game to completion but i did play at least an hour and that normally would be enough to give em a good idea of how much i would like it. \n\nThings I Liked: I LOVE the way DYA games does pixel art and the music is absolutely great as well, the cheesy voice acting is always great and yes, i did love the character designs within the game and lastly the simple story is always great.\n\nThings I Didn\u2019t Like: The Game Is SO SLOW! if is in fact an arkanoid like block breaking game at heart but the difference is that arkanoid has progressively increasing ball speed, power-ups that are fun and useful and a great game feel. this game has half of one of these, the power-ups are kind of fun but they aren\u2019t really that useful, the ball keeps it's slow pace and there is even a power-up that slows the ball down even more and the enemies are not intimidating or even a challenge what so ever, and lastly my biggest issue is the character game feel, the characters just aren\u2019t very fun to move around and they feel like they just feel like they are moving around in jelly.\n\ni feel that if this game had maybe a little more depth to it and some more challenging enemies along with some sort of dynamic way of moving along with a quicker ball and a few more power-ups this could have been way better.\n\nlike i said, i really wanted to like this game i really did but i just couldn't and hey, this game has 40 positive reviews so that must mean that some people could find something to love that i just couldn't",

DYA games tends to make very fun pixel games with an arcade feel and Strikey Sisters is no different. It has a nice, upbeat soundtrack, fun additions to the breakout gameplay with the spells and abilities added in, collectibles galore, and some truly interesting boss battles.  I also give the game credit for having full voice acting.  It is hit and miss in places, going at times too shrill anime, but...credit for trying, some of it is pretty fun.\n\nNow, the mixed bag part.  This is a breakout game through and through, which means it has all the frustrations of hitting a ball over and over again to try and kill the last enemy hiding in a corner or the last block hidden in a corner.  That is incredibly lame.  Also, while the abilities and additions are nice, there aren't enough evolutions to remove the frustration.  Likewise, it's annoying that some enemies can just hit the ball away or hide with their back to the wall to prevent you from advancing.  Finally, you can get multiple of the less fun upgrades, of which only about half are really enjoyable.  Also, despite having collectibles, aside from the bestiary, you can't tell how many emeralds you've got, keys, or whatever from each stage.  All you get is an arbitrary percentage marker.\n\nSo, frustrations aside, do I recommend?  Well, yeah.  It's oozing with charm and if you like Breakout, you can do much worse.  Frankly, I like the arcade gameplay better than Wizorb or other Breakout contemporaries.

Such a fun game with lots of charm. \u2665", "timestamp_created": 1499429671, "timestamp_updated": 1499429671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516044", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33303793": {"recommendationid": "33303793", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973982160", "num_games_owned": 571, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497937934}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you like breakout?  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1499327446, "timestamp_updated": 1499327446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438050", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33152416": {"recommendationid": "33152416", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966750641", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499027734}, "language": "english", "review": "Note: I've only played this game Co-op\n\nPro: This game does a great job of adding some intensity to the classic breakout formula. It's challenging, but after a little while you understand the flow of the game and the game works very well once you do. There's a lot of variation in both regular enemies and bosses. The art looks excellent.\n\nCon: I personally wasn't a fan of the cutscenes, but they're completely optional. So if that's not your thing, it doesn't get in the way of the action.\n\nStats:\nGame Length: A few hours.

at it's core, a simple brick breaking arcade game. But the package it's wrapped in as well as lots of neat little features make it something special.\n\nThe story is simple, retro video game faire. Two witch sisters lose their beloved pet and go about beating up monsters all over a fantasy kingdom to find him. It's very goofy and doesn't take itself seriously at all, which is just fine. Reminds you of something you would see in a 90's game.\n\nThe dialogue is fully voiced over to mixed results. The two sisters, as well as many of the characters, are enjoyable but many of them deliver lines with unusual pronunciation or tone. One jarring case is when a character's name is pronounced completely differently by two different characters. Another is when an actor's dialogue is clearly supposed to be interrupted but they finished their line as a complete sentence. I also learned that one actor played all the male characters. While that's a neat credit to have and some of his performances are fine, several are also weak and I think he was stretched too thin. \n\nAt the end of the day, the gameplay is what matters and that's where Strikey Sisters shines! You move back and forth to knock a ball up and break blocks like many classic arcade games. What makes this stand out is you play in an arena full of monsters that hamper your progress. Some are simply obstacles while others attack you in interesting ways. Killing these monsters give you a variety of power ups that either enhance your ball, yourself, or affect monsters in some way. Bosses also keep things fresh and are often invincible from the front, so you must get creative in how you'll defeat them.\n\nThe simplest little feature that makes all the difference is your attack button. This one button allows you greater control of your ball's trajectory than most brick breakers. Not only that, you can use it to attack enemies close by. Not only that, you can use it to block enemy attacks. Not only THAT, you can charge your attack to hit your ball with greater force that breaks blocks and kill enemies faster. NOT ONLY THAT, your charged attack can deflect enemy projectiles. which is incredibly helpful for taking down bosses! It's a beautiful example of simple innovation. I love it when games can make one little feature very robust and useful. I think of the jump button in Downwell. \n\nBeing that the gameplay is very simple, I find it a good thing that the game isn't overly long. I beat it (not 100%) in about 5 hours, and there's still unlockable levels and a bestiary to complete! I often found myself meaning to only sit down for a level or two, then found myself totally sucked in. I also found the difficulty to be fair and steadily increases throughout the story. \n\nThe entire game has a beautiful, pixelated esthetic and is supported by catchy synth tunes! There aren't a ton of tracks but enough for the map, cutscenes, levels and boss fights and they get the job done! The entire game gave me a lot of nostalgic, warm fuzzy feelings! \n\nOverall, I highly enjoyed Strikey Sisters throughout. While I do have some production qualms, the game does exactly what it sets out to do beautifully. Credit also has to go out to the two brothers who made it. You guys created an excellent product that you both should be very proud of and you're officially on my radar now. This game is incredibly solid and, if you take everything you learn from the feedback, your next game should be fantastic.

Now it's here, and while I think that Bot Vice is still the better game of the two, Strikey Sisters is worth checking out for anyone who's interested in retro action!\n\nStrikey Sisters is a pretty fun game that could be seen as a mix of action games and classic brick breaker style games.\nYour characters are stuck at the bottom of the playing field (can only move left and right), and your job is to destroy all bricks and monsters by using the ball that bounces around. You'll also find several power-ups and attack spells to help you. If the enemies get close enough, you can still also melee attack them. Just like in classic brick breaking games, you are not allowed to let the ball go off screen, you will lose health if you do, so you'll need to be careful to not let that happen.\n\n+ Fun gameplay\n+ Good pixel art\n+ Good music\n+ Two player co-op\n+ Funny story and dialog that doesn't take itself too seriously. Cutscenes also have voice acting. It is not always that great, but at least the main characters' voice actresses did a very good job. I'm actually really glad that the devs decided to have voice acting both in this game and Bot Vice, because it just gives the game so much personality!\n+ Generally it's a polished game, just what I would expect from DYA games!\n\n- Can get repeative after playing a while\n- There can be moments when the ball is bouncing around in the back of the stage for a long times before it comes back to you, and meanwhile you don't really have much to do. It can also get frustrating when there is one unbroken brick left at some tricky location and you keep hitting the ball for a long time until you finally get it broken", "timestamp_created": 1497536251, "timestamp_updated": 1500117210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32392016": {"recommendationid": "32392016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038008642", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498583925}, "language": "german", "review": "Strikey Sisters ist ein sehr spa\u00dfiges arcade brick-breaker game.\nMan steuert eine von den beiden protagonistinnen die auf der Suche nach Ihrem vermissten Haustier sind.\nMan bewegt seinen Charakter traditionell nach links und rechts wobei man anstatt den ball abbrallen zu lassen, man nach diesem mit einer Art Stab danach schl\u00e4gt (was einem mehr Kontrolle \u00fcber die ballrichtung gibt).\nDazu kommt das besiegte Gegner Power Ups (Spells) fallen lassen die dann Gewinn bringend eingesetzt werden k\u00f6nnen.\n\nMir macht das Spiel auf jedenfall Spa\u00df auch wenn ich es noch nicht durch habe.\nDas Einzige was evtl. etwas abschreckend f\u00fcr einige sein k\u00f6nnte ist der Preis, aber da mus jeder selbst wissen ob es Ihm das wert ist ansonsten warten auf einen Sale.", "timestamp_created": 1497369831, "timestamp_updated": 1497369831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514098", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32375930": {"recommendationid": "32375930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002170172", "num_games_owned": 848, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499123766}, "language": "german", "review": "Da mir dieses kleine Game sehr viel Spa\u00df gemacht hat m\u00f6chte ich gerne ein positives Feedback hier lassen.\n\nEs ist ein solides Brickbreaker-Style-Game in Pixelart-Grafik.

En aquel momento estaban a punto de lanzar su segundo juego para Steam, [b][i]Bot Vice[/i][/b], y me lanc\u00e9 sin pensarlo a por \u00e9l. Lo que me encontr\u00e9 fue un juego que desped\u00eda olor a sal\u00f3n arcade por todos sus poros, y eso es algo que resuena muy fuerte en mi interior porque viv\u00ed plenamente aquella \u00e9poca a mediados de los '80 y hasta su casi total desaparici\u00f3n en los '90. As\u00ed que [b][i]Bot Vice[/i][/b] me hizo confiar ciegamente en el buen hacer de DYA, y cuando anunciaron [b][i]Strikey Sisters[/i][/b] lo apoy\u00e9 desde el primer momento. No me han decepcionado en absoluto.\n\nUna semana despu\u00e9s de comprar el juego ya me lo hab\u00eda pasado al 100%, y disfrut\u00e9 cada segundo. Me gustan mucho los machacaladrillos, y [b][i]Strikey Sisters[/i][/b] es el mejor que ha llegado a Steam desde [i]Wizorb[/i]. La ventaja frente al juego de Tribute Games est\u00e1 en una mayor accesibilidad e inmediatez: puedes ir fase a fase en un mundo abierto en el que nadie te dice cu\u00e1l es el orden que debes seguir. Mientras hayas desbloqueado un nivel, puedes jugarlo, y si una fase se te resiste, puedes seguir jugando por otro camino. As\u00ed que nada de tener que superar una docena de fases y un [i]final boss[/i] del tir\u00f3n. [b][i]Strikey Sisters[/i][/b] se presta a sesiones de juego cortas, como un buen arcade, y hay suficiente variedad en escenarios, enemigos, y jefes como para no aburrirse nunca al estar viendo siempre lo mismo. La mec\u00e1nica de juego es sencilla y muy bien ajustada, y da lugar a momentos espectaculares gracias a la mezcla de ataques fuertes, hechizos, e \u00edtems potenciadores. Adem\u00e1s hay mucho que hacer aparte de superar todas las fases, como hacerse con la gema verde de cada nivel, descubrir todos los niveles secretos, o capturar todos los tipos de enemigo para completar el bestiario. Por supuesto, siendo obra de DYA Games, todo el apartado audiovisual es una delicia, desde los efectos sonoros que son puro arcade hasta los gr\u00e1ficos con cierto aire a juego de Super Nintendo.\n\nSi te gustan los buenos arcades y los juegos mimados en cada uno de sus aspectos, no puedes dejar pasar [b][i]Strikey Sisters[/i][/b], una sobresaliente experiencia retro que te atrapar\u00e1 hasta su conclusi\u00f3n.

It will break bricks faster and reflect projectiles. Enemies will drop power ups and respawn until every brick has been destroyed. Power ups will come pouring down the screen, ranging from freezing enemies, lighting attacks, fire balls, bombs, and more. Not only will you need to collect power ups, but bricks will also drop coins which are needed to unlock treasure chests containing keys for secret levels and a monster catching ability. There is a cutscene and boss battle every 4 stages which are even more frantic and fun. Don't worry, missing your ball or getting hit 3 times only makes you restart the stage.

I found Bot Vice a bit more difficult too.\n\nThis one is a breakout/arkanoid style game where you smack a ball back and forth to destroy blocks while also fighting enemies and dodging their attacks. The goal in regular stages is to destroy all the blocks and then the remaining enemies who will keep respawning, trying to kill you, so long as there are still blocks on screen. You actually hit the ball with a slashing attack so you can control its direction if you hit it at certain angles. You can also charge your slash to hit the ball faster and also use it to reflect most enemy attacks which is very usefull. \n\nThen there's a boss battle every so often where you only have to diminish the boss's health bar instead of destroying every block. Boss battles are alot of fun and can be a bit intense IMO. Some of them I had to retry quite a few times. lol.\n\nIt has a light-hearted story with voiced cutscenes which I found amusing. The scenes are mostly before you fight one of the bosses.\n\nThe soundtrack rocks too. I felt the need to pick it up off bandcamp almost immediately lol. They brought back the same guy that did Bot Vice's music. \n\nIt's even got a 2 player local co-op mode which is great if you have a buddy to play with! I've tried it both ways and enjoyed playing solo just as much personally. The main game's story lasted me about 8 hours and it took me another 2-3 to go back and collect all the achievements. I imagine I'll be revisiting it every so often since it's fun to play in short bursts.", "timestamp_created": 1496969810, "timestamp_updated": 1496969810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32268259": {"recommendationid": "32268259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198392444673", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496431234}, "language": "english", "review": "So far so good!

All of it is constant and lame pop-culture, fourth-wall breaking, etc.  Which isn't bad in and of itself, but bosses, for example, say their one or two \"hilarious\" references EVERY TIME they use an attack. The little bits of story are delivered via dialog and cutscenes of sorts, and is decently done, but so tacky and 'humor' focused that I just skipped it.\n\nHonestly without the attempted humor that falls flat I'd recommend this more strongly, and all in all it's my feeling that it takes away from the game rather than add to it.\n\nSometimes there are too many projectiles and moving bits on screen such that the ball becomes utterly lost, but overall it's pretty fun. I'd liken it to Wizorb and that sorta thing. I didn't try the local co-op, but that's an option.\n\nUltimately I'd recommend it for what it does well - a pretty tightly controlled block breaker with a few twists - spells, attacks (you can charge-up and reflect enemy attacks, giving you more options to break/damage than just the ball(s)), even if the game is hindered a bit by a super over-the-top and bad attempt at humor, unnecessary voice overs that don't add anything, and the same tired, overdone constant barrage of stupid pop culture -

Mucho m\u00e1s evolucionado y competente que aquel lejano t\u00edtulo de SNES llamado Firestriker; el objetivo de este Strikey es destruir todos los ladrillos con una de las dos protagonistas (o ambas si se juega a dobles), golpear la pelotita y a su vez defenderse y atacar a los enemigos, sirvi\u00e9ndose del movimiento est\u00e1ndar o de la propia pelota. Hay tres tipos de power-ups que har\u00e1n la tarea m\u00e1s sencilla. La palabra diversi\u00f3n es la clave: es divertido jugar, progresar, buscar secretos, capturar a los enemigos con el hechizo de la carta y descubrir el mapeado.\n\nLo bueno de S. Sisters es que no todo gira en torno a la pelota: podremos devolver los proyectiles enemigos a modo de contraataque, destruyendo as\u00ed m\u00e1s ladrillos o a los propios rivales. Los jefazos se llevan la palma, originales a rabiar y todo ello siempre con un puntito de Bot Vice reconocible en cada gr\u00e1fico, melod\u00eda e incluso en el sistema de juego. S\u00f3lido, de buena duraci\u00f3n y con una dificultad perfecta, ni f\u00e1cil ni dif\u00edcil, notando partida a partida c\u00f3mo vamos mejorando. Sobre el apartado gr\u00e1fico, sublime pixel-art (estos chicos tienen una de las mejores manos haciendo este tipo de gr\u00e1ficos de Espa\u00f1a), y una enorme OST con un toque noventero que har\u00e1 las delicias de los amantes de los 16-bits.

It's fun, addictive & gorgeous... but [strike]still has a few issues.[/strike] \n\n[i]UPDATE 7/30/2017: I've since beaten this game in just under 5 hours and have enjoyed the latest versions. The devs at DYA Games really tweaked, polished and refined this thing via post-launch updates, and I have to say... it is a [b]PHENOMENAL[/b] title now. [/i]\n\nI USED to have some slight issues, but they've all been cleaned up! Now the bounce physics & collision seem fair, predictable... they seem as good as they possibly could be. There's no more times when the ball will go flying in seemingly the wrong direction when you hit it while moving. There's no more instances where the ball seems to clip on corners and fly off in surprising ways. There's even a better drop rate for items like recovery chickens, and they even tweaked the amount of hits it takes to bust blocks in single player or multi player modes to improve the pace of each match and cut down on the tedium early on where you just want to destroy blocks to get some breathing room. Rounds no longer feel like they last a tad too long. This is now super polished and genuinely seems like an ideal version of the game they wanted to execute, and we all wanted it to be. [b]This is post-launch support done right![/b] :) \n\nThe player controls are really fantastic, and its one of those games where it's just fun to control the main character of your choice. There might be [i]a teeny bit[/i] of a learning curve here, but after short while, this goes from \"pretty good\" to \"super fun and addictive\". It can get difficult in places (at least until you learn to always prioritize ball return instead of going for power-ups), and you may take awhile to focus on the ball when there's VFX and particles going off everywhere during boss fights, but there's always lots of opportunities to get back in the game thanks to the power-ups enemies and blocks drop anyway. There's no big penalty for failing in the first place (just instantly try again). Its one of those games you end up just playing a bunch without noticing. Even when I lose, I'm finding myself going right back and retrying stages. \n\nThe main mode is also a bit of an \"RPG Lite\"-style design. With a world map and location \"nodes\", and a simple premise about going to find your pet presented via cute little cutscenes with sharp, funny dialogue. Its the kind of thing I wish WAY more arcadey games have, since I dug this kind of thing in games like Mario Tennis Power Tour for the GBA or Might & Magic: Clash of Heroes. Its super welcome to see Srikey Sister also frames its arcadey block-breaking action goodness in a mode like that :) \n\nBasically, Strikey Sisters delivers some big, BIG fun. It sports some really gorgeous faux 16-bit sprite art (no lo-fi, minimalist crap pixel art here!), and absolutely bleeds 90's Japanese game charm (the voiceover work even recalls charming 90's anime too!). Its also got some rocking chiptunes. This is just a really good design, whether you want some arcadey fun for a few hours or to just pick-up-and-play (and lose sometimes, and try again, and again, etc.).", "timestamp_created":

I love and hate it at the same time, and here's why:\n\nGraphics:\n[list]\n[*]PRO - The art style is spot on and fantastic; it's coherent and gives nostalgic vibes of the 80-90's arcade gaming era, levels show progression in style of pillars and backgrounds as well. Really, it's a work of art. BUT...\n[*]CON - We have a bad case of projectile and particle clutter and a major visual design fault at hand. The ball often doesn't stand out at all among the clusterporn of colorfully flashing missiles and drop items (and sometimes its own trail), and it quickly gets very frustrating to keep track of where it is.\n[/list]\n\nSounds:\n[list]\n[*]PRO - Music fits the gameplay, but all in all it's generic and forgettable. Not something you'd find yourself humming.\n[*]PRO - Sounds fit well into this kind of retro arcade genre, BUT...\n[*]CON - The absolute retronoisecorevisualkei that accompanies the already cluttered screen so that you don't even hear if the ball has already bounced or not under the pixelpuke it entered.\n[*]CON - The voice acting is simply hideous. I've heard zero-budget hentai dubs better than this. And oh boy, don't even get me started on the constant prattling of the bosses during the fight...\n[/list]\n\nLevels:\n[list]\n[*]PRO - Levels are diverse and provide a fair bit of a challenge.\n[*]CON - The difficulty curve is mostly a constant.\n[/list]\n\nEnemies:\n[list]\n[*]PRO - There's a LOT of enemies. Every map (except the secrets) introduces a new type of foe to spank. The designers literally went nuts with mixing up the most interesting cocktails of monster skills, from projectile-based attacks through teleportation skills to playing pong with you. They contribute a lot to the immersion. BUT...\n[*]CON - The AI is very unbalanced. Sometimes multiple enemies spam you with various skills at the same time, creating an impenetrable obstacle for the player, but there's something way more annoying...\n[*]CON - The spawning system is awful. enemies respawn too suddenly and sometimes right over the ball, which will then randomly shoot out of them as they die, or what's even worse, they spawn so close to the bottom that the ball I just hit back would be shot back out of the playfield.\n[*]CON - Skill windups are also poorly signaled. The player has very little time to anticipate an ambush-type attack among the random bright flashes cluttering the screen most of the time. There are just too many things to keep track at once.\n[/list]\n\nItems:\n[list]\n[*]PRO - There are quite a few drops you can get from chests or enemies, and all of them are useful in some way.\n[/list]\n\nStory:\n[list]\n[*]CON - Dialogues are generally one-dimensional, repetitive, anticlimactic. The story doesn't develop much. Chasing after a pet and shamelessly causing misery to everyone along the way for barely any justifiable reason makes the protagonists come off as arrogant, bigoted and unrelatable - they are even worse than the boss monsters.\n[/list]\n\nControls, Mechanics:\n[list]\n[*]PRO - The action is fast and the keyboard controls are responsive. Hit areas are intuitive and sometimes even generous, which makes the player feel more in control.\n[*]CON - The game doesn't pause on death, and the ball automatically shoots out after a few seconds of idle time. This means that you have to pause the game manually every time you need to take a break. I found it annoying that I couldn't rage at the screen and properly mourn over my failure before seeing the level fill back up to the brim and trying again.\n[/list]\n\nBugs:\n[list]\n[*]CON - I have to set full screen mode and \"Fit\" screen size every time I start the game because it starts in a tiny box in the middle of my screen (on Windows).\n[*]CON - Sometimes enemies may leave shadows or particle effects behind if killed at the wrong moment.\n[/list]\n\nSo, is this game worth its price?\nDespite being as frustrating as it gets, Strikey Sisters is still a rich experience and a powerful throwback, and if it's on a discount, it's worth giving a try.

Ausgehend vom 1976 erschienen Urvater \"Breakout\" wurden im darauffolgenden Vierteljahrhundert unz\u00e4hlige Spiele entwickelt, die auf der gleichen Idee basierten. Der bekannteste Vertreter d\u00fcrfte wohl das 1986 erschienene \"Arkanoid\" sein. Und der vielleicht interessanteste Vertreter erschien erstmals 1987 f\u00fcr C64 und hei\u00dft \"Jinks\". Ich sch\u00e4tze, das wird kaum jemand kennen (googelt es), aber darauf bezieht sich die \u00dcberschrift und es reicht hier zu wissen, dass es sowas wie die WTF-Interpretation des Genres darstellt. Und seit \"Jinks\" h\u00e4tte ich mir nicht tr\u00e4umen lassen, dass irgendein Spiel noch irgendwas Bedeutsames zum Thema Brick Breaker beitragen k\u00f6nnte. Ein Irrtum. Aber lest selbst.[/b]\n\n[h1]WIR WOLLEN UNSER HAUSTIER WIEDER HABEN[/h1]\n\nZuallererst: Strikey Sisters hat eine Story! Sogar stimmig vertont. Nat\u00fcrlich ist diese Story nicht unbedingt Literaturpreisverd\u00e4chtig, aber sie wird mit viel Witz und Charme in kleinen Zwischensequenzen erz\u00e4hlt und bettet das Spielgeschehen in einen durchaus sinnvollen Kontext. Aber worum geht's jetzt \u00fcberhaupt? Den beiden Geschwistern Elene und Marie wird eines Tages ihr Haustier Sachiro von einem gewissen Lord Vanik entf\u00fchrt. Und w\u00e4hrend die mehr zimperliche Elene tr\u00e4nenreich am Boden zerst\u00f6rt ist, fackelt die weniger zimperliche Marie nicht lange und begibt sich mit Elene auf die Suche nach Sachiro. Ab hier \u00fcbernehmt ihr. \n\n[h1]EINS, ZWEI, AUF DIE ZW\u00d6LF[/h1]\n\nEure Suche f\u00fchrt euch durch die gesamte im Fantasy-Setting angesiedelte Spielwelt, die sich in 12 Regionen unterteilt, die wiederum aus 5 Levels bestehen. Dabei erwartet euch in jeder Region ein Boss-Gegner. Sobald ihr euer erstes Level betretet d\u00fcrft ihr euch dann mit der spielerischen Cleverness von Strikey Sisters anfreunden. Nat\u00fcrlich geht es zun\u00e4chst auch hier darum, mit einer Kugel Steine abzur\u00e4umen, indem ihr sie mit der Kugel trefft. Nur steuert ihr in Strikey Sisters keine flache Plattform (paddle) am unteren Bildschirmrand, an der ihr passiv die Kugel abprallen lasst. Vielmehr spielt ihr eins der zwei M\u00e4dels, die per Handstreich eine magische Kugel in die Spielwelt schleudert. Das f\u00fchlt sich angenehm ein bisschen wie Baseball an. Warum das jetzt so anders ist? Nun, zum einen ben\u00f6tigt ihr einen Tastendruck, um die Kugel wegzuschleudern. Das f\u00fchlt sich schon mal viel weniger passiv an als in herk\u00f6mmlichen Brick Breakern. Zum anderen lassen sich die M\u00e4dels, wahlweise mit Gamepad oder Tastatur, ungleich pr\u00e4ziser steuern, als man das vom herk\u00f6mmlichen paddle gewohnt ist, welches ja im Grunde nix anderes ist, als ein verl\u00e4ngerter und in der Horizontalen gefangener Cursor. Dar\u00fcber hinaus k\u00f6nnt ihr euch, solange die Kugel nicht eurer Aufmerksamkeit bedarf, mit den auf dem Spielfeld befindlichen Monstern gewaltt\u00e4tig auseinandersetzen. Und das ist ein ebenso spa\u00dfiges wie durchdachtes Spielelement. Denn die augenf\u00e4lligste Schw\u00e4che eines Brick Breakers besteht f\u00fcr gew\u00f6hnlich darin, dass die Kugel f\u00fcr l\u00e4ngere Zeit ziellos durchs Level irrt, weil sich irgendein schwer zu erreichender Stein partout nicht treffen lassen will. Und das verdammt den Spieler zur Passivit\u00e4t. Dieses \u00c4rgernis bleibt bei den Strikey Sisters auf das unumg\u00e4ngliche Minimum reduziert, weil ihr auch noch andere Sachen zu bew\u00e4ltigen habt. Und die Monster, die solange respawnen bis der letzte Stein abgebaut wurde, heizen euch mit so manch fieser F\u00e4higkeit mitunter ganz sch\u00f6n ein. Insbesondere in den Boss-Levels wird der Bildschirm schnell zum regelrechten Kriegsschauplatz. Aber zum Gl\u00fcck seid ihr ja wehrhaft. Geschosse, die auf euer Ableben zielen, k\u00f6nnen per Schlagtaste geblockt werden. Kommen euch die Monster zu nahe, dann k\u00f6nnt ihr auch einfach auf sie eindreschen. Das kann allein schon zur Befriedigung von sporadisch auftretenden Rachegef\u00fchlen nach wiederholter Nahtoderfahrung sehr befreiend wirken. Ihr k\u00f6nnt auch mit einem aufgeladenen Schlag die Geschosse eurer Gegner ins Spielfeld zur\u00fcckschleudern. Und nat\u00fcrlich k\u00f6nnt ihr auch die obligatorischen PowerUps aufsammeln, die zum Beispiel eure Kugel verlangsamen oder zum Feuerball machen. Ihr k\u00f6nnt auch wirkungsvolle Zauber wie magische Geschosse ergattern, die dann mit Zusatztaste eingesetzt werden. Sehr hilfreich um Gegner zu eliminieren oder schwer erreichbaren Steine zu zerschmettern.              \n\nDer Schwierigkeitsgrad ist bei alledem \u00fcrigens nicht zu untersch\u00e4tzen. Ich empfand meinen Spieldurchlauf zwar insgesamt als recht ausgewogen, mit einerseits gen\u00fcgend Herausforderungen und andererseits weitestgehend frustfreiem und ausreichend fl\u00fcssigem Spielfortschritt. Zu Anfang war es aber schon recht fordernd. Die in den Optionen verf\u00fcgbaren Schwierigkeitsstufen ver\u00e4ndern \u00fcbrigens nur die Geschwindigkeit des Spielgeschehens. Fangt am besten mit leicht an und wenn ihr es drauf habt, dann erh\u00f6ht die Geschwindigkeit. \n\n[h1]J\u00c4GER UND SAMMLER[/h1]\n\nAls h\u00e4ttet ihr mit Monstern und B\u00e4llen nicht schon genug zu tun, k\u00f6nnt ihr in jedem Level auch noch Sch\u00e4tze ergattern. Diese Lagern in Truhen und die Truhen erscheinen auf dem Spielfeld, wenn ihr die erforderliche Anzahl von M\u00fcnzen eingesammelt habt, die ihrerseits aus zerschmetterten Steinen zum unteren Bildschirmrand purzeln. In den Truhen befinden sich entweder gro\u00dfe Edelsteine, die einfach gesammelt werden, oder aber sie enthalten eine Art magische Karte. Diese Karte k\u00f6nnt ihr wie ein Geschoss auf ein Monster abfeuern und wenn ihr es trefft, wird es dem spielinternen Bestiarium zugef\u00fcgt. Das ist durchaus eine ganz nette und motivierende Nebenbesch\u00e4ftigung. In einigen Levels befindet sich dann noch eine dritte Truhe. Wenn ihr die findet, dann erhaltet ihr Schl\u00fcssel zu versteckten Levels und in einem Fall sogar zu einem neuen Spielabschnitt.\n\n[h1]RETRO JA, ABER 2D-PIXELWAS?[/h1]\n\nStrikey Sisters pr\u00e4sentiert sich komplett im Retrolook. Sowohl grafisch als auch klanglich. Und ich mag das. Der Synthie-Soundtrack und die Pixelgrafik vermitteln sofort dieses alte AMIGA-Feeling, auf dem ich mich nach all den Jahren immer noch irgendwie heimisch f\u00fchle. Auch die niedlich animierten Sprites und das in sich stimmige Charakter- und Spielweltdesign gehen so in Ordnung. Was mich etwas st\u00f6rt ist der Begriff Pixel-Art. Wie gesagt, Strikey Sisters ist sch\u00f6n pixelig anzuschauen. Aber Pixel-Art ist das in meinen Augen noch lange nicht. Daf\u00fcr ist mir das alles einfach zu generisch. Und es soll da ja so 'nen RPG-Baukasten geben, ne? Ist nichts Verwerfliches, aber nochmal: Pixel-Art ist das NICHT!\n\n[h1]MECKERECKE[/h1]\n\nAu\u00dfer der nicht immer nachvollziehbaren Kollisionsabfrage gibt es ansonsten eher nur Kleinigkeiten zu bem\u00e4ngeln. Die manchmal fehlerbehafteten deutschen Untertitel in den Zwischensequenzen w\u00e4ren da beispielsweise zu nennen, ebenso wie die nicht immer textsynchronen Animationen. Hin und wieder m\u00fcsst ihr euch auch auf Frustmomente einlassen k\u00f6nnen. Wie gesagt, einige der gegnerischen Monster sind echt fies. Weniger ein Manko als eine vertane Chance ist der Umstand, dass sich die beiden Geschwister trotz ihres komplett gegens\u00e4tzlichen Temperaments v\u00f6llig identisch spielen. Da wurde strategisches Potenzial liegen gelassen, die dem Spiel mehr Abwechslung und der Charakterwahl einen Sinn verliehen h\u00e4tte. \n\n[h1]ICH PARSHIPE NICHT![/h1]\n\nDer Vollst\u00e4ndigkeit halber soll nicht verschwiegen werden, dass Strikey Sisters im Koop gespielt werden kann. Den konnte ich aus Ermangelung an physisch vorhandenen Spielpartnern nicht wirklich ausprobieren. Ich sch\u00e4tze das aber als ziemlich Spa\u00dfige Erfahrung ein. Aber wie es auch sei. Ich betrachte den Koop f\u00fcr dieses Review einfach als das nicht vermisste Schokoladenblatt auf einem supersahnigen St\u00fcck Spiel. \n\n[h1][b][u]FAZIT[/u][/b][/h1]\n\nMit cleverer Spielmechanik, witziger Story und viel Retrocharme entlocken die \"Strikey Sisters\" dem vermeintlich ausgereizten Brick Braker-Genre ungeahnte Spielspa\u00df-Qualit\u00e4ten!", "timestamp_created": 1516857671, "timestamp_updated": 1516857731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39563062": {"recommendationid": "39563062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066664695", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 689, "last_played": 1516731581}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo bem legal para passar o tempo.\nSImples, bata a bolinha nos quadrados e destrua todos os quadrados.", "timestamp_created": 1516731650, "timestamp_updated": 1516731650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40966538": {"recommendationid": "40966538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013064641", "num_games_owned": 473, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 740, "last_played": 1521681781}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n\n+Fantastic Pixel Art\n+Tight Controls\n+Adjustable Difficulty\n+Music\n\nCons:\n\n-I want more", "timestamp_created": 1521682303, "timestamp_updated": 1521682303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40940426": {"recommendationid": "40940426", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977834266", "num_games_owned": 464, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518205780}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was more than worth the .99 cents I paid for it, and it's even worth full-price.

The differences are all pleasant, though:\n- There are monsters on the stage who have different attacks/defenses (some can only be hit from behind, others will bat your ball back at you, etc.) who are bonus and bane at the same time - kill one and you get spells as powerups (some passive, like the Iron Ball that lets yours go through any bricks it hits until it bounces off a wall or indestructable object, and some more active, like summoning a lightning storm around the field to break things and kill monsters), but they also respawn until the bricks are all gone.\n- When the bricks are all gone, it's you just playing cleanup on the field with whatever monsters/bosses are still around. In the latter's case, if you survive X amount of time after the field is clear, they'll just crumble out of kindness, turning the game from destruction into survival.\n- There are a huge amount of optional challenges for you to take on if you've been playing the genre for a while: every brick that breaks drops a coin. Collect 50% of the coins on a stage to get a chest containing a card spell, to seal an enemy in the Bestiary. 60% coins puts out a chest that drops a gem, which, like the coins, you also have to catch before it drops off the screen. 70% will, on some stages, toss out a key in a chest for secret levels. (In the post-game bonus levels, these chests all turn into 3 stars you can collect for prestige.)\n\nBut the game's also solid in that you get co-op, and have a risk-reward system with charging up your strikes on the ball for better speed/power (it'll break a brick or kill an enemy in one hit at full power, while flying wildly), and that there are routines in place where if the ball gets stuck in a loop, it bounces out after two rotations, and... Little quality of life features that mean I would entirely say this game is fun and worth playing rather than ignoring everything since Breakout.\n\nIt's cool, it's cheap, and it is JAM PACKED with stages.

Continuing to experiment with genre fusion, this one's half brick-breaker(Breakout, Arkanoid) and half action rpg(Link to the Past, Gaia trilogy)...and the results are fantastic! It feels like it could've been released as early as the Turbo CD, and as late as the Sony Playstation. \n\nGraphically, this game feels like an authentic Super NES game. Great color palette, wonderful sprite art, and all the character designs are adorable. The only downside is that the screen can be a bit too busy. Sometimes the ball and your character can get lost in the action.\n\nThe sound design is where it starts to feel more like a a Turbo CD or Sega Saturn game. The music is CD quality. No chiptunes here. You also get voice acting. Now most people may write it off as \"bad voice acting\", but the style is intentional. It's an homage to the kind of voice acting you'll find in most disc-based games(and english dubbed anime)from the 90's. They were still figuring it out, and getting whoever they could to do it. This usually meant completely unknown voice talent. I absolutely love that they took this approach. It adds extra charm to the characters.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple. You move left and right, one button to attack/hit the ball, and another to use magic. Enemies will drop a variety of powerups, including speed boost, shield, multi-ball, as well as some attack spells. Also a lot of thigs to collect/levels to unlock, which means plenty of replay value! The only problem is that there is some slowdown when the screen gets too busy(just like a real SNES game!). That aside, the action is fast, fun, and addictive.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent game. If you like Japanese games from the 90's, then I strongly suggest you buy this game.

Different kinds of spells and stuff to gather give the game more stuff to do. For some reason though my gamepad could not \"decline\" to leave setting or so from the gamepad which was kinda odd but that was just a tedious thing and probably related to my setting more then the games itself.\n\nDo give it a try if you like Brick Breaking! :)", "timestamp_created": 1519824573, "timestamp_updated": 1519824573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40403103": {"recommendationid": "40403103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203771403", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519603212}, "language": "english", "review": "I played a brick breaker I don't remember the name of way back when and this game got everything right I liked about that one and actually added in things I didn't know I wanted.

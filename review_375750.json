But that's not what makes Invisigun Heroes a great game.\n\nWhat makes Invisigun great is the core gameplay. Until you fire (or bump into something), you're entirely invisible to everyone including yourself. This makes for some stunning emergent play choices. Most matches will see you wildly swinging between methodical, stealthy positioning, and frenetic button mashing as your ambush goes horribly awry and everything goes sideways.\n\nThroughout all of it, you have to keep your eye on the telltale signs of enemy passage and the sound of their footsteps as they cross different terrain, trying to determine their location so you can make them stumble into your killshot and snag the victory. The strategic choices are deep enough to create a high skill ceiling, but easy enough to grasp that they will eventually become intuitive. And this is a game that rewards intuition.\n\nThe character design choices are solid as well, offering a hero for any playtype you might prefer: mobility, recon, decoys, teleports, counters, even air strikes. All heroes have foils who are appropriate counters to them, and the base invisibility mechanic manages to level the playing field and give players a fighting chance even against heroes who would seem to be more powerful in a given matchup.\n\nJust to keep things interesting, the game air-drops power ups onto the field every 20 seconds or so (configurable), providing advantages like invisible/inaudible footsteps, shots that drop secondary bombs in adjacent tiles, reducing delay between shots, and a lot more. Not only do the powerups add to the gameplay but they create 'hot zones' on the map where you can be sure your enemy is heading, and try to intercept them.\n\nI also just want to add that there are many small, brilliant tweaks to prevent stale gameplay. For example, if two shots meet in midair, they cancel each other out - but also leave a small explosion that lasts a second, blocking further shots, giving you a moment to move and regain your invisibility if you want to and keeping the match from devolving into a straight slugfest.\n\nAll this is not to say that the game has no flaws Some maps will heavily favor one hero over another - for example, Iris (with dash ability) will excel on maps that are wide open. And some maps are just ridiculously assembled - there's a map in the kickstarter group that contains no possible jumps, crippling Celene who relies on jumps for mobility. And of course, at the time of this writing, the game is as-yet-unknown and it can be tough to find an online quickmatch. But with further tweaking, more maps, more heroes, and more visibility, I can see these nitpicks fading into the background, much as the heroes do after zapping an opponent. And you can always hop into the Invisigun Discord and find friendly players to challenge.\n\nAll in all, Invisigun Heroes is an ecstatic co-op experience that had me howling with joy while playing it. I cannot recommend it strongly enough for players who have a taste for fast-paced, intuitive strategy and frantic couch co-op action. Considering the high level of quality, it's hard to believe the studio is a one-person name. I did receive a copy of this game for free from a friend of the creator, but I easily would have purchased it on the strength of the demo -  especially at 35% off for the Christmas sale - and have already bought several copies for friends.\n\nPick it up today. You won't regret it.\n\nEDIT - I've used the words \"couch co-op\" a couple of times, and upon consideration, it's more appropriate to call it \"couch competitive.\"", "timestamp_created": 1514659252, "timestamp_updated": 1514662302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518790", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38774078": {"recommendationid": "38774078", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990585422", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488715055}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy this game for some of the BEST couch multiplayer action ever!

I mean, there are single player challenges, but they aren't nearly exciting as the online matches (as a parallel example, think of playing Loves in a Dangerous Spacetime solo versus in co-op). \n\nSo, while I would absolutely love to recommend the game to everyone for being fantastic (and, hopefully, to buff the number of online players), but... That is unfortunately its downfall. Not a lot of people playing means that people are going to be reluctant to grab it....which means that there aren't going to be a lot of people playing.

Easy to learn, difficult to master. Let's get this straight, there's only one reason this is a negative review and it's because the issues I describe here are still not fixed. Totalbiscuit is a bit of a chode and he's wrong about the playerbase issue, \"visibility\" for youtube's vast audience of vapid children is not Invisigun's biggest problem. I'll just nod in the direction of the ocean of diarrhea-content on yonder Twitch.\n\nGood news is this game is fun AF and all that's required to have a great time is literally three other players with a reasonable ping. That leaves absolutely no good reason for quickmatch not to immediately resolve a game. The playerbase can and will resurge when selecting quickmatch results in a game.\n\nRecommendations for options / features / fixes:\n\n    1. Kill the broken automated quick-match matchmaker. Allow players to filter by ping, region, language, gametype, etc. Players select tags, throw 'em on a filter stack, client allows players to select one from a shortlist.\n    2.  Retain players in the quick match-making queue by dropping them into universal, \"holding rooms\" where they can chat with other match-seekers. Games remain in the matchmaking queue, adding and removing bots as more players join or leave.\n    3. Enable match-browser whereby players can browse active games.  \n    4. Figure out a rework for match rooms to include more players, VOIP, chat, and spectate. If >4 players host selects the active players or rotation-mode, allow host to set banners, rules, passwords, etc. \n    5. Add friend-widget based on Steam's widget API; quick-join, chat, message, add friend, etc.\n    6. Add player stat-tracking system for tournament/ranked/ELO/ etc.\n\nShit, I'm a developer and I'd much rather work on games than business software.

play with and has patience to learn along side you, you'll quickly find yourself having an intense amount of fun.\n\nThere's a wide array of gameplay modes which make it incredibly replayable, the visuals are sharp and create a lot of interesting visual cues to help you keep track of yourself and enemies. The various heroes are unique and feel balanced.\n\nOn the topic of heroes though, some of the mechanics feel a little off, either intentional or not, which lead to some confusing moments. It would be nice if we had a test area where you could experiment with heroes without the invisibility so you could get a feel for them before you go into a live match.\n\nOnly major issue I have with the game is the way games are set up. While I totally get and appreciate the ability to create custom maps using codes you can share on the Discord channel, I feel like the lack of proper Steam integration makes creating and entering private games with friends is harder than it should be.

Obviously this is great party game but what surprised me is that the AI is pretty good. I saw a move from the AI last night that was so crafty, I had to watch the replay just to see how that it happened.\n\nReplays make this game great. You can study exactly what happened and what you can do to get better. But what I really like about replays is that you can easily save them in game as animated gifs to share with friends. A simple nice touch that makes this game all the better.\n\nThe variety of characters to choose from also give this game a great added layer of depth. While this game reminds me of the old bomberman games (which were great), all the characters were the same. Here each hero has uniquely different play styles.

Every prediction shot is a gamble that pushes the risk/reward balance between killing your enemies and revealing your position, this can be quite thrilling when you have to make these calls while simultaneously having an eye on what is happening on the map and keep track of your own invisible character.\nContrary to my expectations the game is a lot of fun when played online with random people, I originally thought of it as a pure couch co-op title. If you still want to be in voice with people to have some laughs about botched shots or marvel at impressive moves, there is an active community server on discord. Finding a public game also hasn't been an issue for me and playing from Europe on other servers like US East also provides you with a stable connection. [i](Update: Apparently I had some luck in the beginning, consistently finding public games isn't so easy after all. Still I was always able to find game through discord.me/invisigun[/i]). In addition to the multiplayer modes there is an extensive single player challenge mode with 3 difficulties, that can get you through an online drought.\n\nIn short: Invisigun Heroes is a highly entertaining and fast multiplayer game you can enjoy online or with friends, it really nails its concept and gives you single player content as a bonus.

Every game mode, character and planet is truly unique. \n\nThe core game play of invisible gunslingers is brilliantly entertaining. It allows you to play fast and furious, or slowly and carefully, all the while keeping an eye out for clues. You'll find yourself alternating between, stalking prey like some kind of alien or predator, and blindly firing like a panicked colonial marine. Good times!\n\nThey even offer a free demo.

Depending on players this game can be played differently. Sometimes you sneak and crawl trying to hunt down your enemy, sometimes it's a frenzy where everyone randomly shoots and person who decided to sneak up on behind rekts all other players. All characters have different abillities ranging from simple ones (jump, dash) to more complex ones.

I actually backed it on Kickstarter last year, because it's a fun idea...Bomberman meets the indie trend in  one-hit multiplayer battle games (Samurai Gunn, TowerFall, etc.), plus its own unique set of mechanics. That sounded cool, so I was glad to support the game. In execution, however, Invisigun Heroes isn't quite as polished as I would have liked. The battle arenas are a little too cluttered and claustrophobic, so you can't really \"hunt\" your opponents in the way that I was hoping for. The arenas are really meant for just two players, I feel, and didn't have the room to skulk around and plot your attack against three other players. The character portraits are so awesome and stylish, but the actual sprites are kind of generic and don't have much personality to them. The unique character powers are pretty good, but the basic ones are way too simple, in my opinion...everybody should really have had the ability to jump and dash. That's just a personal observation, though. What's much more significant is the fact that online multiplayer is basically dead. I can't find a public match to save my life. The search client just sits there forever, trying to track down public games that probably don't exist.\n\nI'm still going to give this a recommended review, strangely enough. The game is certainly fun for what it is. There are some cool game modes and local multiplayer is nice in small doses. If your gaming group enjoys co-op battle games, this is worth picking up on sale. It's not as great as a lot of other games in the genre and it's not going to replace Samurai Gunn for me and my group, but that doesn't mean it's a terrible game by any means. If you've put those other, better games through their paces and you want something new, this game's invisibility mechanic and unique design decisions will be worth a few laughs. I know this isn't the most compelling recommendation in the world, but I think that sometimes it's okay to say, \"this is a decent game that has some fun moments even if it isn't flawless or uniformally spectacular.\" I don't regret backing the game at all, but I do think it could have been a bit richer than it is.\n\nHowever, do NOT get this game if A) you're looking for a single player experience, or B) you want to get in on some online multiplayer action, because there's just nothing happening on that front.

For me though, this trumps both due to its plethora of game modes, maps, unique and diverse characters and, ultimately, the ribbon that ties it all together: the invisibility.\n\nIn Invisigun Heroes it's about reading your foes and anticipating their position; looking and listening for subtle cues -- footsteps in the sand/snow, splashes in the water, impact thuds against walls; cooking up strategies with your hero for the mode and map you're on; snagging pickups to aid your chances of success. Sometimes it's good to just stand still and use your senses to pinpoint players and make a surgical strike, other times you'll need to just use your intuition and bulldoze in there.\n\nIt blows my mind that this was made by one guy because it's so polished with a cracking little tutorial, field guide and hero profiles, a snappy UI as well as beautiful pixel art and a fittingly pulsing arcade soundtrack (Shadi Muklashy worked on the HAWKEN soundtrack which was also great).

I just want to say before I do and before we delve into the facts that subjectively this is my favorite game and I implore you to at least try it. The [b]free demo version is a great place to start hop on the invisigun discord[/b] https://discord.gg/KJ88HV and test it out for yourself because unless you are stressed for time that is one of the best ways to truly see if this holy grail of a game is for you. Anyway on with the main review.\n\nVisablity \n\nWhat is the first complaint I always see? Visibility. This game is a hard at first movement is a little tricky it will take getting used too 20-30min in and you will probably have a feel for it though and its just up from there. This is a key feature of the game and adds so much depth it is ridiculous. Ears become your new main sensory organ here. You can't just take away sight for people and tell them to go nuts. That just wouldn't work. This game adds huge audio clues and having fun at this gsme in the later stages is centric around understanding this simple sound step system. Headphones are certainly reccomended for this game it does include stereoscopic sound for steps. This is very very important for understanding where others and even yourself are located. This is easy to learn but hard to master which adds a great and fun curve to climb even at the highest levels of play people don't always know where someone is because of a thing called \"vertical juking\" where you pretend to go up and then go down and the such because you can't hear the difference in audio for the Y axis it can throw the person off and force them into a situation of uncertainty.\n\nCharacters-\n\nAbility- each character has a unique ability that is centric for gaining an upper hand on your opponent. The characters ability is simple and doesn't hold enough influence to force you into a play style every character has a pretty flexible range of play styles and each character caters to some form of play style So you have options most characters abilitys are easy to understand but vary in complexity. Overall every character besides maybe Epi are very intuitive even early on where a game or two with them and you get the jist of what you can do.\nVictory and dominance assertion/comedy- As of version 1.5 each character has a unique victory stance that you/and your friends can laugh at. With 8 characters 9 confirmed characters and possibly even more options are pretty varried. \n\nPlanets- There are five planets (possibly another at some point definitely more maps though)  12 maps for each planet to a total of 60 maps.\n\nPlanet:mechanics- each  planet has a unique theme and unique mechanics for it. To avoid making this too lengthy I'll talk about one of my favorite planet and its mechanics. Arenae has a desert theme. Sand piles slowly gather in certain spots that slow down shots as they pass through to a minimum speed.  Walking through sand piles or shooting them removes them till they collect enough sand to be interacted with again. Sand tiles leave footprints when walked over and make a very unique sound. Carpets simply make a unique sound when walked on. Triggered walls are walls that either go down or up dependant on their current position when you step on the or one of many buttons located on the map. Rays of light can appear on the outskirts of maps that if walked near are blocked out thus revealing your position. Water makes a unique sound and visual when walked over but it doesn't leave any lasting marks like sand.\n\nGame modes- these are already brushed up on if you simply look at the games description. They are all pretty neat but survival is surely the classic pick that represents the game very well.\n\nPlayer base- being a single developer indie game has kept this game out of the light for too long. My original review had a complaint with finding matchs but I no longer have that problem on the discord. Randomly searching for matchs I haven't tried in a while but is starting to look promising the way we have been growing recently. I implore and highly recommend you join the discord. We are all a very polite and relaxed group of people who are almost always down to play. [b] again the link to the discord [/b] https://discord.gg/KJ88HV\n\nEarly adopting- I don't mean to sound like a hipcat but joining the discord and adding in what you think and adding constructive cool/creative ideas is always welcome and can actually change the game quite a bit. Not that many people do it so id you share your ideas you might see not only a better game but a game you can say you helped make.\n\nReplay ability- this game has great replay ability because of online and how every match is going to be unique and constantly changing there is also a bot mode and a challenge mode that you can run through which is fun but plsying against a player is always more exiting. No worry about toxic behaviour either we try to keep that at an all time low in our discord as well as canned messages while playing the match they have been designed to be pretty lacking in BM potential.\n\nMore?-If you have any questions I haven't answered here or just want more direct and in-depth personal feedback please do not even hesitate to comment.", "timestamp_created": 1489971108, "timestamp_updated": 1505152785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525368", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30502329": {"recommendationid": "30502329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175304725", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485324237}, "language": "english", "review": "Backed it on kickstarter about a year ago, worth every penny.", "timestamp_created": 1489468924, "timestamp_updated": 1489468924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30478757": {"recommendationid": "30478757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308114174", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513732607}, "language": "english", "review": "A fresh concept with fun graphics and gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1489349715, "timestamp_updated": 1489349715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30477165": {"recommendationid": "30477165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026858060", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489348060}, "language": "english", "review": "Really great game, amazing to sit down and play with some friends or peeps on the official discord.\nThe community is very small so you probably wont games reliably, but being active on the discord and knowing when people group up to play is a good way to play semi-regularly\n\nIts very very hard to recommend this game with how tiny its community is right now, but the game itself is amazing, so take that as you will.", "timestamp_created": 1489344583, "timestamp_updated": 1489344583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30475053": {"recommendationid": "30475053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052320460", "num_games_owned": 339, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502651572}, "language": "english", "review": "For long I've searched for a game like Invisigun Heroes, one that takes you back to those good old bomberman times, just gathering beside one computer to outplay each other, in all good fun.

Much like Crypt of the Necrodancer, I could tell this concept would be very fun to me, and I was not wrong.  But I think the concept of this game would be fun to *everyone* if they would just give it a chance.  This is the most fun game I've played in a long time.\n\nFirst off, at its core this is a multiplayer competitive game like classic Bombermans or any arena fighter/shooter.  If you only like single-player games and have no friends: then Invisigun probably isn't for you.  You don't need to read anymore.  If however, you love laughing (and crying) with your friends through hilarious sets long into the night: you're almost doing yourself a disservice by not owning this game.\n\nGameplay:  The best.  The concept is easy to explain and the movement is snappy and grid-based.  Everyone is invisible, even you, but you can count steps and keep track of where you are without revealing yourself.  Shooting, using your chosen character's ability, bumping into anything accidentally, or walking through certain environments, all reveal you briefly.  There's a strong element of deception and prediction to the game.  I'll shoot a few times in a row walking forward along the bottom hallway of a map, then immediately stop and go back around a different way.  My antsy opponent will shoot down where I made him think I'd be, giving away his position.  And a few seconds later I shoot him from an angle he totally did not expect.  There are 8 characters and 50 maps right now, with 7 modes playable on every map and a lot of fun powerups.  The game is planning on having even more stuff added though.  It also supports local and online matches in any combination.  You can have only one friend over and game together on your PC and still take that lobby online to get 2 randos.  The netcode is surprisingly good for an indie game and the distances I play it at.  I have playable matches with people halfway around the world, which is more than I can say for Street Fighter V.  The only real potential flaw with the gameplay is that some stubborn players who refuse to think will just not get it.  You have to put in just a bit of effort to really enjoy this game and get decent at it.  People who won't even do that tend to (wrongly) dismiss the game as \"all luck\"\n\nGraphics:  Solid.  This has some of the best tile art and effects I've seen in a game at this resolution, no pixel out of place.  Unfortunately the character sprites themselves in-game are the weakest part of the art, but they also spend most of the game being invisible.  By contrast, their full size art on the hero profiles and character select screens looks great.  Overall it's easily some of the bext pixel art around and quite a bit more stylized and less lazy than the endless storm of lazy games on steam cashing in on the words \"pixel art\" with no effort to prey on nostalgia.  In Invisigun, clearly deliniated tiles are important to the gameplay.  And these maps would make most SNES and GBA classics jealous.\n\nSound:  Great.  Every planet has two music themes and they are all really great, bass-heavy and jammin.  The main menu theme is alright but the loop is a little short, which can get repetitive if you are waiting on it for a while.  SFX are top notch and designed very well, with positional sound based on where the invisible enemy players are and different foot steps for every type of terrain.You'll want to turn the SFX above the music and any voice chat you're using, and also wear headphones.  A combination of subtle audio and visual cues are how you will figure out the positions of your opponents by their small mistakes.  The game supports turning the music all the way off if you'd rather play your own, but you're missing out if you haven't heard all of the planet themes yet.\n\nIn summary, Invisigun Heroes is actually fun in a way that I haven't enjoyed in a while.  It's rewarding in a way that games used to be with my friends when I was growing up, with the right combination of skill and luck that everyone had fun without being too far on the luck side to be watered-down garbage like Mario Kart.  I'm not spilling over with rage when I lose in Invisigun Heroes, which is a very different feeling than many other games in my Steam library; a much better feeling.  Right now the game is still in its early days and the community is very small, but it's also friendly and not a wretched hive of scum and toxicity like your MOBA of choice.  So not only is the game fun and non-threatening, but so are the players.  I only wish the community was a bit bigger, but it'll get there.  Maybe you can help it get there?\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1488065955, "timestamp_updated": 1488065955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587642", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30163522": {"recommendationid": "30163522", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998876045", "num_games_owned": 481, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "last_played": 1515867388}, "language": "english", "review": "Get some people together to play this game (over voice chat or locally) and you will have an absolute blast.\n\nDon't try to go online, don't play by yourself, it is not fun for so many reasons mostly due to the way the game is designed.\n\n\nOk so my old review below is still completely relevant -> if you're just picking this up for yourself and have no one you know to play it with.

It made me doubt my initial judgement, so I picked the game back up to see if I was wrong and to record my experience/issue so there's no doubt what I'm talking about.\n\nPros:\nPretty pixel art\nNice music \nMany stages\nSolid netcode\n\nCons:\nThe multiplayer/\"matchmaking\" system is garbage, instead of having 1 \"matchmaking\" button where it just finds the closest people who is also searching for games it has an old outdated \"Host\" and \"join\" system, where you either have to host or join to find a game. meaning for example, 2 people could be wantint to play the game, go to the join section for 5 minutes, with no luck and then both go to host, even though there are two people wanting to play they don't get to play because of the way the game is set up. This is by far the biggest issue with this game, combined with the small playerbase a game like this will naturally have, and the absurdly high pricetag you have a stillborn game. The developper says they're working on this and if this is fixed along with the price I see myself picking the game back up and I might change the review to positive.\n\nMovement IS NOT 1:1, but you have to time your presses, this causes the game to be unnesesarily unpredictable in my oppinion. The developper commented on my last review that this is untrue and misleading. I doubted myself and picked the game back up and took a video of the issue, now noone can really claim that it's misleading. seasoned players will naturally pick the timing up and will probably not even make individual key presses most of the time, but it is an unnesesarily frustrating aspect of the game especieally for a new player.\n\nPlease click this link to see what I mean: https://youtu.be/4jWZIh4zOSw", "timestamp_created": 1488019105, "timestamp_updated": 1504021354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469434", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30162570": {"recommendationid": "30162570", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997580809", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500989858}, "language": "english", "review": "Intense, fun with friends, definetly will play more.

The concept of playing as an invisible character leads to a lot of interesting strategies, and keeping track of myself is a challenge that I've never experienced in a game before. The wide variety of modes, maps, and playable characters, not to mention bots and the single player challenge mode, add enough content to fully warrant the $15 price tag. I particularly like how many stage gimmicks there are that really change the game around. My favorite so far has to be the lightning which briefly reveals all players. The sound and art are also amazing. In particular, the visual distortion effects are superb.\n\nMy only real negative is the lack of an online player base. It's difficult to find matches, and there usually aren't any at a given time. You can host your own matches, and it doesn\u2019t take too terribly long to find somebody, but waiting for a third and fourth person would probably take a while. I think that if the menu was cleared up to prominently feature a \"Host Public Match\" button right next to the \"Join Public Match\" button, or if a player matchmaking queue was implemented, this problem could probably be mitigated to some extent. I don't entirely buy that the lack of online activity is due to lack of player interest. Also, there's always the public discord server for finding matches if you want to go the extra mile, but that is in no way a permanent solution.

Everyone is invisible but firing your gun or using your character's signature ability causes you to become temporarily visible. In addition environments are designed with small features that give away your location (walking in water causes splashes, snow leaves foot prints, windows casting light will have the light obscured if your standing in the way, etc.). Game is playable locally with up to 4 players. The AI is very smart-but fair. Gameplay is addicting, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys co op games in a similar fashion to Bomberman or Towerfall.", "timestamp_created": 1486870998, "timestamp_updated": 1486870998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591837", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29863137": {"recommendationid": "29863137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191864505", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486868309}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a good game novel style and creative design but it\u2018s too difficult for noob~ yes im noob ~I Played the thirty HARD game all lose~So I gave up\n\n\n\u597d\u6e38\u620f\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u592a\u96be\u4e86 30\u628a\u56f0\u96be\u6a21\u5f0f\u5168\u8f93\u2026\u2026QWQ", "timestamp_created": 1486868839, "timestamp_updated": 1486868839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29862067": {"recommendationid": "29862067", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066250885", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487078071}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8bdd\u7528\u65e5\u672c\u7ebf\u8def\u6bd4\u8f83\u7a33\u5b9a\u70b9\uff0cping\u4e5f\u4f4e\uff0c\u6709\u670b\u53cb\u4e00\u5757\u73a9\u662f\u6781\u597d\u7684\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\u51fa\u4e86\u56fd\u670d\uff08\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u4e0d\u5927\u5427\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u73b0\u5728\u4e5f\u80fd\u73a9\uff09\u6781\u597d\u7684\u3002\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1486863982, "timestamp_updated": 1486863982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29848791": {"recommendationid": "29848791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031325171", "num_games_owned": 816, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487199771}, "language": "english", "review": "Invisigun - what an absolutely glorious indie gem!  If you read no further, go with your instinct and give this title a chance at the asking price \u2013 it\u2019d be *criminal* to pass this one by.  An amazing distillation of so many classic favourites from over the decades, combined with unique and highly clever mechanics, Invisigun has sunk its hooks into me from the first moment, and I can't wait to experience more.  Think Bomberman with beautiful classic Zelda-inspired graphics, hints of Power Stone, and frissons of several other \u201cgreats\u201d.  And don\u2019t even get me started on the soundtrack!  Only a few hours in, I\u2019m already awestruck by the love and polish evident in every aspect, the simple-to-learn-but-hard-to-master gameplay, and the genuine and immediately-apparent FUN.  I don\u2019t say this lightly \u2013 I see genuine brilliance evident in this game and give mad respect to its one-man developer.  \n\nTaking the narrow view, it's a great \"party game\" \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t take much effort to reveal oh-so-much more under the surface.  There's real strategy and skill involved, to be developed over a long period of practice and experience.  Yes, it\u2019s easy to jump into, but even in my first online multiplayer matches with evenly-matched opponents, I was finding myself embroiled in satisfying sparring matches of bluffs, jukes, and mindgames to anticipate the location of the competitors and bait them into my traps whilst avoiding the same in return.  This is a case of satisfying my inner-competitive-strategist, but in digestible periods of time which work well with a busy lifestyle \u2013 a typical first-to-5-wins match often takes only five to ten minutes!  Speaking of longevity, there are already 50 unique maps at launch, with deformable and otherwise-dynamic terrain, each of which favours unique strategy and caters to the skills of different characters.  But I\u2019m told there are already more maps on the way, and even another character!\n\nI\u2019m clearly all in favour of Invisigun but, as with any game at launch, there are a few issues that could be improved.  And those mostly involve the online matchmaking.  While it can be fun to learn maps by sparring with the bots in offline singleplayer, this game is undoubtedly at its best in live multiplayer.  And there *are* people playing online! - but you wouldn\u2019t necessarily know it unless you jump onto the Discord channel.  You see, there is no online server browser \u2013 you can only choose which region (or \u201call\u201d/\u201dbest\u201d regions) you wish to connect to, then search for an open match to jump into.  But unless a host is actually sat in their created lobby, waiting for players to join, then you won\u2019t know the server even exists because you cannot join matches in progress, even to sit in the lobby.  And if a multiplayer match is partially filled out with bots (optional), then those bots fill the available slots for human players to join.  So for all practical purposes right now, you\u2019ve got to jump onto the Discord channel and do your matchmaking there.  However, the developer seems to be very aware of these issues and I have faith that they will be addressed in due course.  On the other hand, my early interaction with the player community through Discord has been an entirely positive experience!\n\nTo me, this game is a real treasure find \u2013 the kind I sift through endless product release pages and games bundles hoping to discover.  I had no idea it even existed before launch, and it arrived without any hype on Steam.  Were it not for a casual glance at the \u201cnew releases\u201d list for the day and a few minutes with a Twitch stream by LEMental,  it might have passed me by entirely.  What an unjust fate that such an expertly crafted and outstanding title be left unnoticed by the masses due to underexposure.  Well! - hopefully those of us lucky enough to find it, and sing its praises, bring more of our fellow gamers into the fold!  One only needs to know it it exists and to try it, then the quality of the game speaks for itself.  So grab it, then come find us on Discord! https://discord.gg/ycEhg2Q", "timestamp_created": 1486823062, "timestamp_updated": 1486823062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688984", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29847760": {"recommendationid": "29847760", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144019215", "num_games_owned": 310, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504935722}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u6709\u4e50\u8da3\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u8d77\u8054\u673a\u7684\u4eba\u6709\u70b9\u96be(((\n\n609929722<-\u5bf9\u6218\u7fa4\u4e00\u8d77\u6765\u73a9\u561b....", "timestamp_created": 1486820248, "timestamp_updated": 1486820248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550422", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29835453": {"recommendationid": "29835453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084101201", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502524878}, "language": "french", "review": "Un v\u00e9ritable coup de coeur. \nUn Gameplay super original faisant un peu penser \u00e0 Bomberman, une Bande-son vraiment sympa et des graphimes en pixels tr\u00e8s jolies.\nPour l'instant on peu rencontrer quelques difficulter \u00e0 trouver une partie \u00e0 moin de l'h\u00e9berger soit-m\u00eame.

I followed it intensely, and had a month where I was checking my email and the forums multiple times every day just so I could get even a scrap of news about it. As soon as I got it, I promptly annoyed my friends incessantly to play with me. Sadly, I ended up playing mostly with bots. :Neko: That was fine, though. Even with the three worlds that there were when I got it, there was still a ton to do. The game only went uphill from there. Much to my delight, the bots AI was improved immensely until they actually became as good as a real player. Two new planets were added, full of new mechanics. New heroes were added, and the gameplay was completely changed based on the discussions on the forums. This game kept getting better and better, and it won't stop now. The dev is one of the best I've seen, and sure knows how to make a great game. Honestly, this game coudld go down in history as one of the first and THE best to pull off \"everyone is invisible.\" (A surprising amount of companies have started developing games shockingly similar to this.

A very interesting take on the 4 player top down party style game. A must have for anyone who likes games such as Towerfall or Samurai Gunn. But, this game blows those games out of the water with it's extra features (online multiplayer) and novel mechanics.\n\nBasics: Everyone is invisible. You can move on a grid orthogonality (up, down, left, right). Each step makes a noise. When you fire or use an ability (8 different characters) it reveals you for a short time. If you bump into or walk over certain terrain it can give away your location subtly via sounds or animation cues.\n\nGraphics: If you like the pixelated art style, they NAILED IT!\n\nMusic: The diverse scores capture the feel of the different planets (5). I could listen to most of them on repeat.\n\nSound Effects: Sound is SO IMPORTANT in this game and they did a fantastic job at conveying things like footsteps to the players. I highly recommend headphones. I feel that people with hearing impairments will struggle with this game but it's not unplayable.\n\nMultiplayer: Multiplayer is the core of this game. Invisigun Heroes allows you to play cross platform (Linux, Mac, Windows) multiplayer with anyone in the world. You can also add more local players seemlessly. There is basic matchmaking and you can even host private ip games. There is no online communication (you will want to join the discord).\n\nControls: Keyboard can be remapped to be any controls. This game is meant for controller though. My Xbox360 controller and iBuffalo classic USB gamepad worked like a charm. This game can be a little tricky to get your berrings on where you're at. I can see new players being frustrated by that learning curve.\n\nGamemodes: There are 7 different gamemodes of everything you might want in a game like this, all of which are free for all (no teams (\u3063- \u2038 \u2013 \u03c2) ).\n\nTLDR Pros/Cons:\n\nPros: Cross platform local/online multiplayer (up to 4 playes/bots), fantastic pixel art, great retro inspired music, 50 stages, 7 gamemodes, easy to understand, high skill cap.\n\nCons: Free for all only (no teams), no real singleplayer game (bots only), learning curve to move while invisible, no online chat.\u200b", "timestamp_created": 1486577046, "timestamp_updated": 1490578041, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.763208", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39501918": {"recommendationid": "39501918", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969918459", "num_games_owned": 864, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 88, "last_played": 1516512643}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow.

Most folks I've played with ended up purchasing it.\n\nGreat and unusual versus game.", "timestamp_created": 1516512822, "timestamp_updated": 1516512822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39488217": {"recommendationid": "39488217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149310581", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 253, "last_played": 1516501488}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a blast. The unique premise is executed very well and makes for an addictive game you can quickly pick up and play for a round, or sink hours into at a time.\n\nWhat really suprised me is the amount of content in the game. There are 67 maps across 6 different planets that have different layouts, aesthetics and gimmicks, 9 characters with different powerups, 7 unique game modes and a suprisingly fun and relaxing single player mode that should take you 5-10 hours (depending on the difficulty a lot).\n\nThe only issues I have with the game is that going from round to round can take a bit longer than I'd like (though it's definitely not egregious), occasional crashes with intel graphics (the game is lightweight and ideal for laptops) and there aren't enough people playing it!\n\nThe game is well designed, well executed, polished and definitely worth the price, so go buy it and contribute to the player pool!", "timestamp_created": 1516467892, "timestamp_updated": 1516493781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501511", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 179, "total_negative": 11, "total_reviews": 190}}

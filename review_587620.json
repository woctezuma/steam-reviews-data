Who shares my steam library.\n\nThis is their experience of the game.\n\nOkami truly is a gem in the gaming industry's dust.\n\nI have to say this game is evocative of the older generation of action games. It contains its share of tricky challenges as well  as the distinct way in which the plot unravels. But it wouldn't pique my interest had the atmosphere not been as warm and soulful. \n\nOkami is a contrast of humour and tragedy, folk and modern as well as a harmonious combination of action and adventure. Throughout the game I experienced heartfelt sorrow and joy, tender emotions brought about by Ammy's dorkiness, irritation at my own ineptitude as a god doge and so on and so forth.\nI knew what was in store for me the moment I heard about Orochi and Amaterasu. Further on in the game there are many more allusions to japanese folklore and religion, such as: [spoiler]The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, Age of the Gods, Kojiki...[/spoiler]\n\nAs for the visual part of the game, it's a cel-shaded one (which in no way detracts from its beauty; on the contrary, it gives the game a unique comic touch along with smoothness). Moreover, it is an HD version, so the quality is further improved. Personally, I have no qualms about the graphics whatsoever. \n\nI would recommend this game to people who are in for a good adventure game and are good sports about lack of adequate voiceover; it suits casuals (dw, it's not Dark Souls) and completionists (<-tons of collectibles~).", "timestamp_created": 1516480620, "timestamp_updated": 1516480620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

Es ist ein fantastisches Action-Adventure nach Art der The Legend of Zelda-Reihe, jedoch mit vielen eigenen Ideen.

Die Story ist auch ein gro\u00dfer Pluspunkt, denn die Abenteuer der G\u00f6ttin Amaterasu sind lang und voller interessanter Twists. Gerade wenn man denkt, es sei vorbei, \u00f6ffnet sich ein neues Gebiet mit einer neuen riesigen Questline und weiteren interessanten Charakteren mit eigenen Geschichten und Nebenquests.

Einfach - man verzeih den Wortwitz - g\u00f6ttlich!\nJedoch ist es kein perfektes Spiel: Der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist in meinen Augen zu niedrig, die Dungeons - ein weiteres Element, dass direkt der The Legend of Zelda-Reihe entnommen scheint - sind zu kurz und die darin enthaltenen R\u00e4tsel wieder viel zu simpel.

Exploration is rewarding, but honestly your first time through will feel a little overwhelming in terms of abilities you get late game that opens up areas as far back as the very beginning of the game.\n\nCombat, when it happens, is either too easy or too demanding where again, the game doesn't always do a good job with telling you what it expects.  It will painstakingly hold your hand with the first couple of enemy types, but then other times completely forgo any explanation in a game where you have half a dozen combat options and only one or two work with certain enemies.  Combat also doesn't vary itself often.  While there's technically maybe over 30 kinds of enemies, there's maybe only 10 with some variation of looks, health, and slight tweaks to behavior.  The basic enemy you encounter the first time and the few after that basically serve as the templates for what you'll encounter the rest of the game.  There's something to be said about the main mechanic of the game, the brush techniques, breaking up the pace of combat, though personally I found it had it's own sort of flow though at times felt too much like micromanaging myself.  Really the only complaint I'd have here is with enemies having a certain weakness, you need a source of that weakness somewhere within the battle zone or figure out some of the secret and costly techniques.\n\nSpeaking of which, you can upgrade some of your techniques..... and it really doesn't feel like doing so has much impact on what you can or can't do sadly.  Finding the secret techniques is also a little lackluster, or often too little too late.  Really the one positive I can say is that there is a bomb ability and later just being able to have the ability to place more than one helps make up for the fact that placing them can be finicky between the camera and where you draw them.\n\nEnvironments are pretty cool, though I think as the game goes on the design of them gets progressively weaker.\n\nThis technically being my second playthrough with my first on the Wii, I can also say that playing this game on a controller, while lacking the novelty of the motion controls, felt better overall and that I had a lot more control over what I was doing.\n\n100%ing this game is also not the greatest.  While the in-game consideration for 100% is forgiving, there's certain sections of the game that leave something to be desired.  Collecting all of the 100 (99) beads is tedious without some sort of guide as there's just some activities and side quests you'd probably never notice without meticulously talking to every NPC, and even then I recall a few of them where if I didn't use a guide I would've never figured it out on my own.  Treasure hunting feels much more like a chore than anything rewarding.  Earning the quivalent of experience breaks up the game when interacting with the animals found throughout the game.  There's some stupidly missable enemies that you can only ever encounter once without a second playthrough to fill out the beastiary, and feeding all of the animals on the map is not only tedious but doesn't really reward you with anything neither.  Don't even get me started on the fish tome, which isn't the worst grind I've experienced in a game but it certainly is a task with no real in-game reward either.\n\nGame certainly has additional playthroughs in mind.  Not that those playthroughs have any additional content to offer, but it allows for you to really kind of take in the game a bit more.  Find what you might've missed the first time without having to go all the way back to a previous save.  You'll still have much of the same progress you had from the previous game with all of your upgrades, though you'll need to find much of the same items all over again.  If you do complete the game in certain categories, you'll be rewarded with the ability to change your appearence cosmetically, so if the 100% is on something other than your first playthrough you don't need to be bored by the same visuals.  I won't spoil what you get for collecting all of the beads, but it's a reward that is worth the trouble you would've put into getting them all.  All of that said though, I would've prefered being able to change my appearence while going through the game normally, and the ultimate reward is really only something you'd really get to experience only if you REALLY like to play this game.  I realize the original release was on the PS2 and these were the limitations of the time, as well as the usual designs, but I really wouldn't recommend 100%ing the game unless if you're really enjoying yourself with it, much less a second playthrough since there really isn't much to offer outside of your first.\n\nOverall though, the game is fun and would be something I'd recommend to people.

The game has so many great mechanics like upgrades and minigames and collectibles.  Each area is so unique and beautiful.  Each moment in this game is so very memorable.

I've waited such a long time for this to be remastered on PC and am glad that all other platforms get to experience it now as well.\n\nI have no idea how to describe this game but I can agree with some other reviews that this is a hilarious take on Japanese mythology. You obviously play as a wolf but you've been inhabited by the Japanese sun goddess Amaterasu. I don't want to spoil the story any but you basically fight off demons and monsters to save villages and befriend villagers. Your ultimate goal is to undo the damage caused by evil and restore their world.\n\nAs Amaterasu your abilities in and out of combat will vary, you can generally always use the celestial brush but weapons are combat specific. The brush is a utility out of combat with more combinations than I'd prefer to list, and it's a weapon in combat to be used alongside your main weapons.\n\nThe environments are vast and beautifully designed considering the age of this game. The villagers and entities within them have a lot of depth to their characters with most having a considerable amount of dialogue. I find it comical how only some can see your true form and everyone else just sees some random wolf, it can lead to some great conversations. On that topic nobody in this game actually speaks words, they only mumble or mutter, so the entire game is subtitled no matter what.\n\nI do have some gripes though:\n-Related to the conversations themselves, some of the dialogue comes on a bit strong with the self-discipline and strive for perfection in whatever it is they're doing. It's not bad but I feel it takes away from your own story, it's distracting.\n-The transitions can get annoying, between areas, day/night cycle, feeding the animals, and every single item you pick up. I understand the loading screens between areas as it was a PS2 game originally. But why was there a paused transition for the day/night cycle, interrupting you every time? Feeding an animal will also cause it to load a little scene where you... feed an animal... every single time. The item pickups really didn't need this either, pausing the action and giving me two panels of descriptions on what the item is and what it does. At 30 hours in, pretty sure I know what the bones do.\n\nThose gripes are minor though and aren't going to destroy the story or gameplay for you.

Una aventura que recuerdo que el mismo lo daba como el gran final. La meta estaba ah\u00ed, frente a mis ojos, pero no quer\u00eda que terminara. No quer\u00eda que se terminara esta hermosa aventura. Pero para mi sorpresa, el juego sigui\u00f3, Y UN BUEN RATO!. Esa experiencia de desear que esto no se terminara, se cumpli\u00f3, pero como todo tiene un final, no pude estar mas contento con el viaje y las memorias que me ha dejado.\n\nOkami para mi gusto es una joya. Un diamante en bruto que Capcom nunca tuvo intenciones de pulir apropiadamente, vi\u00e9ndose reflejado en las pobres ventas de PS2 y Wii. Jamas fue un titulo, digamos, que le diera mucho prestigio a la empresa, pero si por el boca a boca de la gente que realmente am\u00f3 hasta el hartazgo este juego, lo que tambi\u00e9n dar\u00eda el batacazo del mejor estudio creativo que tuvo Capcom en su \u00e9poca.\n\nMas all\u00e1 de que tenga una relaci\u00f3n de amor-odio con Capcom (y tambi\u00e9n mas de uno o millones sientan lo mismo) tengo que decir GRACIAS!. Gracias por traer a Ammy e Issun a Steam. Siempre ped\u00ed, desde el fondo de mi coraz\u00f3n que saliese para la plataforma PC. Siempre. Vaya a saber por que divina intervenci\u00f3n haya pasado por Capcom, pero esta fue una de mis grandes sorpresas del 2017 y nunca estuve mas contento de volver a jugar Okami. De volver a sentirme nost\u00e1lgico, re\u00edrme con sus personajes e historias, llorar cuando las emociones estaban a flor de piel, de perder horas y horas y escuchar su hermoso soundtrack.\n\nMas all\u00e1 de los aspectos t\u00e9cnicos y problemas que se presentan por ser un juego de hace dos generaciones atr\u00e1s, el port a PC es \u201ccorrecto\u201d.

Otras como el sistema de salvado y el plataformeo pueden llegar a parecer muy viejos.\n\nNo lo se. Para mi Okami es y sera una obra de mucho amor que habla de sus desarrolladores y que, pese a lo que es, Hideki Kamiya es un loco genio. Un director que pocos entender\u00e1n, pero que sus juegos est\u00e1n llenos de potencial.\n\nOriginalmente iba a hablar un poco de como es que Okami cuenta ciertos relatos mitol\u00f3gicos como el de Susano y Yamata-no-Orochi y el papel que cumpli\u00f3 Amaterasu (que si vamos al caso toda la premisa del juego es basicamente dicho relato) pero termino siendo un poco de como es que Okami es parte de lo que soy como jugador hoy en d\u00eda y todo lo que representa en mi vida.\n\nOkami es un juegazo y pasado ya 11 a\u00f1os, sigue demostrando que puede aullar como todo un lobo alfa.\n\nEn pocas palabras, mi primer gran amor con un videojuego.", "timestamp_created": 1515859978, "timestamp_updated": 1515860778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697137", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39311180": {"recommendationid": "39311180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198370757000", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1810, "last_played": 1516449245}, "language": "english", "review": "A really beautiful game and a must play if you like japanese myths or a game with funny dialogues.

Sim, o grande diferencial na jogabilidade de Okami \u00e9 a intere\u00e7\u00e3o com o mapa, inimigos e personagens em geral por meio de desenhos. Tudo isso poderia ter sido simplificado com menus ou combos com os bot\u00f5es, ao inv\u00e9s disso, voc\u00ea tem que utilizar o pincel, voc\u00ea tem que interagir diretamente com o jogo e isso desperta um sentimento de import\u00e2ncia.

Com a Capcom tomando a frente desse t\u00edtulo nas terras do Tio Sam, esperava um trabalho melhor na linguagem. \n\nUm ponto muito forte do game \u00e9 que, se comparado com outros t\u00edtulos de peso, Okami entrega muito conte\u00fado por um pre\u00e7o baixo.

I don't know but I'll try.\n\nIn Okami, you play as Amaterasu, the Shinto goddess of sun manifesting herself in the form of a white wolf. All along, a sprite named Issun accompanies you and becomes your voice. As your celestial form isn't openly visible to humans, they keep mistaking you for a random mutt. But you learn to live with that after a while.\n\nYou delve into a beautifully crafted world. And honestly, words fail to shine even a tiny bit of light on how spectacular the art in this game is. I could just rant on and on about it without ever getting tired. The visuals alone can easily captivate you for hours on end. \n\nSo throughout your journey, you learn new brush techniques. You can pause the game at will by pressing Ctrl and draw the symbols you have learnt to pull awesome tricks. Cut a baddie, a solid rock or even a whole bunch of trees in half in one invisible slash? The celestial brush got you covered. You want to start a fire, make it rain for real, start a galestorm or bring down a heavenly thunderbolt on thy enemies? Easy peasy fam! \n\nYou obtain these techniques gradually and they allow you to access new stuff and areas in a Zelda-like fashion. Though I really don't like the comparison, because Okami is by all means its own masterpiece of a game. \n\nThe story is all you would expect from a narrative of ancient Japanese myth. While it may not be all magically new or refreshing, it is just enough to be relevant. Not to mention the constant slapstick humor. The story is never presented in an overly serious manner. You are always given your moments of giggly fun. I don't know, you should just try \"golden fury\" and \"brown rage\" on mythical demons to taste a piece of it for yourself.\n\nAll in all the only things some PC players (especially newer-gen players) will dislike are the occasional unskippable dialogues and the presence of brief loading screens when transitioning between each individual area. But this game bears the soul of a now-dead era of gaming. So if you are familiar with and miss those times, I don't think you'll be bothered by it. \n\nOh, there is also the PS2 legacy of locked 30 fps. But come on, are you really going to dwell on that? \n\nThe conclusion? 999/10!

Os gr\u00e1ficos ficaram ainda mais lindo em 1080p, e h\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m suporte para mouse e teclado para quem quiser.\n\nRecomendo este jogo principalmente para quem for f\u00e3 de Zelda e procura um t\u00edtulo a altura da franquia da Nintendo. Posso dizer tranquilamente como f\u00e3 de Zelda, que Okami supera f\u00e1cil alguns dos jogos da s\u00e9rie de Link.

Voc\u00ea controla Amaterasu, a deusa do Sol que vem para Terra em forma de lobo, afim de restaurar a natureza e acabar com as trevas que tomaram o mundo.

N\u00e3o \u00e9 algo que chega a atrapalhar a experi\u00eancia, visto que ele foi pensado para ser assim l\u00e1 em 2006. \nUm \u00fanico pequeno detalhe que me deixou realmente triste foi o fato de terem trocado a m\u00fasica dos cr\u00e9ditos, n\u00e3o sei se foi por algum motivo de direitos autorais, s\u00f3 sei que ela realmente fez, para mim, uma falta danada na conclus\u00e3o do jogo.\n\nE \u00e9 isso, pra quem nunca jogou,  fa\u00e7a favor a si mesmo e jogue esta obra prima.

any nostalgia about this. I've played for around 13 hours and have completed the first part of the game, so I feel now's a good point to leave a review. From what I'm reading I may still have dozens of hours of story left, although unless the game really mixes things up all of a sudden (which I very much doubt), I'm unlikely to persist until the end, as I'm starting to feel like I've probably seen most things it has to offer\n\nFirst off, be aware this game has some of the most annoying design decisions ever:\n\n1. It basically resents the player actually trying to just play it for any length of time, and constantly interrupts the flow of the game every few minutes with super-patronizing hints, cut-scenes and/or exposition. It starts with a horrible 30 minutes intro and continues the \"tell-don't-show\" theme throughout. I regularly find myself yelling \"Just let me play!\" at the monitor when it yet again yanks control away from me for  dialogue, item descriptions, or \"Captain Obvious\" style objective information / puzzle hints by the sidekick, none of which I ask it for.\n\n2. The game has no difficulty setting, and is basically permanently on \"very easy\" mode - there is little challenge in even the boss battles. Even though it's innovative, combat can become somewhat repetitive and after a while and I've found myself sometimes even avoiding optional encounters because of this. More than once has the game introduced some new enemy with a bombastic cut-scene, making out they'd be this powerful and challenging super-villain, only for me to quickly defeat them, literally without them even getting one move in.\n\n3. The voice acting consists of the most horrible munbling you can imagine. There is no voice acting, the characters just gurgle and grumble to simulate speaking. This is incredibly grating and even worse when done in a high pitch, like the voice used by your side-kick.\n\n4. Different menus and screens have different keys to navigate. Some insist on you using \"Backspace\" to exit, some let you use escape, none have mouse support.

[PC]\n\nAm 12. Dezember 2017 ver\u00f6ffentlichte Capcom das HD-Remake zum Action-Adventure Okami. Doch kann das neue HD-Remake \u00fcberzeugen? Finden wir es heraus und somit Willkommen zum Test von Okami HD!\n\nDas Action-Adventure wurde schon im Jahr 2006 f\u00fcr die PlayStation 2 ver\u00f6ffentlicht und erschien bis jetzt auch schon fast f\u00fcr jede andere Konsole. Nun aber gibt es Okami auch endlich f\u00fcr den PC als HD-Remake und somit kommen wir nun erst mal zur Geschichte.\n\nStory:\nDie Story d\u00fcrfte zwar schon jeden bekannt sein, trotzdem hier eine kleine Zusammenfassung. In Okami spielen wir als Amaterasu, die japanische Sonneng\u00f6ttin, die die Gestalt eines legend\u00e4ren wei\u00dfen Wolfs angenommen hat, um einen achtk\u00f6pfigen D\u00e4monen zu besiegen. Dieser D\u00e4mon hat dazu haupts\u00e4chlich beigetragen, dass der Ort \"Nippon\" zu einer verfallenen \u00d6dnis geworden ist. Die Geschichte rund um den wei\u00dfen Wolf wurde sehr gut in Szene gesetzt und kann wirklich \u00fcberzeugen. Auch wenn der Titel schon einige Jahre auf den Buckel hat, m\u00f6chte man sich immer wieder in diese wundersch\u00f6ne Geschichte verlieren. Somit haben die Entwickler um Punkt \"Story\" schon damals ganze Arbeit geleistet, doch was hat sich bei dem HD-Remake ge\u00e4ndert? Somit kommen wir nun zum Punkt \"Grafik\". \n\nGrafik:\nDie Grafik von Okami HD ist wirklich beeindruckend und die Tuschmalereien kamen noch nie so gut r\u00fcber wie in diesem HD-Remake. Und mit der passenden PC-Hardware gibt es das Meisterwerk sogar in wundersch\u00f6ner 4K-Grafik. Im Punkt \"Grafik\" wirkt der Titel einfach zeitlos und l\u00e4sst sich immer wieder gerne erleben. In der Testphase kamen keine Bugs bzw. Grafikfehler vor, somit ist der Titel schon jetzt ein wirkliches Highlight zum kleinen Preis. Des Weiteren ist das HD-Remake wahlweise im klassischen 4:3- oder im 16:9-Format spielbar und es gibt wieder die Ladebildschirm-Minispiele, welche leider in der Wii- und PlayStation 3-Version fehlten. Somit kann der Titel im Punkt \"Grafik\" wirklich voll uns ganz Punkten, und auch wenn der Titel schon 2006 erschien, hat Okami nichts von seinem damaligen Charme verloren. Und nun geht es auch zum n\u00e4chsten Punkt dem Gameplay. \n\nGameplay:\nIm Punkt \"Gameplay\" setzt der Titel auf eine sehr gute spielerische Vielfalt. Als legend\u00e4rer wei\u00dfer Wolf verf\u00fcgen wir n\u00e4mlich \u00fcber zwei unterschiedliche Waffentypen, um eine Vielzahl von d\u00e4monischen Gegnern zuvernichten. Die Pinseltechniken, die wir w\u00e4hrend des Spielverlaufs erlernen, sind auch eines der Highlights des Titels. Im Punkt \"Gameplay\" kann der Titel auch wie damals immer noch voll und ganz \u00fcberzeugen, die Missionen wirken sch\u00f6n gestaltet und Ingesamt setzte sich das Gameplay aus allerlei kleinen Highlights zusammen. Hier kann der Titel \u00fcberzeugen und langweilig bzw. eint\u00f6nig wird das Gameplay zu keiner Zeit und bei der PC-Steuerung gibt es keine Komplikationen. Und nun kommen wir auch schon zum Sound des HD-Remakes. \n\nSound:\nHier im Punkt \"Sound\" bietet der Titel eine wirklich stimmungsvolle Soundkulisse, welche immer perfekt zum Spielgeschehen passt. Sprachausgaben gibt es leider nicht wirklich und die Oberfl\u00e4che wird in vielen Sprachen \u00fcbermittelt. Alle Soundeffekte wurden sehr gut in das innovative Gameplay eingebaut und k\u00f6nnen auch wirklich zu jeder Zeit \u00fcberzeugen. Hier gibt es wirklich nichts zu bem\u00e4ngeln und die Entwickler haben beim HD-Remake alles richtig gemacht.\n\nFazit:\nDas HD-Remake von Okami sollte sich wirklich niemand entgehen lassen. Auch wenn der Titel schon 2006 f\u00fcr die PlayStation 2 ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde, ist der Titel kein Jahr \u00e4lter geworden und wirkt wie eine sehr sch\u00f6n gestaltete Spielperle. Die Geschichte rund um den wei\u00dfen legend\u00e4ren Wolf wird sehr sch\u00f6n erz\u00e4hlt und das Gameplay hat nichts von seinem damaligen Charme verloren. Des Weiteren kann die Grafik mit ihrem eigenen Stil sehr gut punkten. Wie schon erw\u00e4hnt, wer Okami nicht kennen sollte, darf sich diesen Titel zum kleinen Preis nicht entgehen lassen. Und wir k\u00f6nnen nur hoffen, dass das Sequel \u014ckamiden es vielleicht auch irgendwann auf die Konsole bzw. PC schaffen wird. \n\nPUNKTE! 09/10  \"A REALLY GRAPHIC MASTERPIECE!\"\n\nhttps://youtu.be/mcMjcosxIeA", "timestamp_created": 1515362806, "timestamp_updated": 1515362806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39165200": {"recommendationid": "39165200", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128825722", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1313, "last_played": 1515433363}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been hearing about this game for a while, but never really looked into it.

For real.  However, it's not a very good one, as Okami is the least commercially successful winner of a game of the year award (2006) in gaming history.  To call this an underappreciated classic is an understatement.  However, as part of the problem, I've never played this game until recently.  When this game came out for Steam, I decided to give this HD re-release a shot.  What a game.  Why the hell didn't I play this sooner?\n\nThe player controls Amaterasu, the Shinto goddess of the sun in the form of a wolf.  With the help of Issun, a wandering artist, Amaterasu runs around Nippon gathering up all the abilities she lost from before in order to save Nippon from evil.  Along the way, Amaterasu befriends allies and battles enemies to achieve this goal.  That's really all I care to speak about the story, due to potential spoilers and the sheer length of the game.  Okami took me 40 hours to beat, and that's without grinding for any particular item or anything.  It simply has an epic tale that is a joy to experience.\n\nAt first play, it is impossible for the player to not notice the unique graphics Okami uses.  I firmly believe that cel-shaded games benefit most from these HD remakes, and Okami takes almost full advantage.  The watercolor vibe really does give this game a ton of character, and it being in HD helps keep its graphics looking great even in 2018.  Every single level has immense character due to this, from the foliage of the trees to the evil emanating from enemies.  At some points, seeing the sky blue colors contrast with the sunset red is simply awe-inspiring.  Okami is truly a beautiful game.\n\nHowever, there is one issue that ties in with the graphics -- this game is 30fps in gameplay (60fps in menus).  This was an initial problem for me, as I play first-person shooters in 144+fps, so my eyes had to adjust to the blur.  This is probably moreso a problem for PC Master Race gamers, who expect more out of any game today.  However, being that Okami was originally a PS2 title, the framerate is tied in with its physics and gameplay.  I'd rather have a fun game to play at 30fps than a broken game at higher framerates, and as my eyes adjusted, this became a non-issue.\n\nThe only other thing about Okami is that, well, it's incredibly easy.  I promise I say this without bragging, but I didn't come close to dying once during the 40 hour playthrough.  However, in an age where people claim things like, \"Crash Bandicoot is the Dark Souls of platformers,\" maybe its lack of difficulty isn't the worst thing in the world.  Should the player want a challenge, there are no other difficulty levels, but Okami enthusiasts told me its de-facto \"hard mode\" is playing without upgrades.  Its difficulty could also be interpreted as child-friendly, too, for parents looking for a gift for their kid to play.  Ultimately, this is a non-problem.\n\nThat's because Okami is just so much fun to play.  It is incredibly charming, with memorable characters, an epic story, and an engaging adventure.  Its combat is so simple, but it works so well.  Amaterasu's main ability is her Celestial Brush, which allows her to use a multitude of abilities against enemies while attacking.  This is done very well both with a controller or with a mouse and keyboard.  The exchange between painting your enemies to death while attacking them is seamless and also satisfying.  This style of gameplay help make Okami's boss battles clever and fun to fight.  The brush abilities extend to out of combat, too, where they're used to complete puzzles and progress to new areas in the game.  These aspects all make Okami a rewarding and satisfying game to play, despite its lack of difficulty.\n\nThe sound deserves a special mention, too.  The music is wonderful.  Okami is a very chill game to play, and its music fits within the mood of the world Okami creates, whatever the situation.  Thematically, it showcases a style of traditional Japanese music that matches the Shinto backstory it tells, and really helps immerse the player into the story or the battle.  The sound effects are almost as vibrant as the graphics themselves.  The \"dialogue\" comes from the school of Banjo-Kazooie, and its Sims-ish speech only lends to the game's charm, in my opinion.  The sound this game delivers is on the same level as every other aspect of it -- excellence.\n\nHowever, Okami's brilliance is its ability to tie all of its excellent parts together into one amazing package.  Its gameplay gimmick ties in with Okami's graphics itself, which dovetails perfectly with its music, which is further buttressed by its story, which showcases the charming characters, and so on.  All these aspects complement each other so well, it makes Okami the brilliant game that it is.  And while this game wasn't fully appreciated in the past, I'm glad that we get a second chance to experience playing it in 2018 and beyond.  It would be a shame to continually miss out.\n\nOkami is a masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1515180875, "timestamp_updated": 1515182036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.828134", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39093935": {"recommendationid": "39093935", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102180532", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 3079, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515178730}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5176\u5b9e\u5462\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u662f\u6709\u7eed\u4f5c\u7684\uff0c\u7eed\u4f5c\u662f\u4efb\u5929\u5802nds\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u300a\u5927\u795e\u4f20-\u5c0f\u5c0f\u7684\u592a\u9633\u300b\uff0c\u4e3b\u89d2\u662f\u5927\u795e\u5929\u7167\u7684\u513f\u5b50\u5c0f\u7167\uff0cPC\u597d\u50cf\u80fd\u591f\u6a21\u62df\u5427,\u4e0d\u8bf4\u4e86\u53bb\u73a93ds\u53bb\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1515180283, "timestamp_updated": 1515180598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39093912": {"recommendationid": "39093912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073835584", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514333685}, "language": "french", "review": "J'en attendai beaucoup de ce jeu et je suis malheureusement bien d\u00e9cu, je m'attendai a des graphismes bien supp\u00e9rieurs, par rapport a ce qui \u00e9tait annonc\u00e9, et le gameplay qui rendait le jeu si agr\u00e9able et fluide sur ps2, est sur pc compl\u00e9tement injouable, rien n'est intuitif, il faut constamment faire des vas et viens sur le pad.\n\nremboursement demand\u00e9", "timestamp_created": 1515180248, "timestamp_updated": 1515180248, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.398551", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39090621": {"recommendationid": "39090621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159867899", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515173289}, "language": "english", "review": "if you like videogames,you have to buy and play it!\n\nOne of the the best games ever made.", "timestamp_created": 1515173421, "timestamp_updated": 1515173770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39089464": {"recommendationid": "39089464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132617612", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1516081092}, "language": "english", "review": "There's no question the game is awesome and beautiful, it was so even on PS2, the original platform.

[/h1]\n\nThis is my third time doing a full playthrough of this incredibly unique game - first on PS2, second on the Wii, now on PC. \n\n[b] Why I think it deserves the accolades [/b]:\n\n+ [b] Sound [/b]: The music is nothing short of brilliant; the compositions span the whole spectrum of eerily haunting to whimsically playful, from morose longing to exuberant joy whilst remaining quintissentially Japanese in style throughout. \n\n+ [b] Graphics [/b]: The art style is unique and detailed - you can stop playing the game and admire the scenic views at almost any point. The cell shading emulates a Japanese bamboo painting style, it's really effective, it's like playing a moving painting. \n\n+ [b] Story [/b]: Equally expressive as the music, you'll be taken through a wild array of situations many of which are wholly unexpected and hilariously bizarre. To put the story simply; you are a god that has lost its power and needs to rejuvenate the once bustling land of medieval rural Nippon. You'll meet animals, people, spirits and monsters, dealing with their problems or malevolence helps restore the vitality of the myriad locations you will encounter, FeelsGoodMan\n\n+ [b] Gameplay [/b]: Comparisons to Zelda are justified; there is close combat, there are large scale puzzles, there are upgradable items and buffs, but none of these feel ripped off from the Zelda series - Okami forges its own path and it feels more seamless than pre-BOTW Zelda games. Dungeons are an extension of the world rather than something you've been locked in until you beat the boss. The difficulty is just about right too, there's plenty of play styles to be utlized in bouts and the brush techniques and various weapons cater to this. That being said, once you get into your groove most fights - that aren't a boss - become easier but still rewarding and fun because the quicker and more efficiently you win a fight the better the cash prize. \n\nLength-wise this game could last you 50 hours easily for a thorough first-time playthrough. I sped through this time finishing in less that 30 hours, even though it was my 3rd time playing I still thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nA minor note goes to performance: no graphical/sound/framerate errors at all throughout my playthrough. Also, [i] the mouse and keyboard support is great. [/i]\n\n[b] Criticisms of the port [/b]:\n\n- [b] Resolution/Framerate [/b]: AMD's super resolution and NVIDIA's equivalent cannot be used for this game it seems, which is annoying as it's great to play old games with the res put up to 4k and see just how good older games can stand the test of time - sadly, Okami is locked to your screen's native res. or below. It's also locked to 30fps and due to the engine's fundamentals will most likely never change from this in the future - though it's always smooth. As someone that is a big 60fps advocate I have to say the 30fps cap didn't hinder my playthrough anywhere near as much as I thought it would.\n\nHowever I HIGHLY recommend installing Steam user Kaldaien's Special K mod that allows you to turn off Grain and Bloom easily which makes the game look a whole lot cleaner and 'HD' - apparently he's working on 60fps too...\n\n- [b] Controls and camera angles [/b] - Occasionally the game struggles to register where your celestial  brush is positioned and even though you think you may have done the brush work right you'll find out you haven't. The camera angles and horizontal movement of the camera can also be frustrating as you will sometimes lose track of where your enemies are or even where your character is, coupled with the fact that you cannot change the horizontal camera speed with the controller makes for some clunky/aggrevating moments - fortunately this problem isn't prevalent. \n\n- [b] Controller [/b] - At first I thought my wireless Xbox 360 controller wasn't supported - it turns out the game is just picky, I needed to turn my controller on before I even opened up Steam to make sure Okami realized the controller was there. After that it works flawlessly and you can switch to KB&M seamlessly too.\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]: If you like rich, expansive storytelling, Japanese folklore, ellaborate but whistlable oriental music, Zelda-style RPG elements, and addictive gameplay then Okami would be a crime to pass up - BUY IT and hopefully Capcom will force Clover Studios to be reborn to make another Okami masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1515153139, "timestamp_updated": 1515338108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39080491": {"recommendationid": "39080491", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164920632", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514821261}, "language": "english", "review": "too hard with control camera plz fix that soon!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1515151203, "timestamp_updated": 1515151203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39078556": {"recommendationid": "39078556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064226081", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 182, "last_played": 1515360641}, "language": "english", "review": "discovered the game a long time ago and then i cried once i realised there's no pc version.\nnow i cried again, but out of  happiness\nyou're a cool ass wolf that gets to beat bad guys and go bork 24/7?\n10/10\nalso i hate issun", "timestamp_created": 1515145716, "timestamp_updated": 1515192329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468750", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39077919": {"recommendationid": "39077919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157630385", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513736353}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, definitely one of the top games overall for me.\nPlayed it about 7 years ago or so, on PS2 and Wii and absolutely loved it, and the experience stuck with me until now, still really vivid in memory.\n\nGreat sound tracks, beautiful art, humorous dialogues, and top of everything, fantastic storytelling.\n", "timestamp_created": 1515143759, "timestamp_updated": 1515143759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500960", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39077631": {"recommendationid": "39077631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113721480", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 69, "last_played": 1514945356}, "language": "english", "review": "To put it simply, get this game if you love any of the following: Dogs or Wolves, Japanese Folklore and Legends, Fun Puzzles based on powers, Collectables that make you rage, Hard Races, and Beads... lots and lots of beads.

mantiene interesante.\n\n\n[h1] Sinopsis breve: [/h1]\n\nLuego de 100 a\u00f1os de tranquilidad, el mal vuelve y hay que detenerlo, para eso vamos a controlar a Amaterasu, diosa del sol encarnada en un lobo acompa\u00f1ada de Issun (un pintor de reducido tama\u00f1o).\n\n\n[h1] Peculiaridad:  [/h1] \n\nEste juego tiene una mec\u00e1nica muy interesante, que es el poder pintar, y si pintamos diferentes figuras o hacemos determinados s\u00edmbolos podemos interactuar con el escenario y personajes, ej: al hacer una l\u00ednea podemos cortar lo que haya detr\u00e1s de ella.\nEsto lo vamos a pasar usando, para explorar el mapa y en combate, en esto, nos hace usar una t\u00e9cnica distinta dependiendo del enemigo, pero tambi\u00e9n podemos combatir normalmente usando armas/artefactos.\n\n\n[h1] Pros:  [/h1] \n\n[list]\n    [*]Muy buena banda sonora.\n    [*]Excelente estilo art\u00edstico.\n    [*]Su mec\u00e1nica es muy creativa y buena.\n    [*]La historia es bastante buena.\n    [*]Cuando parece que la historia se va a acabar, te meten 20 horas mas de juego.\n    [*]Variedad de t\u00e9cnicas con el pincel.\n    [*]Debido a que obtenemos las diferentes t\u00e9cnicas del pincel en distintas partes de la historia, nos hace volver a mapas/niveles anteriores para descubrir nuevos lugares y aprender cosas nuevas.\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*]Hay paredes invisibles donde no deber\u00edan estar y hacen dar vueltas innecesarias.\n    [*]Algunos di\u00e1logos podr\u00edan no estar y no cambiar\u00edan nada, porque simplemente repiten lo que ya se dijo.\n    [*]Alg\u00fan jefe que otro es reciclado.\n    [*]No hay mucha dificultad, lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil son los desaf\u00edos de oleadas de monstruos que es casi al final del juego y opcional, por lo que se puede saltear.\n    [*]-En mi caso jugu\u00e9 con teclado y mouse, pero hay bastante gente con problemas al usar joysticks/mandos.\n[/list]\n   \n\n[h1] Fuera de pros y contras: [/h1]\n\n(Cosas que no veo como buenas o malas)\n[list]\n    [*]No est\u00e1 en espa\u00f1ol.\n    [*]Los personajes no hablan en alg\u00fan idioma conocido, sino que hacen un ruidito y quiz\u00e1s a alguien le resulte molesto.\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1] Detalles de esta versi\u00f3n HD:  [/h1] \n\n[list]\n    [*]Se pueden saltear pr\u00e1cticamente todos los di\u00e1logos y escenas con el F1.\n    [*]Si no se quieren saltear los di\u00e1logos, se pueden acelerar con Click izquierdo y si se quieren pasar r\u00e1pido con click derecho.\n    [*]Soporte 4k\n    [*]Completamente compatible con teclado+mouse, yo no tuve ning\u00fan problema de configuraci\u00f3n y adem\u00e1s, gracias a su mec\u00e1nica lo hace perfecto para ser jugado as\u00ed, ya que nos da mucha m\u00e1s precisi\u00f3n para pintar.\n    [*]Est\u00e1 capado a 30fps, pero la verdad no molesta para nada.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1515109375, "timestamp_updated": 1515109892,

OKAMI is a story-driven adventure game very similar to The Legend of Zelda. As a long-time OKAMI fan I always loved the deep and enthralling story, but sadly could never get the hang of the gameplay with the Wii controls. That being said, this HD rerelease controls like a dream. I have sunk about 50 hours into the game thus far and mastered the controls within the first 2. Another thing that this game has to make it stand out is the beautiful and stylistic art direction of the game. Typically I don't care for the graphical improvements that remasters offer, but the jump from 480p to 1080p HD suits OKAMI so nicely and feels that this is the way the devs intended the game to be viewed. I seriously can't praise OKAMI enough, with the main story being split into 3 arcs, many sidequests that make you care for the characters, and hundreds of collectables to obtain, you have a long haul ahead of you.

Sure, it doesn't support 60 FPS, but personally, I just got used to it after the 30 FPS limit after a while since I didn't know it any other way from the Wii version. \nSo, if you have some time to spare and don't mind the 30 FPS too much, just buy this absolute gem of a game.

I own this game for Wii.  I own this game for PS3.  And now I own it for PC.\n\nHaving beaten this game at least 2 or three times on multiple consoles, I can confidently say this is an excellent port.\n\nIn Okami, you play as an incarnation of the sun goddess Amaterasu (Ammy for short) trying to save the world from darkness and evil.  Having woken up from a hundred year-long absence, Ammy is now much weaker compared to 100 years ago, and must find the other gods in order to regain her strength and abilities to face the trials ahead.\n\nThese abilities primarily consist of Celestial Brush techniques, which allow you to paint designs that can slash like a sword, create fire from nothing, or change night into day (she [b] is [/b] the sun goddess, after all).  New abilities, much like new items in Legend of Zelda games, will also allow you to make your way further in the world, unlocking new areas and a plethora of hidden secrets.\n\nGameplay is fun, as long as you're not looking for highly complex combo systems.  For those that don't much care for combat, a lot of it is optional, and combat has no effect on improving Ammy's stats.\n\nOkami controls very nicely, with keyboard + mouse controls as good as a playstation controller (better for those more comfortable with a keyboard than a controller).  Mouse controls for the paintbrush are probably the best of all systems, as it takes a bit of practice to master using an analog stick or the Wiimote.  The mouse, simply put, feels more natural.  I played using a keyboard so I cannot attest to how well PC Okami plays using a controller.\n\nWhile I don't consider graphics to be a deal-breaker, it's still nice to have something pretty to look at.  And Okami is [b] gorgeous [/b] .  I don't just mean for an eleven year-old game; I mean just in general.  Vibrant colors and an art style reminiscent of a Japanese painting mean that Okami ages much more gracefully than most games (though the first area can be a little hard on the eyes and, visually, is one of my least favorite areas).  If you know what to look for, you can easily see places where the game shows its age, but overall, the game still looks beautiful.\n\nWhile I feel I've spent too many words on this review already, I [b] have [/b] to mention the soundtrack.  Always appropriate to the mood of the scene (or very deliberately not), many tracks are just plain beautiful, with the exceptions generally being deliberately silly or fun.  The one great shame is that the original credits song is (I hear, being near the end but not yet having beaten PC Okami as of the writing of this review) is absent, as it has been from every port of the game.\nEDIT:  Having completed Okami, I can confirm that, sadly, the original credits song has been replaced by something else.\n\nSome minor issues I had that were no more than mild annoyances:\n[olist]\n[*] Occasionally, when moving, the canvas (mapped to ctrl) would come up while I was only pressing the movement keys.  I haven't yet figured out why.\n[*] In the fishing minigame, the keys used to yank fish out of the water are sometimes the same ones used to reel them in, which, when it happened, would result in me yanking the fish out when I wasn't ready to.  For those not familiar with the minigame, you need to bring up the canvas using ctrl within a second or two after yanking it out of the water or else the fish will fall back in and you have to repeat the reeling process.  Sometimes (not always) I would be caught by surprise enough that I missed that window.\n[*] My computer is not that great, so I could, for the mosts part, only run Okami on \"medium\" graphics or else face significant lag and cutscenes with unsynched audio and visuals, and for one boss battle had to drop the graphics to \"low.\"  Even playing on \"low,\" though, the game is still gorgeous.\n[/olist]\n\nAnd for veterans of the PS2 version:  [b] the loading screen minigames are back! [/b]\n\nOverall, Okami is excellent.  If you like Legend of Zelda, games that look like you're playing a painting, games that have a painting mechanic, or some old fashioned, albeit simple, demon-bashing, I think you'll like this game.", "timestamp_created": 1514891963, "timestamp_updated": 1515311723, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 120, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.886413", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38967965": {"recommendationid": "38967965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101806551", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 117, "last_played": 1515328728}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1514888021, "timestamp_updated": 1514888021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38966628": {"recommendationid": "38966628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043574915", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 329, "last_played": 1516172380}, "language": "english", "review": "Even today I still love this game to death.

Zu sch\u00f6n und herzergreifend ist einfach die Geschichte, um sie nach einem Mal durchspielen schon beiseite zu legen. Umso mehr freute ich mich auf die \"Neuauflage\" f\u00fcr den PC. Es ist noch genauso sch\u00f6n und mitrei\u00dfend wie fr\u00fcher, und ich kann auch heute noch mit gutem Gewissen jedem dieses Game nur an's Herz legen. Eines der tollsten Spiele die ich je gezockt habe.\n\nAllerdings muss ich einen kleinen Kritikpunkt an die Deutsche Fassung niederschreiben. Sie \u00e4ndert nichts daran, dass das Ende des Games mich jedes Mal mit einer Ehrfurcht erf\u00fcllt das ich am liebsten vor lauter R\u00fchrseligkeit anfangen m\u00f6chte zu heulen, aber gerade weil mir das Spiel am Herzen liegt muss ich es \u00e4u\u00dfern.\n\nSchon damals auf der PS sind mir der ein oder andere Schreibfehler aufgefallen. Es ist nat\u00fcrlich nicht schlimm wenn sich _mal_ ein kleiner Fehler hineinschleicht. Dennoch verliert ein Game f\u00fcr mich pers\u00f6nlich ein klein wenig an Seriosit\u00e4t wenn dies eintritt. Aber in der deutschen Fassung von Okami sind mir doch so einige, auch fragw\u00fcrdige Schreibweisen aufgefallen. An zwei Stellen fehlen mitten im Satz sogar ganze W\u00f6rter. Dar\u00fcber kann man ja noch gerade so mit einem zugekniffenden Auge hinweg sehen, aber was mich wirklich ganz besonders auf die Palme bringt ist: Wenn man sich daf\u00fcr entscheidet die Anreden \"Euch\" und \"Ihr\" zu verwenden, dann muss das verdammich noch eins, auch gro\u00dfgeschrieben werden.. Kleingeschrieben haben die Worte eine ganz andere Bedeutung. Und eine K\u00f6nigin wird nun einmal in diesem Kontext mit \"Euch\", gro\u00dfgeschrieben,  angesprochen. Ich finde es wirklich sehr schade, dass bei der \u00dcbersetzung niemand darauf geachtet hat. Denn wissen sollte man das eigentlich schon. Sorry, nennt mich gern 'Grammar Nazi' aber solche Fehler d\u00fcrfen nicht passieren.\nEin Game sollte in meinen Augen schon auf eine korrekte Schreibweise achten, auch weil viele junge Menschen die es vielleicht nicht besser wissen wom\u00f6glich annehmen, dass es so richtig ist. \n\nEine letzte Sache noch. Issun ist zweifelsohne ein Charakter der mit seiner flappsigen Redensart so manche Situation auflockert und belustigt. Aber dieses st\u00e4ndige \"Was zur H\u00f6lle\".. Nachdem mir auffiel wie oft er das sagt, nagt es seitdem doch reichlich an meinen Nerven. Die Deutsche Sprache h\u00e4tte da weit mehr zu bieten als das ewige \"Was zur H\u00f6lle hier\" und \"Was zur H\u00f6lle da\". Auf Anhieb w\u00fcrden mir da \"Ach du schei\u00dfe\" \"Meine Fresse!\" \"Heiliger Bimbam!\" und \"Ach du meine G\u00fcte\" einfallen, als immer nur diese H\u00f6llekacke da. Und ich denke wenn man Worte wie \"fuchsk\u00f6pfige Schlampe\" durchgehen lassen kann, dann sehe ich keinen Grund die anderen Fl\u00fcche auszugrenzen lol\n\u00c4ndern tut diese Kritik auch nichts mehr an dem Game, aber es ist schon schade das die Kreativit\u00e4t da ein wenig gelitten hat. Issun kann zig anz\u00fcgliche, zweideutige Bemerkungen hinaushauen, aber bei einer Reaktion auf etwas erschreckendes, f\u00e4llt ihm nur was zur H\u00f6lle ein.\nNaja beim zweiten Durchlauf skippe ich die Dialoge sowieso aber jetzt der Nostalgie halber lese ich sie mir ganz gerne mal wieder durch. Da  f\u00e4llt es dann schon reichlich auf.. xD\n\nABER NUN DENN.\nLanger Rede und kein Sinn, davon abgesehen \u00e4ndert das wie gesagt nichts daran, dass dieses Game vor sch\u00f6nen Momenten und \u00dcberraschungen nur so \u00fcberquillt und sicherlich jeder seinen Spa\u00df damit haben kann!", "timestamp_created": 1514638102, "timestamp_updated": 1515330938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.640816", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38857177": {"recommendationid": "38857177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198383728907", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 82, "last_played": 1515804916}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u503c\u5f97\u4e00\u73a9\u518d\u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1514635232, "timestamp_updated": 1514635232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38852922": {"recommendationid": "38852922", "author": {"steamid": "76561198305592875", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513952703}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u5f53\u7136\u6ca1\u7684\u8bf4\uff0c\u867d\u8bf4\u662f\u91cd\u5236\u7248\uff0c\u653e\u5230\u5982\u4eca\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u80fd\u505a\u5230\u5982\u6b64\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u3002\n\u5e0c\u671b\u52a0\u5165\u4e2d\u6587\u5427\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u672c\u8eab\u6587\u5b57\u91cf\u633a\u5927\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u6253\u6c49\u5316\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u8bdd\uff08\u6211\uff1f\uff09\u6839\u672c\u73a9\u4e0d\u4e0b\u53bb\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u6c49\u5316\u8865\u4e01\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u5e76\u4e0d\u9ad8\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u5730\u65b9\u8fd8\u4e0d\u662f\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5e0c\u671b\u5b98\u65b9\u80fd\u5c3d\u5feb\u63a8\u51fa\u4e2d\u6587\u652f\u6301\u5427\u3002Respect Kamiya Hideki.

The game just stutters constantly. I understand its 30 fps, and while I did not like that(Many other games have made a successful jump from 30 to 60 fps in that era), I could live with it if the stuttering wasn't every 30 seconds or so.(This is not normal btw. I have seen videos with the game not having this issue) I've ran benchmarking tests and stress tests since and nothing negative popped up on my machine. All drivers up to date. All other games run fine, all much more visually demanding than this. For sure strange.\n\nRefunded due to the issues. Sad about it really, as I hear such great things about Okami and I wanted to experience it for the first time. However if it plays like this, I would pass on this. Hopefully your luck is different as I hear it is a great game.\n\nEdit: Since people cannot seem to read. I know the game was made at 30 fps. I am not speaking badly on that choice anyways. My review is solely based on the fact it did not run like it should of on my machine. When you pay for a game you expect it to work, if it doesn't you bring the game back. Simple as that. There's not much to Okami's visual settings to change...so obviously I tried that before the review.\n\nUnreal that I have people responding to this review like they are Dr. Phil saying I am addicted to new games lmao. Nah man, just addicted to games that run as they should. if a 30 fps game is breaking 30 fps and stuttering, it's not 30 fps.\n\nEdit #2: Only other game I've ever had stuttering issues with was assassin's creed origins, which lets face it, is a stutter fest due to uplay, not the game itself. So again, never had a stuttering issue besides from this game. Re bought it and tried it again hoping the comments were right, nope. Still a mess. Be wary and don't listen to steam comments.

Definitely in my top games of 2017. What a way to close a year!\n\nBear in mind this is the first time I've played through the game, it caught my attention when it released so I decided to give it a try.\n\n-------\n\n+ AMAZING soundtrack. Unique songs/pieces for almost every segment of the game. It's a wonder to the ears!\n+ Beautifully crafted story throughout the entire game. It's extremely rewarding once you get deep into the game. Lots of japanese mythology.\n+ The characters are likeable, especially the 'lil guy who helps & goes around with you throughout the game.\n+ Art style is just pretty to look at, even for a game from 2006.\n+ Solid & Unique combat. There's several weapons to find and several combos you can try with each. You can also attack enemies with \"brush tecniques\" which allow you to cut, burn, freeze, electrocute, and even more to enemies!\n+ Unique levels. No level's the same and this brings uniqueness to every dungeon you go through.\n+ Upgrade system is magnificent. You earn \"Praise\" by restoring nature to its old self, feeding animals, helping people, and doing quests. \n+ Lengthy game. Took more than 35 hours to reach the final boss. Didn't even 100% the game either. \n+ You're the goddess of the sun, what else more do you want? You get called doggie a lot, too!\n~ Not so difficult. Game does have a gradual increase in difficult when you progress, though.\n- Had problems with alt-tabbing out of the game, for some reason whenever I do that, the game enters Windowed mode and cannot be reset back to fullscreen unless you exit the game. Hopefully this gets a fix sometime in the future.\n\n-------\n\nI heard that a lot of people are complaining because of the 30fps lock. If you're a simple person like myself and don't mind the 30fps this game is definitely a must try. I don't even have a great setup and it ran smoothly in Medium graphics. I also read some reviews complaining about controller inputs. Use Big Screen Mode for that and it should run completely fine!

First off, this game took heavy influence from Zelda, and most people who enjoy the diverse overworld with interesting dungeons and fun new mechanics unlocked through gameplay should enjoy this game as well. Granted, the dungeons are far from Zelda quality, often being very linear and quite easy puzzlewise. The combat is fun, but also pretty easy.  The controls are smooth and are mapped pretty well to mouse and keyboard, and the brush mechanic feels designed to be used with a mouse.\n\nWhere this game truly shone for me, however, was its story.

The issue at first was that pressing x or o while the game loads does not activate the controller. Instead, one must press start. Seems odd but not a dealbreaker.\n\nAs for the game itself, its most certainly a fun game but i do have my gripes. Although my play hours seem low ive played for much longer in offline mode for personal circumstances. I have yet to complete the game but i think ive played enough this far to make a fair judgement.\n\nFirst and foremost, the game has TONS of collectibles. You'll constantly find yourself backtracking to collect praise or stray beads after collecting a new brush technique. You have to feed animals, rejuvenate trees, and much more in order to collect praise, which you can call the equivalent to \"exp\" of sorts used to upgrade a trait of your choice. Praise can also be acquired from story progression for that matter. The issue is how ever that the amount you get for each one is rather small, counterbalanced by the sheer number of collectible praise. At some point it becomes a bit of a chore that takes away from being able to enjoy the main game. Of course you can just do any praise collecting thats happens to be in your path but why gimp yourself for the lategame? At the very least the game has lists of sorts for some of these collectibles, but not all of them, such as for rejuvenating clovers.\n\nThe game is also bogged a bit more by constant hand holding. Occasionally some hand holding is needed. For example, when your given the crescent brush technique to make it night time, youre supposed to make a simple curved line from top to bottom. I kept making a full backwards c from bottom to top, frustrated until the game pointed out exactly how to make the proper stroke. Japanese stroke order is serious business. Beyond that however youre constantly given text explaining everything even after its already obvious what solution is needed for a given circumstance. Some dialogue here and there cant be sped up, and constant story dialogue that tends to be needlessly long is peppered through out the game. I feel the game could be trimmed about a quarter of the total play time just by removing needless text and dialogue.\n\nThe game is also relatively easy. You'll hardly find yourself struggling against encountered enemies and bosses. Bosses tend to be slow and their gimmick as obvious as broad daylight. The game doesnt quite require the technical skill in combat as say zelda for instance. Bear in mind ive only fought 4 actual bosses thus far so perhaps its to early to say that other bosses may not require more skill, but when i havent gone below 75% of my health once the entire game the difficulty becomes questionable. Its laughable that theres a mechanic that once fully upgraded allows you to be revived up to 4 times(if i understand correctly) during a fight. I have to wonder if the team behind the game wasnt sure if they wanted a younger or older demoographic for the game during development, or if the play testers have never touched an action game once in their life.\n\nAnyways, for the modest price of the game id still reccomend picking up the game. Even for a zeldaesque game it rivals smaller and older jrpgs for completion time. Enjoy the game and take your time making your progress while you enjoy the beautiful visuals of okami.", "timestamp_created": 1514330908, "timestamp_updated": 1514529158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.406836", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38714454": {"recommendationid": "38714454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128118343", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514508192}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5927\u795e\u7684\u51b7\u996d\u6211\u5403\u4e00\u4e07\u5e74\uff0c\u4f60\u4f9d\u65e7\u8bb0\u5f97\u5c0f\u5b66\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5728\u6211\u7ed8\u753b\u8001\u5e08\u5bb6\u91cc\u7684\u4e3b\u673a\u4e0a\u73a9\u5927\u795e\u7684\u65e5\u5b50", "timestamp_created": 1514326929, "timestamp_updated": 1514326929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547804", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38714172": {"recommendationid": "38714172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072293742", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514326324}, "language": "german", "review": "PlatinumGames Lagacy (R.I.P.

Das Zeichnen mit der Maus funktioniert gut und auch der Rest der Steuerung ist f\u00fcr einen Port sehr gelungen. Einen Controller hiermit zum Laufen zu bringen fand ich allerdings eher schwierig, kommt aber sicherlich auch auf das Modell an.\n\nDas Spiel selbst ist schwierig zu beschreiben. Es ist kein Zelda-Clon, auch wenn es nat\u00fcrlich \u00c4hnlichkeiten gibt. Die Pinseltechniken funktionieren wie Waffen und Werkzeuge und werden vielf\u00e4ltig in die R\u00e4tsel eingebunden. Au\u00dferdem bietet das Spiel meiner Meinung nach genau die richtige Balance aus An-die-Hand-nehmen und Selbst-ausprobieren-lassen. Wenn man beispielsweise mehrmals an einem Minispiel scheitert, gibt das Spiel oft zus\u00e4tzliche Hinweise, um einem unter die Arme zu greifen.\n\nEinziger Kritikpunkt ist f\u00fcr mich, dass es manchmal zu Laggs kommt. Generell scheint es noch ein paar technische Probleme zu geben, da auch manche von Abst\u00fcrzen und \u00e4hnlichen Problemen berichten. Laggs - wie in meinem Fall - sind ein bisschen nervig, da es viele R\u00e4tsel gibt, bei denen Timing wichtig ist und die Pinseltechniken verfehlen ihre Wirkung, wenn der Strich nicht akkurat genug gesetzt wird. Bisher bin ich aber trotzdem gut durch das Spiel durchgekommen.\n\nNichtsdestotrotz ist Okami ein Meisterwerk. Nicht nur grafisch und akustisch, sondern auch durch seine Geschichte und die Untert\u00f6ne. Es macht einfach Spa\u00df, man kann sich stundenlang darin verlieren, R\u00e4tseln, erkunden und Sch\u00e4tze suchen und sammeln oder einfach nur die einzigartige Umgebung bewundern.", "timestamp_created": 1514292393, "timestamp_updated": 1514292393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38694191": {"recommendationid": "38694191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101575899", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514954596}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6ca1PS2\uff0c\u60f3\u4e86\u5341\u5e74\u7684\u6e38\u620f", "timestamp_created": 1514289917, "timestamp_updated": 1514289917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.686988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38693476": {"recommendationid": "38693476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195216010", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 74, "last_played": 1516199983}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u521a\u5f00\u59cb\u73a9\u6709\u70b9\u4e0d\u4e60\u60ef\uff0c\u73a9\u4e0b\u53bb\u540e\u5c31\u6c89\u8ff7\u5176\u4e2d\u4e86\u3002\u72ec\u7279\u800c\u60ca\u8273\u7684\u6c34\u58a8\u753b\u98ce\uff0c\u4f18\u79c0\u7684BGM\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u7b14\u8c03\u7cfb\u7edf\u73a9\u6cd5\u591a\u6837\u6709\u8da3\u3002\u652f\u7ebf\u4efb\u52a1\u91cc\u7684\u5c0f\u6e38\u620f\u4e5f\u5f88\u597d\u73a9\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5728\u5927\u5730\u4e0a\u5954\u8dd1\u7684\u767d\u72fc\u65a9\u5996\u9664\u9b54\u5e76\u4e14\u5e2e\u52a9\u9700\u8981\u5e2e\u52a9\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u522b\u6709\u4e00\u756a\u60c5\u8da3\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1514288394, "timestamp_updated": 1514288394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38688811": {"recommendationid": "38688811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198361005663", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515036736}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u53ea\u80fd\u7528\u60ca\u8273\u4fe9\u5b57\u5f62\u5bb9\u4e86\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1514277191, "timestamp_updated": 1514277191, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38687717": {"recommendationid": "38687717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043004249", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514272307}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games ever made, I am so happy it finally came to pc!", "timestamp_created": 1514273991, "timestamp_updated": 1514273991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38686153": {"recommendationid": "38686153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010998629", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2882, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514182907}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful, fun, interesting.

The fact that they remastered this game and the gameplay still holds up by today\u2019s standards truly says something about this game. The multifaceted combat and puzzle gameplay mechanic and the truly amazing rendition of classic Japanese folklore tales just makes this game a true gem of games. I had 100% completed this game back when I played it on the PlayStation 2 and I was impressed by the graphics then but now I\u2019m in awe at the graphical fidelity and to see the fine details of the games Sumi-e ink art style fully come to life. I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to play this game a lot since I bought it but that mostly because of some IRL stuff that have been stopping me from playing but rest assured from my experience of completing this game back when it was on the PlayStation 2 that the game itself works very well. \n\n A few things that would make this game better are such as a controller, PlayStation Controller or Xbox Controller either one works just fine but this is my personal preference so if you want to play with mouse and keyboard it will be just the same. Now another thing that would make this game a lot more meaningful is that you learn a bit of Japanese folktales such as \u201cThe tale of Princess Kaguya\u201d or the legend of \u201cYamata No Orochi\u201d. These explains things such as the relations between Orochi and Amaterasu the Sun God. With that I can assure you that you will have a good time playing this game with all its character. If you\u2019re like me and want to 100% complete this game, then it shouldn\u2019t be a full-time commitment like most modern games that try and suck all your free time and if you can\u2019t find a particular item just google for hints or guide since this is an old game and a lot of people have made guides for it.\n\n With all that in mind I genuinely recommend this game if you want an authentic one of a kind experience.

Screw that. \n\nI'll be blunt: Okami, in my opinion, is one of the few games which HAS to be in everyone's Top 10 games of all time. Period.\n\nStory: 8.0/10\n[i]The game is set in a Nippon (Japan) based on Japanese folklore and begins in one hundred years in the past. The narrator describes how the white wolf Shiranui and swordsman Nagi fought and sealed the eight-headed demon Orochi at the cave, to save Kamiki Village and Nagi's beloved maiden Nami.\n\nIn the game's present, Nagi's descendant and self-proclaimed greatest warrior, Susano, refuses to believe in Nagi's legend and frees Orochi, who escapes and curses the lands, sapping the life from Nippon. Sakuya, the wood sprite and guardian of Kamiki Village, calls forth Amaterasu, the sun goddess, known to the villagers as the reincarnation of the white wolf Shiranui, and asks her to remove the curse that covers the land. Accompanied by the artist Issun (an inch-high creature known as a Poncle), Amaterasu begins to restore the land to its normal state.[/i]\n\nSound: 9.5/10\nWith 4 CD's the soundtrack is packed with hours. If you say \"Quality over quantity\" though then jokes on you, the quality is just as good. Sadly the ending song \"Reset\" from the PS2 version is missing which really hurts.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nThe paint brush style hast been beautiful ten years ago, it still is and it'll be even in 50 years.\n\nPresentation: 9.5/10 \n+ The overworld is big. Speedrunning from the two furthest points away might take you quite a while.\n+ Super lovely characters. Dialogues with the residents are interesting to read, too.\n+ When you think the game's end is near, you'll be at the halfway point. Nice surprise factor.\n+ The final part of Okami (which still takes about 10 hours to finish) really raise the stakes.\n- The Banjo-Kazooie-like voiceover is not as pleasent in here like in most of those N64 era-games.\n \n \nGameplay: 9.5/10  \n+ Similar to the likes of Zelda, Darksiders and other action adventures\n+ A LOT of secrets and collectibles\n+++The celestial paintbrush mechanic\n- Playing it after 10 years, the camera movement could be somewhat more responsive.\n- Really easy game, almost impossible to die. There's a workaround though: Don't upgrade your equipment/status plus refrain from using items and you'll be up to a challenge.\n\nFinal rating: [b]94/100[/b]\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1514226857, "timestamp_updated": 1514226857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38667097": {"recommendationid": "38667097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254119554", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514564118}, "language": "english", "review": "Classic.

You play as a wolf, roaming the land to restore it to its former beauty. As a wolf you can do things like dig, bark, bite and recieve pat albiet only from  a few npc. Only dig have gameplay signficance but you can still prompt reaction from people. There a lot to do in this game, sidequest, collectable and even fishing. Your main method of gaining upgrade is aquiring praise, which you get for restoring land, helping people and feeding animals. As you progress through the story you unlock brush technique. There is a lot of interactivity with the enviroment that involve the brush technique thats worth disovering on your own. The brush technique lets you gain access to new area or treasures that were previously unreachable. \n\nCombat is equally prominent in okami as you'll need to slay the demons that are contaminating the land. Combat is standard action hack and slash but what make it special the interaction enemy have with the brush technique. Enemy will have certain weakness/resistance to brush technique for example the red imp instrument can be destroyed with slash brush technique when its been raised to block attack. Combat is not difficult and rather forgiving, at least for me. Those who are struggling could always use consumable which there are plenty and can be bought. The real challenge is to obtain blossom ranking at the end of combat. The game rewards you with more currency for beating enemy quickly and not taking damage. It is very difficult to obtain blossom rank on boss fight assuming you don't plan on save scumming or retrying. Its in your best interest to not die in the game as there is a game performance score at the end of the game which grant rewards. Thankfully time is not part of the game peformance score so you can take your time beating the game.\n\nIt runs fine on low specs machine and even on low quality the game is still georgeous.  Graphic option are lacking not that you would need a lot, but I would at least like view distance. If you running low spec remember to set your option before you starting the game, you don't want to listen to Issun and Sakuya for an agonising half an hour of unskippable dialogue due to the lag.\n\nAs a port, the biggest disappointment is the lack of mouse support for the menu. You have to navigate with keyboard. It would of been nice to have a brush cursor. Otherwise the game runs smoothly and the controls work.\n\nEdit*\nI forgot to mention about the beautiful soundtrack.

The story is great so it's not that it's boring, it's just so... so slow.\n\nThe technical issues are just minor cons in the grand scheme of things though.

wanted. Tried to launch the game, just for check what I've bought.

I played it when it came out for the Wii and in the end, I have 37 completed saves on my Wii with 15 unfinished ones. \n\nBefore I go anywhere with this I need to say: the port is amazing. Hearing about it I thought my computer would heat up trying to run it like it does with most ports. But it has no troubles running it at all so, I\u2019m pretty happy about that. \n\nThe game keeps your attention with interesting story telling and amazing gameplay. The game has its bugs of course but none of them are huge from my knowledge. The biggest bug I\u2019ve run into is an audio bug with the transformers. \n\nHowever I\u2019ve heard of people having trouble with controllers. I use a mouse and keyboard to play so I cannot say anything there. \n\nThe game caps at 30 FPS but I honestly couldn\u2019t care less. It looks and feels exactly like the original and that\u2019s all I care about. Sure, it would have been great at 60 FPS. But they announced that they tried to make it 60 and it broke the game pretty badly. So to me, it\u2019s something very small and has little impact. \n\nYou controls are fluid and don\u2019t expect you to be all over the place at once. The battles are fantastic, the weapons work and feel fluid. They give you options on how you want to fight with three types of weapons and the additional secondary weapon you are able to use to deal extra damage or give yourself defense so it\u2019s a very flexible game. \n\nIn the end: I would say buy it. If you\u2019re into amazing storytelling then this is the game for you. The game is extremely interactive with so many extra features and things to do. Extra side quests and lore that you can only uncover by going out of your way to look for. \n\nWhat I will say though is that, this game does not hold your hand. If you\u2019re looking for a game that drags you where you need to be then this game won\u2019t be very easy. The game incourages exploring and problem solving. But that\u2019s not saying they don\u2019t block off areas you\u2019re not suppose to be in. The game will nudge you but a lot of the game is taking hints. Anything important to where you are going next will be red text instead of black however so that helps. I never had problems with it but I know some friends who got stuck at certain points in the game (all pretty much the same points) so I thought I\u2019d add that. \n\nOverall, I\u2019d say get the game if you\u2019re considering it.

All the memories... Without thinking for a second, I bought it right away. Waiting for the game to download felt like a forever and it is kinda big game, which was a surprise.\n \nAfter opening it, i felt like i was 10 years old again, starting the game from the beginning for the 10th time, ready for experience it all again. All the battles, all the annoying moments when u have no fcking clue what ur supposed to do (except well, i still almost fully remember the game and the story), all the digging and barking without a reason, getting random items and not knowing how to use them, defeating bosses and exploring the maps.\n\nI havent yet finished the game, but it is great, just like back in the days. If you played this with console and you liked it, what are you waiting for? why havent you bought it yet? \n\nIf you are new and you havent ever heard about this, ask from yourself:\nDo you like to play games that have an animal as a main character?\nDo you want to get a brain cancer from not knowing what you are supposed to do?\nDo you like adventure games?\nDo you like a bit weird, not \"average\" artstyle?\n\n- if the answers are mostly yes, then buy it :) \n\nI cant really give a good review, bcs its so big thing to me. No one wouldnt understand how deep relationship i have with it ;D \n\nBut anyways, great game, looks good, story is something you wont see anywhere else and very unique game with stupid jokes that makes u laugh.

Here's why...\n\nI'm sorry to say that the HD seal is only applicable to some of the game art. You will sit through a painfully tedious low-res intro for what feels like an eternity before you start to exert some agency. By then the mawkish faux language of npcs really starts to grind. The control scheme -on controller- was alarmingly poor. The video angles consistently felt wrong and you keep having to reset the camera to face forwards. Then the unforgivably poorly mapped brush events start up in the orientation. The brush is not easy to control. It was not in the least bit fun. after several bodged attempts I randomly dabbed it about in a fit of exasperation. Et voila that worked better than the concerted efforts and got me through to the next screen. If you can make it past that point you have the endurance of Mo Farah's feet. I would admire anyone who does, if it wasn't simultaneously so pitiably senseless. \n\nI have a strong suspicion that the deliberate decision not to cast an editorial eye over this game was made in some misguided attempt to preserve its purity. A cursory amount of work on the perspective camera would have made this game immeasurably better. The devs did not even bother to upscale some of the art. As it stands the game creaks like a ten-year-old game would.

It's not a hard game by any means (I do feel it's very handholdy, especially if you've played it before), but the gameplay fits so well into it, it practically could not be in any other game, and offers a fun set of powers to unleash both on the world and the combat system.\n\nThe game controls excellently on mouse + keyboard.

Et une excellente occasion pour les autre de le refaire.\n Pour ce qui est du portage en lui m\u00eame il est n\u00e9anmoins regrettable de voir certaines choses ternir le tableau: La premi\u00e8re c'est le poids du jeu : 30 GB, c'est 15 fois plus que l'ISO ps2, je veut bien croire que les textures HD prennent plus de place mais \u00e0 ce point l\u00e0 c'est vraiment n'importe quoi.\n La seconde c'est l'optimisation, alors ne vous y trompez pas le jeu respecte parfaitement le cahier des charges (1080p/30fps) sur ma machine m\u00eame si je pense qu'on \u00e9tait en droit d'attendre du 60 fps. N\u00e9anmoins gros coup de gueule quand on regarde l'usage CPU: 80% SUR UN i5 4670k!!! A la mani\u00e8re d'assassin's creed origin je soup\u00e7onne l'\u00e9diteur d'avoir employ\u00e9 un DRM des plus exigent, c'est d'autant plus abb\u00e9rant qu'\u00e0 cot\u00e9 le jeu ne consomme que 250 Mo de Ram et que le GPU se touche la nouille.\n Enfin en lien avec la technique il faut savoir que sur pc le jeu dispose d'un support clavier/souris qui sur le papier promettait d'utiliser bien plus rapidement et facilement le pinceau, il est n\u00e9anmoins regrettable de voir que ce mod \u00e0 des r\u00e9sultats incertain en fonction des configs, pour ma part le pinceau est inutilisable \u00e0 la souris (il n'arrive pas \u00e0 reproduire le geste correctement et se t\u00e9l\u00e9porte par moment) et cela est \u00e0 mon avis \u00e0 mettre en lien avec l'utilisation CPU excessive due au DRM. Ce point est vraiment regrettable car il aurait pu apporter un vrai plus pour le gameplay. A noter que le jeu supporte les features de la manette ps4 \u00e0 savoir l'usage du pav\u00e9 tactile, c'est int\u00e9ressant mais personnelement je n'arrive pas \u00e0 grand chose avec (peut \u00eatre y a t'il les m\u00eames probl\u00e8mes qu'avec la souris). \nBref en conclusion et malgr\u00e9 les d\u00e9fauts que je viens de souligner, Okami HD reste un excellent jeu et l'exp\u00e9rience pc sera au moins aussi bonne que sur les autre versions (m\u00eame si je regrette le fait qu'elle aurait pu \u00eatre meilleure).

In fact I'd go as far as to say if you took the Wolf form from Zelda: Twilight Princess and put it in it's own standalone game with a highly stylized art style & Japanese Folklore theme, Okami is what you'd get. \n\nBoasting HD resolutions and textures, the crisp visual quality is definitely a step up from the Playstation 2 version I originally played. It's still locked in a 30fps framerate, which, given the graphics/art it seemed just fine to me. If you're not used to low framerates like that it'll take time to adjust but it's well worth it. Dismissing this amazing game outright over a framerate debate is one of the dumbest arguments I've heard to not play this installment if you've never touched this game at all. This is one of my all-time favorite games and a classic. If you want a real in-depth review of the gameplay itself, remember this is a 10 year old game, there's plenty out there.\n\nI'm just writing to highly recommend this game to anyone who loves the exploration & adventure genres. $20 for 30-60 hours of a beautifully crafted  & insanely fun gaming experience is well worth that price.", "timestamp_created": 1513935640, "timestamp_updated":

The opening sequence, including a very, very long unskippable cutscene, was extremely slow, and it felt like an endless wave of tutorial after tutorial. While the visuals were unique and attention-grabbing, it was not quite enough to sustain my interest.\n\nI put the game down in boredom and disappointment, and did not plan to come back. But I did, months after on a slow day, and boy am I glad I did so. I trudged through the remaining slow parts of the opening, and the game steadily picked up its pace. \n\nI became absorbed into its massive, sprawling world beautifully designed with meticulous care to detail. The accompanying soundtrack was at times catchy and at other times emotional, but always appropriate and gorgeous in execution, defying the technical limitations of being initially developed for the PS2. Characters were humorous and filled with personality in writing and in visual design. Combat was simple but satisfying. And of course, the Celestial Brush mechanic continuously impressed in its creativity and implementation.\n\nA few minor annoyances have not been fixed since even the PS2 days. The choppy and abrupt \"voice acting\" was perhaps tolerable in 2008, but not so much in 2017. Drawing with the Celestial Brush can be frustrating at times when the game simply refuses to recognize input. Some dialogue is still (seemingly arbitrarily) not skippable, leading to a feeling of being bogged down when I'm reading way ahead of the characters \"speaking\".\n\nOf course, the remastered visuals haven't been a case of simply flipping a switch to change the game's native resolution. Many textures have been significantly bumped up in clarity, and many particle effects are much cleaner in appearance. The game's unique thick brush stroke outlines are sharp and defined. The end result is a game that I'd readily believe is a modern 2017 release, albeit not of the same AAA calibre as it was. New options like bringing back the PS2 loading screen minigames are also appreciated.\n\nSpecial mention needs to be made about the game's controversial 30 fps lock. As someone with a 144Hz monitor and who is usually a stickler for higher framerates and refresh rates, I genuinely do not find it diminishing my experience too much thanks to the game's unique artstyle and specifically designed animations. However, it definitely was and still is a slight bummer that the now-universal 60 fps has not been implemented into this game's third re-release.\n\nThe keyboard+mouse implementation is acceptable. Some keybindings are strange (thankfully this is changeable in the menus) and the game's menus are not exactly mouse-friendly, but it wasn't too intrusive for the most part. In particular, drawing with the Celestial Brush felt extremely fast and intuitive, allowing me to draw at at a speed and accuracy far surpassing the Wiimote, much less other traditional controllers.\n\nDo I recommend this remaster of Clover Studio's masterpiece? Unequivocally yes, especially to the folks who have not yet experienced the game in any form. Fans of the original PS2/Wii release would surely appreciate reliving the experience with vastly improved visuals and perhaps a new method of input. For the owners of the PS3 HD remaster, this is really much of the same with 4K and keyboard+mouse input, so it really boils down to a judgment call.\n\nVisuals: 10/10\nSound: 10/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nStory: 9/10\nValue: 8/10\nOverall: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1513818667, "timestamp_updated": 1513819076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.842519", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38470863": {"recommendationid": "38470863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090415487", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514239553}, "language": "norwegian", "review": "So happy this is avilable for computer! \nI wish the screen had full screen as a standard setting, it happens that I click the wrong button and I have to quit the game just to get it back into full screen.

I was looking forward to this release for some. However, now that I'm a bit older and have time to actually review the game, I will say there there are some things lacking that I may of \"tolerated\" in my youth. Aesthetically, the game is flawless, it's beautiful,  the characters are very nice and combat is pretty flawless. It's easy to grasp without losing it's challenge.\n\nSo, not to scare you too much, I'll say a  lot of the pros here first and the cons will come later.\n-The Characters are memorable\n-The Music is ABSOLUTELY beautiful\n-The scenery is beautiful\n-There is a lot to do, small minigames available to play, side quest a'plenty, and plenty of demon scrolls to kill\n-Secrets a plenty, this game has a lot of replay value with a New Game+ Mode that makes the game easier and more fun with the abilities, weapons, etc in tact as well as bonus stuff at the end.\n-Yes, you CAN be petted and called a good dog.\n-The story is memorable and I have yet to NOT cry near the end from how beautiful it can get.\n-Each location is beautiful and unique, from the very first city you go to at the start of the game to the last area, you won't find anything about the locations  repeating themselves enough to be annoying.\n-Each boss brings something unique to the fight, normally dealing with clever ways of using the new brush techniques you learn to beat them.\n-Combat has a very nice flow to it, I haven't really died in the game yet, and only in more difficult fights like facing new enemies that I'm unfamiliar with do I have to worry about a prolonged fight. It's fast, it's quick, it doesn't break up the flow and some encounters can be avoided outright, as the random encounter fights - represented by flying red demon scrolls - can be avoided if you do not want to fight at all.\n\nThe pros outweigh a lot of the cons, but there ARE still cons, which I will try my best to  point out here.\n-The Characters are memorable...but annoying. The small not-Navi  Issun is annoying, stating things over that you already know, constantly pointing out the obvious, and repeating what people say to make sure you get it. Very rarely is any of his advice actually useful and you will normally be quickly clicking through even dialogue you haven't heard as it's normally just him repeating what another character has said. \n\n-The controls are very obviously made for a controller and I've found that my playthrough with a keyboard and mouse is...awkward, to say the least. After fidgeting with the controls a bit in the menu, I've gotten it more or less under control, but it's still awkward. Platforming is somewhat difficult, but the real con I've found is using the \"Celestial brush\", it's wonky, jagged and doesn't really respond well with a mouse, you get a more natural flow with a controller while you'll find yourself having some minor challenge in just drawing a circle with a mouse - I won't deny that this might just be my mouse's fault, but this is my experience so far.\n\n-There are far too many pauses in the game. You'll find that while you're running through the beautiful world of Okami, it has a poor habit of stopping the entire game to show you a short cutscene of it pointing out something obvious, like buildings, places of interests, etc even though you can see them normally quite clearly. Combine this with the fact that every pickup besides money will pause the game and give you a brief description of what it is you picked up, even when you've seen it a thousand times over, it gets pretty annoying and you'll find the flow of the game interrupted quite a lot.\n\n-Certain character motivations are a bit...strange. I won't spoil anything, but there are times in the story when it seems like the evidence behind a character's motivation was left out, or something was just added in as a secondary thought. This can leave you a bit dumbstruck at times, as you wonder why no one pointed this out to begin with or \"how the heck did you jump to THAT conclusion?\"\n\n-The plot is amazing, but some things are predictable. Good guys are obviously good, bad guys are obviously bad. Even when the story tries to paint it otherwise to fool you, you can normally tell if a character is good or evil pretty quickly. It tries to do this thing with keeping characters in the shadows until a big reveal, but it's pretty easy to tell who is who.\n\n-This is more a personal thing, but people treat a random white wolf walking into their city pretty...casually. Issun - I would imagine - is suppose to be there to sort of bridge a gap, since your character cannot talk, but people just spill out their life's problems to this random wild animal that doesn't bite them instantly, even when he's not hopping around and talking. Plus, your Godhood rarely comes out, even when people realize you're a God, it's just passed off casually. Maybe I'm just missing something, but it sort of irks me.\n\nThose are the few cons I can really think of off the top of my head. I hope this review helps you in whether or not you buy the game, as you might of noticed, I recommend it and I honestly do think that despite the flaws stated, this is a journey that you shouldn't pass up. It's a beautiful game with a beautiful atmosphere. Is it perfect?

Never got the chance to, but then Okami got released on PC and here we are now. This game is a true gem, something that feels like it was created out of love rather than as a money grab. It's jaw dropping how much detail was put into this game, and it will leave you hoping that it won't end yet.\n\nThe characters, the story, the silly dialogue... it's all very charming, and on top of that everything feels fresh and unique. You'll be getting to know so many characters in this game rather than being limited to only a handful like most games. I'm left speechless on what I could say really as there's just so many great things about it. It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a game so much, and for $20? This game is a steal as you'll end up getting more time out of it than the price listed.\n\nHonestly the 30 FPS doesn't bother me at all, this game runs extremely smoothly and if you're contemplating on getting it just because of the lock then go for it, you won't even notice it. Yes controller support is a little funky too but all you need to do is go through Big Picture Mode to get it working, and hell I might even recommend keyboard + mouse over controller because it makes it a lot easier to use your brush techniques (Which if you're like me will be using a lot). I'm using a controller but it's a little slow compared to the couple of minutes I used a mouse and keyboard, however both work perfectly for this game in my opinion.

Along the way you'll use your legendary divine brush techniques and natural abilities to battle demons, purify nature, and solve puzzles.\n\nThe closest analog in terms of gameplay would be Zelda, though it's definitely its own game. Combat is fun and engaging; every enemy type requires different tactics to defeat, and there are even fancier ways to beat each one in order to receive better rewards. It's very humorous with a great deal of levity throughout; there are some darker bits in the background, but for the most part it's all very light-hearted. It's also packed to the brim with references to ancient Japanese culture, though if you're playing a game about one of the more powerful deities in Shinto you shouldn't be too surprised about that.\n\nI own the original and the Wii version, and I by far prefer this PC port to either of them. As astounding as Okami is, it always felt like it struggled with its own controls a bit, especially with the painting mechanic. Now that you can use your mouse to paint with everything finally feels smooth and natural, and the keyboard controls for movement are just as good. The PC is definitely where Okami belongs.\n\nAs far as it being HD, it's definitely beautiful. Okami was always gorgeous, with bright, vivid colors and an art style intentionally reminiscent of traditional Japanese woodblock paintings, but the fuzziness was something of a pain to look at after a while. Now that everything is clean and sharp, it really brings out a lot of the game's life and artistic energy. I've read some people mentioning it being locked at 30FPS, but to be honest I haven't noticed, or at the very least it hasn't impacted my enjoyment of the game in any way. I certainly wouldn't shy away from a purchase just because of it.\n\nAll-in-all, I heartily recommend buying Okami HD on PC. If you've never played it before, this is definitely the best version to date, and if you own it on other systems, then this version is worth it for the controls alone.", "timestamp_created": 1513703247, "timestamp_updated": 1513703247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38433306": {"recommendationid": "38433306", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115614519", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513773124}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u82b1\u4e8650+\u5c0f\u65f6\u53c8\u901a\u4e86\u4e00\u904d\u5927\u795e\u3002\u867d\u7136\u51e0\u5e74\u524d\u5728PS2\u4e0a\u6253\u4e86\u597d\u51e0\u904d\u4e86\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u5f53\u6700\u7ec8\u6218\u7684BGM\u201cRESET\u201c\u54cd\u8d77\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u90a3\u4e48\u7684\u611f\u52a8\uff01\uff01\uff08\u8bdd\u8bf4\uff0c\u7247\u5c3e\u66f2RESET\u5462\uff1f\u600e\u4e48\u6362\u6210\u7eaf\u97f3\u4e50\u4e86\uff1f\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u6211\u5f88\u4e0d\u6ee1\u610f\u554a\u554a\u554a\u554a\uff09\u51e0\u4e4e\u5f88\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u2014\u2014\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u662f\u90a399\u9897\u73e0\u5b50\uff08\u5f3a\u8feb\u75c7\u4f24\u4e0d\u8d77OTZ\uff09\u8fd9\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e0d\u770b\u653b\u7565\u6536\u96c6\uff0c\u771f\u7684\u662f\u5de8\u8017\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5934\u90fd\u8f6c\u6655\u4e86@_@\u7ed3\u679c\u6700\u540e\u8fd8\u662f\u6709\u51e0\u9897\u770b\u4e86\u653b\u7565\u624d\u5165\u624bOTZ", "timestamp_created": 1513700249, "timestamp_updated": 1513700249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38432845": {"recommendationid": "38432845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198332845508", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513699384}, "language": "spanish", "review": "es muy bueno apesar de estar en ingles con lo basico que sabes es mas que suficiente los graficos son muy buenos me encanto este juego aparte que es con una tematica antigua de japon. lo mejor de todo es que te va contando la historia dentro de la historia real !!!", "timestamp_created": 1513698865, "timestamp_updated": 1513698865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38432704": {"recommendationid": "38432704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012964651", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514476952}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6ca1\u6709\u5199\u8fc7\u8bc4\u8bba\u7684\u6211\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u5927\u795e\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u6765\u4e00\u53d1\uff0c\u91cd\u6e29\u513f\u65f6\u7684\u611f\u52a8\u3002\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\u3002\n\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u6253\u5b8c\uff0c\u4e8c\u5468\u76ee\u6536\u96c6+\u51b2\u6210\u5c31\u4e2d\n\u6e38\u620f\u5f88\u591a\u7ec6\u8282\u90fd\u597d\u8bc4\uff0c\u8bf4\u4e2a\u6211\u4ee5\u524dps2\u7248\u6ca1\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002\u6e38\u620f\u8fdb\u884c\u5230\u5c0f\u4eba\u56fd\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u53bb\u4e00\u5bf8\u7684\u623f\u95f4\uff0c\u4e00\u95ea\u5212\u5f00\u4ed6\u623f\u95f4\u7684\u58c1\u753b\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1513698318, "timestamp_updated": 1513698318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38432470": {"recommendationid": "38432470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127647234", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513697641}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fdb\u6e38\u620f\u770b\u4e8620\u5206\u949fPPT\uff0c\u542c\u4e8620\u5206\u949f\u5514\u5440\u54aa\u54c8\u7684\u871c\u6c41\u914d\u97f3\n\n\u53ef\u522b\u8ddf\u6211\u8c08\u60c5\u6000\u3002\n\n\u5e78\u4e8f\u8fd8\u9001\u4e2a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u3002\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1513697530, "timestamp_updated": 1513697530, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.367752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38432367": {"recommendationid": "38432367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068286579", "num_games_owned": 531, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514384057}, "language": "english", "review": "A short review of the original game: It's very fucking great.

The gameplay is fun, both in and  out of combat, and the world and its dungeons are always testing your powers in new ways (unlike in Zelda, where you may get items that you really only use one time).

I'm not saying the game itself is bad, but rather the technical issues which have nothing to do with gameplay itself.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Awesome artstyle\n\n+ Japanese mythology is always interesting\n\nCons:\n\n- Hilarious controller bugs. Sometimes doesn't recognize controller on start, requiring a reboot of Steam or the computer. Note that these fixes don't work for everyone. Some users have even had mismapped controls.\n\n- Fullscreen/windowed bugs. Alt+tab returns you to a windowed mode that requires going back into the options to change it. Often will not remember fullscreen/resolution settings on game restart.\n\n- Draw distance is about 20 feet. Yep. Torches, bushes, etc. will NOT show up until you're what I would consider within 20 feet away. If you're running at full speed you will hit the torch and come to a halt before it even pops in.\n\n- 30 fps. Yes, the original was 30 fps and the physics are tied to it. However, this is 2017 and expectations have changed as technology has evolved and standards have increased. To all the apologists saying \"not every game needs 60 fps to look good\" and \"I can play the game just fine at 30 fps, I don't know why you can't\", clearly none of you have used a high refresh rate monitor or you primarily play on consoles. If you use a high refresh rate monitor or get motion sickness/headaches, you will most likely not be able to play this game.\n\n- Laggy camera. Just turning the camera with a controller feels like a chore. Even with the sensitivity maxed, turning the camera 180 degrees will take a few seconds. 360 degrees? Might as well go make yourself a snack while you're waiting.\n\n- Voices. They're like Animal Crossing but considerably worse and more annoying. Luckily you can mute them.\n\nI wanted to like this game.

Ce portage PC n'est pas si mauvais, m\u00eame plut\u00f4t bien r\u00e9ussi malgr\u00e9 certains d\u00e9fauts.\n\n[i] Ayant jou\u00e9 \u00e0 Okami sur PS2 il y a bien 8 ans, je me devais donc d'acheter le remake HD PC. [/i]\n\n\nPour commencer par le positif (portage) donc :\n\nLe jeu est vachement fluide. Je n'ai eu aucun drop de FPS. Le jeu est bien lock \u00e0 30 FPS, mais c'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9visible, les autres versions l'\u00e9taient aussi. (Note perso : ce n'est pas du tout d\u00e9rangeant, ce bloquage \u00e0 30FPS).\n\nVisuellement, le remake est bien r\u00e9ussi (m\u00eame si je ne peux pas le tourner en 4K).\n\nPour ma part, j'ai eu un petit probl\u00e8me avec ma manette, j'en reparlerais dans les points n\u00e9gatifs du portage. Sinon, je n'ai eu aucun probl\u00e8me avec (Xbox one wireless). Elle s'est bien connect\u00e9e du premier coup.\n\n\nBon maintenant, j'ai pu relever deux petits d\u00e9fauts concernant le portage PC :\n\nSi l'on ferme pas le jeu correctement, (ALT+F4 par exemple), une fois sur deux, le jeu va continuer de tourner en arri\u00e8re plan. Il faudra le fermer via le gestionnaire de t\u00e2che.\nEt ensuite, ma manette. Le seul probl\u00e8me que j'ai eu avec, c'est que ; Si elle se d\u00e9connecte pendant que je joue, une fois sur deux, le jeu ne va plus la reconna\u00eetre, et il faudra relancer le jeu \u00e0 nouveau.\nVoil\u00e0, \u00e7a c'\u00e9tait deux points personnel.\n\n\nBien, ensuite, le jeu en lui m\u00eame :\n\nJe le recommande vivement. L'originalit\u00e9 du gameplay au pinceau est vraiment top, m\u00eame encore aujourd'hui.\nLe concept de la toile sumi-e est vraiment joli. La 3D m\u00eal\u00e9e \u00e0 la 2D (arbres en 2D en plein milieu de mod\u00e8les 3D de personnages par exemple) est bien g\u00e9r\u00e9e. L'histoire est bien prenante, les personnages sont attachants, les musiques sont incroyables. Okami a un bestiaire bien complet. Le jeu dispose \u00e9galement d'une dur\u00e9e de vie de bien 40/50HS si vous ne connaissez rien au jeu et que vous vous attardez sur des choses annexes. (ex : [spoiler] essayer d'avoir le rang max partout sur l'\u00e9cran des r\u00e9sultats finaux du jeu, c'est-\u00e0-dire ; perles errantes, sph\u00e8res bonheurs, crocs du d\u00e9mon [/spoiler] ...)\n\n[i] Oui, les \"voix\" peuvent en ennuyer plus d'un. Pas de panique, on peut les d\u00e9sactiver dans le menu des options. [/i]\n\nBeaucoup comparent Okami \u00e0 un Zelda-like, alors ... Oui et non.\nOui, en effet, Okami est un RPG/action. Oui, il y a des donjons. Oui, il y a un syst\u00e8me d'arme et d'inventaire. \nEt non, car beaucoup d'autres jeux autre que la s\u00e9rie des Zelda peuvent \u00eatre compar\u00e9s \u00e0 Okami.\n\n\n[spoiler] Et non, \"Reset\", la version avec les paroles, n'est pas jou\u00e9e lors des cr\u00e9dits. Dans aucune version du jeu d'ailleurs. Comme pour la version PS3, Wii, Xbox. [/spoiler]\n\nPour conclure, en parlant du remake et non du jeu dans sa globalit\u00e9 ; je n'ai eu aucun r\u00e9els probl\u00e8mes avec le jeu, en tout cas, pas de bien m\u00e9chants. \nLe jeu, quant \u00e0 lui, je le recommande donc chaleureusement.", "timestamp_created": 1513555350, "timestamp_updated": 1514084201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519841", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38389331": {"recommendationid": "38389331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127594240", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 535, "last_played": 1516486260}, "language": "english", "review": "I honestly don't even know where to start to recommend this game. Yes, it's not a [i]perfect[/i] game, much like this review. It's gonna be lengthy, messy and full of heartfelt feelings.\n\nFor some people looking for a challenge, this might be too easy, shallow even.\n\nFor others, the art style or the artistic choice of using weird voice-like sounds instead of voice acting might be grating.\n\nFor some other, the lack of a 60 fps support might be fatal.\n\nBut if you're someone who enjoys Japanese mythology, can stand the 30 fps and is a casual gamer who still enjoys some fighting action, then this is the game for you. The art style is a gorgeous Sumi-e style painting, like an animated, beautiful canvas. And the best thing is, it's a canvas you can literally paint on.\n\nBut let me start from the beginning. In this game, you're a white wolf. Precisely, there's a Japanese legend that tells the story of how the great goddess of the sun, Amaterasu, took the shape of a wolf to save Japan. \"Okami\" can either mean \"wolf\" or \"great god\". There are many names you'll recognize if you're familiar with Japanese myths, mixed together in ways you're unfamiliar with.\n\nAnd this game sure makes being a god also feeling like a god. The world is your canvas and your divine powers can be manifested through the use of a Celestial Brush. Wind, fire, water - they'll dance at your whim as soon as you learn the skills.\n\nThe story, at the beginning, is almost light-hearted. What god doesn't want to dig up 10 Turnips and be declared the digging king (or queen)? However, as you progress through the game, the plot thickens. The more skills you learn, the more you'll have to use them to progress and to beat down your foes.\n\nSpeaking of foes, combat is smooth and satisfying. However, it's not especially difficult, so if you like a challenge you might want to either stay away and sacrifice all the beauty of this game, or look for the Devil Gate Trials. Possibly, with no items. Believe me, you'll have enough challenge to last you half a lifetime!\n\nFor combat, you have to use a combination of weapons and Celestial Brush to defeat whatever comes your way and as I said, it can be very satisfying. Some gods just want to watch the Imps burn! \n\nAlso, the game runs surprisingly well on keyboard and mouse. There's controller support, of course, and most of the time you'll want to use that, but keyboard/mouse work extremely well considering it's a console port. Movement is through WASD keys, mouse can be used to strike, parry, interact and draw. \n\nAs for technical problems, I personally haven't encountered any.\n\nMy opinion is most certainly biased, as I've been in love with this game for many, many years. And tell you what: I believe in my choice. And I believe that y'all should give a shot to this game, because damn, it deserves it.

It plays very similarly to games like Ocarina of Time and Kingdom hearts, with an added paintbrush mechanic that lets you shape the world like a god would. The game invokes a classical Japanese style in both visuals and music, and makes for a very artistic experience. However, unlike most modern art games, this comes with plenty of gameplay challenges. \n\nThis is a game that's been on my list of to-plays for a while. Wasn't willing to buy a new console for it and finding a copy for PS2 is near impossible. Really glad it's come to PC.\n\nThe port is very good, no graphical glitches or other bugs as far as I've seen. Runs just fine on a GTX 960. \n\nThe game works seamlessly with an xbox one controller plugged in, but I honestly would recommend using the keyboard/mouse controls instead. While the movement might feel a bit clunky with WASD (as opposed to a stick), the paintbrush mechanic feels so much smoother, which IMO improves the experience drastically. \n\nThe only downside I could find is the dialogue speed.

Upon release CPU usage while playing was weirdly high, but a couple days after that it was down to normal. I have seen a lot of complaints about controller support, but as I never play with a controller (the only game that recommended a controller that I couldn't actually handle with the keyboard is *Jet Grind Radio* though I assume an *Ape Escape* port would be just as troublesome) I didn't run into any issues with that.\n\nThere isn't much I have to say about the port as far as ports go. It works and it's better than I expected. I haven't really noticed the issue with being locked to 30 FPS that so many people seem to have\u2014it ran smoothly at an expected speed and I can't really ask for more.\n\nFor those of you who haven't already played *Okami* several times, the gameplay is similar to many of the Legend of Zelda games in that there are dungeons containing additional abilities as well as an open world rife with opportunities for exploration. Combat is a bit more involved than LoZ tends to be, and *Okami* bears a distinctive style derived from Sumi art. The game even has a filter that provides a scroll texture (there are in-game options to change the intensity) to make it feel even more like a painting.\n\nThe feature you'll be using the most during the game is your Celestial Brush. By holding down a button, you can pause time and paint on the screen to produce a variety of effects from a simple slash to creating bombs. Sometimes it's a bit finicky with the techniques that require a closed circle, but it's always been like that.\n\nIf you are thinking of getting it still, there are a few things you should know ahead of time:\n1) You spend the entire game playing as a white wolf who happens to also be a sun diety named Amaterasu.\n2) \"Doggo Quest\" might be a better name for the game.\n3) Cutscene dialogue can be a little slow\n4) The white noise characters speak with can get grating as hell if you're not used to it (fortunately, there is a specific option for turning down the volume of it)\n5) Yes, Issun annoys everybody\n6) Hold B (keyboard controls) to walk slowly. There's only one part in the game where that knowledge is useful, but nothing in the config options mentions that's how you do it.\n7) Press F when nothing is in your mouth to bark. Use this knowledge wisely by pressing it all the time.\n8) F1 is your friend for skipping cutscenes and will most often be used for skipping the cutscene for feeding animals.\n9) For the completionists out there, there are a couple missable collectibles (an enemy that only appears once and a stray bead) you should find a way to look up ahead of time.\n\nI really think Okami is one of those games everybody should play at least once in their life.

It stays true to its roots, with artwork that is simple, but gorgeous in its simplicity, and with wonderful more detailed examples of the artwork scattered throughout the game.\n\nThe gameplay itself is also a joy. Not only does Amaterasu herself feel very fluid and easy to control while fighting or platforming, but using the celestial brush is extremely easy to use and responsive. And with the HD remake, I find that I'm having absolutely no issues at all getting the brushwork to do what I want it to do, which I had little problem with in the original anyways. I personally also enjoyed the way that you use weapons, mixing and matching primary and secondary weapons to change up your fighting style.\n\nI know most people have already played Okami, but if you haven't, you are seriously missing out. It's a beautiful gem of a game, one-of-a-kind in every aspect.

The story simply keeps you buried within the game wanting to know more about the people around the lands and continue to help them out with their troubles. If you love wolves, Japanese culture, art, and music, this is the game you'll fall in love with. I noticed that the Developer is mentioned as Capcom. NO.

There's a variety of weapons and skills that keep things fresh as you progess in the story. And, I love this, the world opens up more and more as you get farther in the game. \n\nAs to the port, there's nothing lacking. The game works great. I had no issues with controls or graphics. It runs silky smooth and looks great. People cry about 30fps, but it really isn't an issue because of the beautiful water color art style this game sports. In any event, you really can't go wrong for a $20.00 game with 40+ hours of entertainment value. \n\nThis is a great game to add to your collection.

My parents wouldn't buy me a whole consle just for this game, so when I saw this I actually started crying. I'm thirteen now, and the wait has just made the whole experience sweeter.  I reccomend getting this game so much, once you get past all the introductory stuff it's so worth it. It has so many almost completly unessasary details woven into you wonder if the develpers were actually insane. It's so good. So good.

Das w\u00fcrde ich mir zumindest w\u00fcnschen.\n\nSTORY: Als helfende Wolfsg\u00f6ttin mit dem kleinen Issun als Begleiter geht man auf eine ereignisreiche und wundersch\u00f6n umgesetzte Reise, die mit viel Humor aufwartet, und die auch etwas ernstere T\u00f6ne anschlagen kann.\n\nK\u00c4MPFE: Es hat ja seinen Sinn zu k\u00e4mpfen. Man bekommt Geld und D\u00e4monenz\u00e4hne(wenn man wei\u00df wie). Anfangs ist es nat\u00fcrlich simple aber es gibt dojos in denen man dann f\u00fcr ingame Geld weiter Techniken erlernen kann ob f\u00fcr den kampf oder als Openworld F\u00e4higkeit  (zb Doppelsprung). Es gibt auf jedenfall jede Menge verschiedene Gegner die ihre eigenen Schw\u00e4chen haben, sobald man diese raus hat ist es relativ einfach. Ansonsten doch sehr interessant. Im laufe des Spieles habt ihr auch die M\u00f6glichkeit auf andere Waffen, die man dann ausstatten kann.\n\nSOUND: obwohl es keine gewohnte synchonisation gibt, wird denoch mit verzerrten stimmen den charakteren eine gewisse Authentische Pers\u00f6nlichkeit gegeben. Die Musik in diesem Spiel hat die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Auswirkungen auf den Spieler meiner Meinung nach. Sie ist nicht nur Wundersch\u00f6n sie passt auch immer wunderbar zur Situation.\n\n\nFAZIT\nEine Starke Geschichte mit gut geschrieben Charakteren die einen ans Herz wachsen. Simples Kampfsystem mit gut durchdachten Gegnern.

As someone who never played the Wii or PS2 version and so doesn't have a baseline or prior knowledge of the game, learning and playing is incredibly fun, and for the parts that are true to mythology, its incredibly interesting.\n\nPros:\n - Game looks stunning and the style is fantastic.\n - The gameplay is incredibly fluid.\n - No framerate issues ever.\n - The painting mechanic opens up some great puzzles and almost metroidvania elements.\n - Brush combat just feels so satisfying!\n - You play as a wolf. Bork. There is even a button dedicated to bork.\n\nCons:\n - On my weak PC, it uses up the majority of my CPU and actually causes issues using other apps on my PC. e.g. it lags my mouse movements and occasionally drops clicks. This is also occasionally an issue in the game as well, but is mostly noticable whilst painting. Lowering the graphics settings mostly remedied this without actually making the game look any worse.\n - F\u200bU\u200bC\u200bK THOSE MOLES OMG THEY ARE FRUSTRATING AF.\n - This game will swallow your life.

It runs flawlessly smooth at high settings with an i5-3470 and 760GTX.\n\nSome of the rough points with the port quality is that the game eats up CPU more than GPU. My GPU fan never throttled up the entire time playing, but the game is a port from the PS3, so it should run fine off modern integrated graphics without need for a dedicated card at all. I'll have to see how well I can get it to run on my tablet that plays Skyrim beautifully smoothly. Another was having to tell Steam to enable controller support, but I believe that is a Steam issue more than game issue.\n\nPeople complain about the 30FPS, but I can't tell a difference from it on PC and having played it on PS2, Wii, and PS3 before, it plays identically as well, it's just the PS3 HD version ported to PC, as far as I can tell, nothing added, nothing removed, game is rather untouched except for steam achievements. But the winner to me about it is that the game is stable and an amazing game to have brought to modern systems/hardware that I can continue to enjoy for many more years to come.\n\nWith all the hours I have put into this game so far, it is more stable than a lot of non-ported games I've played before, major titles too.

I bought the remaster on PS3, and having it's on PC is more useful to me as I can take it where I go and I can do things in the background while playing. \n\nThis will be a long review, so I'll give a TL:DR here. \nIs this game worth \u00a315.99 / $20? Yes. \n\nAnd now, onto the longer review. \nI'll admit that I was dubious when starting up this game, solely because of the keyboard/mouse controls. Like, this was a console game and the Wii port looked very uncomfortable to me, so I thought that PC-controls would be equally bad. I was extremely wrong. The mouse works very well (once my sensitivity was lowered) as a camera, and it's more controllable than it ever was. This means that frustrating levels with thin platforms you have to go across are much easier to do. \nOf course, you can change your keybindings but for me, the default are very well-done. Nothing's too difficult for my fairly small hands to reach, and everything feels very polished. \nThe graphics are wonderful, and it runs very smoothly at 30fps; and I will push that this game is meant for 30fps. After all, it's originally a PS2/PS3 (let's ignore the Wii) port, and that generally ran at 30fps. Since the animations are made for it, it runs very well and I would advise Capcom to keep it capped like this no matter what people say, as the game works best in this. Will it be frustrating for people used to higher? Probably not. You can barely tell it's 30fps. It's ideal. \nThe minimum specs are probably incorrect as my laptop isn't very high-end. I'm running AMD Radeon R5 and it doesn't stutter the slightest. I expect a lot of computers/laptops can handle it, though be careful if you have a complete potato. \n\nSome people may be tempted to skip the cutscenes, even on their first run through. Don't. The story is beautiful and intricate, the artwork is gorgeous, and overall, it's a very good game plot-wise. \nThe prologue is long but interesting, and there are many more to come that are just...breathtaking. \nNaturally, the soundtrack follows in its footsteps; Okami has one of the best (if not THE best) soundtrack of all time. Considering the game's setting, the music is heavy based around traditional Japanese music, and uses various traditional instruments, too. I won't spoil, but the final boss battle has stunning music and if I were going just from that, I'd still say to buy it.\n\n\u00a315.99/$20 is not much considering the content given. Not only are the graphics hugely upscaled from PS3-days (which was a HD Remaster too), but the game offers hundreds of hours of content. From collectibles such as Stray Beads to just exploring the world, Okami has high replayability and New Game+ is superb in this game; once you complete the game for yourself, you'll see. \nWith so much to do, it's hard to complain about the price! Keep in mind that this is a classic game originally made back in 2006, so it's eleven years old and it's definitely managed to keep up with more recent games. Even back then, it was ahead of its time; and even now, replaying it makes me realise just how gorgeous it is. \n\nA lot of people compare it to the Legend of Zelda franchise, and they're right to do so! But don't go into the game expecting some sort of Zelda clone - it's unique and the dungeons are very interesting, with puzzles that are surprisingly clever. Also, you play a wolf for 100% of the game so that's...that's definitely different. \nIf you're a first-time player, you'll definitely find the atmosphere amazing. From unsettling dungeons and monsters to truly heartwarming moments, Okami is a highly emotional game that makes me cry from time to time even when I know what's going to happen. It knows the exact music to use, and knows what sort of tone to set for each step of the plotline (and, my god, it is a long plotline that interests me to no end). \nThe Celestial Brush feature is best used on PC, as your mouse gives you complete control over it. It's extremely well-ported, and I would recommend this to gamers of any level. To hardcore gamers some of the fights may be easy, but there is a difficulty spike that may come your way! Or you can challenge yourself by using only low-end weapons (the rosary challenge is one of my personal favourites). No matter what you do, Okami always has more and knows how to please its fanbase.\nNot to mention that once you complete the game you unlock some bonus content which includes the soundtrack and concept art and, I'm not going to lie to you, it's very much worth it. \n\nAmazing artwork, a great soundtrack, a wonderful plot + good controls for a port; what more could you want? It's a wonderful experience and I really would recommend to try it out.", "timestamp_created": 1513267288, "timestamp_updated": 1513267288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38303893": {"recommendationid": "38303893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170690487", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 64, "last_played": 1515342083}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5728\u7f51\u6613\u4e91\u4e0a\u542c\u52a8\u611f\u65b0\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u6b4c\u5355\u5076\u7136\u542c\u5230\u300a\u5927\u795e\u300b\u4e13\u8f91\uff0c\u770b\u5230\u8bc4\u8bba\u8bf4\u5927\u795e\u91cd\u7f6e\u4e86\uff0c\u6211\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f\u5f53\u5373\u8d76\u6765steam\u9884\u8d2d\u4e00\u624b\n\u4e00\u5bf8\u6cd5\u5e08\u548c\u767d\u91ce\u5a01\u7684\u5947\u5999\u5386\u9669\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u753b\u9762\uff0c\u6d53\u90c1\u7684\u548c\u98ce\u6c34\u58a8\uff0c\u522b\u5177\u4e00\u683c\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\n\u521b\u610f\u6ee1\u5206\uff01\u97f3\u4e50\u6ee1\u5206\uff01\u5267\u60c5\u6ee1\u5206\uff01\u753b\u9762\u6ee1\u5206\uff01\n\u7528\u4e86\u5341\u4e8c\u5e74\u7684\u5934\u50cf\uff0c\u4e00\u628a\u9f3b\u6d95\u4e00\u628a\u6cea\u4e86\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u8bf4\u4ec0\u4e48\u5462\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1513267273, "timestamp_updated": 1513267273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38303781": {"recommendationid": "38303781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151098229", "num_games_owned": 531, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513341398}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u91cc\u9762\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u592a\u795e\u5947\u4e86\uff0c\u542c\u7740\u5934\u75bc\u3001\u3001\u3001\u4fe1\u4f7f\u597d\u8bc4\uff0c\u753b\u98ce\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9519", "timestamp_created": 1513266865, "timestamp_updated": 1513266865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38303730": {"recommendationid": "38303730", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971857001", "num_games_owned": 1547, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513320613}, "language": "english", "review": "Dog barking and chasing it's tail simulator.\n", "timestamp_created": 1513266703, "timestamp_updated": 1513266703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38303705": {"recommendationid": "38303705", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985803330", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513313109}, "language": "english", "review": "I've tried multiple times trying to connect my PS4 controller to play Okami on the pc but it never works.

I played it on a friend's system and really loved it. I was happy to be able to buy my own copy, and on a system I owned. The game itself is good and I like the art style. \n\nMy main problems come down to the little things. It doesn't feel like a good port of the game. It kind of feels like they did the bare minimum to  get it to work on the computer and update the graphics so it doesn't pixilate. You can't change the graphic size in game, only it's \"quality\".\nThere is no controller customization, although I have to say the built in steam controller settings are fantastic. There is no real mouse support in menus. Yes it controls the brush and camera but no cursor no clicking on things. The choice on keyboard controls are just odd.

I've beaten this game in its entirety once before. \n\nOkami is one of the best video games I\u2019ve ever played and this is why.\n\nAbout so many years ago, the first time I ever played it. I didn\u2019t realize going in what kind of game it really was. It wasn\u2019t explained properly to me, I blame this on poor marketing at the time and on myself for not doing more research before buying it.\n\nSo I start this game up, and the first thing you\u2019ll notice is this very long and drawn out opening cut scene, not much to it mind you but it tells a simple story well, sets a stage and the moment it closes, it opens with someone ending the world, or well you know, getting the end started as if he never really heard the story we just heard, himself. \n\nOpen to and without giving too much away, we meet our main characters. This game is fun, it\u2019s dire and it\u2019s right to the point. From the very beginning you realize exactly who you are and how you as a character fit into this story being told. I was hooked. I laughed out loud many, many times. It\u2019s use of humor is downright disarming at times.  So many times we watch what could be a good movie ruin it\u2019s own jokes because the film maker didn\u2019t trust their audience to \u201cget it\u201d and they didn\u2019t understand to wait a few beats before moving on to the next joke. Not a problem here. The humor never serves to undercut how serious the game is and it doesn\u2019t come at the expense of the player\u2019s disbelief, most importantly. Hard line to walk for some. This being said, I laughed out loud many times during this game. \n\nBut why might you love it as I do?\n\nHave you have ever played a game and wished with every fiber of your being at the end, it wasn\u2019t actually going to stop? That was my reaction the very first time I played Okami. I was getting to the end, I beat the final boss\u2026 and that\u2019s when you find out you\u2019re maybe half way done. It was a revelation, I had never played a game that set me up so well that I didn\u2019t even understand the primary conflict wasn\u2019t in fact close to over. This game does such a great job of defying your expectations giving way to genuinely welcome surprises.\n\nI\u2019d go on but I really don\u2019t want to ruin this game for you. It\u2019s a steal at 20 bucks. The art style alone made sure this game is ageless. Add on top of that, the fact that it will most likely be on sale during the Winter Sale starting on the 21st on this month\u2026 just throwing that out there and I still didn\u2019t wait because well it\u2019s amazing and as I said a steal even at 20 bucks. XD \n\nDo you enjoy games like Legend of Zelda? Do you wish more games like it came out v.i.a. Steam? Do you love beautiful intimate stories wrapped up in ancient mythology with a sense of humor?  This game was literally made for you and me. \n\nMay your brush, leave songs of color and shape on the canvas of life as well! \n", "timestamp_created": 1513247332, "timestamp_updated": 1513247332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38292329": {"recommendationid": "38292329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050226235", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 304, "last_played": 1516513967}, "language": "english", "review": "Okami has been and always will be my favorite ps2 game.

The keyboard and mouse are also compatible with the game, but has some sort of issues.\nAgain, I haven't had any problems with frames and am definitely looking forward to playing this game much more.\n\nPros\n-Absolutely gorgeous\n-You are a wolf, and you can get pet by people\n-The fighting feels natural\n-The brush strokes also feel natural\n-Story is interesting\n\nCons\n-Keyboard/Mouse Functions", "timestamp_created": 1513225471, "timestamp_updated": 1513225471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38294128": {"recommendationid": "38294128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121885468", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513352752}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5b8c\u5168\u6253\u4e0d\u5f00\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u81f3\u4eca\u8fd8\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\nemmmmmm\u91cd\u88c5\u4e86\u4e00\u904d\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u73a9\u4e86\u7136\u800c\u5f00\u5c40\u9ed8\u8ba4\u53cd\u8f6c\u9f20\u6807\u867d\u7136\u627e\u5230\u600e\u4e48\u6539\u4e86\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002 \u7136\u540e\u5c31\u662f\u5207\u4e0d\u4e86\u65e5\u6587 \u8ba9\u6211\u53ea\u80fd\u53bb\u7b49\u6c49\u5316\u8865\u4e01\u4e86\n\u5c0f\u6bdb\u75c5\u4fee\u5b8c\u5c31\u6539\u597d\u8bc4XD", "timestamp_created": 1513225459, "timestamp_updated": 1513267584, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490650", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38294052": {"recommendationid": "38294052", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056934926", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514657644}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u72d7\u5934\u90fd\u5feb\u8981\u649e\u79c3\u4e86\u3002\u3002\u3002\n\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\u89c6\u89d2\u63a7\u5236\u5f88\u8ff7\u5f88\u96be\u7528\n\n\u8bdd\u8bf4\u4fe1\u4f7f\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u597d\u770b\n\u5305\u9e21\u5305\u9e21", "timestamp_created": 1513225042, "timestamp_updated": 1513225079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38294044": {"recommendationid": "38294044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198419888743", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513601661}, "language": "schinese", "review": " \u6700\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u6e38\u620f", "timestamp_created": 1513225020, "timestamp_updated": 1513225020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501511", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38293788": {"recommendationid": "38293788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198362510952", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 128, "last_played": 1516058631}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Muito bom", "timestamp_created": 1513223838, "timestamp_updated": 1513223838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480769", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38293785": {"recommendationid": "38293785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065450768", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513737662}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is perfect.

Sadly Okami never got the appreciation this game definitly deserves, so which i comes out for almost every console lol.\n\nSo, the story teaches you about the japanese culture. Not 1/1 of course. \nBut as the goddess of the sun in a wolf look you fight against the evil gods like Orochi, Yami etc. to save the world.\nMany people compares it to Zelda. I find it\u00b4s a good comparison.\nThe art fits in the game: instead of weapons (which you also have) you use a brush to f'ck the enemies and helps you to get further.\n\nFor the port: in the beginning the game didn\u00b4t recognize my xbox 360 controller. After some restart and button smashing I finally could use it. The game runs smoothly enough. Just the controlspeed is a bit strange compared to ps3 and ps2 version (Wii used the swing thing). But after a while I can deal with it. \n\nThis game don\u00b4t need 60 fps and it\u00b4s a good port. I mean, with 4 different console ports and now a pc port capcom knows how to.\n\nBuy it.

So be sure to mind the gap. Even then, I will cover aspects of the PS2 version, of the sequel on NDS, and of this re-release in HD. Good? Good. Here we GO!\n\nWhen I heard about Okami back then it was very common for me to hear comparisons between this and Legend of Zelda, how many aspects crossed over, most notably the art style that for some reminded them of Legend of Zelda Wind Waker, an in my searches there were even that prototype trailer where the game was planned to feature realistic art instead of the sumi-e inspired from the final release. For me, art style wasn't what attracted me, but the simple fact that Okami was the closest PS2 would ever get to a Legend of Zelda.\n\nAnd does not disappoint.\n\nOkami's progression and Zelda's have many common points: you are required to earn the abilities to progress, the environment is designed in such way that every map feels unique and SHOWS unique aspects, the art and music are just perfect and something to be considered a masterpiece from PS2 era that stands strong to this age, even the way you grow your health is similar. The game spans HOURS, even if you do not count cutscenes, and there are many secrets to find even under rocks. If you die, chances are it won't count towards the end game results, due to how the game early on introduces you to a bit of a mercy function called \"Astral Pouch\", which acts like fairies did in Zelda except you gradually refill it by gathering food items.\n\nBut of course, for long the good memories of Okami have gone into thatfor me: a memory. We had to sell our PS2 as well as every game we had with it, just to get a Xbox 360. To this day, I regret that choice, should have kept the PS2, and nothing after that helped. PS2 emulation is awfully unreliable and unstable, there was no one I knew that had the system or the console. And with no sequel in sight... I felt a desire that could not be satiated. Not until Okamiden that is.\n\nWith Okamiden out, unfortunately all I could do was emulate, and it was very hard to get even 45 FPS on the PC I had by then, but I still forced myself to bear with it, I had to. Aside from the issues due to, of course, the dawn of NDS emulation, I still went on and enjoyed the game, getting a 100% on my second run and later runs of it. For a NDS game, it seemed to expand the boundaries of the system, just like a few games did too, and the style was still as pleasant as ever.\n\nNow that I have a 2DS, all I seek is buying the game cart, however by now I'm waiting to see if it gets an updated re-release. If Okamiden gets an updated re-release, I will jump to it ASAP. How fast I'll buy it depends on where it will be released. If on 3DS, unfortunately means I have to wait availability in Brazil, which can take one or two months from USA release and half a month of shipping. But if on PC... I'll buy the moment the preorder pops up!\n\nAs a matter of fact, this is what I did: Bought Okami HD without a second thought as soon as I saw the news on Preorder. Didn't know of preorder bonuses or anything, I saw it and thought \"OH MY GOD, I CAN RELIVE THE GOOD TIMES AT LAST!\", and the fact it was to be released on my birthday made me squee in sheer joy. I didn't get anything aside of clothes on my bday, so when this game dropped into my account I could safely say Capcom gave me the best birthday gift anyone has ever given. Thank you so much, Capcom, for making my special day truly feel special for once.\n\nDespite rising controversies in the Discussions and issues, I had minimal to no problem on my end: Okami HD runs smooth, the framerate is the exact same as it was in PS2, the keyboard and mouse support are really well implemented, loading times are really low and controller response is perfect. It really feels like I'm back to one of my favorite games ever, and without having to hog a TV.\n\nSo, in regards to a common controversy: The game IS 30 FPS, yes, but so was the original PS2 game, so is several other games all around. Even 3DS games are 30 FPS if you turn on the 3D mode, 30 FPS have been around for long, so why care now? I never felt it was 30 FPS, it always felt at a good pace for me. If anything this game could optionally have is a text speed slider, and... That's it, really. All else is perfect as is, there's no need to risk breaking the game for the sake of the \"60 FPS is superior\" meme.\n\nAs usual, Capcom delivers joy and hope when all seems lost. And as excited as I was for Okami HD to finally come out in a system I could play, I am too excited for the bright future they are giving to Mega Man and in believing that their games can succeed on PC.\n\nOne more, thank you Capcom, for much more than you can imagine.", "timestamp_created": 1513197962, "timestamp_updated": 1513197962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511628", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38287747": {"recommendationid": "38287747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028906329", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513312696}, "language": "english", "review": "I am the kind of person who has a really hard time re-reading books, re-watching movies, and re-playing video games.

Ein Zelda-\u00c4hnliches Meisterwerk, welches f\u00fcr mich immer noch DAS Spiel ist 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1513183821, "timestamp_updated": 1513183821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496183", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38283670": {"recommendationid": "38283670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047360378", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514426086}, "language": "french", "review": "Okami, un jeu que je voulais faire depuis tr\u00e8s longtemps, l'histoire est g\u00e9niale, la BO est g\u00e9niale et les contr\u00f4les au clavier sont bien foutu pour ma part j'ai pas eu de probl\u00e8mes, j'ai pas tester la manette mais \u00e7a \u00e7a me d\u00e9range pas, les jeu est bloqu\u00e9 \u00e0 30fps mais c'est pas du tout g\u00eanant, le jeu est magnifique en 1080p full ultra, aucun lag ressenti, le jeu est vraiment bien optimis\u00e9, si vous n'avez jamais fais ce jeu, foncez, c'est un Must-Have du jeu-vid\u00e9o je recommande \u00e0 100%.

I can't even play this game on lowest settings without the fps dropping to around 15.. is this a bug or is the game just this badly ported? I'm really disappointed as I've waited more than 3 weeks for this game to unlock. I'm a big Okami fan and has been since I was young. I was really hyped for this game to be out on PC, on Steam, but this is basically unplayable.. not gonna refund it because I have hopes they can fix it soon enough. \n\nAnd since it's Okami, I'm gonna recommend it nonetheless. This game deserves all the love.. a bit more love than what went into the making of this port..\n\nEDIT: Can be helpful for some who may experience the same problem!

The PC platform is all about options, and Okami HD falls painfully short in that regard.

One thing I am glad to have in this game is the possibility to define the 4:3 original display because I actually DO still use a 4:3 screen still. I'm a late caveman with adaptation to the majority's tastes and I am still a lover of 4:3 size. I do care of the availability of such settings on games such as this one and I am not sure in which ways the 30 fps limitation does affect the gameplay of any game as like to really make a difference. However this matter could be very subjective according to what one wants to do with a game, such as speedrun it or things like that, like get to its limits as a gamer challenge. So I may end this review about this game which I consider a damn fantastic masterpiece of cell shading use by a question although I did read some reviews that say the framerate limitation won't be an issue.

I'm going to mainly talk about the port; the game itself is excellent and most everybody on the internet who has played it agrees.\n\nLet's explain the elephant: 30fps.  Yeah, it's unfortunate.  But it's perfectly acceptable given the nature of the engine.  The PS2's CPU and GPU are notorious for being inexorably tied to one another in many ways, and games were developed with this in mind for performance reasons.  This is the only \"con\" I have for this port.\n\nResolution? 4k, no problem.  The art style flourishes at this resolution.  You'll notice some mildly blurry textures if you stop and stare at the scenery for a few moments, but don't do that, you're a fox-goddess and you leave trails of beautiful life energy (... okay, grass) in your wake.\n\nPerformance? Fantastic, though I'll admit my computer is likely a bit above spec for this game, especially capped at 30fps.\n\nBut HERE is the true reason I've left a review for this game.  It has complete 100% support for the Steam Controller API.  Games NEED TO BE DOING THIS.  Steam has created the best interface so far to let you use whatever controller you like in whatever game you like.  I'm sick of seeing XInput controller icons with my Dualshock 4.  This is why I was absolutely floored and delighted when I saw a square icon for the attack prompt.

I cannot recommend this game enough if you love adventure games and haven't played it yet for whatever reason.\nThe following will be a short review since I lack the time for a more complete one and keep in mind I have already completed the game on PS3 but rest assured this new PC version definitely sits as the definitive version of the game and here's why:\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nFantastic and unique style that blends exploration, puzzles, light action elements with several weapon combinations and move sets, and all of this combined with the \"Celestial Brush\" which allows you to pause time and paint on your screen to use your godly powers to your advantage.\n\n[h1]Music:[/h1]\nAbsolutely beautiful soundtrack based on traditional Japanese music which perfectly conveys the uplifting emotion of the storyline. You could go as far as to say \u014ckami boasts one of the best soundtracks ever composed for a game and it actually won \"Best Score Award\" at the 2007 BAFTA Video Game Awards.\n\n[h1]Story and Characters:[/h1]\nIt initially starts quite slow but in due time you will be launched on an unforgettable adventure throughout medieval Japan as the wolf reincarnation of the Shinto Sun Goddess: Amaterasu. You will meet plenty of characters based on both Buddhist and Shinto mythology, all of them with their own personality quirks and certainly quite memorable. By the end of the story, you will have lived through numerous exciting and surprising plot twists, incredible moments and the ending will most probably leave you crying in pure joy.\n\n[h1]Graphics and Art:[/h1]\nBased on ancient ukiyo-e paintings, \u014ckami still looks absolutely fantastic to this day thanks to a timeless art-style and excellent designs. You will be transported to a magical world full of pure eye-candy.\n\n[h1]PC Port Quality:[/h1]\nWorks perfectly on 2 of my computers, no controller problems at all and keyboard controls are great. New settings have been added to the game including a voice volume control and the previously missing loading screen mini-games which you might want to disable since the loading times are so low anyway.", "timestamp_created": 1513177462, "timestamp_updated": 1513177553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568345", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38281523": {"recommendationid": "38281523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319220512", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513188100}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4fe1\u4f7f\u6211\u9886\u5230\u4e86\uff0c\u6709\u6ca1\u6709\u5927\u795e\u77e5\u9053\u58c1\u7eb8\u5728\u54ea\u91cc\u9886", "timestamp_created": 1513177451, "timestamp_updated": 1513177451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38281464": {"recommendationid": "38281464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121882253", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513882426}, "language": "french", "review": "Ce jeu !!

For now Here's my two cents. Know that I have not played nor seen the old Okami. \n\nFirst impression:\n\n+1 for the graphics. It's different, but just as stunning.\n+1 for the story. There's a ton of zombie, apocalyptic, battle royale games out there right now. That makes this more interesting.\n+1 for the character. Who doesn't love a white wolf? I mean, come on. \n\n-1 for the supposed 'voice' over. The somewhat scratchy sound makes it quite difficult to put on headphones and be immersed in the soundtrack. Thus, it's a major turn off. I hope they just used the actual Japanese voice over, if there is/was in the old Okami. \n\nMore reviews soon.

Man kann sich nun dar\u00fcber aufregen oder nicht. Ist halt so. 60fps f\u00e4nd ich auch sch\u00f6ner. Daran liegt es also nicht.

Hier hilft es wirklich nur, den Regler f\u00fcr die Sprachausgabe nach links zu stellen. Schnell. Am besten noch bevor man das Spiel startet.\n\nDie Grafik. K\u00f6nnte wirklich schick sein. Ich finde die Idee mit der Pinselgrafik charmant. K\u00f6nnte. H\u00e4tte. Fahrradkette... Leider kommt man an einem Haufen \"toller\" Grafikeffekte nicht vorbei, da die Grafik nicht indivduell einstellbar ist. Es gibt ledeglich vorgegebene Presets. Also darf man sich \u00fcber \"hochwertiges\" Geblurre freuen...nicht!\nF\u00fcr alle, die Aufl\u00f6sungen jenseits der 1920x1080 vermissen, weil doch 4K versprochen wurde: Geht nur, wenn ihr von \"Vollbild\" auf \"Fensterlos\" einstellt. Insgesamt sieht die Grafik dank v\u00f6llig \u00fcbertriebener Effekte so aus, wie ein 3D-Kinofilm ohne 3D-Brille. \n\nDer Abt\u00f6rner war dann letztendlich im Gameplay zu finden. Das Malen. Keine Ahnung, wie es funktionieren soll. Das Tutorial dazu ist absolut nicht hilfreich. Nach 20 Minuten umherprobieren und immer wieder nervig aufploppender Fenster mit nicht hilfreichen Erkl\u00e4rungen und krampfigen Gefuchtel mit den Analogsticks gab es den Bossmove: Alt+Tab->Proze\u00df beenden, Steam->Hilfe->Steam-Support, R\u00fcckerstattung beantragen.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1513166392, "timestamp_updated": 1513166392, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6,

If you're a big fan of Action-Adventure games, especially things like Zelda, then you will like this.\n\n30FPS and lack of 16:10 or 21:9 support may be a turn off for some. Really, the game controls and looks fine at 30FPS. I had no problems adjusting to it, but if you run different resolution monitors I can understand the pass. Performance-wise, 30FPS was consistent through the whole experience, even during periods of heavy combat. The higher resolutions do the art style some serious justice. Nipon has never looked better.\n\nDepending on how much you like side-questing, collecting and exploring, the game can take you anywhere from 20 to 45 hours to complete: on a first playthrough, no less! The game's use of drawing as a mechanic and the combat system go hand-in-hand flawlessly and mastering both keeps the game fresh throughout.

The art direction and soundtrack are beautiful. For a fairly linear game, I found the story to be incredibly entrancing and interesting with a good number of turns (you know which turn I'm talking about specifically-- she busty ;)). Long story short, this game is a must play. It is excellent. One of the best games I've ever played. It's also one of the only games I can come back and sincerely enjoy after playing it through like 12 times.\ufeff \n\nNOTE- Yes, it is capped at 30. No I personally don't feel like it makes that huge of a difference. Still clear as day and smooth as butter. Beautiful. \nNOTE 2- Despite the negative reviewers leaving \"no controller support\" comments-- yes the game does have controller support obviously and it works just fine.

I was so excited to hear it was coming to PC, I told everyone who would listen and now that it's hear it's incredible. The framerate is great, the story is just as good I remember, it's only gotten better in my opinion because I can take it with me wherever I go on my laptop. It doesn't require a best of a computer, the only downside is it's very large, but not as large as GTA V or Skyrim so it's marginal. Over all this game is my ABSOLUTE favorite game, I couldn't think of anything else I would want on PC besides this game, left alone with only game to play for the rest of my life, it would Okami, always. I played it when it first came out in 2006, I was about ten at the time, and immediatly fell in love with it. It's not for everyone, I understand that many won't enjoy the gameplay, the graphis, the art style, but I would say anyone who is looking for something new should at least give this game a single try, I can't imagine anyone would regret it. Lots of love for this game and for Clover Studio who also came out with Veatiful Joe, I miss that game, good old Game Cube. \n\nTLDR; I would recommend this game to everyone, hands down my favorite game and I can't even begin to describe how excited I am to play it over the Christmas holiday and for years to come! <3", "timestamp_created": 1513146264, "timestamp_updated": 1513146264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526119", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38273844": {"recommendationid": "38273844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301009362", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 244, "last_played": 1516433167}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u88abOST\u62c9\u5165\u5751\uff0c\u81f3\u4eca\u6bcf\u5929\u90fd\u542c\uff0c\u5c5e\u4e8e\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u4e70\u4e09\u5f20\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\n\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u662f\u5b83\u53d1\u884c\u5feb\u5341\u5e74\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0cClover Studio\u65e9\u5df2\u5173\u95e8\u5927\u5409\uff0c\u5927\u795e\u4e5f\u5df2\u65e0\u4eba\u95ee\u6d25\uff0c\u800c\u6211\u5219\u540e\u6094\u8fd9\u4e48\u4e45\u624d\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5b58\u5728\n\u5c31\u7b97\u4f60\u5361\u5a4a\u7092\u51b7\u996d\uff08\u8fd8\u662f\u4e24\u6b21\uff09\uff0c\u5c31\u7b97\u6ca1\u6709\u4e2d\u6587\uff0c\u6211\u8fd8\u662f\u8981\u4e70\uff08\u987a\u4fbf\u5165\u624b\u4e86PS4\u9650\u5b9a\u7248\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u4e0d\u7528\u95ee\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4e00\u5b9a\u5c31\u8981\u4e70\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4e4b\u4e00\n\u5bf9\u4e86\uff0c\u9884\u8d2d\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u58c1\u7eb8DLC\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u6839\u76ee\u5f55\u7684Wallpaper\u6587\u4ef6\u5939\u91cc\n\u8fd8\u6709\u4eba\u63d0\u5230\u753b\u9f99\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u753b\u9f99\u53ea\u7528\u5728\u7f3a\u5c11\u7684\u661f\u661f\u70b9\u4e00\u4e0b\u5c31\u597d\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0d\u7528\u6cbf\u7740\u661f\u661f\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e00\u76f4\u753b\u7ebf", "timestamp_created": 1513146186, "timestamp_updated": 1513171034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38273832": {"recommendationid": "38273832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257102811", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513238887}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u624b\u67c4\u64cd\u4f5c\u53d7\u4e0d\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1513146065, "timestamp_updated": 1513156150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38273826": {"recommendationid": "38273826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122903774", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1397, "last_played": 1516461926}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f53\u518d\u6b21\u54cd\u8d77Reset\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u611f\u52a8\u4f9d\u65e7\uff0c\u5f53\u7136\u65e5\u533a\u72ec\u4eab\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1513146018, "timestamp_updated": 1514346896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38273700": {"recommendationid": "38273700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020168121", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514922263}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't believe I didn't play this on PS2.

A critical success but  commercial failure, it's been heralded as iconic through the years, warranting ports to multiple consoles despite its consistently low sales. It's been called a masterpiece, a work of art, and one of the best games to come out of the noteworthy PS2 era --  and I think that it deserves that title. Games like Okami are special, rare things. They don't come around too often.\n\nThe first thing you notice about Okami are the visuals. They're eye-catchingly unique, resplendant in a gorgeous visual style and different from not just games that came out in its era, but from most games in general, Okami looks like an ukiyo-e painting come to life right on your screen, and it's part of why the game has held up so well over the years -- even the old PS2 release is still a joy to look at because of the art style, and it's easily one of the more defining aspects of this title.\n\nBut Okami is more than just style, and it packs enough substance to rival any RPG of its era. Expect to sink 50+ hours into this game (at the least!) because it is PACKED with content! The main storyline is full of memorable characters and moments both poignant and thrilling, and the game world is gigantic, but never feels overly-inflated because of the well-designed and diverse areas you have available to explore. There's treasure to find in every corner and tons of secrets to uncover, with sidequests and minigames and all kinds of other adventures to have on top of the main event! Everything from digging underground for water to fishing up a whole ocean's worth of fish, playing something akin to whack-a-mole with actual moles and rolling various things up a hill to a big sleepy bear, all while restoring nature to a cursed land and unveiling its secrets -- Okami never runs out of things to do, and it's fun and frustrating in equal measure (and so very hard to put down once you sink back into the game!) \n\nNo review of Okami would be complete without mentioning it's most well-known mechanic -- the ability to directly interact with the game world via the Celestial Brush. The Celestial Brush is a powerful and fascinating tool gives you the power to change the world around you, and it really helps to set Okami's mechanics apart. You can turn day to night and blow the leaves off the trees, just as you can bring life back to a barren wasteland and call down lightning to zap your foes (and unsuspecting townspersons!)  You can make platforms appear -- or create them outright -- and call down vines to carry you somewhere you can't get to on your own, and you can fix broken bridges just as you can slice just about anything in half -- it adds a whole new layer of gameplay that makes you want to try everything and gives you the opportunity for exploration -- and even some customization here and there -- that really keeps you engaged in what's happening, at least to me. It's fun, too -- and sometimes something just being plain FUN is special in its own right!\n\nThere's a ton of interactivity in this game, where little things you do affect the world just as much as the big ones, from barking at stray dogs (they'll bark too!) to using your Celestial Brush to make the wind blow and confuse townsfolk, Okami seems to have an answer for every move you make. And on top of that, you can feed and befriend basically every animal you meet -- and you'll get rewarded for doing so! Dogs, horses, tigers... for people who like to collect things, there are multiple catalogs you can fill, from the treasure you've found to the animals you've fed -- I cannot overstate the delightful amount of content packed into this title. Okami features an amazing bestiary as well that catalogues all of the enemies you fight in the form of a gigantic scroll with painted images of each one. As the completed images reveal themseves across multiple related entries to be more than just a splash and a text blurb, it gives a real sense of accomplishment for completing it all and taking on even the most difficult enemies in the game. \n\nYou can probably finish Okami in 50 hours, but I've sunk over a hundred into it before just running around doing everything. It's nice to have a game with hours and hours of things to do that doesn't ask anything more of the player than a single purchase price.\n\nOkami just feels well-crafted. Battling is fluid and fun and there are many ways to do it, with plenty of weapon combos to try and skills to unlock. Boss battles, too, are unique and exhilirating, and what worked for one might not work for another and can even backfire entirely -- and it's such a joy to experiment and to, basically, kick ass against your foes. It cannot be overstated how COOL it feels to just wail on a demon as a deity in the form of a wolf, whether it's with a mirror or a rosary or a sword -- and for anyone that cares, yes, you can evetualy learn a skill to lift your leg and pee on them for the added insult (and in fact, doing so, in addition to defeating enemies in a certain way, will even net you post-battle bonuses!) It's fun and it rewards inventive play -- but has a space for button mashers too in the form of the rosary weapon. You can tailor your own experience, and that means it's something many people can play -- and it helps that both keyboard and controller... controls... can be fully remapped to whatever you like. \n\nAs for this particular edition of the game, the port is solid. It supports 4k resolutions and so far, I haven't found any bugs. It picked up my controller from the get-go as well, and the game runs as smoothly as can be. It is capped at 30fps, but every release has been; Okami was originally coded that way, and due to its record of selling terribly, Capcom simply didn't have the budget to recode the game from the ground up -- as changing the framerate renders the game unbeatable and breaks jump mechanics outright. (It doesn't help that the studio who originally created this title folded years ago and is no longer working at Capcom to assist in the rebuilding efforts.) The loading-screen minigames have finally returned as well after their long hiatus -- but the ending theme, Reset, is still conspicuously missing from this release, to the disappointment of everyone (and me in particular.) But overall, it's a solid release within the constraints Capcom had to work with, and there are no problems I have found with the game itself or its gameplay on PC. (Though caveat emptor -- there seems to be some pricing shenanigans in other regions' markets, so keep an eye on that!)\n\nIn all, Okami is a real treat of a game with a huge world to explore full of fun characters, mysterious dungeons, and vicious enemies, all wrapped up in an eye-catching shell of gorgeous graphics and tied in a ribbon of storyline that holds your attention from start to finish. (The soundtrack is also impeccable, just for the record.) Objectively, it runs well and has a ton of content to experience -- and subjectively... \n\nThis game feels like coming home after all these years, it's so special and charming to me personally, and I'm honestly really happy that it's finally HERE, on PC, where I can gift it to my friends and they can finally experience it, too. I've wanted Okami on PC for years. That it's finally here, that I can write this review... it's a bit of a dream come true for me. This is such a special game -- I really hope that this review encourages someone else to explore how special it is for themselves.\n\nTL;DR: IT'S A GOOD GAME BRENT\n(The graphics look great the port plays fine and if you've never played it before you're in for one hell of an adventure!)\n\nThank you for reading!", "timestamp_created": 1513143002, "timestamp_updated": 1513143002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851013", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38273199": {"recommendationid": "38273199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076680866", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 60, "last_played": 1515308259}, "language": "english", "review": "Thanks for the Skip Button, Capcom!", "timestamp_created": 1513142851, "timestamp_updated": 1513145768, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541985", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38273073": {"recommendationid": "38273073", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966518036", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513658572}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been waiting for Okami to come to Steam - it is an awesome, wonderfull rendered game.

The controls don't feel as fluid as I'd like, but I'm biased towards the Wii controller/nunchuk since it felt a bit more like you were holding a paint brush. \n\nI enjoy this game for its music, art style, rich culture and nod towards Shinto. I don't know if I'd say that it has replay value, but it'll certainly take you several hours to put a dent in it (1 hour intro you can't even skip). Also, for you completionists out there, you can spend hours trying to find all of the clovers and astral beads. \n\nEach time you learn a new brush skill, or turn a barren patch of land vibrant again, or even feed animals you come across, there is a sense of accomplishment and you are rewarded with a visual treat. \n\nIf you've never played Okami and it sounds like something you'd enjoy, I'd say grab it.

THAT BEING SAID, if you can ignore these pretty bad issues (since you need a good camera for combat and the brush is super important), you can eventually adjust to them and find some enjoyment out of the game, but i don't think that the player should have to make compromises to make up for a not so great port.\n\nand before some idiot wonders why i have a bunch of time on the game and why i don't just return it: it was a gift from a friend and i really wanted to give the game a fair shot, despite what the people in the comments apparently think.  as it is, i can only play it in short bursts before my hand becomes a terrible claw of pain or for as long as i can stand the bad camera and brush stuff. take that as you will.", "timestamp_created": 1513132395, "timestamp_updated": 1513199316, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.318546", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38270603": {"recommendationid": "38270603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085045446", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513115976}, "language": "english", "review": "it was good on PS2 and so far good on PC\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boel8ddwdXM&feature=youtu.be", "timestamp_created": 1513131960, "timestamp_updated": 1513131960, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38270591": {"recommendationid": "38270591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067808906", "num_games_owned": 334, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513131910}, "language": "english", "review": "This HD version's selling point might be somehow supported by childhood nostalgia.

I did not get into it very far. my 40 minutes in game was mostly spent reading text and clicking enter. this is going to go over the techniacl aspects of this game as a port NOT the gameplay or the story itself (there are tons of reviews for the original game, go look up those). The game initially gave me the few settings that i think are important for a pc port. Resolution, (it let ME go up to 1080p) refresh rate, (a little weird it let me go to 144 since the game is capped at 30FPS in game and 60FPS in menu) and windowed borderless (also weird since the main benefit to me for borderless is the freedom to mouse over to my 2nd monitor, more on that later) \n\nThe graphics look old, or \"classic\" if that's what you're looking for. Which is hit or miss for people. I presonally did not mind the older style graphics, but i was also under the impression that they would take the original Okami and give it some amazing eye candy. But after doing some research i found something interesting. THIS IS NOT A NEW HD REMAKE of the original Okami like i assumed it was. It is a port of  \"Okami HD\" that was realeased on ps3. The HD graphics are not what i would call current HD graphics. They are the same HD graphics from 2012.\n\nThe keyboard and mouse controls don't feel smooth or well thought out. Being locked at 30 fps gives the mouse a huge amount of input latency that i am not used to with my 144hz monitor, (but for people used to 30 fps on pc or maybe even 60 this might be fine for you). so it came at a big shock and was dissapointing. On top of that when i tried to use my xbox one controller (both wirelessly through a dongle and cabled with micro usb) the game did not register it. This seems to be an issue for some people and not others, so your milage may vary. So i was stuck with mouse and keyboard. \n\nThe UI does not feel natural and is one of the main reasons i can not say this is a good pc port. you have to navigate the settings with WASD and your mouse is never given the freedom to control it (which on a game released on PC seems terrible, and shows me that the devs didn't really give it any thought). Other various little things, like alt tabbing would change the game from fullscreen windowed to windowed at a lower resolution (1600x by something, i can't really remember) which then you need to go back to the main menu to re adjust those settings. (because it doesn't let you change it in game) And even after that i wasn't given the freedom to move my mouse over to pause my video on my 2nd monitor. \n\nThe game locks your mouse into the window at ALL times, meaning that i couldn't even do the simplest thing to close it (being clicked the X to close the window)  I had to back out of the game after saving, skip past the intro cinimatic (who knows why it plays everytime you go back to menu) and then click exit game.\n\nFor disclaimer for the next section, i have  I7-7700k and GTX 1070. the game ran at a rock solid 30 fps (lol) the entire time for me at high settings (but if it didn't i doubt it would run well for anyone) But what was concerning to me though was  that this game was using up 50% of my CPU BY ITSELF while at the same time only using 5% of my grpahics card. I don't know why it was hitting my CPU that hard and not even touching my graphics card. But that was just another sign to me that this game was not a good port.\n\nBesides that there isn't much else to say. there were several other points that made me think this is a clunky and not well thought or worked out port. If all you want though is to replay the old Okami HD without having to dig out your old PS3, this game is perfect for you. But if you are like me and were looking for a remastered version of the game for PC that gives you all the benefits of your higher end hardware, this is not for you. i have already recieved a refeundsince there were to many imperfections in it for my taste.

Y lo adoro con toda mi alma. Okami es una joya de la \u00e9poca de PS2 que si no pudiste probar en su d\u00eda, ahora puedes hacerlo y de mejor forma que nunca. \n\u00c9ste es, sin lugar a dudas, un muy buen port, y uno de los mayores puntos a favor que he visto es su optimizaci\u00f3n. He probado el juego a m\u00e1ximos con un i5-6300HQ y una 960M de 2GB en port\u00e1til. El procesador, que es de lo que m\u00e1s chupa, no ha subido de 60\u00baC en todo el rato, y la gr\u00e1fica pr\u00e1cticamente no trabajaba, es simplemente incre\u00edble.\nEst\u00e1 capado a 30 fps, pero tenemos que tener en cuenta que tanto la versi\u00f3n de PS2, como la de Wii, como el port HD para PS3 trabajaban bajo un c\u00f3digo basado en los 30 fps. Y a\u00fan as\u00ed el juego se ve hermoso, precioso. Si te llama la atenci\u00f3n aunque sea un poquito, d\u00e1le una oportunidad. \nNo tengo mucho que decir respecto al juego en s\u00ed, para mi es el que mejor usa la f\u00f3rmula Zelda sin ser un Zelda, y tanto la historia como el apartado art\u00edstico, as\u00ed como su banda sonora, me parecen una maravilla. Espero que con su llegada a Steam el juego sea apreciado como de verdad se merece. \n\nPros:\n-Buena optimizaci\u00f3n.\n-Los 30 fps, s\u00f3lidos como rocas y m\u00e1s fluidos de lo que pueda parecer.\n-Un juego muy redondo, con una f\u00f3rmula basada en Zeldas como Twilight Princess o Wind Waker.\n-El sistema de combate, variado y con combinaciones de armas varias.\n-Poderes obtenibles conforme avanza la aventura, as\u00ed como t\u00e9cnicas de combate que puedes canjear en el \"dojo\".\n\nContras:\n-El idioma ingl\u00e9s. (Aunque si tienes conocimientos b\u00e1sicos, deber\u00edas poder defenderte frente a \u00e9ste t\u00edtulo).\n-El juego tiende a cambiar a modo ventana si tabuleas. Recomiendo jugar en ventana sin bordes.\n\n9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1513130687, "timestamp_updated": 1513131497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.775465", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38270220": {"recommendationid": "38270220", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998252340", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513111257}, "language": "english", "review": "POS game doesn't detect controllers unless you're in \"Big screen\" mode, and it's a straight port of the PS3 version which means PS3 textures, which is hardly \"HD\" for PC\n\nCouldn't refund fast enough, talk about the mother of all oversights and I won't support such shoddy dev work", "timestamp_created": 1513130318, "timestamp_updated": 1513130774, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.176560", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38270178": {"recommendationid": "38270178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080502398", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515233289}, "language": "english", "review": "My BONEr has never been this hard before.", "timestamp_created": 1513130131, "timestamp_updated": 1513130131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480410", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38270128": {"recommendationid": "38270128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076296552", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1515873260}, "language": "english", "review": "The definitive version of a classic PS2-era masterpiece.\nOriginal game had an amazing soundtrack, a great sumi-e style graphic style, and charming and witty plot filled with traditional Japanese folklore, humour, and detailed natural-feeling character development. \nThe \"Celestial Brush\" mechanic works great on X360/DS-style controllers, but also works surprsingly well with the classic PC Mouse+Keyboard setup, too!\nCalling the original game \"beautiful\" is a gross understatement, and experiencing this in 2017 in its 4K resolution(s) and hi-quality audio remastering is a treat that I'm honestly spoiled to experience for just $20.\n\nAn easy 10/10 score for both the original game, and also now for the ability to play this natively on Windows/Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1513129858, "timestamp_updated": 1513129858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515349", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38270111": {"recommendationid": "38270111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061611937", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "last_played": 1515351921}, "language": "english", "review": "Prepurchased it, downloaded it, just started playing it and it an amazing game that I would recommend to anyone.

[/spoiler]\n\nNow:\nAfter the first few minutes (16 to be exact), I felt all the childhood memories resurface in my mind, the excited fan inside me screaming to continue in this beautiful game. Used to play the game on the Wii with 480p resolution on a small screen, now with 1440p on a computer monitor large enough to be fully immersed in this work of art, I can't begin to imagine what 4K will look like. Not only all the textures are sharp, but the added post processing effects from the original on PS2 makes the experience simply better.\n\nThis newest edition of Okami allows both controller and keyboard/mouse support, the game open to the Playstation or the \"Wii\" playstyles. I have not tested the controller part yet, however for the keyboard/mouse part, all the controls can be rebound to your heart's content. The camera is controlled by the mouse, in case you are wondering.\n\nUsing the Celestial Brush feels natural, comfortably giving you full control on your line work without horrid wavering drawing (Wii version with its Wiimote not being stable in your hand, for example). I miss the ability to change the thickness of the brush freely like on PS2, although at least there's the ability to paint a constant, thicker line instead.\n\nYou can also change the refresh rate of the game, as well as the resolution and if you want it fullscreen, windowed, or borderless windowed. Either you can't change to a 1920x1200 resolution if you don't have a 16:10 screen (even if your 16:9 screen is bigger than that), or it's locked at 4:3 and 16:9 only. You might get some black lines if you are using a 16:10 screen.\n\nWith all the positive above, I do have to point out the controls overall can take a little while to get used to. As for framerate, the Fan Menu can go at 60 fps, while the game itself seems to be capped at 30 fps. In any case, the framerate of the game was not wavering at all on either situations, which is a mega plus compared to, say, an emulator.\n\nOverall, the game compared to its predecessing versions is simply stunning, completely worth the $20.00. This 30 hours game is a masterpiece, a classic, and simply a unique and fun experience. Now's your chance to play this amazing, way underrated work of art!\n\nP.S.: For the artists out there, try out your drawing tablets with the game and see if it works. If you can move your mouse cursor with a pen, so should the camera and Celestial Brush. This can be a unique way to play~\n\nEDIT: I forgot to point out by default, the right mouse button makes the alternate, thicker line. Now if you have some sort of plugin for a PS3 controller for detecting analog inputs, I wonder if the game will still recognize that data and allow you to draw variable lines, like on PS2...\n\nUPDATE: I can confirm that Okami is playable with a drawing tablet like Intuos Comic and the likes. It actually makes for a very interesting playstyle! However, the camera is a little bit hard to control unless you have a very high sensitivity, since you can't just reposition your pen like you would with your mouse in this case. For the first time, I finally was able to really draw in Okami...\n\nTIPS:\nIf you need to walk [spoiler]for the \"Pick Nami's clothes\" minigame[/spoiler], hold B on the keyboard. It will make Amaterasu walk instead of run when you move around.\n\nPressing the Fan Menu button twice allows you to skip nearly all dialog in the game, without the need to complete the game first.\n\nApplying Gold Dust on weapons apply different visual effects on them, no matter how subtle they are.

Rarely in gaming do the 'fruits of your loins' pay back in full as much as they do here. You are literally bringing colour and life back to the land of Nippon, and it's no hyperbole to say I've never wanted to see every single corner of a game world as much.\n\nWhen an evil Orochi spirit is released upon the world once more, It's time for the gods to re-appear and throw back the dark tide. Enter Japanese Sun-Goddess Amateratsu, taking the guise of a legendary white wolf. Armed with her magic paint brush, she must utilize all her weapons and bring the world back to life with her magic brush strokes.\n\nSounds awful right? Well it isn't. It's superb. Never before or since have I seen combat mechanics quite like these. Instead of traditional attacks, you 'paint' your offensive attacks with your brush (Straight line for a slash attack. Draw a bomb for explosives etc;). So instead of generic cover shooter nonsense, you have to think about your attacks carefully. Each enemy has a certain weakness that must be exploited through the different brushstrokes you amass (13 in total).\n\nJumping from 3D to 2D seemlessly (See Nier), the world is so fabulously realized, that it's simply a joy to run around, get lost, search for items, and slowly turn it from a sickly green to all the sparkling colours of the rainbow. When a land gets rejuvenated and the hills and fields explode back to life, your jaw will hit the floor. Meld all of this with wonderful think pencil style graphics and one of the best scores I've ever heard, and it begs the question why this never took off.\n\nCritically it was a darling. But commercially it died. So that's where we come in. PC users are a classier bunch. We don't buy a product. We buy games for us. Not because Sony or XBox tell us. We buy games for us. The fact that Okami never sold is lamentable indeed. The fact that it's available now for us, is to be cheered. If you want to be reminded why you love games, then look no further. Zelda? Mario? Uncharted? Okami beats them all (It's Platinum Games, what do you expect?).\n\nSo give this one try, guys and girls. Okami. HD.

I had played 40 hours of this game for PS2 back in the day. Always wanted to replay it and more than happy to spend the $20 for it. As a humble monthly subscriber was able to get a discount in the humble store, anyway. \n\nIt's my personal all-time favorite game. Wolves were - and continue to be one of my - favorite animals, and playing as a sun goddess in the form of a badass powerful wolf hit me in just the right places. The celestial brush is one of the most engaging mechanics in gaming and is done very well. \n\nThe story is amazing and I encourage new players to read through and suffer the cutscenes their first playthrough. Some information in the story is repetitive sure, and the final area [spoiler]being a huge recycle bin of all previous bosses[/spoiler] doesn't help that, either. For a game that lasts 40 hours and in spite of the issues of the final area manages to be engaging and fun the entire way is quite impressive. \n\nThe music and art direction are both impeccable. I can't imagine this game looking any different from the way it is. Some parts of the world are a 2D image that just grows bigger as you approach it and turns to face the camera, but rather than drawing away from the game graphically it draws you in with the art direction and has a function besides just being 'there.' \n\nThe world is open yet linear. You unlock new areas to explore as you progress through the story and can return to old areas with new abilities to discover new areas and receive more praise that was previously unattainable. Praise is your 'exp,' but you don't get it from killing monsters, you get it from doing things in the game world. Sometimes killing monsters nets you praise, but that depends on if it was part of specifically assisting someone in the world. \n\nI'm not sure what else to say about this game.

to it in no time, no worries), the game is overall visually pleasing and, mechanics wise, is pretty much the closest you can get to that classic, pre-BotW, Zelda feel. What's more: Okami doesn't need to hide at all from that looming franchise, since it understands how to succeed on its own merits - first and foremost of course its \"brush\" mechanics. Broken bridge? No worries. Just fix it by painting the missing parts with your brush.\n\nOkami is a feel-good game with a magical storyline, a ton of content and a style to die for. The opening is a bit sluggish, the camera controls are kind of reversed by default, and its sometimes a bit verbose, but considering the other, overwhelmingly positive qualities of the game, that's just whining on a high level. \n\nTrue treat to have it on PC now, and to a reasonable price.

Smooth game play with a very original mechanic, fantastic, timeless visuals, a fun and very eccentric cast, and a story that's basically the result of throwing the first volume of the Kojiki and the Tale of the Bamboo Cutter into a pot and giving it a good ol' whirl. That last point might not sound like much, but keep in mind that Japanese mythology actually features aliens and space ships.\nReally, if you are capable of liking things in general, I highly suggest giving this one a try. Just bring some patience as well; the game is most infamous for throwing about 15 minutes worth of unskippable lore into your face right at the beginning.\nNo issues on the technical side. The FPS limit sucks, but the game is just as amazing with or without it.\nIf you have issues with your gamepad, try starting the title in big picture mode.

It runs amazingly smooth - much better than it did on the PS2. No stuttering, no lagging, nothing. Yes, your 144hz monitor can run the game perfectly. If it doesn't, it's your specs, not the port. Be grateful the devs capped at 30 instead of putting out a broken game.\n\n- Yes, there is a controller bug. You CAN use your controller. Resetting steam has proved to help most people. Keep trying. Ignore the negative reviews toward this.\n\nReview:\n\nThis game is absolutely gorgeous. I have barely 30 minutes in game and already feel the need to brag about how happy and proud I am that this port didn't disappoint. Do yourself a favor and put it in 1920x1080 at 60hz and you're gonna have a beautiful time. This game is artistically pleasing as well as enjoyable with more than 45+ hours of gameplay (not including finding all of the stray beads). This is a game that you can come back to at any point and still enjoy no matter how many times you play the amazing story.\n\nWhile the game doesn't offer many graphic tunning options, they don't seem to be needed in or outside of combat. I was mostly worried about the motion blur making me sick but it's not at all bothersome. Runs the way it did on PS2 and Wii but without the stuttering or distorted figures (y'know, those old green and pink blobs?). The specs on the storepage are all wrong but it only seems to be a bit CPU heavy. Nothing too bad, however. \n\nThis game is an absolute steal at $20.

There is plenty of content here to have you playing for at least 45 hours or more. Fans of the series and newcomers should check this game out, especially if you love Zelda. \n\nAlso to note, its great for those with low spec rigs. Right now I'm not even playing on my gaming PC, I'm playing this on a surface pro 4. Sure I have to lower the resolution down sub 1080p, but the game is able to run really well on an integrated graphics card. I know that might sound like a strange positive to give, but I thought its worth noting that those with less than stellar rigs can still enjoy this game. EDIT - I can actually Run this at 1080p with mostly 30fps with the Surface Pro 4. So I can run this for certain at 900p.  So, to reiterate, this game will work well with low end hardware.\n\nHowever, there are some issues with the port.\nFirst of all, it doesn't support 16:10. I think its safe to assume ultrawide monitors will not be supported either.\n\n30FPS lock, makes mouse movement seem a bit odd.\n\nLimited Graphics settings. Only being able to choose between Low, Medium, and High\n\nNow, even though the mouse movement seems odd due to the locked frame rate, the core mechanic of the celestial brush does improve due to the mouse. \n\nAll in all, I do recommend this game. But if any of the port issues really affect you too much, I can understand as to why you may want to pass. \n\nBuy with caution.\n\nEDIT - Just to add, yes this game is 30FPS lock.

This is definitely one of \"those\" games, you know, the kind that stays with you no matter how old you were when you first played it. It takes you on a journey and makes sure you're having a blast all the way through, and despite some small annoyances, what you\u2019re left with after the credits roll is nothing but good memories.\n\n\u00d4kami is a third person action-adventure game that is very similar in terms of structure to a Zelda game. In fact, I\u2019d go as far as to say it is the best Zelda-like ever made. You take control of the japanese sun goddess Amaterasu as she is reborn in the body of a white wolf, and are tasked with bringing back light to the cursed land of Nippon.\n\nArmed with your divine weapons in the form of either a Reflector, a Rosary or a Glaive, and your Celestial Paintbrush, you explore a vast world that, while it can\u2019t hold a candle to gigantic open-world games of 2010 and beyond, still manages to be packed with a high density of very interesting content. As a new player, you\u2019re looking at 40 hours just to complete the story, and up to 80 hours if you\u2019re looking to get 100% completion, which, for 20 bucks, is pretty much a steal.\n\nThe story is long and epic, but doesn\u2019t take itself so seriously that you can\u2019t have good lighthearted moments with tons of charming characters. Encounters with friends and foes alike are memorable for all the right reasons, and that includes the exceptional soundtrack that, to this day, remains one of my favorites in gaming. \u00d4kami is inspired by japanese history and culture and it shows in every aspect of the game, including the instruments chosen for the soundtrack, the sumi-e artstyle that shall remain timeless and shines in high definition, and the story which borrows heavily from myths and legends from the land of the rising sun.\n\nYour main tool throughout the adventure is the Celestial Paintbrush, an ability that allows you to stop time at any moment, rotate the camera freely, and turn your screen into a canvas. Using either a mouse and keyboard or a controller, you can then draw symbols on the screen and watch them affect the world around you. From repairing a broken bridge by filling in the missing parts to slicing monsters in half with a well placed slash on your canvas, the possibilities are varied and your powers are put to good use in many situations. \n\nThis HD port for the PC runs at 30fps, which is unfortunate, but even as a devout follower of the Church of High Framerates, the subpar framerate never once bothered me. Which is weird because in a game like the first Dark Souls, I actively get distracted by the low framerate, but \u00d4kami somehow manages to be a smooth experience...go figure. No crashes to report on two different computers in over 40 hours of playtime.

Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun who possessed the white wolf Shiranui an age ago, returns in that same form in an attempt to repair the damage caused by the spiritual corruption left in the serpent\u2019s wake.\n\nSo what will you be doing in this game? Controlling a goddess incarnate in the form of a wolf, that\u2019s what! Roaming around the vast, beautiful realm of Nippon across vast fields, forests, snowfields and cities, you\u2019ll find many people who need your help \u2013 fulfilling their needs will make them happy!

Touch one \u2013 and a battle with colorful demons ensues! These run the gambit from simple imps who don\u2019t do much damage, to drum-playing misfits that can shoot their drums like cannon, to elementally-imbued spirits that require special skills to defeat! Use your fighting skills, the various weapons and items in your possession and the Celestial Brush in concert to defeat them and receive a bonus of Yen for taking less time and damage!\n\nAs you heal the land and make its inhabitants happy, so will you be made happy through this excellent, amazing adventure reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda, only instead of an elven boy, you play a wolf who can bark at will and harness godlike powers!

Okami exists to prove that the single player experience isn't dead, and it's consistent success on each subsequent re-release goes to show that people still want single player experiences they can enjoy.\n\nAt around a thirty hour experience to complete the story, assuming completion of most sidequests and prior knowledge of the game based on a previous playthrough, Okami still continues to deliver the same fun and beautiful visual adventure that it did when it first game out. It's cell-shaded Sumi-e ink style translates exceptionally well in HD and at almost any resolution, although the game does (very rarely) stutter during loading and it should be noted that the game's engine hasn't been changed from the PS2 days either. This means that while the game is exceptionally beautiful, you might still notice texture or object pop-in as you play - overall a minor complaint considering how staggeringly pretty the game is.\n\nA controller isn't necessary but is recommended for Okami, and the combat plays wonderfully smoothly. However, once again the game struggles from past flaws it has always struggled from; the game engine sometimes fails to recognise the Celestial Brush pattern you've used and this can be a little troublesome if it happens mid-fight or when you are low on ink pots during a mini-game. It's not a game-breaking problem, and generally it doesn't happen often enough for it to degrade the game to a point of frustration, but it's also a regular enough problem that it should be noted.\n\nThe simplistic nature of the game's RPG elements do the game a great service, with only two upgrades ever being related to combat: solar energy (your health) and ink pots (your mana.) Upgrades can be gained by prayer, and prayer can be gained simply by completing fights, feeding animals and performing miracles to restore the land of Nippon - meticulous players will be able to get their upgrades at very decent speeds, but players simply wanting to enjoy the game at a leisurely pace can also obtain upgrades in a timely manner and not feel pressured to do extra busywork if they don't want to.\n\nFinally, the story is generally well-written and well-crafted, though it struggles at points with very obvious \"filler\" sections that can make multiple playthroughs for stray-bead hunting a bit of a chore. The game's several unique bosses are all fun to face, but repeated face-offs with these same bosses can make their mechanics become dry and more bothersome to deal with than fun. While the story has good pacing overall, some sections do feel longer than others and can sometimes hold the story back just a little.\n\nIn conclusion, Okami is still as worthwhile to pick up today as it was to pick up when it first game out. The game has aged exceptionally well, and although it still suffers from the original flaws and complaints that it did on first release, those complaints are still minor and small enough that the game remains exceptionally fun to play through - either for the first time, or if you're a returning player, to revisit and relive. The musical score is still fantastic, ensuring the game has kept all of the original charm that it had and sometimes even making it tempting to just stay in one area to listen to the music and admire the art style as you play.
